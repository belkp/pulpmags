the sarge truly didnt know you-all
cared you-all is used in its correct
plural sense for the sake of our sub-
mason-and-dixon readers at least the
literary ouch extent of your emotional
fixations regarding him came as an over-
whelming surprise overflowed two drawers
of his desk and has him generally screaming
for mercy

  opinions were mixed some  involun-
tary devotees-why dont they turn to some-
thing else-wished to abolish your astral
agent complete with by-line xeno space-
gremlins and bad puns a total of  cheered
for more xeno and  of our alleged
readers voted for various modifications which
would retain the sarge but eliminate their
own pet peeves most of these edged toward
bitterness on the bad puns

were stringing along

  while never never a believer in modera-
tion ourself we have long since given up
supporting anything but the underdog so
and this was the idea all along we are string-
ing along with the middle-of-the-roaders
and as previously stated modifying the
sarge but when and if a bad pun occurs to
us we shall throw it as a sop to the multiple
majorities

  at any rate the postwar rubicon is cast
the bed is buttered and we shall lie in it-
lie and lie and lie let the sarge eat cake-
he goes for it in his present abstemious condi-
tion but if any of you is moved to send him
one put a file in it

the defense of bergey

  with such minutes passed into hours we
intend to launch ourselves upon the most
controversial issue since we did an off-to-
buffalo upon the ashes of the late adjective-
crazy howard phillips lovecraft the sarge
is finally rising to the defense of earl j
bergey

   it seems curious that a group of readers as
zealous toward their varied interests as the

bulk of those who contribute to the ether
vibrates should concentrate such a large
percentage of their cerebral acumen upon the
bems and hussies who populate our covers

  after all the purpose of such a magazine
as ss is to give its readers stories of the
highest obtainable calibre within the field of
its endeavors such lamb-chop lace panties
as illustrations and covers are more or less
catsup for those who cannot take their filet
mignon straight so for petes sake when
delivering your broadsides anent our un-
endearing and not-so-young charms con-
centrate your venom on the authors not the
artists-and remember to rattle three times
please

  actually earle bergey is one of the most
versatile and highly polished artists engaged
in the design and painting of magazine covers
today his knowledge of anatomy composi-
tion and color rate him in the front rank of
the topnotchers

  and brother hyenas he can draw a pretty
girl

our next issue

do you want to know what it would be
like to live in a united states devastated
by an atomic bomb attack would you like
to have to take to the heather like the ad-
herents of bonnie prince charlie in scotland

  probably not-but youre going to find out
in the laws of chance a full length
novel by murray leinster which will appear
in our next issue you will get a graphic
description of such a gopher-hole existence
which should linger a long time in both con-
scious and subconscious minds

write to this man

by fred c michel

  dear sarge just finished reading the july issue of
startling stories and each story was very good
especially the man with x-ray eyes there is
more truth than poetry in that story the letters were
very interesting and the comments after each missive
equally so

  as they sell your magazine in the px here it will
be my own fault if i miss the september issue i am
looking forward to after armageddon would
not mind reading a description of that future battle
as it gets lonesome here i would not mind getting

  okay people do your stuff

cwanofloppo

by chad oliver

  dear sarge it sends pangs of righteous agony lanc-
ing through my weary soul to admit in this age of
sarcastic culture and left-handed compliments that
i-i the green gwanofloppo-was actually stirred by
a story yet such was the case as i explored the
dark world with hankuttner that saturn old man
was great stuff

  it was perhaps a mistake to compare kuttner with
merritt because any comparison to merritt invaria-
bly places something of a handicap on the person
compared after all merritt was    merritt that is
indisputable fact i assure you and while some of
his work was far from great merritt at his best was
just about unbeatable the moon pool and creep
shadow-these were rare fantasy thrills

  but since the comparison has been made i shall
recklessly fling my twq coppers into the seething pot
kuttner at times did write very much like merritt-
witness chapter two and the characters of medea
and arles were very merritt-like but kuttner is too
fine a writer merely to ape the master the best parts
of the dark world were distinctly his own and at
no time did he copy merritt

  so much for comparison dat ol debbil the charac-
ters in the dark world were splendid-all of them
the writing was startlinclv free plug good the one
and only exception i will take with the tale is the
attempt to explain everything with science fantasy
should be just that in my opinion but it was a minor
point it didnt hurt the story to any great degree
and perhaps it will keep the anti-fantasy-we-want-
space-pirates mob silent

  the dark world was a sample of how fine stfantasy
can be i look forward to the time when these
samples the patient reader runs across become the

the star of life

 by edmond hamilton

      kirk hammond leads a future civilization in a desperate
      struggle against rule by a minority which derives its
      power through knowledge of the secret of immortalityi

chapter i

space doom

he didnt want to die it was all
very well to talk of facing death
with a valiant smile

a man could do that-at least it was
reasonable to assume that some men could if
they did it before witnesses the unquench-

able human vanity and desire for esteem
served to carry them through

  but he kirk hammond was completely
alone more alone than any man had ever
been before and he had to die what was
worse he had to do it by his own hand
that is if he were not to perish in a pro-
longed animal agony

  chin up he muttered to himself as he
went across the cabin of the little ship

an amazing complete novel


	startling stories

one turn of the valve and its all over

 it wouldnt work hammond couldnt
maintain that tone of ironic detachment
here by himself twenty million miles from
earth

  he gave it up and sat down with a dull
apathy on his dark haggard young face he
looked around the interior of the little ship

  sunlight blazing through the ports on one
side lit everything in the cabin to brilliance
the flanges of the rocket-throttles glittered
like gold the white tanks gleamed smoothly

  it was very silent the pioneer was out
here in space where there was no air and
no sound and it was gliding smoothly of
its own inertia on the vast elliptic orbit that
it would follow until doomsday

  hammond looked dully through the port
at earth off in the starry blackness it was
only a faraway fuzzy little green ball

  he thought of barnett and the others back
there on the colorado plateau waiting hope-
fully for him how long would it be before
the newspapers and television networks
would be running stories headed kirk
hammond believed lost-daring
mars-flight attempt unsuccess-
ful

  there would be others to try the crazy
stunt of course in the last forty years ever
since world war two had ended one rocket-
ship after another had tried for the nearer
planets all kinds of designs had been tried
and not one of them had come back

 kirk hammond and his partners had
planned something new-a one-man ship
a large crew they reasoned meant too
much space taken for air and water and
food by making use of mechanical controls
one man would be able to handle the pio-
neer

 hammond had won when they had drawn
lots for the job won what he asked him-
self now a chance for glory he had
thought then a one-way ticket to nowhere
he knew now

  the pioneer had been good-but not good
enough she had taken off well enough and
had been ten million miles out when his
instruments had shown a gravitational drift
whose existence had not been calculated by
the theorists back on earth

 hammond had fought the drift he had
fought until his last drop of rocket-fuel was
gone first to break back into his course
toward mars later to turn back to earth
but it had ended with his fuel gone and

the little ship fixed in an unalterable orbit

  that orbit would take it clear out of the
solar system it was going out into the
darkness and cold beyond pluto and nothing
could stop it its orbit was a vastly elon-
gated ellipse and that meant that somewhere
far out there it would turn and come back
toward earth by the time that happened
he would have been dead a long long time

 hammond had spent two weeks in the
dead ship two weeks that seemed an eter-
nity the food and water were all gone now
the air was almost gone too he knew that
he would die soon of asphyxiation unless he
took the painless way out

  if i could only send back word of that
drift he thought heavily everybody who
tries will run into it but someday some
lucky guy will get through

but there was no way of communica-
tion the heaviside layer screened
earth even if he had had a large enough
radio transmitter

 hammond knew what he had to do he
had to open the space-door and let death
hit him quickly and save himself a lot of
agony

  he went to the door and laid his hand
upon the valve there was a hard tight
lump in his throat and in his brain the
blind will to live was frantically suggesting
impossible hopes

  dont do it dont open the door maybe
the ship will get out of this maybe someone
will come in another ship-

  crazy impossible he knew all those fleet-
ing hopes to be it was only his subcon-
scious putting up a last fight against his
reason

 hammond knew the pioneer would stay
in its vast orbit for countless centuries and
nobody would come-it would be years be-
fore another ship would try the mars flight
and even if spaceships got as thick as black-
berries out here theyd never find his tiny
circling tomb

  hammond fought down all those ideas he
had to do this thing quickly or he would
not do it at all he put his hand on the
smooth rim of the big valve that opened
the space-door and started turning it

 the door went puny and cracked open
several inches the screech of air whistling
out of the ship knocked hammond over on
hands and knees at the same moment he
felt an awful agonizing sensation of cold
hammond picked up a itylus-like pencil and hastily drew a tiny rocket-ship chap iv


it	startling stories

  this death was not as painless as he had
expected that was kirk hammonds dying
thought

           chapter ii
           return to life

hammond awoke slowly first to a
kind of numb awareness and then to
consciousness of a screaming roaring sound
and then all the devils of the pit began stick-
ing red-hot needles of agony into his body

  how could he awake when he had died
that was hammonds first dazed bewildered
thought the thing was impossible yet he
was awake

  he was rolling back and forth on the
floor of the pioneer the little ship was cork-
screwing crazily and the screaming sound
came from the air that was screeching past
its hull and was roaring into the half open
door

  air air out here in space kirk ham-
mond wondered numbly

  curiosity is the strongest human trait
in the last analysis it was what kept ham-
mond from sinking back into a wretched
coma

  he wanted to know about that air he
had to get up to find out so he exerted
every effort of his will to move

  he couldnt he couldnt even open his
eyes he was kirk hammond and he was
still somehow alive but his body was a
useless mass of flesh that could do just one
thing-hurt

  it hurt with sharp increasing agony
hammond breathed in jerky tortured gasps
and each gasp was a fiery sword through his
lungs he would have screamed from that
pain if he could have done so

  the floor got warm under him then hot
hammonds mind detached from his help-
less agonized body figured out in a dim
remote way that the friction of air was
heating up the pioneer

  then he got his eyes open the interior
of the ship was just the same except that
insteed of the bright sunlight there was a
thin ghostly starlight for illumination

  hammond could see the star-field outside
the ports slowly revolving and knew by
that that the ship was rapidly turning as it
rushed through the air what did it all

mean he had to get up and see

  his hands and knees would hardly support
him when he got up on them the roaring
air that came in through the partly open
door was hitting him like an invisible solid
fist

  it was out of the question to try to stand
up on the floor of the corkscrewing ship
even if he had had the strength hammond
crawled toward the wall gripped a stan-
chion and pulled himself up to a porthole

  what he saw hit him a stunning shock
directly underneath the pioneer the whole
of starry space was blotted out by an enor-
mous shadowed greenish sphere

  the gleam of seas and the dark outlines
of land were plain as a map on its face he
was no more than forty miles above it
and it was earth

  by heaven the pioneer returned in its
orbit and is falling back to earth cried
hammond wildly excited and suddenly
hopeful

  that was the only explanation but it
didnt explain the biggest mystery of all it
didnt explain why he was still alive when
he had died

 then hammond began to see how that
might have happened suppose instead of
being really dead he had only been in
suspended animation suppose he had been
in temporary coma from the freezing cold
of space

 it wasnt impossible hammond remem-
bered that even away back in the s
scientists had put men and women into a
frozen sleep a form of suspended anima-
tion in which every cell of the body was
suddenly frozen rigid the quickness of it
prevented organic or cellular damage and
the subject could be revived day later by
application of warmth

  maybe that was what he had been in a
deeper frozen sleep and then the pioneer
had come back to earth and the air and
increasing warmth of the friction-heated
hull had gradually revived him

  hammond was to learn later how nearly
correct his theory was but at the moment
he swiftly forgot it for he suddenly real-
ized that he had come back to life to die
again quickly

  the pioneer was falling at ever-increasing
velocity through the uppermost atmosphere
of earth it would presently hit the surface
and he had not a drop of fuel left with which
to brake its fall
the star of life	

  if i could use the fins to glide down to
a skip-landing- hammond said hoarsely
to himself

  he crawled toward the pilot-chair as he
strapped in he felt his brain blacking out
from the spin of the falling ship he fought
against unconsciousness there was a slim
chance left if he could stay awake

  the pioneer was equipped with stubby
rudder fins to help it land on its return to
earth hammond pulled up the tail-fin
control the corkscrew gyrations of the ship
levelled out into a steep downward rush

  but the dark land-masses and starlit seas
of nighted earth were still leaping up toward
hammond at appalling speed

  if i only had fuel to use the brake-blasts
for a minute he thought hopelessly

  the ship veered left in its downward rush
as he twisted the fin-lever it headed toward
the nearest of the starlit seas

  hammond used the tail fins to pull up the
nose of the ship a trifle more he was pray-
ing to clear the dark land and hit the sea
at the flattest possible angle the hull of
the little ship was dull red with friction as
it screamed down over the dim coast of the
land and struck the ocean

  the pioneer hitting the sea at that flat
angle skidded across its surface like a skip-
ping stone it was what kirk hammond
had wildly hoped for-a skip-landing that
would avoid a direct crash

  but the skips of the ship wert a half-mile
each and each time it came down and grazed
along the surface of the water the crash
tore plates and fins loose and flung ham-
mond against the chair-straps

  crash-crash-crash-coming at briefer
intervals then there was a roar of water
outside and next moment water poured into
the pioneer in a solid rush as the little ship
began swiftly to sink

  that rush of water revived kirk ham-
mond a little from the stunning shocks he
fumbled to unbuckle the chair-straps even
as he did so the pioneer was sinking like a
stone

  hammond floundered frantically through
rushing water toward the door he got to
it and clung to its lip but couldnt get
through it it was choked by stuff that
jammed its opening cushions and plastic
cases and other things that would float

  he made a final wild effort and scraped
through he went up like a rocket through
the warm waters got his head out of the

water into starlight and soft air then gulped
sea and went under again

hammond realized later that he would
have drowned then very quickly had
not his floundering arms struck something
buoyant and floating it was one of the seat-
cushions of the ship they had been made
like everything else in it to save weight
and were of rubberoid inflated with helium
thus they had floated up through the open
door

 hammond got his arm hooked through
the loop that had been attached to make the
cushion a life-preserver in case of just such
a landing presently he glimpsed another
bobbing cushion and got that also the two
held him up perfectly he breathed in great
gasps for a long time floating under the
bright white stars then he began to paddle
weakly in the direction of the dark land

  his mind was still as numb as his body
was weak but gradually lying on his back
and urging himself feebly through the water
a strange realization entered his brain he
had been looking up dazedly at the solemn
vault of stars while he paddled and he
realized now that there was something
wrong with them

  hammond knew the constellations thor-
oughly he had studied them for years in
preparation for his flight and as time passed
he now became aware that their movements
were not right

  the northern constellations were in the
sky which meant that he was in the northern
hemisphere of earth and ursa major and
draco and the other northern star-groups
were revolving slowly about the celestial
pole

  but the pole-star was no longer polaris
it was a fainter star that he recognized as
delta cygni many degress across the heav-
ens from the former polar star

  but that means hundreds of years have
gone by-thousands thought kirk ham-
mond

  the celestial pole constantly changed posi-
tion in the heavens due to the phenomenon
of precession of the equinoxes every twenty-
seven thousand years it described a small
circle in the north sky

  if the pole was now delta cygni it had
described more than a third of that circle
and that meant that ten thousand years had
passed since his own time

 hammond felt the staggering shock of
	startling stories

this thoroughly incredible realization
  ten thousand years

chapter iii
new earth

an odd thought was uppermost in
hammonds mind had he lain in
frozen sleep that long in the pioneer as it
followed its vast elliptic orbit out into outer
space and back again to earth had he

  the thought was mind-cracking if that
were true countless generations had risen
and died on this planet races and empires
and faiths had flashed forth and blown away
like candles in the wind during that frozen
slumber that had seemed so brief to him

  and if that were true all on earth whom
kirk hammond had known were dead for
ages their dust dispersed and their memory
forgotten

  barnett and jim cray and that girl in
pueblo and-

  hammond quit that he had to or lose
his sanity but as he paddled weakly on
through the warm water his mind continued
to whirl in fantastic speculations if ten
thousand years had actually gone by while
he slept what changes had they brought to
earth how far had humanity gone in that
time

  hammond had to dismiss that from his
mind at the moment for now the low black
line of the land was showing against the
starlit sea ahead he made out jagged black
rocks as he paddled nearer if the tides had
been stronger he would have been dashed
against them

  as it was he encountered only subdued
surf that sucked him between two craggy
boulders and deposited him on a little beach
of sand as gently as a mother would put
down a child

  hammond lay there for minutes breathing
deeply and not thinking the soft sucking
of the surf and the whisper of the breeze
were the only sounds there was a salt-and-
dried-weed smell about that was familiar

  then finally he got up hanging onto the
side of a boulder for support he looked
upward to verify that incredible change in
the northern constellations but as ham-
mond looked up he saw the firefly lights

  they looked like that-three or four fire-
flies flitting far out over the starlit sea
whence he had come they seemed to dance
and waver to spin and mill and spread out
in an ever-increasing area

  it came to kirk hammond that they could
not be glowing insects or they would not be
visible so far they must be vehicles or
planes of some kind bearing lights

 a hand suddenly touched hammonds
shoulder he uttered a strangled cry as
he turned then he saw that it was a man
who had soundlessly approached him on the
soft sand

  they stood eyeing each other the strang-
er had recoiled at hammonds hoarse excla-
mation and now stood looking doubtfully at
him in the dim starlight

  he was a big hulking individual with
bristling black hair and a massive cheerful
face he had naive friendly eyes that were
now puzzledlv inspecting kirk hammond
hammond gasped in astonishment either
the dim starlight was playing tricks upop
him or this big strangers battered massive
face was faintly blue

  the mans garments were quite simple a
jacket and loose trousers of dark cloth he
held raised in his right hand a slim gray
metal tube with an egg-shaped grip

  the thing looked like a weapon and the
big blue man kept it raised for instant use
yet he seemed excited rather than hostile
he spoke urgently to kirk hammond point-
ing hastily at the distant firefly lights

  hammond could not understand a word
he said it was not english nor was it any
other language he had ever heard that as
much as the mans outlandish blue skin con-
vinced hammond that he had actually crossed
a great period of time any language spoken
by a race of his own time would have sound-
ed at least vaguely familiar

the blue man seemed bewildered when
hammond showed his lack of under-
standing he pointed to hammonds head
then to his own then to the few fireflies
flickering out there over the sea

  vramen vramen he repeated urgently

  hammond couldnt get the connection yet
dazed as he was he could sense there was
a warning in what the other sought to con-
vey again the other man pointed to his
own head and then to hammonds-question-
ingly

  that made kirk hammond look at him
the star of life



more closely he discovered that around the
top of the blue mans skull was bound a
tight-fitting turban of metallic fabric

 vramen yelled the other suddenly
pointing westward

  hamomnd looked and saw that the fireflies
were separating one still hovered low above
a point out on the sea but the others were
quartering eastward over the ocean search-
ing

  his companion dragged hamomnd into the
shadow of the rocks he looked up from
there and saw one of the fireflies approach-
ing it was a vehicle that flew silently and
at great speed he could make out a long
transparent hull-the light from inside it
and its darting searching movements had
made hammond think of fireflies

  the big blue man was frantically unwind-
ing part of his metallic cloth turban was
using a knife to cut at the fabric

  hammond suddenly heard a voice inside
his mind it was a clear commanding voice
that spoke in his brain hypnotically author-
itative

  come from hiding and show yourself it
commanded signal your whereabouts to
us

  kirk hammond totally without volition
found himself starting numbly out of the
shadow toward the starlit beach

  the blue man reached for his ankles and
tripped him as hammond sprawled the
other hastily wrapped around his head the
length of metallic cloth he had cut from his
own turban at once the hypnotic mental
command stopped

  hammond found that he was shaking vio-
lently as though drawn back from the edge
of an abyss the whole swift experience had
been so unearthly that he lay there in the
shadow quivering like a hunted animal

  his companion seemed to take it all as a
matter of course the blue man lay looking
up shrewdly at the firefly ships that kept
darting to and fro quartering searchingly
over the starlit coast

  hammond began to understand a little
that mental command had come from the
searching ships the metallic turban was of
a material that shielded him from the hyp-
notic attack

  his companion uttered a grunt of satis-
faction the firefly ships were flying back

	startling stories

out to the one still hovering over the distant
sea

  sitting up the blue man looked at ham-
mond he still warily held his egg-handled
weapon but he seemed tremendously in-
terested finally he touched his own chest
and spoke

  rab quobba he said

 hammond could understand that he
touched and named himself

  hammond the other repeated accent-
ing it oddly he stared puzzledly at ham-
mond then pointed east and asked do
rurooma

 hammond didnt understand he made
a shrugging gesture to show his ignorance

 rab quobba frowned and pointed east
again rurooma dal vramen

 kirk hammond guessed he was being
asked if he had come from the place whence
the searching firefly ships came he shook
his head quobba seemed to make up his
mind he stood up motioned hammond to
accompany him and started southward along
the rock-strewn shore

  hammond hadnt the faintest idea where
they were going or who this big man with
the bluish skin might be but one thing
seemed clear the firefly ships were a men-
ace and rab quobba had been friendly at
least so far

  as they moved southward along the starlit
shore quobba kept when possible in the
shadow of the great boulders weakness
made hammonds legs leaden and he stum-
bled through the sand in a gathering daze

  he was aroused by a sudden flash of light
far to the east it struck down out of the
sky like a curved lightning-bolt leaving a
livid fiery trail as that trail faded there
came a distant twanging sound

feuobba in answer to hammonds
 wondering look pointed briefly up at
the starry sky and then eastward

  hammond wondered dazedly that fiery
downdarting flash had looked like the trail
of a descending spaceship then men had
conquered space by now perhaps even
interstellar space but if that were so why
were some men furtively hiding from others

 he was reeling and knew he could go
little further when quobba finally stopped
they were in the shadow of a towering
boulder the blue man looked carefully
around the heavens then spoke sharply

  a section in the side of the boulder swung
inward disclosing a dark aperture at first
hammond thought his eyes had deceived
him then he realized that the boulder was
a hollow clever camouflage

  quobba drew him hastily inside the open-
ing closed and they were in utter darkness
a globe overhead flashed into light

  hammond stared the interior of the huge
fake boulder was a small room there were
three other men in it men dressed also in
dark jackets and slacks two of them were
ruddy ordinary young earthmen of his own
age the other man whom quobba address-
ed as shawn tammas was-unusual

  shawn tammas was a wizened little man
with a wrinkled golden yellow face and
beady black eyes he had been chewing
something and showed green-stained teeth
when he exclaimed in wonder at sight of
hammond

  hammonds dazed gaze swept from the
men to the big machine or instrument that
occupied much of the room it looked like
a six-inch refracting telescope mounted on
a bulbous pedestal but its tube was of heavy
gray metal and instead of a lens at its end it
had a flared nozzle

  it looked like a bigger replica of the egg-
handled pistol rab quobba carried it might
be hammond thought that this was an
energy-gun of some kind he noted a ceiling
that could be slid aside above the weapon
this fake boulder might be a camouflaged
gun - emplacement

  but good heavens he thought stunned
if these are really energy weapons why
must they hide from anybody

  quobba drew him toward a pit that yawn-
ed at one side of the chamber a narrow
spiral stair dropped down this vertical shaft
hammond went down it with him the
wizened little yellow man called shawn
tammas accompanied them with monkey-
like agility

  there was white light below and they
went down into the light into a great room
or hall that had been squarely cut out of
solid rock

  the room was big and lofty brilliant
white globes in the rock ceiling shed a shad-
owless illumination around the walls were
unfamiliar machines tables of whirring in-
struments glittering metal assemblies this
big underground hall was some sort of work-
shop

  rab quobba took off his own and ham-
the star of life	

monds metallic turbans and stuffed them
into his pocket he and tammas led ham-
mond forward through the busy rock hall

  there were some two-score people work-
ing at the machines some were girls who
wore brief shirts and shorts most of them
looked like ordinary white-skinned earth-
men but there were a few who looked as
unusual as quobba and tammas-a couple
of stocky men with dull red skins a lanky
hollow-eyed man with a gray complexion

  hammond saw their curious staring faces
as though in a dream he knew that he
was nearly out and would have sunk to the
floor if rab quobba had not steadied him
as he led him across the hall

  wondering excited men and girls followed
they went through connecting rock halls to
a smaller chamber that seemed their desti-
nation here were shelves of curious metal-
bound books wall-charts of astronomical
diagrams a couple of littered desks

 ez jon wilson lanf do nos hoomen
quobba said to hammond pointing to the
man who was coming toward them

  jon wilson was an aging earthman his
hair iron-gray his gaunt strong face and
deep eyes those of a leader he looked at
kirk hammond with astonishment and
quick-mounting anxiety

  there was a girl at his side slender in her
brief garment her dark hair falling to touch
her bare shoulders in her hawk-pretty
face and clear black eyes was an equal won-
derment

  ez an do vramen she asked quickly of
rab quobba

  nun iva the big blue man exclaimed
his massive face was earnest as he made
rapid explanations pointing excitedly up-
ward

 to kirk hammond it was more like a
dream every minute the whole scene was
blurring he had kept going on sheer nerve
but now the inevitable reaction of weakness
was sweeping through him

  a tall hard-eyed man with sandy hair had
pressed forward beside jon wilson and the
girl iva this man was staring at hammond
with harsh suspicion

  ez fa vramen this individual exclaimed
when quobba paused a low angry mutter
of assent came from the little crowd

  quobba shook his head in angry denial

  ez nun gurth lund

 but the sandy-haired gurth lund had
drawn one of the egg-handled pistols and

his beady eyes were bleak as he raised it
toward hammond

  hammond guessed that they thought him
a spy or ally of the mysterious dreaded
vramen and ignorant as he was of their
language how could he tell them the in-
credible truth about himself

chapter iv
after ten thousand years

hammonds eyes fell upon the astro-
nomical charts on the wall and a
desperate hope made him stumble toward
them most of the charts seemed star-maps
of various regions of the galaxy but one
was a diagram of the solar system with all
the planets depicted in their orbits

  hammond picked up a stylus-like pencil
and hastily drew a small picture on it he
drew a tiny rocket-ship speeding away from
earth and with the crude figure of a single
man visible inside it

  he pointed to the ship picture then to him-
self it did not lessen the hostility of the
little crowd they pressed toward him threat-
eningly

  how can i tell them that i slept in the
ship for many centuries that i come from
the past kirk hammond wondered grog-

gily-

  he reached toward a chart that depicted
the northern constellations as seen from
earth with the crossed lines of the celestial
pole at the star delta cygni hammond
drew new crossed lines at the star polaris
he pointed to that then pointed again to the
little pictured ship leaving earth and to
himself

 some of them understood at once jon
wilson the leader did so the incredulity
in his gaunt face did not entirely disappear
but there came into his deep eyes an ex-
pression of dawning awe

  do phrann he breathed he and the girl
iva and almost all the others staring wonder-
ingly at hammond

  the bleak-eyed gurth lund spoke harsh-
ly skepticism strong in his attitude but big
quobba answered loudly

  and then the whole scene waltzed slowly
around kirk hammond as he staggered
from the cumulative effects of shock and
exhaustion
	startling stories

  quobba ran toward him he and the dark-
haired girl supported hammond with jon
wilson leading they helped him down a
corridor into another room

  it was a small sleeping chamber cut like
the other rooms of this strange underground
refuge from the solid rock hammond felt
them stretching him out in a narrow bunk
covering him with a silk-textured blanket
then sleep overwhelmed him

  he woke with the feeling that many hours
had passed he was weak and limp but no
longer felt that sickening dizziness he lay
for some minutes looking up at the rock
ceiling in which one bright white globe
shone softly

  it was all true then it had been no dream
that awakening of his in the rocket as it fell
back toward earth after its age-long swing
through outer space that strange hypnotic
attack by the firefly ships of the vramen
and his stumbling with rab quobba to this
underground town

  quobba himself appeared in a few minutes
with the girl iva the big blue mans massive
face grinned down at him cheerfully

ez nun do vramen he told hammond
reassuringly and then pointed to hammonds
zipper-jacket that hung nearby

iva was smiling at him too though with
a touch of awe in her clear dark eyes
and when jon wilson came in a moment
later to inject medicine of some kind into
hammonds arm he was reservedly friendly

  they had accepted him hammond realized
they believed now he wasnt one of the
mysterious vramen who were apparently
their deadly enemies something about his
jacket had corroborated his strange story

  then he understood in his jacket pocket
had been the book of mathematical tables
he had used in navigational calculations
that printed book of a long-dead past had
at least partly convinced them of his incred-
ible assertion that he himself came from
that past

 hammon had picked up one or two of
their words and now tried haltingly to use
them

 nun vramen he repeated pointing
weakly to himself im not of the vramen
then he pointed to them nun vramen

  iva shook her head almost fiercely her
mop of blue-black hair brushing her bare
shoulders

  nun-sin do hoomen

 hoomen that was what these people
called themselves it sounded very much
like human

  kirk hammond would have liked to learn
more but iva pressed him back down on
his pillow with firm little hands she spoke
what he knew was a command to sleep

  sleep was all hammond seemed to himself
to be doing in the next few days he was
feeling the full reaction from the ghastly
shock to his human frame of waking from a
frozen sleep of ages

 his weakness only slowly gave way to
returning strength but jon wilson and his
daughter for he had learned that iva was
such would not let him get up

  he spent most of his waking hours learn-
ing the language usually from iva wilson
she was a good teacher-she insisted on his
first learning a vocabulary from her pictures
and gestures and would not let him ask all
the questions with which he was bursting

 hammond wanted desperately to know
more about this strange future earth into
which he had been catapulted for there
were hours when he lay feeling a terrible
loneliness thinking of friends dead for ages
of all customs languages nations and races
that had been his own earth and were now
gone forever

  three sleep-periods or days had passed
before he was able to learn what he desired
by his fourth day in the underground refuge
of the hoomen kirk hammond was sitting
in a chair

 on that day jon wilson came with big
rab quobba and the little wizened golden-
skinned man named shawn tammas

  my daughter tells me that now you can
understand and speak at least the rudiments
of our language said the deep-eyed leader
kirk hammond nodded assent and im
glad of it there were a million things i
wanted to know

 we hope to learn much from you too
very much john wilson said gravely tell
me first is it true what you seemed to be
telling us that you come somehow from the
far past

  its true though i can hardly believe it
myself hammond said

  he told them of his attempted space-flight
and its disastrous ending of his death-like
sleep in space and final awakening

  jon wilsons gaunt face showed no signs
of incredulity at the story the hooman
leader appeared to possess considerable
the star of life

knowledge of scientific possiblities

  a catalepsis of suspended animation such
as you describe could easily result from the
shock of instantaneous freezing he mused
and when your ship finally fell back to
earth the vramen radiolocators picked it up
and thats why theyve been searching for
you ever since

  you mean that the vramen are still hunt-
ing for me hammond asked

on wilson nodded gravely

 they are combing this whole coast
we have not dared go forth onto the surface
since you came

 theyll keep up the search too curse
them rumbled big rab quobba his massive
blue face angry they never quit anything
wilson who are the vramen kirk
hammond asked tensely why are you
hiding from them and why are some of you
so strangely different like quobbas blue
skin and tammas golden one

  what lad have you never seen a gentle-
man of vega before that you wonder at my
color exclaimed big rab quobba

 shawn tammas cackled and spat green
juice of the root he was perpetually chew-
ing

 this youngster must come from the far
past indeed not to know a vegan and a
mizarian when he sees them

 vegan mizarian echoed hammond
incredulously you mean you are from
those distant stars

 its true hammond said jon wilson
you come apparently from a time in the
remote past when even interplanetary travel
had not yet been fully achieved

 but interplanetary space was soon con-
quered and later interstellar space also
was conquered by the invention of the space-



split drive that makes almost any speed
possible that opened up the stars of the
galaxy to colonization by earthmen

  so a great wide-spread hooman civiliza-
tion advanced through many star-systems
it now embraces a large part of the galaxy
being ruled by a government of the feder-
ated suns

 hammond was stunned what tremendous
progress had gone on in those hundred cen-
turies in which he had lain sleeping in his
ship

  we hoomen are all of the same species
all descended from the colonizing earthmen
wilson was saying but due to different
environments there are differences in pig-
mentation of our separate star-peoples
but if you hoomen colonized the galaxy
who are the vramen and why are you hiding
from them kirk hammond asked him be-
wilderedly

 jon wilsons gaunt face hardened and
there was a look of bitter hatred in his deep
eyes as he answered

  the vramen are a small exclusive caste
of men and women scientists who dominate
our galactic civilization they have no official
part in the government of the federated
suns they are comparatively few in number
and they have made many great scientific
discoveries which they have imparted to us
hoomen but we hate them because they
dominate the galaxy through their greatest
scientific secret of all-the secret of unlimited
life

  kirk hammond at first thought the other
was speaking figuratively then he asked
incredulously you cant mean-

  jon wilson nodded solemnly the vra-
men are immortal they never die except
by accident or injury some of them are four

	startling stories

thousand years old but their secret of im-
mortal youth keeps them unaging

  the hooman leader stared gloomily at the
wall as he unfolded his explanation

  it began some four thousand years ago
at that time certain hooman scientists were
exploring a dangerous cluster of stars in the
corvus region of the galaxy upon a mys-
terious world deep in that cluster a world
called althar those scientists found the
secret of immortality

  the discoverers used it to become im-
mortal and became the first vramen they
expanded their numbers by taking other
chosen men and women to the mysterious
world of eternal youth

  but they would not let the great masses
of the hoomen go there they jealously
guard the unknown secret of immortality
there for themselves for they know that
if we hoomen all became immortal they
would soon lose their dominance over our
civilization

  so far the vramen have been able to
direct the whole course of development of
our civilization because their immortality
gives them scientific powers far beyond any-
thing we short-lived hoomen can attain
but if we could become immortal also we
could end that domination why should
they live on like immortal gods patronizingly
conferring benefitsipon us when we could
direct our own destinies if we too lived un-
limited lives

  jon wilsons eyes were flaring now and
hammond saw in his face and in those of
rab quobba and shawn tammas the imprint
of strong passion

he felt that same resentment kindle
in himself at the picture they painted
a small exclusive caste of scientific super-
men hoarding eternal youth for themselves
to assure their dominance over the rest of
the race

  but if there are only a few of them why
dont you force them to relinquish their dom-
inating position hammond demanded

  they have powerful weapons like that
hypnotic amplifier wilson reminded their
unending lives give them the chance to
amass vast scientific knowledge and powers
then why dont you hoomen go to althar
and secure the secret of their immortality for
yourselves-make yourselves their equals
asked hammond

  tammas beady eyes twinkled at him

  this spaceman from the past is a lad
after my own heart

  shut up little monkey and let wilson
tell him growled quobba

  many hoomen in the past wanted to do
just that jon wilson said to win to the
mysterious world of althar and find the
secret of eternal youth despite the prohibi-
tion of the vramen but the vramen to
prevent that ever happening have required
the federated suns council to give them a
certain privilege that was the privilege of
keeping indirect control over all interstellar
ships

  every star-ship in accordance with that
law has built into it a secret device of the
vramen which can be used to explode the
whole ship if it goes into the forbidden
region of corvus cluster where the world
of immortality lies

  and also in each solar system there are
a handful of vramen who keep constant
check by means of super-radiolocator de-
vices over every star-ship that arrives at
or departs from that system

  thats why the vramen here swiftly ap-
peared to search for your ship rab quobba
put in to hammond their radiolocators
in rurooma earths capital must have shown
an unauthorized craft approaching earth

  yes and thats why the so-and-sos are
still combing the coast and keeping us
penned down here grumbled little tammas

  all those precautions jon wilson was
saying earnestly are to make sure that the
hoomen never are able to make a surrep-
titious attempt to reach the hidden world of
immortality but some of us decided to
defy the vramen and seek out the secret
on that forbidden world we formed a con-
spiracy to build secretly a star-ship that
would be able to reach mysterious althar

  kirk hammond instantly remembered the
big underground workshops through which
he had come the machines and metal assem-
blies

  youre building your star-ship down here
underground

  wilson nodded

  we have to its the only way to keep our
work hidden for were violating the law and
the prohibition of the vramen we are all
star-ship men and women with long ex-
perience in space quobba tammas gurth
lund all of us-we formed our plans in
rurooma and secretly prepared this hidden
workshop by using energy-blasters to cut
the star of life	

it out of the solid rock

  and here we are building a star-ship
which will not have the vramens device
built into it with it we mean to reach
althar and win the secret of immortality
that will make our hooman race independent
forever of vramen domination

chapter v
peril from the sky

kirk hammonds spirit soared to
quick warm sympathy with this little
band of determined men and women who
had already proved themselves his friends

  here was high adventure indeed such
adventure as he had not dreamed of when
he had taken off from earth ten thousand
years ago a forbidden quest for the great-
est secret of the starry universe

  but it was more than mere adventure it
was a struggle to release the whole human
race from the domination of the little caste
of supermen who held their authority only
because of their immortality it was a fight
for human rights such as instantly appealed
to him

  i dont know if youll have me or not
but id like to join you hammond said
earnestly

  rab quobba slapped him on the back

  i knew youd want to we can use him
cant we wilson

  jon wilson looked thoughtfully at him
you are as new to this age as though you
had just been born into it why should you
want to share this danger with us
because i am already one of you kirk
hammond said my own world my own
people are dead ten thousand years ago i
have to take up my life in this new age as
one of your hooman race

  i come from a time when we hated in-
justice and fought hard against it and it
is supreme injustice for the vramen to use
the secret of unlimited life to assure their
domination thats why im with you heart
and soul against them

  not that id be much good to you at
that he added ruefully i have no knowl-
edge of the star-ships of this time of your
science and machines

you have more than that hammond
jon wilson said quickly you have the

bold fighting spirit that is rarely found in our
race after all these thousands of years of
peace we can use that and we can teach
you about our ships and sciences

  can i see the work youre doing on your
ship now hammond asked eagerly

  the gaunt earthman shook his head
not yet you are still a little weak to-
morrow i will show you

  rab quobba and little tammas stayed
when wilson had gone and hammond plied
them with eager questions about the space-
manship of this age

  both the big blue vegan and the monkey-
like little mizarian were veteran star-ship
men for hours hammond drank in their
talk of the starways it was like a dream
realized for him to hear them the dream
of complete conquest of space was what
long ago had lured him from earth in the
flimsy little rocket-ship

  hammonds head spun with their tales of
spacemans life tales of the vast glooms of
cosmic clouds that ships rarely dared enter
of wrecks and castaways in the unexplored
fringes of the galaxy of strange races like
the thinking rocks of rigel and the fish-
cities of arcturus watery worlds and the
the unearthly tree-wizards of dark algol

  iva wilson finally chased the two spacemen
out of the room when she brought his
evening meal of synthetic nutrient jellies and
liquids iva also brought him word that he
had been provisionally accepted

  they have decided to enlist you as one
of us only gurth lund and a few others
argued against it

  hammond remembered that bleak-eyed
sandy-haired man

  what has lund against me

  nothing personally but he still was a
little suspicious that you might be a vraman
spy he argued that if you were you would
naturally seek to join us

  his logic is good enough hammond
admitted but you dont believe it iva

the dark-haired girl looked scornful
of course not the vramen wouldnt
use such a weak helpless person as you as
a spy

  kirk hammond laughed and the girl
flushed quickly

  oh i didnt mean it that way you
couldnt help being weak after all you went
through

  save your sympathy he grinned your
	startling stories

father says i can get up tomorrow

  on that next day hammond found himself
a little unsteady on his feet when he first
walked out of the sleeping-chamber but
strength came rapidly back to him he
walked with iva to the small room that was
jon wilsons study and the heart of the
underground project the hooman leader
was there with gurth lund

 lund came forward promptly with his
hand extended and with all hostility gone
from his square face

  youve been accepted and that settles
everything he told hammond bluntly i
hope you dont hold what i said against me
of course not if anyone had dropped in
on me with a story such as i told id have
been as incredulous as you were

  so you become one of us jon wilson
said gravely to hammond i cant help
thinking that it is fate that sent you to us
so strangely from across time and space
but i need not warn you that you will share
our punishment if our enterprise fails
you mean that the vramen would kill
us if they caught us hammond asked
curiously

  wilson shook his head

  the vramen hold no official position
their domination is through their scientific
powers and prestige they would turn us
over to the courts of the federated suns
which would be forced to sentence us for
breaking the star-ship laws

  he took kirk hammond through the work-
shops showing him the amazing activity that
was going on hammond learned that all
this labor was powered by atomic turbines
which could supply almost unlimited energy
from the controlled disintegration of metallic
copper in whirl-chambers

  the energy-guns were in effect small gen-
erators capable of ejecting concentrated
streams of protons as the hooman explain-
ed further hammond felt more and more
bewildered by the great advances that had
been made in nearly every field of science

  the ship was being built in small sub-
assemblies metal was secured from deep
workings below the cavern refuge the site
having been chosen for that reason when it
was time to assemble the ship energy-blast-
ers would cut away the walls of the different
chambers and convert it all into one large
underground hangar

  and when the ship is ready to start we
will simply blast away the rock roof and

take off by night jon wilson added

  but wont the vramens radiolocators in
that city rurooma note your departure and
investigate hammond objected

  we plan to sabotage some star-ship due
to start at that time and take off in its
place gurth lund explained the vramen
will suspect nothing until were far out in
interstellar space

  wilsons deep eyes shone

  and then for corvus cluster and the
world althar and the great secret

  hammond met all the members of the
band there were thirty-six men and thir-
teen girls and all of them were technicians
or space-men carefully chosen for a definite
part in the daring project

  beside quobba and tammas there were
four natives of other star-systems-two red-
skinned engineers from betelgeuse a
swarthy little pilot from altair and a hollow-
eyed gray-skinned and gloomy looking al-
golian navigator

  they were interrupted by the hurried
appearance of shawn tammas the little
mizarian had come down from the lookout
above

  quobba is getting worried he reported
theres a vraman ship cruising overhead
which he thinks may suspect our location

  jon wilsons gaunt face showed instant
anxiety

  i dont see how they could but ill go
up

  he and gurth lund started up the spiral
stair with tammas kirk hammond and iva
followed them the hoomen had stopped
their work on hearing the alarming report
and were standing about in anxious waiting
groups in the camouflaged lookout-post
inside the fake boulder were rab quobba
and another hooman

  take a look at the way that cursed ship
keeps circling over this region the big blue
vegan asked jon wilson

  wilson applied his eye to one of the clever-
ly concealed loopholes hammond peered
from a similar tiny aperture

  it was a bright sunny morning out on the
rocky coast he could see blue waves dash-
ing against the distant beach then he saw
the vraman ship

tt was a long shimmering torpedo of
transparent substance that cruised in
tightening circles at an altitude of a few
hundred feet
the star of life	

  they surely cant have found our refuge
jon wilson murmured worriedly their
spy-rays wouldns penetrate our shield

 spy-rays repeated hammond question-
ingly and iva explained

 they are rays near the gamma rays in
frequency that can penetrate most sub-
stances theyre projected through solid mat-
ter and a special transformer converts them
into light-waves so you can see by them

  our whole underground refuge is shielded
by a buried plate of alloy impenetrable to
spy-rays jon wilson added and yet-

 kirk hammond saw the reason for the
hooman leaders worry that vraman cruis-
er was circling closer and closer above them

 finally the cruiser poised motionless in
midair only a few hundred feet above their
masked lookout-post

 no doubt about it-theyve somehow
spotted our location cried jon wilson
weve got to bring that cruiser down be-
fore it calls other vramen here

 big rab quobbas massive face flamed
with excitement

  ill bring it down swing aside the ceiling
tammas

 with monkey-like quickness the wizened
little mizarian swung to one side the movable
section in the roof of the fake boulder
quobba was already at the breech of the
big energy-gun he jabbed switches and a
low powerful drone came from its bulbous
base

 the vegan sighted swiftly presesed a
button from the flared muzzle of the heavy
instrument leaped upward a flash like a
cracking bolt of lightning

 got him yelled quobba fierce excite-
ment on his blue face

 the flash had hit the prow of the little
vraman cruiser and it was plunging head-
long toward the ground it fell a hundred
yards from the lookout

  quick weve got to destroy all trace of
that ship before others come and find it
exclaimed jon wilson

 he thrust open the concealed door in the
side of the lookout and plunged out into the
sunlight with lund and rab quobba kirk
hammond ran out with them

 kirk come back theres danger he
heard iva wilson call anxiously

 hammond plunging forward after the
others saw that the whole front part of the
transparent torpedo-shaped cruiser was a
twisted wreck in the wreckage were pinned

the lifeless bodies of two of the ships three

occupants

the third vraman occupant of the cruis-
er was stirring dazedly on its floor as
hammond and the three hoomen reached
the wreck and hastily pried open its sprung

door

  its thayn marden one of the highest of
the vramen here yelled gurth lund in
sudden excitement

  capture her dont kill her cried wilson
taking her prisoner would vastly aid our
plans

  kirk hammond was almost frozen with
astonishment as he saw through the half-
opened door that the surviving vraman was
a girl she was like no girl he had ever
seen before her slim shapely body clothed
only in silken white shorts and sleeveless
shirt seemed to glow all over with a faint
pearly luminescence

  the same faint light shone from her
breathtakingly beautiful white face even
her ashen blond hair scintillated with a like
mysterious brilliance wide blue eyes still
stunned by shock looked up at the hoomen
and hammond as they forced their way into
the ship the vraman girl seemed instantly
to realize that she was trapped in the wreck

  she sprang toward a locker in the wall of
the wreck grabbing for something inside it

  dont let her get hold of their weapons
or were done for yelled lund

  the door gave way before them kirk
hammond was the first one in

  he dived toward the girl in a tackle that
threw her away from the locker she fought
him with incredible wildcat strength

           chapter vi
           vraman girl

unexpected strength in the girls
supple body so surprised hammond
that she almost succeeded in breaking away
from him thayn mardens perfumed blond
hair pressed against his face as he grappled
with her but in the next moment gurth
lund and quobba had grabbed her also

  tie her hands jon wilson ordered ham-
mond hastily quick before other vraman
ships come

  hammond tore a cable loose from the
	startling stories

wreckage inside the ship and used the in-
sulated wire to pinion thayns wrists the
vraman girls blue eyes blazed lightnings
of indignation and wrath at him

  take her to the lookout-gurth and i
will fuse the power-chambers to destroy the
wreck wilson told quobba and hammond

  rab quobba picked up the captive girl
like a child and carried her hastily out of
the wreck with hammond following when
they entered the fake boulder with their
captive iva wilson looked at her in thunder-
struck astonishment

  thayn marden breathed the dark hoo-
man girl this is the first time that one of
the vramen has ever been captive of the
hoomen

  thayn stood her slim body arrowstraight
and her blue eyes flaming from her dead-
white face as she confronted them

  you are outlaws and fugitives and now
you have dared to attack and kill vramen
she accused her voice silvery and wrathful

  there goes the wreck exclaimed little
shawn tammas hopping gleefully with
excitement

  jon wilson and lund had run out of the
wrecked cruiser and taken shelter behind a
massive boulder some distance away

  hammond saw the wreck suddenly en-
veloped by a dazzling explosion as its power-
chambers were somehow short-circuited to
cause an uncontrolled release of atomic force

  when his dazzled eyes regained vision the
wreck was totally gone and there was a big
blackened crater in the sand wilson and the
other hoomen hastily smoothed fresh sand
over the scorched spot then smoothing away
all footprints behind them they hurried back
into the shelter of the lookout

  jon wilsons deep eyes surveyed the cap-
tive vraman girl

  how did you locate our refuge when it is
shielded from your spy-rays

  thayn marden looked at him in silence
with a calm more ominous than her former
wrath her blue eyes had the cold half-
pitying contempt of a goddess looking at
foolish mortals

  is it possible that the very fact your
caverns are impenetrable to spy-rays would
arouse her suspicion asked kirk hammond

  the vraman girl started imperceptibly and
glanced at him as she surveyed his dark
lean face and his different clothing there was
a flicker of surprise and wonder in thayns
eyes

  wilson had not missed her slight start

  i believe you have guessed it hammond
the fact of an underground area completely
impenetrable to spy-rays must have given her
the clue

  but we arranged our ray-shields to make
it seem that it was only a natural deposit of
ray-resistant metals protested gurth luna
it would have seemed so to most vramen
muttered wilson but thayn marden is
one of the highest vramen scientists in this
solar system remember she guessed the
truth where another would not have
thayn spoke curtly

  others will come to search and will finally
guess your refuge too

  theyre not all as clever as you jon wil-
son reminded and dont forget that we now
hold you thayn

  the hatred in wilsons deep eyes and voice
came from depths of passion the age-old re-
resentment of the hoomen against this caste
of immortal scientists and that same bitter
feeling was mirrored in the faces of the
others

leaving tammas and another man on
guard in the lookout they went down
with their prisoner into the underground
halls and here kirk hammond saw the
blazing excitement of the other hoomen at
this capture they gathered around gazing
in mixed awe and hatred at the vraman girl

  thayn was taken into the little chamber
from which jon wilson directed the work of
his band her cool blue eyes had missed no
detail of the machines and labor in the big
workshop rooms they had come through
and the astronomical charts upon the wall
here gave her more clues

  so this is why you fled from rurooma and
hid here she said you are attempting to
build an illegal star-ship

  we are and our attempt will succeed
replied gurth lund

  then yours was the unauthorized craft
that our radiolocators showed approaching
earth four nights ago

  jon wilson gestured toward hammond
no that was his ship his name is kirk
hammond and he came from ten thousand
years in the past to join us

  thayns blue eyes widened a little as she
looked at hammond

  from the past it cannot be and yet his
look and speech-

  it is true iva said triumphantly his
the star of life	

ship took off from this earth a hundred cen-
turies ago all those centuries he lay in
frozen sleep in space but awoke when his
ship fell back to earth

  the startled gaze of the beautiful vraman
girl searched hammonds face

 then you come from an age so remote
that even we vramen know little about it
you are no hooman

  im with the hoomen in their fight for
justice kirk hammond said bluntly

 what do you mean by justice thayn
demanded quickly

  jon wilson spoke solemnly

  we are building a star-ship that will take
us to the one world in the galaxy where you
have forbidden hoomen to go-to althar
and on althar we are going to secure the
secret of immortality which you vramen have
always hoarded for yourselves gurth lund
broke in fiercely and then we hoomen will
shake off your domination forever

  for a moment a shadow of something like
horror showed in thayn mai dens blue eyes

  to althar but you cannot go there you
dare not then her wrath blazed no you
dare not it would violate the pledge made
to the vramen by your government and
even if you dared break that pledge you
could never reach althar

 cant we mocked gurth lund you
forget that the ship we are building will not
have your devilish device of destruction built
into it

  the vramen have other scientific safe-
guards to protect althar and you will never
pass them even should you win through the
perils of that dangerous star-cluster thayn
replied

  that said jon wilson meaningly is why
i wanted to take you prisoner you know all
about the approaches to althar you are go-
ing to tell us about them and how to over-
come those obstacles

  thayns blue eyes flashed lightning

  you dont think id ever tell you that
you should know the vramen better
wilsons gaunt face became somber

it would be better for you to tell of your
free will than to force us to extract the in-
formation from you with a brain-reader
the vraman girl looked at him steadily
that is a mere threat you do not have
one of those instruments here

 we could improvise one wilson re-
torted among us are scientists of many
fields and two of us have had some ex-

perience as psycho-technicians

  they could construct a makeshift brain-
reader the danger is that such an im-
provised instrument would wreck your mind
in the process of extracting information

irk hammond despite his hatred of
all that vraman girl represented
felt a dim horror at the implications of the
threat

  you mean that you could actually extort
knowledge from her mind by means of a
mechanical instrument he asked

  jon wilson nodded

  yes by means of the brain-reader which
scans the neurone synaptic patterns of the
cortex and translates them

  i say do it at once exclaimed gurth
lund passionately his bleak eyes flaring with
that hatred of the vramen which seemed
bitterest in him of all the band what if it
does wreck her mind in the process

  we can commit no such action unless she
forces us to jon wilson replied well
thayn

  you might destroy my mind by your
clumsy attempt but you would learn noth-
ing the vraman girl retorted unyieldingly

  why the very invention of the brain-
reader was one of the gifts of us vramen to
your scientists she added bitterly you
can not frighten me with that

  well give you a day in which to realize
the futility of refusal wilson told her then
we must make the attempt if you still refuse
to tell us about althar

  thayn maiden faced him steadily

  i will tell you but one thing about althar
try to go to that forbidden world and instead
of immortality you will find only a dreadful
fate

  quobba lock her in the small empty
storeroom at the end of the north corridor
ordered wilson set a guard outside the
door

  kirk hammond felt oppression as he
watched the slim figure of the vraman girl
led away in the shadowy corridor the un-
canny luminescence of her body was again
faintly visible

  wilson seeing the trouble on hammonds
face told him reassuringly she will surely
yield her information when she realizes that
we can secure it anyway by reading her
brain

  i hope so hammond muttered it would
be ghastly to risk destroying her mind
	startling stories

  when wilson and gurth lund had gone out
into the big workship halls to tell the excited
hoomen what events portended iva looked
challengingly at kirk hammond

  is it because thayn is beautiful that you
become suddenly so solicitous about her
she demanded

  hammond flushed a little guiltily

  thats a lot of nonsense iva

  she is a beautiful witch without a soul
warned iva passionately the vramen are
all so do not be deceived by her beauty
kirk hammond suddenly grinned down at
the black-haired hooman girl whose dark
face was flushed vividly by her strong
emotion

  why iva you sound a little jealous he
teased

  jealous youre mad kirk flashed iva
your wits must still be numb from your
long sleep to think that

  but there was a hint of angry tears in her
eyes as she turned sharply away from him
hammond amazed swore softly to himself

  just before darkness fell upon the upper
world shawn tammas was relieved and
came down from his hours in the lookout with
disquieting information

  two other vraman ships went up the
coast an hour ago and then came back
theyve missed thayns craft as we
expected

  they have no reason to suspect this
particular spot jon wilson declared but
none of us for any reason must now venture
out onto the surface

  they were retiring later for the nights
sleep-period most of the hoomen having al-
ready done so when big rab quobba ap-
peared in considerable excitement

  i took food and drink to thayn and she
told me that she might give us information
about althar but only in exchange for cer-
tain information from hammond

  from me hammond repeated aston-
ished what could i know that she wants
to learn

  thayn is deeply interested in the fact that
you come from the far past said the vegan
even the vramen know little of that age
gurth lund looked suspicious

  its merely an attempt on her part to
gain time

  perhaps not said jon wilson thought-
fully at least it can do no harm for ham-
mond to question her she might really tell
him something

  kirk hammond started to follow quobba
iva her face troubled called after him
remember what i told you kirk

  at the door to thayns prison a hooman
with an energy-pistol in his belt stood guard
rab quobba gave him careful instructions

  you will let hammond return from the
room when he wishes but make certain that
the vraman girl does not get out
hammond was let into the small rock
chamber and heard the door instantly locked
after him by the guard

           chapter vii
           weird attack

thayn marden faced him from across
the room in the dusk of the place the
strange faint pearly luminescence of her
white body glowed more strongly

  her blue eyes mocked him

  you need not be afraid of me kirk ham-
mond after all i am only a helpless girl
you look about as helpless as a caged
wildcat hammond said bluntly

  thayn uttered a low silvery laugh

  i am not like the women of your past
age

  ill say youre not he retorted women
didnt live forever in my time

  she shrugged shapely bare shoulders
not forever i am less than four hundred
years old

  practically a babe in arms hammond
said dryly then he asked fascinated how
do you vramen do it thayn does that queer
shining of your body have anything to do
with your immortality

  the girls beautiful face hardened slightly
i cannot tell you that that secret is not
for hoomen

  because you vramen know that if the rest
of humanity became immortal you would
lose your dominating position he accused
she shook her head

  that is not the reason the reason is that
immortality is a dreadful burden and the
hoomen will be far happier without it
that said kirk hammond skeptically
is the same kind of high-sounding talk al-
ways handed out by a little oligarchy to
justify its dominance well the power your
immortality gives you wil be broken when we
secure the secret of that immortality for all
the star of life	si

men on althar

  you will never reach althar and even if
you did you would only meet a doom whose
horror you cannot dream thayn said som-
berly

  she changed the subjct to ask tell me
kirk hammond is it true that you come from
the remote past

  its true enough though i can hardly
blame you if you dont believe it

  thayns eyes inspected him musingly

  i can almost believe it for you speak and
look as no hooman of today does and if it
is so you come from a time of which even
we vramen know little for its records were
destroyed in the early interplanetary wars

  what was it like that time ten thousand
years ago what was the earth like then
sudden unexpected homesickness for his
own time swept kirk hammond at the ques-
tion the strangeness of this far future world
was abruptly again overwhelming and he felt
a deep and futile nostalgia

  it wasnt a perfect world by any means
but it was mine he muttered my own
people my own friends-

  and a girl you loved persisted thayn
curiously despite his gesture of denial she
went on was she as beautiful as i am
she had come closer to hammond was
looking up at him with tip-tilted white face
provocative in mock-innocence her blue eyes
soft the subtle perfume of her glimmering
blond hair made his pulses pound

  sharp alarm sounded in hammonds brain
as he suddenly realized that she was tempt-
ing him and was doing a remarkably good
job at it her red lips were close her small
hands grasped his shoulder

 was she kirk hammond whispered
thayn

  not if the sky had thundered could kirk
hammond have refrained from the kiss she
invited her half-parted lips were strangely
cool and sweet and her supple glowing body
was firm and elastic in his grasp he felt his
senses reel

  thayns hands had slipped up his shoulders
to his neck suddenly unexpectedly her
thumbs dug deeply into the nerves at the base
of his neck hammond was paralyzed by a
blinding shock of pain he would have cried
out if he had been able to open his mouth
but couldnt

suddenly every muscle in his body
seemed frozen in icy agony by that

scientifically skillful nerve-pressure the
vraman girl had suddenly applied

  only a trick raged hammonds thought
and you fell for it-

 thayn marden her eyes flashing was
pushing him toward the door of the room
hammond could not resist could not speak
frozen by agony

 the vraman girl reached past him
knocked sharply on the door and concealed
herself behind kirk hammonds swaying up-
right figure

 the door was cautiously opened by the
hooman guard his energy-pistol in his hand
seeing hammond before him the guard re-
laxed a little and started to stand aside

  thayn marden acted with wildcat swift-
ness her hand darted around hammond and
snatched the energy-pistol from the hoo-
mans hand she did not fire the weapon
she brought its butt down on the hoomans
head in a lightning blow before he could
cry out the guard sank to the floor and
thayn darted past him down the corridor

  kirk hammond deprived of her support
crashed to the floor himself he was still a
living log his nerves paralyzed by her scien-
tific pressure but his mind was seething with
rage and shame

  he was guilty of thayns escape she had
used the oldest trick in the world to gain an
opportunity for that stunning attack and
like a fool he had fallen for it

  but even though out of her prison surely
the vraman girl couldnt escape to the sur-
face she couldnt get past the hooman
guards up in the lookout-post without caus-
ing a general alarm that would quickly re-
sult in her recapture if he could only cry
out-

 hammond tried to shout and couldnt
every nerve in his body was still numb his
muscles refused to obey his brain he lay
there beside the unconscious guard suffer-
ing tortures of self-accusation as the minutes
passed the cavern-world remained silent
sleeping

  at last it seemed to him that a faint glow
of feeling was coming back into his nerves
with desperate hope he tried to move and
found himself stirring feebly he got to his
knees then uttered a hoarse cry that re-
verberated down the corridor

  quobba wilson he husked tripping and
stumbling as he tried to gain his feet

  he heard alarmed voices hurrying foot-
steps rab quobba and jon wilson and
	startling stories

others burst out of their sleeping-chambers

the prison-room is empty-thayns
gone exclaimed the big vegan stupefied

  gurth lund swung savagely on kirk ham-
mond whipping out an energy-pistol

  you helped her escape youre a vraman
spy as i thought from the first

  no hammond denied hoarsely she
tricked me i admit but i didnt mean-

he broke off pointed down the corridor

  shes still somewhere down here theres
 been no alarm from the lookout-post

  the hoomen sprang forward hammond
followed them unsteadily through the lighted
rock halls to the big workshop

  lund shouted fiercely thayn was across
the big room bent over one of the tables of
apparatus her weapon had been laid aside
on the table she had apparently been work-
ing with superhuman speed for on the table
was droning one of the small electric genera-
tors whose wiring had been altered

  she swung around as lund and jon wilson
and the others burst into the hall lunds
energy-pistol covered her thayn merely
smiled calmly and did not try to reach for
her own weapon

  turn off that generator cried jon wil-
 son his face alarmed shes been doing
 something with it

shawn tammas darted forward and
tore the wires away and the apparatus
stopped its drone

  thayn laughed

  too late hooman for the last few min-
utes it has been broadcasting an electro-
magnetic beam of frequency that can pene-
trate even your spy-ray shields

  that beam will have registered on the
instruments of the vraman ships searching
this coast she added coolly theyll be
here almost at once

  gurth lund raised his pistol a little his
 square face dark and deadly

  i warn you that if you kill me it will only
 increase the punishment that is now inevita-
 ble for you all thayn said quietly

  nevertheless youre going to die hissed
 lund and your spy and helper is going to
 die with you

  his weapon swung slightly as he stepped
back a little to bring kirk hammond also
within line of its blast

iva wilson ran forward with a sharp cry

  you cant do that gurth kirk did not
mean to help her

  youre in love with him but that wont
save him raged lund he has betrayed
the hopes of the whole hooman race

  in kirk hammonds numbed brain a clear
cold voice seemed suddenly to speak it was
like that strange mental voice which had at-
tacked him hypnotically on the night when he
and quobba had crouched beneath the
searching firefly ships

  put down all your weapons commanded
that chill mental voice

  lunds energy-pistol clattered to the floor
as did the weapons of quobba and jon wil-
son and the others hammond looked wildly
upward down the spiral stair from the
lookout post a half-dozen men were coming
they carried an object like a big searchlight
from it sprang a broad fan of pale green
force that enveloped every hooman in the
rock hall

  it was the weapon of hypnotic attack and
neither he nor the hooman were wearing the
protective turbans now

  the men who carried that strange weapon
were subtly alien their calm faces and
superb bodies had the same faint pearly
luminescence that shimmered from thayns
supple figure

 the vramen groaned jon wilson
theyve already overpowered the lookout
guards and-

  kirk hammond standing with the stricken
hoomen heard another cold hynotic com-
mand inside his mind

  sleep now it came authoritatively
sleep

  the hoomen were already sinking to the
floor around him darkness swept over ham-
monds brain

chapter viii

in rurooma

it was with an unusual sensation of
strength and vigor that hammond
awoke for the first time since his strange
resurrection in this future world he did not
feel dragging weakness rarely indeed had
he ever felt so well

  he lay upon a soft low couch at its foot
stood an apparatus like a tall lamp whose
violent light had played upon his body as he
slept was it that which had washed away
his former weakness
the star of life	

 kirk hammonds eyes dazedly took in the
small room its floor ceiling and three of the
walls were of a substance that looked like
green porcelain the fourth wall a slightly
curving one was perfectly transparent and
admitted a flood of bright sunlight

 good heavens hammond exclaimed as
memory suddenly rushed over him the
vramen

 he remembered everything now-his folly
thayns escape and the vramen who had
answered her signal and had overpowered
all the hoomen in the underground refuge
with their uncanny hypnotic weapon

 hammond got to his feet and went to the
single door of the room it was locked and
hammering upon it produced no impression
baffled he went to that transparent wall
which was a single big window

 he looked forth stunned he was high
above a city and it was such a city as
neither kirk hammond nor any other man
of his time had ever seen before it was no
vast huddled metropolis of planless struc-
tures there were no more than a hundred
buildings in the city but they were the
buildings of giants colossal pylons each al-
most a mile in height

 each of the gigantic pylons looked like an
erect bundle of round glass rods the cross-
section was such hammond guessed as to
admit maximum sunlight to the interiors
flashing and glittering in the sunshine with
torpedo-shaped fliers flitting over their
cloud-high tips they were mind-rocking

 the city rurooma kirk hammond whis-
pered rurooma as the hoomen described
it and that means-

 his presence here meant tragedy it meant
that he and all his hoomen friends over-
powered by the vramen had been brought
here to be punished for their conspiracy

 hamomnd felt the anguish of guilt it was
a bitter irony that he who had sympathized
so deeply with the hoomens aspirations
should have been the one to bring ruin to
their hopes where were jon wilson and
iva and the others now

 he swung around sharply as the door
opened anger fired his brain as he saw
thayn marden enter he advanced toward
her his hands clenched

 thayn spoke a calm warning displaying
a silver pencil-like tube she held

 i can shock you unconscious with this if
you force me to

 hammond stopped shaking with rage yet

even in his fury he admitted to himself that
the vramen girl was more beautiful than
ever

 thayn now wore black silky shirt and
shorts that made the loveliness of her supple
white body transcendent on her shoulder
was an odd badge of glittering gems and a
jewelled band confined her blond hair her
face was quite calm her blue eyes inspected
hammond gravely

  what have you done with jon wilson and
quobba and the others kirk hammond de-
manded savagely

  thayn answered unhesitatingly

  they are in this building like you they
have been kept here the last two days await-
ing trial

  two days hammond repeated for the
moment astonished out of his anger do
you mean that ive been here that long

 thayn nodded

 when we examined you we found your
body still suffering from that long frozen
sleep in space it was deemed wise to keep
you under revivifying radiation during this

time

 kirk hammonds mind reverted to her
statement about his friends

  you say wilson and the others are all
right how do i know youre not lying

 we vramen are truth-seekers we are
not in the habit of lying thayn marden
answered coldly

  i suppose it was not a lying trick that you
used on me to win your escape

he girl shrugged shapely shoulders
that was a case of extreme emergen-
cy any subterfuge is excusable to prevent
the hoomen from learning the secret of our
immortality

  no real woman would use a subterfuge
like that hammond said savagely but it
would come naturally enough to a four-
hundred-year-old creature like a vraman

girl

  he wanted fiercely to hurt her and he suc-
ceeded for this time something in his words
struck home

 thayn winced and when after a moment
she spoke her voice was dull with pain

  you have a right to say that to me she
said looking at him steadily but now will
you hear why i have come

  to tell me that im to be tried and pun-
ished with the others retorted hammond
all right im perfectly ready
	startling stories

  you will not receive punishment unless
you prove utterly intractable thayn told
him

  we know now that your story of coming
from the remote past is wholly true she
continued rapidly for we have succeeded
in raising your little rocket-ship from the
sea

  we of the vramen live primarily to en-
large scientific knowledge you can add
greatly to our knowledge of the past for as
i told you the records of your pre-planetary
civilization were mostly destroyed by the
great wars between earth mars and venus
in the twenty-fifth century

  if you will agree to assist our researches
in every way possible to answer all our
questions and submit to our psycho-testers
we will ask the hoomens court to suspend
sentence upon you for your part in the con-
spiracy

  ill make no such bargain hammond
answered smolderingly im against your
little caste of supermen who dominate the
whole race and i stick with wilson and my
friends

  that is because you do not truly know the
truth thayn persisted we vramen
exercise leadership only because our vastly
longer lives give us power to see and guide
humanity down the right paths

  if you only want to help humanity then
why dont you let them all become immortal
like yourselves hammond demanded un-
believingly

  thayn marden looked a little weary

  i see that you will not listen to reason
the others have infected you with their
prejudices and you bitterly resent my trick
because you are in love with me

  in love with you you must be a little
crazy to think that retorted hammond

  thayn smiled mockigly

  while you lay sleeping a brain-reader
was used upon you as upon the other
prisoners to secure evidence for your trial
i was permitted to see the records

  they show that you have been in love
with me from the moment you saw me even
though you try to crowd the fact down into
your subconscious

  she went out locking the door after her
and leaving kirk hammond with his angry
reply unuttered

  in love with that cold-blooded vraman
girl that was how much their mind-reading
was worth he thought furiously he had felt

a momentary physical attraction for her and
theyd mistaken that as love

  an hour later the door was opened and two
men entered they were clean-cut young
hoomen in black uniforms with an emblem
of clustered golden disks on the breast of
each

  both wore energy-pistols

  one spoke quietly to hammond

  we are officers of the federated suns
police we are to take you to your trial

  hammond went out with them into a curv-
ing corridor of cool green glass the material
somehow lighted from within

  in the corridor were other guards and
their two-score and more prisoners-jon
wilsons band

  wilson quobba youre all all right
kirk hammond exclaimed anxiously as he
joined them

jon wilsons reply was a stony silence
gurth lund glared at him and even
rab quobba and little tammas avoided his
gaze

  hammond was stunned by the hostile re-
ception

  why whats the matter

  the guard officer intervened

  you cannot talk here the court is wait-
ing

  they were marched into a small room that
proved to be a lift for it suddenly sank
downward with great speed hammond found
himself beside iva wilson and he spoke to
her in an anxious whisper

  iva they surely dont think yet that i was
a vraman spy if i were would i be a
prisoner too

  iva looked at him unhappily

  gurth and the others say that is only a
trick

  the lift stopped and they were led from
it into a large and austerely beautiful court-
room its floor was a lake of smooth black
the walls just above the floor were dusky
gray and this shaded upward through fighter
and lighter grays to the pure white climax of
the vaulted ceiling

  kirk hammond perceived a dais on which
sat the hooman he assumed to be their judge
below this dais were long seats on one of
which sat thayn marden and several other
vramen

  the cursed vramen are here to see that
the court sentences us properly he heard
rab quobba mutter to tammas
the star

 hundreds of hoomen spectators crowded
the courtroom and a murmur of many voices
came from them as the prisoners walked to
their seats

  that is he the tall dark one the man
from the far past

 hammond suddenly realized that he was
the center of the crowds curiosity ap-
parently news of his incredible advent from
ten thousand years before had spread rapidly
even the hooman judge a keen-eyed middle

of life	

 you would only make new readings
 jon wilson answered sullenly we will not
 protest the brain-records

 the judge looked at thayn

 thayn marden as the person making the
 charge you also have been permitted to
 examine the records do you wish to protest
 any part of them

 i do not challenge anything in those rec-
 ords thayn answered quickly

 it became apparent to kirk hammond

youre the only one in the world who can explain my
luck to me and show me how to use it
-and you better do it

qteve sims former professor of physics looked in amazement at
 lucky connors who had just conked him on the head a few min-
utes before-and was now making this strange demand of him with
the two men was the girl named frances it was a miracle that any of them
were alive

  the terrain around them was utterly dead and completely uninhabitable destroyed a long
time ago by atomic explosives the surface of the ground was melted to a sort of cracked
glassy substance which was highly radioactive only homeless wanderers were alive and
there was little food no means of maintaining life much longer

  in the midst of this devastation it was odd to be questioned about the laws of prob-
ability steve sims had been working on an analysis of the principles of
chance lucky connors was phenomenally lucky could make anything turn
out as he wanted it to-and lucky connors wanted to know why

  follow the exploits of steve sims lucky connors and the girl named
frances in the laws of chance murray leinsters amazing novel
of the atomic age in the next issue of startling stories youll
be startled at the graphic picture of a world in ruins youll be aston-
ished at the new vistas opened by the luck of lucky connors-and steve
sims the laws of chance is a novel of tomorrow-packed with
adventure-that will set you thinking look forward to it

aged earthman looked down at him with
more than usual interest

 over the dais glittered an emblem of
clustered gold disks which hammond was
later to learn was the official insigne of the
federated suns government

  you have been charged with the offense
of secretly building an illegal star-ship the
hooman judge told the prisoners

  he picked up a sheaf of papers

  these are the brain-readers records of
your minds you have had a chance to
examine them do you wish to protest any
part of the records

from the speed with which all this was
carried through that it was a mere legal
formality that no one expected the brain-
records to be challenged

  how could you challenge a precise scien-
tific recording of a mans mind there was
no place in this super-modern court for
lawyers and legal tricks for -lies and denials
and evasions

  the hooman judge was speaking on to the
band of prisoners who faced him

  you well knew that you were breaking
the law of the federated suns government
when you attempted secretly to build an
	startling stories

unauthorized star-ship

  you know that our government pledged
the vramen long ago that no star-ship would
be built without their incorporating into it
their secret device which prevents intruders
from visiting their sanctuary at althar

  we do not recognize that pledge as bind-
ing upon all hoomen jon wilson replied
with harsh passion

  his deep eyes held a bitter light

  why should the vramen hold that power
over all star-ships why should they hoard
the secret of unlimited life while we die after
brief lives why should they dominate all
our race

  there was a low mutter of assent from the
crowd in the courtroom at these defiant
words

it was evident to kirk hammond that
most hoomen felt the same resentment
wilson had just expressed

  the judge glanced nervously at the calm-
faced vramen below his dais as he answered

  the validity of our pledge to the vramen
is not in question here we made the pledge
and we will abide by it by breaking it and
by attempting to foment hostility toward the
vramen you have committed a crime of
state since you can offer no extenuation and
have not protested the brain-records your
guilt is beyond dispute you are sentenced to
ten years on the penal planet of spica

 we expected no other judgment jon
wilson said harshly but a day will come
when hoomen will take the secret of im-
mortality from the vramen and throw off
their dominance of our civilization for good
again that mutter of angry agreement
swept the crowd of spectators it was per-
emptorily silenced by the judge

  our sentence applies to all defendants
except the one named kirk hammond he
said i understand that the vramen repre-
sentatives here wish to ask commutation of
his sentence

  he looked inquiringly at thayn marden
the vraman girl rose and glanced at ham-
monds defiant face as she spoke

  that was our intention thayn said but
the man kirk hammond has utterly refused
to cooperate with us

 the judge looked down at hammond
a little troubled that is unfortunate as a
man cast by miraculous chance from your
past age into our time you would ordinarily

be an admired and honored guest among us

  but you have by evidence of your brain-
record conspired with these others in full
knowledge that you were breaking our laws
the exceptional circumstances of your per-
sonal history cannot justify overlooking your
deliberate infraction of the law of the feder-
ated suns only if the vramens representa-
tives request it can i suspend your sentence
we are still quite willing to make the
request if the man hammond will agree to
assist our researches said thayn calmly

  all of kirk hammonds smoldering resent-
ment toward the beautiful vraman girl
flared into his hot reply

  ill see you in blazes before i make any
agreement with the little bunch of self-styled
supermen who run things here

  then you must serve your sentence on
kuum the penal planet of spica said the
judge you will not be released unless you
change your mind and agree to do as the
vramen ask

           chapter ix
           prison planet

racing droning quivering the blunt-
nosed star-ship rushed into the black
gulf of interstellar space at a speed that could
only be measured in many multiples of the
velocity of light

  from a porthole window in the main
prisoners cabin kirk hammond looked back
but he could see nothing of the receding
earth and sun but a twisted blur of light
rays in which they wavered like ghosts

  iva wilson spoke at his shoulder

  theres no use looking back the space-
split prevents you from seeing anything be-
hind clearly

  the space-split thats what drives the
ship

  hammond was still a little overwhelmed
by the swiftness of the transition to space
they had been marched from the courtroom
to an underground tubeway that took them
swiftly to the great spaceport east of
rurooma

  that spaceport had been stunning enough
with its dozens of large oval star-ships its
terminals and docks thronged with a cosmo-
politan throng that represented nearly every
the star

hooman star-folk in the galaxy

  the had been marched into the black police
ship with the emblem of the federated suns
on its bows down to this lower prison-deck
sealed off from the rest of the ship then they
had taken off

 utterly different from his own wild and
hazardous take-off in his rocket long ago
had been this start generators in the ship
had droned loud there had been a sudden
sense of weight as they sat in the recoil-
chairs and then this fantastic blur of space
falling astern

  to jon wilson and the others all this was
not startling they were star-ship men most
of them-accustomed to coming and going
across the galactic spaces but to hammond
it was unreal uncanny

  the blurred ghost-sun and spectral planets
dwindled rapidly behind them the drone of
generators rose ever higher as the ship flung
through space at speeds hammond could not
even guess

  how can a ship split the space it travels
through he asked iva puzzledly

  the girls clear brow wrinkled

  im not much of a technician kirk but
suppose you have a boat going through water

if you could split the water just ahead of the
boat by some means you could drive it far
faster couldnt you as fast as a plane
even

  its that way in space space is a three-

of life



dimensional continuum relativity proved
long ago that space can expand can be
strained can be warped apply enough
warping force and it can be split wide open
relative to the fourth spatial dimension

  thats what the generators of a star-ship
do they fling ahead twin fields of opposing
force that set up such a terrific strain on the
continuum that it perpetually splits open
right in front of the ship thus in a way the
ship goes around space instead of through it

  hammond shook his head

  its just as well youre not more of a
technician i can grasp the principle but the
details would floor me

  jon wilson and gurth lund and the others
looked at hammond without friendliness as
he turned from the port and approached
them

  hammond spoke earnestly

  i know its my fault were all here for
letting thayn marden escape i wish i could
undo it but i cant

  rab quobba got to his feet

  sure thats what i tell them it was just
bad luck youre not to blame

 gurth lund looked at hammond with
bleak bitter eyes

  not to blame if he hadnt been a blind
fool-

 but he was-young men always are
cackled little shawn tammas grinning all
across his wizened face

kirk hammond looked at jon wilson
the hooman leaders gaunt face had
not softened

  i could forgive a blunder even though it
has ruined all our hopes wilson said rasp-
ingly but i am not sure but that you let
thayn marden escape deliberately

  father you know thats not so pro-
tested iva

  if id done that why would i refuse to
help the vramen when it would have secured
my freedom hammond demanded hotly

  that said wilson slowly is what i
would like to know it could be a trick on the
part of the vramen to send you along with
us for the time being as a spy

  kirk hammond could not believe his ears
the hooman leader had always seemed to
him a fair-minded man

  youve not one scrap of proof of such a
charge he said angrily

  yes i have jon wilson answered stern-
ly as leader of the accused i was allowed
to examine the brain-records made before
our trial so that i might exercise my legal
right of protesting them if i wished
quobba and lund and the others looked
puzzled but hammond knew with a sud-
den sinking sensation what was coming

  i found in hammonds brain-record clear
indication that he was in love with thayn
marden

  a roar of anger burst from the prisoners
they leaped to their feet and gurth lund
advanced on hammond his square face
deadly

  i knew it from the first raged lund
i should have killed him when i had the
chance but its not too late-

  he charged at hammond surprised by the
sudden fierce attack kirk hammond failed
to dodge the others swinging fists he went
down from a stunning blow gurth lunds
hands gripped his throat and the hoomans
eyes glared down into his as he throttled him

  with a savage effort hammond doubled
his knees and sent lund reeling back off him
lund gathered himself to renew the attack
but jon wilson grasped him held him back

  no gurth youll only bring the guards
down here and cause us all to be locked into
our cabins

  lunds right growled one of the scowl-
ing hoomen we ought to kill him

  it would cause our sentences on kuum to
be lengthened to life wilson said forcefully
i say no

 kirk hammond had got to his feet he
ignored the raging lund and addressed him-
self to the leader

  wilson i swear im on your side i admit
i was stupid to let thayn trick me that night
but it was stupidity and not treachery

  jon wilson eyed him harshly

 it may be as you say but we can no
longer trust you we can trust no one who
is mad enough to love a vraman

  i tell you i dont love that blasted girl
hammond began angrily

  they didnt listen to him they turned
their backs on him and ignored him com-
pletely in the hours that followed it was a
miserable time for hammond he had no
one to speak to there was not even a guard
for the prison-compartment was entirely
sealed off from the rest of the ship

  their food and drink was sent in to them
through a small conveyor arrangement after
eating the simple meal of synthetic jellies
the hoomen retired to their tiny sleeping-
cabins as a bell signaled the sleep-period

 kirk hammond remained in the main
cabin looking miserably out the port the
ship was still droning its way at unguessable
velocities into the great starry deeps of the
galaxy he could not see spica for the star
of their destination was straight ahead but
he could distinguish vega and fomalhaut
and altair strung across the heavens amid
the hosts of lesser stars

e had dreamed long ago that men
might conquer the stars though he had
never thought that he himself would see it
and now he was going out into those galactic
mysteries but there was no thrill in it in his
present situation

  ostracised by the only friends i had in
this age hammond thought dismally
hated and distrusted by the hoomen i
wanted to help-

  he felt an angry reaction that made him
momentarily wish that he had accepted the
vramens offer but that passed quickly he
couldnt have done it he sympathized too
strongly with the hoomen in their fight
against the vraman injustice their struggle
to win the great secret for their people

  he turned suddenly at a step behind him
it was iva wilson and her dark pretty face
was unhappy as she looked at hammond

  kirk im sorry about what happened
but i didnt dare speak to you before the
others
the star of life	

he looked at her

iva you dont believe that i was guilty of
any treachery

of course not she said quickly it was
just thayn mardens devilish tricks is it
true that youre in love with her kirk

of course not he exploded ill admit
i was a little attracted when she deliberately
tempted me what man wouldnt be and
that got into my brain-record and they
thought it meant i loved her who could
love a cold-blooded ice-hard person like
that

iva looked relieved

i was sure it must be so for a hooman to
love a vraman is too impossible

why is it he asked dont any of the
vramen ever marry hoomen

the vramen never marry at all iva told
him they forswear love and marriage when
they become immortal and become just cold
unhuman thinking-machines

kirk she went on the others will come
around in time when they realize youre no
traitor well be on kuum a long time and
theyll have time to think

i hope so hammond said dubiously
but i cant figure gurth lund ever warm-
ing up to me why does he hate me so

it is the vramen he hates very bitterly
iva said you see the girl gurth loved died
of illness a few years ago he brooded upon
the fact that if the hoomen had had the
secret of life she would not have died that
is what made him so bitter

my father is the same she added it
was my mothers death that made him so
fiercely determined to win the secret of un-
ending life for the hoomen

she pointed to a misty-looking star that
shone amid the hosts of sparkling suns ahead

how would you feel if you saw the person
you most loved dying and knew there was a
secret of life there that would prevent it
hammond stared at the misty star

thats where althar is then

iva nodded soberly that is corvus
cluster and deep within its mazes lies
mysterious althar and its secret

kirk hammond could now understand
lunds bitterness and jon wilsons fierce
rebellious determination

poor chaps no wonder they hate the
vramen for denying them the secret that
would have meant so much

he gripped ivas small hand

i wont let their attitude toward me

change me iva im still heart and soul with
your people and somehow well yet find a
way to wrest that secret from the vramen
and end their domination

  the girl shook her dark head doubtfully

  i pray that it may be so but i fear that
there is no hope once we are on kuum

he turned away

  i must go back to my cabin before the
others see me here my father would not
allow me to speak with you

  her hand was still in hammonds on sud-
den impulse he bent and kissed her shy
pretty face

  the touch of her lips was warm and eager
and dear and yet-what devil put the
thought into his head-it was not the elec-
tric thrill that had been in thayn mardens
cool lips

  kirk hammond kept his resolve and deter-
minedly overlooked the hostility of his fellow
prisoners during the next days sooner or
later they would get over their distrust of
him and then he could plan with them to
carry on the struggle to which he had dedi-
cated himself

  seven sleep-periods went by and the whole
aspect of the constellations had changed that
was proof of the tremendous speed with
which the space-split drive hurled the police
ship through the galaxy

  hammond felt wonder at the realization
that hosts of other ships were speeding
through that vast starry space to smoky red
antares and dim algol and green sirius he
was overwhelmed by the vastness of the
galactic civilization that had been built up
in ten thousand years

  on the eighth day the ship veered to dis-
close the blazing white globe of spica straight
ahead the unearthly velocities of the drive
had taken them across scores of parsecs and
they were approaching their destination

  the droning generators changed in key
dropping down the scale as the ship curved
in through the dazzling white glare of spica
the great white sun had but one planet
kuum that worlds lonely isolation here
was why it had been chosen to serve as a
penal planet

 kuum was a black-and-white world no
larger than earth it had small milky-white
oceans and continents covered with rolling
blue-black jungle that was broken only by
little clearings of pale gray grass

  there was one large cleared region scores
	startling stories

of miles across surrounded by the dark
jungle this space held cultivated fields and
a small town of metal houses with a compact
spaceport near it

  so this is kuum rumbled big rab
quobba his massive blue face disgusted as
he stared down its one of the few worlds
i never visited or wanted to visit

  jon wilsons gaunt face was deeply dis-
couraged

  now i can see why nobody in all history
has ever escaped this prison planet

chapter x
star-mens hatred

easily the star-ship sank toward the
little spaceport and landed on a tarmac
that bore no other ships presently the
prisoners were marched out into the soft
humid warm air and the eye-aching bril-
liance of setting spica

  there rose at the edge of the spaceport a
square towered cement building with the
federated suns emblem on it kirk ham-
mond guessed it to contain the police bar-
racks and offices the building and the whole
spaceport were enclosed by a high shimmer-
ing wall of white light

  theyve certainly got this place well
guarded muttered little shawn tammas
behind hammond look at that force-wall
i see it rumbled quobba a rat
wouldnt have a chance of getting through it
to this spaceport

  hammond gathered that the wall of shim-
mering light was in reality a wall of un-
ceasing atomic force that would blast anyone
who tried to cross it only a few score police
seemed stationed here their commandant
a tall green sirian hooman officer spoke
crisply

  you prisoners wont find your sentence
here too unbearable but you must not try
to leave this world it would be suicide to
attempt it for no star-ship ever lands
here except inside this compound and no
prisoner is permitted to enter this area
except on arriving or departing

  he nodded to a subordinate officer

  take them in and assign them quarters
theyll soon learn the ropes

  they were led toward the shimmering
force-wall their escort made a signal to the

guard in the tower of the police building a
section of the force-wall was turned off they
passed over projectors sunk deep in the
ground from which came the perpetual
atomic blast then the wall came on again
behind them

  and it can only be turned on or off from
that tower inside it muttered tammas
theres no chance of escape here

  kirk hammond had expected the prison
planet to be a grim forbidding place and
the distant jungles still looked dark and
wild but he was amazed by the rest of the
prison settlement before them in the blaz-
ing white sunset lay a neat town of bright
metal cottages and brilliant gardens women
were chatting from door to door and children
played in the streets

  men were trooping in from their days
work in the distant jungle in power-trucks
they were a motley lot from every part of
the galaxy hoomen with red skins white
skins green skins but there was no sullen-
ness about them as they hailed their wives
and children

  it doesnt look like a penal colony at all
hammond exclaimed to the guard-officer
leading them

  the officer looked surprised

  what do you mean what else did you
expect

 hammond began to understand the
galactic civilization of the federated suns
was too modern and advanced to use harsh
punishments such penalties were as out-
moded now as knights in armor this was
more of a detention world than a place of
vengeful punishment

  those among you who are family groups
will be given cottages the officer said the
rest will live in the barracks

  kirk hammond like quobba and lund and
most of the other men was given living
quarters in one of the big shining barracks
buildings

  they were eagerly greeted by the dozens
of other men here hammond was be-
wildered by the motley character of his
fellow prisoners here were gathered law-
breakers from many parts of the galaxy
from vega antares arcturus and many
other stars all were hoomen all spoke the
same language but in color and manner
they differed

  hammond heard gossip of far stars and
galactic ports of which he had never heard
quobba asked for news of his home world at
the star of life	

vega and little shawn tammas retailed the
latest events at sol

but when gurth lund told the reason
for their own imprisonment a surge of
excitement passed through the crowd

  you were trying to reach althar by the
suns i wish youd made it and found the
cursed vramens secret cried a fat pink
antarian

  weve not given up hope yet said gurth
lund tightly

  youd better give it up advised a dark
stocky centaurian for if youre thinking of
escaping from kuum you can forget it

  he explained

  except for ships bringing new prisoners
no craft except a supply-ship each month
comes here and what ships do come stay
inside that walled compound and take off as
soon as unloaded

  kirk hammond had been included in the
general cheerful greeting to the newcomers
had been eagerly questioned about sol and
earth but when he awoke the next morn-
ing he found things changed the other
prisoners in the barracks glared at him and
did not speak thol orr a wrinkled old al-
golian with a wise pallid face was the only
man to speak to hammond

  they say you are a spy of the vramen
he told hammond im afraid youre in for
a rough time here

  hammonds heart sank

  its not true but i suppose theres no way
i can convince them

  thol orr looked at him with deep interest
is it true that you come from the far past
as they say that is hard to believe

 he shook his head when hammond fin-
ished his brief explanation

  truly yours is a wonderful story i want

to hear more of it i shall have you assigned
to my crew in the jungle

  it developed that all work here on kuum
was under the direction of the prisoners
themselves no guards bothered them except
to make short inspection trips through the
settlement each evening

 the federated suns government paid a
fixed wage to the men for clearing away the
jungle that surrounded the settlement they
had power-dozers trucks and other ma-
chinery but nothing that could possibly be
used as weapons

  thol orr was as good as his word and had
hammond assigned to his own jungle-clear-
ing crew they rolled out of the little town
in a power-truck and hammond rode in the
cab with the old algolian

  perhaps youd better ostracise me like the
others or theyll be treating you as a spy
too hammond said bitterly

  thol orr smiled

  i am not afraid of that and i am deeply
interested in your story for i was once a
scientist of some note

 what happened to put you here on
kuum

  the old algolian shrugged

my enthusiasm for research got the best
of me i took a small star-ship and entered
forbidden corvus cluster some years ago
for that offense i was sentenced to kuum
hammonds pulse jumped

  you were in there hunting for althar for
the secret of life

  no not at all denied thol orr i was
a radiation expert and merely wished to
study an unique radiation in that cluster
but of course that did not excuse my break-
ing the law

	startling stories

jungle spica had risen well into the sky and
its white radiance was already very hot
the warm humid air brought a dank mist
from the tenebrous glades of the forest

  hammond had never seen anything like
this black jungle it was like a forest out
of some demoniac painters fevered imagi-
nation a bewildering tangle of glossy black
trees and shrubs whose branches bore great
masses of pale gray leaves there were
looping black vines and enormous pure
white flowers and strange featherless birds
darting to and fro amid the gray fronds

the trees and brush had to be rooted
out with the power-dozers as fast as a
small section was cleared it was plowed
deeply and chemicals were mixed into its
soil which would inhibit the growth of the
rank jungle-plants and would allow gray
grass to spring up instead

  you will handle one of the chains thol
orr told hammond you see we pull the
larger trees out by main force

 kirk hammond found himself working
with the others of the motley little crew un-
der the old algol ians orders

  fasten your chain around that tree-no
lower down thol orr called now stand
clear

  the power-dozer driven by heavy atom-
ics sank its spiked tracks into the ground
and yanked the tree forth bodily flights
of huge insects like giant dragon-flies skit-
tered from its branches as it fell the sun
poured down ever more hotly hammond
soon got the routine of the work but he
quickly found that he still had much to
learn about the jungles of kuum

  crawler-vines writhed down from trees
and looped about his body tiny sucker-
roots fastened onto his arms and face he
tore the uncanny plants loose but a worse
experience was ahead

  late that afternoon hammond was pull-
ing one of the drag-chains into the thick
brush ahead of the crew when he smelled
a peculiarly heavy musky odor next mo-
ment he bumped into a round black mound
higher than his head

  the black mound suddenly came alive it
heaved slightly and from beneath it a huge
horny paw reached out and grasped ham-
mond

  crushed half-stunned he felt himself be-
ing dragged back toward the mound he now
recognized as a giant shelled turtle-like

creature hammond was near the beasts
body when the paw dragging him stopped
it remained clutching him but a sharp trem-
or ran through it and through the whole
huge shelled body

  half conscious unable even to cry for
help in the grip of that enormous paw kirk
hammond gave himself up for lost the
others were out of sight beyond the thick
brush

  to die like this on spicas world after
all i came through he thought wildly in his
darkening brain

  other more violent tremors ran through
the huge headless body of the monster the
grip of the great paw weakened and re-
laxed then hammond saw a sight that
made him doubt his sanity the shell of the
giant black creatures body began to split

  its whole horny carapace and outer body
were splitting wide open literally its body
seemed to fall apart as kirk hammond
staggered to his feet he saw the ghastly and
horrific final phase of the incredible spec-
tacle from out of the split remains of the
monsters body climbed a far smaller crea-
ture of exactly the same species

  thol orr yelled hammond stumbling
dazedly backward

  the old algolian answered that cry by
driving his big power-dozer right through
the brush

 the smaller black monster that had
emerged from the broken body of the larger
scuttled hastily away through the brush

 a mud-phoenix exclaimed thol orr
did it harm you

 kirk hammond hastily related his in-
credible experience the old algolian shook
his head

 you have been extremely lucky you
happened to blunder into the mud-phoenix
at the time of its rebirth and that saved
you

  he explained

  they are a strange species indigenous to
kuum they are sexless and reproduce by
the weird cycle of sudden death and rebirth
you saw and they are dangerous when
large didnt the men warn you that a musky
odor meant that one of them was near

 the men warned me of nothing-theyd
be only too glad to see a vraman spy meet
his death i suppose hammond said bit-
terly

  he knew now that the others had delib-
erately let him walk into the monster it
the star of life	

proved how deep was their hostility toward
him

  their hostility and distrust were further
exemplified when they returned to the pris-
oners town that evening the other men
cheerfully talked over the days work
swarmed off to the little drinking-shops
hailed friends in the dusking streets

kirk hammond was left strictly alone
and got nothing but unfriendly stares
when he ventured forth he finally gave it
up and returned to his little room in the
barracks

  hammond found no change in that attitude
in the days that followed only thol orr
would talk with him all the others had
marked him as a spy in his heart he could
not entirely blame them it was his own
fault for his folly had ruined the plan that
jon wilson and his friends had so cher-
ished he was responsible for their being
here

 and that cursed brain-record made them
think i was in love with thayn marden he
thought if it hadnt been for that-

  he determined that he would live it down
would conquer their distrust and somehow
escape with them to continue the struggle
to unseat the vramens domination

 hammond as the days passed pondered
many plans of escape the great obstacle
was the fact that few star-ships came to
kuum and when they did did not stay long
and they remained inside the force-walled
compound into which prisoners were never
allowed

 finally kirk hammond saw the glimmer-
ings of a plan he thought out every detail of
it there was just a chance it might work

  but its all useless unless the others fol-
low me in the scheme and theyd never
listen to any plan that i proposed

 three weeks of labor in the jungles made
kirk hammond hardy and sunblackened and
grimly accustomed to constant loneliness

 he had learned to drive the power-dozers
and was taking one of them along the edge
of the jungle to where thol orr and his crew
awaited the replacement when he heard a
cry from inside the brush

 mud-phoenix its got-

 the yell was choked off but it had been
enough to make hammond swing his ma-
chine around and hurl it straight into the
forest

  he saw the black monster almost as large

as the one he had himself escaped on his
first day in the jungle it was just drawing
a mans form under it to be ingested into
its strange body

  hammond hurled the heavy dozer right at
the creature the impact sent him flying
from his seat and he crashed into the brush
he got up to find that the collision had killed
the mud-phoenix from beneath its body
was squirming the man it had seized fouled
with mud and slime but unhurt save for
bruises rab quobba looked astonishedly at
hammond

  it was you who knocked out the beast
you saved my life hammond

  the big vegan strode forward gripped his
hand

  ive been a blasted fool

  then you dont believe that im any spy
hammond said

  i never really thought you were but
gurth lund convinced some of us against
our will quobba said ruefully ill never
doubt you again

 thanks quobba kirk hammond said
earnestly and now listen you want to
escape from here and go to althar as we
planned

he vegan stared

 what makes you think we could
we can if jon wilson and his men will all
help they can operate a star-ship if we
seize one but they wont trust me no mat-
ter what you say they would follow you
though

  whats your plan quobba asked quick-
ly

therell be a star-ship coming here soon
hammond said not a supply-ship but an
unusual visit i can make it come you see
he went on to tell the details of his plan
for seizing that star-ship when it came
quobba shook his head

  itll be risky and youll take the biggest
risk but it might work im for trying it
and so will the rest

  then ill start things going this very
evening hammond declared remember
youre to tell the others nothing about me
being in on it just get them ready to follow
you in a break when i give the word

all right quobba nodded but what
youre going to do tonight will make the
others more bitter against you than ever
kirk hammond well realized that him-
self yet he was determined to go through
	startling stories

with the initial step of his scheme

  when the police officers from the com-
pound came through the barracks on their
usual inspection trip that evening ham-
mond spoke to them

  i have a request to make he began
and saw that other prisoners were watching
and listening suspiciously

  whats your request hammond asked
the officer he addressed

  when i was sentenced to a term here
kirk hammond said they told me that
whenever i was willing to cooperate with
the vramen and assist them in their re-
searches i would be released from detention
here on kuum i am willing now to do as
they wish will you notify your authorities
and also thayn marden the vramen repre-
sentative on earth

  the officer was a hooman and not with-
out the prejudices of his people he stiffened
and looked at hammond with unfriendly
eyes

  very well ill send a message by undi-
mensional telaudio to earth at once

  when the officers had gone gurth lund
and the other prisoners looked at hammond
with a deep hatred surpassing their former
hostility

  so you are going to beg off and go back
to the vramen who sent you here raged
lund

 hammond made no answer there was so
much raw hatred of him in the room that
he felt the imminence of an explosion

  the police officer returned later

  your request has been granted by the
federated suns officials at earth thayn
marden representing the vramen will come
here to kuum if you prove your sincerity
by answering her questions you will be taken
back to earth as a free man

  when the officer had again departed one
of the furious hoomen prisoners in the room
muttered a threat that reached hammonds
ears

  he will if he lives that long

chapter xi
inside the force-wall

courageously hammond knew that
he had confirmed all the distrust
and suspicions of the other hoomen by

his action only quobba knew the truth

  the others bitterly regarded him as a
proved traitor lund he knew would kill
him if he had a chance even iva wilson
passed stonily by him next morning when
the meh started for the jungle

  only old thol orr remained unaffected
by the general rage he looked curiously at
hammond as they drove to the jungle

so you are going to cooperate with the
vramen well perhaps that is for the best

  you dont seem to hate the vramen as
much as the other hoomen do hammond
said

  the old algolian shook his head

  im a scientist and the vramen are very
great scientists who are responsible for much
of our progress in the last few thousand
years

  but you dont resent the fact that they
hoard the secret of unlimited life for them-
selves so they can dominate the hoomens
galactic civilization

  thol orr shrugged

  i suppose i do resent it a little but the
vramen lead such hard barren loveless
lives that i hardly envy them their immor-
tality and power

  kirk hammond was extremely careful in
the jungle that day and the days that fol-
lowed he knew that many of his enraged
fellowrprisoners would be only too glad to
see him meet with a fatal accident

  he found opportunities to confer secretly
with rab quobba and shawn tammas the
little mizarian always the loyal shadow of
his big vegan friend had been let into the
secret

  upon the eighth day when they returned
from the jungle at dusk a police officer came
into the barracks to hammond

  a ship has arrived from earth thayn
marden of the vramen is here and will ques-
tion you about your request

  hammonds pulse jumped the moment
upon which his whole precarious scheme de-
pended had arrived the others watched
him with bitter hatred as he started out of
the barracks he glanced at rab quobba
meaningly the big vegan played up to his
cue and strode into the corridor after ham-
mond swearing furiously

  its blasted good riddance of you quob-
ba bellowed i hope i never see your face
again you cursed traitor

  but out in the corridor quobba dropped
his voice and asked hastily
the star of life	

  then its now tonight

  hammond nodded swiftly

  im going to try it if i fail the rest of
you will lose nothing

  he gave rapid directions

get wilson and the other men of our
band to stroll with you near the compound
then if the force-wall is turned off you
can make a rush in through it at once
the vegan nodded swiftly

  ive already told them that i have a plan
for seizing a ship theyll follow me

  the guard officer was waiting impatiently
outside the barracks hammond followed
him through the twilight to the compound
his escort made a signal to the guard in the
tower atop the police building a section of
the force-wall died and they stepped inside
the wall flamed up again behind them

  kirk hammonds eyes flew to the single
star-ship that was parked on the tarmac it
was a small black cruiser a blunt-nosed
oval bulk

its hooman crew were talking idly with
some of the police officers they all
looked curiously at kirk hammond as he
whs led inside the building he looked
keenly about the corridors inside as he was
taken to an office in the room the sirian
commandant of police was talking with
thayn marden hammonds heart jumped
as the vraman girl turned and met his eyes
again her strange uncanny beauty struck
him

  slim in black shorts her body shimmering
with that faint pearly luminescence from
white limbs to ashen blond hair thayn was
as his mind had pictured her many times in
the past weeks

  her blue eyes searched his face

  you are willing now to cooperate with
our researches in exchange for your free-
dom

  kirk hammond nodded

  yes i might as well for the other pris-
oners here think im a traitor to them any-
way

  if you will answer some preliminary
questions to prove your sincerity i shall re-
turn with you to earth thayn told him
hammond looked at the commandant

  ive a certain condition to make but its
for your ears alone

  the sirian commandant looked doubtful
at that but thayn marden reassured him

  it is quite safe to leave him with me i

have a shocker and the man is not danger-
ous

  the commandant nodded respectfully

  as you wish i shall have your ship re-
 fueled with copper for immediate return
 to earth

  kirk hammond had already noticed the
 shockers silver tube in thayns belt he
 knew how swiftly she could use the weapon

  thayn was looking at him curiously

  now what is the condition you have to
 make which you did not want him to hear

  hammond nerved himself for the part he
 had to play everything depended on his
 carrying it through until he got his chance

  thayn it wasnt just freedom that made
 me agree to what you asked he said ear-
 nestly it was to see you and be near you
 again

  what do you mean the vraman girl
 asked doubtfully

  it was because im in love with you
 hammond said im the prize fool of the
 universe to be so but i cant help it

  thayn stiffened a strange strained look
 came into her beautiful white face at his
 avowal

  that is madness there can be no talk of
 love between you and me

  why not he demanded you may be
 immortal but youre still a girl and i love
 you

  you dont know what youre saying
 she burst no vraman can love or marry
 it is one of the penalties of our life

  she had not doubted the truthfulness of
 his avowal he had counted on that had
 counted on that brain-record which had led
 her and the others to think him in love with
 her he did not love her at all hammond
 told himself fiercely he was lying but the
 lie and the trick were just revenge for the
 trick she had used upon him weeks before

  he took a step toward her speaking ear-
 nestly

  thayn you cant mean that what is
 there to prevent our being happy together

  there was pain in her white face as she
 answered

  i cannot tell you the reasons but it is
 impossible

  she had never looked more beautiful
 than she did then standing before him with
 that strange aching look in her face and
 eyes hammond found it almost fatally easy
 to pretend passion

  but he had not forgotten his purpose he
	startling stories

stepped closer put his arms around her

  thayn you must listen to me theres
nothing to stand between us-

  she tried to draw back the look of strange
misery haunting her blue eyes hammonds
hand dropped to her slim waist and touched
the silver tube in her belt he suddenly
snatched it out and sprang back thayn
marden looked at him her face dead-white
stunned it was only a trick

 the same one you used on me ham-
mond flared savagely

she opened her lips to shout but be-
fore she could do so he had levelled the
shocker and pressed the stud on its back he
had questioned quobba closely about these
and other weapons and what he had
learned served him well now from the
muzzle of the little tube sprang a thin beam
of pale radiance that hit thayns body
squarely

  the vraman girl collapsed to the floor
without a sound stunned by the electric
shock that paralyzed her nervous system
hammond found himself shaking his own
nerves at breaking pitch somehow he had
not expected thayn to react to his pretended
avowal of love as she had it had almost
seemed that she-

  youre a fool he told himself savagely
and youre likely to be a dead fool if you
dont hurry

  he went to the door of the office and
peered out then slipped out into the corridor
he had noted a stair and he sprang up it at
once he met no one until he reached the
second floor it held the living quarters of
the police officers and one was coming down
the passage hammond dropped the man in-
stantly with a flash of his shocker and ran
on up the stair to the tower

 two hooman guards were lounging in
the little tower-room he drooped one with
the shocker as they turned but the other
man cried out and grabbed for his energy-
pistol then the shocker beam hit him
hammond heard a sound of alarmed voices
below in response to that cry

  there may still be time he gritted run-
ning toward the switchboard that was the
main object in the little room

  there was a bank of a dozen switches on
it he pulled them down one after another
whirled to the window

  the force-wall had died and the groups
of hoomen who had been loitering at a little

distance outside it were now running for-
ward into the compound they were led
by big yelling rab quobba

  the wall is down he heard the sirian
commandant shouting

  hammond went down the stairs in leaps
as an uproar of battle broke from below a
fierce conflict was already going on in the
lower floors quobba and jon wilson and
the other prisoners had gamed a surprise en-
trance before the police here could use their
weapons

  a few energy-pistols roared and crackled
in the corridors and men shrieked but
kirk hammond coming down behind the
guards swept them with the shocker and
that decided the fight they dropped in
heaps

  the combat was soon over the guards all
stunned two hoomen were dead and
others had been wounded by pistol-blasts
rab quobba had a great burn on his cheek
and his eyes were flaming with battle-light

  hammond you did it he bellowed
weve got our ship now

  jon wilson stared incredulously at kirk
hammond

  you opened the force-wall but we
thought you a traitor

  you should be convinced at last that im
not hammond said sharply

  they crowded around him slapping his
back trying to express their excited emotion

  perhaps i was wrong about you being a
spy gurth lund said somberly though
ill still never like any man who loves a
vraman

  i dont care whether you like me or not
hammond retorted the thing to do is to get
away from kuum at once

  jon wilsons eyes flamed that ship
out there will take us anywhere in the
galaxy and we can man it

  then its ho for althar bellowed rab
quobba this is the chance weve been
hoping for for years the chance to find the
secret of the vramens life and power

  shawn tammas interposed a shrewd ob-
jection

  that ship has the vramens device built
into it like all others they can explode it
if we venture into the forbidden region
around althar

  i believe we can find a way around that
obstacle jon wilson said quickly well
take thayn marden with us
the star of life	

  hammond looked troubled wilson seemed
to understand his feelings for he added i
give my word well not harm her but ive
a plan by which we can use her to get
through the vramens safeguards

  the whole prison colony was in wild ex-
citement as they made hasty preparations
for departure

  jon wilson spoke aloud to the seething
crowd

  we cant take all of you and my own
group were selected and trained for just
such an attempt as we are going to make

  luck send you reach althar and the se-
cret shouted a big antarian

  hammond found thol orr in the crowd

  thol i want you to come with us you
know more of corvus cluster than any hoo-
man here

  the old algolian looked doubtful but he
was unable to refuse the opportunity ham-
mond held out to him

  i think its a mad quest this one of yours
for the secret of immortality but i would
like to solve that strange radiation that puz-
zled me so years ago ill go i believe its a
doomed voyage but i have not long to live
in any case

  you and all other hoomen will live un-
limited lives if we succeed hammond
promised

  iva wilson was also among their comple-
ment but he found no time to speak to her
in the hurry of last-minute preparations
wilson quobba and the other experienced
star-ship men examined and prepared the
ship every pound of copper possible was
loaded in it as fuel for the atomic generators
meanhile the undimensional telaudio ap-
paratus of the police was wrecked so no
warnings could be sent out

  the guards and thayn marden still lay
unconscious in the building kirk hammond
himself carried the vraman girl into the
ship and bound her carefully into a recoil-
chair in one of the small cabins

  the feverish preparations were finished
and tammas and quobba and the others
trooped aboard the big vegan took the pilot-
chair while lund and wilson went below to
start the atomic generators

  the jets roared and the ship rose from
nighted kuum it shot out into clear space
and then its generators droned louder as it
flew in the direction of the distant star-
cluster which enclosed mysterious althar
and its great secret

chapter xii
into the sun-svxirm

the incredible vault of starry space
stretched before the bridge-room win-
dows gazing into that vast star-gemmed
gloom kirk hammond felt crushed by an
agoraphobia such as he had never before
experienced

  it was too big too wide too empty he
was still only a man of the twentieth cen-
tury and could not reconcile a mind still at-
tuned to the brief horizons of earth to the
vast glooms and flaring abyssal lamps of
the suns

 but rab quobba and tammas and the
others appeared in highest spirits as the ship
drove faster quobba acted as pilot and the
wizened little mizarian as flight-engineer
and they seemed perfectly to understand
the bewildering banks of controls and in-
struments

  ill throw in the space-split now and
well really get going the vegan said

  he reached for a communicator and spoke
through it to the enerator-rooms deeper in
the ship

  full power wilson im putting on the
drive

  the propulsion jets were throbbing
steadily but as quobba slowly opened a
big lever the needles on the space-speed
dials jumped to dizzy heights kirk ham-
mond began to understand a little the jets
were what drove the ship but the space-
split was what made it super-velocities pos-
sible

  if were actually splitting three-dimen-
sional space ahead of us how can we see
space through our windows he asked

  we are seeing by projected rays that
shortcut the ordinary dimensions as in the
instantaneous undimensional telaudio those
windows are now really vision-screens

  quobba can we reach corvus cluster
without the police network becoming aware
of our course

  sure we can unless were unlucky enough
to meet a patrol quobba answered the
real trouble begins when we hit the clus-
ter

  corvus is completely uncharted and that
will make it tough to navigate added tam-
mas besides we dont know just where
	startling stories

inside it althar lies and therell be the
vraman to pass somehow

 thayn marden will surely help us on
that last problem rather than let the ship be
destroyed hammond said ill go back
and see if shes come to yet

  when he entered the little cabin in which
thayn was confined he found her fully con-
scious and trying to break the bonds that
held her in the recoil-chair

  she looked up at him and her blue gaze
was flaming upon his face

  so you have stolen this star-ship and
youre heading toward althar

 we are hammond said grimly and
were going to reach it and find the secret
you vramen have hoarded so long

 you will never reach althar thayn
said swiftly you have no chance whatever
and you will all perish if you try

  you will perish with us thayn he re-
minded her for your own sake you will
have to help us

  you understand little of the vramen if
you think i would betray our greatest trust
merely to save myself

 kirk hammonds hopes sank he began
to see how little they could count on the
vraman girl to aid them in any way what-
ever

  thayn is it so wrong for us hoomen to
desire the secret of unlimited life and knowl-
edge and power that you possess he de-
manded

  it is wrong terribly wrong she replied
if you knew everything you would not
want to be immortal

 what do you mean

he shook her blond head

  i cannot explain without betraying
the secret itself

  hammond felt baffled

  mystery again im convinced you vra-
men make such a portentous mystery out of
althar simply to frighten away the hoomen
but well not be frightened

  it would be better if you were thayn
said sadly you are throwing away your
lives in a hopeless quest

  he went angrily out of the cabin and sent
one of the hoomen to guard the vraman
girl now that she was conscious in the
bridge-room he found jon wilson feverish
with excitement and hope as he peered into
the blurred void iva was there too and
looked question ingly at hammond

  will thayn help us to enter the cluster
  he shook his head

  she says she will perish with us rather
than help us

  then it looks bad for us quobba de-
clared in the hull of this ship as in all
star-ships is built the device the vramen
can explode by remote control and theyll
use it when we approach althar
couldnt we dig the thing out of the
hull and get rid of it hammond asked
tammas smiled

  you underestimate the vramen lad the
thing is always built so that attempts to re-
move it will detonate it

  jon wilson looked thoughtful

  i had an idea by which we might get past
that obstacle if we had thayn along and it
might work

  he turned to thol orr

  thol youve been in the cluster you
were sent to kuum for entering the for-
bidden region tell me did the vramen
first challenge you by telaudio when you
were captured

he old algolian nodded

  thats what happened i was trying
to trace the radiation i was studying when
there came a telaudio challenge when i
couldnt answer it the vramen ordered me
to remain motionless in space or theyd ex-
plode my cruiser they sent a ship out that
took me prisoner and turned me over to the
government for trial

  then jon wilson reasoned if thayn
marden would answer their telaudio chal-
lenge they would let us pass and we could
approach and land on althar

  theres no hope of that hammond told
him she wont do it no matter what
threats you make to her

  yet ive an idea by which we could get
around her refusal wilson said he looked
around there should be a stereo-cine-
camera in this ship for star-charting and
ill also need a sound recorder

  they watched uncomprehendingly as jon
wilson began setting up the two instruments
when he had found them hours passed as
the ship rocked on through the void toward
the star-swarm of danger and mystery
hammond slept and then tried to learn from
little tammas something of the piloting of
the ship

  it was far too complicated for him to learn
much about it he found meanwhile wilson
the star

still worked setting up his instruments in a
semi-concealed position below the control
panel an intolerable tension grew in them
all as corvus cluster expanded from a misty
star into a great ball of shining specks each
speck was a star and there were hundreds
of them

  kirk hammond stared fascinated that
great hive of swarming suns held peril and
enigma in it were uncharted mazes of me-
teor drift and dark clouds and rogue plane-
toids in it also was althar

  thol orr looked forth with him

  we will reach the edge of the cluster
tomorrow very soon after we enter well
be challenged

  wilson still says he has something that
will enable us to pass the challenge ham-
mond answered doubtfully

  on the next day when the great cluster
filled half the heavens ahead of them jon
wilson announced his preparations were
complete

 now bring thayn marden in here he
directed

  thayns eyes flew to the huge cluster of
flaring suns bulking in the vision-screen
windows as she entered the bridge but the
blond vraman girl showed no sign of emo-
tion

  she stood facing jon wilson calmly

  will you reconsider your refusal to help us
win entrance to althar wilson demanded

  i will not you will all be doomed if you
venture inside the cluster

  jon wilson went on plying her with more
demands hammond frowned it didnt
make sense for she only answered with firm
refusals

 take her back to her cabin wilson
finally said

 when that had been done the hooman

of lute



leader looked at them triumphantly

  i think we now have a way to pass the
vramens challenge

  he took out the stereo-cinecamera and
sound recorder which had been concealed
beneath the banks of controls in the front of
the room

  these instruments were making a com-
plete cine-stereo film of thayn marden and
everything she said

  what good will that do us rab quobba
demanded

  i am going to cut this film into separate
bits each containing a word or two and
then piece it together again wilson ex-
plained the pieced-together version will
give a stereo-picture of thayn marden say-
ing exactly what we want her to say

  and youll use that to answer the telaudio
when the vramen challenge us cried ham-
mond wilson it may really work

  if it doesnt wilson said grimly well
never know it for the ship will be instantly
exploded around us

  the work of piecing together the film was
painstaking it was hardly finished by the
time they reached the edge of the cluster
thol orr had been poking the spectroscopes
and other instruments toward the middle of
the cluster

  there it is-the unique stellar radiation
that i tried to trace into the cluster years
ago the old algolian exclaimed a radia-
tion concentrated in certain octaves of the
electromagnetic spectrum like no other
stars

  theres no time now for your scientific
research wilson said hastily i want you
to set up a direction-finder and hook it to
our telaudio receiver youre a radiation ex-
pert and can do that

kirk hammond thought he under-
stood

  when the vramen challenge us that will
give us the direction of althar

 thats the idea otherwise we would
simply have to hunt blindly for the world
of the vramen in this jungle of suns

  his vivid description of the cluster was not
exaggerated it was truly a jungle of suns
that bulked all across the black sky before
the rushing ship

  green smoldering red pure white bril-
liant blue blazed the stars that seethed to-
gether in this mighty swarm though they
were really great distances from each other
the immense size of the corvus cluster made
its stars seem crowded closely the ship
with rab quobba at the controls drove past
the fringe of suns at the rim of the swarm
before them around them the whole sky
was now a bewildering maze of blazing
stars

  its like piloting in a madhouse of space
muttered the big vegan no charts no
bearings and the indicators going crazy
the tell-tales on the control panels were
buzzing and ringing and bobbing to show
meteoric drift and other dangerous debris
around them

  quobba coolly drove the ship at slightly
reduced speed continually changing course
to avoid unseen masses of drift or great
colls of black cloud that reached like oc-
topus tentacles between the hiving stars
meteor-dust rattled on the hull uke the
crash of hail

  suddenly the telaudio buzzed sharply and
in its square screen appeared the figure of
a vraman-a tall handsome man seated at
a switchboard in a room of crowded ap-
paratus

  state the identity of your ship immediate-
ly he ordered sharply

  theyve spotted us by their locators
said jon wilson stand back out of sight
of the telaudio all of you

  hammond and the others did so wilson
switched on their own telaudio transmitter
and at the same time turned on the stereo-
film projector he had prepared directly in
front of the telaudio appeared the life-like
stereoscopic image of thayn marden facing
the transmitter

  this is thayn marden returning to al-
thar her image spoke there are none ex-
cept vramen on this ship

  the image of thayn spoke jerkily but

otherwise was completely realistic they
waited tensely but the vraman in the screen
appeared to suspect nothing

  very well-you are permitted to con-
tinue of course he said and switched off

  by the devils of vega it worked ex-
claimed rab quobba gleefully if it hadnt
the ship would be blown to atoms by now
it may still be blown if they discover the
deception before we reach althar wilson
said did you get a direction-bearing
thol

  thol orr nodded as he examined the in-
strument he had attached to the telaudio
this will give you the course to althar
rab quobba veered the ship to follow the
bearing for hours kirk hammond watched
as their vessel plunged on through the star-
ry masses of the corvus cluster old thol
orr finally spoke puzzledly to hammond

  i cant understand this the strange ra-
diation ive been trying to trace comes from
exactly the same direction were following
the same as althar

  do you suppose it has any connection
with the vramens world hammond asked
wonderingly

  i dont know muttered the old algolian
but its getting rapidly stronger and i am
beginning to suspect something incredible
two hours later the old scientist uttered
a cry and pointed ahead as the ship emerged
from a belt of dark cloud into an open space
gods of algol look at that star

  they were deep in the center of the great
corvus cluster and here was a space less
crowded with suns at the very heart of
this space encompassed all around by the
swarming hosts of suns shone a single
strange star such as kirk hammond had
never seen before

  it burned in weird opalescent glory it
appeared to have no single hue but red
green violet and golden yellow spun in its
light like the writhing colors of a huge fire-
opal it was uncanny hypnotic in its alien
splendor as it spun here at the heart of the
cluster bathing in its rays a single planet a
little smaller than earth

  the star choked thol orr the source
of the strange radiation that always mysti-
fied me a star that is somehow a generator
pouring out floods of unique hard radiation
such as no other star emits rays largely
bunched in the octaves of the spectrum be-
yond the gamma rays

  even weak radiation of that type has
the star of life	

deep biophysical effects on living matter
think what must be the effect on life of the
furious torrent of the radiation from that
star

 awe fell upon kirk hammond and on the
others

  you mean that the radiation of that star
may be what gives immortality

  it must be cried thol orr it is a star
of life and that planet that swings in its
rays must be the world of althar

chapter xiii
on mysterious altiuir

such a supposition was too staggering
for any of them to take in at once
they had expected many things but none
of their possibilities had included this over-
whelming one

  a star of life a star whose radiance was
so unprecedentedly chargedly with torrents
of unique hard radiation that it produced on
living bodies the deep subtle biological ef-
fects that resulted in immortality

  it cant be whispered jon wilson star-
ing wildly at the opalescent glory ahead
and yet-

  it would explain everything burst gurth
lund excitedly it would explain why the
men who first found this star and world be-
came immortal when they felt its rays

 yes and it would explain why all the
vramen go back for part of each year to
althar to renew their immortality they go
there to bathe in the rays of that star

 rab quobba looked incredulously

  but our ship is already inside the rays of
the star and i dont feel any differently

  it would have no effect on us in the ship
thol orr reminded all star-ships have a
hull-lining of tungsten gauze to block out
radiation that might be harmful

  but if its true all we have to do is land
on althar and bathe in those rays to become
immortal said hammond dazedly

  iva wilson pressed close to him trembling
im frightened theres something evil
about that star

 jon wilson made decision

well land on althar but we must avoid
the vramens citadel wherever that is
bring thayn marden here again he or-
dered she may talk now that we have

reached the forbidden world

  thayns face was deathly white when she
was brought into the bridge-room

  so you have reached the star of life
that seals your doom you must never be
allowed to return with the secret

  well return all right rasped wilson
why when the galaxy hears of this star
whose rays give unending youth althar will
be crowded with people who will come from
every star

 that must not be thayn exclaimed
you think you have learned all our secrets
but you do not know what horror and dan-
ger waits on althar

  thayn were going to land there and
you cant stop us kirk hammond reasoned
with her wont you give up this futile
resistance and tell us about this world and
where its safe to land

 thayn spoke after a few moments of
thought

  very well i see that i may as well tell
you land your ship in the high mountains
in the north of althar that is the only safe
place

  then that said wilson grimly is the
one place where we wont land obviously
shed like us to come down there because its
where the vramen would capture us

  the swift expression that crossed thayns
face proved that the hooman leader had
guessed right

  thol orr had been peering through a tel-
escope at the planet that swung in the weird
opalescent blaze of the uncanny star

  there appear to be strange forests of
some kind over the equatorial regions of
the planet

  then land in the forests wilson directed
you must not thayn marden cried in-
stantly that is the country of the third
men and it means disaster if you land there
the third men disaster thats all
bluff wilson snapped its quite evi-
dent from the fact that youre afraid well
land there that its the very place we should
land

 kirk hammond was troubled by the ex-
treme agony of spirit that showed in the
vraman girls beautiful face

  i dont know wilson there may actual-
ly be danger of some kind there

  dont listen to hammond hes still in
love with the girl said gurth lund harshly
rab quobba shrugged

  were taking a chance wherever we land
	startling stories

on althar we might as well land in the
forests

  the ship was soon roaring through at-
mosphere as the dull green surface of the
forbidden planet rushed up toward them

grotesque and alien was the great
forest that stretched below it was a
forest of huge tree-mosses enormous bil-
lowy cushions of dark green that towered
up for scores of feet the star-ship dropped
between the great mosses and came to rest
in a sunlit grassy glade the drone of the
atomic generators died into silence

  jon wilsons eyes were blazing

  althar he whispered weve reached it
at last the key to age-old mystery

  testers show breathable atmosphere out-
side reported shawn tammas from the in-
strument panel

  wilson turned eagerly

  then open the doors we are going out
into the rays of that sun-going out to be-
come immortal

wait cried thayn marden i beg of
you not to go out into that radiation without
protection if it once strikes your bodies it
will blast your lives in a way i cannot tell
gurth lund scoffed

  its only another attempt to scare us of
course she doesnt want us to step out into
the rays of immortality

  but iva wilson surprised them

  i- believe she may be telling the truth
the hooman girl said slowly even if she
doesnt care about us i dont think she wants
anything to happen to kirk hammond
hammond was a little startled by that
and glanced quickly at thayns drawn white
face was it possible that was true

  we might as well take precautions until
we learn more about these rays he said
wearing protection cant hurt us and we
can take it off as soon as were certain the
rays are really the secret of life

  you will need ray-proof shields for your
bodies and skulls thayn marden said
quickly

  hammond turned to thol orr

  you spoke of a tungsten gauze interlin-
ing that shields the ship from radiation
couldnt we use some of that

  it was the device they finally adopted
the inner plates of the hull were opened in
a fuel-room where the break in the radia-
tion shields would not be noticed shawn
tammas deftly fitted sections of the ray-

proof gauze into gleaming garments that
went over their middle bodies beneath their
clothing and into small caps to protect their
skulls

  now said jon wilson eagerly when the
work was finished we can go out

 the door opened and they stepped out
into warm dry air that bore an exhalation
of strange scents as it whispered through the
great moss-forest all around them rose the
huge grotesque bulks of the green mosses
like enormous cushions between the tow-
ering growths shot shafts of the weird opal-
escent radiance of the dazzling star of life

  there was an uncanny absence of small
living creatures no birds or even insects
flitted through the somber moss-forest and
the silence was deep and brooding they
stood in an open space bathed in that strange
changing radiance and looking up at the
sun the opalescent star blazed and winked
and changed in hue until they had to turn
their dazzled eyes away

  it was decided to reconnoiter their sur-
roundings hammond and quobba started
eastward through the forest while others
went in different directions

 look at those mountains the vegan
exclaimed when he and hammond had
climbed to a higher point in the forest

  high and blue and distant in the north
rose great peaks clustered closely together
so far away they seemed misty and vague
over the distant peaks brooded a strange
rosy glow visible even in the glare of day
a pulsing mysterious radiance

 there is something up there in the
mountains that produces that weird glow
hammond said tensely it could be the
citadel of the vramen thayn tried to get us
to land there

they went back to the ship the others
had seen nothing but illimitable moss-
forest but jon wilsons face lengthened
when he heard the report of hammond and
quobba

  the last think we want is for the vra-
men to learn of our presence on althar
he exclaimed

  then wed better stay hidden here in the
forest while were studying this radiation
hammond said ive an idea about that

  they went back into the star-ship and
kirk hammond spoke to thol orr

  youre a radiation expert thol if you
analyzed the exact frequencies of this stel-
the star of life	

lar radiation could you reproduce it from
artificial generators later

  i think that i could the old algolian said
thoughtfully though it wouldnt be easy
to produce artificial rays of such strength
then this is what we should do ham-
mond proposed earnestly well stay here
long enough for thol orr to study and an-
alyze the radiation of the star if it is really
those rays that give immortality hell learn
enough about them to reproduce them in
the laboratory

  we can slip away from here before the
vramen find us go back and spread the se-
cret of the rays all over the galaxy that
will break the vramens monopoly on im-
mortality and thus destroy the basis of their
domination over the hoomen

  your plan is good hammond jon wil-
son approved warmly and once were sure
the rays cant harm us we can bathe in
them before we leave and go back as im-
mortals ourselves

  kirk hammond felt a sense of unreality
at that it seemed impossible that he should
ever become immortal living on for cen-
tury after century as the vramen did yet
already he had lived more than ten thou-
sand years

  if their belief was correct he had only to
bathe in the opalescent rays of that strange
sun to alter his bodily structure in every cell
and become practically undying thayn
marden had been listening and her face ex-
pressed deeper distress when she heard their
decision

  you must not stay here longer she
said desperately i told you before this
forest is part of the realm of the third men
you are in deadly danger

  who are the third men hammond de-
manded

  the vraman girl hesitated

  i cant tell you that without disclosing
more than you should know but this i will
tell you-there are other races here on al-
thar beside vramen and most dangerous
of them are the third men their instru-
ments may already have told them of our
landing here if so they will come and you
will be powerless to resist them

  the deep dread on thayns beautiful face
affected kirk hammond he could not be-
lieve entirely that she was lying

  its all designed to scare us gurth lund
said contemptuously naturally she is fran-
tic at what we plan to do

  they paid no further attention to the
vraman girl but gathered around thol orr
as he began setting up instruments for
analysis of the strange stellar radiation ev-
ery star-ship it seemed was well equipped
with apparatus for the assistance of naviga-
tion in unfamiliar regions of the galaxy
since these were hooman apparatus the
algolian was familiar with them

  kirk hammond felt a growing tension as he
waited with the others for thol orr to finish
his studies he knew they were on the very
verge of at last discovering that secret which
had so long been forbidden to the galaxy and
which they had risked and endured much to
find

  and thayns warnings had affected his
nerves he told himself that it was all mere
subterfuge on her part that instead of warn-
ing them of danger she would be only too
glad to see them destroyed even though it
meant death for herself and yet-

  i must be going a little batty from strain
to be falling for her tricks again hammond
told himself disgustedly

  thol orr seemed to grow more and more
puzzled and disturbed as he worked with his
spectroscopic and other instruments

  theres something sinister about this
radiation he muttered it could possibly
affect the cell-structure so deeply as to cause
a change that would mean unending cell-life
but it would also in that case bring about
other and less desirable changes

  do you mean that the radiation really is
somehow dangerous even though it confers
immortality wilson asked perplexedly

  that doesnt make sense hammond de-
clared

  thol orr started to explain but the words
never left his lips at that moment an abso-
lute darkness clapped down upon them with-
out warning they were plunged into a ray-
less night as though they had all been stricken
blind

  thayn marden cried out to them

  the third men are here take the ship up

at once

  kirk hammond was bewildered and heard
exclamations of amazement and fear from the
others

  someones coming through the door into
the ship yelled rab quobbas voice in the
blackness they-

  his warning shout ended in a groan and
they heard the thudding crash of a falling
body there was a rush of unseen feet into
	startling stories

the ship voices shouting the sound of quick
breathing iva screamed kirk hammond
started toward her and was grabbed by un-
seen hands the lightless ship seemed full
of uncanny assailants

chapter xiv
alien city

hammond struck blindly but next
moment something that felt like a liv-
ing loop of flesh wound tightly around his
body and pinioned his arms and legs

  he fell heavily to the floor lying there
he could hear the others being overcome as
rapidly by their unknown attackers

 ghosts or devils shawn tammas was
sputtering in the blackness theyve got
my-

  there was the sound of the little mizarian
falling punctuating his shout then a sharp
voice spoke in cold resonant accents

  they are all accounted for it declared
lift the veil

  there was the sound of a switch clicking
somewhere just outside the ships open door
the utter darkness abruptly vanished and
with the return of the daylight their at-
tackers appeared in full view around them

  there were two score men in all crowded
in here with the now bound and helpless
band of hoomen but they were no men
such as kirk hammond had ever seen

gods of vega breathed rab quobba
from where he lay bound what are they

 the third men exclaimed thayn in
accents of despair

  hammond stared unbelievingly these at-
tackers who had come under shield of sudden
darkness were human but they were far
stranger even than the vramen they seemed
a completely different species of humanity

  they were seven feet in average height
tall superbly statured men who wore short
close fitting dark tunics and whose white
bodies shone with an even deeper radiance
than the faint luminescence of the vramen

  they were completely hairless these third
men-their skulls smooth and bald their
eyes browless and lashless their hands
ended not in five fingers but in six sprouting
boneless members like tentacles capable of
manipulations far beyond those of ordinary
hands

 most uncanny of all to kirk hammond
were their faces by human standards those
radiant faces were regular and beautiful
but they were unhuman in their almost
complete lack of ordinary signs of emotion
they were the cold masklike faces of alien
gods one who seemed their leader spoke
authoritatively

  these people are obviously hoomen from
the outside who have somehow managed to
reach althar

  one of the third men spoke quickly to the
leader

 mar kann one of them is a vraman
this girl

  the leader called mar kann strode toward
the chair in which thayn marden was bound
his opaque eyes swiftly examined her bonds

  so you have been a prisoner of these
hoomen how did you come to be in their
hands

  thayn had dread in her blue eyes but she
remained stonily silent as she faced the
towering third man mar kann turned back
to the hoomen who lay helpless they had
been bound by loops like uncanny pink ropes
of living flesh

  where did you capture the vraman girl
and why did you come here he demanded

 kirk hammonds anger made him answer
boldly

  we came hunting for the secret of im-
mortality for our people

  the vramen are our enemies jon wil-
son added hopefully and that is why the girl
thayn marden is our captive it seems that
the vramen are your enemies too

mar kanns godlike face darkened
slightly

 that is true the vramen have long
thwarted my people and held us prisoned on
this world

  he seemed to think swiftly

  if you are their enemies you should be
our friends and i think we can help you
attain the immortality you seek for we would
like to see all races as immortal as ourselves
and the vramen

  you third men are undying too then
wilson asked wonderingly

  mar kann nodded curtly

  we are

  he went on to ask a question

  will you go peacefully with us to our dty
vonn there our director holl gormon can
come to terms with you on what you seek
the star of life	

  jon wilson looked excitedly at the others
well do it these people are the vramens
enemies and are going to help us

 thayn marden uttered an exclamation
make no bargains with the third men
they represent a terrible danger not only
to my people but-

  silence that girl mar kann said coldly
a third man whipped one of the pink
pseudo-living ropes around thayns lips
it tightened of its own accord gagging her
mar kann drew a small tube from his belt
and with it touched the bonds that held kirk
hammond and the other hoomen hammond
felt the pseudo-living ropes relax and fall
away he and rab quobba and the others
scrambled to their feet

  we will go now to vonn said mar kann
do not worry about your ship i will leave
men here to guard it and they will hide it
with the veil

 hammond felt disturbed and oppressed as
he followed the others out of the star-ship
with the third men his eyes were on
thayns blond head as she was marched along
ahead of them by two of the giant godlike
men he had received a strong impression
of the hatred directed at her by these men

  but what difference can it make to me
hammond thought doggedly shes proved
her enmity to us over and over

 wilson and gurth lund and most of the
other hoomen were in a seventh heaven of
excitement and hope but quobba and little
shawn tammas looked less elated

  i dont like the look of these third men
the wizened mizarian muttered they just
dont look human to me

 quobba shrugged

  if theyre enemies of the vramen thats
all we need to know though i admit they
give me the creeps too	

  outside the ship were several other third
men with a small apparatus cased in a black
plastic box

  mar kann spoke briefly to these

  remain here and guard the ship cast the
veil over it

 the others nodded and one turned
switches looking back hammond was
amazed to see these men and the star-ship
vanish suddenly from sight they simply
became invisible

  then the veil is the means of invisibility
you used to attack us hammond asked the
third man

 mar kann nodded slightly

  it is an ionic shield designed to refract
around itself all electromagnetic rays not
only light-rays but also the radiolocator
beams and spy-rays of the vramen inside
the shield of course there is absolute dark-
ness

  in the forest not far away were waiting
four slim fliers they were long tubular
craft whose bodies were of black plastic
instead of metal

  into one of these hammond iva wilson
and a few others of the hoomen followed mar
kann another third man took his place at a
simple control-panel in the front of the ma-
chine the plastic flier apparently did not
operate by atomic power for there was no
drone of generators when it started in-
stead it rose smoothly and in absolute
silence and then flew westward at high speed
over the moss-forest

  hammond felt a little bewildered by the
absence of metal and atomic power as com-
pared with the scientific powers these third
men had already displayed

  your science seems to have reached as
high or higher a development than that of
the vramen he said to mar kann

  the third man answered contemptuously

  the vramen are but children beside us
in mentality and scientific knowledge

  if thats so how have they been able to
prevent your people from leaving this
world

 they have not done so by their own
powers you may be sure of that was the
reply

kirk hammond was puzzled by that
answer it seemed that they had only
begun to penetrate the mysteries of althar

  why is it that you are called the third
men he asked after a moment

  mar kann looked at him sharply

  i cannot make further explanations holl
gormon our director will elucidate matters
further

  after an hours flight at great speed above
the grotesque moss-forests the four plastic
fliers rushed over an open plain it was
lighted by the opalescent glory of the setting
star of life a somber black city rose upon
the plain a square stark metropolis of
severely geometrical design

  so that is your city vonn exclaimed
jon wilson to the third men startled

  the city vonn was a mass of black cement
buildings surrounded by a heavy wall the


startling stories

flat-roofed structures rose in concentric
squares around a square massive black mass
that was highest of all

  the place was depressing in its severity of
outline and its lack of softening parks and
gardens it brooded darkly in the opalescent
sunset as the fliers swept low above its
streets

 men and women-the women as unhuman
in stature and appearance as the men-were
passing in the streets or could be glimpsed
working in glittering rooms that might be
factories or laboratories there appeared to
be no loiterers or chatting groups no sign of
relaxation or pleasure

  something else struck kirk hammond as
strange about the place nowhere in its dark
streets did he see any children childlessness
added somehow to the somberly oppressive
effect of the city vonn the fliers swept
down and landed amid similar craft in a
paved court beside that massive central
building

  mar kann spoke curtly

  holl gormon has already been notified of
our coming and will be awaiting us you will
follow me

  as they went with him into the building
and through shadowy black cement corri-
dors kirk hammond asked another question

  holl gormon is the head of your govern-
ment

  mar kann looked at him disdainfully

  we have no government holl gorman
has the most efficient brain of any of us and
therefore he naturally gives all orders con-
cerning public matters

  hammond didnt like that these super-
intellectual third men seemed even farther
removed from ordinary humanity than the
vramen they entered a medium-sized
chamber at a desk whose face was crowded
with screen-grids switches and lenses sat
one of the third men

  holl gormon director of the race appeared
little different in general mold from the rest
of his people but the intellectual power in
his cold face gave an even more chilling im-
pression

  you are welcome to vonn he told the
hoomen crisply the more so because you
bring what we have wanted above all else-
a vraman prisoner

  the vraman girl is our prisoner ham-
mond reminded him

 holl gormon looked at him with the
expresson of an austere man regarding a

defiant small boy

  of course i understand that he replied
but i am quite sure you will find there is
no need of distrusting us

  mar kann has already telepathed me in-
formation-hammond realized now how
word had been sent ahead-that you hoo-
men come here seeking the secret of im-
mortality we third men are in perfect
sympathy with your ambition

  is it really the opalescent sun of this world
whose rays bring immortality hammond
asked quickly

  you have guessed it holl gormon re-
plied the star of life is a star unique in
the whole galaxy it is a gigantic generator
of peculiar hard radiation due to the
presence inside the star of quantities of radio-
active matter in unprecedented percentages

  men age and die because their body cells
deteriorate so that they cannot renew them-
selves this unique hard radiation has a
polarizing effect that makes the cells capable
of renewing themselves indefinitely there
is no deterioration with age as is ordinarily
the case so that anyone who subjects him-
self periodically to the stars rays cannot
die

  could those peculiar octaves of hard
radiation be duplicated and produced arti-
fically old thol orr asked

holl gormon nodded before he re-
plied

  it could be done we shall be glad to help
you design ray-generators that can bring im-
mortality to every hooman in the galaxy

  jon wilsons gaunt face glowed

  if you help us accomplish that well do
anything you ask in return for that would
end the vramens domination over us

  the third man glanced at thayn marden
whose slim figure stood defiant even though
she was still bound and gagged

 the vramen are our deadly enemies
also he said in hard tones they are far
beneath us in mentality and knowledge but
have prevented us from leaving althar to
carry the gift of immortality to the rest of
the galaxy

 kirk hammond voiced again that doubt
that had puzzled him when he had talked to
mar kann

  if youre beyond the vramen in science
how can they prevent you from leaving
althar

  to leave would require star-ships and
the star of life	

star-ships must have atomic generators and
copper fuel holl gormon replied and
there is almost no copper or any other metal
on this world that is due to the peculiar
chemical constitution of the star which gave
it birth

  the vramen bring their metals and cop-
per fuel from outside to their city sharanna
in the mountains he added only by seiz-
ing their ships and copper there could we
hope to leave this world

  cant you do that if your weapons and
powers are so much above theirs ham-
mond asked skeptically

  holl gormon looked at him coldly

  i said our science was far beyond theirs
and it is but though the vramen are in-
ferior to us they have one weapon which we
have never been able to conquer

  it is called the barrier and it is a belt of
mind-destroying vibrations which surround
their city sharanna it was not invented by
the vramen themselves for such an inven-
tion would be far beyond them it was in-
vented by the fourth men another race who
live on althar and hate us they gave it to
the vramen to use against us

 kirk hammond felt more and more be-
wildered they had expected to find the
citadel of the immortal vramen here on al-
thar but they had not expected to find other
races

  and now it seemed there were at least
two others-these super-intellectual third
men and another mysterious race they called
the fourth men

  and these others and the vramen were
apparently tangled in complicated hostility
and warfare

  what was their hostility about holl
gormon evaded that question

  that is too complicated to explain now

the point is are you willing to help us crush
the vramen so that we can give immortality
to all the galaxy

  jon wilson and the others replied quickly
in the affirmative hammond himself a little
more slowly

  then said the third man you can help
us overcome the weapon of the vramen the
barrier this vraman girl must know much
about its operation we can extract the
knowledge from her

 kirk hammond looked uncertainly at
thayn he knew she was his enemy in this
struggle but he didnt like the idea of turn-
ing her over to deadly foes

  the vraman girl will not be harmed he
asked

  of course not answered holl gormon
coldly mind-reading is childs play for us
we do not even need to use mechanical
brain-recorders since our telepathic powers
are sufficient to probe lesser minds

  jon wilson spoke quickly

  then you are at liberty to question the
girl

  holl gormons cold eyes showed a faint
trace of satisfaction

  take her back to the psychological de-
partment mar kann tomorow we will ex-
tract from her everything she knows about
the barrier she cannot understand its
scientific details but what she has seen of its
operation should enable our own scientists
at last to deduce its principles and devise
means of overcoming it

  thayn marden was led by the guards out
of the chamber toward the back of the great
building she flashed a last glance at kirk
hammond from the door it made him un-
easy for in it he read supernal dread and
appeal

chapter xv
the fight with the machine

for some unknown reason hammond
was disturbed by the agony of that un-
spoken appeal as thayn disappeared he
turned back to holl gormon

  you promise that the girl will not be
harmed in any way he asked sharply
again

  the third man nodded curtly

  you shall see her for yourself tomorrow
when the questioning is over will that satis-
fy you

  hammond nodded slowly but he still felt
uncomfortable about the whole matter

  you hoomen will be our guests and our
allies in conquering sharanna and the
vramen holl gormon went on suitable
quarters will be assigned you here in vonn

  he touched a switch to their surprise it
was a machine-servant that answered the
thing was a heavy plastic box with jointed
arms which rolled into the office on its wheels
and spoke in a rasping monotone

  your orders

  conduct these people to the west suite on
the third floor holl gormon instructed

  the machine-servant turned and started to
roll out of the room saying tonelessly will
you please follow me

  it will take you to your quarters holl
gormon said to them i shall confer with
you again later tonight

  kirk hammond unwillingly followed with
wilson and iva and the others there was
something curt about their dismissal that he
did not like the machine-servant took them
to a lift up to the third floor and into a suite
of connecting rooms that looked across the
flat black roofs of sunset-lighted vonn

 these are your rooms the machine
spoke raspingly you will find the nutrition-
dispensary buttons beside each door the red
button will summon one of us to hear your
commands

  the thing rolled away the hoomen looked
wonderingly around the rooms they were
sternly austere furnished with padded plastic
couches a few square chairs and nothing else

  the somber effect was increased by the
black walls the star of life sinking in
wondrous glory beyond the city shot its last
opalescent rays into the chambers big un-

  inhibited rab quobba broke the silence to
vent his impressions of the place

  the whole city is about as cheerful as a
tomb and these third men are more domi-
neering than the vramen they look at us
as if we were animals

  i didnt like the way they spoke of the
vramen as of low mentality hammond
answered uneasily if they think that of
them what must they think of us

 jon wilson was too flushed with the
triumph of his dreams to listen to forebod-
ings

  they are going to be our allies against the
vramen and what powerful allies they will
be just think well go back with the secret
of those rays of life to give to everybody in
the galaxy

  old thol orr who had been silent and
thoughtful spoke up now

  just who can be the fourth men to whom
they referred

 hammond shook his head

  its all a mystery whoever the fourth
men are theyre hostile to these people and
must be at least equal to them in science to
have devised a weapon that has stopped
them

  he was struck by the brooding look on
thol orrs face and asked the old algolian
a question

  youve got some theory about the fourth
men

  thol orr shook his head

  just a suspicion no more his face be-
came somber but if what i suspect is true
then these third men and the so-called
fourth men are easily explained and the
explanation means we will not give im-
mortality to the galaxy

  thats all nonsense and i dont want to
hear any more of it jon wilson said angrily
think of all weve endured since we banded
together on earth to win that secret for our
people now that its in our grasp were not
going to turn defeatist for no reason

twilight came and light came on in
the building it was a blue sourceless
light that seemed pumped somehow out
through the whole city it added a final touch
of the uncanny to the black brooding
metropolis kirk hammond shared nutritive
liquids drawn from the automatic dispenser
in each room then he drifted to the farth-
est room of the suite and stood looking out
over the blue-lit city
the stab of life	

  his thoughts were on thayn marden she
was somewhere in the building and on the
next day the third men would use their
mastery of mental powers to wrest from her
the secret of the vraman defense he knew
he should be glad that this was so but he
was not

 a soft hand touched his arm and he
turned to look into the shy doubtful face of
iva wilson

  you are here all by yourself she said
then she asked suddenly her dark eyes
searching his face what is worrying you
nothing really hammond answered i
just dont like this place and these people
nor do i iva said shivering slightly i
wish we had never come here

  he put his arm around her shoulders and
she nestled against him but there was still
doubt and speculation in her face as she
looked up at him

  kirk will you do something if i ask you
she said finally

  sure iva-what is it

 will you kiss me she asked unex-
pectedly

 hammond was startled then a little
doubtfully he put his arms around her her
face pressed his almost fiercely her ups warm
and quivering but when she drew away
there was a glimmer of tears in her eyes

  i thought so and now i am sure of it she
said you are in love with thayn marden
for heavens sake are you going to start
that again he began impatiently i ex-
plained to your father and the others that it
wasnt so that-

  you could convince them kirk iva said
steadily for they are men but you cannot
deceive me any more than thayn herself
could conceal from me that she loves you
thayn in love with me youre surely
mad iva she hates me despises me-

  she loves you i am certain of it iva
told him i watched her in the ship and
it must be a very great love indeed that can
make her forget that she is a vraman and
you a hooman

  kirk hammond felt overwhelmed stunned
and out of his mental chaos rushed the con-
viction the certainty he had fought it down
all along he had crowded it into his sub-
conscious where only the mechanical brain-
reader and ivas keen eyes had been able to
see it he had deceived even himself by
constant reiterations

  but it was the truth he had loved thayn

marden from the first moment he had seen
her he knew it now and would know it
while he lived iva seemed to read his cat-
astrophic self-revelation in his face she
shook her head sadly

  i am sorry for you kirk for even though
you and thayn love each other i am sure
that no vraman will ever marry a hooman
no vraman has ever married anyone in all
our history

  kirk hammond looked at her with drawn
unhappy face

  iva i wish that things had turned out
differently

he ignored that

  kirk listen my father and gurth
would call me traitor for saying this but it
is true i do not love the vramen but i fear
far more these strange unhuman people
called the third men

 i think that thayn may have really
warned truthfully of danger when she
warned against these folk the vramen
though they have monopolized immortality
and have arrogated the direction of our
civilization to themselves have never really
oppressed us hoomen i would rather trust
them than these cold-eyed unhuman
strangers

  thats the way ive felt from the first
hammond burst out iva ive got to find
thayn and learn the truth about all this
from her

  i fear that you will never see her again if
she remains in the hands of these third men
who so hate her people iva said
hammonds brain raced

  shes somewhere down in the back of this
building ive got to know where we stand
before the third men question her tomorrow
im going to try secretly to find her tonight
he started toward the door of the room
iva clung a moment to his arm

  be careful kirk i feel there is terrible
peril here

 hammond could see none of the third
men in the corridor so he started out but at
once one of the machine-servants rolled
around a corner of the passage and con-
fronted him with its staring lens

  what are you wishes the thing asked
tonelessly if you desire to go anywhere i
will summon one of the masters

  kirk hammond turned and went back into
the room he had just left

  were practically prisoners he told iva
	startling stories

tautly they have those machine-servants
on guard outside

  iva looked more worried

  then these third men do not really trust
us at all

  and that makes me more determined to
find thayn before this thing goes further
hammond exclaimed the door is blocked
but-

 he went to the window the city vonn
now slumbered darkly beneath a night sky of
incredible splendor the heavens were
crowded with a glory of flaming suns such
as hammond had never before beheld here
at the heart of the great star-cluster the
night of the world althar was of a magni-
ficence unmatched elsewhere in the universe

  under that supernal glory of crowded stars
the great building that was the heart of the
third mens city seemed quiet he could see
only a few of the third men moving about
the nearby courts in which the plastic fliers
were kept

  im going down the wall hammond said
quickly help me fix a rope iva

  they tore strips from the cover of the pad
on the cot these were soon twisted together
into a rude serviceable rope hammond
thrust his energy-pistol deeper into his belt
then clambered over the sill of the window
iva leaned down face pale in the star-glow
he slid down to the ground then crouched in
the shadow and then his hand on his
weapon he crept along the shadow of the
wall

  hammond perceived a door in the wall
it opened and admitted him into a softly lit
passage he was in the rear part of the
ground floor of the building somewhere in
the maze of rooms back here thayn was
held

  but where how in the world can i find
her

  it began to appear impossible for him to
do so without being discovered there were
some of the third men moving in nearby
rooms and halls hammond realized dis-
covery was inevitable and he had an idea
that it might mean instant death he spent
a quarter-hour frantically trying one corri-
dor after another darting hastily back on
two occasions when he heard third men
approaching his deepest dread was of meet-
ing one of the machine-servants

  he had worked his way back still further
into the building when a door opened and
three of the tall third men came down the

passage hammond flattened himself back
quickly into a cross-corridor to his relief
the three men passed by

me heard their voices and with sudden
b  excitement recognized one of them as
mar kann

  -make your report at once to holl gor-
mon mar kann was saying as they passed
it is of the highest importance that we-
kirk hammond crouching with his
energy-pistol in his hand stiffened had mar
kann come from thayns prison it sounded
as though it might be so he decided to in-
vestigate and slipped down the hall to the
door whence they had come he could hear
no sound from within cautiously he opened
the door and peered inside

  the room was a lighted laboratory but
the mechanisms and instruments around it
were alien and unfamiliar to kirk ham-
monds eyes thayn marden sat fettered in
a high strange chair looking toward him
there were no other people in the room

  thayn he exclaimed starting forward
her eyes opened and then incredulity and
hope showed in her pale lovely face

  kirk look out she cried

  one of the machine-servants was rolling
forward from a corner of the room he had
overlooked it in his swift glance thinking it
merely another of the laboratorys mechan-
isms the mindless thing its lens turned to-
ward him spoke raspingly

  no intruders are allowed in the psycho-
logical department tonight under mar
kanns order retire at once

  the machine as it spoke raised a jointed
arm that held a lethal-looking cylinder
pointed straight at hammond hammond
tried to temporize surely a man could out-
wit a mere mechanical thing

  mar kann sent me he declared edging
a little nearer

  the rasping voice retorted instantly

  you will retire at once for you are not
mar kann nor one of the psychos
hammond turned as though to obey then
whirled with the energy-pistol in his hand
upraised he dared not fire lest the crash-
ing blast arouse all the building he tried to
knock the weapon from the machine-serv-
ants grasp the cylindrical weapon was
bolted to the jointed arm he discovered that
in dismay as his futile blow rebounded

  get on top of it kirk cried thayn in
warning hammond had leaped to avoid the
the star of life	

swing of that armed hand toward him he
had seized the jointed arm but could not
hold it

  desperately he heeded the vraman girls
cry and leaped up on top of the machine-
servants square box crouching on it he
hammered furiously with the muzzle of his
weapon at its lens-eye the pistol-barrel
smashed through the lens as the machine
rolled under him with universal-jointed arms
reaching up to seize him then suddenly the
arms stopped and the whole machine froze
motionless

  you have broken it thayn cried but
the two psychos who were here will soon be
back

  hammond quivering from the weirdness
of that fight scrambled off the lifeless thing
and went toward her her wide blue eyes
looked up at him her white face seeming
strange and drawn

 why did you come kirk

i couldnt leave you here in the hands of
your enemies he choked thayn i love you
-i know now i always have from the first
heartbreak showed in the depths of her
eyes her voice was an aching whisper
kirk i love you too but-

  he waited for no more he kissed her
ignoring the peril that brooded about them
her lips answered his with an almost desper-
ate passion and then her head drew back

  it is hopeless we vramen cannot love
anyone i thought that i never would i
thought i had forgotten all such emotions un-
til you came

  why is it hopeless thayn he demanded
passionately if we love each other what
can separate us

  a gulf wider than space and deeper than
time she said her eyes wet with tears

  but it is not time to think of ourselves
she exclaimed kirk your coming to althar
has precipitated an awful danger to my
people and to all the galaxy

  what do you mean he asked sharply
his own premonitions returning with re-
doubled force

  kirk the third men plan conquest not
only of althar but of the whole galaxy they
can achieve it for their science is far more
powerful than anything we vramen have

 until now we vramen have always
thwarted them by preventing their seizing
our ships and metal in our city sharanna
it was the barrier the fourth men gave us
that stopped them but now they have read

from my mind the nature of the barrier and
will be able to overcome it

         chapter xvi
         dread revelation

tild thoughts flashed through ham-
 w monds brain he felt a sharp dismay

  you mean theyve already searched your
mind but holl gormon said they wouldnt
until tomorrow

  holl gormon is only playing with you
hoomen using you as tools hell never let
your race become immortal he despises you
as lower than animals

  that confirmed kirk hammonds own im-
pression yet still he hesitated doubting

  you might be only trying to convince me
of this to save your own people keep your
own domination of the galaxy

  thayn maidens eyes became agonized in
their appeal

  kirk you must believe that i tell you
truth we vramen have never been tyrants
or oppressors to the hoomen of the galaxy
we have sought only to use our longer lives
and greater knowledge to lead them along
safe paths

  but the third men are different if they
conquer the galaxy they will institute a cold
scientific government in which hoomen and
vramen will be merely so many domestic
animals they will make all the galaxy an
unhuman efficient machine like this city
kirk hammond felt a chill horror at that
vision which matched so truly his own fore-
bodings

  yet still he hesitated

  i let you trick me once before into letting
you escape thayn if this is another trick-
thayn leaned forward her lips met his
kirk i love you you must believe that
i would not trick you now i seek only to
save vramen and hoomen alike from awful
disaster

  he made up his mind

  thayn i may be a triple fool but i be-
lieve you im going to help you escape to
warn your people

  hope sprang into thayns eyes

if we could get to sharanna with warning
the disaster might still somehow be averted
kirk hammonds mind was still dazed by
the whirl of events but he concentrated on
	startling stories

immediate problems

  those manacles that hold you to the
chair-how are we to get them off

  you will have to burn them off with your
energy-pistol thayn said quickly set the
power-stud on its side to the lowest notch
and put the muzzle against the fetters behind
the chair

  hammond obeyed he triggered and the
tiny crackling spurt of energy seared through
first one tough plastic fetter then the other
thayn sprang to her feet

  we must have a flier to get out of vonn
if we can get to the court where they are
kept-

  hammond hung back a moment thayn
what will happen to wilson and iva and my
friends i cant leave them in danger

  they are in no danger yet the vraman
girl insisted holl gormon plans to use
them as tools to help conquer sharanna and
later the outside galaxy the third men will
merely think you a traitor who helped me
escape for that is what lund and the others
will say

  and it may be true hammond said
doubtfully no i dont mean that i have no
more doubts of you thayn

  he went with her to the door and slid it
open mar kann and the two other third
men the psychos were coming down the
corridor

  mar kann stopped startled then with
superhuman speed of reaction he whipped
out a cylindrical weapon thayn had acted
a moment sooner she had snatched the
pencil-shaped shocker from kirk ham-
monds belt and leveled it the pale beam
of paralyzing electric force hit the third men
and dropped them in a heap just as one
opened his lips to cry out

  theres no time to lose now for theyll
soon be found exclaimed the vraman girl

  this way-i came through a door that
leads out into the courts hammond told
her swiftly they reached the door and
emerged into the shadow at the base of the
building

the supernal sky of flaming stars that
tented the city vonn cast its brilliant
glow down upon the paved courts they
could see the court in which the plastic fliers
rested thayn and hammond slipped along
the dividing walls and through the gate to-
ward those parked machines

  i think i can operate one of the fliers

the girl was whispering i observed closely
the method of operation when we were
brought here they appear to be propelled
by use of magnetic currents

 hammond had faith in her more-than-
human scientific abilities yet still it seemed
to him a desperate gamble they breathed in
relief when they saw that there were no
third men in the court behind them the
stark black mass of the great building hung
black and silent against the glorious stars
they had reached one of the fliers and thayn
was already climbing lithely into its cabin
when a rasping hatefully toneless voice
broke upon them

  state your identity and authorization it
demanded

  one of the machine-servants had rolled
silently up to them and confronted them with
a level cylinder hammond realized instant-
ly that there was no chance of overcoming
this mechanism as he had the one in the
laboratory

  state identity or you will be destroyed
rasped the thing

  its jointed arm moved slightly it was go-
ing to fire its weapon hammond ducked
as the cylinder buzzed there was no burst
of fire or energy or sound from it but the
body of the flier behind him suddenly
crumpled as though under a terrific blow

 hammond triggered his energy-pistol
desperately the crashing blast of fire from
the gun smacked into the machine-servant
and tore it into a wreck of fused plastic but
cries of alarm rose nearby

  thats done it hammond cried to the
vraman girl no chance of getting away
silently now

  he found her leaping unhurt out of the
wrecked flier she ran with him toward the
next vehicle hammond glimpsed machine-
servants rolling swiftly across the court and
third men bursting from doors in the great
building

  i have it thayn cried from the control
panel there was a whistling sound and the
flier screeched up into the night

  it rushed headlong rocking and dipping
across the black roofs of vonn then it was
beyond the city hurtling at rising speed
over the dark land beneath the flaring sky of
stars

  they will follow quickly thayn called
over her shoulder look back

 kirk hammond glanced swiftly behind
them and his heart sank shining specks
the star of life	

were rising from vonn in the star-glow and
rushing on their track as minutes passed
their flier attained a speed that made the
walls of the cabin hot with friction they
were flying low over the great moss-forests
in a northeastward direction but the fliers
of the third men seemed remorselessly to
shorten the distance between them though
they were still far behind

  they know the operation of these fliers
better than i do and will overtake us long
before we can reach sharanna thayn told
him

  she tried changing course veering sharply
in one or another direction to confuse their
pursuers but always the shining specks re-
appeared behind them each time a little
closer

  as i feared they have locator equipment
which automatically finds our position for
them she murmured we shall have to
risk a desperate expedient or both of us will
be destroyed very quickly

 hammond did not understand

 what do you plan to do

  she was peering tensely ahead

  black lake should not be far from here
if we can make the third men think weve
perished-

 the starlit forest of great moss-clumps
continued to unreel beneath them with ap-
palling speed then far ahead a dark glint
of starlit water broke the vista of the weird
forest

 thats black lake thayn exclaimed
take my hand and prepare to jump when i
do open the cabin door

it seemed suicidal to kirk hammond
but he felt that he had no other alterna-
tive thayn suddenly slowed the flier down
to a mere fraction of its former velocity
they were almost brushing the tops of the
moss-clumps in this slowed flight

 now she cried and threw herself out
of the cabin door with him

 hammond expected a violent shock when
they hit the ground but they did not hit
it instead he and thayn plunged from the
flier into a huge soft yielding mass it was
one of the great moss-clumps thayn had
accurately estimated the exact moment of
jumping so as to land in one of them

  as they rolled in the big soft mass the
empty flier was speeding onward out over
the dark waters of the lake

  an instant later the pursuing fliers of the

third men rocketed by overhead at their
far greater speed they almost at once over-
took the unoccupied machine out over the
lake there was no sound or sight of weapons
being used but the empty flier suddenly was
smashed into a wreck of broken plastic that
plummeted down and disappeared with a
splash into the dark water

  they will think we were still in it thayn
whispered crouching down with hammond
in the moss unless they have suspected
those weapons they use have titanic
power she added thoughtfully i think
that they too make use of magnetic force
the third mens fliers circled for some
minutes over the spot where the wreckage
had sunk then as though satisfied that
none had survived the wreck they turned
and raced back southward toward vonn

  we have escaped them thayn said with
relief then in the star-glaw he saw her
face fall but we are still very far from
sharanna and have no means of travel but
on foot

  he helped her climb down from the huge
clump of moss when they reached the
ground thayn started without hesitation
in a northeasterly direction

  we must skirt the lake and then strike
straight north for the mountains she said
sharanna is high in their peaks

  it was weird walking through the star-lit
moss-forests of althar the canopy of brilli-
ant suns overhead struck shafts of glowing
silver light down through the great clumps
and there were deep shadows black lake
lapped and sucked gently along the shore
they followed there were still no signs of
animals or birds

 the speed with which thayn marden
hurried was proof of the desperate urgency
she felt

  we are many hours travel from sharanna
and time is short before the fate of althar
and the galaxy will be decided

 surely it will take the third men a
long time to prepare an attack on your
vramen city hammond asked

 they have been prepared for such an
attack for ages thayn exclaimed all
that held them from it was the barrier they
could not pass for the barrier is a machine
given us by the fourth men which throws
a shield of vibration all around our whole
city sharanna

  that vibration is exactly tuned to the
brain structure of the third men we
	startling stories

vramen can pass it as you hoomen could
but the vibration is so adjusted to the
neuronic pattern of the third mens brains
that it literally shakes their brains into
madness if they enter it

  but now they have learned much about
the machine from me not about its inmost
principles-i cannot understand the strange
science of the fourth men-but enough clues
about its operation so that they can devise
protection from it even now holl gormon
will have his scientists working on such pro-
tection and once they have it theyll go out
into the galaxy

 kirk hammond again felt the ghastly
impact of that vision of the cold-eyed ruth-
less third men fastening tyranny on the
galaxy

 thayn who are the third men and
where did they come from what is the
secret of all these strange warring human
races on althar

  thayn mardens white face was tragic in
the star-glow as she answered him

 the third men are the chldren of my
people-the children of the vramen

          chapter xvii
          in the sky city

kirk hammond was so stunned by
the unbelievable assertion that he
stopped and stared blankly at the girl thayn
spoke swiftly trying to convince him yet
seeming at the same time to tell the thing
reluctantly

  it is true that is why they have their
name the hoomen are the first men the
first human species we vramen are the
second men these people are the third
men and there is a fourth human species
too

  it began four thousand years ago when
a few hooman scientists exploring this clus-
ter came first to this star of life and its
world they landed here on althar and the
unique hard radiation of the star so affected
every cell in their bodies as to make them
immortal they were thus the first vramen

  at first those first vramen saw no draw-
back to their immortality they brought
some other hoomen here to althar so that
they also could become immortal they
built sharanna in the northern mountains

and planned to change the whole hooman
race into vramen in time

  but then came the dreadful revelation
children began to be born to those first
vramen in sharanna and the children
were not like either the hoomen or the
vramen they were a totally new human
species large in stature twelve-fingered
colossal in mental power-the third men

  then the vramen realized that this world
of immortality was a dreadful baited trap
the radiation of the star of life gave immor-
tality yes but also it affected the chromo-
somes the cells of heredity in the human
bodies it made immortal it caused an evo-
lutionary mutation in the human stock

  it might have been forseen had not elation
over immortality prevented hard radiation
has always had the power so to shift the
genes in the chromosome cells as to cause
sudden evolutionary mutations that was
what had happened to the vramen

  the vramen at first clung to hope that
these children of theirs this new human
species they had fathered would prove
godlike and admirable but as the third
men grew up that hope faded they were
too alien a species

  the too-sudden burst of evolutionary
change had given them vast mental and
physical development at the expense of
spiritual development the third men wished
to seize the whole galaxy establish them-
selves as utterly unchallenged rulers and
treat vramen and hoomen alike as inferior
species of no great intelligence

  the vramen refused this ghastly plan
and when the third men who were still
only half-grown tried to use force their
parents succeeded in repelling their attempt
so all the third men totally devoid of any-
thing like filial emotion left sharanna and
established the new city vonn there when
they reached maturity their scientific powers
grew greatly as the centuries of their im-
mortal lives passed

 they would have come back then and
conquered their parents had they not been
upset by a strange new turn of events the
mature third men in their new city vonn
had intermarried and children had been born
to them the same power of the rays that
had caused the first mutation now caused
another the children of the third men
were not like their parents at all they were
still another new species-the fourth men

  these fourth men were totally different
the star

from the third men their brain-cases were
huger than in any humans so far but their
bodies were disparate they were over-
specialized in regard to mind and had no
capacity or inclination for any life of action
they desired only a life of thought

  their progenitors the third men had de-
liberately planned to let this new species be
born so that they could utilize its greater
mental powers for their own purposes but
the fourth men hating action and ambition
would not let themselves be so used

  they repeated history by deserting their
parents and going off to found a strange
underground city on the other side of this
planet there they have dwelt ever since
engaged in the pure thought-research which
is their purpose in life

  kirk hammond was stunned by this epic
history of mutations running wild with the
human stock in this world of immortality

 and did the fourth men then produce
still another human mutation he asked

  no for the fourth men are sterile they
are the end-products of human evolution in
this world but since like us and the third
men they are immortal they have lived on
ever since

 but they seem to have intervened to
help you protect the vramen from holl
gormons people hammond said wonder-
ingly

hayn nodded

 that was because the fourth men
hate war and turmoil to rage on althar to
prevent it they gave us the barrier so that
the third men would not be able to attack
us

  i think our only real hope now is to get
the fourth men to help us again with their
wondrous science before the third men
attack but i feel worried that they may
not do so for they so despise action that
they may not wish to become embroiled at
all

  and this is the story that you vramen
didnt want the hoomen in the galaxy ever
to know cried kirk hammond

  thayn nodded somberly

  we didnt want it known for we felt that
the hoomen would look on us as monstrous
freaks if they knew of the mutation and
would completely reject our leadership

 thayn youre crazy hammond said
forcefully its only some inferiority complex
bom of your change that has made you

of life	

vramen think that im certain the hoomen
wouldnt feel so

  thayn stopped and looked at him her
white face earnest in the brilliant star-glow

  do you feel so toward me now that you
know what different species i belong to
kirk hammond

  of course not he exclaimed and took
her in his arms thayn i love you and all
that makes no difference

  she broke from his grasp sobbing

  you refuse to understand no vraman
can marry that is because the children of
vramen would only be third men that is
why we forswear love and marriage when
we accept immortality

  i made that vow of renunciation four
hundred years ago when i was a youthful
scientist and i knew what it entailed the
vramen who invited me to become one of
their caste made all clear to me

  they told me you will live loveless and
lonely all your life and your life will be
unthinkable centuries long your only re-
ward will be consciousness that you are
serving the whole of humanity and i
agreed and came to althar with them and
became immortal under the star of life

  i thought i had forgotten love completely
until that night on earth in the hoomens
refuge there when i pretended love to
trick you into letting me go i suddenly
found that the trick was on myself and that
i really loved you

  then nothing is going to part us we can
work out this problem somehow kirk
hammond told her determinedly

  thayn shook her head

  there is no solution we belong to differ-
ent species and that is a gulf wider than
space and deeper than time as i told you
but as they started forward again through
the moss-forest he reached out and took
her hand

  dont think of it now thayn there must
be some way out for us

  it is only day-dreaming to think so she
said a catch in her voice but day-dream-
ing can be sweet

  her slim fingers tightened on his

  the strangeness of it you from old
earth in the forgotten past i from the vra-
men since four hundred years ago walking
here under althars stars like lovers

  for hours they traveled northward through
the moss-forests at last the glorious sky of
stars began to pale in the east an opalescent
	startling stories

glory shot over the horizon scintillating
with all its uncanny splendor the star of
life rose to cast its brillance over althar

  a little later they reached the end of the
forest before them grassy higher ground
sloped up into the rocky foothills of sky-
storming blue peaks high in those peaks
brooded a weird deep rosy glow

  that glow far up there is the barrier
and inside it lies sharanna thayn told
him we had better rest before we go on
hammond sensed that she needed the rest
far less than he for he was aware of the
vramens inexhaustible strength and resil-
ience looking at her blond hair and clear
profile as they sat in the shadow of a moss-
clump kirk hammond could not reconcile
himself to the thought that she was not
human in the usual sense

all the hours they had walked his
bewildered mind had struggled with
that problem and always as now he came
back to the firm resolve that no difference
would separate him from her

  thayn ive been thinking he said sud-
denly if i were to take off the ray-proof
garment beneath my clothes the rays of the
star would make me-like you we could
always be together then

  horror showed in thayns eyes

  no kirk you must never do that for
though you would become one of the vramen
we still could never marry and you would
be condemned to the endless barren monot-
ony of immortality that has been my lot
her hands gripped his shoulders in appeal
you do not know how terrible it can be to
live on in loveless lonely life for century
after century seeing ordinary humans grow
up and marry and father children and then
die and rest while you never change i will
not let you share that fate

 hammond was shaken

  it seems that you vramen have made a
terrible sacrifice for the rest of humanity and
one that has not been appreciated

  she shook her head

  the hoomen simply do not understand
they resent us for not letting them become
immortal and we cant tell them the truth
for if we did they would reject us as human
freaks

  i still think you are wrong about that
kirk hammond told her anyway well
talk about it again

  he had reached a determination that even

if all else were denied him he would at
least share thayns fate they started again
climbing the rugged foothills and then toiling
up the steep and rocky slopes of the enor-
mous mountains

  by mid-afternoon they were still far from
the lofty plateau above on which the vramen
had built their city the day was waning by
the time they reached the edge of the barrier
in the gathering dusk the rosy glow brooded
for many miles over the peaks thayn led
him straight into that strange roseate aura

  i cant feel anything at all hammond
said wonderingly

  as i told you the vibration of the barrier
is tuned to affect only the brains of the
third men she answered because they
are a different species from us vramen or
hoomen the neuronic structure of their
brains is radically different from that of
ours

  if you were a third man the vibration
would at this moment be setting off a
shrieking madness in your brain but be-
cause you are a hooman it does not harm
you in the least

 hammond was near exhaustion and his
heart sank as he looked up through the eery
glow toward the heights still above them

  weve miles to go yet and it will soon be
night itll take us many hours yet

  thayn shook her head

  no kirk the barrier automatically gives
alarm in sharanna when anyone enters it
my people will investigate

  only a few minutes after she spoke there
rushed down the roseate glow the slim shapes
of four vraman fliers they landed on the
slope close by armed vramen shining
handsome men pouring out of the craft

 thayn marden exclaimed one we
feared you lost in space when you failed to
arrive in sharanna after your telaudio mes-
sage then stiffening the speaker exclaim-
ed who is this hooman

  no time for explanations here thayn
said swiftly i bring news of danger we
must see the elders at once

  a few minutes later saw them in one of
the fliers rushing steeply up through the
pulsing rosy radiance

they soared up over the peaks kirk
hammond looked down and saw a small
plateau upon which arose a city of wondrous
beauty

  it was an elfin city of pure white streets
the star of life	

and towers and domes laced with flowering
green gardens the alabaster spires that
rose like frozen music the graceful high-
flung bridges that linked upper levels of
many structures the deep rosy glow that
enveloped it-these gave an unreal fairy
beauty to sharanna of the vramen

  the fliers dived toward a central circular
white plaza as they landed hammond per-
ceived that at the center of this space was
the enigmatic object from which the rosy
glow appeared to emanate it was a big dull-
silver ball thirty feet in diameter

  thayn read his thoughts

  yes that is the apparatus that emits the
vibration of the barrier even we know little
of what is inside it for the fourth men built
it and brought it here

  kirk hammond was so drugged by weari-
ness that as he followed the girl into a
towering building he was hardly aware of
the excited vramen and women gathering
about them inside the building in a lofty
white hall illuminated by shimmering light
two vramen came to meet them both had
the look of men past middle age one a tall
spare man the other stocky and bearded

  these are the two leaders of our elders
thayn said to him quickly they are the
men who first found the star of life long
ago-smith rymer and bror gormon

 the tall thin vraman named rymer
glanced swiftly at kirk hammond and then
turned a stern glance on the girl

  you bring a hooman here to sharanna
what is the meaning of this thayn

  danger the most terrible that has ever
threatened us thayn marden exclaimed
danger from the third men

  she talked swiftly and as they heard her
rapid explanations the faces of rymer and
gormon grew grave

  the peril is great indeed muttered smith
rymer the scientists of the third men have
great powers with the clues gained from
your mind theyll surely soon be able to
devise a counter to the barrier and once
they do theyll sweep down through it onto
sharanna

  his thin face set in decision

  there is but one possible hope of repel-
ling that attack when it comes we must
ask the aid of the fourth men

 bror gormon gestured toward hammond
 what of the hooman

  rymers eyes rested on him a moment
  he did great wrong to help the others

come to althar but he redeemed that by
aiding thayn to escape and bring us warning
we will accept him

  come with me he added urgently we
must not lose a moment in informing the
fourth men of the peril

  hammond and thayn followed the two
elders across the shimmering hall and down-
stairs to a massive locked dooor smith
rymer produced a tiny tube which he press-
ed against the lock of the door a bead of
light winked and the lock clicked open the
room inside was small the only object in it
was an apparatus that looked much like an
ordinary telaudio set

  when the fourth men gave us the barrier
for protection rymer explained they left
us this apparatus by which we might call
them if the barrier ever failed i only hope
that they will answer

as rymer seated himself in front of the
screen of the apparatus and touched
its switches hammond looked wonderingly
at bror gormon

  you two were among the first to find the
star of life thayn says but that first
discovery was four thousand years ago
the stocky bearded gormon nodded

  we have lived ever since we are the
oldest of the vramen

  hammond shook his head

  it seems incredible and it seems strange
too that your name is the same as that of
the third mens director

  the vramans bearded face grew somber
that is not strange for holl gormon
the leader of the third men is my own son
only then did kirk hammond remember
that the third men were the children of the
first vramen in bror gormons somber
face he read the deep tragedy that had re-
sulted from the appalling mutations of hu-
manity on this world

  rymer uttered a little exclamation

  at last ive reached them

  on the screen of the telaudio a scene had
appeared kirk knew that it was a scene in
the legendary underground city of the
fourth men on the other side of the planet

  it was a huge square subterranean cham-
ber with burnished silver walls pallidly il-
luminated by a sourceless glow at its center
was a colossal mass of interlinked wiring
tubes recorders and other unfamiliar ap-
paratus of incredible complexity

  corridors branched from that room in all
	startling stories

directions like the spokes of a wheel along
the corridors were many small cell-like
rooms each closed by a transparent door
in each cell as though in coma sat a single
figure

  those are the fourth men murmured
smith rymer they engage in tremendous
projects of joint thought-research by some-
how correlating their minds through that
big mass of apparatus you see

  kirk hammond stared unbelievingly into
the screen at the creatures he could glimpse
sitting unmoving in those little cells the
fourth men the final awesome mutation
of men who had evolved too fast and too far

          battle and death

now kirk hammond felt mixed emo-
tions these creatures who were the
end-product of human evolution on althar
were both glorious and pitiful they were no
more than three feet high their bodies were
the pitifully thin frail bodies of undernour-
ished children

  but their heads were enormous bobbing
on their thin necks as though too heavy for
them bald with enormous bulging cran-
iums the great luminous eyes and tiny nose
and baby-like mouths gave them weirdness

  one of the fourth men came into view
walking toward the screen he peered at
them with an expression of irritation

  what is the meaning of this untimely
call he demanded in a piping voice you
have interrupted our thought-research at a
most delicate point we are extrapolating
the past history of the cosmos beyond the
pre-nebular period and this is a serious
disturbance of our work

  we would not have called if it had not
been urgent awlo kal said rymer quickly
there is imminent danger of terrible con-
flict

  awlo kal the fourth man listened im-
patiently but his expresssion changed slightly
when he heard smith rymers swift story

  this is most upsetting he declared the
third men will upset all althar with their
ignorant childish desire for physical con-
quest

  theyll surely soon find a way to get
through the barrier rymer said cant

you help us somehow to repel them

  kirk hammond added hopefully surely
with your science you fourth men can de-
vise a way to destroy them when they
come

  destroy them repeated awlo kal in-
credulously what kind of primitive savage
person is that who suggests that we destroy
the third men we would not dream of
killing them or any other living thing

  all that is necessary is to remove the
desire for conquest from the minds of the
third men that could be done i think
by rearranging the synaptic patterns of their
brains so as to introduce schizophrenic
doubts of themselves into their minds

  it sounded hopelessly far-fetched to kirk
hammond but the vramen appeared to
take the suggestion with complete serious-
ness

  you will prepare a weapon for that pur-
pose at once the third mens scientists
will surely solve the barrier in a few days
said smith rymer anxiously

  yes yes we will prepare the simple ap-
paratus necessary for the purpose and bring
it to sharanna in time never fear was the
reply of awlo kal it will not take long
for a few of us to accomplish that

  and without any word of farewell the
fourth man switched off his own telaudio
and the screen went dark hammond looked
anxiously at the vramen

  they cant deal with the third men by
psychological weapons when the whole
galaxy is in danger

  the psychological science of the fourth
men is very great and they can do what they
say rymer assured he added anxiously
i only hope that they will do it in time
kirk hammond shook his head

  it will surely take them a long time to
prepare such a subtle weapon and also it
will take them time to get here with it if their
citys on the other side of althar

 the fourth men can come almost in-
stantaneously when theyre ready thayn
marden told him they have a method of
transposing space by rotating sections of it
around an axis in another dimension

  but smith rymer still looked grave

  the only danger is that they will be
so engrossed in their endless thought-re-
search that they will forget about it

  his thin face hardened in decision

  well make ready every weapon of our
own that we can and also well set an atomic
the star of life



fuse to our supplies of copper here in the
last extremity well destroy sharanna and
all in it rather than let the third men carry
conquest out into the galaxy

  kirk hammond found himself reeling with
fatigue as they returned to the upper level
of the building thayn insisted upon his
sleeping he tried to resist but when he
fell upon a couch in the upper chamber to
which she led him he sank immediately into
exhausted slumber

  he awoke with a sensation that many
hours had passed when he opened his eyes
he saw through the window opposite his
couch that the sky was darkening to night
again hammond turned his head and found
that thayn marden was sitting by his couch
and watching his face with a strange intent-
ness

  you have slept long she said softly
for hours my people have been busy and
they are still preparing weapons

she rose as hammond walked over to
her her brilliant blue eyes looked up
at him yearningly as he put his arms around
her

  no kirk-

  but her lips clung to his when he kissed
her a heartbeat of time that he would never
forget

  thayn thayn he whispered

  sudden sirens shrieking the scream of a
lost soul echoed through the city and tore
them apart

  that is the alarm thayn cried face
white but there can be no attack so soon
they raced down to the lower floor of the
big building smith rymer and bror gormon
were there and rymer was speaking rapidly
to a gathering group of taut-faced vramen

  our radiolocators show a great fleet of
fliers approaching from the south it can
only be the third men coming 

  but they cant have devised a counter
to the barrier as soon as this thayn cried
even their scientists could not do that
it seems so to me and it may only be
feint but we cannot take chances rymer
replied every man and women to his
defensive position

  sharanna was in uproar when thayn and
kirk hammond emerged into the central
plaza under the rosy glow of the barrier
men and women were running to the big
energy-guns that had been mounted at
strategic locations during the day

  i am going to call awlo kal rymer
said tensely this may only be a feint but
we cannot be sure

  hammond grew taut in every nerve with
awareness that the third men with their
stupendous weapons were rushing ever closer
through the night the plaza now was almost
deserted the vramen speeding to their de-
fensive posts around it and in the city be-
yond

  i must go too kirk thayn said quickly
you stay with the elders-

  i stay with you he flashed now and
in the future

  she grasped his arm

  then come

  they started across the plaza and then
an incredible event exploded upon them
down through the rosy glow of the barrier
swept six black plastic fliers-craft of the
third men thayn marden cried out in-
credulously as those grim black shapes
swooped down

  they have come through the barrier
but how-

  things happened with split-second speed
the fliers had flashed to a landing in the
plaza from them emerged men armed with
big energy-guns who ran toward the big
silver sphere of the barrier machine

  but they were not third men the mem-
bers of this sudden raiding party they
were hoomen hammond suddenly recog-
nized their faces

  jon wilson and lund and the others he
yelled so thats the way the third men
are striking

  he saw it all in a flash hoomen could
pass the barrier without harm the third
men would have read that fact from thayns
mind so they were sending in wilson and
his band to destroy the barrier mechanism
and open the way for holl gormon and his
hordes

  wilson wait cried hammond running
forward dont destroy that machine you
dont know what youre doing-the third
men are tricking you

  some of the hoomen swung around start-
led among them was big rab quobba

  its hammond cried the vegan boys
wed better wait until he tells us-

  but gurth lund interrupted his energy-
gun leveled at kirk hammond his face
raging and deadly

  i knew he was a traitor and his being
here with the vramen proves it
	startling stories

lund fired as he spoke the thin crack-
ling bolt of fiery energy darting at
hammond thayn at that same instant
plunged to knock hammond out of the
blasts path then she reeled as the crack-
ling bolt of fire struck her body

  destroy the barrier machine jon wil-
sons voice was yelling the vramen are
coming

  kirk hammond as he got to his feet saw
streams of fire from the weapons of wilson
and others tear into the great silver sphere
the big sphere cracked split and fused
abruptly the deep rosy glow that brooded
over the city vanished like a turned-off
light from the frantic vramen running out
onto the plaza came a hoarse hopeless yell

  the barrier is down

  kirk hammond was bending wildly over
thayn a deep wound in her white side
gaped black and scorched

  thayn he cried huskily you shouldnt
have done it

  her eyes were closed her face white
behind him energy-guns were crackling as
the vramen poured in around wilsons band
but he paid no attention

  a wild voice shouted in hammonds ear
and he turned to look dazedly into iva
wilsons bloodless face

  kirk i tried to tell them not to carry
out the third mens plan she was sobbing
i even insisted on coming with them hoping
to persuade them-

  her voice trailed off as she saw thayn
mardens face

  is she dead

  no and shell live-shes got to live
kirk exclaimed hoarsely

  the scuffle of battle behind him had ended
he turned to find that the vramen had
overpowered the hoomen raiders wilsons
band had surrendered to the overpowering
odds

  you can kill us but itll do you no good
now jon wilson flared the third men
are coming

  you fool youve brought disaster not
only on the vramen but also on your own
people and all the galaxy thundered bror
gormon

  hold them in the tower yonder he or-
dered and tell them what they have done
so they may know the bitter truth before
we all perish

  a vraman came running to him

  the fliers of the third men are coming

down on us now he pointed up into the
southern starry sky

  every man to the defense shouted bror
gormon we may have no hope but if we
die the third men will go with us

  ill take care of thayn kirk iva ex-
claimed to kirk hammond they are com-
ing

  hundred of fliers were sweeping down out
of the blazing star-decked heavens already
energy-guns throughout the city were sav-
agely blasting up at them with leaping
tongues of fire

  but the third men landed their fliers
along the widest street and poured forth in
a solid mass they carried their cylindrical
magnetic weapons bolts of invisible terrible
force smashed paths of death through the
vramen defenders who crowded to meet the
attack

  kirk hammond rage and anguish in his
soul was in the forefront of those defenders
his energy-pistol spat fire as men on either
side of him were smitten to rags by the
unseen bolts of force

  this defense could not last long the
magnetic weapons of the third men were
too stupendous in power and range and
the fourth men had not come in time the
end would be the atomic explosion to destroy
everything under the brilliant star-glow
sharanna was in the death-throes ham-
mond saw holl gormons cold face back in
the mass of the attackers and heard his
shout

  sweep them out of the way and get to
the underground cooper-stores at once

  he knew that holl gormon had accurately
forseen the desperate final stratagem that
the vramen would adopt he shot in fierce
effort to destroy the man knowing that he
was himself teetering on the brink of eternity

  behind us suddenly screamed one of
the third men look-

 kirk hammond saw the same incredible
spectacle that had brought that screech of
startled fear

in the street beyond the mass of attack-
ers there had suddenly appeared as
though by sheer magic a square metal plat-
form on which were a dozen small human
figures and a big multi-muzzled apparatus

 the fourth men yelled a hundred
voices among the invaders

  it was they hammond saw it was awlo
kal and a half-score of his comrades who
the star of life	

had come in answer to rymers call-had
come with the suddenness of thought by
that strange method of space transposition
that annihilated all distance and now they
were turning their apparatus or weapon
upon the mass of the third men

  a fine violet spray of light like a powerful
electric brush shot out from the multiple
muzzles of their apparatus and swept back
and forth over the mass of holl gormons
followers

 hammond still could not believe in that
strange-looking weapon stop this ravening
army of attackers simply by altering their
minds and sapping the foundations of their
desire of conquest win this titanic struggle
merely by inducing artificial schizophrenia

  destroy them before they overpower us
holl gormon was shouting furiously they
are human they can be killed

 but the third men had stopped fighting
were looking at each other confusedly then
staring around them in sudden timidity that
timidity rushed into panic the third men
began to drop their weapons to stumble back
to their fliers and their leader was among
them as the fine violet spray swept over him
also within a brief interval every one of the
attackers had fled out of sharanna in panic
haste

 smith rymer stood beside hammond his
face quivering

  they will never come back those schizo-
phrenic fissions caused in their brains
synaptic patterns will forever keep them too
timid too doubtful of their own abilities to
seek conquest

 awlo kal the little fourth man on the
platform nodded his huge head

  that is so there will be permanent peace
now on althar and we will no longer be
interrupted in our researches we hope

 the fourth man made a signal the plat-
form abruptly vanished as the space-trans-
position method was again employed-
then weve saved sharanna and our peo-
ple and all the hoomen outside breathed
bror gormon and-and i did not have to
kill my son

 hammond clutched at smith rymers arm
what of thayn

 rymer shook his head sadly

  she is dying

 cant your science somehow save her
he cried

 not even an immortal body can survive
such an injury she would have been dead

already had she been a hooman

  kirk hammond went numbly with them
to the tower of the elders where thayn had
been taken jon wilson and the other hoo-
men met him inside it wilsons gaunt face
was trembling with emotion

  the vramen told us the whole story
hammond we know now why they wouldnt
give us immortality but no hooman would
want it at that dreadful price

  thank heaven i so suspected the full
effect of the rays that i prevailed on wilson
and the others to keep their rayproof body-
shields on until we were more sure old
thol orr put in

  but why didnt the vramen tell us be-
fore cried wilson then we wouldnt
have resented their immortality or hated
them

  thayn marden spoke in a whisper from the
couch on which she lay

  then you dont think us unhuman muta-
tional freaks now that you know the truth
about us

  wilson answered her chokingly

  we think you men and women have sacri-
ficed everything to lead and help our civiliza-
tion and all hoomen will think so when
they know the truth

  if that is so said smith rymer with
deep emotion then the old hostility between
hoomen and vramen has ended now for-
ever

  it is as you said kirk whispered thayn
incredulously we should have told them
long ago

kirk hammond felt blinding tears
in his eyes as he bent over her and
gathered her shattered body in his arms
her voice was a faint murmur in his ear
dont grieve rest will be sweet to me
and we could never have had a future to-
gether but-but i am glad that one night
at least we walked like lovers in the star-
light-

  her whisper choked and faded and he
knew that the fife had gone out of her


  later standing outside and looking with
blind unseeing eyes across the silent white
city at the dawn kirk hammond heard
lund and quobba slowly approach him
gurth lunds face was white and working
as he extended an energy-pistol hilt fore-

chapter i
journey into chaos

ii

ello hello
hello-chris
do you hear
me-hello hello hello
arnim penger slammed
down the tele-talker and
turned to his companion
no answer yet

  its queer all right
mr penger but whats
there to worry about
we got mr bells mes-
sage that he was back
from his exploratory trip hours ago and
theres nothing could happen to him at the
post is there he wasnt to start trading
until tomorrow so he must have had his
curtain charged and no venusians in the
enclosure besides theyre a pretty harmless
lot anyway

  the veteran trader shrugged his broad
shoulders nothing much could happen to
him i suppose but this is the first time
communication has failed he fell silent
but there was a brooding light in his steel-
gray eyes and a tense grimness about his
fine bronzed features

  he stared unseeingly at the great pile of
clotted spider web that filled half the trading
room of the little post a cool half million
that accumulated result of half an earth
years dickering with the natives was
worth and all it had cost venus mines
inc were some bushels of brightly colored
beads and glittering gew-gaws dear to the
savage heart

  theres a mitco post about some miles the
other side of bells post he mused aloud

  britt haldane turned from his contempla-
tion of the grey bleached jungle the dense
light-shot ceiling the sheeted torrents of the
typical venusian landscape

  i say you dont think theres any chance
of trouble from the martians

  penger shot a quick glance at the fresh-
colored youngster with the starry blue eyes
and the tow hair that persisted in falling
over his forehead this eighteen-year-old
lad brought back memories of the time two
decades past when he himself was taking
over his first station on jupiter

  those were unregenerate days with the
board of planetary control yet unborn and
life made zestful by the continuous guerilla
warfare with the forces of mitco the great
martian interstellar trading company the
earth companys only rival

  no not much chance he drawled in
reply to the lads question theyd hardly
challenge the b p cs wrath and yet if
the stakes were great enough    he
sighed unaccountably i suppose im just
fed up on these eternal rains ill be glad
enought to get back to earth when the relief
ship comes and leave you here

britt and arnim curiously light stepped into outer space through the airlock

  gosh i can hardly wait to take over to
be a real venus trader at last in charge of
my own station he saw the older mans
amused smile and added hastily of course
it isnt that i want to see you go but-you
know how is it

  arnim nodded

  yes i know how it is i felt the same way
when i took over my first asignment it sure
was a kick two days later i was crouched
behind a barricade of ice blocks taking pot
shots at a bunch of martians who were doing
their darnedest to exterminate me and a
couple of other earthmen and grab off the
richest jovium mine on jupiter for mitco

  there were no interplanetary filing laws
then no taking a bunch of papers over to the
office on ganymede and thereafter being
protected by the mercurian patrol ships with
their zeta-ray projectors

  you took what you could get and held
it by the power of your own guns

    the youths eyes glowed

    it must have been great wish id been
 in the game then

    you werent born then young fellow
 pengers eyes wandered past the lad to the
 teeming landscape revealed by the open
 door

    hello i dont like that coppery tinge
 to the clouds down on the horizon looks
 as if were going to have a taste of one of the
 electrical storms old venus favors us with
 once in a blue moon

    get out in one of those and youll be
 ready to give up darn quick even the natives
 scurry to their caves when one of the big
 ones is on a rampage

   his eyes narrowed as he gazed out the
 dripping jungle pressed its greyness close
 up against the interlacing net of copper fila-
 ments that was the curtain the apparently
 frail barrier around the liquid mud clearing
 of this outpost of earths commerce


	startling stories

e rom the low ceiling of dun clouds

	poured a torrent of warm rain that might
dwindle to a drizzle or increase to a devas-
tating downpour but which never for a
moments ceased far away the clouds were
suffused with a reddish ominous glare

  come on he said at last as he sealed the
door works over for another twelve hours
start the drying machine and well get
comfortable then ill try to get chris again
if he hadnt borrowed the wanderer for that
trip of his id be tempted to hop over and
find out whats up

  haldane obediently swung over the lever
of the artificial atmosphere machine that re-
produced earth condition for the traders
during the rest-periods as the air dried
the two stripped off the sodden working
suits britt stretched himself luxuriously as
the moisture was sucked from the bronzed
skin of his body

  this is a little bit of all right let it storm
for all i care

  penger looked estimatingly at the young
fellow was he going to stand the gaff he
wondered alone with the treacherous
natives and the eternal rains and the hor-
rible loneliness the loneliness-that was it
would this fresh-faced eager youth break
under the strain of the long months with no
one of his own kind to talk to to look at
well chris bell would be only a few miles
away that reminded him he still hadnt
got through to old chris he turned the
transmitter

  but as he did so there was a crash and
the neon lights went out their cold white
light was replaced by a blinding blue glare
as the outer world was illumined by a tre-
mendous lightning flash then it was pitch
dark as over the muttering rumble of the
diminishing growl and the pound of the
torrential rain on the roof came the high
whining signal of the field receiver

  arnim sprang to the instrument unerring-
ly his fingers sought and found the switch
and thrust it home out of the blackness a
voice sounded a precise clipped english
voice yet strained and urgent shot through
with pain and exhaustion

  penger arnim penger are you there
penger penger help penger

  arnim snatched up the transmitter

  chris chris im listening its arnim
penger whats the matter quick man
whats happened to you

  the far-off disembodied voice seemed to
be dying out

 arnim thank god-you answered at
last its hours help-help he-e-lp it
died out to a whisper then abruptly it was
gone

 chris whats the matter what hap-

pened the trader was shouting into the
transmitter but only the rattle of the rain-
drops and a crash of thunder answered

  the lights came on haldane was standing
just behind him white-faced penger gazed
at him unseeing his eyes steely flames his
great fists clenched

  britt he snapped take over he went
out in the anteroom struggled into a fresh
suit of corduroys pulled on his banta water-
proof

  as his face appeared out of the black folds
it was set grim

  if you dont hear from me by the time the
relief ship gets here have em send a force
over to bells post no trading heaven
knows what the venusians are up to he
was strapping on the high mud-shoes

  britt came out of his daze in a tumbling
rush he fairly stuttered in his eagerness

  i say you cant do that-i mean you cant
go alone ill go with you-otherwise-good
lord you know what i mean he fell into
a sudden silence but his eyes pleaded for
him

  penger shot one glance at him

  youll do he said laconically hop into
your clothes

  haldane blushed with pleasure at the vet-
erans endorsement even as he dived hastily
into his clothing arnim stood in the door-
way waiting impatiently the younger man
snapped the elastic of his respirator-mask
over his head settled his hood down over
the goggled eyepieces

  im ready sir the mouthpiece of the
mask muffled his tones strangely

  they were outside in a world gone mad
from black clouds that seemed not fifty feet
over their heads forked lightning shot in-
cessantly shot and stabbed at them as if the
elements themselves had risen in wrath to
oust these beings from an alien world to
the continuous roll of thunder was added the
crash of the nearly solid sheets of water that
beat down upon the earthmen strangling
them despite their masks striving to drive
them into the viscid mud that oozed fluid
beneath their wide-spreading mud-shoes

  in the flickering blue light beyond the
curtain the tall ferns were flattened down
over the tangle of writhing vines and lush
wire-grass till the thicket seemed a solid
mass compressed by the weight of tons of
water lashed by a wind of hurricane force

  haldane gasped and paled even penger
veteran though he was hesitated for an in-
stant it was the height of insanity to dare
the long journey in this chaos no one could
live through it but then he remembered
that call coming eerily out of the darkness

  help penger help

  chris bell was in trouble needed him
venus mines

chris who had fought at his side on jupiter
a score of years ago he hunched his shoul-
ders thrust his massive head before him
and bored into the wind that was a solid
wall hed get to chris despite all

ritt was lifted from his feet by the
wind thrown against the heavier form
of his companion arnim shouted something
the lad could see his ups moving but could
hear nothing above the tornados roar a
dripping arm gestured to the door of the little
building they had just quitted penger
wanted him to go back thought this storm
would lick him it was dry there dry and
safe

 it would be so easy to let the wind blow
him back in all this time they had struggled
only fifteen feet after all this was his post
the station he would be in charge of as soon
as the relief ship picked penger up no one
could blame him for staying behind-for
obeying orders

 but-he was a venus inc man one of
the stalwart company that was conquering
the far planets for earth and another
venus inc man had called for help off
there in the storm-lashed jungle he shook
his head thrust away the hand that was
pushing him back

  again penglers hand sought his shoulder
but only to squeeze it in token of approval
they slogged into the storm again

 at last they were through the curtain
arnim turned took something from the vol-
uminous pocket of his waterproof a tiny
radio-transmitter low-powered sending only
a long dash that varied completely in wave
length for a half minute the key to the
curtain-penger pressed the button a cor-
uscation of tiny flashes snapped through the
wind-tossed filaments the power was on-
that apparently frail barrier hummed now
with the grendon vibration

 britt could see the driven rain rebound
from the invisible wall nothing no human
body no venusian dart not even a high-
powered electro-bullet could pass through
the net the station was safe protected
against all intrusion until the machines that
produced the vibration were stilled by an-
other pressure on the little instrument with
its secret combination of frequencies

 into the jungle they went crawling now
through chance-found gaps in the matted
chaos of the cyclone-pounded vegetation
the black quagmire sucked at their feet
clinging lianas twisted around them clung
tenaciously thorns ripped at them a bolt
of lightning struck not a score of feet away
and sent a towering twisted fern into flaring
destruction

  the venusians fish-scaled and web-footed

incorporated	

though they were dared not prowl abroad
the very beasts-strange amphibious crea-
tures of a steamy primitive world-cowered
in their lairs or dug themselves deep be-
neath the sheltering mud of the jungle tarns

  but the earthlings pressed forward deaf-
ened gasping half-drowned wholly ex-
hausted a yard a foot an inch at a time
crawling scrambling twisting dragging
themselves through the terrific storm to an-
swer a comrades cry for help slogging into
the hurricane for hour after hour of intermi-
nable inhuman struggle

  two mud covered figures reeled out from
the edge of the jungle dazed bewildered
dizzy with exhaustion just ahead hung the
filaments of bells curtain intact they were
through through the jungle and the storm
the daring adventurers had reached their
goal how long it had taken them by what
devious route they had come they never
knew

  sometime during that endless journey the
electrical storm had ended but they had
never noticed it so stunned had they been
with the turmoil of the elements behind
them the drenched and cowering jungle was
straightening the drab cloud ceiling was
shot through with light the rain had dimin-
ished to a tenuous drizzle fine weather-on
venus

  ahead within the circling curtain was a
sea of mud a torpedo-shaped two-man
flier glistened in the filtering light half-
hidden behind a squat rough hut whose
door hung open what lay behind that door

chapter ii
through the curtain

mbenger his banta waterproof hanging

	in shreds moved forward wearily as
he came into the open a hiss ripped the still-
ness a red streak flashed past his hooded
and masked head the trader whirled threw
himself headlong to the ground

 down down quick he shouted to
the startled britt the youth dropped

 what the-

  shut up arnims whisper was urgent
lie still

  the lad twisted his head his companions
projector was in his outstretched hand his
keen eyes were darting from point to point
of the thicket fatigue seemed forgotten
where his waterproof had been tom away
by some thorn the cords of his neck
stretched tensely

  whats up he breathed

  see that out in the mud
	startling stories

  a tiny dart scarlet-feathered lay there-
a venusian poison dart a little shiver
thrilled the youth he had seen a huge three-
horned ratios ten feet high at the shoulder
brought down to instant death by one of
those sent with unerring skill from the
blow-pipe of a native hunter

  came near finishing me theyre-wah
the angry spat of pesgers weapon inter-
rupted an acrid smell of burned flesh
stung haldanes nostrils got him

 where who

  to the right see behind that s-shaped
liana

  the lad stared at first he could see noth-
ing then a tiny patch of-silver appeared just
beyond the arm-thick vine arnim had indi-
cated the youth started to rise but pengers
steely clutch stopped him

  down you fool there may be others
stay here till i call and dont moveif
you want to see earth again

  the motionless youngster watched penger
slide through the mud-so slowly that britt
looked twice to make sure he had moved at
all he disappeared beneath a dumb of
brown fungi umbrella-shaped his black
hood appeared above the toadstools his
shoulders glistening black with the damp-
ness haldane clenched his fists nervously
what an awful chance he was taking sup-
pose there were other unseen hunters watch-
ing for just this chance

  all right lad come along pengers
call seemed to come from the ground off
to one side then-who was standing there
was it bell the novice rose ran forward
crouching to where the other had suddenly
appeared without his banta cloak

  as haldane reached his companion the
mystery of the seeming newcomer was
solved penger was pulling his waterproof
from a withered fern-frond that was sup-
porting it he smiled grimly at the white-
faced youths ejaculation

  thought i was asking for a dart did
you just slipped this coat off stuck it up
and squirmed away if there had been more
of the natives around id have known it
darn quick-maybe got a chance to take
another clip at one lets see what this bird
i brought down looks like

  britt shuddered as he stared down at the
prostrate savage in spite of the low-
browed primitive face noseless and with
gills where the ears ought to be in spite
of the naked savages fish-scaled skin and
webbed feet the youth could not help but
feel him human

  only a few hours ago others of his kind
perhaps this very individual had been chaf-
fering with him at the trading post and
now he lay there unmoving a great gaping

hole in his chest black-charred at the edges
those electro-bullets did terrible execution
when their high-powered radite charge was
released on impact
come on britt hes dead to stay lets
get in to chris

  penger had his little combination set in
his hand had pressed the switch button
the hum of the generator from the hut in
the center of the compound ceased the
two dived through the dangling filaments
and arnim flashed on the protecting vibra-
tion again-just in time

  at the jungle edge another venusian had
appeared panting his dart whirred from
the hollow reed he raised to his mouth fell
back impotently from the curtain

  nothing wrong there gasped britt

 they had clumped wearily through the
viscid mud were at the huts entrance

 chris arnim called chris were
here then there was a choking gasp
darn them oh dam them it was a sob
and a prayer for vengeance

  there on the wet green-slimed floor lay
chris bell his tall thin form was contorted
in agony the sharp features were clammy
white the little black mustache blacker yet
by contrast the transmitter of his tele-
talker was clutched tight in his right hand
the sleeve ripped away showed a livid red
burn on the white arm

  his right foot was bare the trouser cut
away the leg was swollen to twice three
times its natural size up to where buried
in the blackened flesh a twisted leather
thong cut in-horribly on the floor a red-
feathered dart its tip bloodstained told its
mute story

  chris old man wake up were here
chris he isnt dead he cant be gone
pengers hand was within bells shirt a
faint flutter almost imperceptible beat
against the probing finger tips

 whiskey britt-there must be some
around find it quick

	haldane shot a quick glance around
 the little room on a shelf he saw a
familiarly shaped container the purple b
p c seal unbroken he twisted off the seal-
ing cap penger had the bottle-neck between
bells teeth a little rivulet dribbled out at
the corners of chris mouth then he swal-
lowed convulsively the eyelids flickered
a grimace of pain distorted his face a groan
then his eyes opened

 arnim his voice was a shadow the
words were being forced out by sheer will
power never mind me-done for papers
in flier-must be filed-at once letter too
-explains go

  chris old boy what happened to you
venus mines

how did they get you

  the dying man motioned to the bottle
penger administered another dose of the
stimulant a little color came into bells
cheeks

  why dont we do something for him mr
penger burst from britt

  nothing we can do was pengers hope-
less response once that dart-poison gets
into you its only a question of time before
you kick off only thing thats kept him
alive so far is the thong hes tied around his
leg but the poisons seeping back in spite
of it-cant you see how black his skin is
above the tied part soon it will reach his
heart

   chris was talking again his voice a little
stronger with the false strength lent it by
the whiskey he was answering arnims
last question

  came through the curtain

  through the curtain how in hades-

  yes through the curtain it was
charged im sure of that bells voice was
blurred with agony low but very clear an
inner strength seemed to be supporting him
to be warding off the hovering death

   it was charged but just as i was going
over to the wanderer to take off there was a
whine from the jungle a whine that rose
and fell and a shower of darts most struck
against the curtain and fell but some got
through and one clipped me hung in my
leg a glance of astonishment passed be-
tween penger and haldane but they did
not interrupt the wounded mans laboring
narrative

  i dragged myself in here strapped the
leg knew it was no use but i had to get
a message through to you i called and
called while that whine rose and fell rose
and fell out there somewhere and the sav-
ages showed themselves around the curtain
and blew their darts through it i watched
them through the open door while i called
you and waited dizzy for the answer that
never came

   just a little round spot i noticed in the
curtain where the darts came through i
kept shouting for you till i passed out then
i came to again and called again and that
infernal whine still came from the jungle
and the fish-faced natives were dancing and
still you didnt answer

  then everything went black again dont
know whether i dreamed or not but it
seemed i came to and the noise from the
jungle was louder and through a haze i
thought i saw a venusian creep up to the
curtain and start through coming through
the curtain though i could hear my gen-
erator going full force then when his body
was halfway through he seemed to shrivel

incorporated	

up and drop with an awful look of agony

on his face

  again i passed out thunder thunder and
lightning roused me thank god the whin-
ing sund had stopped a last dart hit the
very spot the others had come through but
fell back i called again-hopelessly i heard
your answer then-blackness again   

  the last word trailed off into nothingness
the white eyelids drooped but came open
again bell struggled into a sitting position

  dont dont let them beat us arnim
they-never licked us yet do you hear me
--old man-its getting-dark where-
where are you

  right here chris right here beside you
what is it you want me to do

  the wanderer-the papers are there-
and a letter-for you oh-oh-the pain
his -hand clutched at his heart his eyes
stared unseeingly before him arnim-
britt-get that claim filed go as you love
old earth-leave me and go

  he fell back

  good-bye he whispered then he quiv-
ered and lay still good-bye pal there
was the suspicion of a sob in pengers voice
then he turned to the white-faced shaken
haldane the veterans face was grim his
eyes like chilled steel

  if you ever make half the man he
was   he choked left the sentence un-
finished strode across to the still open door
and stood there staring out

  britt bent to the motionless body straight-
ened it threw over it a blanket from the
neatly made bunk a thick silence reigned
in the room broken only by the eternal
swish of the rain

  britt-come here pengers voice cut
startlingly through the quiet haldane leaped
to the doorway look a red metallic
sphere was rising from the jungle a scant
quarter-mile away and disappearing in the
haze thats rutnoms station ship or im
a dog-faced jovian

  rutnom thats the mitco super on
venus isnt it whats he doing over here
in venus inc territory

  thats what i want to know ive run up
against him before on jupiter a sneaking
dirty fighter im going out there

  but-the venusians

  dam the venusians i want to know if
he was at the bottom of this deviltry why
the curtain failed god help him if what i
suspect is true

  then im going with you

  you stay here

  mr penger i would never forgive myself
if you got into trouble out there and i wasnt
able to help please  

  oh well if you will be a fool listen-
	startling stories

when were through the curtain let me go
ahead follow about fifty feet behind keep
in what shelter you can and protect my rear

  for the love of mike dont fall asleep and
dont take your finger off the button on your
projector if they get me try to get back
understand haldane nodded

fcnce outside the protecting network
he crouched in the shelter of a gnarled
root and marvelled at the dexterity with
which the veteran moved through the
thicket darting from cover to cover like a
gliding shadow when his time to proceed
came britt strove to imitate his leader but
by comparison with the others silent passage
he seemed to be crashing recklessly through
the tangled underbrush

  suddenly arnim halted bent low was
staring at something through the bleached
foliage haldan obeyed the covert signal to
halt after long minutes penger gestured
for him to come up

  look at that penger pointed with his
projector through the leafy screen britt
strove to pierce the mist and the rain could
make out nothing in the haze then a vagrant
breeze cleared away the obscuring fog he
was looking at a clearing man-made he
could see the hacked stumps of the jungle
growth still raw

  in the center of the opening was a tangled
mass of wires coils broken glass the
ground was blackened and scarred as if a
lightning bolt had just struck to one side
a depression in the mud rapidly filling with
water showed where the martian sphere
had rested

  thats where the whining noise came
from i half-thought chris was delirious-
but i see it now thats why ihe curtain
failed-why we couldnt hear bell some
ray-projector like a searchlight-that neu-
tralized the grendon vibration where it im-
pinged and also drowned the communication
waves

  concentrated it was powerful enough to
open a passage for the darts but when they
diffused it to cover a space big enough for
a man to get through it neutralized only
partly thats what killed the savage

  how could the natives have invented
anything like this ventured britt

  natives fooey its rutnom up to his old
tricks using the savages to cover his own
tracks so that he could put on a bland smile
of innocence when the b p c police inves-
tigate he pulled that before on jupiter but
why why theres plenty of web here for
both of us

  mr bell said something about filing
papers on the wanderer-and a letter

  of course i see it now that was a jovium

burn on his arm and i thought he was
raving was dreaming himself back in the old
days wait the satona the mitco relief
ship is due here in a week we have no
time to lose come on

  the trader was off at a run reckless of
possible ambush britt followed wondering
back into the compound

  no time to bury him now well be back
penger shouted as he sealed shut the door
of bells tomb in moments the earthmen
were in the little two-man flier penger
sprang to the control levers a roaring blast
stirred the mud beneath then the wanderer
had leaped free was shooting through the
cloud banks at terrific speed

  britt was thrust to the floor by the tre-
mendous force of acceleration arnim clung
to the control levers gasping in the visor
screen there was nothing but grey drifting
wisps of vapor then came a sudden glorious
burst of light-the sun-the sun the ter-
restrials had not seen for half an earth year

chapter iii

the chase through space

tthe wanderer reached the limit of its

	normal speed settled down to its steady
pace of two hundred earth miles a second
released from the pressure of the accelera-
tion britt felt a sudden lightness already
they were far enough from venus to be los-
ing the effects of her gravity

  penger switched on the coils that normal-
ized this condition within the ship he
studied the banked gauge faces with their
serried rows of quivering needles leafed
rapidly through the chart book conveniently
clamped beside the control levers then he
made certain adjustments and locked the
levers

  all set shes on the automatic control
now nothing to do about navigation until
we get within a quarter-million miles of
ganymede now lets take a look at whats
happening behind

  he twirled the wheel of the periscope on
the visor screen against the blackness of
space with its myriad golden twinkling
points the great ball of venus stood out a
vast sphere of heaving vapors glowing glori-
ous in the light of the sun the two men
crowded close to the screen searching for
sign of a pursuer

  the martian isnt following wise boy
his small boat hasnt the speed of the wan-
derer wed walk away from him

  heres the letter sir that mr bell spoke
about
venus mines incorporated



  a fleeting smile crossed amims face

  oh you want to know what its all about
do you cant blame you hand it over

 penger read aloud

  arnim im writing this to drop down into
your enclosure from the wanderer before
i make off for ganymede ive got great
news for you but i dont dare talk to you
over the tele-talker for fear the martians
will overhear

 first i owe you an apology for the
first time i think in the nearly twenty years
weve fought together as venus inc men
ive kept a secret from you and thats be-
cause it wasnt my secret last time i was
on earth stromstein told me in strictest
confidence that the jovium mines on jupiter
both ours and mitcos were petering out
he didnt think theyd last another two
years

 no wonder arnim exclaimed britt
looked at him questioningly but penger
resumed his reading

 you know what that would mean of
course so you can imagine how i felt
when on that mapping trip i took i stum-
bled on a mountain of the peculiarly green-
ish rock that is characteristic of the jovium
deposits on jupiter

 i immediately staked the claim then
worked back through the jungle to where
about twenty miles away i had left the
wanderer i had to get a badinite flash you
see to take a sample in according to the
rales of the b p c mineral claims com-
mission the stuff was almost pure i got
a nasty bum on my arm when i brushed
against it too

  on my way back after i got my sample i
ran into astna rutnoms sidekick he looked
queerly at the flask and the burn on my
arm but i thought fast and told him i was
out collecting insects and the flask was the
only thing i could find to put them into i
think i fooled him but im a little worried

  yeah he fooled him penger interrupted
himself you cant put much over on those
martians

 nothing much more ive got the wan-
derer all set for a long trip and as soon as
i finish this i take off for ganymede to file
the claim after that we can thumb our
noses at rutnom

 youll be back on earth by the time i
return lucky fellow give my regards to
the bright lights and tell the kid ill get
in touch with him as soon as i get back
venus wont be such a lonely place when
they start working the mine so long chris

  just about what i figured penger con-
cluded when i saw what rutnom had been
up to lets take a look at the location
papers

  heres the dispatch box sir but its
sealed

  sealed well ill be darned penger
looked disconsolately at the square box of
argento-platinoid that britt held out to him
thats a tough note suppose we lose that
somehow-only bell knew where that de-
posit is and hes gone

even captains of interplanetary trading
ships are sometimes venal and mitco
was ever willing to pay well for a glimpse
of the reports and other dispatches that
shuttle across the skies between the earth
companys far flung stations and the great
central headquarters at denver

  hence these dispatch boxes were devised
once sealed they could not be opened save
by the intricate unsealing apparatus that
existed only at denver and by virtue of
the supreme power of the b p c at such
control points of the august body as the
mineral claims office on ganymede any at-
tempt to get at the contents by force re-
leased a chemical within that utterly de-
stroyed everything enclosed

  well well have to take good care we
dont lose it arnim continued i see the
badinite flask is here with the sample good
now what do you say we get some food
into us

  i think thats a splendid idea mr bell
certainly stocked the ship up well with food
tablets and the water tanks are all filled
say if it wasnt for thinking of him lying
back there this would be a lark i never
expected to be on my way to jupiter

  its no junket and dont kid yourself
ive never known rutnom or any other mitco
man to give up without a scrap theyll be
after us beyond a doubt and well have
our job cut out to beat them

  im not worried mr penger britt re-
torted confidently i know youll win out
say mr penger the lad broke out after
a silence during which both had busied
themselves with disposing of enormous doses
of concentrated food why should rutnom
go to such lengths to jump our claim after
all the governments have a monopoly of
jovium theres no question of anybody
making any money out of it

  plenty of reason if we dont get this
claim filed there wont be any earthmen
worrying about making money after a few
years you heard what bell wrote about
the mines on jupiter petering out

  yes sir

  well-you know what jovium is used foe
its the catalyst that made interplanetary
voyaging practical oh we had space ships
before the deposits were found on jupiter
but they had to carry such enormous vol-
startling stories



umes of fuel to get anywhere that there
was neither space nor carrying capacity left
for commercially practicable freight nor
what is more important in the present in-
stance heavy armanment

  all they were fit for was to carry two or
three men on exploration trips that was
the case on mars as well as on earth their
fuel differed somewhat but the principle was
the same

  mercury it is true had had solar energy
motors for ages but they refuse to divulge
the secret

  their civilization is so far ahead of ours
that they refuse to have anything to do with
terrestrials or martians whom they look
down upon as we look down upon the
savages of jupiter and venus true they
keep the peace but that is because they feel
it an obligation placed on them because of
their superiority

  the discovery of jovium initiated the
commercial exploitation of the far planets
it initiated also a race in spatial armament
between mars and earth that so far has
been a dead heat

  britt was listening attentively he had
naturally heard all this on the school-
broadcasts but listening to dry history and
hearing it told by a man who had seen the
history in the making had helped to make it
were different matters

  besides he thrilled at the thought he was
even now taking part in a new chapter of the
stirring story

  you have seen a little of the ruthless
nature of the martians what do you think
would happen to earth if our jovium mines
were exhausted and they still had a plentiful
supply such as bell credits to this new
deposit

  theyd drive earth out of space

  yes and probably attack us at home so
you see how vitally important it is for us
to get that box and what it contains safely
to ganymede

  why were you in such a rush to get off
once we were away from venus rutnom
couldnt give us any more trouble you
said yourself that his flier hasnt nearly
the speed of the wanderer

  his ship hasnt but the satona is due in
a week it will take us twenty days to make
the trip at our best rate she can do it in
ten with her armament we wouldnt stand
the chance of a snowball on the sun against
her should she catch up with us and shell
try my boy shell try

  we ought to make it with about forty-
eight hours to spare but those mitco boats
dont adhere to schedule very closely and she
might well reach venus a day ahead of time
if she does youll see some fun

vfcay after day the wanderer drove across
the immensity of space day after
day the terrestrials watched the visor
screens took turns scanning the wide velvety
blackness of the heavens through the electro-
telescope only the glory of the widespread
firmament met their weary glance a week
passed by and still there was no sign of a
pursuer the earthmen began to breathe
more freely a little more and they would
be beyond reach of the martians

  then on the eighth day britt at the tele-
scope suddenly exclaimed

  mr penger whats this a new star
or  

  penger sprang to the telescope glowing
redly in the oblique rays of the sun was a
new body a star whei-e no star should be
even as he gazed it grew took form of a
tiny half-disk

  its the satona all right and just as i
was beginning to think wed get away with it
look at her come here britt watch her
while i try to get some more speed out of
this scow

  haldane clung fascinated to the eye-piece
while penger thought desperately of how he
might avoid them with his given energy
his speed was sadly limited aid the pointer
of the speed indicator would not move above
the  mark on its dials it would be suicidal
to use up energy in getting any more out of
the wanderer

  gosh mr penger shes overhauling us
hand over fist she must be doing five hun-
dred a second

  shes mitcos fastest ive heard she made
six-fifty on her test trip well well dodge
her as long as we can

  the satona was clearly defined now on
the large visor screen a hemishpere glinting
in the oblique rays of the sun on and on
sped the little wanderer without rest across
the void its occupants thinking and think-
ing as if seeking to increase the speed of
their craft by the very intensity of their
wills and on and on came the pursuer
bulking ever larger on the screen

  isnt there anything we can do to keep
those papers from them britt grated out
once between clenched teeth

  if worse comes to worst ill smash the
box that will destroy them but it wont
do much good-only delay matters theyll
search venus till they find bells mine and
make sure no earthmen has a chance to run
across it

  but we can send out expeditions too
yeah earth will never know till its too
late you dont think theyll leave us alive
to tell the story no our only chance is to
get the box through to ganymede and im
darned if-hold on ive got a hunch it
venus mines

might work

  pengers eye had drifted mechanically to
the ground glass chart across which a red
dot was moving to indicate the wanderers
position in the reaches of interstellar space
blue disks showed the direction of earth
the sun venus jupiter the other planets
but an inch ahead a band of tiny blue dots
wandered across the map they represented
the asteroids-small fragments of a blasted
planet following their own orbit around the
central sun

  the veteran changed the field of the visor
screen the following satona venus the
sun swept out of sight directly ahead the
periscope pointed golden in the tremendous
distance jupiter beckoned but here-not
forty thousand miles ahead was a light
fleck something catching the sunlight pen-
ger granted

  get bearings on the satona britt how
far behind is she

  only a hundred and ten thousand miles
relative speed about four hundred per sec-
ond shell have us in five minutes
here the other snapped take the con-
trols hold her on the mark ive set

  britt sprang to obey a question trembled
on his bps but pengers peremptory tone
the grim set of his jaw forbade the wan-
derer had veered from her course was driv-
ing for the asteroid revealed now as a
blurred ball ten miles in diameter revolving
at incredible speed arnim had snatched up
the precious box was in the nose of the ship
his hand on the handle of the bow porthole
the flier would miss the asteroid by scant
miles they were passing it
turn her man turn her left quick
even as britt twisted the dial to obey arnim
had the port open was throwing the box
out in the direction of the wanderers curv-
ing flight was struggling to close the thick
glass against the outrush of air the flier
curved in a great semicircle around the
whirling midget planet headed back toward
the satona now right at hand penger was
at the telescope

chapter iv
caught

a voice sounded in the chamber a grat-
    ing metallic voice

  halt wanderer

  amims eye was glued to the telescope
eyepiece to haldanes wonder he paid not
the slightest attention to the challenge the
youth hesitated then with a flush of anger
reddening his face he sprang to the controls

incorporated	

  some wild scheme of escape must have
inspired him at he swung lever after lever
sending the little flier darting about in mad
erratic zig-zags and still no sound came
from penger save a muttered i think its
working

  again the voice sounded coldly con-
temptuous from the wanderers space-radio
receiver

  do not resist earthman it is useless
rutnom speaking

  britts face was livid with fury he shook
his fist at the image that filled the visor
screen the great bulking image of the mar-
tian spaceship a rusty red egg of metal with
the intertwining symbols that spelled m i
t co in the martian graphs

  suddenly the wanderer lurched her dart-
ing rushes checked in midspace a tre-
mendous force had seized her was drawing
her irresistibly toward her enemy the
earthship shook with the thunder of her
rocket-tubes the void about seethed with
flaring gases

  but the power that could send her careen-
ing through space at twice a hundred miles
a second was puny against the pull of the
martians magnetic fields inexorably the
little flier was drawn back back back
until at last she drifted against the metallic
side of the satona and clung there

  now at last penger was tom from the
telescope that so queerly absorbed him

  cut it out you fool he whispered ur-
gently to britt let me handle this then
aloud as the tube-exhausts dwindled and
died penger speaking what do you want
of us rutnom

  ah its penger i have to deal with
there was satisfaction in the metallic tone
you know what i want the location map
of the jovium mine bell found deliver that
together with the sample flask pledge me
your word not to report this occurrence and
you shall be permitted to return to venus
unharmed

  pengers response was cold and very calm

  sorry i havent the chart

  dont trifle with me you would not be
making this hurried voyage toward antka
had your comrade not delivered it to you
come now you must realize that you are
helpless and you of all earthmen should
know it is dangerous to play with me

  you know my reputation i do not lie i
had the chart it is true but when i saw that
i could not escape you i threw the dispatch
box that contained it from the bow port of
my ship it is beyond your reach

  the martian name for jupiter though rutnom was
speaking in english he failed to translate this in his
anger


startling stories

 beyond my reach why penger you
grow senile i noted and wondered at your
erratic maneuver i noted what you did in
our televisor you threw the box into the
gravitational field of the asteroid your box
lies on it by now the rock is very small
you planned to rid yourself of me and return
for it so youve rendered my task easy we
descend after i have recovered the map i
shall deal further with you

  hes outguessed me britt there was
exasperation despair in pengers tone but
the staring youngster noted and wondered at
the smile that played around his tight-lipped
mouth a warning gesture stayed the ques-
tion foreshadowed in the lads eager eyes

  the satona with the wanderer held tight
against her sphere had hung motionless in
space during this interchange now the cap-
tured terrestrials could see the blue flare
from the tube exhausts of the martian space-
sphere and feel the vibration of their blast

  slowly at first then faster and faster the
coupled ships began to circle the whirling
asteroid rapidly the speed of the artificial
satellite increased till to an observer far
off in space the course of the coupled fliers
must have been a gray blurred circle whose
centre was the planetoid itself a blur be-
cause of the tremendous rate at which it
turned

  to arnim and britt watching their viso-
screen the effect of the circling was other-
wise across the black sky was drawn a
dazzling white arc that was the sun the
stars were darting golden lines but the
little planet became distinct as their speed
neared that of its rotation

  now they could see it as a jagged mass of
bare rock it was not ball-shaped for this
was not a world that had been formed while
molten but a bit torn from some ancient
planet in an unimaginable cataclysm it was
a great jagged boulder roughly oblate ten
earthmiles through at its widest diameter
perhaps six miles at its narrowest

wj utnom spiralled lower as the speed in-
creased the asteroid covered the
screen a bare rocky shelf split and rent by
its birth throes

  hello were drifting backward britt
broke the silence

  penger laughed shortly

  looks like it but its simply that we
havent quite reached the speed at which the
asteroid is turning

  at last the landing was made

  whoever is handling that boat is a pilot
was arnims tribute to the jarless halt then
his face grew suddenly grim some rocket
tubes are still on quick lad how are they
inclined

  straight up sir

  penger nodded

  then he hasnt thought of it he mut-
tered in tones scarcely audible to britt
keep quiet and follow my lead well lick
these birds yet with a bit of luck he slid
open the beryllium-steel shield that covered
the glass sideports

  an airlock door in the side of the satona
had opened grotesque in their goggled
billowing spacesuits three martians were
coming down a swinging ladder the weight
of the wanderer still clamped against her
shell was holding the larger craft askew
not great this weight it is true for the
gravity of the miniature world was exceed-
ingly minute but the martian captain had
evidently thought it not worth while to cor-
rect the canting by use of his power-
exhausts

  arnim and britt watched the ten-foot-tall
aliens stride across the short stretch of deck
to the entrance back of their own vessel
around the waist of each a studded belt was
clamped its excrescences showing where the
individual gravity coils were inserted were
it not for these the martians would have
been rising a hundred feet with each step so
small was the asteroids attraction

  as their captors reached the wanderer
rutnoms voice sounded again

  open your airlock for my men earthlings
and admit them

  and suppose i refuse

 then we shall burn our way through
and it will be the worse for you i warn you
again penger i am in no mood to be trifled
with

  the veteran shrugged his shoulders and
swung over the switch that actuated the
outer door of the lock to britts astonish-
ment his left eye closed in an unmistakable
wink as he did so the veteran had some
plan some strategy haldane racked his
brain in an effort to guess it but could
evolve nothing

  the giant invaders were within the ship
the terrestrials hands shot upward as they
noted the squat infra-red heat guns clutched
ready in their hands from one of the mar-
tians apparently the leader came a guttural
sentence in his own language the others
advanced warily in a trice penger and
haldane had been seized searched none too
gently their weapons extracted and their
wrists bound with tough cords

  here not so rough britt had protested
as his arms were twisted down behind his
back but his exclamation brought no re-
sponse save a particularly vicious tightening
of his bonds arnim was silent though his
eyes were glowing like live coals

  the two prisoners were thrust uncere-
venus mines incorporated



moniously against the wall of their vessel
the apparent leader remained at guard over
them the wicked snout of his weapon never
moving from its threatening posture while
the two others commenced a hurried but
thorough search of the cabin

  every nook or cranny was invaded the
door of the food closet was ripped from its
hinges the plates of the flooring toin up as
a heat gun melted its rivets even the metal
walls of the vessel were scrutinized inch by
inch for evidences of a concealed hiding
place

  suddenly there was a grunt from one of the
martians signalizing his finding of the badi-
nite sample flask

  at last apparently satisfied that the loca-
tion map was not on board the chief of the
mitco men spoke aloud in the curious con-
catenation of consonantal sounds that was
the martian language from the speaker
came a crisp rejoinder then in his precise
english rutnoms admonition to the earth-
lings

  you will be brought to this ship you two
set your gravity pads at full earth setting
the attraction of this world is negligible

cilently the venus inc men per-
 mitted themselves to be invested in their
space suits after having made the indicator
adjustment on the padded attraction plates
once again britt started to protest at the
unnecessary harshness with which he was
being handled

  however he again caught a warning look
on pengers face

- as the little group crossed to the satona
the empty sleeves of the terrestrials space
suits stuck out queerly straight before them
as if a high wind were blowing britt noted
this and wondered there could be no wind
for the asteroid was utterly devoid of atmos-
phere

  then he forgot the matter and gave him-
self up utterly to the black mood of despair
that flooded him

  divested once more of their encumbering
garments within the shelter of the martian
spacespheres hull penger and haldane stood
at bay facing the gigantic figure of mitcos
venusian representative and the bulking
forms of a dozen others ranged behind him
the martians were counterparts of the
earthmen save for their size and the curious
greenish tint of their skins

  even as he bravely met rutnoms sneering
stare britt was conscious of a strange light-
ness a feeling of power that comported oddly
with his situation then he realized that the
gravity coils of the satona were adjusted to
mars conditions that the weight the in-
ternal pressure of every part of his body

was one-third what it would be on earth or
venus

  rutnom was speaking a threat in every
syllable he uttered

  penger i am growing tired of this tell
me where that deposit lies

  arnim returned the martians stare

  if i knew i wouldnt tell you but luckily
i know as much about it as you

  the green tinge of rutnoms face deep-
ened

  his tiny red eyes shot fire

  you lie penger

  the veteran made no reply

  i said you lie rutnom raised his gun
ominously ill burn ever bit of skin from
your body inch by inch till you tell me
what i want to know

  pengers gaze was level

  bell had no time to tell me before he
died and he had already sealed the chart
in the dispatch box

  the eyes of the two ancient enemies met
and clung veins stood out on rutnoms
forehead as he strove to read the earthmans
thought but his gaze was the first to waver
and fall

  very well since you are so stubborn
and i am in haste i shall search for the box
it should not be hard to find on this bare
terrain but mark you if i fail ill wring
that location from you if i have to smash you
into a quivering pulp

	n staccato sentences the martian is-
m sued swift orders to his men

  fresh thongs were strapped about the
earthlings ankles and those about their
wrists tightened

  all but one of the martians slid into space
suits

  then the great hull emptied and britt and
arnim were left alone with one huge guard
watching their prone bodies one guard
but his eyes never wavered from them as
they lay sprawled on the floor where they
had been thrown and the terrible heat-gun
of mars was ready in his hand

  britt twisted till he could look out through
a porthole outside on the tumbled rocky
plain he could see the martians clustered
about their leader then they scattered and
rutnoms plan was quickly evident back
and forth back and forth the hunters quar-
tered each with his own small portion of
the asteroids surface to search

  not a square inch of the territory would
be left uncovered by this scheme he
groaned aloud there was no hope that the
precious box would escape scrutiny what
could penger have been thinking of better
to have pulled at the lid and thus destroyed
the map
	startling stories

chapter v
strategy

perhaps he hoped that a patrol ship
would rescue them in time but the
whirling asteroid and all its surface was a
blur to a space wanderer they were as
effectually concealed as though they were a
hundred feet below the surface he became
aware that the trader was talking

  but what was he saying despair clutched
the lads heart coldly dispassionately he
was reviling the personal appearance the
ancestry the habits of the guard

  britt did you ever see anything like him
hes got the face of one of thoce little pigs
that have just had a ring pushed through
theirs snouts and his body-if  were shaped
like that i would have drowned myself long
ago look at those eyes why you can see
the fear staring out of them hes a coward
boy thats why rutnom left him behind
hes afraid of us tied up as we are

  now haldane understood pengers peculiar
behavior the strange air of amusement that
had hovered about him through all this catas-
trophe his inexplicable action his mind
had given away the long years of loneli-
ness the death of his best friend the capture
by rutnom had smashed a brain that long
had been famed as the keenest of all venus
incs force

  that ugly-looking martian must be the
misbegotten offspring of the foulest scum of
his putrid planet the quiet voice went on
with its taunting the martian was standing
it well his watchful expression unchanged
but sooner or later penger would get under
his skin-and then-britt hoped that the
heat gun killed quickly

  no britt im not crazy the youth was
startled by his remark just wanted to find
out if the brute understood english he
doesnt ive been using some of the worse
insults you can apply to a martian even if
he had self-control enough not to do any-
thing his expression would have shown that
he understood

  if i had started whispering to you he
would have been suspicious but he thinks
im simply cussing out our capture now
listen

  in the same calm dispassionate tones pen-
ger continued and as he talked britts
despair was forgotten and hope came to him
again

  youre near enough to the wall to get
your feet against it arnim concluded so
i guess the most dangerous part of the job
will be yours you know what to do ill

follow your lead but dont take too long to
get set rutnom may tumble at any moment
and then well be through

  he fell silent and both men closed their
eyes and seemed to sleep after a bit britt
moved restlessly swung himself so that the
soles of his feet were flat against the wall
and he was lying curled on his side

  slowly he opened his eyes the merest slit
the martian guard was still seated ten feet
away still watchful then with an explosion
of energy britt drove his feet hard against
the wall his lithe body rose catapulted
across the ten-foot space driven by muscles
attuned to earths gravity

  before the startled martian realized what
was happening britts head struck his soft
stomach with terrific force over he went
with a grunt as his weapon flew out of his
hand and he instinctively threw hfcs arms
wide clutching for support

  meantime arnim was whirling over and
over across the floor as he heard the crash
of the martians collapse behind he brought
up with a thump against the legs of the con-
trol desk above he saw the lever that con-
trolled the ship straining upward his teeth
closed over the handle

  the corded muscles of his neck stood out
as he wrenched backward with all the
strength that was in him for a moment the
lever remained motionless then as he drove
his knees into the floor and jerked backward
once again the lever gave searing flames
flared across his face burned and blinded
him at the sudden cutting off of the current
britt tumbling in unequal combat with the
martian giant heard the roar of the rocket
tubes stop then he felt the floor drop away
beneath him felt himself lifted smashed
against something blackness enveloped him
but even as he lost consciousness he heard
a great shout of triumph from his leader

k dash of icy water in his face brought
 haldane to his head throbbed with
pain needle pricks stung his arms and legs
he raised a hand to his aching brow why
he was free arnim was bending over him
all right lad are you all right he was
asking anxiously

  yes i guess so a little dizzy but thats
all he forced himself to a sitting position
but youre burned across pengers face
were three livid burns one eye was closed
by a white blister half his scalp was a
blackened patch of singed hair

  a little penger grinned they had
plenty of juice going through that control
might have been worse i got off lucky so
did you take a look at your late antagonist
crumpled against the wall was the body of
the guard the queer angle at which his
venus mines incorporated

head lolled told the story of a broken neck

  he was on top luckily when the smash
came you both flew through the air but he
hit the wall first and made a cushion for
you i held onto the lever with my teeth so
i didnt get any of it id like to see rutnoms
face now down there stuck on that asteroid
with no way to get off he gestured to the
visoscreen

  the blackness of interstellar space was mir-
rored there the far-off glowing worlds the
nearer sun and tiny in the distance a
whirling blurred ball that britt recognized

  gosh mr penger youve tricked him
nicely i never thought of the fact that the
gravity of that little planet would not be
sufficient to counteract the centrifugal force
set up by its rapid ation

  no and what is more important neither
did rutnom i was sure of that when you
told me that he only had his top-rockets on
when he landed though i was almost certain
when he talked about the box being down
there all he thought of was the lack of
attraction thats why he kept his tubes
pressing the satona down since otherwise
he figured an unguarded shove would send
her careening off he forgot that the asteroid
itself was pushing away at her with a far
stronger power

  the box a sudden thought struck britt
weve lost that well have to go back to
venus and hunt for mr bells mine again
penger grinned

  nope well get that back too

  what do you mean it must be hundreds
of thousands of miles away by now shooting
through space we can never find it
wrong again my lad i know just where
she is and that was the most ticklish part
of the whole scheme why do you think i
kept my eye glued to that telescope while
you were swearing at rutnom

  the youngster looked at him blankly the
other went on happily

  i didnt swing around the asteroid the
way i did in order to hide what i was doing
from the martians in fact i hoped that he
would see what i did was to throw the dis-
patch box out at just the moment and speed
that would bring it sufficiently within the
attraction of the little planet to make it a
satellite to keep it swinging around through
space in an orbit of its own naturally i
didnt have time to calculate the exact con-
ditions but i took the chance and it worked
great then all we have to do is to swing
back there spot it in the telescope and scoop
it up

  well the other drawled in reply its
not going to be as easy as all that you see
i pretty much burned out the works here on
the satona about the only thing thats still



in order is the artificial gravity device i
managed to get that hooked up again but
the rest is gone

  then well have to get across to the wan-
derer and use that

  right get into your space suit and well
make a go for it

  they worked rapidly arnim felt for their
flashes they were intact in the outer
pockets

  switch off your gravity control he ad-
vised britt well be able to maneuver bet-
ter

 they were ready now penger led the
way threw open the outer lock they stepped
curiously light into outer space the vacuum
suits ballooned immediately

kor awhile they floated while arnim got

	his bearings directly ahead not over
fifty yards away lay the glittering ball of
the wanderer below spun a jagged frag-
ment of rock the tiny asteroid they had just
quitted

 arnim chuckled grimly he thought of
rutnom and the martians marooned on that
tiny desolation helplessly watching the space
ships drifting not more than five miles over-
head

  then he pulled out a little propulsion gun
and pointing it away from the wanderer
pulled the trigger he transformed himself
into a very inefficient rocket-like projectile
britt saw and wondered and did likewise

  but finally penger flashed his beam over
the smooth shining skin of the wanderer
they were home

  his gloved hand found the airlock switch

  they were standing within the old familiar
ship denuded of their space suits britt was
grinning happily arnim was at the electro-
telescope his eyes glued to the instrument
giving swift orders that britt translated into
instant action the little flier swerved and
accelerated shot off on sudden swift angles
at last penger motioned

  hold her there were right alongside

  he squirmed into his suit again dived into
the air lock britt waited intently it was
only five minutes before he returned but to
the anxious youngster it seemed hours the
precious argento-platenoid box with its even
more precious contents was under his arm

 ganymede was growing momentarily on
their screen arnim was sprawling luxuri-
ously in his hammock head resting on
thrown-back arms he wore the sleepy con-
tentment of a cat who had licked up all the
cream

britt however was pacing restlessly to
and fro a worried frown on his clear boyish

oe carnahan sat before the macbinc wailing

friends

by murray leinster

when joe carnahan and igor vladek the bixby twins

pool minds via telepathy it s

they came to joe carnahan in his
laboratory up in the blue ridge
mountains-two generals in a staff
car with other staff cars before and behind
one of the generals hrrrrrmphed and ahem-
med and observed that the president wished
to confer with joe and-hrrrrmph-could it
be arranged that news of his departure from
his laboratory wouldnt be known for a few

challenge to trouble-makers

days and joe carnahan suddenly looked
very tired

its happened eh he said

but the generals wouldnt answer that
they were very polite to him but their con-
versation was mestly hrrrrmphs and they
looked at him rather fiercely

joe carnahan was the most important
single unit in the armed forces of the united
friends



states and he knew it and they knew it too
and it embarrassed them because they wore
smart uniforms and had staff cars and aides
and he was simply a rather pleasant-faced
civilian he was a very lonely man too

 they rode toward washington in the staff
cars paying no attention whatever to the
speed limit if joe carnahan drove too fast
a state policeman would give him a ticket
but the generals could drive as fast as they
pleased and they did

 whats happened joe said again after
the cars started off who is it europia
europia was that country of middle europe
whose citizens called themselves europians
as citizens of the united states took to
themselves the title of americans and with
an equal lack of approval from other nations
on the same continent

 one of the generals said hrrrrmph that
there was a certain amount of tension and
just as a matter of precaution it was desir-
able for joe carnahan to be on hand in
washington but that nothing had happened
yet of course hrrrrmph

  meaning that its bound to happen said
joe carnahan so its been decided for us
to strike first you havent been able to train
anybody else to use the ky-

 the generals shushed him in a panicky
haste even in their own staff cars they
didnt want joe carnahans most important
military achievement to be named

 it was top priority top drawer number
one extra confidential secret it was a device
that was simply the one unbeatable weapon
in the world long-range rockets could be
handled now with other rockets equipped
with radar proximity fuses and other de-
vices which ranged them alongside the enemy
and kamikazed him bombers too were
sitting ducks for guided missiles moving at
supersonic speeds

  radar-planes cruising in the stratosphere
made sneak attacks of any sort quite impos-
sible and even the planting of atomic bombs
by spies was pretty well impossible since joe
carnahan had worked out a beautifully
simple trick for detecting fissionable mater-
ial

but the ky-the top priority top drawer
number one super-secret military
gadget was something else there couldnt be
any defense against the bombs it controlled
the only trouble was that you had to under-
stand it to make it work properly the mili-

tary men objected to a civilian handling it
and they tried hard to find a bright brisk
young officer with the necessary technical
background and personal qualifications to
handle it but so far theyd failed so joe
carnahan had to be called in and hastily
given assimilated rank when international
crises arose

  its europia he asked again whens
zero hour

  the two generals grew even more panicky
they had a good idea but you cant tell a
civilian the plans of the general staff they
hrrrmphed and ahemmed and said that it
was probably best to discuss the purpose of
his call to washington with the president
so joe carnahan leaned back in the staff-car
and closed his eyes

  i wish youd found somebody else to
handle the thing he said tonelessly after
a pause i was twinned with a europian
boy once i rather liked him his name was
igor vladek ever hear of him

  the general had and they felt consterna-
tion everybody on earth had heard of igor
vladek and of joe carnahan too they were
the two outstanding figures in the world of
science and their discoveries uncannily
seemed to have immediate and pressing im-
portance to the world of men but joe had
just told the generals that he and igor vladek
had been closer to each other than any
brothers ever were when he told them theyd
once been twinned

  the staff cars rolled swiftly along the fine
broad concrete highway toward washington
joe carnahan felt rather sick igor vladek
would quite certainly be killed in the war
that joe was to fight and he and igor had
been quite literally one mind and one
thought long ago

  theyd been among the first pairs of youths
to be twinned in bixbys idealistic attempt
to end international disagreements and dis-
trust bixby you remember found a basic
consciousness-frequency to which any hu-
man brain could be tuned and he made the
twinners

  people dont talk much about twinners
any more they feel that it isnt a pleasant
subject twinners though were little elec-
tronic devices in pairs if you wore one of
them and somebody else wore the other the
two of you became telepathic in regard to
each other not only telepathic though you
shared each others consciousness completely
you knew everything the other person
	startling stories

thought and he knew everything you
thought and his memory was as open to you
as your own

  it was bixbys idea that if children or
youths of different nations were twinned
with these devices then every pair of twins
would become a powerful force for inter-
national peace and understanding

  joe carnahan had been twinned with
igor vladek when they were both just four-
teen years old the time-difference between
their home was just enough so that when one
of the boys was most active the other might
be inclined to loaf they explored each
others brains with an absorbed interest and
each others surroundings with fascinated
attention within a week each knew all that
the other had ever known and was as com-
pletely at home in the others environment
as in his own

  they liked each other they knew each
other more thoroughly and more completely
than any two persons had ever been able to
know each other before twinning was de-
vised and joe carnahan would never be
able to hate europians because a part of his
boyhood memories were those of igor vladek
and igor would never be able to hate ameri-
cans because so many of his memories were
those of joe carnahan

  bixbys idea seemed like a good one at
first almost half a world apart two fourteen-
year-olds-whod never seen each other in
the flesh-lived in an intimacy that was
unparalleled joe carnahan knew what
chamois-hunting was like because igors
father took igor on a hunt igor vladek
knew exactly how to play center field

  presently-when they were fifteen-joe
carnahan shared the shy romance of igor
with a dark-eyed girl and igor knew exactly
the sensations of taking a freckled high-
school girl to a high-school dance it was
pretty wholesome for the two of them to be
twinned around that time they didnt
idealize each other but they did like each
other and neither wanted the other befouled
so it was probably the most satisfactory
friendship that two people ever had joe
carnahan had been a very lonesome person
after it ended

ridjng into washington in a staff car
with two uneasy generals beside him
and other cars around to make the whole
cavalcade conspicuous joe carnahan remem-
bered igor vladek with a wistful affection

  theyd always been friends other twinned
pairs revolted as they grew up twin-
ning wasnt good for most people secret
little weaknesses couldnt be kept secret so
twinned people were defiantly open about
them meanesses couldnt be hidden or de-
nied so they were indulged

  any little spot of rottenness in anybody
who was twinned was necessarily known to
the person who was twinned with him and
a great deal of rottenness is suppressed be-
cause it can be concealed twinning brought
to light too many undesirable traits

  twinned people turned up too frequently
in the criminal courts guilty of crimes they
wouldnt have committed if their thoughts
hadnt been shared by someone else

  so twinning was forbidden by law and
bixby died apparently of a broken heart
and his device was never used any more
it wasnt even used by psychiatrists because
a patient couldnt be examined without being
able to examine the psychiatrists mind too
and there are certain privacies-such as
family life-that nobody will willingly ex-
pose

  but that came later joe carnahan and
igor vladek were friends as long as they
were twinned they matched not that their
minds were identical they were comple-
mentary and each acquired the others
knowledge and capacity

  at seventeen igor made a jet-motor that
ultimately displaced the last of the old-style
intemal-combustion engines in europia joe
carnahan had helped of course at eighteen
joe produced a tricky freakish wing-surface
that lifted eight times as much per square
foot as any plane-wing had ever lifted before
and igor helped with that they were air-
minded then

  and when they went to college-but igors
was a university and they were ten thousand
miles apart-each had all the knowledge the
other acquired and igor became unpopular
with his professors because joe was avidly
reading american scientific magazines and
igor knew their contents long befox-e they
reached europia of course igor had a hand
-or a mind-in it when in his junior year
joe turned up the heat-converter that made
dynamos old-fashioned and then joe helped
when igor had problems to solve

  a long way away over the pine-clad hills
the wireless masts of arlington rose futilely
they were no longer used but the navy
never gives up a shore-post the thin white
friends	

spire of the washington monument appeared
one of the generals in the staff car with joe
suddenly hrrrmphed loudly and when joe
looked at him he said something obscure but
important sounding and uneasy about secur-
ity if joe had once been twinned with a
europian matters didnt look so good

  twinning was ordered stopped all of fif-
teen years ago said joe patiently the
army knew that id been twinned when they
asked me to work on counter-bomb devices
and that was even earlier but of course i
dont mind if you raise the question of secur-
ity

  to query his fitness for the handling of the
nations very top-drawer number one super-
secret weapon was ironic hed invented it
it was put to him as a matter of obligation
when the teeth were drawn from the united
nations peace-enforcement arrangements
igor had been asked to work for his govern-
ment too at about the same time and theyd
hated to stop being twinned but they had
to

  they turned in their bixby devices three
years before twinning was outlawed but
they were still friends joe and igor were
practically one self but on matters that had
to be military secrets they couldnt continue
to have one mind their obligations were
different igor owed loyalty to europia and
joe to the united states so theyd reluc-
tantly separated their thoughts

  the staff car swerved in toward washing-
ton past the fort meyer reservation and
presently the arlington bridge lay before
them and the staff cars closed in and swept
across the potomac and past the lincoln
memorial joe carnahan felt sick at what
lay ahead of him

  he and igor had written once or twice
after they turned in their twinners but
theyd had to stop that too their minds
were too closely attuned joe knew intuitive-
ly what igor had in the back of his mind no
matter how cryptically he phrased it and
igor could read more than was wise in the
baldest of sentences that joe might write
they were employed in the task of making
their respective nations safe against attack
they simply couldnt risk communication of
any sort

even when they ceased to write-well-
their minds had reached out and
touched a few times that was telepathy per-
haps or thought-transference it wasnt as

complete as the old twinning joe had been
thinking of igor one night and suddenly
he felt igors friendly thought and-sitting
quite alone ten thousand miles apart-for a
little while they talked eagerly if cagily

  they could veil their thoughts from each
other when not wearing twinners but they
knew each other too well to hide much very
successfully perhaps three or four times
they happened to think of each other simul-
taneously and their minds linked rather
tenuously but inevitably it was risky so
joe carnahan had been careful not to think
about igor these last few years

  hed been pretty lonely

   the staff cars didnt go to the white house
they went to another place entirely which
normally it was much more difficult to get
into then joe was escorted down under-
ground and traveled for a surprising distance
in a little car that ran by compressed air so
that its movement could not be detected
above-ground and ultimately he reached
a place so far below the surface that it was
believed even atomic bombs couldnt blast
it in

  then the generals hrrrrrmphing turned
joe carnahan over to a secretary who es-
corted him to the man who had sent for him
that man was twitching with strain and he
tried to explain to joe that everything pos-
sible had been done to smooth away the dif-
ferences between the united states and
europia but that the europian government
gave every sign of forcing the matter to war
and public opinion in the united states
would not permit the american government
to back down

  i know said joe he said it without
heat your party committed you at the last
election you won the election on an issue
of foreign policy you asked for this situa-
tion and youre stuck with it and if you
back down without a war-why-your party
might lose the next election

  the twitching man blinked at him a sec-
retary viewed joe with startled disfavor
there are some public officials so exalted
that it is a discourtesy to tell them the truth

   all right said joe tiredly if you dont
make a fight of it somebody else will the
same things probably true in europia elec-
tions have to be won even if they cause
wars the question is simply who will
make war first its my job to murder eu-
ropians for your political party to keep them
from murdering americans for one of their


startling stories

political parties when do i start

  the twitching man said that it was the
governments intention to wait until the last
possible instant in hope of some change in the
europian governments stand joe was to
take his post if he received the signal-
which would be a word flashed on a tele-
vision screen by the control-board-he was
to take offensive action against europia the
targets would have been listed for him with
their coordinates by the general staff

  what am i by the way asked joe with-
out interest last time i was called on i
was told i was a lieutenant colonel nothing
happened then

  the twitching man blinked helplessly the
secretary explained that joe was still a
lieutenant colonel no higher rank could be
granted to a civilian without official reserve
status war department regulations were
strict

  joe smiled without mirth

  all right he repeated it was just to
make the murder regular i wanted to be
sure i wasnt a civilian committing an atroc-
ity

  he ignored them thereafter and examined
his device it was very large and the parts
that did the simplest things were the most
complicated in construction

  he did not notice when the twitching man
went out he only noticed that the generals
had come in when one of them hrrrrmphed
at the other one

  well he said with a trace of impatience

  one of them ahemmed and said it would be
an historic moment and they wished to
watch

  get out said joe carnahan savagely
you bother me im busy

  one of the two generals hrrrmphed with
such indignation that it sounded like a bugle
and said stiffly that he knew that joe was
merely an assimilated civilian but neverthe-
less was subject to military discipline-

 get out raged joe carnahan you
cant even do your own murders ive got
to kill the best friend a man ever had

joe glared at them not making ready
while they remained after moments
of indignant hrrrmphing they went out

  he picked up the sheets of coordinates
he set them up savagely he ran through
the circuit-testing routine twice once with
one break to assure that the united states
top super-secret weapon did not go into

action and once with an entirely different
break so that every part of every circuit
was verified

 then he was ready to commit the most
monstrous murder ever engineered by men
because if he did not commit it upon the
people of another nation it might be com-
mitted upon the people of the united states

  he sat down grimly in the operators chair
he had sat there four times before three
times for tests of the ky the device the
fourth time when russian politics required
an international crisis for the benefit of those
in power that had been a near thing a
single long-range missle flung at the united
states would have forced him to push down
the plastic-handled operation lever and
make such a holocaust as six years of the
last war had hardly produced

 the room was very still it was deep
down in the bedrock under the alluvial soil
of the city it should be invulnerable joe
carnahan sat back and bitterly meditated
upon patriotism as a virtue used by dynasts
and demagogues to bloody all the pages of
history men were trapped by it because
other men were trapped by it for him to
close this circuit and that and then push
down the operations lever would create the
moment of greatest horror men had ever
known he would gain nothing by it but he
could not revolt against the order because
another man in another nation might not
revolt

  there was no decoration in this place it
had no thick carpet nor stately furniture
because no eminent person held sway here
only joe carnahan who had made his coun-
try close to invulnerable in defense and ir-
resistible in attack and his reward was the
order to kill

  he sat motionless his bps twisted waiting
he couldnt have made this machine if it
hadnt been that he once was twinned to
igor hed shared igors brain and by that
fact each of them had gained so that they
were scientists whose work-except for such
things as this-was good theyd had a
companionship that had made both of them
what they were and maybe igor was at this
moment sitting at the control-board of some
such monstrous device awaiting the com-
mand of another twitching politician

  joe felt a thought from igors brain it
was oddly friendly it formed words and
they formed the voice hed heard so often
with igors ears
friends	

  sure said igor wryly ten thousand miles
away sure im waiting for orders to blow
america to ruins i dont like it either

  joe carnahan froze into his mind came
bitterly the thought that he ought to send
word somehow that europia was ready to
strike too so it could be anticipated then
the thought that igor knew those thoughts

  uh-huh said igors voice in his brain
sure i know i know you didnt too fun-
ny huh

  not a bit said joe bitterly he yearned
toward igor and knew that igor knew it i
wish we could do something igor

  he felt no self-consciousness igor knew
what he was thinking they were two people
who knew each other so certainly that they
didnt even have to pretend

  whatve you got joe asked igor sud-
denly maybe if youve got something we
cant stand against i can make my side back
down

  joe carnahan tried very carefully to tell
igor-who was a part of himself after all-
what the top priority top drawer number
one super-secret military gadget could do
not what it was but what it could do he
held his brain grimly away from the details
of its construction he concentrated on re-
membering the tests and what theyd done to
a mountain range in antarctica

  yeah said the phantom of igors voice
in his brain then came pictures clear
lucid pictures not of the machine before
joe but of another different here and there
igors machine theyd been one brain for a
long time though in two bodies and now
their separated brains worked alike

  mines like this must be the same idea

but he already knew when joe carna-
han saw the pictures of igors machine
merely in recognizing the difference between
the two hed told igor every detail of his
own

  were even stephen said igor there
was the same grimness in his thought that
had come to joe weve got the same trick
joe the one who shoots last gets killed
whatre we going to do

  their brains merged more fully and for
a time joe was not conscious of question
and answer of separate thoughts the link-
age between them made possible by their
long attuning to each other became intensi-
fied by the identity of their emotions they
were one brain again thinking together like

a man thinking to himself but there were
two minds throwing thoughts into focus for
joint examination

  when the signal to fire came upon one of
the two television-screens both knew it at
the same instant if one fired both would
and the holocaust would be equal in both
nations

  no use in that joe said igors thought
look well shift coordinates and fire
testing my outfit i worked in antarctica
too remember your coordinates for testing
we blast hell out of the south pole

  they were one mind in two bodies as
theyd been long years before their hands
worked swiftly together making competely
different motions with no confusion at all
only long practise could have given them
that it felt extraordinary good to be one
brain with igor again and joe carnahan felt
a surge of emotion from his friend at the
controls of the machine which had been in-
tended to devastate the united states

  feels good huh

  igor felt as joe did and joe his face
pale and tense and his fingers flying at the
setting up of new coordinates felt as if he
were grinning at his brain-twin

  the second television-screen flashed the
signal joe carnahan was ordered to attack
europia the two sets of fingers almost
half a world apart finished their tasks and
then the two of them reached out their
hands and somehow grinning at each other
pushed down the operations handles on
their separate machines

  sheer annihilation rose into the air whin-
ing thinly the sound of its going ceased as
its component parts vanished for long long
seconds it would streak through space and
where it landed there would be nothingness
it would strike with such speed that no
detector-device could register its coming in
time to actuate a counter-weapon and when
it had struck there would be-simply nothing
at all

  there was a little clanging noise some-
where in the machine before joe carnahan
it was finished he relaxed he felt good
he felt clean he felt igor grinning with
him beyond an ocean and half a continent
more and swiftly swiftly the two minds
flung thoughts together for examination and
joe carnahan realized that for the first time
in long long years he was not lonely

 he knew-they knew-that the operation
of the two devices had been known to others


startling stories

than themselves in seconds now broadcasts
would begin justifying indignant broad-
casts the people of the united states would
be told of the imminent danger in which it
had been and that only instant and over-
whelming attack by the ever-ready defense
forces of the country had forestalled a mur-
derous and unwarned attack by europia

  the people of europia would also be told
of the monstrous and shameful intention of
the united states to rain down annihilation
and both nations would be told that the
danger was past since the other nation lay
in ruins

 theyre going to be wrathy and also
scared when they find out weve double-
crossed them said igor grinning theyll
probably shoot us certainly me and then
theyll try it again cant we do something
about that joe i think we can

  one brain again gleefully zestfully work-
ing it out



  the fact is simply that igor vladek and i
decided to call off the war said joe carna-
han evenly to the staring figures who faced
him we were twinned once upon a time
we know each other pretty well we decided
to call off the whole thing for good

  the supreme general was too dazed even
to hrrrmph

 but we announced the destruction of
europia he bellowed by broadcast
weve been made fools of

nphis brought a smile to joes lips

jh the generals in europia are just as
bad off he said gently they went out on
a limb too but im telling you what has to
happen youve got to make peace igor and
i have made a compact if anything happens
to him ill use the ky- he stopped and
smiled faintly fu use the device i was
brought to washington to use he will keep
his country from using a similar device as
long as hes alive when hes dead it will be
necessary to smash europia unless peace
is absolutely certain forever

  furthermore if anything happens to me
hell do the same thing for the same patriotic
reason every other weapon is stalemated
remember and igor and i have done trivial
things to our machines that nobody else
would be likely to understand they could
never make the machines work again

the twitching man was ashen-faced now

what-what are we going to do he de-

manded in a trembling voice we-we- 
youre going to make peace said joe
gently even if it costs your party the next
election youre going to make peace be-
cause you cant make war europia is in the
same predicament as long as igor and i are
both alive youre going to bave peace wheth-
er you like it or not

  he turned and walked quietly toward the
door nobody tried to stop him they were
still too dazed he stopped in the doorway
merely a pleasant-faced civilian and by no
means as impressive as the generals or even
the statesmen

  wouldnt someone like to say long live
joe carnahan he asked mildly



  in the hired car going back to his labora-
tory he felt igors thoughts touching his
mind again and he grinned he knew igor
was grinning too

  theyre going crazy over here said igor
comfortably now they say ive bet the life of
my country on my own life oh their raging
but the american broadcasts were picked
up and they know i told them the truth
weve got to find some way to make peace
sure no matter what happens to us joe
the blue ridge rose up like a rampart
against the sky ahead all about was rolling
country nice country unravaged and beau-
tiful to look at and smell and feel the car
he had been using now had no escort of staff
cars or attending generals

  ive been thinking bixby twinner you
remember picked up the consciousness of
the one who wore it and transmitted to its
matched companion ive got an idea that
we could pick up consciousness without a
twinner pick up the consciousness of indi-
vidual people and there should be a way
to let tbem be broadcast so everybody could
receive them without twinners

  he stopped thinking in words the two
of them were one brain his thoughts leaped
ahead and joe carnahan knew that his
friend igor vladek far away in europia
was shaking with mirth as he savored the
devastating possibilities in the new device
joe proposed

  it was a new weapon an invincible wea-
pon joe proposed to give to the american
government a perfect weapon to enforce
peace and secure justice it was a weapon
that would destroy any foreign government
overnight

travelers tale

 by george whitley

      a man comes out of time to paidis village-and is
      shocked to realization of the truth of his journey

the bitter wind swept down the valley
bringing with it flurries of sleet pardi
shivered a little in the deep folds of his
dogskin robe and stared resentfully at the
bleak gray sky unconsciously tightening
his grip on his metal-tipped spear

  as hereditary priest of the tribe he was
supposed to be able to exercise a certain
control over the weather-but he knew well
that such supernatural powers as were



ascribed to him existed only in the minds of
the more credulous of his flock the others
most of the men and-even-some of the
women treated him with a half contemp-
tuous tolerance

 pardi wrenched his mind away from the
distasteful track that it was following and
thought instead-it did not require much
effort-of the warm crackling fire in his
hut where muri his wife awaited him
	startling stories

  what a fool he had been not to let one of
the acolytes keep todays watch and yet-
somehow he knew that this was the day
on which the traveler would come to answer
all the questions that had for so long trou-
bled the wise men of the tribes

  the priest found shelter of a sort in the
lee of one of the strange grass-covered
mounds which in almost regular array cov-
ered the floor of the valley from this van-
tage point he could watch the circle that
weird inexplicable phenomenon that had
been there since before the memory of the
oldest man that was according to tribal lore
older than the race itself without end and
without beginning

  the highway of the gods men said it was
or as some said-and this legend had al-
ways persisted among the priesthood-the
highway of the great sorcerers of men like
gods

  it was always calm within the circle
although the air within its bounds had a
sort of quivering tenseness neither rain
nor snow neither dust nor mist seemed able
to cross the magic frontier that divided the
circle from the everyday world

  a man though could enter its charmed
limits men had done so and these men
had died without exception stricken by
some strange ailment that defiei all the skill
of the tribes medicine men

  they had died raving in their last delirium
of thundering fire from the earth leaping to
meet screaming fire from the sky of great
stone huts piled one upon the other crash-
ing in blazing ruin of monstrous birds mak-
ing the heavens their battlefield and diving
in incandescent death

  perhaps thought pardi when i am very
old i shall enter the circle but not yet
life is not good neither is it bad but i
should like to see these wonders before i
die

  down the wind came a longdrawn eerie
ululation the hunting cry of the wild dogs
was it cattle they were hounding or was
it some luckless man or woman the priest
mumbled a half-believed invocation to his
dim gods prayed that the pack would not
come his way

  they were devils these dogs man they did
not fear and more often than not their cun-
ning was more than a match for his weapons
his clumsy but cruel traps

  pardi breathed a sigh of relief as the
menacing sound died away in the distance

 then-he caught his breath in sudden
panic

  had the pack or had another pack crept
unobserved up the valley that new shrill
whining was never the wind neither the
priest realized after a long moments agon-
ized apprehension was it made by any ani-
mal it came from inside the circle

tther savages would have turned and
fled but not pardi like so many of
his cloth in all ages and all countries he
was not superstitious besides this was the
moment to which he had been dedicated he
and pardi his father and pardi his father
for untold centuries in the dim past of the
tribe

  this must surely be the advent of the
traveler

  within the circle danced a lambent blue
flame waxing and waning as the volume
of the sound rose and fell at times it was
almost invisible then again it would flare to
eye-searing brilliance

  had it been a fire such as pardi knew he
would have felt its warmth from where he
stood but there was no heat nothing but
that uncanny dancing light that made the
dark valley seem more than ever a place
of gloom and desolation

  dim outlines shaped themselves within
the pale flickering fire the shadow of what
appeared to be a sort of a cage or skeleton
framework behind the weaving rods was
the figure of a man ghostly as yet insub-
stantial as the snow wraiths that whirled
down the valley yet gaining substance with
every passing moment

  abruptly the blue light flared for a last
time and steadied to constant intensity at
the same time the noise of the fire reached
an unbearably high almost supersonic pitch
and thereafter was audible only as a thin
high whistle

  as pardi stared fascinated by that in-
tricate complexity of bars and rods no longer
in motion but seeming to draw the vision
down through untold interminable vistas
of space and time the traveler stepped from
the heart of his singing flame and stood just
inside the circle gazing about him with
a certain bewilderment

  strange- pardi heard him mutter can
it be the heisenberg uncertainty principle
the instruments shouldnt cant lie but
ive certainly come the wrong way

  the priest stored the strange expressions
travelers tale	

in his memory they must he decided be
words of power or perhaps the traveler
was offering thanks to his strange gods

  meanwhile the traveler had returned to
his strange hut of magic rods was peering
at certain small white circles affixed to a
flat board on the side furthest away from
pardi once again he came into the open
this time stepping outside the borders of
the circle

  he was pardi saw of about his own
height but with the smooth face of a woman
or boy he was clothed in what seemed to
be garments of some woolen weave but of
a texture infinitely finer than that made by
the women of the tribe from the poor fleece
of the little half-wild sheep

  a strange framework resting on the
bridge of his nose covered the upper part of
his face this held before the travelers
eyes two little round windows filled with
some transparent substance like ice

  and the man himself he was pardi de-
cided of the type that in this day filled
the ranks of the priesthood given gar-
ments like pardis he would have passed for
pardis brother this then was no god but
some great sorcerer

  a faint pale ghost of the steady flame
within the circle still clung to the traveler
seeing him glowing thus wanly luminous
against the dark background of the valley
the priest felt more than half inclined to
revise his original opinion

  the searching eyes behind those little icy
windows found pardi

  good heavens cried the traveler a
stone age man hope hes not hostile i
wonder if i can persuade him to come back
with me but how

  pardi spoke

  you are the traveler he said

it wasnt a question it was a statement
there was a certain awe a suspicion of
reverence in the tones in which it was said
-but it was not the superstitious terror
that one would expect from an ignorant
savage

  rather it was as though one professional
man were addressing another far superior
in rank and qualifications but still no more
than a practitioner of the same art

  the traveler stiffened as does the wild
dog when the arrow finds the mark he
stared at the priest with even greater won-
derment than that with which pardi was

regarding him

  yes he said at last i am a traveler
out of time you were expecting me
of course has not the circle the high-
way of the great sorcerers been here since
before the beginning of time

  before the gods that made the gods had
drunk at dawn their fill quoted the traveler
softly

  you know the ritual shouted pardi
excitedly then you are indeed one of us
and now i know that my sons sons or
their sons will be sorcerers such as you
with power undreamed of but this is heart-
ening news

  for year by year we few holders of the
ancient wisdom see that same wisdom fade
much my father told me and much i have
forgotten my sons too will forget and
it seems that as we of the tribes sink into
the swamp of not-knowing so our enemies
the dogs and the rats grow fiercer and
more cunning

  my father told me that there was a tribe
only two days march from my village last
warm season when the days are long our
young men-we have so few women now
-set out to visit them they found their
empty huts and the ashes of their fires and
their bones

  so friend-how do they call you pardi
so friend pardi i have brought you hope
of that i am glad even though my-magic
did not work properly and sent me the
wrong way in time my journey has not been
fruitless perhaps i have changed the course
of history

  i will tell you the truth i too was
seeking aid in my time there are certain
evil men who would rule the world and
there is raging a battle of sorcerers our
magic against theirs

  i thought that at some time in the fu-
ture i would find magicians even more
clever than ourselves who would put into
our hands weapons with which we could
save the world

  a battle of sorcerers broke in pardi
eagerly then the old tales are true
what old tales

  now and again a bold man has entered
the circle and he has died

  you mean that there is a tabu

  tabu what is that he must have
read the others meaning in his eyes no
we did not kill them they died

  -how


startling stories

  they shone with pale cold fire just as
you are doing but not so brightly the
traveler looked down at his hands with
shocked surprise and they seemed to waste
away and they told stories of what they
had seen within the circle

  what did they see demanded the trav-
eler his voice urgent

  fire from the earth leaping to meet fire
from the sky great stone huts piled hut on
hut to the height of twenty or more tum-
bling down in flames huge birds fighting
all along the sky

the traveler had paled but his manner
was icy calm he had drawn from a
pouch in his clothing a little bundle of
white sheets bound around with what
looked like leather on these sheets he was
making marks with a little pointed stick
what else he asked what else
nothing only pictures of people like us
dressed like us and of course now and
again a pack of dogs

  it could be said the traveler slowly
it could be but now that i have come
back to this forgotten age i must have
altered history instead of an a b c d
sequence it will be a plus x b plus x
and so on-with myself as x but tell me
about yourself pardi you are a priest i
take it

  yes

  what is your god

  there are many gods but i serve arp
  the pencil scribbled on

 and then having at last drawn from
pardi his pitiful stock of half-forgotten
knowledge his rather greater accumulation
of tribal lore and history the traveler
talked

  he talked of all the wonders that would
be of huge floating cities crossing the great
waters at speeds beyond the priests com-
prehension of great mechanical birds that
would make the most distant lands lands
undreamed of by pardi within the compass
of a days march

  and of these same lands he talked lands
where it was always summer where great
luscious fruit hung ripe and ready for the
plucking from every tree and where there
were strange men whose skins were yellow
black or brown

  and he concluded men were even reach-
ing out towards the very stars the world
was theirs and all the fullness thereof were

there not fresh worlds for conquest in the
sky

  all this was meat and drink to pardi he
would never see these things-but his sons
would or their sons and he who had
viewed the slow seemingly inevitable decay
of the race with unrelieved pessimism now
allowed himself to dream of the bright
distant future

  but the traveler seemed anxious at in-
creasingly frequent intervals he raised his
wrist to glance at a little device strapped
thereon

  i must be getting back he said at last

  i wish you could stay with us replied
pardi

  i do too but i also have a wife who is
waiting for me and if i delay my return
much longer i shall be marooned here for-
ever

 but why

  how can i explain you have bows and
arrows havent you well my time ma-
chine has stretched the very structure of-
things just as your arm will stretch the
string of a bow but your arm will tire
sooner or later you must release the string

 besides- once again the traveler
raised his hand but this time to look with
apprehension at the pale radiance emanat-
ing from his flesh

  before you go said pardi there is a
little custom among my people the ex-
change of gifts i should- he fumbled for
words

  of course said the traveler but-

  he ran his hands through his pockets
seeking something that would be of value
to the other nothing but wait-his watch
it was of metal and its strap was of metal
and it would therefore be immune to the
slow decay and disintegration of atomic
structure affecting any organic matter com-
ing within the influence of the time machine

  here he said it is a device for telling
the passage of time every day you must
wind it-so and it will have to be set like
this do this on a sunny day at high noon

  inside the time machine a red light was
flashing and a little bell was ringing

pardi took the proffered gift his face
that of one who has received an acco-
lade words failed him mutely he thrust
the haft of his spear into the travelers
hands with an expression of thanks it was
taken the traveler examined it looking
travelers tale



curiously at the workmanship and crude
feeble attempts at ornamentation

  but what is this he cried pointing at
the head

  that oh it is a kind of stone we find
in the ground some is good and some is
eaten away with a sort of red rottenness
we even find some already shaped into
things some useful and some the use of
which is beyond our ken my wife muri has
a fine cooking pot of this ringing stone do
you know what it is then

  this is manganese steel

  what a fool i was thought the traveler
the instruments didnt couldnt lie and it
all dovetails so perfectly pardi an obvious
corruption of padre those regular mounds
that can only be ruins and-most obvious
of all-a common language that was too
obvious-so obvious that i never even no-
ticed it

  he would have liked to have shaken hands
with the priest but feared that his strange
affliction might prove contagious

  goodby he said and good luck

  you will return

  i am afraid not he looked again at his
glowing hands he was afraid very much
afraid but what did it matter

  before you go pardis voice was in-
sistent tell me-how long must my sons
and their sons and their sons wait before
all the wonders of which you spoke come to
pass

  but i dont- began the traveler then
checked himself why shatter the dream of
this primitive idealist many generations
he lied ten at the very least then again
goodby

  slowly he entered the charmed confines
of the circle for a moment he stood among
the intricacies of his machine hand upraised
in a gesture of farewell it seemed to pardi
then that he touched something on the
board

  the red fight ceased flashing there was
nothing

	   

  it was very dark in the valley and it was
snowing hard pardi stared hardly able to
believe his eyes the floor of the circle the
highway of the gods was already coated
with a thin powdering of white there was
no longer anything to distinguish it from
the rest of the valley it was as though it
had never existed

  pardi mourned for his friend-for the rit-
ual exchange of gifts had a significance un-
dreamed by the traveler yet even as he
mourned he wished that he had buried his
spear in the travelers heart as he set foot
outside the circle for he had given pardi
dreams-and then had shattered those
dreams

  he had not even lied convincingly

  it would have been kinder too for him
mused the priest for i with my spear with
its head of the ringing stone slew his
dreams  

  abruptly he turned away from the place
of the circle

  the travelers gift unheeded still clutched
in his right hand he began the long trudge
back to the unloved and unlovely squalor of
his home

  out of the night came the approaching
cry of a hunting pack

  it was very cold and dark

friends

concluded from page 

  it was a device that would enable the
american government to pick up and broad-
cast to the people of europia exactly what the
rulers of europia were thinking with such
complete transmission of those rulers con-
sciousness that the people of europia would
know absolutely that there was no fake
about it

 and igor would give exactly the same
weapon to his own government to reveal to
the people of america the most private
thoughts of their legislators and political
lights

  that weapon would be more deadly than
armies more annihilating than atomic

bombs no government on earth could stand
after the exposure of its members private
thoughts and this weapon made every other
weapon too deadly to be used because the
use of any other weapon might provoke re-
taliation by this

  joe carnahan smiled as igor shook with
laughter ten thousand miles away he and
igor were twinned again they were friends
as two people had never been friends before
though theyd never seen each other in the
flesh and never would

  riding back to his laboratory joe carn-
ahan felt a warm inner satisfaction he
would never be lonely again

  and now to the summer issue of startling stories

  i wont say anything was wrong with the cover
bergey is a good artist most of the time but his
themes are fl shot and some wliai of a discrace but
you wont change so why kick could you tell me if
the part of the story the cover illustrated was written
in after the cover was done the action wasnt very
importen and had little bareing on the rest yet it
fited the cover so well would be a reather good
idea while i am asking oupshons how about telling
me how her clothes got riped in just the right places
and oh yes how do you get into that time world

  say who did the drawing on page  it looks a
little like finley im not up on pro-artist but this
is one of the best pics you have had in a coupe years
the one on page  coming a close second who did
it and keep who ever it was great your other
man harchion i believe is not so good he uses
a t-square to much but at least we are used to him

  they story by kuttner was of course good you
expect his to be how anyone can write that much
and still be good is bevond me it was a little bff-
trail but very nice i oersormlly thought there was
something lacking in the ending but it wasnt any-
thing and my friends disagreed with me saying it
was a swell ending

  none of the shorts were outstanding this time
they had a few good ideas and werent bad reading
but there was no meat in them rocklynnes idea was
reather new more than you can say for cross tho
he hand- it well the hall of fame ggaapffffft
ethergrams

  so the mighty joke is back well good but dont
tell us he got that all on two pages the rest of ther
letter were pretty good david olson is a real promis-
ing letter hack if i thought you meant what you said
about my letter puting you on the brink of the scream-
ing-meemles id come back and give you a push

  only remark i want to make about the fanzine
review is the way you handled maxin  i dont
have a copy but i have heard about it how you could
be so nasty and yet not name names was wonderful
only a fn could understand what you meant i think
you handled it very nicely better than some would

  before i go how about a letter contest huh give
a pic to the best letter just one pic even huh why
not

  oh yes i see wellman is bringing captain future
back next issue i hope it is good some of cf arent
and wellman has such a style of his own he is good
but  his big sute if picturing the viewpoint of
other races i hope this next story dont drop into
that kine of thing cf has to much of a thud and
blunder past for such a thing not that it might not
be better-ricfe sneary  santa ana st south
gate calif

 at first we thought it was a gag but
brother sneary had the improvidence to send
along a postcard asking us to let him know
whether the letter was to be used et cetera
one of the check-off questions was are
there to many misspellingsr

 the answer is self-evident well weve
always wanted to run a fan letter as is to let
you literateurs and literateuses know why we
are only allowed out of our straightjacket for
five-minute intervals every hour on the hour
in the iron lung incidentally rick thanks
for the plug on our handling of the maxin
horror and dont cut english classes this year
if only for our sake

strictly union
by raymond f hass

  dear sgt saturn-this is my first letter to any
magazine but as this is a free country i am going to
express a gripe that i hope will end all gripes i am
getting sick and tired fed-up and generally nauseated
from reading some of these self-appointed wouldbe
humorouscritics for -s sake if chad oliver joe
kennedy rick sneary howard gabriel-etc ad
nauseum dont like the stf fiction magazines they
buy why do they waste their pennies in buying the
magazines and then spending postage panning their
purchases it reminds me of the hound-dog howling
about sitting on a sand-burr and being too lazy to get
off it

  i	for one do not need some egotistical kindergarten
undergraduate exhibitionist to air his labored unfunny
remarks concerning his uninteresting reactions to the
world to guide me in what i want to read if kennedey
and all the rest of the knockers club must see their
names in print why dont they write a story or draw
a few illustrations and earn renown instead of noto-
riety honest effort pays off better than panning your
betters

  if you do not know your job as an editor any better
than to need help from such a bunch get off it for a
better man i dont think that is the case or i and
several thousand more fans would not be buying read-
ing and enjoying nearly everything you select and
print for us

  if you must have a letter-section which wastes the
space that could be much better employed in printing
another story why not have letters where the writers
have something to say and say it without trying to
act like a five-year-old acting-up in front of com-
pany but for heavens sake if you have a contract to
publish the effusions of some of these wish-they-were-
funny men publish a magazine call it morons de-
light and let them continue to see their names in
print print their pictures with their letters and i
imagine that your bem problem would be solved

  i read practically all of the scientific fiction maga-
zines published and in every one that has a letter-
section some one or more of these birds are smelling
up the ether with their so-called humor it has long
passed the boiling-point and the above is the re-
action- e borley ave mishawaka ind

  the author of this epistle is according to
his letterhead financial-treasurer seems a
trifle redundant does it not of united
musicians local industrial union no 
cio south bend indiana

  as for his differentiation between honest
effort and the noble art of panning our bet-

what makes
writing ability grow

  for a number of years the newspaper institute of amer-
ica has been giving free writing aptitude tests to men and
women with literary ambitions

  sometimes it seems half the people in america who are
fired with the desire to write have taken advantage of this
offer to measure their ability

           ithat the tests shoto

  up to date no one who could be called a born writer
has filled out our writing aptitude test we have not yet
discovered a single individual miraculously endowed by
nature with all the qualities that go to make up a suc-
cessful author

  one aspirant has interesting ideas-and a dull uninter-
esting style another has great creative imagination but is
woefully weak on structure and technique a third has a
natural writing knack-yet lacks judgment and knowledge
of human behavior in each case success can come only
after the missing links have been forged in

  here then is the principal reason why so many promis-
ing writers fail to go ahead their talent is one-sided-
incomplete it needs rounding out

learn to write by writing

tvtewspapeb institute training is based on journalism-eontlnu-
ous writing-tbo sort of training that turns out more successful
writers than any other experience many of the authors of todays
best sellers are newspaper-trained men and women

  one advantage of our new york copy desk method is that it starts
you writing and keeps you writing in your own home on your own
time wech by week you receive actual assignments just as if you
were right at work on a great metropolitan daily

   all your writing is individually corrected and criticised by vctctan
writers with years of experience breaking in new authors they
will point out those faults of style struc-
ture or viewpoint that keep you from pro-
gressing at the samo time they will giro
you constructive suggestions for building up
and developing your natural aptitudes

in fact so stimulating is this associa-
tion that student-members often begin to
sell their work before they finish the course

we do not mean to lnsinuato that they sky-
rocket into the big money or become
prominent overnight most beginning are
made with earnings of    or
more for material that takes little time to
write - stories articles on business hob-
bles sports travels local and club activi-
ties etc-things that can easily be turned
out in leisure hours and often on the
impulso of the moment

	startling stories

ters it leaves us at a loss the world knows
how difficult it is to pay an honest compli-
ment with aplomb and no verbal falling over
ones own shoelaces

 but the world also knows that every knock
is a boost therefore since a slap in the puss
and a verbal laudation rate equally panning
the be-whathaveyou out of anyone should
certainly come under the honest effort head-
ing

ugh ugh

by millard grimes

 dear sarge ugh the preceding is an accurate
word description of the latest bergey monstrosity
adorning the cover of startling i thought i had seen
some bad frontispieces but this one takes all the cake
i see bergey has invented a new type of bem or do
you call that erstwhile veronica lake a woman

  there are also a bunch of lams in the picture
note that word lams it is term i have invented for
bergeys long-armed monsters-long armed mems
i expect to receive much credit for this unique new
expression henceforth fans will have night-mares
about bems and-also lams

  you really had a swell vibrating of the ether this
time sarge kennedys letter was a masterpiece
another satire that i found enjoyable was olsons
analysis of the march cover will look forward to
seeing his analysis of present cover

  as to your own questions i definitely think you
should continue as the seargent from saturn your
impersonation gives the mag color and it also makes
it unique in having a different type of letter section
in a way when you think of startling you always
think of sarge and the boys nope the book wouldnt
be quite the same without you

  finally getting around to stories we find that dark
world is as good as you claim as far as writing is
concerned yep to me it was a powerful tale full of
power that is

  i especially liked the scenes when ganelon was in the
tower of ghast rymi and in the chamber of lyr my
only objection is -that it was fantasy im touchy but
i like to see only sf in startling hall of famer was
best since isle of unreason yep hamilton wrote it
too your shorts are really improving- tenth
street columbus georgia

 well thanks millard in spite of the un
kind cuff at bergeys semi-bald pate inci
dentally off him it looks good

snaggies pal

by james patton

  dear sarge yesterday i went into a news stand
ah ss summer issue is here i hastily put down the
money and went home then i turned to the ether
vibrates horrors unthinkable the sarge asks us if
he should shut up snaggie froggie warty and throw
away the xeno

 no

 then comes the next paragraph asking whether
things should stay the same

 yes

  hmm the next paragraph suggests a compromise

  no

  gee whiz why ever ask such questions just go to
a news stand and buy some other s f mag turn to
the readers department does any other editor spend
time answering poem for poem or answer each letter
printed there with a paragraph or two no ss 
tavs are distinguished from other magazines because
they have fantasy even in the readers department
xeno wart ears etc

  they print in ss  tws drawings the fans make
of sarge does any other editor print a fans sketch of
him no lets keep sargeant saturn the way he is
that is my vote and you other fans write in and tell

sarge you want him to stay with all the trimmings
lets keep ss  tws with their mark of distinc-
tion sargeant saturn i really enjoy the sargea
comments and poems the mag just wouldnt seem the
same without him so everyone vote for sgt saturn

  now the stories the dark world by kuttner was
terrific and you fans that yell about tthe cover
well this time i couldnt see anything that didnt fit
the story and as for how the cover looked well she
looked all right i saw the man too

  and now the short stories the vicious circle by
polton cross should be made a hall of fame classic
i liked the man with the x-ray eyes least of the
short stories the others were about equal but it was
good oh oh somebody will fuss about the illustra-
tion for the man with the x-ray eyes because it
says underneath he heard- well we know he was
lip reading but to have explained it there would have
made the sentence longer and there is an ink shortage
there is isnt there

  and to you sarge i send a can of dehydrated xeno
as good luck toward the outcome of the poll-route

	clovis new mexico

 with a rueful glance at the dehydrated
xeno the sarge bows low in welcome to
neophyte james patton who surely is a king
among men a peerless judge of wine women
horseflesh symphonic music gutbucket and
res scientifictionae

  but since we have cast the die toward com-
promise measures we can only promise to
stay in there lorn perhaps without our grem-
lins and pitch were still giving poem for
poem anyway and when enough reprehensi-
ble likenesses of ye sarge turn up we plan
to run them as a separate feature think-an
art gallery of nothing but the sarge or
rather lets not just now

waste ofs pace

by tom pace

  dear sargie you said it letter hacks come and go
but the sarge goes on forever well heres one letter-
hack who came went and is coming back he hopes

  aside from my bewilderment at how you manage to
put such delightful ladies on your covers i have little
no say about the cover

  on the other hand i have a great deal to say about
dark world i am writing to say that in my
august opinion henry kuttner has reached a stature
in the field of imaginative fiction which equals abra-
ham merritts they said that there would never again
be a writer like am they were wrong ill class
dark world with anything merritt ever wrote
except possibly-just possibly-ship of ishtar

  the merritt style is there and the merritt magic
but it is kuttner pure kuttner    and it is great
fantasy better than sword of tomorrow just
as sword of tomorrow was greater than land
of time to come and that greater than earlier
yams    and this shows all the signs of keeping up
for a long long time it seems that kuttner is bringing
on a golden age in fantasy  all by himself

  skoal

  jack vance returns with a neatly done tale of space
piracy very polished and neat indeed and the hero
is as enthusiasticly a pirate as the villain hooray

  extra earth is typical of the new ross rock-
lynne it could so easily be an extremely tired hack-
neyed tales    but is anything but darned good

  the man with x-ray eyes while quite a good
yam for its time belongs in a  stf mag exactly as
much as a ford tin goose belongs on a modem
airline

  the vicious circle has been written exactly
four thousand three hundred and eighty-two times

  the pix for dark world were the best in the
ish who did them oh editor they remind me of
lawrence

  and as for the blurb on jack vances tale   -per-
 when illness or injury strikes
 the new national policy

sonally t say that robert holderlin was the oilly
card-holder in that game the most admirable buc-
caneer ive run into in stf he had the deck stacked
pretty much to suit himself simon templar himself
couldnt have done better

  speaking of the saint i recently ran across a saint-
collection of stf stories from tws under the name of
impossible crime i note that charteris opinion of
trophy rivalled my admiration for this    one of
the best shorts i have ever read and i also kick my-
self for not guessing kuttner to be the author   
hmmm

  there were three hk stories in that ish of tws

  hey sarge    wonder if you could talk charteris
into writing us an stf tale    with or without the
saint

 hm

  xeno again    always xeno since you are a
native of a world which has produced such things as
cognac brandy jamaican rum creme de menthe or
champagne why must you drink stuff like that let
me mix you a pink lady sarge  or an angels
kiss or a pousse cafi  i bet youll never drink
xeno again    

  to repeat    hank kuttner is certainly making up
for service-spent time

  there was larry okeefe    and one called lakia
the handmaiden there was leif langdon-dwayanu
and evalie and lur the witch-woman there were
kenton and sharane of the ship    and those are
things that will be written of no more worlds that
are lost for he who wrote is no more   

  but now there is bond-ganelon and medea and
arles    and there will be others

  i am waiting to read of them

  do thou oh editor perceive the hint-brewster
florida

 the hint has already been took watch
for lands of the earthquake tom
in the issue after next-and more are com-
ing

  trying to bring leslie the c into stf is a
great deal like a bread rationer ordering
bakers yeast not to rise he does as he
pleases and always has and putting the
saint into a time-machine would be a little
like having a plumber start out with his tools
it simply isnt done

 however thanks for the letter we like

brief brief from belton

by joe hayhurst

  dear sergeant just a line to let you know that i
thought the dark world was really swell it re-
minded me of merritts creep shadow creep a
story like that is really refreshing after some of the
hack that we wade through

  i see where a guy named wellman is writing a
captain future story seems like everybody is writing
about captain future think ill write one too

  the vicious circle and planet of the black
dust were also very nice and im looking forward to
after armageddon

  the cover was all right but it wasnt what it
could be if mr bergey wouldnt try to make his
covers so blinding and a little more artful you would
have a better cover the girl on the cover i assume
it was arles wasnt much like the same in the story
but ive gotten used to such discrepancies

  sarge is the s-f league dead and if it isnt why
doesnt it do something-bel ton texas

  the science fiction league is indeed in-
active at present and dont worry about
wellman-he can go with the best of them
am cutting this reply short because another
poem looms ahead and the sarge needs all
his mental muscle to cope with same

we bring it out

 by miss lee budoff

northwestern school of taxidermy
ocpt 	omaha nebraska jq

   dear sarge i dont know what youve got that does
 it but you seem to bring out the poet in stf fans
 x feel after gazing at one of mr bergeys colorful
 creations that i must try my hand at it therefore x
 present a poem upon a subject dear to the hearts of
 all of us

   the bern with apologies to hilaire belloc

       earl bergeys covers can be seen
       on startling stories magazine

       his heroines with flaming tresses
       wear natures clothing for their dresses
       red-suited heroes eye their stems

       their weapons spitting death at bems

      ah bems those legendary ones
      expressly made for heroes guns

       their jointed tongues that lie beneath
       a hundred curious rows of teeth

       their seven lufted tails with lots
       of lovely pink and purple spots

       their eyes bulge out like telescopes
       on stalks that look like slimy ropes

      and bergey one who ought to know

       assures us that theyre really so

       perhaps hes seen his darlings frolic
       in nightmares wild and alchoholic

      oh let us gaze in raptured awe
      at bems that bergey swears he saw

   thats enough about that but speaking more
 seriously when i see whats becoming of some other
 stf mags on the market i cling with relief to
 startling which has the distinction of retaining a con-
 sistently level quality and style as far as fiction is
 concerned but whatever is wrong with it i say stf
 forever as long as some people have some imagina-
 tion it will always be popular- schenectady
 avenue brooklyn  new york

     with such a perfect hunk of verse
     you drive the sarge from bad to worse
     in very truth it do seem blest
     with everything but anapest
     with assyrians wolfiing the fold by the
     way

     and byron succeeded by edna
     st vincent millay
     the ode to bemry speaking casually
     is keats urn in lapis lazuli
     for bems in all scientifiction
     may not be noted for their diction
     yet stand they solid like a rock
     with no apologies to hilaire belloc

     so dress the sarge in fine spondee
     to meet this lady fi om avenue
     schenectady

  brother

where is joke
by jim kennedy

   dear sarge is bergy nuts he put out a good cover
 for once there were a few screwy items about the
 summer cover but it was fair certainly better than
 the one on the march issue i thought that the type
 of gun that shot smoke rings was reserved for captain
 future as for the girl herself not a bad shape but
 that two-piece bathing suit with the robin hood cap
 and the veronica lake hair style sort of spoiled tilings
 otherwise the cover was good except for those trees
 if thats what you call them

   the dark world was fair but it was one of kuttners
 best the hall of fame classic the man with the
 x-ray eyes was fair but not up to par for edmond

  i dont know why i keep writing to you i never
get any of my letters published it seem that you
have a grudge on the name kennedy sarge but
as i read the ether vibrates i see that at least one
kennedy is getting the breaks as joe kennedy blasts
his way back after a long absence also there is the
usual toot from gabriel

  i see that captain future is coming back next issue
but whats this i thought that captain future was
strictly a edmond hamilton-brett sterling publica-
tion how come manly wade wellman is taking over
this issue speaking of the story enough is enough
captain future has beaten u quorn twice and yet we
find u quorn still alive and fighting well at least
lets do away with him this issue

  speaking of captain future when is he going to
quit wandering in and out ss and get back in his own
magazine and if any the readers have any capt
future mags for sale let me know i need all
captain future magazines except the magician of
mars the lost world of time magic moon and
days of creation-summit city california

 thanks for your interest in the ever-
intrepid curt newton and his satellites jim
and incidentally what gives with the dark
world was fair but it was one of kuttners
best a wolf remark if ever we heard one
please elucidate and at any rate you
crashed into print this time good letter too

ah veronica

by robert k pavlat

  dear sarge pardon me sarge but since when has
veronica lake been appearing on the cover of
startling the body the face the red hair didnt
belong to veronica but the hair-do was hers that
finished lets compare the girl in the story and the
girl on the cover  a girl in a tunic the color of
earth and forest her black hair swung upon her
shoulders at least thats how mr kuttner described
her

  sarge if you insist on keeping bergey as your cover
artist and if bergey insists upon painting his covers
without reading the story cant you at least change
the story so that it describes the girl that bergey has
decided would look nice on the cover

  you asked for a decision as to the life expectancy
of wart-ears snaggie and frogeyes so here it is

in many long years of reading startling i have be-
come more or less immune to the charms of vour
three hateful little monstrosities so just tone them
down somewhat i think wed all miss the boys if
they were entirely removed from the scene but they
do deserve a rest

  seeing that a general clean-up is forthcoming how
about fixing up your covers i like women as well as
you and bergey do but how can a man appreciate
them when theyre painted in the hybrid colors that
bergey uses a space-ship cover would be ap-
preciated as would a few covers by new artists how
about getting the artist that did the drawings for the
dark world to do a cover or two his drawing on
page  was dam good wonder who he is

  as for the stories in the july issue of startling ill
just list them in order of preferance no remarks added

  the dark world- the vicious circle extra
earth the man with the x-ray eyes and the
planet of the black dust pretty bad pickings this
time all except the dark world were poor

  that seems to cover almost everything except the
ether vibrates which was in pretty good shape this
time speaking of the ether vibrates brings to
mind mr joe kennedy im going out pluto way be-
fore long and if i can find his frozen body out there
ill bring it back and set it up to show people what
happens to bad poets if i cant find his body ill stop
liking his letters and poetry- forty-third avenue

   we like space-ships too brother parlat but
 not as well as pretty women-in pictures
 anyway and if you find kennedy tell him
 all is forgiven and for the love of pete to
 write us some more of his inimitable inanity

 kidding he says

 by lin carter

  dear sarge faster than a speeding rocket more
  powerful than a jovian dinosaur able to leap tall
  stories in a single bound    its the green grul-
  zak

  yes the green grulzak who is in reality mild man-
  nered little haversham cringenagle avenger of in-
  justice crusher of crime and tyranny and pants
  pressed while you wait

  as we last left the green grulzak he was facing his
  arch-enemy ul-corn the green grulzak speaks
  aha he observes coyly well thats all for now
  fellows and gurrls-but listen in tomorrow for
  chapter  deadly dungeons of dire despair all
  this front stuff is merely a steal on the blue bern

  but honest sarge to get down to brass tacks this
  ish was one of the best youve ever had and so
  without further ado lets sashay forward to   

 the dark world-

  magnif superb hyper one of the five best stories
  ever in startling in my estimation hank does as
  you say write similar to merritt

 the man with x-rav eyes-

  ed hamilton mah ideal is not quite at his best
  here im sorry to say

 planet of the black dust-

  pretty good it reminded me of old-time stf-and the
  pic was excellent

 the vicious circle-

  fair i kinda liked the idea it would have made a
  swell novel

 extra earth-

  the story was in words of endearing charm foul

 the ether vibrates-

  pretty fair chad oliver mildred grimes howard
  gabriel joe kennedy etc helped a lot speaking of
  jokennedy thanks for the kind comments joe com-
  ing from you its a real compliment

  a cap future in the next ish eh swell what   
  by manly wade wellman whats wrong with hamil-

  and so my ire has risen gad what a vocabulary
  and i have cooled it with a poem-sarge i stop
  screaming

         sargeant saturn youre a louse

        an xeno-guzzling souse

         i say to ghu with you

         warty froggy snaggy too

sargeant you should be in fetters

         you didnt print my last two letters

         for this there is no excuse

         unless your brains are slightly loose

        so sarge you may soon expect

        an atom bomb to come collect

the end

   course im just kidding sarge i believe i speak
 for all fandom when i say that i certainly want you
 to continue as you always have i pause to wipe away
 a reminiscent tear

   well thats all this time sarge keep up the good
 work and remember sargeant saturn spelt back-
 wards is tnaegras nrutas  no other space-dog
 can make that statement--th ave so st

we wiggle our eras

by john cockroft

  dear sarge at least a new era in science fiction is
at hand one of your competiters brashly made this
claim a little over a year or so ago it seems however
that it was his own personal claim his and a bunch of
crackpots who remembered lemuria that so
called new era could hardly pass under the guise of
stf

  but enough of this i didnt write in to start up
this joker all over again you know all about it al-
ready the real reason for this note is to express
my heart felt thanks to you for printing the dark
world in the latest ish of startling i believe that i
can say with all sincerity and truthfullness that i
have never come across another novel that has held
me in the thralls of suspense and interest as this

  you are fully right for my money at least in
stating that kuttner has taken up where the late abe
merritt left off his style and quality is definitely
comparable to the late master of the genre that is to
a certain point a closer inspection shows consider-
able originality both in thought and in style and
characterization on the part of kuttner to shorten
the matter let us say that what merritt did for
fantasy kuttner is now doing for stf

  if he does only half as well in the future i will be
more than satisfied only now i will think twice be-
fore i slap the nnme of classic upon a story

  i feel that in the new era the trend will be to-
wards finer writing techniques and new methods of
presentation rather than an effort on the editors part
to cause sensationalism by claiming that fiction which
was written as fiction is in reality the truth at least
it is my ferverent hope that this will be so- winship
avenue san anselmo california

 the new era mr cockroft mentions was
announced by the sarge after a squint at
stories ahead-a long way ahead they
seemed to him so far superior to many run in
the last few years that he should i believe
be pardoned for giving vent to a hallelujah
or six or six and seven-eighths at any
rate he is glad one more agrees on the kutt-
ner opus selah

the heavyweight champ

by fred ross burgess

  dear saturn old sarge i got the summer startling
today and as joe says quote humph unquote
as usual the first thing i saw was the cover as
usual he says it was quite startling in fact it
wasnt down to the usual standard really startling
about the only thing wrong with it was all the writing
scrawled all over the pretty picture really all the
low-class people who dont like bergeys work can
shut up now im not even going to raise a fuss about
the way the girl was dressed henry said she was
dressed in green and he didnt specify whether it
the green stuff was brief n bra or a mother hub-
bard im glad he didnt the picture looks better
like it is but sir bergey did cross up kuttners de-

english and believe you me its hard to do that
means the grand and glorous order of fen who
have stopped hollerin about heroines garments
and who now holler about the clothes the men on
the cover wear any person wishing to join will re-
ceive membership by sending me one of the models

you will receive earle bergey himself signed by both

  a gripe why cant all the writers get together on
this captain future stuff  in one ish you kick out of
space a planet smaller than the moon and its loss will
make the sun explode and in another youre going to
get rid of the moon and as far as youve stated
nothingll happen

  another gripe not quite so large in the fall ish
you had a little thing called the dark angel in the
spring episode there was another that went under the
gentle name of the dark planet now in the
summer installment you bring up a thing called the
dark world gets dark early this time of year
doesnt it whatsamattahi are we in a rut er some-
thin maybe next time you might have something
called tlie dark sun or the dark universe or
the dark stfan i quit

  the next thing i can think about here those in-
terior decorations by verne stevens beoteeful his
stuff may have points that ive a minor dislike for
and stuff that i usually try to keep out of my work
types of shading but on the whole he is excel-
lent

 the man with x-ray eyes is just another hof
classic that aint so classic if these hof stories are
the best published back when im glad i only started
a few years ago gad it must o been terrible to have
to read the things and hamilton has improved about
 since this   this so-called classic was
written i like eds stuff a lot but please dont spoil
what fun i get out of reading his stories by printing
such stuff as this

  jack vance brings up planet of the black dust for
my inspection now hm-m-m ham this thing has
a surprise ending and unless you read and think out
every word the darn thing slips by you and you
have to reread the whole story to see what you missed
and im not going to do that

  naxt

  vicious circle it seems that we are having a vicious
circle with all these reincarnation stories incidentally
i got hold of a copy of star-rover the other day and
i assure you it was the biggest disappointment or one
of the biggest ive ever had i thought it would at
least be interesting

  now ill pick the order in which the stories rank
in this case theyre scored on a percentage basis best
story gets highest perecentage worst-lowest now   

title                     author place percentage

     and the little cut on page  contents would have
   gotten about  if it had been in the judging while
   the one on page  might have gotten 

    now going from the humorous to the ghastly we
   find such various feeturz as the ethereal vibrations

    no no no sarge   dont ever leave us
   please

     this is a paid political announcement and does not
   necessarily constitute the views of this station

    but no we do need some humor in this peace-rav-
aged world and dont ever bung the xeno kegs

 what would us poor fellows here on earth do tha
 most potent stuff we can get here is only about  and
  proof good old repulsive  proof xeno of
 course you realize that i dont offer definite proof
 but xeno does

   joe kennedy says he died on pluto the ungrateful
 wretch may his pet grulzaks leave him and never
 return he died on pluto the idea as he was
 staggering in the snow i saw him and just as he fell
 i wheeled about on my run between u ophiuchi and
 krueger  before a quarter of an hour had gone
 by i was at his side forcing life-giving xeno down
 his friz throat and in a few moments his heart he
 does have one yknow started beating again i
 carried him to my cruiser and then although he
 never quite regained consciousness i carried him on
 past earth at that time i didnt think that anything
 that looked like that could be human past krueger
  and on the galaxy i c  roughly 
 light years from our galaxy and some  past
 andromeda

   on one of the major planets there they refused to
 claim him so on my trip back to n g c  in-
 cidentally i left him off on the little planet of kypton
 where the natives found him took pity on him and
 me took him off my hands and raised him i went
 on the n g c  and at present and future and
 coming back to the galaxy via the magellanic
 clouds at present im only  light years from
 earth so if this letter gets here late well and this
 is the reason they never found josephus q kennedys
 body on the sunny planet of pluto

   now joke will probally claim that this aint but he
 doesnt know due to the fact that he was a trifle
 delirious during most of the voyage

   i have solved the problem that bothered so many
 readers i know just which case dave grant opened
 he opened one and found his wife in it and she opened
 the other one and found herself in it she was in both
 cases does that answer mrs bowlings query

   and for that sirius fellow mikeal kook send him
 two gallons of xeno viniger famed for its etc with
 my compliments i did like that crack

   sirius buznez tch

   make it three gallons

   incidentally i lost ron maddoxs new address let
 me know ron

   and sarge old pal old friend old xeno hogshead

meet the
author

author edmond hamilton may prate
of the creation of wonder in his
novel the star of life but to
us he is chiefly the creator of a brand new
caste system guaranteed to drive any fol-
lower of karl marx to the shores of the
nearest cocoanut-shaded island to find a
mate-among the fruits of the trees

   this business of whole new species of hu-
 manity might well have caused the late
 thomas jefferson apostle of human equality
 to lift his bi-focals gently from his pro-
 boscis hurl them to the floor and stamp on
 them as if he were treading grapes in the
 vineyard of monticello

  hamilton-no fool he-ducks the issue
 neatly in his comment on the story but his
 remarks anent other phases of his excellent
 fable are interesting says mr hamilton

   the star of life like most of my science-
 fiction stories is a story of wonder i put the
 word between quotation marks because i would
 like to define what i mean by it

   the quality of wonder has largly disappeared
 from modem literature but centuries ago when
 much of the world was still unexplored it was
 the breath of life to tale-tellers

   it was the emotion aroused by speculation on
 the unknown regions and their possible marvels
 beyond the rim of the horizon lay dreamy
 continents and isles of enchantment-at least
 they might be there

   the old greek literature is full of that fas-
 cination of the unknown from odysseus magic
 islands and platos atlantis down to strabos
 mammoth geography of mythical countries the
 celts brooded on fairy lands in the western sea
 the arab story-tellers affirmed a jinn-haunted
 world lay beyond the desert and even the
 spanish explorers firmly believed in fabled
 golden cities

   all that has faded as the surface of earth
 has become completely known and the last mys-
 teries exposed but there is no reason why it
 should be so out in space lies a vastly larger
 and even more mysterious realm for the im-
 agination to play in

   even the planets of our own star-system are
 still largely unsolved mysteries though we can
 deduce some facts about their physical con-
 ditions but concerning the planets of other
 stars we know absolutely nothing the wildest
interests  most

and most fantastic speculations may well be true
on worlds out there

 even when man finally makes the traverse
to another star as seems inevitable someday in
view of recent scientific progress there will al-
ways be vast regions of mystery and romance
in the almost infinite extent of our galaxy what
i have called wonder will come back into its
own then and i should like to hear some of
the strange tales that will be afloat then about
far-off and unvisited stars

 because the most deep-rooted myth in the
human tradition is that of a golden elysium
where age and death are unknown  am sure
that in that day there will be tales of a fabled
star or world of immortality just as the old
celts dreamed of an island of life in the wes-
tern ocean

  thinking of that it occurred to me that most
of the old fables about such a golden elysium
had generally a tragic twist to them in the case
of the celts the catch in their island of life
was that man remained immortal on it but was
not immune to sickness or age and these in
time so weighed upon him that he was glad in
the end to leave the isle of immortality and sail
to the island of death

  if the star-explorers of the future ever found
such a star or world of immortality would they
too find that it had a catch to it that was the
idea that led me to write the star of life
