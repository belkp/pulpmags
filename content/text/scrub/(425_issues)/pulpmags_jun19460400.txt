the monster screamed his hate and lunged to the attach
the monsters of
voo doo isle

by john peter drummond

a death-trail lured ki-gor to the isle of mists and a god of weird powers
welcomed him his golden mate had already fallen prey to this strange master
-and now the jungle lord would share her fate    become a slavering
mindless creature whose great hands would kill for evil

about the tall lean white man and
the squat thick-bodied black who
trailed at his heels there was an
air of urgency and a certain furtive watch-
fulness

with his carefully tailored clothes his
precise grooming the white man at first

glance was out of place against the wild
primeval backdrop of the congo yet
despite the clearly discernible anxiety that
drove him forward he moved with prac-
ticed assurance along the winding game
trail

  the squat native who served him gave


	jungle

scant attention to the track they followed
even a white man could follow a spoor as
plain as the one they stalked the black
however was as tense and wary as his
master his hard eyes endlessly combed
the jungle walls about them the least
shift in the forests raucous noise pattern
brought him up listening

  plainly the two men hunted but they
were not hunters in the usual sense like-
wise though their tense watchfulness re-
vealed fear of discovery it was not discov-
ery by their quarry but by other men that
they so anxiously sought to avoid

  where the jungle trail sloped down to a
stream crossing they stopped the air
from the hollow rose sweet with the scent
of unnumbered blossoms along the waters
edge scarlet yellow and purple flowers
massed in a riot of color

  the two mens eyes focused on a spot
where the blossoms lay crushed and tram-
pled they studied intently two huge im-
prints in the soft mud of the bank the
footprints were of a size to bring gasps of
amazement from any sportsman

  but the white mans only reaction was a
bitter twist of his lips a dart of anger in
his black unblinking eyes he glanced
accusingly at the native and the black
flinched as though a lash touched him his
eyes belied his suave patrician look
betrayed the thing that linked him in close
brotherhood with the congo in the staring
seething blackness of his eyes was revealed
his blood kinship with this cruel green
world a oneness with the ruthless killer
beasts who stalked the congo trails

  he cannot be far ahead he snapped
when we come on him this time keep your
head his voice was harsh threatening

  yes doktor hastily answered the
native his guttural pronunciation of doc-
tor being uttered with a tinge of awe and
fear the title was voiced like the name of
a deity

  branches snapped and rustled across the
stream a troop of baboons coughing and
barking among themselves swung along
upwind from the two men they headed
through the trees paralleling the trail and
soon moved from view the ill-tempered
tree tribe was out of sight hardly a minute
when their voices harsh with anger rose
in violent stacatto barks

  the white man listened to the clamor

stories

turned inquiringly to the squat native

  some one comes the black replied to
the unspoken question the native knew
from experience only sight of a man aroused
the ugly-tempered baboons to such vio-
lence

  he must not see us warned the doctor
the warrior nodded his right hand
reached almost too eagerly for the bow
hung across his shoulder

  one quiet arrow he promised and
he will see nothing

  no the white man decided leading
the native swiftly behind a concealing
growth of shrubs we must not attract
attention by killing him we might bring
searchers

the two men squatted in hiding sup-
pressing the urge to slap away the
vicious gnats swarming in the foliage
they saw a small sturdy figure come up
to the stream at a soundless trot he was
a pygmy one of the strange savage little
people who drifted like ghosts through the
jungle a people ruthless in war feared
and respected for their bravery and cun-
ning

  muscles rippled smoothly in his arms and
shoulders as the little man bent to drink
there was a regal grace in his movements
hidden power in his taut hard body the
careless manner in which he held his blow
gun showed he did not suspect the pres-
ence of the hidden men

 the pygmy crouched long by the
stream slowly drinking the cool water
directly across from him pressed deep in
the soft mud were the two immense foot-
prints they were prints to excite any
native especially an ever-curious pygmy
the small man rose however trotted
through the water and passed the unusual
spoor without so much as a glance

  when the slight figure disappeared the
white man stood up slapping the stinging
gnats away from his face and hands the
black rose too expelled his breath with
a sigh

  it is good we did not slay him he
told his master i recognize the small
one he is ngeeso chief of the pygmies
his men would comb the forest to find
his killers

  the doctor made no reply for just such
reason he had forbidden an arrow from
the monsters of voo doo isle

ambush he stared at the monster tracks
squashed deep in the mud

  odd he said half to himself he ran
right by the tracks without noticing them
then he shrugged his shoulders as though it
were of no consequence and plunged for-
ward his long legs endeavoring to make up
the time lost

  his hard-faced companion did not dis-
miss so easily the memory of the pygmy
chieftains action but he kept his thoughts
to himself knowing they would anger his
master experience had taught him an
immense respect for the pygmies he knew
it was second nature for the keen-eyed
ngeeso to read every sign on the trail
the fact that the little man gave no atten-
tion to the giant tracks only proved he was
already familiar with them and with the
means of their origin

  and a secret in the hands of a pygmy
was no longer a secret yet the black man
held his tongue perhaps they could finish
their mission and get away before ngeeso
could act in any case he dared not give
any additional bad news to the doctor

  shortly they came to a fallen tree the
long-dead trunk half blocked the trail and
its position and the freshly torn turf about
it told the story some creature of immense
power had lifted the rotting trunk from
the underbrush and tossed it into the trail
the soft damp wood on the underside
was scratched and ripped where huge fin-
gers had searched for grubs

  see he begins to search for food the
doctor exclaimed his hunger will trap
him for us

  the two men pushed forward at a faster
gait their quarry was only a few minutes
ahead the white mans bow was tightly
set his unblinking eyes fierce and deter-
mined the native loosened the small pack
he carried shrugged it from his shoulders
carried it ready in his hand

  the jungle was abruptly silent it was
the strained ominous quiet that falls when
fear grasps the forests teaming small life
then ahead sounded the rending split of
wood a branch had been sheared from a
tree and the noise resounded like a blast

  the doctor broke into a run now even
his untrained ears caught the crackle of
trampled shrubs the snap of branches
forced aside by a ponderous slow moving
body perspiration streamed down the
white mans tense face

ki-gor and helene

  a green sweep of vines a hundred feet
further on shivered and ripped apart a
giant figure burst through the wire-strong
tangle stood clearly revealed in the trail
he was huge as a massive stone idol

  his hairy body was hideous in its size
rearing more than twice as tall as a man
with a gross and monstrous breadth he
stepped forward balancing on awkward
over-size feet his long arms dangling to
his knees

  atop the mountain of flesh the creatures
bulbous misshapen head sat grotesquely
there was a formlessness about his fea-
tures as though the face were wax that
had partially melted the poorly mated
eyes moved slowly taking overly long to
focus on objects through some deformity
of the neck muscles the creatures head
sagged always to the left and forward

  the beast swayed dully in the trail
his sluggish mind struggled to decide on
his next move in his posture his hairi-
body his long arms was a kinship with
the great apes yet no ape who shattered
the congo morning with a fearsome chal-
lenge could stand in combat before this
monster for long

  quick quick the pack the white
mans command came

the native placed the bundle in his
masters outstretched hand then stood
away as the white man advanced more
slowly opening the pack as he neared the
	jungle

beast he showed no fear made no move
for the gun looped over his shoulder

  moldar he called his voice cracking
like a pistol shot

  the giant swung to face him the dull
eyes focused slowly the vast sluggish
body swayed indecisively then as mighty
muscles tensed it appeared the creature
would lunge to the attack

  the white man sensed the threat he
halted but continued to talk he was small
and insignificant before the towering black
bulk

  quiet moldar he ordered heres
food from the pack he drew an aromatic
loaf it was a mixture of foods pressed
together

  catch he said and tossed the loaf at
the beast

  at the word catch the creatures arm
snapped out with surprising speed snared
the loaf in mid-air he crammed the loaf
into his mouth devouring it with a gulp
then he waved an arm forward again
growls rumbling from his deep chest

  the white man held out another loaf
and walking slowly away from the giant
called him to follow the creature refused
to budge his only reaction was the
increased violence of his snarls

  the doctors voice grew sharper he
threw another loaf then tried again to
lead the beast away this time the monster
stopped his rumbling listened attentively
to the command voice

  the doctor retreated further down the
trail holding the loaf invitingly in view
the beast swayed forward began to follow
with ponderous steps the tight muscles
in the doctors face relaxed he fell into a
normal walk the native reappeared smil-
ing at his masters triumph the heavy
tread of the following giant slowed then
stopped the white man swung around to
face the creature this time he was relaxed
confident

  moldar he called

  he knew the beast would follow him
now

ii

kx-gor white lord of the jungle
raced down the narrow game trail
with effortless grace despite his ground-
eating pace his great body moved with

stories

velvet ease he was a tall superbly pro-
portioned man with a deeply tanned hard-
muscled body that tapered from broad
shoulders to slim hips

  like a figure from pagan mythology
he glided through the tumbled wilderness
of tropical vegetation his muscle-corded
body was naked but for a leopard-skin
breachclout at his waist was a long ivory
handled knife the quiver on his back was
filled with arrows and in his right hand
he carried a powerful bow

  ki-gor moved through the jungle not as
a white hunter or even a native he stalked
the dim trails as a creature of the wild
an equal in stealth and cunning of the
wariest forest denizen

  he paused now relishing the pleasure
of the hunt he gave his head a quick toss
throwing his blond mane into place
though he stalked only a springbok he
took the keenest enjoyment in matching
his skill against the fleet wily animal his
keen ears caught no hint of the springboks
nearness but his sensitive nostrils searched
out the creatures scent

  ki-gor veered from the trail slid
wraithlike through the seemingly impene-
trable mesh of fern and vine his cautious
tread was further cushioned by the thick
damp carpet of rotting leaves

  the white lord shifted the bow to his
left hand fitted an arrow to it with prac-
ticed skill except for the quick shift of
his blue eyes he was relaxed the spring-
boks warm fresh scent grew stronger as
he worked his way upwind toward his
quarry

  a lane opened between the trees the
gazelle grazed daintily at the far end ki-
gor raised his bow in a smooth swift ges-
ture the springbok caught the movement
from complete repose the animal exploded
into action leaped with all its amazing
power toward a dense stand of kunai grass
its soaring bound came incredibly fast

  but ki-gors reactions outraced his
quarrys suddenly taut muscles knotted
and curled on his brawny arms and shoul-
ders the great bow too powerful for an
average man to draw bent like a reed under
ki-gors quick power

  too fast to follow the long arrow sped
toward the leaping springbok the missile
struck with the abrupt flat sound of a
slapping palm the creature convulsed in
the monsters of voo doo isle	

its arcing flight and writhing disappeared
into the thick kunai grass there was a
brief surging rustle then silence

  ki-gor trotted into the grass a few
yards and surveyed his kill with jungle
caution he listened a moment made cer-
tain of his own safety before kneeling
beside his quarry then he drew his knife
and with deft strokes severed a few choice
cuts he wrapped the meat in a broad
cool leaf tied it with a vine so that he
carried it slung beside his quiver

  his mission completed ki - gors
thoughts turned immediately to his golden
mate helene waiting for his return at
silver river though he had been away
from her only a few brief hours he felt an
overwhelming longing to see her to hear
her soft laughing voice

  as a man of action brought up in a
savage primitive world ki-gor was little
given to introspection he seldom consid-
ered the drastic change in his existence in
his very being that had taken place since
the red-haired american girl had literally
crashed into his life he rarely thought
beyond that day when helenes airplane
developed engine trouble on a trans-conti-
nental hop and made a forced landing in
the jungle

  ki-gor started back along the trail but
soon grew impatient at the slow pace of
ground travel securing his bow he caught
a length of liana and with a powerful
thrust of his lithe body swung to a low
hanging bough he ran along the branch
catapulted upward to reach the middle
branches and began to move eastward to-
ward the clearing and helene

  ki-gor drove in an almost straight line
for awhile then adjusted his course to more
or less parallel the main trail that led
toward the river his watchful eye soon
caught sight of a sturdy little figure
leisurely trotting in the same direction the
white lord followed ki-gor studied the
jogging man intently a few moments then
recognizing his small friend ngeeso he
smiled with pleasure he started to swing
down to the trail overtake the pygmy chief
but a better idea struck him broadened his
smile

  the white lord was unable to resist
a joke at ngeesos expense obviously
the little chief headed for ki-gors camp
it would startle and puzzle him if when

he arrived a third plate of food awaited
him the pygmy would not rest until he
learned how ki-gor came to expect him

  chuckling to himself ki-gor began
framing outlandish tales of magical powers
with which to harass ngeeso the white
lord swung in a wide arc around the trot-
ting native to escape discovery then he
began to race along the tree routes with
dizzy speed

twice as he neared the camp ki-gor
gave a distinctive thrilling whistle to
warn helene of his coming the sound
came back like a soft musical echo as his
mate replied the red-haired girl stood
waiting in the clearing as ki-gor plunged
from the trees landed before her

  she was a fitting mate to the white lord
of the jungle spotlighted by a column
of sunlight she was breath-takingly beau-
tiful as she waited the sun struck glints
of fire from her long hair high-lighted
every curve of her golden body she
frowned quizzically but laughter was in
her blue eyes

  helene knew ki-gor well knew his
hurtling entrance meant some prank was
in the offing

  now what trick are you up to ki-
gor she asked pursing her lips in
mock severity

  ho woman is that a way to greet a
great hunter who brings you food ki-
gor said in the lordly manner of a native
chief addressing one of many wives

  the bronzed giant  glanced critically
around the clearing as he took the bundle
of meat from his back his eyes halted on
the almost dead fire

  why is my meal not prepared he
asked loudly so you spend the day play-
ing with that worthless monkey boko
instead of working i should sell you both
to the arabs

  at the mention of his name helenes pet
monkey came scrambling across the clear-
ing he stopped beside his mistress turned
his old mans face admiringly toward her

  youre a worse monkey than boko
declared helene in the first place i had
nothing to cook until my husband could
find some old blind creature he was able
to kill second you never will eat this
early

  so then must i cook my own food


jungle stories

ki-gor sped past helene moving like one
possessed he grabbed up an armful of fire
wood blew the fire into quick life he
sliced generous portions of meat put them
to cooking the clearing was on the bank
of silver river and ki-gor raced up the
bank to the first waterfall above the camp
he darted along a narrow shelf of rock that
led behind the waterfall behind the fall
was a small cave which provided an ideal
natural ice box ki-gor emerged from
this storehouse carrying fish a variety of
fruits yams bananas and nuts

  he had the meal under way in surpris-
ingly short time only then did he venture
to answer the stream of questions with
which helene pestered him pleased at
his success in teasing her he caught his
lithe mate up in his arms carried her to
their customary eating place

 he recounted how he discovered
ngeeso and explained his plan to empha-
size how utterly without surprise was the
pygmys surprise visit ki-gor wanted to
worry his impish friend by claiming he
knew through some myterious means the
pygmys every move

  helene entered into the prank whole-
heartedly she placed three sets of gourd
dishes on fresh green leaves meanwhile
ki-gor heaped a large platter with food
set it in the center of the dining place then
helene and he sat waiting

  they knew from experience ngeeso
would suddenly materialize at the edge of
the clearing shout a loud greeting and
wait for their startled reaction

  he appeared as they knew he would
the bantam warrior silent as a shadow
slid from the jungle behind ki-gors back
he shattered the air with the traditional
greeting ho i come without weapons
ho a friend comes 

  neither helene nor ki-gor moved a
muscle in a lazy drawling voice ki-gor
called over his shoulder you grow old
friend ngeeso to travel so slowly come
before your meal is cold

  ngeesos mouth dropped open his
face betrayed how well the tables were
turned how confounded he was he rushed
forward stared at the place set for him
at favorite foods obviously prepared for
him alone his shrewd eyes searched ki-
gors pleasant but unrevealing face
helene further deflated him it is good

to see you ngeeso i was pleased three
days ago when ki-gor said you were com-
ing

the little man collapsed heavily into
jl his eating place he scratched one leg
aimlessly

  it cannot be he said huskily why
he protested i did not even know myself
three days ago he stared at the food
peered once more into ki-gors face
when at last he spoke his voice was low

  so the great ki-gor the one who so
long has smiled at the witchdoctors now
takes up their practices himself only a
witchdoctor could know i was coming
could know the exact time

  ki-gor devoted his attention to heap-
ing the pygmys plate with food helene
insisted on individual plates and though
at first ki-gor thought it foolish he had
grown to like the custom ngeeso ate
slowly advancing solution after solution
as to how ki-gor knew of his visit return-
ing always the answer that it was witch-
craft

  at last the white lord could restrain
himself no longer he burst out with a
booming laugh explained the whole mat-
ter to the little chief ngeeso was relieved
immediately and helping his plate again
began to recover his spirits casting about
for a way to reestablish his prestige he
remembered the real reason for his visit

  it is a good trick ngeeso declared
we can use it again soon he smiled hap-
pily as he imparted the next news my
men discovered masai warriors approach-
ing five suns ago they watch them every
hour of the day and night our friend
tembu george leads them here

  ki-gors gray eyes twinkled at the
obvious delight which the pygmy took in
bedeviling his great friend and rival for
ki-gors affections tembu george mighty
chieftain of the masai

  ngeesos purpose in having his men
follow tembu georges progress was
clear it appealed to ngeesos sense of
humor to make the masai warriors seem
like inept clumsy woodsmen ngeeso at
every possible opportunity told tembu
george he crashed through the jungle like
an old blind elephant since every warrior
prided himself on his jungle craft by
checking on tembu georges every move
the monsters of voo boo isle

 ki-gor threw all his power into the desperate lunge

and by informing ki-gor of his approach
the pygmy could have a marvelous time
in belittling the masais skill

  ngeeso and tembu george were ki-
gors staunchest friends amy one of the
trio would make any possible sacrifice for
another together they would face any
danger and their past exploits already
were jungle legend but the giant masai
and the pygmy chieftain to hear them talk
were deadly scornful rivals

  tembu george will be so ashamed when
we finish with him he wont be able to
lift his head rejoiced the pygmy

  what makes you think he doesnt know
about your men put in helene know-
ing tembu george he is probably waiting

for the proper time to capture them all
it would please him to bring them here
tied up on poles like wild pigs

  ngeeso sobered knowing the masai
chief was fully capable of just such villainy
but he had detailed his best warriors to
watch the masai he relaxed assuring him-
self it was not likely his men would be
taken unawares

  i suppose tembu george will want us
to hunt with him the pygmy suggested
innocently

  he likes to hunt ki-gor said

  for a minute ngeeso pursued the sub-
ject no further he watched helene play-
ing with boko the flame-haired girl was
teaching the monkey to bring her articles
	jungle

she would show boko a stick or a piece
of fruit then toss it a few yards away
coax him to bring it to her monkey-like
bokos interest in the game always waned
quickly but for a time he would obediently
fetch the thrown article at helenes com-
mand bring it here

  what will you hunt asked ngeeso
abruptly resuming his favorite subject of
tembu george

  two lions are killing men near lake
cama said ki-gor we will hunt them
ho grunted ngeeso the man-
eaters are sport enough for an ordinary
hunter like tembu george but i know
where there is greater game

  the little man glanced sidewise his keen
eyes judging the jungle lords interest
in his voice was an excitement he could
not subdue

  i know a trail that only the brave can
follow only those who walk without fear
kill with the lightnings swiftness the man
who makes this kill will be known through-
out the jungle

ki-gor grunted to show he was listen-
ing threw a twig at boko what
weird tale was the little man concocting
now to make the hunt with tembu george
seem a pale affair

  i am a great hunter ngeeso pro-
claimed my men urged that i make the
kill alone but i thought of my friend ki-
gor i wanted to share my good fortune
with him

  all the jungle praises your generosity
said ki-gor but only helene caught the
wry humor in his tone

  this one is a giant many times taller
than you and with shoulders broader than
a man can jump ngeeso declared his
voice growing excited aaaiiieee he is
hairy like an ape but his step shatters
the earth and all the evil of the night is in
his voice

  ki-gor noted the flame that kindled in
the pygmys eyes ngeesos face was
deadly serious had ngeeso seen some-
thing unusual or was this another native
rumor grown even larger in the retelling 

  tembu george will be pleased to share
such a hunt with us ki-gor said

  ngeesos expressive hands made a dep-
recating gesture then the wily pygmy
caught himself remembered to use guile

stories

  we cannot wait he said flatly we
must hunt at once or the chance will be
gone at ki-gors questioning glance he
continued a strange white hunter fol-
lows the trail

  what  ki-gor was abruptly interested
he knew of no white man in this area
you saw this man

  i saw his spoor on the trail replied
ngeeso he tracks the giant

  then we will go at once the white
lord decided

  but his reason for going was not what
the delighted ngeeso believed he still
placed little faith in the tale of a giant
ape but if a white man had entered his
territory he must have a look at him with
renegade whites always came trouble no
white man other than ki-gor was sup-
posed to be within hundreds of miles of
this dense little-known congo spot

  ki-gor rose stood towering above the
pygmy a far-away look in his eyes it was
puzzling that a stranger requiring guides
and the help of native tribes could travel
the congo without the jungle telegraph
betraying his presence yet not once had
the throbbing drums mentioned an intruder

  when ki-gors decision was made
helene was instantly ready to go she
quickly brought him his weapons boko
although uninvited made it clear he in-
tended to follow his mistress

  looking on the trip as only a small
adventure ki-gor and helene were gay
and happy as they left the clearing ngeeso
trotted behind the jungle couple and lis-
tening to their carefree talk his own elation
drained away his face grew solemn a
pang of fear of regret darted through him

  the white lords skill was the greatest
in the jungle and his bravery was unques-
tioned yet fresh in ngeesos memory was
the hulking monster that smashed trees
aside like shrubs he alone was responsi-
ble for leading ki-gor on this dangerous
mission and suddenly ngeeso was
afraid for his great friend

ill

ngeeso trailed the jungle couple in
silence for a long while he was
bewildered by the sudden doubts which
assailed him time and again he started to
call to the white lord urge him to turn
the monsters of voo doo isle



back he was utterly devoted to ki-gor
and helene and he could not bear to think
he might cause them harm

  but when he thought of the devil beast
he could not turn back in the jungle a
great hunter was respected above all if
he could share in killing this monster
ngeesos name would be spoken with
respect in the furthest corner of the congo
this was the chance of a lifetime and the
little man could not let it pass

he watched the white lords easy
stride heard his carefree voice ki-
gors every move revealed the immense
strength and vitality that throbbed in his
muscled body the smooth play of his
long hard muscles held ngeesos eye

  the pygmy chief was suddenly reas-
sured the white lord of the jungle was
not a man like other men the gray-eyed
steel-nerved jungle man was a figure to
command respect and confidence

  ngeeso smiled he was an old woman
to doubt the powers of the mighty ki-gor
he was a fool to worry that his friend
could not outwit the huge but stupid beast

  as his bouyant spirits returned he sav-
ored the thought of tembu georges arri-
val he planned how he would carefully
refer to hunting down the monster thereby
squelching completely the tales of prowess
the masai leader intended to relate

  though ki-gor lay little faith in
ngeesos story of a strange monster he
took increasing note of the little mans cer-
tainty of action ngeeso took the lead
when they left the neighborhood of ki-
gors camp without wasted motion the
pygmy hurried them along a network of
paths toward the creatures haunts ki-
gor expected at most to find some unu-
sually vicious or hunger-maddened animal
ngeesos movements grew more stealthy
as they progressed he was cool as always
on a hunt but ki-gor from long expe-
rience knew the pygmy was unusually
cautious

  then ngeeso motioned them to a halt
he pursed his lips gave a liquid warbling
bird call helene took advantage of the
pause to rest her pet monkey moved play-
fully through the branches overhead

  ki-gor was intrigued by ngeesos
action but he asked no questions the
white lord lounged against a tree his

interest apparently focused on the erratic
progress of a small bright-green frog he
heard the almost imperceptible rustle
which followed ngeesos signal and
abruptly realized how carefully the small
chief had planned this foray

  two bands of pygmies slid from the
underbrush they said nothing but their
broad grins adequately expressed their
pleasure at ki-gors presence ngeeso
glanced innocently at the white lord the
warriors presence showed how confident
the sly little chief had been that he could
lure the jungle man to the hunt ki-gor
smiled inwardly yet he realized if ngeeso
with such an able force of hunters still
came to him for aid then the quarry must
be dangerous indeed

  he frowned turned his gray eyes on
helene as though reading his mind she
tossed her head emphatically declared i
will not do it ki-gor i am going with you
and i will not stay back here you know
there cant be any such monster so dont
be worrying about me

  wah ki-gor said in mock fear i
will match you against ngeesos devil-
beast any day

  the white lords moment of doubt
passed  he little man was merely plotting
to draw him into a hunt before tembu
georges arrival it was only a move to
take the edge off tembu georges visit

  the party moved forward again boko
like the pet he was swung back and forth
through the trees above them he was
enjoying the outing as much as a city dog
taken on a walk through the park

  an increasingly strong gorilla scent
assailed ki-gors nostrils the harsh male
scent freshened as they went single file
down the trail ngeeso was in the lead
with ki-gor second helene next and then
the pygmy warriors strung out behind
brilliant plumaged birds shrieked their
protests at bokos antics

   he is just ahead ngeeso whispered
then we hunt one of the tree people
asked ki-gor employing the native name
for gorilla

   aaaiiieee ki-gor my words are truth
this is a devil-beast such as you have never
seen believe me though his scent is that
of the tree folk he is a dreadful giant of
evil

   at this point boko bored by his com-
	jungle

panions slow ground travel frisked far
ahead out of sight emboldened by the
presence of his friends the man-things
boko ranged with reckless abandon but
shortly after he disappeared boko shrieked
piercingly his voice almost human in its
terror he came hurtling back threw him-
self into helenes arms shaking with
fright

  helene attempted to quiet boko but as
they followed ngeeso in the direction from
which the monkey had fled the little fel-
lows terror increased finally he could
stand it no longer and tearing himself from
helenes arms he sped back down the trail

k-gor was puzzled by the pets action
realizing no ordinary jungle sight
could so frighten boko urged by inner
instinct the white lord tested his bow
held it ready now the gorilla scent was
everywhere he felt the short hairs along
the back of his neck bristle felt his muscles
tense yet his mind still found no explana-
tion for these instinctive reactions

  the trail opened into a sunlit clearing
waist-high kunai grass rippled in the faint
wind silence pressed over the clearing
no sign of life stirred on the open land
not a single bird call broke the eerie quiet
even the staccato calls of the tree toads
were hushed yet beneath this apparent
peace was the electric feel of danger

  though no word was spoken the pyg-
mies paused at the edge of the clearing
for the first time in his memory ki-gor
noted apprehension among the bold little
hunters this was the devil-beasts lair
and somewhere in the still forest about the
clearing lurked the monster

  then the thing they waited for came
terrible earth -shaking the creatures
shattering challenge sounded the faint
breeze eddying over the kunai grass had
carried their scent to him the blasting
noise was an angry rolling crash of thun-
der timber snapped and broke under the
impact of tremendous weight

  the great beast moved to meet them
the hunted came to face its hunters this
was no frightened quarry fearful of man
and his weapons

  ki-gor stared across at the line of trees
he saw a stand of saplings shiver then
sway back before an immense weight a
mammoth creature smashed his way from

stories

the forest stood clearly revealed in the
sunlit clearing-

  an involuntary scream broke from
helenes lips after a first gasp of alarm
the pygmies froze in their tracks even
ki-gor stared at the gargantuan creature
in disbelief unable to trust his own eyes
the monster stood upright drummed on
his vast chest with mounting fury he
showed many gorilla characteristics both
in looks and actions but in his tremendous
stature his vast breadth of chest there
was something unnatural misshapen

  never had ki-gor seen such dreadful
fury as the beast exhibited a burning
madness possessed him studying the
beast ki-gors keen eyes discovered an
answer embedded deep in the monsters
shoulder were two arrows the blood still
ebbed from the raw torn flesh no wonder
the creature raged at the sight of men he
knew by bitter experience men were his
enemies and in his raging strength he
thirsted for vengeance

  the monster screamed his hate to the
heavens he drummed his chest ripped and
tore at the underbrush then with a
landslides fearful irresistible momentum
he lunged to the attack the earth shook
under the blasting drive of his feet it was
incredible so huge and awkward a creature
could move so fast a moan went up from
the pygmies and except for ngeeso they
were paralyzed ki-gor watched the rac-
ing monster knew in that moment poisoned
darts could never halt that bulk of bone
and muscle in time there was just cause
for the pygmies despair for they also
had realized the truth too late

  the white lord of the jungle recognized
in that instant the lives of all of them
depended on his actions he alone could
stop the insane killer and yet the fester-
ing arrows buried in the beasts shoulder
showed how puny even were his weapons

  but not without reason was the white
lords name a legend in the jungle ki-gor
stood without a tremor as death raced
toward him steel-nerved he swept an
arrow from his quiver fitted it to his
great bow he aimed as coolly and delib-
erately as a machine which knows no
feeling

  the muscles of his back and arms
writhed like snakes as he drew the bow
then the long arrow flashed in the sun-
the monsters of voo doo isle	

light hissed as it cleft the air in hurtling
flight it struck true to its mark pain
and hurt were abruptly in the monsters
maddened screams

the ponderous beast slowed swerved
sideways he raised one hand to claw at
his face tear at the arrow which lay
embedded in his eye socket ngeeso
stabbed three poisoned darts into the hairy
bulk a pygmy believing ki - gor had
permanently halted the beast had dealt
a fatal wound gave an exultant shriek

  but the mountainous creature was far
from death his vast network of bone and
muscle would not die easily the pygmys
cry made him swing his good eye on the
group his slow mind linked the tearing
pain in his head with the humans he
roared his hate heaved forward to rip
the man-things to bits

  with the beast almost upon them this
time the pygmies broke and ran only
ngeeso held firm stabbing poisoned darts
into the thick hide and the white lord
of the jungle stood unwavering never
moving his gaze from the beasts good eye
as the monster thundered down on him
he drew his bowstring back to the furthest
point its sharp clear twang went un-
heard as the jungles deadliest marksman
drove his second arrow into the devil-
beasts remaining eye

  ki-gor had achieved his purpose he
had blinded the giant he watched the
mountainous creature reel blindly drunk-
enly off course crashing into the wall of
trees to his right

  the mammoth animal flailed and clawed
the matted underbrush destroying every-
thing that came in reach even blinded
he was still terrible in his power

  ki-gor had judged the giant well he
knew the best placed arrows could not
bring sudden death to the devil - beast
realizing he could not stop the charge he
took the only course open he made the
giant helpless by blinding him

  darts darts ki-gor commanded
his stern voice jerking the pygmy warriors
back to their senses the little men ranged
themselves about the ravening animal
their poisoned barbs pelted into his tough
skin his mad exertions his fruitless rushes
served to pump the poison rapidly through
his body the pygmies danced back and

forth eluding the giants ever-more sluggish
rushes then with almost stunning abrupt-
ness the monster staggered and fell
quickly he was dead

  a triumphant cry went up from the pyg-
mies ngeeso was beside himself with
joy he leaped about in happiness but
ki-gor showed little elation turning in-
stead to reassure himself that helene was
all right she stood wide-eyed and solemn
regarding the miraculous deed her great
mate had wrought

  i thought it was the end she con-
fessed where could that-that thing
have come from

  wah ki-gor exclaimed truly it is
a puzzle he frowned thinking of the
beasts destructive power there is work
for ngeeso tembu george and me we
must learn more about this mad one we
must search out his story

  they walked nearer the huge carcass
ki-gors careful eyes studied the body it
was the figure of a gorilla but strangely
huge

  maybe hes a freak suggested helene
something is so unnatural so distorted
about him

  ngeeso and his men however were
little concerned with the devil-beasts origin
they were drunk with delight at having
shared in such a kill they wrangled
excitedly about the best method to take
the skin for they were laying plans even
now to parade this trophy through a score
of villages

  aamiieee cried ngeeso reaching high
to tap ki-gor on the chest will not
tembu georges eyes pop when he sees
this never again will he dare raise his
voice to boast of his puny hunts ngeeso
chortled in glee and those foolish masai
warriors will see what it means to have a
chief who can lead his men to a real kill
ki-gor nodded his head sagely agreeing
with every word then he pointed to the
wound in the creatures shoulder the
feathered tips of two arrows protruded from
the flesh even under their crust of dried
blood the distinctive mark of the arrows
were clearly discernible those tribal
markings were known to every native

  the masai wont be too surprised when
you tell them your story ki-gor softly
pointed out those arrows show they have
already seen him
	jungle

  ngeesos face fell he was speechless
for a moment thunderstruck to think his
carefully laid plan had been smashed by
tembu georges meddling warriors then
as he began to think clearly he brightened
again

  ho it is so much better he stated
where they failed i have succeeded

  his buoyant spirits once more soaring
the pygmy chief turned away to loudly
direct the devil-beasts skinning helene
and ki-gor exchanged mirthful glances
but they said nothing it was ngeesos
hour of victory and amused by the little
mans anxiety to outdo his rival the jungle
couple made no mention of the chief actors
part in the kill

but though ki-gor smiled the puzzle
of the giant beast bore on his mind
he was anxious to learn more about the
creature learn how it came here where it
came from so much did the subject absorb
him that he let drop his original aim to
investigate the white hunters presence he
decided to return to silver river and
immediately upon tembu georges arrival
set out with the masai chieftain to back-
track the devil-beast

  back at their camp the next day the
jungle couple directed preparations for
tembu georges visit the pygmy hunters
helped lay in a stock of game and fruits
alone of all the pygmies ngeeso was of
little help yet he was most anxious of
all for tembu george to arrive the
pygmy chief squatted by the fire rocked
happily on his heels embroidered over and
over to himself an ever more detailed tale
of the devil-beast with which to amaze the
masai leader

  nightfall came without any sign of the
masai in the morning feeling certain the
big fighting men must arrive soon every-
one was astir at dawn as the hours passed
uneventfully the camp grew more watch-
ful

  it was mid-morning when ki - gor
abruptly straightened stood listening all
eyes focused on his intent face one man
comes the white lord said at length

  tembu george runs ahead suggested
helene

  it is so ngeeso quickly agreed

  but ki-gor said nothing he listened
to the almost inaudible sound made by the

stories

running man it was not like tembu george
to outdistance his men and ki-gor knew
this then minutes later a tall muscled
masai warrior raced into view his body
glistened with sweat his breath came in
the heavy uneven gasps of a man who has
overtaxed his strength but though the
masai was obviously exhausted he held
himself proudly stiffly erect

  the warrior paid no attention to the
cry of welcome which greeted him he
brushed through the line of pygmies that
moved to meet him went straight to ki-
gor his face was strangely wooden he
stood silently for seconds staring at ki-
gor his tired mind groping for words

  ki-gor sensed something was wrong
badly wrong speak bagodu the white
lord said swiftly what is it concern
was in his face as he reached a friendly
hand to the warriors shoulder

  words came to the warrior then he
spoke in a voice harsh with sorrow and
fatigue spoke through lips which twisted
with the pain of what he must say

  the masai need you o ki-gor tembu
george lies dying

iv

the clearing was suddenly so still the
winds faint whisper in the upper trees
was clearly heard the pygmies fell to
shocked silence helene looked unbeliev-
ingly at bagodu for a moment then her
face paled and she caught her breath

  the white lord of the jungle did not
move did not speak for a timeless interval
his face froze in hard set lines of self-
control then cold and quick his voice
leaped out

  tembu georges killers will not live to
gloat he promised grimly concluding the
masai chieftain was fatally wounded by
some jungle renegade band who did this
thing 

  no ki-gorit was a hunting accident
bagodu said we found him unconscious
cut and bruised as though he had fought an
animal with his hands he was hurt but
with a little care we thought he would
easily recover

  the huge masai paused hardly able to
speak of the matter tembu george was
adored by his warriors and bagodu was
stunned by the swift turn of events
the monsters of voo doo isle



  the wasuli village was near he con-
tinued we took tembu george there
and the wasuli king gave us every help
but tembu george immediately grew
worse helplessly the warrior concluded
he is dying and we can do nothing his
skin is like fire and his muscles hardened
into steel knots

  ngeeso had pushed his way to ki-gors
side he stood frowning his eyes soft
with sorrow when he spoke he spoke
as if tembu george already were dead

  it is the fever of the black water he
said quietly the very ground of the
wasuli area is sick with it if his muscles
knot hard and his body sweat then it is
the fever not his wounds

  bagodu nodded in despair kalida the
new wasuli king said it was the sickness
ki-gor had heard tales of the strange
sickness of the swift deadliness with which
it acted many wasuli had died with it
in the last few moons even friendly peace-
loving old king nhya-nyag was struck
down with the fever the new king
kalido was the former rulers cousin

  i go at once ki-gor told bagodu
he must not die

  ki-gor glanced at helene knowing the
pain in his heart she said nothing but
when he trotted from the clearing she ran
at his side tembu george was also her
friend and unnoticed in the confusion
boko helenes pet scampered to follow his
mistress

  we follow cried ngeeso as the
jungle couple swung into the tree routes
sped toward the east

  ki-gors mind was in turmoil a world
as bright an hour before was suddenly
darkened tembu georges loss would
leave a void in ki-gors life in addi-
tion the mighty masai chieftain was an
influence for good in the jungle second
only to ki-gor with his steadying influ-
ence gone a score of old feuds might well
revive

  the war-like masai once the scourge
of the congo now worked with ki-gor to
maintain peace avoid senseless bloodshed
with tembu george dead a weaker less
dominant leader might be unable to hold
in check africas most dreaded warriors

  and the method in which tembu george
was injured puzzled ki-gor it was unlike
the skilled warrior to be taken unawares

by man or beast while such thoughts
turned endlessly in his mind the white
lord and his mate sped through the green
twilight of the trees

  neither the great-muscled white lord
nor his slim lithe mate spoke as they
drove tirelessly toward the wasuli vil-
lage there was none of the usual joy in
their graceful swinging flight the ex-
change of playful jibes the leisurely side-
explorations were forgotten this was a
grimly serious race with death ki-gor
was ever urged to greater speed by the
thought he might help save tembu george
if he could arrive in time

entering the wasuli hunting
grounds he wondered at the signal
drums silence it was odd that the jungle
telegraph lay unused ordinarily the
great drum would be spelling out tembu
georges progress and the message would
be picked up by distant villages to be
relayed in an ever-widening circle through
the congo the masai chieftains fate
was a matter of deep interest to countless
tribes whether friendly or enemy peoples

  then when the wasuli were so close he
could smell the smoke of their campfires
the great drum spoke it spoke with the
clear swift breaks that an accomplished
drummer sending a vital message imparts
heavy and ominous the drum beat sounded

  ki-gor slowed and stopped as the great
drums notes smote the air he listened
and his face was graven stone he
listened and his broad shoulders sagged
his long steel-fingered hands knotted into
fists

  helene could not read the drum talk
but this once she did not need to under-
stand the rapid beat she looked at her
silent motionless mate and understood
boko came near her chattered curiously at
her stillness but she gave him no notice

  tembu george was dead

  the giant black man with his quick
smile and his deep joyful voice was gone
the huge warrior who would have led his
men against the devils own legions at
ki-gors bidding was no more the tall
straight american negro who had won
leadership of the masai through his wis-
dom and strength of arms never again
would cry out a happy greeting to ki-gor
and helene
	jungle

  minutes passed before ki-gor stirred
again then with careful deliberate move-
ments he descended to the ground when
helene joined him he led her toward the
village boko upset by the strange actions
of his masters followed disconsolately

  the death drum still maintained its
rhythmic beat when they entered the vil-
lage ki-gor halted at the entrance stared
at the unfamiliar cluster of huts he sel-
dom visited the wasuli their record was
not one to inspire the white lords trust
or friendship they were lazy treacherous
people forever in search of easy spoils

  king nhya - nyag whose reign had
lasted only three years had kept the wasuli
in bounds and was beginning to gain the
good - will of neighboring tribes when he
suddenly died of the fever kigor was
not acquainted with kalido the new ruler
who had assumed the throne two moons
before

  men and women stood about in small
groups there was an air of uneasiness in
the village in each persons mind was the
thought that perhaps he might be the next
victim then too it was not good that
a masai chieftain should die in their vil-
lage

  in some unaccountable way the fierce
masai might attach tembu georges death
to them the wasuli warriors and women
alike wished above all else not to antag-
onize the masai fighting men ki-gor
sensed this tension knew its origin

  suddenly a keen-eyed woman saw ki-
gor and his red-haired mate the low-
voiced murmur of conversation fell away
all eyes focused on ki-gor how would
the white lord of the jungle take his
friends death

  then a heavy-shouldered powerfully-
built man well above average height strode
through the silent natives his carriage
his step easily identified him as a strong
man both in body and mind he raised
his right hand as he approached the jungle
couple his bright quick eyes never
wavered from the white lords face

  i greet you in sorrow oh ki-gor the
big man said in deep even tones excuse
the rude silence of my people they are
embarrassed that your visit is an occasion
of sadness

  so this was kalido even in this mo-
ment ki-gor could not help comparing

stories

the assured speech the confident manner
of this man with his predecessors
shambling uncertain actions

  though the time of our first meeting
is bad the fault is not yours you have
my thanks kalido for helping my friend
ki-gor paused his eyes searching for a
sign of the masai now-if you will show
me where my friend lies

  kalido regarded the white lord a mo-
ment longer then with slow measured
step led the way in the center of the
village ki-gor saw the tall masai stand-
ing stiffly about a hut their stone faces
revealed nothing but their eyes mirrored
their anguish

  ogaahni scarred by many battles stood
at the door of the hut in the war-like
masai order the command now passed to
him helene and kalido stood back as
ki-gor approached the chieftain

  ki-gors arm went to the straight-backed
warriors shoulder the drums say a
friend is gone the white lord said
simply my heart says the sun is gone
it is so oh ki-gor ogaahni replied
hoarsely it is good you are here we
are lost

  i would sit with my friend ki-gor
said indicating his desire to be alone with
tembu george

  ogaahni hesitated his tongue could not
find the words to deny ki-gor but kalido
was quickly at ki-gors side

  ogaahni has not the heart to bar you
the wasuli king said in a low serious
voice but it is dangerous the fever
stays long with the body i beg you not
to endanger your own life tembu george
would understand

  the white lords jaw set hard i would
be less than a man to let fear hold me
out

ogaahnis hard face softened at the
white lords declaration it was not
good to keep a mans friends from his side
at such a time native custom required it
even though kalido warned of the great
danger seeing his words had no effect
kalido glanced at helene but found no
support there he nodded in understand-
ing stepped back

  ogaahni pulled aside the rush netting
which closed the doorway bending low
to clear the sill the jungle lord stepped
the monsters of voo doo isle



into the huts dim interior helene took
a quick breath followed him the netting
closed behind them   

  later the masai asked ki-gor to council
with them they sought his advice as to
tembu georges burial in the jungle
burial rites must be held quickly

  realizing it was impossible to return
tembu george to his people ogaahni and
his fellows were concerned as to the proper
move the wasuli were not held in high
esteem by their tribe yet kalido had ex-
tended them every courtesy and now he
told the masai his tribe would be honored
to accord the dead man the full ceremony
due a great chieftain not only would it
be an affront to the wasuli to refuse but
there was no other nearby place where
adequate honor could be given

  ki-gor understood the cause of their
worry he took the problem as his own
considered it carefully after a long while
he spoke

  accept the wasuli offer ki - gor
advised the wasuli will regard your
decision as a favor granted

  ogaahni glanced at the faces of his men
saw their assent he stood up

  it is proper he said kalido has
been more than good to us perhaps the
wasuli will take a new path with their
new king it is unjust to hold old grudges
ag-jinst them

  kalido acted swiftly when the masai
told him they were pleased to accept his
offer pie transformed the village into a
beehive of activity the women hurried
to set great fires prepare the traditional
burial feast the warriors oiled their
bodies daubed themselves with the blue
and white designs of mourning the chief
witchdoctor and his assistants in their
fearsome masks stood vigil around tembu
george shrilling incantations with their
rattling gourds and chanting they formed
a protecting barrier to ward off the evil
spirits which the natives believe gather
around the newly dead

  but the dark sullen river which flowed
near the wasuli village was the scene of
greatest activity the river without
sound the natives called it its dark oily
waters flowed with infinite slowness past
the village to disappear into the black dead
swamp of mists from time immemorial

-jungle stories-spring

the wasuli had floated their dead down the
river the mourners halting their canoes
when the swamp mists reached out to
receive the burial canoe

  the wasuli spoke of the swamp in hushed
voices no native ever set foot there it
was an unknown mysterious place given
over to the spirits of the departed the
natives believed no man could enter the
rolling mists and emerge alive

  and now on the river bank the wasuli
busied themselves decorating their war
canoes with wreaths of blue and white flow-
ers special pains were taken with the
canoe which would carry tembu georges
body

  a couch of fragrant grasses was laid
in the canoe covered with lion skins fresh
food and water were placed by the bier
gifts were put in the boats prow and a
supply of weapons laid near the couch with
practiced hands the wasuli rigged floats
on either side of the boat cleverly fashioned
to balance the canoe and hold it steady
on its course from each float a line was
extended back to a following canoe this
giving added control over the burial boats
course

then when all was in readiness the
death drum spoke in two long files
the chanting wasuli approached the hut
where tembu george lay the tall stern-
faced masai walked in the fore of the
procession followed by helene and the
white lord before the hut they halted

  with solemn ceremony tembu george
was lifted on the joined shields of four
specially selected warriors raising the
departed chieftains body high they walked
slowly down the lane formed by the wasuli
the great drums rolling beat spoke out
over the forest and on distant trails in
far-off villages men paused knowing that
a mighty leader went on his last march

  through the village went the procession
past the open gate and down the trail
to the river the long singing files grew
now as the women and children fell in
behind the warriors their lamenting
voices took on a strange unreal quality
as they entered the jungle the giant trees
the tangled creepers and thrusting walls of
bramble caught the wasuli dirge muffled
it threw back no echo

  it was all a bad dream to ki-gor
	jungle

fatalist though he was even at this mo-
ment ki-gor could not grasp the fact of
tembu georges death he had seen many
men die had been near death himself
countless times but he was unprepared
for this time and again his mind told
him it cannot be but when his eyes
rested on the upraised shields he knew
the grim truth

  he took his place with helene in one
of the lead canoes kalido sat at a special
place in the prow tembu george lay
alone in the long carved war canoe which
was his bier

  at kalidos signal two wasuli waded
out and urged the decorated canoe into the
slow current the other boats cast off
and in utter silence for the chanting had
ceased the double row of watercraft began
to move

  the funeral canoe hardly required use
of the guide lines attached to its steadying
floats as though drawn by a magnet it
slid gently downstream headed for the
swamp of the mists

  except for the purl of water against
the boats the breathing of the paddlers
as they kept the loaded canoes together
the quiet continued unbroken for long
minutes then a wasuli in each canoe
lifted a hand drum to his lap smote it in
a sharp quick cadence and far back the
white lord heard the witchdoctor lift
his voice in a high wavering sing-song

  though the river appeared as sluggish
as ever the canoes now moved more swiftly
eagerly nosed through the dark water
ki-gor gave an involuntary shiver the
air was abruptly damp heavy with the
odor of stagnant pools rotting vegetation
along the banks the bright green foliage
was replaced by ragged yellow-mottled
underbrush and the huge trees took on a
dead look their bark blackened their
limbs thick with curtains of moss there
was no life no movement anywhere as the
mourning party swept close to the great
swamp

  ki-gor was shaken from his oppressive
thoughts by helenes voice beside him
look ki-gor the mists and ahead of
them he saw white folds of vapor shimmer
and twist and curl over the river

  he felt the boat surge under him gain
speed as it swept toward the swamp he
wanted to cry out for the procession to

stories

stop he wanted to shout that this evil
unclean haunt was no proper resting place
for a masai chieftain for his friend as
this thought struck him kalido leaned for-
ward knife in hand and with one quick
slash cut the guide rope which bound them
to-tembu george in the other lead boat
another native simultaneously severed the
other rope then paddles bit deep brought
the two lines of following craft almost to
a standstill

  the funeral canoe drove toward the
mists alone sunlight shone on the blue
flowers gleamed on the weapons illumi-
nated the massive black man who lay in
the canoe then the sunlight was gone
and the first fingers of mist curled over
the boats prow the white folds fell
thicker and suddenly the craft was blotted
out

ki-gor sat staring at the water dur-
ing the entire trip back to the vil-
lage his every instinct urged him to get
away as soon as possible lose himself and
his grief in the jungle he had no stomach
for the ceremonies still to come like a
creature of the wild he wanted the com-
panionship at this time of no one but his
mate yet he knew he must not leave
native custom demanded that he stay in
the village until morning

  helene understood the bronzed giants
mood she knew the emotions that surged
through this jungle-reared man the dis-
taste he felt for the feasting and dancing
which were part of the rites to be endured
but as they took their place in the central
compound the couples composed demeanor
betrayed no inkling of their thoughts to
the wasuli

  the fires leaped up as the swift dusk
came the distant rumble of a lion was
drowned out by the abrupt start of the
drums a muscled warrior armed with
spear and shield his body daubed with
white markings moved lithely toward the
bank of drummers he sprang high
brandishing the spear and then with a
leopards grace began the symbolic dance
to the dead

  the white lord at first watched the
whirling posturing figure indifferently
then his gray eyes sharpened with inter-
est as he recognized the dancer it was
kalido king of the wasuli rendering this
the monsters of voo doo isle	

final honor himself to tembu george the
big man made an impressive figure in the
shifting firelight as he moved skillfully
through the barbaric ritual

  by dancing he pays a very great tribute
to the masai doesnt he ki-gor asked
helene

  the white lord nodded in answer his
gaze following kalidos gyrations at
length he said softly he is a strange-
an unusual man and in ki-gors voice
was neither approval nor disapproval

  helene glanced questioningly at ki-gor
she lacked her mates keen insight into
native character a knowledge gained only
through years of contact with the black
men

  he is a strong man the first strong
leader the wasuli have had in many years
ki-gor told her he can do a great deal
of good-or make the wasuli worse than
they have ever been

  well he has made a good beginning
today said helene i know the trouble
you have had with this tribe maybe
kalido can lead them straight

  that is my hope declared the white
lord

 two women shyly approached the
jungle couple now placed gourds filled
with food before them it was a rich feast
with many kinds of meat and fish a variety
of fruits and vegetables and quantities
of native beer the women brought gourds
of cool spring water instead of the harsh
brew to ki-gor and helene still another
evidence of how carefully kalido catered
to the likes of his guests

  the white lord and his mate both pre-
tended to partake of the food but it was
play acting for they were entirely with-
out hunger after the long strenuous
day however helene was thirsty she
thought first of ki-gor and reached for
his drink urged him to take a few swal-
lows at least he shook his head as she
proffered the gourd so with a worried sigh
helene tipped up the container drank
deeply

  the feasting and dancing continued late
into the night the jungle couple were
joined from time to time by the masai or
kalido and it was a long while before they
were able to seek the quiet of the hut
assigned them even then despite their
utter weariness sleep did not come easily

  counter to her usual habit helene was
awake the next morning long before ki-
gor the earth was gray with the first
light and the village was damp and cool
with the mists which had rolled in from
the river during the night helene shiv-
ered in the unaccustomed dampness when
she first awakened but soon she felt hot
and feverish then the chill returned

  she lay quiet until ki-gor awakened
not wishing to worry him and delay their
departure she said nothing though she
felt ever more miserable

  i want to go home ki-gor she told
him lets not stay here even for the
morning meal

  ki-gor ran his hand through her soft
hair caressed her gently i want to go
too he said but ngeeso should arrive
by evening he will feel badly at having
missed the ceremony perhaps we should
wait for him

  helene bit her lip there were fine beads
of perspiration on her forehead around
her mouth she smiled at her mate said
in her most winning voice please lets
go now

  he quickly gave in

  let us go pay our respects to kalido
and we will leave

  ki-gor did not notice that helene
waited for him to walk ahead that she
deliberately lagged behind she kept back
of him to conceal her unsteadiness the
ground seemed to roll beneath her feet
the village weaved and shifted before her
eyes she got through the farewells to the
masai warriors all right but her face was
white and set as they approached kalido

the wasuli king apparently had been
awake for some time he had eaten
heartily according to the empty vessels
around him he was absorbed in thought
so much so that he did not hear the jungle
couple until they stood before him

  he stared blankly at them for a moment
then came out of his reverie with a start
his eyes widened and his mouth half
opened but quickly he was himself
apologizing for day-dreaming

  one travels a long trail quickly in his
thoughts he said smiling and i was far
away when you approached

  kalido studied the white lord curiously
is there something i can do he asked
	jungle

  already you have done much ki-gor
answered we come to thank you

  but you do not mean to leave pro-
tested kalido breaking in on ki-gor i
had hoped you would stay a few days he
paused but i think only of myself let
me walk to the gate with you

  as they turned to walk toward the gate
helene stumbled ki-gors steadying hand
was on her arm in an instant he paid
little attention to the incident assuming
she had slipped on a rock but kalidos
sharp eyes flicked over her taut features
and he frowned

  they were almost to the gate when
helene stumbled again and this- time
despite ki-gors aid she sagged to her
knees the white lord looked at her in
growing alarm her eyes were closed all
color drained from her face and her body
was rigid against his arm he lifted her
up held her tightly his gray eyes con-
fused and alarmed automatically he
turned and strode through the village to
the hut they had left earlier

  ki-gor placed his slim mate on the sleep-
ing mat knelt beside her he was familiar
with many jungle maladies and their treat-
ment but this was something new to him
and he was lost bewildered he turned to
kilado who stood close behind

  what is it he asked desperately
what can we do

  the wasuli king moved nervously his
eyes avoided ki-gors distressed gaze he
cleared his throat but at last he had to
speak

  it is the sickness brought by the mists
he said fearfully it is the fever of the
black water

  then for the only time that any man
could remember there were hot tears in
ki-gors eyes it was the death that had
taken tembu george now it was taking
helene taking her as he watched and
with all his jungle knowledge with all his
skill strength and courage he was help-
less to save her

v

alido watched the white lords
seething torment as he learned
helene was dying waited while the white
giant bent frantically over the scarcely
breathing girl then the wasuli leader

stories

moved quietly to the door stood there so
he could be out of the hut in one leap
he had seen many struck down with the
sickness it was clear to him that after a
few more breaths helene would be gone
kalido was apprensive about how ki-gor
would react

  ki-gors devotion to his wife was a
jungle legend at the least threat of harm
to helene he had been known to turn
from a calm even-tempered man into a
raging relentless battler in losing her
now might not the primitive giant in insane
grief connect the wasuli with his tragedy
turn in all his terrible strength and madness
on those about him kalido thought of
this and was fearful

  but kalidos fears were in vain when
it happened when the white lord real-
ized helene was gone he did nothing he
did not move or speak it was as though
in that moment his body had changed to
stone

  the wasuli leader stared at the great-
shouldered white man crouched there by
his still mate he was stunned by the
terrible mute sorrow apparent in every
line of that powerful body this was not
the reaction he had expected quietly he
backed away from the scene edged his
way from the hut

  word that something was amiss with
helene had spread villagers saw her fall
now a curious muttering crowd was gath-
ered about the hut when kalido turned
to face them they saw in his expression
the truth and a low moan of anguish
sprang simultaneously from many throats
but from sorrow at ki-gors misfortune
the thoughts of the wasuli quickly changed
to how the muscled giant would take this
second blow

  aaaiiieee one said hoarsely i have
seen him mad with battle he will blame
us he will slay us all

  another listened fearfully the whites of
his eyes showing as he remembered seeing
the white lord single-handedly smash and
disperse a band of slavers

  nabunge speaks rightly he will want
to kill he will be like a wpunded lion
mad with the lust for blood

  nervously natives detached themselves
from the group began to scatter from be-
fore the doorway kalido withdrawn into
himself seemed not to notice at first
the monsters of voo doo isle	

then he roused himself saw what occurred

  dangos he exclaimed in a low yet
stinging voice ki-gor will harm no one
he squats motionless by his mate not even
thinking of you

  their kings words quieted them but
the natives continued to give the hut a
wide berth through the long hours of
the day no one approached ki-gor but
still he did not show himself did not so
much as speak a word then as the eve-
ning deepened kalido parted the matting
over the door called softly to the white
lord he hesitated awkwardly when there
was no answer then retreated

  ogaahni waiting nearby as he had
throughout the day glanced with troubled
eyes at kalido

  it is bad he should sit so he mut-
tered first tembu george and now
helene it is too much for him

  moonlight silvered the thatched hut be-
fore ogaahni rose from his post a long
while he stood thinking before he went in to
ki-gor he spoke then as an old friend his
harsh voice soft with emotion speaking as a
father to a son who has been injured
deeply

  but ogaahnis words were as nothing
the giant dimly outlined in the darkness
neither saw nor heard the masai except
for the faint sound of his breathing the
great figure could have been a graven
image ogaahni turned away at last be-
wildered and a little frightened leaving
ki-gor alone

  the masai warrior went with slow steps
to the central campfire as he arrived
there voices sounded at the gate and
when the barriers swung open a group of
men trotted wearily into the firelight
after hearing the death drum tell of
helene ngeeso had led his men despite
their fears of the devil-crowded night
along the dim trails to the village

  there was no banter on the little mans
tongue this time his face was a tight hard
mask as he curbed his emotions squatted
beside ogaahni to hear the tragic story
in detail when he heard ki-gors reac-
tion he shook his head better than
anyone else he understood the white
lord

  it will do no good to try again to-
night ngeeso said in the morning i
will go in and talk to him

preparation for the ceremonies
were completed in the village the next
morning before the pygmy chieftain went
to talk with ki-gor representatives of
other tribes arrived and soon absorbed
the uneasiness of the wasuli as they waited
to see whether ngeeso could approach the
white lord the pygmy was a long time
in the hut his low voice barely audible
outside the walls but as ki-gors oldest
and most trusted friend he succeeded where
the others had failed

  ki-gor followed ngeeso from the hut
the white lords face was gaunt with
fatigue and sorrow there was a queer
blank look in his eyes he stared straight
before him evidencing no recognition of
anyone though death is commonplace in
the jungle ki-gor somehow had never
considered the possibility of helenes death
and the shock of its coming so soon after
tembu georges loss struck him with fear-
ful impact

  in his stunned state the white giant
stood silently by ngeeso allowed the
wasuli to begin the ceremonies without
voicing a word the whole thing seemed
a dream to ki-gor it was something
unreal a dimly grasped event without
meaning or significance

  ki-gor walked beside his friend as the
procession wound through the village
down the path in the forest to the river
bank he moved like an automaton awk-
wardly taking his place in one of the lead
canoes he stared unseeingly at the dec-
orated boat which held his mate ngeeso
his small shoulders bowed under the rapid
events of the past few days sat quietly
beside him

  at this moment a suppressed murmur
ran along the bank men made quick
grabbing motions tried to corner an agile
little form that darted determinedly toward
helenes boat boko the red-haired girls
pet monkey had followed the procession
through the trees and now was racing to
reach the still form of his mistress a
group of men barred him from the boat
but the quick-witted monkey did an about-
face sped to ki-gors boat with a leap
he reached ki-gors shoulder grimaced at
his pursuers and was away again racing
like a tight-rope walker over the guide
line which led to helenes canoe

  ki-gor blinked his eyes and watching
	jungle

the monkey he frowned he turned like
a man roused from deep sleep to look at
ngeeso his frown deepened and he
started to stand up but as the pygmys
hand touched his arm the white lord
settled back

  its her pet ngeeso told the wasuli
leave him alone

  for the second time in three days the
boats slid through the heavy black water
the frown remained on ki-gors face his
glance did not once leave the canoe which
glided smoothly gracefully in the lead
then as the river banks grew blackened
and dead the white mist began to shimmer
and curl in the distance the canoes moved
faster drove toward the beckoning mist

  ki-gor tensed as the gleaming knives
slashed the guide lines the canoes slowed
all but the one flower-covered craft which
sped straight into the whiteness and was
gone no sound broke the oppressive
silence until at kalidos signal paddles
struck the water with soft splashes turned
the canoes sent them gliding upstream

  the blackened moss-hung trees fell
behind the yellow mottled struggling
vines and underbrush gave way to healthy
green foliage now for the first time
ki-gors glance lifted turned from the
river to the tree-lined banks he watched
the branches press close overhead as the
canoe swept along the shore then with
a smooth quick movement which took the
entire party by surprise the white lord
rose grasped a low-hanging branch and
swung out of the boat he was gone with
hardly a sound melting into the jungle

  ngeeso stared after his friend his eyes
troubled but he did not try to call him
back he understood ki-gor was react-
ing to his trouble not like a native but
an animal of the jungle unlike the aver-
age man he wanted not sympathy and
companionship but only solitude in which
to heal his wounds alone

when he first left the canoe ki-gor
threw himself through the trees with
dizzy speed trying through physical exer-
tion to numb himself to the growing
anguish he felt he drove himself unmerci-
fully until at last he flung himself weary
and panting beside a small stream he
drank the cool water greedily realizing
for the first time in many hours how great

stories

was his thirst after a brief rest he
began to travel on foot moving toward no
particular destination merely keeping him-
self on the go

  when night fell ki-gor sought the shel-
ter of a tree lay wide-eyed through the
dark hours he hardly heard the soft
pad of night prowlers the cough of a
lion the myriad familiar noises that
crowded the jungle blackness gnawing
hunger drove him to eat in the morning
but too listless to hunt he only munched
a few pieces of fruit near at hand

  that day and the next he drifted aim-
lessly through the forest he kept ever to
himself avoiding the occasional bands of
natives threading the trails he was trans-
formed into a surly jungle creature fol-
lowing secret little-traveled ways moving
with cat-like stealth through shadowred
fastnesses though he sought no goal al-
ways he kept in motion urged on by an
inner restlessness he could not deny

  red-eyed and disheveled ki-gor came
at last to a place that made him pause he
sniffed the dank air his nostrils tightening
at the heavy odor of rot and stagnant water
fie looked down to find he stood deep in
mud his face puzzled he noted his sur-
roundings - closely for the first time in
hours great moss-hung trees their black-
ened trunks mottled with fungus lay all
about him

  and all at once he knew where he was
despite his effort to flee into the solitude
of the jungle to escape the memory of this
place his subconscious mind had guided
him back to the swamp of mists he
looked down a bleak lane of trees and in
the distance saw the restless white curtain
of mist which marked the edge of the
swamp he felt desperately alone in this
desolate rotting waste and realizing how
utterly lacking in life the entire area was
an odd nameless fear laid hold of him

  but still he stood in the unclean wetness
watching the mists shimmering movement
feeling the painful silence thrust at his ear
drums with mounting violence he stood
there wanting to leave but somehow power-
less to go he watched the swaying white-
ness until his eyes ached with strain

  and then suddenly he started a dark
form moved in the bare limbs of a tree
before him or wras it his imagination 

  his muscles tensed until they were tight
the monsters of voo doo isle	

with pain he searched the leafless branches
trying to locate the thing that crept over
the wet bark what kind of creature
would seek this barren waste fragments
of stories born of native superstition
flashed through his mind he gave an
involuntary shudder did this furtive
shadowy being come from the swamp of
mists 

  then he saw it again the creature
darted into view was gone and then mov-
ing ever nearer it came in sight once
more ki-gor stared hard and smiling
grimly at himself he relaxed it was a
monkey a very muddy very bedraggled
monkey

  with the spell which had bound him now
broken ki-gor turned on his heel began
to pick his way toward dry ground he
wanted no more of this ugly bog yet be-
fore he took five steps he stopped in his
tracks his mind was functioning normally
for the first time in days picking up the
threads so abruptly snapped off in those
terrible hours in the wasuli village

  that monkey the thought of it held
him he pressed his hand against his
forehead searched his mind for an answer
that lay hidden there and abruptly memory
surged over him the monkey was boko
of course yet how could boko be here
when he swept into the mists in helenes
eattoc-

  ki-gor wheeled around and his deep
voice shattered the quiet as he called to
the monkey

  boko did not wait for the familiar voice
to call him twice with shrill relieved
cries he raced along the branches leaped
into ki-gors arms he hugged the white
lord about the neck chattering explosively
in his delight

  after this display of affection boko
made an unexpected bewildering move
he tore himself loose from ki-gors arms
leaped back into the tree raced a few
steps toward the mist then he stopped
looked back at the white lord muttered
excitedly

  come boko lets get out of this place
ki-gor said

  but the monkey only grew more upset
darting back to ki-gor then starting
toward the swamp puzzled the jungle
man watched the pets antics a full minute
before their significance dawned on him

the white lord pursued his lips in a low
whistle of surprise

  boko meant to lead him into the swamp
of mists

ki-gor could not fathom the little
animals purpose perhaps in leap-
ing from the canoe after it passed into the
mists boko had discovered something that
was a treasure in his eyes certainly only
a matter of supreme importance to his
small mind would cause him to raise such
a disturbance

  the swamp was distasteful to ki-gor
but in reverting to normal his dread of
the place was gone he considered a
minute then shrugging his shoulders in
surrender he gave in to the pet after
all what difference did it make where
he went if it would please helenes be-
loved boko then he would indulge the
creature

  the sure-footed jungle man picked his
way cautiously over the dangerous ground
unwilling to risk attempting to follow boko
through the rotting trees the branches
would hold the monkeys slight weight but
supporting ki-gors muscled bulk was an-
other matter it was slow difficult
progress but the white lord growing
steadily more intrigued with bokos strange
antics worked his way to the edge of the
mist

  he hesitated at this shifting barrier
realizing that in passing it he was breaking
a native taboo then with a deep breath
he plunged ahead following the sound of
bokos voice the fog thickened with his
every step and ki-gor began to wonder
how much further he could continue
began to doubt the wisdom of humoring
the monkeys whim feeling his way along
blindly ki-gors feet struck solid ground
no longer sank in sticky mud

  abruptly the mist thinned a few steps
further and the white lord was free of
the clinging fog he walked faster now
noting that the ground continued to grow
firmer the blackened moss-choked trees
gave way to living timber boko romped
ahead through the branches turning from
time to time to make sure ki-gor still
followed

  ki-gor abandoned the slow tiresome
foot travel swung into the trees and moved
forward at a faster pace after a time he
	jungle

came to the bank of a river and studying
its dark waters he knew it was the same
river that flowed past the wasuli village
following the bank he watched the river
broaden grow more sluggish

  he was unprepared for the next scene
that greeted him a great lake opened
before him a vast expanse of water into
which the river of silence emptied a
bow-shot from where he stood was a large
island its trees and foliage brightly green
in the sunlight he studied the rim of
beach and his eyes narrowed with interest
canoe after canoe was drawn up on the
beach

  he wondered at this secret of the swamp
of mists for so many canoes were clear evi-
dence that many natives lived on the island
then after the first surprise of his dis-
covery was past he noted the craft more
slowly more than half of the canoes
were decaying and broken half frown-
ing he glanced up and down the beach
on which he stood and was startled to
find countless more of the native boats
extending as far as the eye could see

  and now he understood he had mo-
mentarily forgotten the purpose of this
place it was the graveyard of the wasuli
these rotting canoes were eerie tomb-
stones revealing the numberless natives
who had floated down the silent river to
their final rest he glanced at the muddy
lake waters struck with the thought of
how many craft must rest in the murky
depths

  he found his eyes searching suddenly
for a canoe still bright with decorations
and he recoiled realizing what he was
doing not wanting in his heart to find
this particular one he called softly to
boko meaning to leave the lake turn back
to the land of living

  but against his will he glanced once
more at the island he tensed and dropped
to one knee behind a concealing bush
across the water two men strolled into
view on the canoe-littered beach

  one man was white an immaculately
dressed distinguished looking fellow the
other wtas a squat thick-bodied black
ki-gor watched the odd pair stroll out of
sight down the beach then the white
lord squatted in hiding a long time watch-
ing for the appearance of other men but
there was no other sign of life he debated

stories

briefly with himself then decided he could
never rest if he left without learning the
reason for the white mans presence in the
swamp of mists

ki-gor rose and moved swiftly along
the bank his keen eyes flicking over
the canoes lined along the way the
wasuli make their craft well so it was not
long before he found one that would safely
carry him he noted the paddles remained
in the boat but all weapons gifts and
trinkets had disappeared

  the white lord was armed only with
a knife but he anticipated no trouble
after all the advantage of surprise would
be his boko huddled in the bow as the
jungle man sent the canoe skimming as
fast as he dared considering the degree
of its seaworthiness his skillful paddle
bit the water without sound

  with one final thrust he sent the canoe
skidding through the shallow water to beach
quietly in the soft mud he picked up
boko waded to dry ground and releasing
the monkey set out to follow the pair
he had seen from the mainland he ran
with the swift gliding step of a person
born to the jungle trails his keen eyes
keeping him easily on the track he had
no special plan in mind meaning only
to confront the two ask them bluntly how
they came to be in the swamp and - what
they did there this fdrbidden land was
a strange place for a well-dressed white
man and stranger still for a native

  ki-gor heard the low sound of voices
conversing in the wasuli tongue one
voice was that of the white man and
listening the white lord marveled at
the ease and fluency with which the fel-
low handled the awkward language the
men had turned and were now walking
back toward him the white lord put
boko down and stopping waited in plain
view for the odd pair they came along
soon strolling unhurriedly the native pay-
ing close attention- to his masters words

  the black was the first to sense ki-gors
presence he looked up startled his eyes
widening when he saw the tanned giant
motionless in the path he recoiled jab-
bering a warning to his companion the
white man looked up now but except for
a faint arching of his eyebrows he betrayed
no emotion
the monsters of voo doo isle	

  ho i come without wreapons ki-
gor declared announcing his peaceful
intentions through the traditional native
greeting

  the smile formed slowly almost delib-
erately on the white mans face he
walked forward extending his hand

  you gave us a start here friend he
said visitors as you can gather are
rather a rare thing in these parts

  ki-gor shook hands awkwardly remem-
bering not to grip his hand too hard in
this unfamiliar greeting he was aware
though apparently his full attention was
focused on the white man that the native
watched him with hostile eyes

  im sorry ki-gor said i saw you
walking along the beach and wondered
what you did on this island this land is
taboo you know it might go hard with
you if the wasuli learned you entered
the land of their dead

  with ki - gors words the mans
strangely piercing gaze grew more intense

  the wasuli will not learn im here
he said crisply unless you tell them i
trust that will not happen

  ki - gor sensed a threat in the quick
answer

  he did not seek trouble but if this
pair wanted it it was a matter of in-
difference to him he shifted his weight
slightly stood perfectly balanced to counter
any hostile move

  i asked why you were here he said
and i expect an answer this time his
voice rang coldly white men do not
trample the beliefs and laws of the natives
in this territory

  the white man sensed the abrupt shift in
ki-gors attitude his glance flicked
over the jungle mans superbly muscled
body then he smiled spread his arms in
a sweeping gesture

  dont misunderstand me he said
im glad to tell you-rather show you-
why i am here you will see i have a good
reason to be here im not entirely an
intruder this has been my home for
many years

  he broke off his conversation a moment
to address the squat muscular black who
fidgeted restless beside him

  stop scowling malu this man is our
friend

  malu nodded obediently threw a thin

smile at ki-gor but the obvious suspicion
did not leave his ugly face

  im a doctor-doctor ralph devere
the man resumed it so happens this place
is ideal for my important studies but
instead of trying to tell you come to my
laboratory and let me show you my experi-
ments

ki - gor thawed under the doctors
flow of words the man was so open
about his work so anxious to explain it that
the white lord felt perhaps he had been
too abrupt after all he considered he
too was an intruder in the swamp of
mists

  i am ki-gor the white lord said
simply as they began to walk along the
path hardly a hand of suns ago my mate
was floated dowm the river of silence
i could not stay long in such a place of
sadness

  mentioning helene ki - gor was re-
minded of her pet he stopped looked
around for boko the monkey had dis-
appeared which was strange for ordinarily
he took a keen delight in inspecting new
people after repeated calls boko came
reluctantly from his hiding place behind
a bush he made a wide circle around dr
devere and the native darted nervously
up to ki-gor

  malus hard eyes studied the bedraggled
little monkey as intently as though it were
the first one of its kind he had ever seen
under the blacks gaze the pet began
to tremble and leaped into the security
of ki-gors arms the white lord was
puzzled by this behavior because neither
devere nor the native had seen the monkey
before so there was no discernible reason
for the creature to be afraid

  so you ar ki-gor declared devere
ignoring bokos presence no wonder
you came to investigate us ive heard of
your trouble with renegade whites wtho
drift in here to victimize the natives but
im truly sorry to hear about your wife
even in this remote place i have heard
tales of her beauty and goodness

  it was the fever of the black water
explained ki-gor painfully you are a
doctor why dont you try to find a cure
for this fever it seems to infect only
the wasuli region

  the doctor turned his piercing eyes on
	jungle

ki-gor hesitated before he spoke for
the first time the white lord noted that
the impact of those black unblinking eyes
was like a physical blow deveres tone
was low-pitched as though he confided a
secret for the first time

  i can cure the fever he leaned close
to the white lord dont you see the
fever is one of the main reasons i am
here it is the basis of my studies in
learning to control it i have opened the
door to even greater findings

  there was a real fervor in deveres voice
almost an awe at the miracles he foresaw
because of his successful research

  you will see what i am doing and i
guarantee you will be surprised he con-
tinued in fact you may be able to help
me for a long time ive needed someone
like you there are some natives helping
but they arent much good in this kind of
work

  if you can keep others from dying of
the fever i will help any way i can
ki-gor told him

  ah fine devere saidenthusiastically
if what i plan succeeds not one single
person will ever have the fever again
they walked on in silence both sunk in
their own thoughts about the wasuli
malady until the doctor glanced up de-
clared well here we are at my quarters

  ki-gor was not prepared for the sight
that greeted him he had expected a
modest camp with one or two thatched huts
and a handful of native workers instead
he saw a series of large well-built log
buildings and many natives moved about
their tasks the entire place was unusu-
ally neat and clean as the approached
one of the buildings ki-gor saw how care-
fully and solidly it was constructed those
massive walls would task the strength of
a bull elephant

  another unusual thing attracted the
white lords notice not a single native
stopped work to stare at the stranger if
anything the speed with which the blacks
labored was increased by the appearance
of devere and the white lord ordinarily
the least distraction was welcomed by na-
tives as a reason for shelving their duties

  the doctor led the way into the building
through a series of comfortably furnished
rooms where he apparently lived and then
into a large clean white room

stories

  this is my laboratory he said
proudly

  to ki-gors untutored eyes it was
merely a room filled with an unusual jum-
ble of bottles glass tubes and odd-looking
contraptions he had no way of knowing
that this was an exceptionally well equipped
laboratory

  you see i first learned of this fever
of the black water as the natives call it
when i was practicing in america my
complacent associates did not appreciate
my research devere said his lips curling
scornfully

  they tried to ruin me but i fooled
them i came here secretly and carried
on my work and now my success is
almost complete

ki-gor looked puzzled you mean
they fought you

  devere threw back his head and laughed
an unpleasant humorless laugh

  yes he said they fought me be-
cause they were afraid i found that the
secret of the fever is also the secret of
growth i knew that if i learned the why
of the fever then i would know how to
speed up or retard the development of a
human or an animal but my little world
did not understand he sneered they
said i was cruel unbalanced and a lot of
other foolish things

  the mans strange manner began to make
ki-gor uneasy he understood little of
this harangue about the outside world
but the doctors nervous intensity appeared
hardly normal to the jungle man

  but you can cure the fever ki-gor
asked interested in that one point only

  yes of course devers answered im-
patiently i can cause it and i can cure
it but the fever has become the least
important part of my research he
pointed to the monkey ki-gor held take
that creature for instance with a few
months of treatment i can alter its looks
size and personality completely

  he paced the floor his hands clasped
behind him his thoughts ranging far be-
yond the confines of the room his black
eyes sparked with his disturbing inner
drive

  i fear the doctor stated you dont
realize the fascinating possibilities he
swung about in his pacing faced the white
the monsters of voo doo isle



lord triumphantly my findings may
well change the whole world then we
will see what those fools who drove me
out say

  while the doctor talked malu stood
with his arms folded over his chest star-
ing balefully at the white lord ki-gor
almost forgot the black was present so
little did the warriors obvious enmity
matter to him

  i have experimented with many ani-
mals devere told the jungle man now
im ready to experiment with the higher
order of life-with man but the experi-
ments are exacting and i must have only
the finest physical and mental specimens
to work with

  he broke off his discourse and his eyes
flicked over the white lords splendid
physique his meaning was obvious

  i am interested only in curing the
fever declared ki-gor flatly

  the doctor laughed unpleasantly slapped
his right hand against his thigh at this
sound malu stepped forward with lightning
speed smashed a rock-hard fist against
ki-gors temple staggered by the unex-
pected attack ki-gor swayed dropped the
screaming boko to the floor twice more
before the white lord could swing to
face him the squat warrior drove pile-
driving blows into the jungle man

  then devere snatched up a length of
wood from a nearby table stepped forward
smiling

  he struck hard and mercilessly ki-gor
crumpled to the floor

  devere put down the piece of wood care-
fully stared down at the unconscious figure

  well malu he said pleasantly fate
is with me despite kalidos bungling
this fool came straight into my hands

pain stabbed through helene her
chest was an aching throbbing hurt as
she strained to breathe she whirled and
spun in an endless black funnel then
sparks showered up and a sheet of flame
seared through her body

  abruptly the agony was gone her
breath came easily she opened her eyes
slowly and though the room wavered in
rainbow-hued mist she could see after a
time even the difficulty with her eyes was

gone and she looked about her wonder-
ingly

  the red-haired girl lay in a large high-
ceilinged room helene tried to move
found she was securely bound to a heavy
table turning her head she saw cabinets
of equipment test-tubes x-ray machines
shining medical instruments she was be-
wildered by this strange room at a loss to
understand how or why she was there

  her mind was a blank as to her past
she could think and reason but she could
not remember her bonds pressed tightly
against her arms and legs and trying to
move to ease the numbness she caused the
wooden table to creak

  out of sight behind her a chair scraped
on the floor as someone stood up helene
heard slow measured footsteps approach
her without a word the man came up
beside her studied her face closely he
was a lean distinguished-looking man gray
at the temples with black burning eyes
he took her pulse carefully then leaned
forward to pull back one of her eyelids
note every detail of the eye

  helene watched the mans calm ex-
pressionless face tried to remember who
he was by his manner she knew he was a
doctor but he was utterly unfamiliar his
inspection completed he pursed his lips
stood watching her with a curious detached
air

  please stop standing there and undo
these straps she said in sudden anger
do you think im comfortable here

  her words shattered his reverie he
roused himself from his thoughts and with
a sardonic smile began to loosen her bonds
he place an arm under her shoulders
helped her to sit up on the edge of the
table

  excuse my thoughtlessness he said
im so little around ladies i forgot my
manners he watched her bite her lips
with the pain of moving the soreness in
your muscles will pass soon he reassured
her

  she got down from the table gingerly
walked slowly about easing the stiffness
from her limbs the mans eyes followed
her running over her slim firm body

  perhaps it is a good thing you are
here after all he declared suddenly

  helene looked at him frowning still
hoping her memory would flow back any
	jungle

minute and she would know what this was
all about

  i wondered at first he continued but
i decided to take a chance now i believe
ill be glad maybe it is a good idea to
have a woman around here

  the mans words made little sense to
helene but she did not like his tone she
walked up to him her gaze cool and
steady

  im dr ralph devere he put in
quickly before she could speak and what
is your name

  automatically she opened her mouth to
reply but no words came flushing she
turned away

  so your memory is gone devere said
softly i guessed as much

  all right then helene declared angrily
who am i and where am i

  dr devere walked toward her you
are in the most isolated forgotten spot in
the congo you are in my laboratory on
an island surround by water and as to
who you are that really wont matter to
you here

  he reached an insinuating hand for her
waist as his fingers touched her bare
midriff helene twisted away and struck
hard her open palm struck devere full
in the mouth made him curse with pain
he drew back his fist to hit the red-haired
girl and then he caught himself imme-
diately he was calm self-controlled again
but his black unblinking eyes sparked with
anger

  excuse me my dear he said his lips
twisting in an ugly sneer i will not be
so forward again i will wait for you to
come to me next time and i warrant i
wont have too long to wait

  he raised his voice in a shout malu
malu the barrel-chested black came
into the room at a run at his masters call
scarcely glancing at helene the white man
strode from the room ordering the native
to bring the girl along

  helene was shoved roughly down a long
hall out into the bright sunlight and then
into another building from the outside
the building had looked much the same as
the one that housed deveres laboratory
but inside it was drastically different
helene saw that it was a strange and ter-
rible jail she was led slowly down a
long corridor and made to stop and peer

stories

into each of the strongly barred cells the

creatures in those cells were monsters
from a nightmare

  the sight and stench of them made
her head reel her stomach tighten with
nausea

in the first cell a gigantic creature smoth-
ered in gross rolls of fat lay gasping
on the floor gnarled twisted legs too
weak to hold up the vast weight pawed
aimlessly at the wooden floor from time to
time ever renewing a vain attempt to rise
the hair had long since fallen from the
creatures skin and its body was covered
with livid red patches

  what-what is it asked helene sick-
ened by the unbelievable sight

  devere glanced at her smiled

  why this my dear was once an ordi-
nary wild boar but under my capable
care you can see how beautifully he has
developed i admit of course the job
could be improved on but we all have to
learn

  in the next compartment a creature with
a great swollen belly hobbled awkwardly
about its overlong arms trailed the floor
dragging like limp useless appendages its
huge sightless eyes bulged from its head
and saliva ran in constant driblets from
its gaping mouth

  that was one of my pet monkeys ex-
plained devere hurrying helene on to the
next cell as though he were displaying
priceless thoroughbreds and here is a
splendid specimen

  in a far corner of the cell a black figure
squatted helene could vaguely make out
its monstrous legs but could see little more
in the shadows

  up up you stupid dango so we can
admire you the white man yelled

  a hoarse pitiful moan sounded from the
dark corner the dark mass of flesh quiv-
ered and then straining and whimpering
the tremendous bulk fought to its feet it
stood swaying back and forth having diffi-
culty retaining its balance its head was a
swollen bulbous thing without a single
clear feature except for two tiny red eyes
every part of the body was distorted
elephantine in size yet clearly this dreadful
embodiment once had been a human being

  that--why this is a man helene
gasped what on earth is this horrible
the monsters of voo doo isle	

place what terrible thing are you doing
here 

  the doctor savored the horror which
permeated the girl he watched her shud-
der tear her gaze from the cell

  it is plain isnt it he said i am
making a few improvements on nature i
am learning to create men or beasts in the
image i desire i can make them grow to
whatever size or shape i want

  helene drew away from devere it is
unbelievable anyone could do this to any
creature let alone a fellow man

  devere laughed mockingly at the sick-
ened girl

  a world-shaking discovery such as
mine is not made easily my dear nat-
urally i cant expect perfection in the
beginning but each experiment brings
me closer to mygoal you are letting the
childish emotion of pity blind you to the
true worth of what you are seeing

  he looked from helene to the grotesque
example of his handiwork inside the cell
from the expression on his face it was
difficult to tell whether he was gloating or
admiring

   if this sight upsets you he continued
his voice a thin grating rasp you should
have been here in the beginning we really
had some unusual sights then didnt we
malu 

  the blacks mouth sheared in what was
meant to be a grin he nodded his head
in quick agreement remembering with
pleasure the distorted bodies which had
filled the cell block

  i believe the spadework is done now
devere declared proudly i am ready to
create a race of supermen a race of giants
then we will see what those scientific
nincompoops in the united states and
europe will say-after it is too late for
whatever they might try to say or do to
matter

a strange elation at the thought of
what he would do seized the white
man he turned briskly strode down the
corridor he made helene stop at each
cell while he gave a full explanation con-
cerning the unfortunate being under inspec-
tion helene by now was too sickened by
the horrors of the place to see clearly the
parade of moaning pain-wracked mon-
strosities but devere continued to drg

her along his words tumbling out in an
increasingly excited outpouring

   though she tried to close her ears to the
mans words helene could not escape his
meaning he foresaw himself as leader of
a race of obedient giants tremendous men
anxious to do his least bidding ready to
wreak vengeance on a world he thought
was arrayed against him though his
twisted mind had mastered the secret of
making flesh bone and muscle grow far
beyond its normal limits she gathered from
his explanation the unnatural process
drained all semblance of mentality from
his grotesque subjects left them great
moronic hulks of flesh

  then the sound and stench of the cell
block was behind her and helene drew
gulps of fresh air into her lungs but
the ordeal her captor planned was only
beginning fie led her to the next building
and thinking she was to be shown more
awful sights the red-haired girl threw all
her strength into an attempt to jerk loose
from malu

  she fought silently desperately she
pitted speed and agility against the blacks
strength the slim gold-skinned girl
twisted bit and kicked hoping by the sud-
den violence of her attack to slip free but
all the power in her lithe body was as
nothing against the natives steel muscles
he cuffed her roughly twisted her back
until it seemed her spine would crack and
then sliding a sweaty arm under her he
picked her up flung her over his shoulder

  the whip would quiet her malu
eagerly suggested standing with the girl
held helplessly

   there are better ways to do these things
malu his master said with satisfaction
a few hours in the common cell with my
beginners and she will beg for the shelter
of my protecting arms

  he laughed coarsely at the sadistic plan
he was employing to break helenes spirit
anticipating the sight of her begging him
to take her from the cell at any cost

  for once malu did not show unqualified
approval of his masters ideas the blacks
arm tightened around the girls bare thighs
clearly he considered her too fair a prize
to throw to the doctors newest prisoners
devere knew the thought in malus mind
but instead of being irritated the natives
disgruntled manner tickled him
	jungle

  you know the effect my first few in-
jections have on those men he said
blandly come now carry her inside and
lets watch the dangos fight for her

  malu hesitated a moment but only for
a moment he too was deathly afraid
of this lean cruel white man and dared not
oppose his will he walked forward when
at deveres call two natives inside the
building threw open the door

  the interior of this structure was greatly
different from the other one helene -had
been taken through instead of building
rows of individual cells devere had con-
structed four walls and a roof over a deep
rectangular pit the prisoners were placed
together in this pit for their initial series
of injections later those who survived
the terror of the early treatment and were
judged worthy of continued study were
removed to another building and placed in
individual cells

  a walk around the four sides of the pit
allowed the guards to look down on their
charges watch their every move the
only way to get in or out of the pit was
by using a ladder which the guards lowered
from their vantage point about twenty-
five prisoners milled about on the earth
floor some of them charged back and
forth frenziedly while others staggered
around with the difficulty of drunken men
they screamed and fought smashed
blindly against each other and against the
walls occasionally one would drop to
the floor jerking convulsively only to climb
to his feet again as soon as the fit passed

  it was apparent that deveres growth
drug wrought drastic changes in their ner-
vous systems and physical structures from
the time of the first injection the
prisoners were like caged beasts driven
mad by mistreatment and confinement
though they had not yet been under treat-
ment long enough to lose the look of men
the restraints and disciplines by which men
live had shattered under the mental and
bodily changes induced by deveres drug

  at the doctors command guards has-
tened to drop the ladder into the pit the
scrape of the ladder striking the prison
floor brought instant silence the prisoners
stopped their pacing turned their faces up
to watch the guards above them the
lowering of the ladder ordinarily meant
more hated injections for the tormented

stories

men the apprehensive faces watched
without understanding as malu put helene
down the ladder forced her to start climb-
ing down by stamping his foot on her
fingers

helene halted halfway down glanced
at the natives waiting below a
chill ran through her at the sight of those
strange tense men who had not yet
realized she was a prisoner also she
looked up into deveres sneering counte-
nance knew he expected her to cringe and
beg him not to make her enter the pit see-
ing his complete lack of normal feeling
the madness in his glittering inhuman eyes
she felt a depth of hate and contempt burst
over her that she never had known before

  then calmly deliberately she made her
choice the strange void in her memory
kept her from knowing who she was or
how she came to be in this place of hell
but it did not in the least affect the cour-
age and self-control which ki-gor many
times had admired helene went bravely
into the pit and as she climbed down the
last few rungs she saw the shocked sur-
prise which flashed over deveres face
he was pained at this unexpected turn in a
game which he thought he had planned so
well he wanted only to bluff the girl
frighten her into cringing obedience and
now the little fool betrayed him by choos-
ing to face the prisoners instead of going
on her knees to him

  his chagrin showed plainly then his
face darkened in anger and clenching his
fists he sprang to the edge of the pit he
glared at helene his mouth working spas-
modically as he fought to speak then
remembering that malu and the guards
were watching him closely he brought
himself under control turned on his heels
and strode from the building

  helene smiled a thin fleeting smile at
her triumph but in the next moment as
her feet struck the damp earth she took
a deep breath turned grimly to meet what-
ever fate awaited her she stood tautly
determined to boldly face these abnormal
beings her eyes swept slowly narrowly
over the scattered prisoners trying to
judge them weigh their attitude

  they were all big men larger than aver-
age as though they had been carefully
selected for their fate they were broad
the monsters of voo doo isle



shouldered deep chested men with the
muscled arms and backs of warriors about
half of the prisoners showed already the
ravages of the growth drug their features
thickening their once perfectly propor-
tioned bodies beginning to lose their sym-
metry for these time ran out quickly
soon they would be lumbering mountain-
ous hulks locked away in individual cells

  these who showed the effects of de-
veres injectons in their physical changes
were slower and duller than their fellows
the newer prisoners were more frenzied
the shock of the powerful drug blasting
their personalities whipping them into a
delirium of meaningless action these men
had not entirely lost their ability to grasp
events around them but they no longer
reasoned clearly they were like drowning
men floundering and fighting in a last
meaningless burst of strength to save them-
selves

  helene was undecided whether to walk
toward the men or stand where she was
behind her she heard the ladder pulled
up by the guards as though the ladders
removal was signal a babble of sound went
up from the prisoners they began to walk
toward her converging from all sides

helene fought off a feeling of panic
as the strange unsmiling blacks
closed about her she managed a calm
friendly expression but she dared not
trust her voice to speak there was some-
thing about these tortured beings that
frightened her made her flesh crawl

  the men stood watching her devouring
her with their eyes no one spoke or
made the least frendly gesture then one
native larger than the others shouldered
his way to the front

  this woman is mine he cried his
voice a hoarse ugly snarl she is mine
and i will kill the one who touches her

  he moved in front of helene facing the
others his great arms held ready for the
man who dared challenge him helene
looked at the tense group and she knew
then that these prisoners were reduced to
jungle beasts battered by the growth drug
from men to savage ruthless creatures
there was a ripple of movement as the
group stirred and grumbled at the big fel-
lows unexpected action

   with a savage growl a prisoner launched

himself from the crowd drove at helenes
self-appointed master the powerful black
was ready for the onslaught he smashed
his fists against the smaller man like clubs
and as his assailant stumbled he lowered
his head butted with pile-driving power
the smaller prisoner grunted explosively as
he fell beneath the shock then screamed as
he was picked up flung bodily over the
crowd

  the big man whirled back to his post
before helene stood with his shoulders
hunched forward ready to meet any other
attacker helene upset as siie was could
not help noticing the swift sureness with
which the man moved his balance was as
perfect as that of a normal man

  she watched him slash into another chal-
lenger pound him with lightning blows
fell him with a rock-hard right hand that
exploded with sudden and terrible accuracy
against an exposed jaw the man fought
with a murderous intensity though his
opponents were brutal powerful fighters
they attacked wildly without plan or
method too the drug had destroyed their
coordination made their movements jerky
uncertain apparently the injections had
failed to harm this ebony giants nervous
system

  the merciless battling of this man
stirred helenes memory there was some-
thing familiar about his method of fighting
but looking at his massive figure she could
not remember ever having seen him before
his body was cut and scratched and he
had an ugly scalp wound but in his ter-
rible anger these wounds suffered in some
previous conflict were forgotten he
crouched facing his fellow prisoners his
flaming eyes alert for the least hostile
move he meant this woman to be his
and clearly any who thought to oppose
him must be prepared to battle to the death

  helenes face was drawn and white as
she saw the opposition to the big man
waver and fade there was no escape for
her she was trapped knowing full well
no help would come from the guards
strangely the will to live flamed even
higher in these lost men than in normal
persons and thus they fell back before
the grim deadliness of the big fellow he
alone of the entire group was willing to
fight to the end for this pale-skinned
woman and his dreadful ferocity chilled
	jungle

their ardor for combat muttering they
split off singly and in small groups drifted
away

   helene stood alone with her captor he
had not turned his face to the girl since
that first moment when he thrust his way
forward to lay claim to her now that the
others were gone she waited tensely she
saw the tight-strung muscles in his back
relax heard him draw a great breath into
his lungs as though he sighed with relief
slowly he wheeled about

   her eyes hostile and hate - filled her
small hands clenched into fists helene
watched him like a cornered animal and
then a curious thing happened he gave
her a friendly reassuring smile and when
he spoke his voice was soft and reassuring

   i didnt know how it would go at first
he said but luck was with us and i
bluffed them off with sudden concern
he added but how on earth did you get
here 

   abruptly he stopped talking he looked
at her curiously a frown creasing his fore-
head then realizing what was wrong he
gave a low exclamation at his stupidity

  im a fool helene why of course
you dont know me he said self-accusingly
i was the same way the first day but your
memory will come back soon it must be
from some drug they gave us in the wasuli
village

   he paused rubbed his chin thoughtfully
helenes eyes never left him yet they were
puzzled now instead of hostile

  you werent in the wasuli village
though he said suddenly

   helene cut him off recognition dawned
in her face the word wasuli pierced
the dark curtain which obscured her mind

  tembu george she exclaimed thank
heavens it is you she struggled to re-
member more i was in the village ki-
gor and i came when he heard you were
dying her eyes widened as she realized
what she said but it cant be

i tembu georges expression grew grim
i wasnt badly hurt somehow one of
deveres monsters got away from here
he explained i saw it tried to kill it
but it charged me knocked me senseless
my men carried me to the wasuli village
and when i came to only kalido was with
me i made the mistake of telling him
what i had seen

stories

tembu georges jaw set hard as
he recalled the wasuli kings treachery
the masai were an honorable people and
one thing they never forgot or forgave was
underhanded trickery by a pretended friend
helene knew the fate in store for kalido
if ever he fell into the masai chieftains
hands

  kalido lost no time in pressing a sweet
tasting drink on me tembu george con-
tinued thats the last i remember until
i woke up with that devere standing over
me those two are working togtther
with kalido selecting the victims for the
doctor they were afraid of what might
happen if i told people about the monster
helenes mind was clearing now as
she listened to the masai leader she traced
back over the happenings in the wasuli
village one revealing incident stood out
clearly

  of course youre right she said i
see it all now kalido was trying to drug
ki-gor that night at the mourning feast
i drank from ki-gors water gourd he
didnt touch it

  at mention of the white lord of the
jungle tembu georges eyes gleamed ki-
gor was free the black man was suddenly
filled with hope

  devere hasnt given me an injection
yet he said thankfully ki-gor will
find us i know maybe he will find us
before we get like those others

  helene bit her lips and said nothing
let tembu geoorge hope if he liked for
once she looked for no help from her mate
ki-gor would follow her to the ends of
the earth if he suspected she were alive
but he would accept her death just as she
and ki-gor had accepted tembu georges
death without the least suspicion anything
was wrong deveres plan was as perfect
as could be devised no one would every
suspect that the fever of the black water
was only a man-made malady a drug which
gave its victims every appearance of death

  helene looked across the pit to the pitiful
group of prisoners how soon would it
be before tembu george was one of those
maddened abnormal creatures how soon
until she herself was a grotesque swollen
being more animal than human a feel-
ing of utter hopelessness swept over her
and she pressed her hand hard against her
eyes to shut out the sight
the monsters of voo doo isle	

vii

dim gray light filled the room it
was a small room with one tiny win-
dow high up on the wall ki-gor blinked
his eyes slowly became aware of the ache
in his head he stared at the unfamiliar
surroundings wondering at first how he
came there

  then remembering devere he climbed
to his feet it came to him with a rush
now thinking of malu and the doctor
his face grew flint-hard a cold fury pos-
sessed him they had caught him off
guard once but the next time

  he padded about the room trying the
door testing the timbers in the walls his
tremendous strength was of no avail against
the logwalls or the locked door he was
securely held but this fact caused him no
concern in the past few days the white
lord had suffered much so much that he
was past giving a great deal of importance
to his own safety with both tembu
george and helene gone the taste of life
was no longer too good

  ki-gor thought now not so much of
escape as revenge all the hurt he had
suffered centered on devere and malu he
meant to pay them back no matter what the
cost they had made their mistake he
felt in leaving his hands and feet free
sooner or later someone would come to get
him and then his opportunity to even the
score also would come

  the white lord sat down on the dirt
floor an hour went by and then another
and he hardly moved he waited with the
patience of the jungle apparently calm and
relaxed yet alert to the smallest sound
and the anger in him grew

  then footsteps shuffled along the hall
halted at his room the door creaked
open and devere stood there a sardonic
smile on his lean face ki-gor knew there
were others outside but he could not see
them

  ah you were waiting for me the
doctor said you will learn i always think
of my guests i never forget them espe-
cially a guest as valued as you

  ki-gor remained sitting in the middle
of the small room he regarded devere
without expression calmly awaiting the
moment when the doctor approached him

-jungle stories-spring

  i have some good news for you devere
continued in his mocking tone of false
cheer tembu george and your wife are
both alive and so far quite well they
are right here i might add

  ki-gor neither moved nor spoke in-
deed the man must take him for a fool
had he not seen both helene and tembu
george lying in death it was a poor kind
of joke even to use to torture a person

  so you do not believe me said the
doctor reproachfully kalido did provide
an impressive ceremony for each of them
but the wasuli king and i are old hands
at this game we give the customers
their moneys worth

  devere laughed uproarously

  they didnt die they didnt even have
any kind of illness this fever of the
black water you talk about is merely a
drug which i make and which kalido gives
to people i want to work on

  interest sparked in ki-gors gray eyes
he could not conceal it could this strange
man be speaking the truth

  i have learned you see continued
devere not only to speed up bodily
growth but to arrest it the drug causes
a state of suspended animation which lasts
long enough for a person to be sent down
the river to me

  devere watched hope rise in ki-gor
he was enjoying himself immensely it
was a rare pleasure to toy with this arro-
gant jungle man and to think kalido
brazen as he was had trembled with fear
when he suggested drugging the white
lord

  its an amusing fact the doctor added
but i didnt plan on receiving your wife
i was after you kalido bungled so that
she got the drug intended for you and
of course he had to carry the ceremony
out

- deveres words did not take immediate
effect on the white lord ki-gor could
not easily conceive of a scheme so utterly
inhuman a plot so vile and base almost
surpassed his understanding but staring
into the infinitely evil eyes of the doctor
he knew devere spoke the truth

  his anger exploded with sudden vio-
lence tore away the control with which
he had so carefully held himself in ki-
gors lips curled backover his white teeth
and from his throat came a chilling animal
	jungle

snarl he came to his feet in a quick cat-
like leap drove for devere with all the
blinding speed in his great body

but devere had planned well he was
not caught off guard by the jungle
mans attack the doctor pivoted on one
foot and crying slam the door slid into
the safety of the hallway the heavy door
crashed into place and the bar fell an in-
stant before ki-gor struck it deveres
laugh rang out at his complete success in
goading the white lord beyond endur-
ance

  at the hateful sound of the mans laugh-
ter ki-gor went berserk he plunged
against- the door the shattering drive of
his steel muscles catapulting him forward
time and again the door shuddered and
creaked under the shock of the giant white
mans power it was unbelievable a hu-
man could exert such force and seeing
the brute power of the man even devere
fell to silence a trickle of fear ran over
the guards standing in the hall armed
though they were they had no desire to
meet this raging jungle man

  the moment of uneasiness passed mus-
cle and bone no matter how strong the
will that controlled it was no match for
the heavy timbers ki-gor could not break
out he stood away from the door pant-
ing with his exertions his eyes narrow
with frustrated anger

  he was trapped helpless and the knowl-
edge knifed through the red mist of his
hate stabbed with agonizing pain into his
consciousness and as he stood there
beads of sweat gathering on his forehead
he was wracked with the thought that hel-
ene too suffered in the power of this
madman

  devere squinted through the narrow grill
in the door he spoke over his shoulder
to malu now bring nyga

  the black grunted with surprise at the
order then sped away eagerly an ex-
cited murmur rose from the guards they
had not anticipated this treat shortly
ki-gor heard the heavy sound of foot-
steps in the hall wondered what new plan
of torture the doctor had now conceived

  the door to the cell opened wide and
a great bulk stood there completely filling
the frame it was a huge dull-eyed black
man with tremendous sloping shoulders

stories

and long gorilla-like arms ki-gor looked
at the monster figure and into his mind
flashed the picture of the strange creature
he had hunted with ngeeso the other
had been a true gorilla whereas this one
was a native both misshapen beings ki-
gor realized were deveres handiwork
the doctor did not lie when he said he
could control growth

  bring him out nyga but dont kill
him commanded devere then speak-
ing to ki-gor he said its time for your
first treatment nyga likes to help me
with my patients maybe before long you
will be a fine obedient fellow just like
him

  nygas grossness revolted ki-gor this
moronic mountain of muscle was obviously
one of deveres more successful experi-
ments an elephantine jailor he used to beat
his prisoners into subjection this then
was the kind of creature into which the
doctorplanned to transform him

  go on nyga get him urged malu
anxious to see the white lord brought
to his knees

  the huge black spread his arms slowly
bringing them out wide from his body
his face registered no emotion no feel-
ing he leaned slightly forward hunching
his shoulders tilting his oddly shaped head
so that his chin sank in folds of fat and
muscle then with ponderous steps he
advanced on ki-gor

  the white lord waited hands at his
sides while the gigantic black moved cau-
tiously toward him it was clear what the
native meant to do his plan was to scoop
the white man into his arms smother the
strength from him carry him away as his
master ordered and to the consternation
of the watching guards ki-gor did not
cringe or curse or even move to all ap-
pearances he was going to submit without
a struggle

  devere watched the spectable and his
lips thinned in a sneer so the vaunted
white lord just as with other men knew
when he was beaten yet the thought was
hardly in the doctors mind when ki-gor
acted

a bolt of lightning was no more dif-
ficult to follow than the jungle mans
movement he whirled under the blacks
outstretched arms at the moment nyga
the monsters of voo doo isle	

thought to seize him he drove with all
his might into the natives vast belly sank
his shoulder deep in the bulging fat the
colossus grunted in pain heaved backward
a half step as nyga raised his hands to
drive them down on ki-gors head the
lithe white man slid to the right smashed
with the lower edge of his open hand twice
against the monsters side

  then nyga spurred to greater speed
by the pain of ki-gors blows caught the
jungle man with a sweeping blow of his
forearm the white lord careened against
the wall flung aside like a weightless leaf
he knew a straight blow from nygas
hands would shatter his skull or crush his
chest with ease the huge negros only
vulnerable point was his slowness

  ki-gor crouched the gray blaze of his
eyes never leaving his adversary then
he threw himself forward again his body
straining as he gained terrific momentum
in a bare three steps he lunged in a low
dive full against the side of nygas right
leg he struck at the knee attempting to
cripple the black by ripping the tendons
shattering the socket

  the white lord was successful-too
successful nyga gave a hoarse scream
as ki-gors more than two hundred pounds
of brawn blasted against his knee the
giant staggered and too clumsy to regain
his balance he toppled in a heap the
monster fell headlong on top of the jungle
man his crushing weight striking like a
collapsing roof

  ki-gors breath went out of him with
a rush he lay dazed by the shock pinned
helplessly under the massive black body
nyga angered at this first prisoner to
ever dare attack him grunted with hurt
rolled slowly to his hands and knees he
reached roughly for the white lord got
ponderously to his feet and jerking his
victim up with him raised him high over-
head

  devere saw that nyga meant to dash
the jungle man against the wall he
planned no such sudden end for the white
lord the doctor sped forward small
beside the brute he had molded

  down put him down he screamed
hurt him and i will have you lashed to
an ant hill you stupid pig

  nyga came to his senses under the lash
of words strangely he trembled before

the doctors wrath meekly lowered ki-
gor he stood like a whipped child
nervous and fearful his dim mind groping
to discover the wrong he had done this
jungle man had hurt him and then when
he tried to hurt him back devere grew
angry it was confusing but nyga re-
selved to even this score with ki-gor the
first time the doctor was not around with
the doctors abuse hate for ki-gor was
born in the giant yet now at deveres
bidding he carried the white lord out of
the cell and down the corridor as carefully
as his clumsy hands permitted

ki-gor was not unconscious when nyga
took him into the laboratory but he
was still stunned in any case the remorse-
less grip in which he was held made resis-
tance impossible as nyga placed him on
the table malu and the doctor quickly
buckled heavy leather straps across his
arms legs and chest to bind him firmly

  devere brusquely waved malu and nyga
out of the room he studied the white
lord busied himself with a number of
preliminary tests he was wholly ab-
sorbed in his work for a time seeming to
forget that ki-gors cold eyes never left
him he paused occasionally to jot down
notes in a small book when he was fin-
ished the absorbed look left his face the
professional air changed back to the mock-
ing taunting manner ki-gor already knew

well everything is as i hoped he
said leaning against the table youre
a splendid subject exactly what i needed
he cocked his head to the side rubbed
his chin thoughtfully

  you are the first white man ive
treated devere confided thats quite
an honor frankly i put a lot of faith in
you these blacks kalido sends me go
to pieces too quickly i believe youll
stand up a lot longer

   he reflected on his words watching to
see ki-gors reaction when no comment
was forthcoming from the white lord he
tried again

  uh between us from the physical
standpoint my experiments have been suc-
cessful take nyga for instance hes
not a bad job but ive had trouble with
the mental side the injections seem to
destroy the mind no matter what i try
devere straightened up rubbed his
	jungle

hands together from his leisurely man-
ner he was obviously enjoying himself it
was pleasant to have one of his own kind
to toy with

  oh well ill whip it one of these days
he continued if not with you then with
the next maybe in science you must
expect mistakes and failures before you
finally work out your problems

  ki-gor lay perfectly still his face ex-
pressionless he meant to give this insane
man none of the satisfaction of seeing him
cringe or beg but knowing that helene
lived and was in this madmans grasp ki-
gors mind was a ferment of desperation
he could not he must not let devere start
him on the road to death

  he must escape and yet though his
thoughts raced to find some solution ki-
gor knew there was none

the white lord had faced danger and
death many times and always there
had been some choice he could make al-
ways there had been a chance however
slim he could take this time he could
do nothing he was utterly powerless
no possible avenue of escape was open
to him

 devere walked away from him now
ki-gor watched the doctor go to a basin
carefully wash his hands he saw him
open a cabinet take out a glass object
fitted with a long needle it was the first
hypodermic needle ki-gor had ever seen
but he guessed its purpose

  devere inspected the needle closely
frowned something about it did not
please him from a large bottle of distilled
water he filled a small container then
he filled the needle to test it

  this cursed climate ruins everything
he suddenly sputtered

  angrily he put the water-filled needle
down on a small work table went back to
the cabinet and took out another hypo-
dermic the new one functioned to suit
him so he picked up a small black bottle
sealed with wax opened it filled the hy-
podermic from it with a clear liquid

  ki-gor felt his throat muscles constrict
as the doctor walked toward him for the
wrhite lord this was the end of hope
he watched deveres deliberately slow
steps and though he felt his brain must
burst with tension he gritted his teeth

stories

held himself in such iron control he showed
no single trace of emotion

  when devere was almost at the table
voices sounded in the hall outside the lab-
oratory

  one voice was especially loud and ex-
cited the doctor stopped listened in-
tently then a smile crept over his face
he regarded the hypodermic needle then
put it down carefully on the table beside
ki-gor turned and strode from the room

  this unexpected reprieve took the white
lord by surprise seconds passed before
he collected himself he took a deep
breath drew up every ounce of his strength
in a mighty effort to snap the leather bonds
that held him the great muscles of his
arms writhed and twisted then set hard
as he tried to jerk free blood swept into
his face and veins stood out on his fore-
head with the strain he twisted and
turned until his body ached with the agony
of his effort

  but the bonds held devere had built
this table for hysterical fear-crazed pa-
tients and he had done his job well ki-
gor with all his unleashed jungle power
knew he could never break free

  in the blackness of this knowledge the
white lord sank back on the table he
lay still and tense listening for the sound
that would tell him of deveres return
his keen ears picked up and magnified the
least sound as he waited

  then abruptly he caught his breath
what was that sound it came again
more distinctly now there was no mis-
taking it it was a monkeys nervous dis-
turbed chatter

  ki-gor raised his head as far as pos-
sible and down at the end of the room
he saw helenes pet monkey move from
behind a stack of boxes in the confusion
the day before when malu and devere
attacked ki-gor the monkey fled behind
the boxes and forgotten the frightened
little creature remained there

  because of his fear of devere boko
stayed in hiding as long as the doctor was
in the room with ki-gor now that he
knew helene was a prisoner the white
lord understood bokos fear of the doc-
tor apparently the man and his ser-
vant malu had mistreated the monkey
when they first captured helene ki-gor
had an idea they had tossed boko from
the monsters of voo doo isle	

the canoe when helene first arrived trying
to drown him

the pet scrambled down the boxes
hurried to ki-gor he peered hap-
pily into the white lords face chattered
with delight boko snuggled against his
master and obviously reassured was quiet
for a time but monkey-like he soon be-
came restless began to prowl around the
table

  the gleaming hypodermic needle lying
where devere had left it on the table be-
side ki-gor caught bokos eye he in-
spected the shining object gingerly picked
itup then as though sensing the strange
trinket was connected with the hated doc-
tor he hastily put it down retreated a
step curiosity soon got the best of him
and reaching out again boko retrieved the
object

  ki-gors eyes were on the monkey but
he hardly noted what the pet did the
white lords mind was turned inward
his thoughts racing back to the clearing by
silver river to the peaceful joy-filled days
with helene that he would know no more
he saw his flame-haired mate running to
greet him when he returned from the hunt
he saw her full lips pout as he teased
her he heard her soft warm voice as
she called his name all the countless
small things of their life together pressed
in upon him in torturing clearness he
even remembered her pleased expression
the morning he brought her boko a fright-
ened little waif whose mother had fallen
prey to a leopard

 ki-gors thoughts were abruptly
wrenched from the past he was staring
at boko the monkey turned the gleam-
ing hypodermic back and forth in his hand

  helenes pet was his one slim hope of
escape in thinking of helene he thought
also of the stratagem which might yet out-
wit devere how many times had he
watched boko retrieve small objects at
helens command if the monkey would
obey his orders there was still time per-
haps to escape the fate the madman planned
for him

  the white lord twisted his head stared
across the room to the small table where
devere had discarded the faulty hypoder-
mic it looked no different from the needle
boko held so far as ki-gor could see

some tiny evidence of rust some minor
defect caused devere to cast it aside the
doctor might never notice a switch of the
needles

  go boko go ki-gor hissed jerking
his head in the direction of the table

  the pet stopped playing glanced at ki-
gor in surprise he cocked his head
studied the jungle man curiously the
words were the same ones his mistress
used when they romped with sticks but
he had never heard the white lord use
them before his button-eyes brightened
as he decided ki-gor really meant he
wanted to play

  boko leaped from the table scampered
across the floor he stopped from time
to time to look back see whether ki-gor
meant him to go further in his excite-
ment the monkey held tightly to the deadly
hypodermic only once did he start to
put it down and then ki-gor his voice
suddenly anxious urged the pet to keep
moving and in obeying boko retained his
hold on the needle

  when the monkey reached the small
table on which lay the hypodermic filled
with harmless water ki-gor called up
up boko hesitated bewildered by ki-
gors inability to give him any hand sig-
nals any hints as to where he wanted him
to go twice more the white lord urged
the monkey to climb the table but the
creature became ever more confused

  ki-gor saw his last chance for life slip-
ping away he bit his lips casting des-
perately for a way to get boko to do what
he wanted and then of his own accord
boko did what ki-gor desired the ex-
cited monkey with a quick leap bounded
on the table top before the pet could
move on ki-gor acted

  pick it up he ordered

  boko twisted his head to look at the
white lord and reassured he was playing
the game all right glanced about him the
gleam of the second hypodermic caught
his attention he reached for it with the
same hand that held the deadly needle
the monkey hesitated a brief moment but
long enough for ki-gors heart to skip a
beat then swiftly the little creature put
down the needle he held snatched up the
other

  boko held the water-filled hypodermic
up triumphantly whirled about leaped to
	jungle

the floor came racing to the white lord
he chattered happily anticipating the
praise he would receive the monkey
bounded up beside ki-gor laid his find
proudly on the stable

  before ki - gor could say a word the
monkey stiffened ki-gor tensed too
deveres crisp cold voice sounded outside
the room- he was returning and with
him came a native a black who laughed
with delight at the doctors words ki-
gor listened and knew that kalido had
come to gloat

  the frightened monkey scampered into
hiding at the end of the laboratory as the
two men entered the door the wasuli
king moving with conscious arrogance
strode completely around the helpless
white lord his lips twisted in an ugly
smirk devere watched appreciatively

  so is this the lion of the jungle all
men fear asked kalido tauntingly is
this the great ki-gor

  the wasuli turned to devere pointed
a scornful finger at the white lord

  it will be good to see him change into
a blubbering obedient elephant i will
come often to see the blankness creep into
his eyes the rolls of stinking fat gather
on his body

anger boiled through ki-gors veins
churning in burning waves through
his brain seeing kalido unmasked he real-
ized for the first time the terrible hatred
the wasuli ruler had concealed this man
had allied himself with devere to gain
power and in his climb he had stopped at
nothing but ki-gor held himself in suc-
cessfully determined not to give kalido
the satisfaction of seeing his darts strike
home

  i was preparing to give him his first
shot devere said picking up the hypo-
dermic

  ki-gors mouth grew dry with tension
as he waited to see whether the doctor
would notice the shift of needles engaged
in talking devere hardly glanced at his
hand kalido asked how the drug would
affect the jungle man

  the shock will put him to sleep imme-
diately he will look like he is dying for
about two days then he will wake up

  devere paused thoughtfully studied ka-
lido closely

stories

  by the way you came early this trip

is anything wrong

  kalido did not reply immediately his
face sobered devere had guessed he had
some problem that worried him

   all goes well he said slowly except
that i worry about that skulking little
dango ngeeso ordinarily he would not
spend the night in my village but now he
continues to stay on

   devere shrugged his shoulders

  bah he said pygmies are always
hungry hes merely making the most of
the opportunity to eat and drink

  kalido frowned you dont know these
small ones they smell out every secret

i	dont like it with ngeeso nosing after
me sitting about the village watching al-
ways watching i want you to let me send
him down the river of silence

  the doctor shook his head against this
suggestion it was too soon to risk having
another prominent warrior fall sick

  leave him alone devere ordered he
cant know anything he cant learn any-
thing you are foolish to fear a dumb
childish pygmy

  and ki-gor listening to the conversa-
tion smiled inwardly if ngeeso who
heartily despised the wasuli was still
hanging around the village then he did in-
deed have his suspicions aroused the
information gave the white lord a great
satisfaction ngeeso would never rest
until he found what he sought and some
day though the white lord might not be
alive to see it the trail would lead to kalido
and devere

  but ki-gor put ngeeso from his mind
for the time being devere stopped talk-
ing caught the flesh of ki-gors right arm
with his fingers held the hypodermic needle
poised

  ki-gor knew the critical moment was
at hand craftily he played the part ex-
pected of him he lunged against the
leather bonds fought desperately to tear
loose his jaw was set and grim his eyes
flaming with hate and devere with
mocking detachment jabbed the needle
home stood calmly waiting for the re-
action

  the white lord fought on for a time
long enough for devere to put the needle
aside still without more than a glance
then the jungle man fell back on the
the monsters of voo doo isle	

table lay limp and motionless his eyes
closed he was to all intents unconscious
his breathing slowed and his mouth gaped
open

  hes a valuable specimen said the
doctor at last his words breaking the quiet
exceptionaly strong the average man
goes out much more quickly

  kalido glared at the unmoving white
lord he would never feel easy until
the jungle man was a moronic giant stum-
bling obediently to carry out deveres
orders

  well see how strong he is when you
put him in the pit with the others said
the wasuli vengefully a few of those
crazy ones will handle him

  ah but he isnt going to the pit re-
torted the doctor im taking no chances
with ki-gor he will stay in a special
cell and nyga will watch him im tak-
ing no chances on my prize getting hurt or
escaping

  he watched kalidos face fall and smil-
ing he turned and strode to the door
nyga he called the huge man-beast
came with heavy footsteps lumbering into
the room shifting uneasily on his great
legs as devere untied ki-gor

viii

though his eyes were closed ki-
gor followed every move made in the
room through his keen sense of smell and
hearing he knew when devere walked
toward him that he would be free of his
bonds in another minute mentally he
debated the course he should take his
every instinct urged him to leap on the
doctor batter the crazed inhuman man to
a pulp every heritage of the jungle told
him to rip his tormentor to pieces

  but he controlled himself his personal
meeting with devere must wait yet a while
he must think first of helene and tembu
george and in order to save them he
needed more of a chance to escape than
at present presented itself

  after all nyga with his resistless
strength blocked the door nearby stood
kalido a long wasuli knife sheathed at
his waist a blade he would be only too
eager to bring into play ki-gor had no
fear of them but he realized they might
cut off his escape delay him until help

came if he failed there would be no
second chance

  so ki-gor lay limp unresisting when
devere had nyga picked him and carry
him from the room with his unerring
sense of direction the white lord guessed
in advance he was being taken back to the
same cell he heard the door creak open
showed no reaction as nyga clumsily
carried him into the room dumped him
unceremoniously on the cold floor when
the door slammed shut he heard devere
order the hulking brute to stay there and
stand guard then deveres footsteps re-
ceded into the distance

  ki-gor remained quiet a long while
his return to this room was something he
had not counted on his spirits sank his
predicament was almost as bad as before
he would never be able to break out of
this cell and eventually devere would guess
his deception

  then a strange fact broke on his con-
sciousness it was a thing a civilized man
would never have noticed for it had to
do with nygas heavy scent emotions
of fear and anger cause a subtle shift in
the scent of a man or an animal and ki-
gor became aware that the huge black
was boiling with fury

  the white lord opened his eyes to tiny
slits and looking at the small panel in the
door he saw nygas enraged face he
realized with a start that he was the ob-
ject of the brutes hate nyga had not
forgotten his battle with ki-gor in this
room and now with his feared master out
of sight he lusted for an opportunity to
deal with the white man who had dared to
hurt him

  an idea took form in ki-gors mind
he had tried once to smash the door and
had failed the barrier was too formid-
able for his muscles to shatter but the
irresistible power of the behemoth who
glared at him could make kindling of those
timbers if he could tantalize nyga into
breaking into the room he might be able
to elude the unwieldy black and break
free it must be done quickly though
before the noise brought devere and his
followers

  ki-gor sprang up dashed forward snar-
ling smashed his hand into nygas dull
features taken completely offguard the
giant grunted with pain he blinked his
	jungle

eyes slow to grasp the fact that the hated
white man had come alive was actually
seeking trouble then he bellowed with
rage

  nyga stood back from the door his
loose mouth twitched began to dribbe sa-
liva his eyes rolled wildly completely
forgotten was devere gone any fear of
the penalty the doctor would assess if ki-
gor were injured nyga was obsessed
with the desire to kill he had suffered
at this pygmys hands before and now this
upstart dared challenge him again

  nyga pulled awkwardly at the door
devere had locked it in addition to drop-
ping the large crossbar the maddened
brute wasted no time trying to puzzle a
means to open it he backed away took
a huge step forward threw all his immense
weight against the barrier it crackled
and sagged nyga growled at the ob-
stacle wheeled back lunged again

  the door blasted from its hinges ripped
apart under the monsters charge and
nyga propelled by the ferocity of his
own attack half-stumbled half-fell into
the cell as broken wood clattered against
the walls and floor he bellowed again
his inhuman bloodcurdling tones reverber-
ating in the room

  ki-gor crouched against the back wall
grim and tense as the leviathan burst
through the timbers the giant recovered
his balance heaved up to his full height
nygas shoulder was smeared with blood
where the skin had ripped away when he
struck the door but he gave it no notice
his full attention was centered on the white
lord his inflamed eyes in their puffy
sockets were those of a crazed beast his
great sagging belly worked with excite-
ment	

  nyga spraddled his huge legs to steady
himself his ham-like hands were knotted
into immense clubs he was visibly gather-
ing himself to drive at his cornered quarry
disable him with one charge yet ki-gor
waited motionless his arms pressed back
on the wall his weaponless hands wide-
spread against the wood

narrowly ki-gor watched his
kill-crazed opponent drawing on an
instinct born of countless battles to tell
him when and how to act then as the
first slight shift of the giants shoulder told

stories

him nyga was closing it the jungle man
moved with lightning speed with his
hand he shoved away from the wall gain-
ing an impetus which had him running
full speed by his second step

  the white lord darted toward the left
at the instant nyga plunged forward
he raced as though he meant to skirt past
the giant the monster saw his intent
shifted with immense effort the direction
of his charge straining to reach the white
man

  he hurled his vast bulk to pin ki-gor
against the side wall

  but again the jungle man outwitted
nyga his perfectly coordinated body
was keyed to carry through this stratagem
the only possible device which could take
him past the black in these crowded
quarters

  ki-gor wheeled almost in full stride
and now every atom of strength in his
steel-muscled legs flared into use he
reversed himself racing back toward the
wall he had just left the unwieldy giant
tried to shift his course for the second
time tried to follow the jungle man but
his awkward clumsy legs could not match
the smaller mans maneuver

  that brief interval in which nyga was
off balance unable to wheel to block him
was ki-gors objective the lithe white
lord swerved toward the right hand wall
and driving with terrific speed he shot past
the huge black darted through the shat-
tered door into the hall turning the op-
posite way from the laboratory he ran
full tilt toward the end of the hall where
he saw the gleam of sunlight

  he stopped at the door puzzled as to
how to find helene and tembu george he
glanced outside saw only one native close
at hand the mans long knife and spear
told that he was a guard the black
stood lazily watching something outside
ki-gors line of vision

  the white lord strolled boldly into the
open moved with slow relaxed steps
toward the guard he gambled on his
leisurely pace exciting no suspicion at
least not until he was close on the black
his nerves tingled as step by step he ap-
proached the man knowing he might turn
at any time send the spear whipping to
cut him down he was twelve steps from
the wasuli when the fellow threw him a
the monsters of voo doo isle	

casual glance ten steps when the guards

eyes suddenly sharpened

  ki-gor thought fast

  where is my friend the doctor he
asked

  the guard hesitated he knew this white
man should not be here and yet ki-gor
walked with the air of an honored guest
the white lord lounged two steps nearer
before the black definitely decided some-
thing was wrong

  ki-gor saw the mans stomach muscles
tighten his spear arm start its upward
swing then gone was his casual air
he could stall the black no longer in the
space of two more breaths the spear would
be hurtling at him his relaxed leg mus-
cles corded and flexed and with a leopards
sudden bursting drive he raced at the
wasuli

stop i kill cried the native jerking
his spear to shoulder height for the cast

  but he reckoned not with the white
lords incredible speed the jungle man
catapulted at him steel-hard fingers closed
about his throat throttling off his final
words

  the black tried to jab downward with
the spear but too quickly ki-gor was
under the blow and against the native the
white lord toppled the native backward
fell astride him as the force of the jolt
ripped the spear from the warriors grasp

  ki-gor was a savage merciless fighting
machine now he was committed to win
free or die there was no turning back
no alternative and knowing this he shed
the skin-deep veneer of civilization ac-
quired from helene fought with the ter-
rible explosive fury of a jungle killer

  his fingers dug into the natives throat
wrenched deep as though to choke the
life from him the blacks eyes bugged
out his dark face puffed and twisted and
he bucked in futile agonized desperation
then as ki-gor saw the life draining from
the man he released his grip slightly al-
lowed the wasuli to gasp a breath into his
aching lungs

quick dango he snarled where
is the white girl speak or you die

  terror was in the natives eyes the
fight was gone from him his torn throat
muscles worked spasmodically as he
strained to speak his words were a faint
broken whisper

  there he said pointing feebly toward
the building which housed the pit

  ki-gor lifted the natives head a short
distance above the hard-packed ground
then dashed it back the wasuli went
limp the blow knocking him unconscious
ki-gor pulled the mans long curved knife
from its sheath snatched up the spear the
wasuli would give no alarm for a long
time

  the white lord started to run to the
building pointed out by the wasuli but
a low murderous outburst behind him
stayed his footsteps he whirled saw
nyga plow into view ki-gor balanced
the heavy spear gained the feel of the
weapon his arm swung back steadied
as he awaited the proper moment then
drove forward in the lashing throw of the
dread masai spearmen

no warrior in the entire congo could
match the power the effortless skill
of his throw and he threw now to kill
to bring down this mountain of flesh
the spear cleft the air cleanly sunlight
gleamed once on its bright point and then
with a jolting thud it hit its mark

  nyga stumbled slowed to a walk
stopped a strange look twisted his dis-
torted features he made an odd gurgling
sound and rivulets of blood started from
his gaping mouth

  the spear stood straight out from the
center of his chest only half the shaft
was in view the point had driven com-
pletely through his massive trunk pro-
truded redly from his back nyga stared
down at the shaft and the strength went
out of his legs the monstrous figure slid
to his knees

  ki-gor waited no longer without a
backward glance he went with long quick
strides toward helenes prison the long
knife shone in his hand his narrowed
eyes were the eyes of a stalking lion hyp-
notic in their searing intensity his nostrils
flared slightly at every breath

  this was the ki-gor of native legend
this man who went forward against un-
known odds one man unafraid against
many this was the white lord of the
jungle greatest warrior of the congo
whose very name struck terror into his
enemies aroused courage and strength in
his friends
	jungle

  he came on silent feet to the entrance
he listened placing the approximate loca-
tions of the two guards who chatted in-
side the door then quietly he caught
hold of the door it moved easily as he
tried it so with a sudden tug he tore it
open

  ki-gor was across the threshold in a
leap one startled guard looked up in
time to see the blurred sweep of the white
lords blade it was the last sight of his
life the stroke severed his neck sent him
careening against his fellow in a pulsing
geyser of blood

  the second guard swept up his spear
to chop down this knife-wielding appari-
tion but the jerking corpse of his fellow
struck him fouled his spear the white
lord bounded at him before he could re-
cover ki-gors knife burned the air like
a jagged bolt of lightning stabbed thrice
into the mans chest and belly

  ki-gor ripped the spear from the guard
and ran forward he glanced about him as
he ran his mouth tightening at this fur-
ther evidence of deveres cruelty he was
near the edge of the pit before the other
guards grasped the meaning of his pres-
ence realized he had cut down the two
men at the door

  aaaaiiii cried one it is ki-gor
come to claim his mate and there was
a note of terror in his voice

   then a harsh voice rose above the others
a voice of authority it was the head guard
and his words struck the wavering blacks
with the effect of a lash

   kill he cried kill or be killed stop
him or no man here will see another sun

  they came on then slowly at first and
then with the growing bravery of a pack
they came racing along the narrow ledge
from their posts around the pit there was
no time for ki-gor to pick out helenes
figure from the milling screaming mob
below but he knew she was there and
tembu george with her

  his foot caught against a rough surface
he tripped fell to his knees as he fell he
saw what caused him to stumble it was
the ladder which the guards used to climb in
and out of the pit without wasting a
moment the quick-witted jungle man
dropped his spear and knife caught the
ladder and with a powerful tug shoved it
out and down

stories

  a way of escape lay open for the prison-
ers below if only he could hold back the
guards the wasuli converged on him in
two groups coming from opposite sides of
the building five in one bunch three in the
other

ki-gor snatched up his weapons
turned to face the three men who
came from the left his great-thewed legs
braced his right arm went back in a short
quick arc carrying the spear then with a
catapults driving power he cast the long
wasuli spear it thrummed a death song as
it cleft the air at terrific speed

  a running guard screamed as the shaft
lanced through his stomach he leaned
crazily as he ran near the runways edge
then slid and fell in a twisting heap the
man directly behind him moved too fast to
stop so he leaped high to clear the fallen
guard but the spear ki-gor had thrown
reared up from the dying wasulis belly
the second natives leg struck the shaft and
he crashed on his face rolled once and
pitched headlong into the pit

  ki-gors voice rose in the dread war-
cry of the masai the chilling blood cry
which the fierce warriors utter when they
close with their enemies he was hurtling
toward the one remaining native straining
to reach him before the man loosed his
spear the wasuli though had no inten-
tion of letting ki-gor close with him and
his arm cocked in mid-stride for the cast

  ki-gors slitted eyes fastened on the
mans spear arm while desperation urged
him to his greatest effort he knew he could
not reach the wasuli in time but still he
drove on certain death faced him if he
halted and if he must die he intended to
take the guard with him

  and then in the rushing span of a pulse
beat the white lord made the one try
that could save him too fast for the eye
to follow his red stained knife whipped
up then it sang toward the native ki-gor
threw the knife with tremendous speed
threw almost instinctively and the whirring
blade cleft the air in its race to reach the
wasuli before he cast his spear

  the blade hammered into the blacks
chest even as he swung with the spear
throw as he delivered the final thrust of
power into the shaft ki-gor had struck
too late to halt the native but the knifes
the monsters of voo doo isle



stabbing drive and the searing pain it
sent flaring through the wasuli achieved
the jungle mans purpose twisting under
ki-gors blow the warrior bobbled his aim
the spear was diverted enough to send it
blasting past ki-gors right shoulder

  ki-gor slammed against the grey-faced
guard gave a surging push writh his shoul-
ders and the wasuli reeled off the edge o
the walk fell screaming into the pit the
white lord did not break his stride until
he reached the dropped weapons of the
first guard he had cut down the man lay
on his side with ki-gors spear driven
through his stomach his eyes glazed  in
death

  with feline grace the white lord picked
up the spear and knife spun to face the
five remaining guards his eyes were a
blaze of gray fire his lips a thin firm
line as he stood poised on the pits edge
his bronzed body naked but for a breech-
clout was tight-strung as a drawn arrow
as he gauged the grim warriors weighed
his next move

  far below the milling prisoners looked
up and saw the crouching white figure for
the first time since their imprisonment
they saw a man face deveres cruel guards
without fear and a strange thing hap-
pened to those brutalized men to those
near-beasts with dim fading memories of
a time when they too were free and un-
afraid

  silence fell over the pit the snarls and
half-mad screams of the prisoners dropped
away as though at a signal every eye
fastened on the white lord then one man
said the word another took it up it swept
-that magic word-over the watching
mass like the crackle of flame over parched
veldt

  ki-gor ki-gor ki-gor

  again and again they said it and the
memories of the green jungle of their home
kraals of the shadowed paths where men
walked erect grew and swelled strong and
life-like in their tortured minds

  louder and louder swelled the cry
louder until the chant rose dcafeningly
louder until the sound roiled like thunder

  and high above them ki-gor heard the
rising surge of theirvoices he heard them
call his name over and over and through
him flamed a strength that was more than
his own the running guards heard the

  shattering chant and in their ears it was
magnified even more for there was a terri-
ble faith and hope and certainty in the
thunder of those voices

sensitive as a jungle creature ki-
gor watched the guards felt the invol-
untary fear which the sound loosed in them
he saw them falter as they passed the
point where he had flung down the ladder
the battering emotion of the prisoners dis-
tracted them filled them with a rush of
misgivings

  and ki-gor in that moment launched his
spear with blasting power at the tight pack
of guards he threw the spear and almost
before it left his hand he was racing after
it pounding toward the center of the
wasuli

  they saw him flash into action and with
cries that went unheard in the tumult two
men cast their spears but the white lord
was a twisting turning target as he sped
toward them ki-gors spear drove full
into a guards mouth ripped through to
tear away part of the next mans shoulder

  then ki-gor was close against the first
man his knife whistling as he parried the
guards spear thrust chopped through the
shaft with a bone-shattering blow the
man swung with the broken shaft but the
dancing shifting white lord melted be-
fore the attack swung back and under to
slash a deep wound across the warriors
belly

  fear and pain whipped the guard to
greater effort and despite his gashed
stomach he swung the length of wood with
desperate quickness the shaft caught ki-
gor across the chest and he staggered back
under the terrible blow he fought to keep
his feet but the breath was gone from his
lungs his eyes blurred with dizzy nausea
his legs buckled and he fell to his knees

  the guard tried to finish the white
lord raised the spear shaft to strike again
but the wash of blood from his wound
swept away his strength he trembled in
sudden agony and collapsed through a
mist ki-gor saw the man fall knew the
other blacks would be on him in a second
he reared to his feet drunkenly held erect
through sheer will

  the wasuli dashed at him their grim
faces lighting with the knowledge he was
hurt ki-gor raised his long knife awk-
	jungle

  wardly struggling to clear the dizziness
from his head to see the men clearly he
swayed heavily feet braced wide apart
knowing full well they would be on him
before his strength returned

  then slashing through the tumult came
a fierce nerve-tingling war cry it was a
voice of wrath and fury that rang above
all else and dimly behind the guard ki-
gor saw a huge black figure catapult from
the top rung of the ladder mount the edge
of the pit almost in the same motion the
giant black sent his spear at the wasuli
nearest ki-gor the spear caught the man
in the back lifted him from his feet threw
him completely past the white lord

  the other wasuli wheeled at the abrupt
emergence of this new enemy he turned
in time to see tembu george greatest of
all the masai bound toward him the
wasuli gaped at this fierce apparition from
the pit hesitated a moment too long and
the masai chieftains knife chopped half
his skull away

  ki-gors eyes were clearing now and he
saw helene swing over the edge of the
pit then behind her in a steady stream
came the prisoners the one wasuli guard
remaining alive the man wounded in the
shoulder by ki-gors spear lay moaning
on the ground when the grotesque figures
began clambering into view with a scream
of terror he heaved to his feet started to
run toward the door a snarling mass
closed around him bore him down battered
him into silence

  tembu george started for ki-gor but
hearing helenes glad cry he stood aside
the red-haired girl ran to her mate anx-
ious as she suddenly saw the red welt
across his chest her arms went around
him she pressed her face close against him

  oh ki-gor i never thought id see
you again she began then halted but
youre hurt theyve hurt you

  he ran his hand over her soft hair let
it rest on the curve of her shoulder

  im all right they knocked the wind
from me and loosened a few bones he
said laughing to reassure her

  but his eyes were not laughing as they
flicked over her seeking the evidence he
dreaded to find tembu george watched
him knew what he sought

  dont worry about us ki-gor the
masai chieftain said devere didnt touch

stories

  us and i was able to bluff those poor fel-
lows in the pit

  more and more prisoners crowded out
of the pit they milled about excitedly
always watching ki-gor

  we must start moving the white
lord told helene and tembu george
deveres heard this noise and gathered
his guards by now it wont be easy to
get away from here

ki-gor took a deep breath shook his
shoulders loose his tremendous
inner vitality already had restored his
strength the blow he took dazed him but
his rock-like chest muscles had cushioned
the shock which would have crushed an
average man years of extreme physical ac-
tivity paid off now in his bodys quick
return to normal

  with a smile tembu george recovered
two spears from the ground handed one
to ki-gor after days of strain and horror
in the pit the masai chieftain stood with
weapons in his hands a strong friend to
fight beside him and he was content he
knew not how many wasuli stood between
him and freedom and he did not care
death in battle holds no fear for a masai
nor do warriors of the wasuli tribe

  stay close behind us helene ki-gor
said pressing a knife into her hand

  we go cried tembu george and
there was a fierce joy in his voice

  walking side by side tembu george
and ki-gor forced a way through to the
door with helene staying close at their
heels as they stepped outside the mass
of prisoners boiled out after them pushing
about them in an irregular mob this ac-
tion saved the trios lives

  a wave of wasuli led by devere and
kalido swept toward the building whsn
they saw ki-gor and his slim mate they
gave a cry and loosed their spears the
mob of prisoners which rushed from the
door screened the j ungle couple and tembu
george

  the spears struck with deadly effect
wounding and killing many in the crowd
the wasuli shouted with triumph as they
saw the unarmed prisoners fall and they
swept forward with their knives sure in
the knowledge they could beat these down-
trodden brutes back into the pit

  but ki-gor leaped to the fore and
the monsters of voo doo isle	

with the maddened rush of bulls the pris-
oners followed him their fear of the
guards was gone replaced by a burning
desire to kill with only their bare hands
for fighting the strange pack drove over
their fallen comrades raced at the wasuli

  the brutes struck the line of warriors
and such was the shock of their clawing
tearing charge that the wasuli reeled back
before it in sheer animal savagery they
threw themselves on the guards motivated
by a hate born of the endless terror to
which devere and his men had subjected
them and though they died they dragged
wasuli with them into death

  yet flesh cannot stand against steel and
urged on by devere and kalido the wasuli
closed their ranks and stood firm the bat-
tle swirled and eddied and then the thin-
ning prisoners began to fall back the
guards knives were too much and though
ki-gor and tembu george cut a swath
of death about them they too had to retreat
with the others or be surrounded-

  abruptly the prisoners gave up the
unequal struggle they broke and ran in
every direction each one striving now to
make good his own escape when this hap-
pened tembu george stopped retreating
his manner showing he meant to fight and
die where he was

  there is still a chance helene said
pointing to the building close by where
devere had forced her to view the worst
of his monsters quick lets go in there

  they reached the door dashed inside
ki-gor and tembu george stopped in their
tracks stared about them unbelievingly

  open the doors let them out com-
manded helene

hurriedly the two men went down
the long corridor raising the bars
which held shut each cell door flinging
every door wide they understood what
helene planned some of the great beasts
were too huge and sluggish to move but
most of them were excited by cries outside
the building and paced about their cells
a few ventured from their cells before ki-
gor and tembu george had finished open-
ing all the doors

  two of the beasts began to fight then
others joined in and quickly the building
rocked under the impact of struggling
giants natives who had tried to follow the

trio into the building took one glance and
fled as the monsters careened closer to
them tembu george opened the back door
led the way into the open air

  but as he stepped from the building
he cried a warning to his companions
devere kalido and a band of wasuli stood
waiting stung by the instant contempt on
tembu georges face kalidos lips twisted
in hate and he dove at the masai chieftain

  tembu george gave half a step as he
parried the knife thrust then with cat-like
agility he bent slightly and rocking forward
drove his blade through kalidos throat
it happened so quickly not one of kalidos
men had a chance to save him

  ki-gor and helene were beside tembu
george then and the three stood with their
backs against the rough logs ready for the
rush of the wasuli kalidos body lay on
the ground before them his blood spilling
a crimson ring on the dark earth

  come in dangoes taunted tembu
george so you may follow your sneaking
king

  deveres face was livid with rage these
three had cost him trouble enough with
a third of his guards dead his experiments
ruined he swung the flat of the wasuli
knife he held on the guards shoulders

  get them you cowards he screamed

  his words were drowned in the rum-
bling roar of the hideous giant that plunged
from the building stood blinking in the
sunlight the creature twisted his bulbous
head as the scent of blood struck him he
saw the wasuli warriors and made for
them the men turned and ran and even
devere ran back a few steps then as the
monster went by ki-gor leaped at the
doctor before the man gathered his wits

  too late devere realized he must face
the white lord alone his face tightened
and his mouth twitched for a moment it
seemed he would try to run away then
goaded by desperation he threw caution
to the winds went to meet ki-gor swing-
ing his long wasuli knife like a saber
twice ki-gor parried the doctors blows
without trying to attack then as he did
the same thing again tembu george
frowned but when on the fourth clash of
the blade ki-gor twisted his hand sent
deveres knife singing through the air the
masai leader smiled appreciatively

  cut him to ribbons tembu george
	jungle

urged feeling no mercy for the cruel white
man

  devere paled realizing how close to
death he was ki-gors features were
utterly expressionless as he stood holding
the razor-sharp blade an inch from the
doctors throat suddenly ki-gor pitched
the knife away

  deveres eyes gleamed the fool thought
to beat him with his fists devere lashed
out swiftly

  ki-gor shifted with lightning speed and
his open palm smashed full in the doctors
face the man pitched backward his lips
split and torn as he jumped to his feet
he tried to kick the jungle man in the groin
again he failed and again that rock-like
hand exploded in his face ki-gor smashed
and battered devere back and forth over
the blood-spattered ground until the doctor
fell flat began to crawl whimpering

  there was the splintering crash of wood
and another great beast heaved wild-eyed
and bellowing from the building ki-gor
turned instantly from devere to watch the
beast make certain helene was safe de-
vere on the other hand crawled rapidly
to where his knife had fallen

  ki-gor stood with his back to the doctor
tembu george and helene were stiffened
against the building watching the giant
devere came painfully to his feet started
to run at the white lord

deveres action caught the monsters
attention with another roar the
beast charged the only thing in its vision
that moved it bore down on devere with
express train speed the giants huge
clawing hands snatched up the doctor
literally twisted him in half tossed the
broken body fifty feet away then the
monster ran forward to stamp the last
remnant of the man into the earth

  helene gasped at the sickening sight and
even tembu george turned away ki-gor
recovered his knife lying a few feet away
and motioning to the two he led the way
toward the jungle at first it appeared
theywould go unobserved

  but deveres order to capture ki-gor
had been strict and his precautions thor-
ough a band of guards was thrown around
the edge of the jungle with the command
to hold their posts until the white lord
was caught

stories

   ki-gor was almost on top of the hiding

 men before he discovered them they
 swarmed from ambush and as the trio
 turned back they came racing after them

   keep going ki-gor cried to helene
 and tembu george and he swung around
 to delay the wasuli as long as he could

  we go only with you answered
 helene and she pivoted with tembu
 george to stand beside her mate

   the wasuli came leaping from the jun-
 gle knowing there wras no further retreat
 for their quarry their knives gleamed in
 the sunlight as they brandished them
 wildly they came in a rush each one
 eager to be in at the kill and their voices
 rang in the cruel warcry of the wasuli

   then only a few paces from the jungle
 the running warriors began to tumble and
 fall their cries died gurgling in their
 throats

   ki-gor stared at the strange mystifying
 scene tembu georges eyes widened and
 his mouth dropped open where a minute
 before men ran triumphantly to the kill
 only an irregular line of corpses lay

   ho a good friend comes the fa-
 miliar voice rang from the forest

   ki-gor and helene looked at each other
 and a smile began to play at the corner of
 their mouths tembu george snapped his
 mouth closed erased all surprise from his
 face

   a small figure stepped from behind a
 tree strode importantly toward them
 behind the little man pygmies began to
 swarm from cover ngeeso patted his
 blowgun his eyes gleaming brightly

   so once more ki-gor we pull this
 great elephant out of trouble ngeeso
 said frowning disapprovingly at tembu
 george he pursed his lips shook his
 head vigorously had it not been for
 helene i would never have wasted my time
 trailing kalido

   tembu george for once made no reply
 to the little mans good natured taunts
 he winked at ki-gor this time ngeeso
 had earned the right to crow and thankful
 as well as amused tembu george did not
 mean to spoil the little chieftains fun

   ki-gor slipped his arm around helene
and smiling they walked away leaving
 ngeeso to admonish his great friend

os	starr

       the eater of souls began by stealth but soon the bush shook
       to the endless chilling roar of the gimshais juju-lion  as
       it brought death-and worse than death--to all in the jungle

tony wayne sensed a sudden	and dead things sweeping his gaze from

menace in the jungle air he could	the verandah of his bungalow his eyes

find no reason for the feeling why	traveled over the rows of grass huts which

he should be so abruptly conscious of death	stood in the clearing he saw nothing but

wayne knew he had walked into a death trap
	jungie

a few naked black children playing among
the huts saw nothing disturbing among the
trees and thick-growing vegetation of the
almost impenetrable jungle that hemmed
the clearing

  that was in the moment before nglana
and his crew of workmen came filing out
of the short jungle road that led from the
gold pits

  wayne stiffened slightly his rule was
that none should leave the pits during
working hours because of it the black
men-save nglana-had been resentful
for it had been their habit to cease work
any time to hunt or loaf mooli a leader
among them had deserted camp only a few
days before others whispered of similar
intentions

  wayne stepped from the bungalow
arms folded he faced the men in the cen-
ter of the native compound

  why have you left your pit he asked
sharply

  oddly the men appeared more afraid
than resentful even nglana the tall zulu
whose rare sense of responsibility made
him so invaluable to wayne was visibly
disturbed fear made the white of his
eyes vivid in the tight-set ebony of his
face

  gimshai the eater of souls has come
into our pit nglana said bwana we
are afraid he will snatch our souls one by
one as we work there

  foolish old womans talk replied
wayne in disgust nglana i never
believed a brave man as thou-

  the smell of death is there in the pit
bwana- has been there for two suns
growling stronger as time has passed now
we have doubts no longer nglanas nos-
trils dilated as he sniffed wah the wind
even brings a trace of the vile smell all the
way to our kraal

  wayne became aware of it finally-the
faint odor of the dead he realized it was
this he had noted in the air a moment be-
fore but had not recognized it his sun-
browned face hardened his voice became
curt

   let us return to the pit he said

  aaiiee a wail of fright rose from the
black workers they huddled sullenly
we will not return there to lose our lives
gimshai hath returned to mata-gara

s tories

again as it was said he would we must
flee-

  i will return to the pit with you
bwana spoke nglana with simple dig-
nity

  wayne stared at him he knew nglanas
fear was great as that of his companions
yet the zulu was willing to return to the
pit with him

  you are my friend and let none ever
step on your shadow wayne said and
led the way out of the kraal and into the
dank shadowy roadway that led to the
close-by gold pit with every step the
stench became heavier more nauseating
nglana drew close to the white man it
was as if he felt wayne could protect him
by his nearness

the gold pit was shallow hollow in the
jungle floor the death-reek was in-
tense yet wayne saw nothing unusual in
the diggings

  wait here nglana he said at last
i will go down and look

  nervousness tightened nglanas thick
lips it seemed that he intended to stop or
at least warn the white man against his
reckless plan he said nothing standing
motionless tense while he watched wayne
descend

  wayne moved slowly threading noise-
lessly among the shapeless boulders that
were strewn about the pit then abruptly
he stopped eyes narrowing the answer
to the vile odor was before him-the hor-
ribly-mangled corpse of a black native ly-
ing wedged behind one of the large boul-
ders

  the jungle is not kind to the dead the
two-day-old corpse was already in an ad-
vanced stage of putrefaction studying the
body a moment he finally returned to the
pits rim and rejoined the apprehensive
nglana

  there is no evil jungle spirit in the
pit he said reassuringly i have seen the
truth

  but the stench bwana-

  come with me and i will show you
wayne told him there is no danger

  nglana hesitated the zulu was puz-
zled unsure when he followed the white
man down into the pit at last his fingers
were tight and ready on the handle of his
half-drawn throwing knife
death-plague

  he fell back a step his face shocked
and bleak as wayne pointed out the rot-
ting corpse to him

  mooli he cried it is the worker we
thought had deserted us a few suns past
walt nodded wayne it is what re-
mains of mooli he was clawed and struck
by a lion and he fell down into this pit
his body lay hidden from your sight
lodged behind this great stone

  clawed by a lion    nglanas voice
was a horrified gasp instinctively he ges-
tured in tribal counter-magic gimshai
and his cursed lion-monster hath returned
then after all

  you speak child-chatter scoffed
wayne moolis death was an accident
frequent to this lion-country of mata-
gara a man is foolish who wanders this
bush alone at night

  i have heard stories bwana fear-
filled excitement harshened nglanas
tones gimshai has returned to bring ter-
ror upon mata-gara as in the past the
eater of souls begins-as this-by stealth
yet soon this bush will shake to the endless
roaring of gimshais juju-lion it will
bring death-and yet worse than death-
on all of us

  silence nglana ordered wayne in
a sharp voice i never thought you would
believe the wild stories fools tell at cooking
fires go now to the bungalow return
with your men we must bury mooli
nglana eyed him tensely he said no
more but turned away to fetch the others

  they returned with him in a numbed
silence they tended to the putrifying
corpse and buried it in the jungle growths
not far from the pit and the hot moist
breeze that had carried the stench of
death as far as the bungalow clearing now
washed the odor away the air became
clear of the dead only the familiar smells
of the jungle remained

ayne talked to the men then-
long and earnestly-until they saw
the wisdom of his reasoning and returned
to their labors in the gold pit being
clawed to death by a lion as he had said
earlier was not an uncommon occurrence
in mata-gara

  but wayne wasnt entirely convinced
himself when he returned to his bungalow

a-jungle stories-spring

of mata-gara	

he had made a close examination of the
claw marks that had torn the corpse and
it was obvious mooli had been struck
down by some tremendous beast the claw
spread had been fully three times that of
the largest lion he had ever seen   

  tony wayne had lived most of his
thirty-five years in africa he had made
and lost more than one fortune in his
career of prospecting and mining in the
primitive congo areas and it was in a
coast town that he heard about the fabu-
lous mata-gara claims he had a glimpse
of the government record regarding the
mines and was intrigued when it was said
the mines couldnt be worked and were up
for sale at a pittance someone else was
bidding on the mines so he borrowed
money and beat out this competitor

  youre sunk tony a friend told him
afterward machinery cant even be flown
into that wild region and youll have to
rely on natives to dig for you worse its
juju country they got a very potent
brand of black magic there thats made
other owners fail itll stop you too

  well see grinned wayne i know
my jungle mister if the golds there ill
get it out  

  it wasnt until he got to leopoldville on
the first leg of his journey to mata-gara
that he got his first concrete information
about what might be in store for him he
ran into duval there duval was a blocky
little frenchman he knew from way back

  sacre nom de nom gasped duval
when he learned where wayne was headed
youre in for hell the mines are in bad
shape the blacks are surly and theres
that queer juju to fight against wayne
youd be better off if you sold those hold-
ings for whatever you can get

  you seem to know a lot about it du-
val

  i do davis the last owner hired me to
work for him i know the kind of hell
thats happened there

  wayne stared what dyou mean-
hell

  juju hissed the frenchman na-
tives there say gimshai the eater of
souls protects that bush from all white
men gimshai and his big juju lion is sup-
posed to finish off any white that comes
there things shaped up for davis till the
juju lion began its infernal bellowing it
so	jungle

licked davis like it licked others before
him-and like its going to lick you nom
du diable you should wash your hands
of those mines-and quick

  but somebodys going to come along
and beat those jungle ghosts said wayne
doggedly i want to be sure that some-
body is me   

  they did a lot of talking that night a
lot of drinking too before the evening was
over and that was close to dawn wayne
had gotten duvals promise to go along
with him he offered duval a big share
in the mines-but only in the event the
situation was black as the little frenchman
had painted and that they overcame the
perils together

  i must have swilled too much cognac
last night duval growled to wayne the
next morning he had a pounding head
remorse too it seemed only a fool
would return to mata-gara but i stick to
my word if i signed the agreement with
you ill go through with it

  i promise you no regrets laugbed
wayne well make a good team to-
gether   

so it was they set out together for the
wild jungles of mata-gara they trav-
eled with one other companion-nglana
the zulu who had been highly recom-
mended to wayne as a guide and all-
round capable bush-man and they reached
their destination swiftly and without mis-
hap

  the mines were located along a river
standing ten miles apart from each other
number one was a hillside tunnel while
the second mine was a series of three
shallow pits set in about the thickest jun-
gle wayne had ever seen his first in-
spection of the mines proved two things-
that they were in as terrible shape as du-
val had said and that the mines were rich
with ore

  im putting you duval in charge of
mine number one he said ill see
what i can do at the pits

  which was the beginning of a month of
hell it would have been difficult enough
getting the mines in order with experienced
white crews the natives that peopled the
district were lazy and sullen knowing
little of civilized methods and customs
but wayne and duval were too much of

stories

jungle veterans to pamper the blacks as
davis the former owner had done they
drove the workers without mercy and by
the end of thirty days the mines were op-
erating somewhat efficiently giving prom-
ise of ultimate results

  and now wayne had found the corpse
in the pit

  he stood a long while on the bungalow
puffing silently at his pipe his eyes study-
ing the quiet native huts in the clearing
before him inwardly he cursed himself
for imagining crazy thoughts about the
tremendous claw-marks hed seen on
moolis torn remains no lion was large
enough to have a paw like that the only
answer was that the swelling of the corpse
had distended the skin thus enlarging what
had been normal claw-marks

  thats the way it was he muttered to
himself im sure of it

  but he wasnt sure and with uncer-
tainty came worry the only sensible thing
it seemed would be to go and talk to du-
val who had been through this before

  he took his rifle in the crook of his arm
and left his bungalow he headed along
a crooked jungle trail passed beneath some
moss-draped baobab trees until he came
to the place where some half-dozen native
canoes were drawn up on the bank of the
murky-watered river disturbed apes
scolded him from the trees rousing some
tiny sunbirds which flushed across the
river like flashing iridescent light

  tony wayne shoved one of the canoes
into the river he leaped into it and stroked
with the paddle sending the light craft
swiftly down-stream

  his was the automatic untiring stroke
of a man accustomed to jungle travel dis-
tance melted away behind him and it was
not long before he came into the lush hills
of tangled bush where mine number one
was located

  it was then that death rode the air again
one moment the gentle breeze sent the
sweet scent of maheena blooms drifting
across the river in the next all this fra-
grance was suddenly blotted out by the
terrible stench of putrifying dead bodies

  the change was so unnatural and hor-
rible a chill rippled down waynes spine
he shook off his wild thoughts slowed
his canoe circling the river as he searched
the shores for signs of a rotting corpse
death-plague

  there was no corpse in the vicinity

  he was convinced of it when he resumed
his course toward the mine for the stench
did not lessen in the air it was like an
evil pall over the jungle and he found
himself thinking again of gimshai the aw-
ful native god of death which they call
the eater of souls

  finally he paddled up to the flat river
bank where other canoes were beached
leaped out and pulled his craft up beside
them then he set out along the well-trod-
den trail that led to the hillside where the
mine was located

a small native village stood at the base
of the low hill reaching there he
was sickened by the stench of death in the
air horror and fear hung over the settle-
ment black men walked the kraal ner-
vously their labors in the mine forgotten
fear had tightened their faces and they
held their clenched hands close to their
spears

  duval came out to meet wayne the
face of the blocky little frenchman was as
grim and tight-set as the features of his
ebony workmen

  well said wayne

  nom du diable cried duval it has
come like a sudden thunderbolt yester-
day all was serene and happy now
twenty-five men lay sick to death of some
queer fever that has struck at us overnight
and that is not the worst gimshai-

  we cant believe native mumbo-jum-
bo gritted wayne there is some logi-
cal explanation for all that is happening
someone is--

  duval held up his hand wait wayne
i want you to see something else first
before you argue the point come with
me and ill show you

  wayne eyed him a long minute then
wordlessly began following the little
frenchman silent natives stepped out of
the way as duval walked from the kraal
following a narrow overgrown trail which
led off to the south it was the trail that
led to the village water hole

  duval stopped at the water hole to
point out the ghastly thing that lay
beside it it was a twisted corpse of a
black man who had obviously been mauled
by a lion and for a nerve - crawling
moment wayne stared at the horribly

of mata-gara	

torn body claw-marks were plain on the
corpse-claw-marks larger than any ordi-
nary lion would make

  if you still have doubt examine this
duval said in a thick tone he stooped
down and pointed at the marks in the
boggy earth alongside the water hole

  waynes blood turned to ice in his veins
as he studied the marks they were the
tracks of a gigantic lion-one that must
have been the size of a water buffalo

  now do you disbelieve duval asked
him now do you see why i begged you
to sell these mines  its something a
white man cant lick jungle magic that-
jungle magic or hell itself isnt going
to lick me wayne told him in a cold
voice his lean face was granite-hard
challenging i can fight too and dont
give a damn whether its men or devils
against me duval i intend to get these
mines going or-

  his voice broke off as a lion bellowed
from the nearby bush it was a hideous
shattering din like the familiar warning cry
of the king of beasts-except that it was
a dozen times louder than any lions roar

  there it is the roar of gimshais
cursed juju lion shouted duval in a
shaking voice we better get out of this
mata-gara bush before gimshai brings us
to our ends

  wayne hardly heard the frenchmans
frenzied cries a great rage swept him
and he swung his rifle from his shoulder
he levered a cartridge into the chamber

 duval stared diable what are
you    

  im going hunting wayne growled
and grimly set off in the direction of the
roaring lion with no thought of personal
danger he plunged into the tangled under-
growth of the jungle in search of the fear-
some beast

  as he cautiously stalked through the
wilderness the lion momentarily stilled its
loud roaring he sensed that the beast
had become aware of him but he was
wrong the roar of the lion sounded again
this time from a distance south of him
cursing he turned in that direction

  his one passion was to get face to face
with the awful lion and slay it the beast
though seemed to elude him its roaring
coming first on one side of him then upon
the other yet wayne kept relentlessly on
	jungle

its trail his winchester poised and ready
in his sweaty fingers

  for a long while he kept on until all
at once he noticed the lion was a dis-
tance from him roaring way back from
the vicinity where he had started his search
he became furious with angry frustration
it was uncanny how a lion could shift its
position so swiftly lions ordinarily
didnt-

  the realization chilled him that perhaps
the natives were right perhaps this lion
was not a living thing but something con-
jured up by the dreadful gimshai

  yet he knew it was only his frenzied
anger that was making him think such
thoughts he turned and trudged back the
distance to the mine and as he walked
he was taunted by the distant challenge of
the huge lion

he did not resume the hunt upon his re-
turn to the mine the blacks stood in
groups watching him in fearful silence as
he entered their kraal duval was waiting
there too and wayne walked grimly up
to him

  i couldnt get near the lion he said
in a strained quiet tone now let me
examine your sick

  duval said nothing soberly he took
wayne on a round of the huts showing
him the stricken men two of them
plainly were dying it was a vomiting
disease that afflicted them accompanied by
fever wayne had seen nothing like it
before but he said nothing about it nor
did he comment on the strange fact that
sickness had come with that unexplainable
stench of the dead that was in the air

  treat them the best you can duval
use what drugs you have its all we can
do he said finally and walked abruptly
out into the sunshine again the roar of
the lion reverberated the bush once more
and the black natives began wailing weird
prayers to their gods

  wayne hardly listened to any of this
he was concerned over the other mine
if things were happening here trouble
must be brewing up-river too he went
at a jogging run to his canoe he shoved
it out to the current as he leaped in and
began paddling with swift powerful
strokes

  it was a relief to get- out of the foul

stories

odors that hung over the mine yet some
time later when he drew close to the other
mine his jaw went hard-because that
same vile sickening death-stench was there
also

  worse that horrible lion beast seemed
to have preceded him there for the great
noise of its roaring was chilling the
bush

  nglana was waiting at the river bank
when wayne pulled his canoe up the big
zulu stood motionless his weapons in his
hands peculiarly the fear that had so char-
acterized him earlier was absent from his
dark face

  i want speech with thee bwana he
said

  i know about whats happening wayne
snapped irritably youre going to tell me
that i was wrong-that gimshai and his
lion-beast is stalking this bushland for us
i know only that it is the will of the
gods that we fight or die but we cannot
do battle alone bwana i know of a brave
tribe that lives not a great march from
here i can go and fetch them here to
fight beside thee

  wayne turned on him skeptically do
they fear gimshai the eater of souls
wah all jungle people fear gimshai
 then they would be useless here they
would fear death as the others wayne
said in disgust and walked up the trail
to the clearing

  and new rage rose within him when he
came striding into the native kraal black
mine workmen were assembled there they
had deserted their labors in the pits

  what is the reason for this he de-
manded loudly as he strode among them
why are you not in the pits

  one of them faced him sullenly and
said the smell of death is around us
the juju lion walks the bush ready to
obey gimshais every command

  wah return to your work lest trouble
start

  the black man did not move trouble
will start if we do it is our plan to stay
ut of the pits--to avoid all white-man
work gimshai will not harm us then
waynes lips tightened his nar-
rowed eyes studied the tense sullen
company before him they were jungle
savages always dangerous as they were
unpredictable
death-plague

  i command you return into the pits

  the dead cannot command bwana
cried the black he leaped toward wayne
his knife flashing from his girdle there
was murder in his blazing distended gaze

  wayne moved with fluid speed firing
over the heads of the blacks the rifle
thundered like ordnance in the kraal
stopped the men in their tracks for a
moment wayne stood unafraid before
them his face cold

  you and your numbers could over-
power me but some of you will die with
me he said come forward now if you
want to die next time i shoot to kill

  the black men stood undecided waver-
ing

  killing the bwana will bring us noth-
ing calmly spoke the voice of nglana
from behind wayne nor will it aid us
to stay out of the pits let us return there
i have faith in our bwana he will prevent
our deaths he alone can prevent our
deaths

  for a long minute all stood in a grim
tableau then a few men began walking
toward the mine road others followed
until all began trudging back toward the
gold pits

  nglanas words wayne knew hadnt
brought about this obedience rather it
was that the men knew wayne would kill
some of them before he fell each of the
simple-minded blacks had submitted only
in the craven fear that he might be one
of them who would die with the bwana

  wayne breathed in relief he turned
to the zulu and said i am in your debt
good nglana i will not forget what you
have done for me

  nglana made no reply silently he
walked past the white man and headed
for the pits

  wayne turned to his bungalow sat for
a long while on the verandah- the death-
stench was an invisible fog that permeated
everything distantly came the roaring of
that huge lion he kept his rifle beside him
because he sensed trouble if it did not
come from this mysterious menace that
hovered over the mine it would rise from
the fear-frenzied natives themselves

  the day gradually spent itself with the
falling of darkness a handful of native
workers emerged from the pits road and
entered the kraal puzzled wayne went

of mata-gara	

down to the cooking fires and asked them
about the others

  they are not returning one of the
blacks said they have fled into the bush
believing it offers more safety than thee
bwana

  wayne hid his disturbed feelings behind
an emotionless face he asked what of
nglana i do not see the zulu among
you

  he went with them the speaker said
over his shoulder as he and his companions
stepped toward their huts the zulu lied
before when he said he trusted you

  wayne stared after them scowling
with these few faithful workmen hed be
handicapped the mine would fall to ruin
again

  and duval would have similar deser-
tions at the other diggings more men
would die horribly

  it would mean the end to this mining
venture except that tony wayne wasnt
a person to give in to defeat he would
not submit until he was beaten to hands
and knees and literally trampled to death
it was his nature

  a full moon rose later leering down on
mata-gara like a cruel laughing god and
spreading a pale emotionless light over
the brooding jungle-land the huge lion
bellowed in the distance dimming the
chorus of other lions by its nerve-chilling
vociferation behind this came the occa-
sional ghostly cry of leopards the muted
shrieks of hyenas and lemurs

  the kraal itself throbbed to the muffled
funereal beat of tom-toms native women
wailed in dreadful monotones streaking
their bodies with ashes they chanted sing-
song entreaties to their gods for safekeep-
ing

so weird and fantastic was all this
wayne sensed a queer foreboding the
frightening sensation that nothing was
before him except death desperately he
strove to thrust the insisting premonition
from his mind

  he lay himself down on his cot inside
the bungalow-not to sleep but to think
over all the fantastic ramifications of his
heartbreaking predicament with the hope
of finding a solution yet his weariness
manifested itself and he fell sound asleep
it was no pleasant rest he dreamed of a
	jungle

horrible monster that pursued him mean-
ing to devour his very soul   

  with a start he awakened dazed by the
horror of his dreams he did not move for
a moment he had slept long the kraal
was quiet now even the damnable roaring
of that huge lion was stilled the moon
had half-crossed the sky its bright rays
painting silver squares on the floor be-
side the windows

  then abruptly he realized that he was
not alone in the room the snuffled sound
of breathing came to him the soft slither-
ing of naked feet moving cautiously toward
his cot and when he rolled his eyes to
the right he caught a glimpse of the
intruder

  it was one of the naked blacks who had
deserted from the pits and waynes
muscles tightened when he saw the hor-
rible device the man grasped in his hands
the war-club was huge heavy and its
wide knobbed end was fitted with razor-
sharp hooked knives blows with this
inhuman weapon wayne realized would
simulate lion claw-marks of gigantic size

  the black man was almost beside the
cot he caught his snuffling breath with
a hard muscular stroke he swept the huge
war-club downward

  but wayne had moved as fast as any
human could rolling from the cot as the
club crashed down the awful hooked
knives raked through the canvas of the
cot the club catching in the cloth momen-
tarily and wayne was diving across the
cot before the cursing murderer could
dislodge his weapon raining hard flailing
fists upon the black man

  grunting from the blows the native
whirled dashed in mad frantic flight from
the bungalow wayne chased after him
through the moon-bright darkness but the
black man got beyond the clearing and
the juiigle swallowed him up

  wayne stood a moment at the jungles
edge then went striding back to the bun-
galow to examine the fallen war-club it
cemented into his mind the truth that this
mystery that had befallen the mines was
not supernatural but vicious and sinister
trickery

  still what reason could be behind this
hellishness what motive could these na-
tives have that prompted them into brutally
slaying people of their own kraal

stories

  an inkling of the truth crept into his
startled mind then first he rejected the
possibility scornfully nevertheless as he
reviewed the past in his mind he saw that
he could not be wrong and it brought
great rage upon him--the will to bring
to an end this horrible business

  but how to begin what move    

  as if in answer to his very pondering
the loud tremendous roaring rose again
from deep in the bush it was as though
gimshai the eater of souls were hurling
a taunting challenge at this puny defiant
white man

it was a challenge that tony wayne
accepted his face hard and grim he
hurried out of the bungalow carrying his
rifle in the crook of his arm he gave no
thought to the added perils one finds in
the bush at night but plunged purposefully
into the thick tangle of the jungle

  the challenging lion-roar kept on as
wayne fought his way through frondiferous
undergrowth growing louder with every
forward step the moon-brightness gave
him good visibility in the dark-shadowed
bush noiseless alert to signs on all sides
of him he moved anxiously toward the
chilling sound of that tremendous lion-
roaring

  he stopped at last his lean body tight-
drawn ready the rifle poised in his hands
the lion-roaring was directly in front of
him tremendous-sounding as the din of a
cavern waterfall

  he crept slowly forward and less than
ten paces took him to the edge of a grassy
moonlighted glade a naked black man
was seated cross-legged in the center of
the glade and wayne recognized him as
another of his deserters the native had
a huge war-drum fastened to the earth and
was pulling over and over upon the rosined
cord that was fastened to the drumhead
the drum vibrated with awful sound and
the earth was a soundboard that turned
the noise into a gigantic roaring

  tony wayne stepped silently into the
glade and was almost beside the native
before the black man saw him abruptly
the black ceased pulling at the drum-cord
and the following silence was intense al-
most frightening by contrast

  wayne gestured with his rifle stand
up
death-plague

  the native eyed him then slowly rose
no fear stood on his black face merely
sullen insolence

  what do you think you can do bwana
the native sneered

  im going to use you wayne snarled
at him im going to use you to bring
duvals dirty plot crashing down on his
head

  you the native laughed mockingly

  an angry retort leaped to waynes lips
only to wither to a horrified silence when
suddenly he caught the reason behind the
blacks taunting mockery the inky
shadows on either side of the glade trans-
formed themselves into the shapes of men
--naked screaming black men who raced
out brandishing spears and knives their
widened eyes bright in the moonlight with
blood-lust

  wayne fell back a step whipping his
rifle up to his shoulder he knew he had
walked into a death-trap but he did
not intend to die alone

  yet he fired not one shot in the ex-
citing moment he was unthinking that
men had stolen into the glade behind him
as well a spear-handle struck him
brutally on the head knocking him to his
knees then the spear struck a second
time and all his awareness was abruptly
blotted out by a black hot silence   

  the next moment so it seemed he found
himself standing erect again with the
return of awareness he realized he was
leaning against the slanting bole of an old
tree his arms about the trunk his wrists
bound together with tonga cords black
natives stood in a sullen circle about him
watching they watched too the blocky
little frenchman who was regarding wayne
coldly

  youve been a fool wayne duval
said i gave you a dozen chances to get
out from under but you insisted on be-
ing stubborn about it

  wayne eyed the blacks all men who
had been his workers at the mines they
were hard ignorant savages incapable of
such intricate machinations as had taken
place-which was why he had suspected
duval

  seems to me duval he said you
want the mines pretty bad to commit mur-
der

  the mines are rightfully mine hissed

of mata-gara	

duval i told a prospector about the
gold here but he cheated me out of it
when he uncovered the ore thats why

i	started trouble a mans got a right
fighting for his own property

nphe golds driven you insane you
-l mean grunted wayne by some
means you got this group of blacks to work
with you you capitalized on the jungle
fear of gimshai manufactured horror ef-
fects having these renegade blacks kill
men of their own tribe to heighten your
effects

  they killed only men they hated and
the apparently deathly sick men you saw
at the other mines are up and around now
-the result of a harmless root poison they
have all been paid well-for the lion-noise
and the death-stench as well there is
little smoke when you burn dried segaini
leaves but the stench is like rotting corpses
so intense it spreads over the countryside
all this so owner after owner of the
mines will give up yes so the price of
the mines will come down to where you
can get them for a pittance

  duval growled i did get the price
down but you outbid me and beat me out
of the mines thats why i waited for
you in leopoldville why i let you talk me
into accompanying you i wanted to se
personally that you did not keep the mines
but youve been stubborn which was
why i sent the man over to kill you with
the claw-club when that failed i had the
lion-noise created you suspected the
truth and would naturally follow the noise
and fall into my trap

  so you can murder me in cold blood
no one is committing murder let no
man touch the bwana lest he die wah
it is my warning to all

  everyone whirled at the sound of this
loud commanding voice that spoke from
behind them in the glade standing alone
magnificent was the towering black figure
of nglana

  loose the bwana he commanded
nglana is but one man and you are
many cried duval loudly strike
him down  kill the zulu

  the frenchmans words broke down his
blacks hesitancy bulala kill they
screamed and flooded in a wild furious
stream toward the tall motionless zulu
	jungle

 still nglana did not move and as

before the shadows of the glade became
alife again and a horde of warriors from
some other tribe closed in on every side
without ruth or mercy spears and war-
clubs flashed as the tribesmen fell upon
duvals murderers and slew them

  duval was terror-stricken at this sud-
den unexpected attack he turned and
tried to flee but was knocked down and
dragged back cringing

  earlier today i overheard two of these
jackals whispering in the pit nglana
said as he loosened wayne from the tree
from their talk it made me believe all
the mystery was man-made mischief that
is why i said to thee that we must get aid
from this other friendly tribe when you
refused i saw nothing except for me to
go for help regardless i left at the same
time these jackals deserted your pits and
returned to the kraal in time to see you
rush out into the bush we followed you
here and saw what was taking place

 wayne was incredulous why didnt
you tell me what you overheard in the pits 
why-

 you are a strong mighty bwana but
stubborn as tembu himself i feared you
would not believe and i wanted these
warriors behind me so i could prove the

stories

evil that was in progress under the guise
of magic i believed-

  screaming duval ripped himself from
the tribesmen who restrained him he
raced wildly for the jungle

  stop duval wayne shouted you
cant get away

  and the frenchman did not get away
nglana it seemed barely moved so ef-
fortless did he loft the spear he was grip-
ping the spear flashed in the moonlight
thudded sickeningly into duvals back
impaling him

  it is justice bwana he murdered
many men of my race solemnly said the
zulu come now let us return to the
kraal with our good tidings

  no man has a greater friend than thou

o	nglana said wayne fervently i am
humble before thee

  thus it was they set out through the
jungle for the kraal leaving the dead be-
hind them for the assvoels the bush was
strangely quiet save for the drone of in-
sects the croak of tree-frogs and the occa-
sional challenging roar of a lion in the dis-
tance it was a lazy peace a serenity that
belongs to the african jungle-land when
all is well with its good people

  the terrors of gimshai the eater of
souls was gone from mata-gara

wild and frenzied screams cut the jungle night and nyuas stench of death

a rifle spoke out of the tangled	hardly more than a whispered cough wing-

tomary quiet-shattering report but with	naked breast he collapsed into the trail
	jungle

his innocent life blotted out by a merciless
hand

  his two hunting companions whirled in
horror and amazement bent down over
him and after they saw how the man
had died red hate blazed within their
hearts

  the white juju they cried the
flaming spear of the white man that kills
without any sound

  nervous fear mingled with their rage
their rage though was the stronger and
they began frenziedly beating through the
nearby fronds assegais poised searching
for this murderer who was killing their
hunters with a gun that made no sound
they found nothing they knew they
would find nothing this awful slayer was
a white mans juju a juju ghost they be-
lieved was invisible as the air they
breathed

  the blacks both tall magnificently-pro-
portioned fighting men were hunters of
the guntali tribe which ruled this steam-
ing wilderness of tembu-loma by the
power of their arms and by their strange
and terrible magic fear of the super-
natural stood alive on their faces when they
returned to their fallen brother they
hastily constructed a litter and carried the
dead man down the trail to their nearby
village

  the village was a large circle of grass-
thatched huts the huts were grouped
about a round barren compound where
towered a large stone image of nyua their
powerful ancestral fire-god it was a hide-
ous crude sculpture of red stone and in
its malignant unblinking gaze brooded a
sullen evil menace that chilled the hearts
of all men who looked upon it

  an old crone in the compound saw the
hunters coming down into the village with
their ghastly burden and shrilled out in
excitement pointing toward them her
cry brought guntali men and women hur-
rying from their huts they milled around
the hunters their superstitious fears
drowned out by their raging cries for ven-
geance the kraal became a churning mass
of black naked bodies angry shouts fused
into one gigantic roar that seemed to re-
verberate against the shimmering heat of
the coppery african sky

  the hunters trudged solemnly forward
through this confusion they laid the dead

stories

man down at last beside the base of the
great idol of nyua and as they did the
tall figure of bwalla king of the guntalis
loomed up within this frenzied throng

bwalla was dressed with the naked
simplicity of his people his strangely
intelligent features were tight-set cold
without any trace of the insane fury of the
others bitterness stood like a gray cloud
in his keen steady gaze as he looked down
upon the bloody form of the slain hunter

  o king the white men have brought
their juju curse upon us for a reason one
warrior shouted at him they mean to
drive us from our land so it can become
their own

  we must drive them out of our country
to save ourselves another screamed
wildly brandishing his spear our weap-
ons cry to run red with their cursed blood
bwalla raised his hand for quiet he
shook his head and said open warfare
against white men will bring only disaster
unto our people

  the blood-hungry inflamed throng on
all sides of him stared in wonder and sur-
prise one of them in the rear cried is
it that our king is afraid when our ranks
outnumber these enemies as a mans fin-
gers outnumber his nose

  our enemies have hosts of white war-
riors camped at the great water beyond
our bush replied bwalla all of them
armed with flaming spears once we
strike these warriors would be called to
aid the whites and it would be our blood
that would dye the trails of our country
we would rather die than be driven out
of our homes a warrior shrilled angrily

  none of us will die for we have a
power even greater than white men
bwalla told him we will tell bwana
kirk the leader of all white men in our
land that he has two hands of suns to re-
move his people from this brush other-
wise we will call upon our great protector
for assistance and he raised his hand
and pointed grimly up at the hideous idol
that towered over the village

     all eyes turned up to look at this an-
cestor god a fearful awed hush settled
over everyone and bwallas voice boomed
out like a knell of doom for their enemies

  you saw not long past when we wrere
the weaker and the nglanas the stronger
the rifle spat lead and fire and bori died


	jungle

people of this bush you saw the nglanas
persecuting us with their cruelty and how
i held rites that summoned nyua out of
his holy grave to aid us you saw also
how the stench of nyuas swamp tomb
entered the nglana kraal nglana war-
riors were burned to death by fire that did
not scorch the earth at their feet plagues
and sickness struck at them until they
were reduced to a handful and scattered
to the corners of this bush

   that the king concluded bitterly is
what will befall all whites who do not de-
part our land i have long reverenced
bwana kirk and his golden-haired wife

i believe in all the good things they gave
to us but i see now that this was all
trickery they mean to do us evil-not
good-and desire possession of this land
that was ours since the ancient day when
nyua was our first king

   he turned to a stolid warrior beside him
kunato you told me that three suns past
you saw bwana kirk trekking the bush
near here go now and find him and tell
him all this i have said all white men
must depart from this bush or endure the
wrath of nyua tell him further that if
his juju of the silent flaming spear strikes
at us again during these two hands of
suns i will summon forth nyua at once
to strike at all that is his wah i have
spoken

  the warrior turned then and hurried
away

   bwalla watched him depart then trudged
heavily back toward his hut bitterness
dulling the whole of his smooth ebon face
it was the bitterness of a man who was
crushed and disillusioned that his dearest
friends-as kirk and his golden-haired
wife had been-had turned so evilly against
him and his people

ii

high noon two days later marty
kirk was at his productive tin mine
deep in the heart of tembu-loma it was
his regular periodic visit for a conference
with joe grimm his mine manager and
that moment he was preparing to depart
on his trek back to his settlement and the
white-washed bungalow where jane his
wife was waiting his return two days
journey to the north

stories

   marty kirk was a lean lank american
red-haired and capable-looking he was
the man who had made the first explora-
tions of this wild inland territory ulti-
mately developing this tin deposit and in-
viting other white men to prospect and
develop the rich ore deposits and because
he was the logical man for the task the
governor-general had appointed him com-
missioner of tembu-loma

  he and jane had done many things for
the district even taking the nglanas under
their wing after the fierce tribes trouble
with the guntalis educating them turning
them into mine workmen and training the
more apt into a company of riflemen-the
unofficial soldiers of his settlement

  he was assembled with these riflemen
in the workmen settlement of the mine
joe grimm the stocky stiff-spined aus-
trian manager was beside him talking
bori the intelligent rather sharp-witted
nglana chief was supervising the depar-
ture for he was kirks headman drawn
up behind kirk waiting were eight
nglanas-all hunters-who were deeply
devoted to him they were lakeeto his
son gawai and six other young nglanas
who were gawais close companions

   then in that moment of bustle and ac-
tivity a stunned silence abruptly fell over
the vicinity the nglanas stood in hushed
groups staring toward the north edge of
the small jungle basin where the mine was
located

  what in hells wrong spoke up joe
grimm why are the men-

  look said kirk pointing a gun-
tali warriors entered the basin over there
and is coming toward us

  so there is i thought you had an
agreement with bwalla that no guntalis
come near this mine

  i have and i know bwalla wouldnt
go back on his word unless something is
wrong muttered kirk

   in the charged quiet that hung over the
humid air he saw the warrior advance
nearer and he recognized him-a guntalis
named kunato

   kunato he said in swahili when the
warrior stepped before him why do you
come to this forbidden place

   i come to warn you out of this bush
kunato answered we have learned all
white men are enemies and that your
the jungle of

tongue is forked as that of ginzina the
serpent

  kirks brown angular jaw tightened he
asked evenly can it be that friend turns
against friend 

  friendship between us is ended ku-
nato said and he told him of the sound-
less rifleman who was slaying guntali hunt-
ers from ambush and of bwallas terrible
warning to all white men

kirk was angered shocked learning
that someone was murdering innocent
natives by a rifle fitted with a silencer

  this is no murder by ghosts kunato
he said desperately it is plain that one
of the white men in tembu-loma-by
stealth unknown to me until now-is com-
mitting these killings for some personal mo-
tive therefore go back and inform bwalla
that this moment i am sending out mes-
sengers to all the wthite men camps in-
structing the whites to assemble at once
at my official settlement

  i will question all and learn who the
killer is when this is known i will bring
the slayer to your kraal and execute him
before all your people in addition i will
make payments in goods and privileges to
make up for the loss of your brave inno-
cent hunters that is my solemn promise
kunato smirked i will return and tell
my king this but i know he will not be-
lieve your promises all men know that
there is no human alive who can shoot
one of your flaming spears without the ter-
rible noise it makes

  he gestured with his hand but re-
member this bwana-if any other hunter
is slain by this noiseless white juju within
the two hands of suns promised you great
bwalla will call nyua from his holy grave
at once and the wrath of our powerful
god will descend upon all that is yours
without further speech he turned trot-
ting away he vanished into the grove
that partially circled the kraal of the
nglana mine workmen

  kirk heard the moans of fear and horror
from the assembled nglanas even chief
bori shared this terror fierce fighting
man though he was he cringed beside kirk

  we must depart from this bush he
wailed or sicknesses and death by a fire
that strikes invisibly out of the very air
will befall us my tribe suffered horribly

charred corpses	

when bwalla called up nyua against us
it will happen now to thee

  joe grimm the mine manager snorted
with disgust he said bwalla merely
used tricks against you bori and you be-
lieved it magic no man is powerful
enough to raise the ancient dead from their
graves

  hopelessness dulled boris eyes do
not scoff heed rather the power of nyua
to bring suffering and destruction to all
of us there is nothing for us to do but
trek from this land

  you talk like a child-man grimm re-
proached him scowling he turned to
kirk what do you make of this crazy
business marty

  i never lock my storehouses at my
settlement kirk replied the white men
who are prospecting around here are free
to take any supplies food or arms that
they need because jane and i are inter-
ested in their success we want to see
tembu-loma developed into a fine civ-
ilized colony

  i dont follow you frowned grimm
its simply this i received a rifle si-
lencer as a gift from an explorer i guided
up the congo a few years ago that si-
lencer was in the gun cabinet of one of
the storehouses plainly one of these
men has taken the silencer and is using it
to murder innocent guntalis

  grimm gasped noisily which man
dyou think-

  any of them could have taken it all
of them come to the settlement often-and
just as often use my storehouses to fill
their personal needs kirks voice be-
came hard brittle and one of them is
a murderer he has some dirty reason
for wanting to drive the guntalis to revolt
by killing their hunters with a silenced
rifle

  who the devil would want to do that 
thats a question weve got to answer
within ten days-or well be in for hell or
worse

  grimm jerked marty you arent crazy
enough to believe that bwalla can hokus-
pokus a corpse from the grave

  i dont know what to think but i
feel that whatever happens wont be pleas-
ant i was here in tembu-loma when the
nyua curse was placed on the nglanas i
saw how an epidemic of strange sicknesses
	jungle

gripped their kraal and saw even stranger
murders for which i still have no logical
explanation

  meaning weve got to discover the iden-
tity of this murderer and prove his guilt
to bwallas satisfaction grimms face
was tight grave can we do this in ten
days 

  well do our best said kirk ill
send runners to the camps of these men at
once all the camps are within a days
trek of my settlement and if we set out
there at once the men should be assembled
when we arrive

  we you mean i should go with
you 

  you are one man in this jungle whom
i trust i will need your help in this busi-
ness nodded kirk he turned sharply
to bori the nglana chief so that fleet
runners could be dispatched at once

in

after the runners were chosen and
sent on kirk started his two-day
march toward his settlement and home
chief bori trudged in the lead of the party
the white men came next with lakeeto
his son gawai and gawais six young
hunter companions pacing behind them
the remainder of the blacks marched at
the rear

  kirk walked silently thinking of jane
his wife waiting back there at the settle-
ment she was an admirer of bwalla and
believed the kings tribe were their friends
it wasnt going to be easy telling her that
the guntalis had turned against them and
had become their enemies

  hours ground by and the jungle
thinned the trail turned into a ridge of
soggy mud hemmed on both sides by stag-
nant scum-green water dotted with bar-
ren broken trees that were webbed with
ugly festoons of sickly-gray moss the
swamp was a morass of crocodiles hideous
horned lizards and deadly quicksands

  finally the fulsome stench of the swamp
assailed them and the nglanas bunched
together in fear and quickened their pace
for this was the swamp of nyua

  the swamp was where the guntali an-
cestor-god was entombed and every black
man of tembu-loma believed that the nau-
seating stench exuded from the ancient

stories

grave itself it made them shun the dread-
ful place

  the soggy trail debouched into a small
flat plateau in the center of this unnat-
urally barren high ground was the pile
of weathered rocks that marked nyuas
grave-nyua the father of the guntali
tribe who had died more than a century
before as the party hurried by kirks
eyes were magnetically drawn toward the
aged grave

  he had come through here the last time
the risen nyua had prowled this jungle
and had seen how the rocks of the grave
had been thrown aside and only a yawn-
ing hole had marked the place where the
grave had been and getting later to the
nglana kraal it seemed the stench of the
swamp had followed him for the village
was rank with it a queer plague of sick-
nesses gripped the tribe also he saw how
sentinels of the village had literally been
consumed by fire at their posts while not
a blade of grass about them had been
scorched

  and after the horrible business came to
an end he had seen nyuas tomb again
the rocks sealing it as before a grave that
appeared as though it had never been dis-
turbed these many years

  he could find no answer to these things
despite that he knew king bawalla was
clever enough to resort to tricks and arti-
fices to fan superstitious minds both among
his own people and their enemies this
horror had been too real too unexplain-
able

  they got past the swamp at last and
the more comforting tangle of the jungle
wilderness closed in around them again
they trekked till dark camped and were
on the trail again before dawn kirk goad-
ing them to speed

  and the morning of the next day they
reached the densely-vegetated slope that
marked the southern boundary of his set-
tlement

  they descended down into the settle-
ment a long narrow tree-shaded glen
lined on both sides with native huts and
storehouses while at the east end of it
stood kirks trim whitewashed bungalow
which was his official residence as district
commissioner of tembu-loma

  kirk scowled when they got there for
there was no sign of the white men whom
the jungle of

he had summoned to meet him at this place
nor had the runners arrived yet

  i dont get this he growled at grimm
they should have beat us here by a good
eight to ten hours it makes me wonder-

  his voice dried in his throat as muffled
screams wild and frenzied knifed out of
his whitewashed bungalow

with a snarling curse he knocked
aside two nglanas near him in his
frantic haste to get to the residence

  his anxiety turned to awful dread as he
got nearer the bungalow for the smell of
the swamp-nyuas stench of death-stood
in the air he loped across the verandah
then stopped stock-still on the threshold
of the door gagging on that vile death-
smell that made the air of the bungalow
almost poisonous

  barely aware of the stench his eyes
were riveted upon one of his devoted
houseboys who was sitting dead on the
bench inside the door the houseboys
body was charred burned as if by an in-
tense flame-yet the wall beside him and
the bench incredibly were not even
scorched

  jane jane kirk cried running into
the house but there was no answer--no
sign of her anywhere and getting to the
bedroom he found the bed in a turmoil
the sheets soiled by the handprints of bony
fingers that had been besmirched with clay
and there was no clay in the vicinity the
only clay in tembu-loma was found in
the swamp of nyua

  jane had been carried away into the
jungle even as he had stood in the settle-
ment-carried away by an age-old corpse
that had risen from its ancient grave

  a cry of rage welling in his throat he
ran out to the company of fear-numbed
nglanas who were assembled outside the
bungalow he shouted search the bush
about the settlement jane has been kid-
naped 

  it was the beginning of a wild search
but kirk was soon to call it oil there
was no sign of her anywhere it was as
though the very earth had swallowed her
up

  why though had she been carried
away why hadnt she been murdered in
the same gruesome manner like that house-
boy

charred corpses	

  he headed back toward the bungalow
and in his mind he could still hear the
warning voice of kunato the guntali
warrior had said    if any other hunter
is slain by this noiseless white juju within
the two hands of suns promised you great
bwalla will call nyua from his holy grave
at once and the wrath of our powerful god
will descend upon all that is yours

  it was apparent that another hunter had
recently died by the silenced gun and
king bwalla had called up nyua to doom
all whites in this jungle but why had
jane been struck at first why had she
been singled out of all the white people in
tembu-loma

  kirk found grimm in the bungalow
the other houseboy is in the kitchen
burned to death the same as the first
the mine manager said thickly he wrung
his hands marty i cant understand it
my common sense tells me its some devil-
ish trickery on king bwallas part but
the way it looks-i cant make myself be-
lieve that an age-old corpse-

  kirk didnt listen to him he walked
past grimm as though the man did not
even exist   

a half hour later he was in the
center of the glen facing his col-
lection of nglanas who were grouped
frightened and numbed before him they
stared in awe at their master he was
like one who had lost his soul-cold hard-
eyed without a trace of friendliness and
compassion on his brown rock-like face

  the white men have not come here as
i instructed he said tonelessly neither
have the runners i sent for them some-
thing has happened to them or to the run-
ners before they could reach the white
man camps and seeing how the gun-
talis have struck at us we cannot pause
now to try and find which white man has
brought- this misery upon our bush we
must fight the guntali ancestor-god curse
without this weapon i had hoped to have

  no dead can rise out of the grave he
went on his voice rising slightly what-
ever happened to your tribe long ago was
guntali trickery even as this taking of my
dear wife was guntali trickery but i can
match king bwalla for cleverness i can
be stronger than nyua

  no man is stronger than nyua bori
	jungle

the nglana chief replied hollowly
bwana our fate is written all we can
do is leave this accursed place

  meaning we have water in our bodies
in place of blood snapped kirk bori
to give in to bwallas tricks would lose us
everything and i do not mean to lose
my dear wife-not while she still lives and
breathes

  his hard burning gaze swept over the
staring black men his voice was bleak
commanding terrible

  men of nglana he said it is my
plan that we march by stealth upon the
kraal of the guntalis for i know that it
is in their village where i can find jane
in the cover of darkness we will steal
her from them and when they pursue
us back here white soldiers will by that
time be here in the glen to subdue them
wait a minute broke in joe grimm
we cant stand up against the whole
guntali tribe with only this handful of
nglanas well be slaughtered like lice
we will stand up against them kirk
told him and it is my order to you that
you return to the mine and arm the other
nglanas-your workmen-who this min-
ute are there you will wait there in read-
iness in case of our need

  he swung away from the mine manager
and pressed a written letter into the hand
of a lithe young nglana who was famed
for his speed and endurance

  run down out of this country to the
boat-landing where the river turns away
from tembu-loma he ordered you
will be able to borrow a canoe at the trad-
ing post there go directly to the gov-
ernor-generals residence when you reach
the coast give him this letter and he
will send a large company of soldiers back
here with you

  the young nglana bobbed his head
tucked the message into his clout-girdle
and started fleetily away in a moment
the jungle swallowed him up

  chief bori was looking upon kirk a
grave expression on his fierce intelligent
black face

  bwana you cannot do this he said
to make us trek now into the bush will
be our deaths

  is it not better to die on the trail rather
than waiting for bwalla to murder us from
ambush kirk retorted harshly he

stories

stepped nearer him added dangerously
i am your master you must do as i
command if any man disobeys me it is
within my power to drive him out of this
settlement--alone

  chief bori licked his thick lips i am
only remembering what happened to our
people nyua is powerful

  i am powerful too bori and you must
believe in my power if trouble should
confront us when we go forth into the
bush i have the means of creating such
magic that the guntalis will grovel on their
faces in fear i promise to make them-
and even nyua-powerless before us
kirks voice rang out sharply aweing
the black men by its terrible intensity
then he turned away from them with
sure lithe steps he headed back toward
the residence

iv

they set off that afternoon and
trekked all the following day and the
next noon of that third day found marty
kirk and his grimly silent company of
nglanas moving along the trail deep in
the brooding heart of tembu-loma

  thoughts of lovely golden-haired jane
a girl who had been born in africa and
capably had trekked side by side with him
in the most perilous trails tortured kirk
he could think of nothing except her res-
cue it was like a scourge across his naked
flesh

  yet he was bewildered that the gun-
talis through nyua would strike first at
jane he was equally bewildered that
she had been taken away instead of being
murdered in some hideous fashion it al-
most seemed part of some kind of coldly
calculated plan

  what kind of plan  was it that bwalla
wanted to lure him into the jungle exactly
as he was doing did bwalla believe him
author of the white man juju that was
striking down the guntali hunters

  then for the first time since jane had
been taken away a lucid thought cut
through the feverish confusion of his mind
he recalled the fire sacrifice of nyua-
an old guntali ritual custom which he and
the governor-general were striving to
stamp out the recollection sent a shud-
der of horror rippling down his spine
the jungle of

  the guntalis had called upon their ter-
rible god to drive out all white men there-
fore it would be natural that they would
offer sacrifice to nyuas name and with
jane chosen as the enemy victim to be used
in this ceremony which took place only at
the first quarter of the moon   

  kirk swung to bori who paced stolidly
at his side he asked when will we see
the first quarter of the moon   

  the dark after tomorrows sun
bwana bori told him

  kirks face tightened it made him sure
a bit frantic too it would be the next
night before they reached the guntali kraal
-and to rescue jane they would have to
get there before the ceremony could begin

  we must press on with haste o chief
we must reach the guntali village when
the sun is still in the sky that is my
command

  bori eyed him levelly shrugged and
said only a miracle will bring us there
so speedily and he went the length of
their column shouting that the pace be
doubled

  kirk watched somewhat cheered at the
willingness of these nglanas he had an-
ticipated trouble from them - that they
would not march with him into the dangers
of the guntali country yet they had come
willingly

  that is all of them save gawai la -
keetos young warrior son and those six
other young nglanas who were his close
hunting companions they were visibly
worried plainly keyed up over the fact
that they had been ordered out to do battle
against an enemy no one could see

  kirk blamed it upon their youth still
he was wondering if it was his promise of
magic greater than that of bwalla that had
made the older men willing his magic
consisted of a few boxes of rockets and fire-
works which he had brought up from the
coast once and had never used fireworks
always struck terror into the hearts of black
men who had never before seen them

  this magic was likely to be of no avail
if they reached the guntali kraal during
the afternoon the peril of a daylight res-
cue was great

  at length they passed through the foul-
stenched swamp and across the small
plateau where nyuas grave was located

s-jungle stories-spring

charred corpses	

and the grave once again was as it had
been that time kirk looked upon it when
nyua had been called forth to prey upon
the nglanas the heavy stones of the
grave were strewn about and a yawning
hole gaped in the clay where the ancestor-
gods bones ordinarily rested

  gawai cried out in horror and began
running along the trail to get free of the
dreadful place his six companions and
most of the older nglanas were filled with
equal terror and hastened their pace

  it was a disordered frantic flight that
took the party swiftly into the jungle
wilderness beyond the swamp the
nglanas caught a grip on their fears then
and slowed down to a walk it relieved
kirk too that they were so quickly out
of that swamp the odors of the jungle
seemed clean beside that ghastly smell of
the dead

  but all at once everyone realized that the
stench had followed them out of the jungle
air about them like some formless vapor
the miasma of nyua rose up again-faint
at first but increasing in foul intensity as
moments passed it gave re-birth to the
fear-frenzies of the nglanas lakeeto and
a few of the other braver men gripped
weapons ready in their hands as their
eyes searched the bush about them for an
enemy they could not see

  the voice of gawai was a thin wail of
terror

  we are doomed he cried nyua is
pursuing us death will strike us before we
get near the guntali kraal

then almost miraculously the stench
dwindled away and only the more en-
durable odors of the jungle remained it
was so incredible that the entire company
stood in wonder

  nyua passed by and did not see us
chief bori observed solemnly it is our
luck-

  it was not luck quickly spoke up
kirk i carry on my person a juju that
is stronger than nyua nyua is afraid-
even as bwalla and the guntalis will be
afraid when we meet them my juju is all-
powerful

  he could see the sharp effect of his
words upon the nglanas the strange way
they looked upon him in that instant by
swift thinking he had saved his party from
	jungle

mutiny awe momentarily seemed to take
the place of terror

  the party resumed their journey once
more as they went on their silent way
the lethargic dreeing of the insects the
sharp child-like chatter of monkeys in the
treetops was an anodyne to their over-
wrought nerves

  there was no peace however in the
mind of marty kirk behind his impassive
face was concern and wonder the stench
rising up from nowhere in the trail and
vanishing again didnt seem a natural
thing

  he had to fight back the mad feel-
ing growing within him that the dead ac-
tually could be called up from the grave
worse some inner voice kept whispering
that new nerve-shaking terrors were wait-
ing them farther along the trail

   but it seemed that he was wrong they
made good time the remainder of the day
and there was no trace of nyua nor of the
odor of death it raised the spirits of the
blacks even of gawai and his youthful
companions and none spoke of fear and
danger any longer but of the good speed
they had made that day it was as though
they felt secure under the protection of this
mysterious powerful juju their white
leader had spoken about

   kirk made camp a short distance off the
trail it was a donga hemmed with baobab
and ironwood trees and flowering shrubs
that would screen their cooking fire from
the eyes of any possible prowling bands of
guntalis-a carefully chosen camping spot
halfway between the trail and the old mar-
agoona water hole

   as a repast of posho and strips of wild
pig was started gawai perhaps to atone
for his display of cowardice picked up the
goatskin and offered to go for water and
with his departure the tired men sat in a
circle about the fire discoursing little be-
tween each other a prowling lion
coughed its challenge deep in the bush
and it was answered by the wild cry of a
hyena none of the jnen seemed to hear
it they seemed content to sit and rest

   after a while lakeeto stood up

  what is keeping gawai bwana he
said to kirk it is not natural that my
man-son would tarry like this in a danger-
ous bush

   kirk started up he realized gawai had

stories

been gone the better part of a half hour
on a mission that should have taken no
more than five minutes

  wah he has been gone too long he
agreed

  bwana it might be best if we went to
the water hole and joined him remarked
bori a queer expression lay on his fire-
lighted ebon face he might have stum-
bled in the darkness and hurt himself

  so kirk lakeeto and bori left the
fireside and filed through the jungle to-
ward the maragoona

  they did not find gawai anywhere along
the trail to the water hole they found
him at the water hole itself and the youth-
ful hunter-warrior was dead

kirk shuddered when they saw by the
starlight how horribly gawai had
died his body was a charred mass gawai
had literally been consumed by fire-yet
by a fire that did not even scorch the grass
where he lay

  nyua whispered bori in awe he
has been following us and has fallen upon
poor gawai to consume him with his dev-
ilish spirit-fire

  kirk did not reply because lakeeto
spoke in a thickly muttered tone then
choked and terrible to hear

  my son--my man-child and lakeeto
bent down and picked the charred body up
tenderly in his arms he turned and began
walking back to the camp with his grisly
burden

  neither kirk nor bori said a word they
picked up the filled goatskin of water and
followed lakeeto

  every man in the camp rose in horror
as they saw what lakeeto carried into the
light of the fire gone was their sense of
security and in its place was wailing terror
and fear they milled about kirk beseech-
ing that they turn back before all met
their deaths by this mysterious all-con-
suming fire of nyua

  you have been wrong they cried at
him your juju is not as powerful as
nyua for this cruel guntali god has struck
at us once again

  my juju is still all-powerful kirk
told them it protects me and those about
me it did not protect gawai when he went
forth alone into the bush

  that is true spoke lakeeto now i
the jungle of charred corpses

 will go forth to bury my dead and i will
 return again because the dead do not dis-
 turb the dead

  he was a strangely magnificent figure
as he stepped fearlessly into the peril of
the haunted bush and no man tried to stop
him and after the hunter was gone kirk
noted that the remaining nglanas had con-
trol of their frantic fear the logic of his
argument backed by lakeeto seemed to
have some effect but they were no longer
relaxed but watchful of the jungle about
them

   lakeeto returned later without his son
 and sat apart heavy with grief as the
 others ate of the meal at last every man
 lay down beside the fire to get some rest

  there was much stirring in the long
hours following for sleep under the cir-
cumstances was not easy kirk heard all
this sleep was a stranger to him because
his mind was so alive with disturbing
thoughts-of jane in the cruel grip of the
guntalis and of this spine-chilling mystery
of the corpse of a cruel jungle god rising
up to do such evil work at last though
he did sleep-much more soundly than he
had expected 

  he awakened suddenly his head tor-
tured by a sharp headache dawn grayed
the jungle and he coughed choking on a
foul acrid odor that made him forget
the pain of his head he chilled to the aw-
ful realization that the stench of nyua was
thick upon the camp

   angrily a little frightened at the weird
 phenomenon he sat up and threw some
 tindery branches upon the red embers of
 the fire some of the nglanas wakened as
 he did they cried out at the ghastly smell
 of death and the entire camp stirred

   that is all except those six young com-
 panions of gawais and the rising flames
 of the kindled fire revealed why they did
 not rise they were dead-charred hor-
 ribly burned corpses each had been
 burned to death while lying side by side
 with kirk and the remaining nglanas

kirk stared in incredulous horror up
to that moment he had striven to con-
vince himself that all that had happened
had been guntali trickery but the gun-
talis could not enter a sleeping camp burn-
ing six men to death while the others slept
it hinted of what kirk did not and could



not believe-that the terrible nyua was
an actuality

   the nglanas were in a frenzy of terror
 that he could not control they milled
 about the donga in the wild fear that at
 any instant nyua would return to also
 slay them with this mysterious spirit-fire

   it was only through the efforts of chief
 bori that the men were gotten under con-
 trol bori then turned to kirk and said
 your juju-like all jujus we have tried-
 is powerless against nyua we cannot go
 on we do not care to die in this horrible
 way as have our companions

   kirks eyes turned grim burning but
he said nothing to bori and gestured la-
keeto up to his side

 - lakeeto he said go to bwana grimm
 at my mine and tell him to march upon
 the guntali kraal and join us at the cross-
 trail beside the river there is yet a way
 we can defeat cursed nyua for i still have
 another plan

   it will be done nodded lakeeto with
 the spontaneity natural to him he picked
 up his weapons and plunged into the jun-
 gle setting off for the mine which was
 not too far distant from that place

  the remaining men stood in a sullen
group

   pick up your burdens kirk said to
them we are proceeding toward the gun-
tali kraal we will meet bwana grimm
there as i told lakeeto i have another
plan

   chief bori moved nearer kirk all the
friendliness was gone from him a stub-
born sneer was on his black face

  plans and numbers mean nothing
against nyua he said we are not fools
we know that death is waiting in this
jungle for all of us there is nothing for
us to do but get out of tembu-loma as
quickly as we are able

   kirks features were rock-hard unread-
 able he had no new plan of action in
 fact he was as shaken by these queer
 events as they yet jane he was sure was
 being held at the guntali kraal as a sacri-
 fice victim while he still could lift a hand
 against man or ghoul he would do his
 utmost to save her from a ghastly fate

   you and your men bori are under my
orders he said harshly obey me or
else you will be punished

   no orders can detain us bori retorted
	jungle

we mean to turn back and get out of
this accursed place

  fury inflamed kirk also desperation
for janes life was in peril he whipped
up the heavy pistol that he carried on his
hip

  you are obeying my commands he
cried if any of you dare-

  the nglanas surged at him in a brutal
mass the pistol was knocked from his
grasp cursing fighting he strove to battle
against these frenzied black men-until a
rifle stock caught him a hard glancing
blow on the forehead

   he fell senseless beside the campfire

v

kirk felt as though he were struggling
in a tunnel of velvet darkness that
had no ending but at last he became aware
of the dreeing of the jungle insects the
sound of chattering monkeys scolding one
another and the muted cathedral choir of
golden-throated birds dazedly he pulled
himself to his knees and looked about the
vegetation-hemmed donga

  he did not know how much time had
passed but the day was fully light now
and he saw that he was alone in the camp
with only the gruesome charred remains
of the dead men beside him even his guns
and equipment had been taken away by the
deserting nglanas

  the full impact of his frightening pre-
dicament-that a ruthless peril-filled jun-
gle still lay before him and he was with-
out food or weapons-shook his numbed
aching brain and if he did not reach the
guntali village before dark fell that eve-
ning jane would die by torture

  for a moment he cursed the nglanas
-yet he could imagine the depths of their
fear that had brought them to leave him
in this place to die so that they might pre-
serve their own lives but it bothered him
that chief bori-so intelligent despite his
inborn savagery with reasoning equal to
white men-should iso cruely turn against
him too he had always felt bori would
remain loyal to him in any circumstances
-as he knew lakeeto would

  lakeeto recollection of the faithful
hunter and the mission he had gone on
raised kirks dwindled hope joe grimm

be marching toward the guntali kraal and
when he met them   

  it left him a fighting chance to rescue
jane and his eagerness to get on sent him
staggering out of the donga toward the
trail much of his grogginess was gone
after he reached the trail and he trekked
ahead at a trot

  dogged desperation goaded him and
as he pressed on he watched for signs
of the evil curse of nyua to strike at him
in some devilish way or another oddly no
manner of new trouble confronted him it
was as though the cruel jungle god had
turned from him to follow the nglanas

  he was still pondering over the startling
fact some hours past noon as he trekked
nearer and nearer to bwallas stronghold
until all at once he heard the sound of
chanting voices in the trail before him he
recognized the chant-the hunting song of
the guntalis

  he flung himself wildly into the bush
beside the trail and hunched there breath-
less he watched a party of six guntali
warriors file past

  it told him he was perilously close to
their village now he would have to watch
himself for capture would defeat any op-
portunity of saving jane

  presently with infinite caution he
emerged from the damp ferny under-
growth and re-entered the trail he was
wondering about grimm-if the mine man-
ager had gotten into the vicinity yet

  and then there was a crashing in the
undergrowth beside the trail near him he
jerked spun wildly around but it was no
guntali warrior that came lunging out of
the fronds it was lakeeto

  kirk gasped when he saw him lakeeto
was staggering and spent his broad heav-
ing chest was a mass of crimson and in-
sects covered the blood like a grayish mat

  lakeeto kirk blurted and caught
hold of the black hunter to steady him
lakeeto what   

  lakeetos sweat-dripping body was
trembling the black man had to struggle
to speak and when he found his voice it
was no more than a gasping painful whis-
per

  bwana i have learned - the truth
nyua is nothing your dearest companion
is a murderer-a betrayer- his voice
broke off his knees sagging beneath his
the jungle of charred corpses	

weight he fell to the ground and lay
horribly motionless

  lakeeto  cried kirk stooping down
to him and then he saw the faithful
black hunter was dead

  and he saw more the wound in la-
keetos breast was that of a rifle bullet

kirk straightened up his brown face
bleak it meant that lakeeto had not
been slain by a guntali nor was it credi-
ble that one of the nglanas had shot him
kirk was convinced that the bullet had
come from a white mans gun-the si-
lenced gun of the same vicious white mur-
derer who had been slaying the guntali
hunters for some personal reason

  and lakeeto had said the murderer was
kirks dearest companion a betrayer who
could-

  before kirk could reason this out the
six guntali hunters leaped from the bush
on all sides of him they were greatly
angered and fell upon him without mercy
he was bound with strips of tonga bark
and dazed and bruised was dragged up the
trail in the direction of their village

  being taken at last to their circular vil-
lage the people of guntali milled round
him as he was dragged to the base of the
huge grotesque idol of nyua which stood
in the center of their compound they
jeered and spit on him until all at once
their naked ranks opened up a path for
the tall stalwart black man who came
striding up among them it was bwalla
their king

  the guntalis stood motionless silent as
bwalla stepped alongside of kirk and
stared down at him bitterness and hate
lay in the kings steady gaze

  i am a just man bwana he said i
have not forgotten the good you and your
golden-haired wife have more than once
done for my people therefore when an-
other of my hunters fell before the noise-
less flaming spear of your ghost-demon i
did not call forth nyua as i threatened
nor did i when a second hunter fell but
today when a third of my hunters was
slain by your ghost-demon my patience
was at an end

  i instructed my hunters to search the
bush and find a person of white skin so
that we might have a victim for the cere-
mony of fire which will bring nyua out

of his holy grave the victim they cap-
tured is you-and that is good because
you are the leader of all white men in this
country it will be through your death that
all whites will suffer and die by the wrath
of nyua for the wrongs they have done
unto our tribe

  kirk stared up at bwalla his mind a
whirlpool of wild thinking nyua was sup-
posedly still secure in his grave-yet the
grave actually was a yawning hole and
the terrible horrors of the ancestor-god
wrere abroad in tembu-loma jane plain-
ly had not been captured by the guntalis
and taken here because then the hunters
would not have been sent out to search
for a victim and lakeeto going to enlist
joe grimms aid had been shot to death
but dying had managed to reach kirk to
say i have learned the truth nyua is
nothing your dearest companion is a mur-
derer-a betrayer-

  it sent the truth screaming through
kirks brain for the first time

greed can drive men till they become
inhuman beasts and greed obviously
lay behind all the evil that had befallen
tembu-loma

  listen to me people of guntali he
cried desperately i have seen the horrors
of nyua stalking this country for his
grave is empty i have seen men die of
fire that does not bum the grass at their
feet it is not nyuas work however be-
cause bwalla has not called your great god
forth it is the work of an evil white man
who means that i should die and that you
should be blamed for it he cares nothing
for the lives he takes he is merely inter-
ested in my mines which will make him
rich among white men

  listen to me people of guntali-if you
will follow i will lead you to this evil man
we will see that this man is brought to
his death for the many murders he has
committed

  the multitude gathered about him stood
unmoving as he paused their startled eyes
turned toward their king there was no
bewilderment in bwallas level gaze but
only the gray cloud of bitterness and dis-
illusionment

  think you that we are fools bwana
he said think you that we would let
ourselves be lured by lying words into a
	jungle

trap where your ghost-demon can slay
us no-i have my own plans with the
timely birth of the new moon after dark-
ness comes i shall give you unto our
sacred ceremony

  then abruptly he turned and stalked
away

   with his going the people of guntali
no longer subjected the prisoner to indigni-
ties apparently a chosen victim for the
fire ceremony was to be avoided and
they drifted away leaving kirk to lie in
his helplessness beneath the baleful un-
winking gaze of the crude-carved image of
nyua

   the heat of the sun was like a molten
curtain of brilliance shining down upon
marty kirk yet the sun was no more
incandescent than the rage that blazed in
his soul

  greed had plainly turned joe grimm
from folly to madness-a complete vicious-
ness that had brought about all this mur-
derous business and kirk could visualize
grimms scheme to cause the guntalis to
rise up against the whites by slaying their
hunters mysteriously-probably aided by
a few of his unscrupulous mine workmen
-with a silenced rifle in the uprising
marked by the curse of nyua-horror ef-
fects which grimm had somehow learned
to imitate-both kirk and jane would be
killed

  the governor-general would send sol-
diers and the guntalis would be driven
out of tembu-loma grimm then could
gain possession of the rich tin mine secure
with the governor-general believing that
the kirks had died at the guntalis hands

  kirk strained his muscular power
against the bonds that secured him curs-
ing that he should stumble upon grimms
perfidy too late grimm had jane impris-
oned somewhere if he hadnt already
killed her and kirk himself would die
horribly at the birth of the new moon
that night

   he lay back helpless panting realizing
the futility of struggle against the cords
which restrained him

   it obviously was the end of the trail
for him and his rage burned even more
hotly not that he was afraid to die
rather it sickened him that he was power-
less to prevent grimm from succeeding in
his inhuman plans

orturing hours ground slowly by
beneath the cruel blaze of the sun
they were hours made even more excru-
ciating by kirks terrible helpless thinking
and after what seemed an eternity the
sun sank to the west and his tight blood-
shot eyes watched the creeping fingers of
night lifting into the sky

  in that instant warriors paced into the
circular compound carrying a scaffolding
of peeled poles and setting it up before the
towering image of nyua other warriors
brought forth a great iron cauldron rais-
ing it up to the top of the scaffolding and
fastening it from the manner with which
the men handled the cauldron kirk
guessed it was brimming with some kind
of dangerous liquid

  what is this device he asked

  the answering warriors laugh was a
harsh grating sound he said mockingly
it is for your death at the birth of the
moon you will be suspended midway be-
tween the top and bottom of the scaffold-
ing and the potion will be poured over
your body burning the life out of you
the potion in this pot was brewed of the
sap of the fire-bush one drop of it is as
deadly as an ember fanned to white heat
kirk lay stiffly staring perspiration
wetted his face as he realized that the cere-
mony of fire was not merely the stake
but the gruesome death of having poured
over him a devilish searing escharotic
which had been brewed to perhaps ten
times the burning power of hydrochloric
acid yet his gaze remained defiant as he
stared at the black men

  king bwalla and all people of guntali
are fools he gritted you do not seem
to realize that my death will bring hosts
of white warriors from the coast tembu-
loma will run red with the blood of the
guntali slain

  let the white warriors come boasted
the black nyua will be abroad in the
bush then with fire and destruction they
will die before they even reach our kraal
kirk snorted nonsense i see now that
men stricken by that mystery fire that does
not char the earth are not victims of your
god but of living guntalis who strike
down the victims and pour over them this
potion you have here you merely use
the jungle of charred corpses	

tricks to frighten enemies into believing
nyua stalks the bush you are not magi-
cians but tricksters

  you are wrong the warrior replied
the fire and destruction of nyua are
real our potion here is but an imitation
of his holy works nothing is as powerful
as nyua and he turned back to his com-
panions who were fastening up the raw-
hide thongs that would hold kirk helpless
in the scaffolding

  loose the white man from his bonds
and strip him of his garments one of
them said to him that is the law of the
ceremony of fire

  wah nodded the warrior he roughly
jerked kirk to his feet with a flip of his
knife he slashed the tonga strips

  and in that split-second of freedom
marty kirk made his break it was all
nerve and no sense the desperate move
of a man goaded by the instinct for self-
preservation

he crashed his head hard into the chin
of the man beside him bent down and
went plunging through the group about
him like a streaking fullback and all the
people in the village caught sight of his
escape a great roar rose up from them
and they surged at him from every side

  he kept on like a plunging bullet that
nothing short of a spear or arrow might
stop in fact he was expecting it for such
would be a more pleasant death than being
seared alive

  but no spear was shafted at him in a
mad wave of hope he realized that they
wanted to keep him alive for this gruesome
sacrifice-offering to their jungle god

  only a miracle brought him safely to
the jungles edge and he plunged into the
dripping frondiferous undergrowths of the
bush with a dozen guntalis at his heels
he ran wildly changing directions back-
tracking never pausing a moment for
breath in this desperate effort to escape
from these black men

  the jungle seemed alive with guntalis
signal drums spoke to one another as the
blacks searched on every side of him he
was drenched with sweat his breathing
was a harsh painful panting and while he
fled this direction and that he felt sure
that all his efforts would come to nothing
too great odds were against him to facili-
tate a complete escape

  yet after the passage of two hours
when he paused in a fern-bed his sodden
clothing rent and tattered from the thorny
growths of the forest he realized that fate
had played on his side the sound of pur-
suit the maddening thump of signal drums
were gone and all he heard was the end-
less chorus of the jungle insects in the
darkness somewhere off to his left a
lion roared its challenge as it stalked the
bush for prey

  he ignored the danger of the prowling
lion for hope was reborn within him by
this incredible escape from burning death
and he saw the one task before him he
had to get to joe grimm and force a con-
fession of all his evil works out of him and
then march him as a prisoner back to the
bungalow residence where by this time
the soldiers from the coast must be wait-
ing the entire group could trek to the
guntali kraal and peace and sanity could
then be reestablished in tembu-loma

  the night was a pressing curtain of
blackness yet the stars overhead were
bright glowing glancing at them through
an opening he found in the treetops he
reckoned his direction tired and worn-
out as he was he set off toward the not-
far-distant tin mine at a trot

  the jungle along this way was not as
thickly grown and he was able to make
good time lashed with anxiety over janes
safety plus a burning desire for vengeance
against this man he had long trusted he
moved swiftly in less than four hours he
was standing upon a rise that commanded
a complete view of the shallow basin
where lay his tin mine

  the basin was a murky sea of darkness
with no light showing yet he knew the
mine lay directly below him with grimms
cottage on the one side of it and the settle-
ment of nglana workmen upon the other
at this late hour everyone likely would be
asleep in their beds

  carefully he worked his way down the
slope and soon he was standing before the
darkened cottage where grimm lived for
a full three minutes he stood rigid there
fists clenched then at last he walked for-
ward in the direction of the cottage stoop
pausing there again to listen

  no sounds came through the screen door
of the one-room cottage reaching out to
the door he noiselessly opened it and
stepped inside he listened for the noise of
	jungle

breathing from the sleeping bunk and
hearing nothing he was caught with a sud-
den wave of apprehension what if grimm
was not here but was somewhere out in
the jungle

  he remembered the electric lantern
standing on the table in the center of the
room and he switched it on

  the bright light dazzled his eyes mo-
mentarily but after he turned to the
bunk he halted in his tracks he stared
unbelievingly his theory of grimms guilt
tumbling down on his head like a mocking
house of cards

  joe grimm lay in the bunk-a burnt
and horribly charred corpse

vi

kirk was too bewildered too smitten
to think rationally who could have
done this who after all was the inhu-
man monster that killed and killed again
so wantonly was it one of the other
white prospectors or   

  come with me bwana for i have
something to show you spoke a familiar
voice from the doorway

  kirk whirled and saw the black naked
figure of bori the nglana chief standing
there bori had a-rifle gripped in his hands
and a bleak expression hardened his smooth
black features

  bori kirk gritted what are you
doing here

  that will be explained later bzuana
come with me to the native workmens set-
tlement here and you will learn the truth

  kirk stared at him a long moment
things werent right in his confused mind
still he had always trusted bori he
walked to the door and silently followed
the chief out into the dark night

  as they filed past the mine he saw
much activity in the nglana settlement a
great fire had been kindled in the com-
pound and natives moved to and fro they
seemed keyed up excited

  and after he drew nearer the compound
kirk saw something else a white woman
was standing beside the kindled fire she
was golden-haired resolute shapely it
was jane his wife-alive

  he ran to her caught her in his arms
and held her fast the tight quiver in his
throat dried up the rush of words that
welled up within him

stories

  jane clung to him desperately her voice
was strained and hopeless when she spoke
marty-oh heavens marty--what is to
become-of us

  us he pushed her back to arms
length and looked deep into the terrible
fear and horror he saw etched in her hol-
low eyes nothing is going to happen to
us now the soldiers must have already
reached tembu-loma and with their help
well-

  his voice choked off when the full in-
tensity of her hopelessness penetrated him
he turned his eyes from her and saw
the dozen nglanas who stood in a circle
about them there was no friendship upon
the faces of these black men their rifles
were raised the muzzles pointed squarely
and threateningly at him

  he stood stiffly unmoving these were
the jungle men whom he had educated into
the knowledge of the white way of life he
saw now it had become a dangerous knowl-
edge-knowledge that they had learned to
use to their own brutal purpose instead
of being devoted to him as he had long
believed they were devoted only to them-
selves

  what insanity is this he cried at
chief bori i have always believed you
my devoted companion and now i find
you are turned into a treacherous beast
is it treachery for us to want our own
homeland back again bori asked evenly
are we beasts because we mean to drive
the cursed guntalis to their destruction
this inhuman work will merely bring
your own destruction retorted kirk
you cannot commit murder after murder
and go unpunished

  chief bori laughed flatly with a brazen
gesture he brought out the silencer he had
stolen from kirks store-house and at-
tached it to his rifles muzzle

he looked steadily into the white mans
face

  no one will brand us as murderers
bori jeered bwana grimm showed us
the way to bring this all about

  so he was in this with you after all
in a way that is so explained bori
ever since you made him manager of
this mine he chided his nglana workmen
for believing that the guntalis used a risen
corpse to destroy our power they asked
him to prove it otherwise he took up the

challenge and made friends of various
guntalis so that he could visit their village
and slyly wrest from them some of their
secrets

  he learned that the stench of the
swamp is caused by wassa grass falling
into the water giving off vile odors when
it rotted-and that the guntalis produce
the stench wherever they choose by carry-
ing sealed pots of the rotting grass in
swamp water opening and closing the
cover of the pot as they will he learned
that our village guards were first struck
down unconscious then burned to death by
pouring a potion made of the boiled sap
of the fire-brush over them-a trick not
only to inspire fear in us but to give them
a chance to steal into our sleeping kraal
to poison our cooking pots

  i was filled with rage when this news
was brought to me continued bori it
made me vow to destroy the guntalis for
using this vile trickery against us

  and you stole that silencer to murder
innocent guntali hunters so that bwalla
and his people would be inflamed against
all white men growled kirk you knew
bwalla in vengeance would throw the
nyua curse upon us and by imitating his
tricks killing whites you would make the
governor-general absolutely believe the
guntalis were the guilty ones and he would
drive them out of the bush with the power
of his soldiers

  that is true nodded bori most of
us have been anxious to regain the rule of
tembu-loma-all except your houseboys
lakeeto and his man-child gawai and
gawais six young companions who were
steadfast to your white ways we did not
tell them our plans choosing them rather
as people to die

  but if grimm knew how these guntali
tricks were done why did he not tell me
so when you began your tricks kirk
asked

  because he was a greedy man was the
reply he happened to overhear some of
his workmen discussing our plans and he
came to me saying that if i allowed him
to get possession of your mine he would
not reveal our intentions to you i prom-
ised and he was the one who suggested
my men steal your wife telling us that
surely you would go out to rescue her from
the guntalis

stories

  sure sneered kirk because id take
you along and you could heighten the
guntalis guilt by nyua horror tricks and
you could desert me so the guntalis could
capture and murder me he told you my
charred body in the guntali kraal would
be absolute proof right

  bori nodded and when we left you
and started for this mine settlement we
overtook lakeeto and killed him

  just as you murdered grimm with the
burning potion when you reached here
so that no living person would know you
nglanas are murderers and betrayers of
my trust let me say to you bori you
will not succeed in your evil work the
white soldiers-

  the soldiers themselves will prove our
innocence scoffed the chief white mea
know that only guntalis are able to burn
victims without scorching the earth after
we return soon to your settlement the
houseboys charred bodies will be proof of
a guntali uprising the finding of other
charred bodied on the trail-including yours
and that of your wife-the soldiers will be
enraged they will destroy the guntalis
and tembu-loma will become ours again

e turned and spoke to two of his
men beside him he said go now
and bring out the urns of fire liquid we
have brewed we must get all things done
quickly

  we have long been your friends bori
jane entreated the chief as the men paced
away on their errand is it just that you
kill us in such an inhuman way

  bori gazed at her unfeelingly are your
lives more important than the honor of the
nglana nation

  they are more important than your
cheap little ambitions bori yelled kirk
and with a sweep of his hand that caught
the chief by surprise he ripped the rifle
from boris grasp as he fired from a hip
position the silenced muzzle made a
whooshing sound as he shot bori squarely
in the head then he swung the gun at
the horde of remaining nglanas

  the shocked stunned blacks fell back
before the fury of his noiseless fire but
it was only momentary their rifles came
up and kirk knew that he and jane were
to be slaughtered by a fusillade from which
there was no escape
the jungle of

  yet not one shot was fired for as if
by an incredible miracle the firelighted
compound suddenly became alive with
streaking arrows nglanas fell one upon
another as feathered shafts skewered their
black bodies those who survived strove to
fight back against this menace from the
jungle grove that partially circled the settle-
ment but they could not shoot against an
enemy they could not see nor could they
protect themselves in the open fire-bright
compound

  jane clung terrified to kirk as the com-
pound turned into a welter of bodies-a
place made more terrible by the frenzied
cries of the nglanas who sought to flee
from a doom from which there was no
escape and where every man had fallen
a large company of guntali warriors-their
war-bows still in their grasp - emerged
from the jungle grove

  king bwalla was among them he came
up abjectly before kirk bowing his head
to him in shame

  i am a pig in thy sight bwana he
said if it were not for the hand of nyua
that gave you the chance to escape my
kraal i would have sacrificed the body of
a friend to the ceremony of fire

  you atoned for all that by saving me
from the hands of these mad nglanas
kirk responded

  rage brought me here-not a desire
to aid you bwalla said after you
escaped and the men returned to our kraal

charred corpses



i reasoned that you would set out here to
gain the aid of bwana grimm i led my
men here and we arrived as bori and you
came into this firelighted compound we
were about to overwhelm you when bori
spoke and revealed his evil work and the
soundless flaming spear you snatched from
his hand proved that the deaths of my
hunters was caused by bori - not by a
white-man demon so i signaled my men
to slay all but these and thy golden-haired
wife

  he touched kirk in the guntali gesture
of reverence

  i have learned the one great truth
bwana that you are still our brother
and that white man works are good your
enemies henceforth will be our enemies
and tembu-loma will prosper in peace i
swear it by the name of holy nyua

  it will be so solemnly nodded kirk

  thus it was when dawn began streaking
the eastern sky that kirk and jane trekked
their solitary way through the jungle fast-
ness toward the main trail that would lead
them back to their settlement and home
though the horror and bitterness of their
experiences still clung to them they both
were conscious of a feeling of contentment

  the greed and petty ambitions of ruth-
less men had won them the complete
friendship of the guntalis it gave promise
of a lasting peace in tembu-loma and the
ultimate conquest of its virgin wilderness

  they had never asked for more than that
black mahogany

by don cushman

a fortune in black wood-for any man with skin tough enough to shed
barbed arrows whose stomach could hold poisoned drinks without shrivel-
ing whose heart was cold enough to resist treacherous seeva the dancing
girl a treasure in black mahogany-for armless oneil-if he could live

long enough to take it

siesta time and coquilhatville
bleached in the equatorial sun
nothing moved along its rammed-
earth streets even the chickens scrawny
african birds of which coquilhatville must
have owned a hundred thousand had
ceased their interminable scratching to
crouch with bills wide in every patch of
shade it was the time of day when things
stood still life suspended-when even the
officials of the colonial administration
stopped cursing the bureaucrats of leopold-
ville and slept in long reed chairs

  the sound of a riverboat whistle vibrat-
ing flatly over the fly drone of the after-
noon at first produced no quiver of life
finally the insect-proof door of lhotel
cambyse swung open and a man appeared

  he was white or perhaps caucasian
would be the word for him as the tropic
suns of three continents had long since
turned his skin the hue of a bronze
buddah he was under average in height
more than average in breadth and from
the left sleeve of his wrinkled linen jacket
protruded a steel hook which flashed in
the sun as he walked along

  as nearly anyone from cairo to the
cape could tell you this picturesquely ugly
man was armless oneil

  armless oneil sighted the steamboat
its size distorted by the heat waves which
rebounded from the congo and judged
his speed so their arrival at the dock
exactly coincided

  the boat cut her paddle swung in a
gentle arc against the current and shiv-
ered to rest against the fermenting timbers
a senegalese tied her fast and the plank
banged ashore oneil impatiently scanned
the passengers

  fifteen alighted - two belgian clerks



home from a celebration in leopoldville
or the more voluptuous dives of brazza-
ville across the pool a woman missionary
whose skin was just recovering from the
peeling stage and twelve assorted natives

  oneil cursed due to the proximity of
the woman missionary he confined his
profanity strictly to german egyptian and
congoese when the woman looked at him
with a little surprise he tipped his sun
helmet and said

  excuse me

  yes she evidently thought he had a
question so he asked

 madame was there a young man
named tommy huston aboard

  im not certain what did he    
hes a dissolute neer - do - well fiddle
player who hit cairo with a yankee dance
band seven years ago and never got home
hes a braggart and a liar and he has
delusions of being the don juan of dakar
and all points east

  no she answered a trifle huffily
im certain theres no such person
aboard

  oneil cursed in choice spanish and
started back up the street instead of going
to the hotel he turned and followed a
board sidewalk which led by a series of
apparently purposeless curves to a much-
added-to structure with a red sheet-metal
roof the sign over the door of this place
had long since been corroded a grayish
blank by the tropics inevitable fungus but
the stale wine odor which emanated was
sufficient to indicate its character

  he passed through a screened veranda
to the interior which was long and dim
and cluttered with tables two persons
were in sight - an insignificant little
englishman who sat disconsolately at a
there was a mighty vibrating roar and the roadbed rocked beneath them


	jungle

side table and a native who slept on the
floor a breeze from some remote recess
of the building felt actually cool so oneil
took a place in the breath of it and waited
when no one appeared he beat on the
table with his hook arm

  cognac he shouted

   the proprietor a tall moroccan sat up
in his hammock behind the bar and took
note of the one-man uproar

  said oneil feisal you dog of a be-
liever how does an irish catholic get
himself service in this heathen sump-
hole

teisal whose name was actually

  jl mohammed kadir approached softly
on tennis shoes and bowed with the mos-
lem salute

   master your thirst must be the thirst
of ten thousand martyrs that you knock
chips from my costly tables during the hour
of rest

  to hell with you said oneil and
to hell with your tables too bring me
cognac french cognac-and ice

  ice behold he asks for ice these
six days we have had not a fragment and
now they say it must be twelve days more
until that unblessed camshaft of your infidel
freezing machine has its bearings brazed
in leopoldville-

   ill settle for cognac and a bottle of
water

  mohammed bowed backing toward the
bar

  and make sure its french get it
french

  when the cognac came it was cheap
spanish oneil tasted it and spat

  this is no cognac

  behold the label it says-

  oneil threatened with his hook call
this cognac this kerosene-

  ten thousand prayers master i am
your slave but  mohammed spread
his hands helplessly what with the new
administrator the duties the taxes it
used to be one complained of malaria and
ants now it is taxes malaria and ants
may a curse rest on that dog of an admin-
istrator through the ninety and nine cities
of hell for bringing on us this plague of
taxes

  oneil poured himself a drink and was
contemplating it when he noticed the little

stories

englishman approaching from his side
table

  excuse me the englishman said
apologetically but i happened to overhear
your conversation with the proprietor and
it just so happens that i have a bottle of
good whisky he opened an alligator-skin
valise and drew out a tall bottle i dont
drink strong liquor myself but i do carry
some for medicine

  bushmills gasped oneil sit down
mr-

  wentworth elwood wentworth
  oneil

  they shook hands

  believe me mr wentworth you should
never prefer water to whisky here in the
tropics without whisky the whites would
never hold out through the next rainy
season

  youve been here a long time

  too damned long

  then youre perhaps familiar with the
concessions

  a few

  now mahogany-

  never knew a man who made a paper
franc in it

  oh dear said mr wentworth

  say you havent been sucked in on a
mahogany deal

  it isnt quite that 

  oneil disposed of one glass of bush-
mills and poured another mr went-
worth just settle back and tell me all
about it

  mr wentworth breathed deeply after the
manner of a careful man beginning a
lengthy story

  it all started when uncle geoffrey
came to visit me at my flat in chatham
chatham is near london quiet you
understand but just the place for a rest
im not married you know never hav-
ing-

  sure said oneil

  uncle geoffrey said it would be an
ideal place for him to get over some tropical
fever that he called the the blackwater
not that i minded at all you understand
it was rather nice having someone around
when i got through at the office even
though he did borrow money from me
sure oneil encouraged him pouring
bushmills

  finally though he got to borrowing
black mahogany	

quite a bit and what was worse he spent
it all on liquor and-well to be frank
mr oneil uncle geoffrey took to seeing
things

  snakes

  yes and worse oh ill tell you we
had some interesting times especially when
uncle geoffrey saw the crocodiles

  i can imagine

  i hate to say it but it was almost a
mercy when he passed away    but
before he did he gave me something
a deed to the concession

  well a sixty per cent share which was
all of bondele that he owned but there
was something else

mr wentworth opened his
valise again this time pulling out a
little wooden box ingeniously fitted to-
gether and hinged without a screw or peg
it was obviously the product of african
craftsmen its surface had been smoothed
down by ese leaves and rubbed with goats
wool until it had an oily luster of great
beauty one of the most striking features
of the box however was its color
although its peculiar interlocking fiddle-
back grain stamped it as african mahogany
it was darker than most ebony oneil
lifted the cover and glanced inside it
contained a dried bats wing

  gri-gri he asked

  yes it was his charm against the devil
of disease as he called it mr went-
worth was a trifle breathless did you
noticethe drill hole thats where a wood
dealer in london tested to see if the color
was solid throughout he said that natural
mahogany of that color is worth a-
mr wentworth if you could lumber
any amount of heartwood of this quality
youd be rich now this cedrelas-thats
what it is of course no true mahogany
grows in africa - this cedrelas naturally
runs from red to orange but give it a
soaking in dilute sulphuric acid dry it
give it a shot of copperas and ammonia
result--wood black like this box
then you dont think any wood like
this grows on the concession

  not a sliver

  oh my said mr wentworth almost
in tears

  the best thing you could do is go
home

  but i do so hate to leave without even
going out to visit bondele

  hovent you even been out to the con-
cession

  i started i hired four natives to pad-
dle me there in a dugout canoe and-
mr wentworth leaned across the table
when we were only a few miles beyond
chapleauville somebody shot a poisoned
arrow at me

  oneil cleared his throat mr went-
worth you havent been taking atabrine
to ward off the fever have you

  mr wentworth started to answer but
instead he dug once again into the con-
tents of the alligator-skin valise with a
triumphant movement he unrolled a strip
of wrapping paper and allowed an arrow
to fall to the table it was the regular
native article about eighteen inches long
tipped with a triangular trade barb the
forward portion of the shaft smeared with
a black viscous substance resembling coffee
extract

  oneil sniffed the black stuff what
then 

  well naturally i turned back when

i	reached chapleauville i hired some
natives to deliver a message to uncle
geoffreys partner telling him i was there
and that i wanted him to send his launch
three weeks i waited without receiving
an answer so i came back here he
tapped the table impressively now the
question is why didnt he send for me
drunk yawned oneil or dead
youd be surprised what little trouble it
is to die in africa

  well the old partner is dead mr
ladue he sold out to mr marinez
pablo marinez the portugee 

  yes

  go home to chatham go by the next
boat i wouldnt have marinez for a part-
ner if you gave me all the gold in
jo-han

  oh dear said mr wentworth

  in the midst of the little mans despair
the insect-proof door squeaked open and
slapped shut a tall young man strode
across the room

  oneil

  tommy cried oneil forgetting the
quandary of mr wentworth i was down
to meet the boat but there were you 
sorry grinned tommy but my siesta


wasnt quite complete when we docked

  when the greetings were over oneil
became stern

  whats this about you making that
cape town jail

  tommy dismissed the cape town jail
with a snap of his fingers and sniffed the
bushmills a-a-h

  oneil shouted feisal - another
glass then we have this fine liquor
through the courtesy of mr wentworth
tommy huston meet mr wentworth
mr wentworth im glad to meet you
exclaimed tommy as though meeting mr
wentworth had been his lifelong ambi-
tion

  now what was it about that cape
town jail asked oneil

  oh that you see i started back to
the states just like i promised when you
staked me but i ran into a dutchman by
the name of van ruh and he had an idea
we start a mining concern sneak into
namaqualand and wait for the government
to run us out then we carry it to the
courts publicity see if the stockholders
in the diamond monopoly ever found out
about the tons of stones lying around in
namaqualand boom  to hell goes the stock
result - the monopoly doesnt want the
publicity so they buy us off

  legal blackmail moaned oneil
well what went wrong

that damned van ruh turned yellow
and skipped leaving me in that jail
wishing to change the subject tommy
examined the little box whats this
oneil told him

  mahogany gasped tommy black
cripes mr wentworth do you know what
this stuff is worth

  mr oneil has just convinced me its
not worth much of anything

  sternly oneil you have the gall to
describe me as a blackmailer while all the
time youre drinking this good mans liquor
and trying to talk him out of his
mahogany

  tommy listen you take this cedrelas
dry it soak it in sulphuric acid dry it
again give it a shot of copperas and am-
monia it turns black simple

  simple its idiotic sulphuric acid
and copperas tommy poured another
drink mr wentworth youre a fortunate
man i happened in just when i did not

that oneils a crook-hes just plain
dumb never sees business possibilities
in things now tell me where this black
wood came from

  mr wentworth told when he had fin-
ished tommy nodded

  sure they shoot poisoned arrows at
you why mr wentworth ill tell you
why this marinez fellow has probably
murdered ladue and now hes trying to
drive you away so he can hog the black
mahogany all for himself

  oneil said tommy youre not doing
the little guy any favor when you talk that
way a stray arrow a wood process job
mix it up with two shots of liquor and
bingo-youre the mahogany king of the
belgian congo

ii

tommys eyes chanced to rove to the
scars which oneils hook had carved
in the table top the table was mahogany
and where the fresh wood was exposed it
was almost as dark as the wood of the
box

  whered this mahogany come from
he asked mohammed

  perhaps from above chapleauville
beyond that i cannot say

  tommy whacked the table above
chapleauville thats where the conces-
sion is located and that settles it

  mr wentworth spent the next minutes
doing some thinking at last he spoke
im a trifle helpless all by myself my
experience you see now if i had some
partners experienced ones-

  mr wentworth youre not asking us
to go in on the deal

  well if you didnt mind id gladly
relinquish half my interest that is for a
small consideration   

  sold said tommy how much do
you want

  well i already have better than a
hundred pounds in the venture including
what i lent to uncle geoffrey it would be
close to two hundred but ill part with
half my sixty per cent for say-do you
think one-hundred twenty-five pounds
would be exorbitant

  tommy waved a careless hand a hun-
dred and twenty-five she is just put it
in writing

jungle stories

        
black mahogany	

  mr wentworth put it in writing
tommy held out his palm to oneil

  would you mind lending me my half
till a later date

  to hell with you said oneil
oneil doesnt friendship mean any-
thing to you

  sure but not a hundred and twenty-
five pounds sterling listen tommy you
fiddle-playing fat-head youve put me over
the riffles for the last time oh i have
the dough all right ive got four thou-
sand francs right here in my moneybag
but its not going to be used to pay off
uncle geoffreys whisky debts im using
it to get out of this stinking country im
going to take it back to good old chicago
and open me a billiard parlor

  a poolroom asked tommy as though
nauseated

  a poolroom

  tommy said go home mr went-
worth to hell with you and your million-
dollar mahogany it wouldnt pay out
labors too high ten cents a day
besides oneil gets itchy between the
shoulderblades when he thinks of poisoned
arrows and he doesnt want to tangle
with marinez either no hed rather be
snug and safe in chi playing kelly-pool
oneil cursed and banged down a fist-
ful of belgian treasury notes ill pay
ninety pounds and not a damned cent
more

  of course if thats all its worth  
its a hell of a lot more than its worth
shouted oneil   

  at one time the department of colonies
poured many millions of francs into devel-
opment of the ncimbo river country it
built docks and lorry roads and even a
hundred and fifty kilometers of narrow-
gauge railroad lines hoping thus to
encourage the production of rubber palm
nuts and mahogany but that had been
fifteen or twenty years before and when
armless oneil tommy huston and mr
wentworth rode up the ncimbo in a dug-
out canoe little evidence of the colonial
departments enterprise remained

  now and then they would pass a frag-
ment of dock jutting into the sluggish cur-
rent or a metal-roofed shed making its
last stand against rust fungus and ter-
mites and then the jungle would close

-jungle stories-spring

in its great trees arching beneath their
weight of parasitic vines and the royal
expenditure would seem puny indeed

  the town of chapleauville nearest trad-
ing post to the bondele concession also
seemed to be losing in its struggle against
the jungle once a week they were told
the town was enlivened by the departure
of the tea-kettle locomotive which made a
fifty-kilometer run along the weavy road-
bed of a narrow-gauge to conform with
colonial regulation but this did not take
place during the day they spent there

  above chapleauville mr wentworth
became extremely jumpy a dozen times
he sat straight with apprehension and
said

  gentlemen it was in a place just like
this i was sitting just like i am right
now when suddenly there was a flash
-and the next instant that poisoned arrow
was quivering in the side of the canoe

  and each time he said this oneil would
look so magnificently bored that mr went-
worth almost hoped somebody would shoot
a poisoned arrow and that that arrow
would come very very close to oneil
however nothing of the sort happened
and early the next morning they arrived
at bondele

during the boom days of mahogany
bondele had been prosperous its
resident manager lived regally in a large
plantation house with three wives of the
ngelewa tribe while three hundred black
men labored in mill and cutting grounds
but now the shrubbery of the jungle grew
rank in the roadway which ledfrom the
crumbling dock to the plantation build-
ings and herds of elephants had trampled
fences and garden plots

  oneil spent half an hour poking through
buildings examining the old squaring mill
the coils of wire rope now mostly brittle
with rust the little locomotive which sat
on a spur of the chapleauville line and
the caterpillar which praise allah had
been covered with an oiled tarp

  hello there oneil shouted over and
over trying to raise the caretaker if one
existed his only answer came from a
black ngila monkey which scolded him
from the balcony of the plantation house

  mr wentworth was at his wits end to
explain the abandonment mr marinez
	jungle

must be here some place he wouldnt

just pick up and go alter buying mr
ladues interest

  why not  i slapped ninety pounds
into this rust heap and fd like to pick
up and go

  tommy said cant you see youre hurt-
ing mr wentworths feelings

  to hell with mr wentworths feel-
ings and to hell with you too

  while they were speaking seven men
came in sight where the railroad spur
entered the jungle they advanced single
file between the rails the sunlight flashing
from the metal of the guns they carried
and from the tips of cartridges in the belts
which were slung across their naked shoul-
ders

  the man in the lead was a gigantic
senegalese with a heavy boned face and
eyes dull and savage as a great apes
unlike the others he did not wear the
common native hodge-podge of clothing
this fellow wore a sun helmet a linen shirt
without buttons linen trousers and a pair
of sandals that might have walked out of
the old testament

  oneil greeted him in senegalese but
he did not choose to answer all he did
was move his high-powered rifle around
to the crook of his arm and keep advancing
he stopped at a distance of a dozen paces
with his men ranged on either side

  what you doin on thees groun he
asked in an accent both african and
french

  we own it answered oneil serenely
  senior marinez hes own thees

  all right take us to senor marinez
  me motala take you

  yes you splay-footed son of a jack-
ass screamed oneil

  making a ceremony of the movement
motala released the safety of the rifle

  perhaps you theenk senor marinez
does not want i should shoot men who
come snooping on his concession  he
drew a bead on oneils temple and
then a little reluctantly he lowered the
rifle nex time i will fire it is my
word and motala keep his word he
smiled not pleasantly showing his strong
teeth like all natives he gloried in hav-
ing big talk against a caucasian he
whacked the stock of the rifle contemptu-
ously not that i need thees rifle not

stories

me who was champion wrestler of all
senegal he was bragging and rolling
his muscles for the benefit of the natives
who made up his little army

  oneil spat call that muscle come
here oh infidel pig and lay your womans
hand on an arm that could twist otf your
neck like a cockerels

  motala came forward but only a step or
two he stood looking at the sleeve of
oneils shirt with the muscle flexing be-
neath it suddenly tommys laugh broke
the tight-drawn silence

  behold the coward o mighty oneil
he dares not feel your muscle knowing he
will be proved a weakling

motala had no other course so he
swaggered forward and reached for
oneils bicep but when he came within
range oneils hook arm traveled in a short
arc connecting with motalas fingers where
they bent around the gun

  motala let the rifle fall and staggered
backward sucking his carved fingers
then with a bellow of rage he charged

  now when motala charged it was in-
evitable that his opponent retreated it
had always been thus and he came to
expect it but oneil was not the retreat-
ing kind on the contrary he advanced a
step this apparently insane action threw
motala off balance it took him a moment
to set himself for the mighty blow he had
intended he let it go but oneil was
inside

  motala was a set-up for an uppercut
but oneil didnt throw it instead his
hook arm found the opening at the front
of motalas linen trousers there was a
whir of buttons and the trousers fluttered
around his feet

  motala tried for one of his wrestlers
holds but oneil was out and away

  thrice son of a goat thy pants are
drooping

  motalas pants tangled and he sprawled
across the termite-eaten railroad ties
oneil tromped on his fingers motala
kicked his way out of the trousers but
by that time oneil had him covered with
the rifle

  awed by the manner in which oneil
had handled their leader the natives fled
and no shouting from motala could stop
them now take us to this marinez
black mahogany

commanded oneil moving rifle slightly
motala looked down the barrel and
caused no further trouble

  f-ilo marinezs plantation house
v was about five kilometers distant
it was a large place white painted with
a double veranda around all four sides
at the far edge of the clearing were forty
or fifty thatch and mud huts and down
by the dock were three metal-covered
warehouses in excellent repair a path of
white-washed cobbles led through the well-
trimmed garden to the house

  it was siesta time and nobody was
around in the shade of the veranda the
senegalese stopped and the prodding of
the rifle would make him go no further



  senor marinez will see no one during
the hour of siesta

  marinez bellowed oneil marinez
come out here

  there was movement in the deep shade
of the interior the sound of footsteps on
a matted floor and a hook-nosed man of
indeterminate near-east blood came out to
look at oneil and his companions with
black suspicious eyes

  shemeshal - these men -  motala
started but the hook-nosed man quieted
him with an impatient gesture he turned
to oneil and said

  you are welcome to the house of
marinez the greeting disposed of he
spoke sharply in senegalese motala why
in the name of the prophet do you bring

oneil came down on the senegalese with the hook
	jungle

these men here at this hour and what
is that hook-armed one doing with the
rifle i purchased you at the cost of twelve
hundred francs

  when motala hesitated oneil an-
swered your man got a little careless
with it so i took it away from him and
he brought us here because i kept its
muzzle in his back now call marinez
you must wait said the man called
shemeshal switching once again to
english this is siesta time and-
marinez damn you come here bel-
lowed oneil hammering at the door
casing with his hook arm

  shemeshal lifted his shoulders in an
arabian shrug which is perhaps the high-
est shrug on earth motala started to
withdraw

  your gun called oneil tossing the
rifle

  motala caught it and stood there look-
ing at oneil with his hate-filled unintel-
ligent eyes we will meet again hook
arm and when-

  go cried shemeshal

  oneil kept hammering marinez
marinez

  in half a minute or so marinez came
around the veranda walking in the rolling
manner which is so common with big
men in the tropics he was not bad look-
ing perhaps when young he had been
handsome his mustache was carefully
trimmed his hair clipped close to remove
all traces of gray his skin was oily ex-
tremely brown and spotted a little from
the prevalent tropic liver complaint

  who raises the dead by calling my
name he asked then seeing oneil
you i remember you and your hook
arm wait do not tell me marinez lies
never forget a name nor a face it was
on the steamboat dobondau we play
cards armless oneil-the same

  the same grinned oneil and they
shook hands he introduced the others
and marinez made them welcome

  you perhaps came over from uganda
he asked hopefully

  no

he expelled his breath in a manner which
could have indicated disappointment
but forgive it is the hosts duty to
pour brandy not make the question no
from the upper veranda they had a

stories

good view of the plantation there was
another clearing with more huts several
acres of cassava patch and older fields
now grown up to ochilla weed across the
river on rising ground was an area of
small parks where at one time or other
rubber trees had been planted in rows

  the veranda and the portion of the
interior which could be seen was excel-
lently furnished after the ornate east
nice place remarked oneil

  marinez nodded acknowledgment and
poured brandy and soda what was it
about motala  he asked did i not hear
you had some trouble with that dull-witted
senegalese 

  he tried to run us off our concession
  your concession

  bondele were the new owners your
partners i should say

mr wentworth spoke up
surely you received the messages i

sent

  please i know of no message no
partner except geoffrey clifton-

  he was my uncle when he died he
willed me this interest and i sold half of
it to these gentlemen

  dead alas what is it you english
say  - here yesterday gone tomorrow
gentleman may i propose a toast-
oneil lifted his glass heres to uncle
geoffrey and his crocodiles

  ho i do not get it but it is good
yes marinez drank so what do you
plan at bondele 

  to cut mahogany

  mahogany ah senhors there was once
perhaps money in mahogany but the day
she is gone you perhaps come with cap-
ital so you spend it and then you look
for more believe me the jungles of the
ncimbo drink money like the sands of
sahara drink a mans blood

  you seem to be doing all right smiled
oneil

  yes but not in mahogany with me
it is the palm nut and copal you have
read the miracles performed by the amer-
ican soap manufacturers with the palm
nut the secret of cleopatras perpetual
beauty imagine-and from our poor palm
nuts which the native used to spit away
after another drink marinez yawned
even good brandy and better company
black mahogany	

cannot deny me my rest if it please you
there are hammocks on the south-east
veranda or if you prefer liquor in the
cellar

ill

oneil slept for an hour and arose
in the druglike heat of afternoon to
wander around the plantation buildings
although several months had passed since
high water-the only time when steam-
boats could navigate this far up the silt-
filled ncimbo-there were only a couple
tons of palm nuts strewn across one of
the storehouse floors and in a corner of
another a few sacks of jackass copal
any trader with a ten-thousand-franc stock
of trade goods would have accumulated a
dozen times the value in a season

  last steamboat take away much palm
nuts copal oneil asked a native whom
he roused

  take little bring much

  much what

  what the master use--brandy tin-can
food big chair maybe nex time steam-
boat bring ice machine so i hear what
for is ice machine

  oneil tried to explain ice hard
water see cold put in whisky to give
bellyache

   ai-ai-ai cried the native thinking of
the folly of the white man who brought
in a machine to make the bellyache

  oneil went back to the house where he
found that tommy had awakened and
had tracked down marinezs supply of
liquor

  it doesnt add up oneil said pour-
ing a drink for himself now look at
this liquor - french twenty years old
worth a hundred francs a liter ill tell
you tommy marinez is in the deep dol-
lars

  sure palm nuts the secret of
cleopatra remember 

  secret of cleopatra be damned he
hasnt three tons of nuts on the place
last year he shipped next to nothing
yet here he is pouring hundred - franc
brandy and do you know what hes bring-
ing in -an ice machine

  tommy was thoughtful you dont
suppose he has his hooks into the black
mahogany he could be shipping it from

some place else making plenty too
it makes a man wonder admitted

oneil

  like many portuguese marinez enter-
tained in the grand manner after the
cool of night had settled supper was served
beneath hanging lamps in a screened patio
at the center of the building food in-
cluded roasted kid heaps of curried rice
a native salad of plantain banana and
boiled cassava drenched with palm-nut oil
there was dessert of canned peaches-and
above all liquor liquor and more liquor

  besides host and guests shemeshal was
there silent falcon-eyed he ate little
drank little and spoke little-but he list-
ened a great deal

  after dinner marinez leaned back in
his chair and asked what is your plan
at bondele

  like i said we plan to cut mahogany
answered oneil

  friends for two reasons you can make
no money first the market she is very
bad second only once a year can the
boat haul your wood away

  well raft it down

  not on the ncimbo it is too slow
sometimes the native say the ncimbo she
flow backward no senhors the mahogany
is no good

  then why did you buy ladues inter-
est in bondele

  because he was my friend and he neeed
the money

  i heard he needed money ladue had
a hard time keeping in liquor

  marinez smiled to indicate he got the
direction of oneils remark it had been
told from coquilhatville to nifowa how
manrinez had kept ladue drunk he ele-
vated his feet lighted an habana cigar
and looked at the stars enlarged by the
veil of mosquito netting as by a mist

  you know how it is with the white
man in our tropics senhor he comes
with great hopes to the new country he
sees its fertility the luxuriance like the
garden where eve went naked no
marinez wafted a kiss from the tips of his
thick fingers at the thought of eve going
naked then after one maybe three
years what  the mosquito has laid the
drug in his blood he takes quinine until
his teeth loosen and he hears bells in his
ears or else he takes atabrine which softens
	jungle

the brain it is hot he sweats but what
of that still the heat he sleeps and
grows bored the days are long one
cannot sietesta forever no so he drinks
at first half a bottle a day then a bottle
two bottles time goes on and he dies
he is buried in six months a year the
damp-rot has done its work and even his
bones they are gone then what is left
only a heap of old whiskey bottles to show
that a white man has come that way thus
the jungle senhors

marinez went on you are not rich
no yes it is as i guessed but you are
my friends i do not wish you should lose
what are you getting at  asked oneil
it is that i will make the princely offer
for bondele

how much

  say-one hundred thousand francs
translate that into dollars and you have
three thousand no

  marinez smiled recklessly generosity
and strong drink has made of me the fool
two hundred thousand francs

  no

  ah you are saving me the money
come drink senhor the bottom is the
most beautiful part of the glass is it not
so

the drinks marinez poured had been
very large and now they became larger
after a couple more he clapped his hands
for the servant and gave him a command
in a low voice soon three natives entered
two carrying tom-toms and the third a
balafron it took the balafron player a
while to set up and as he worked sheme-
shal became tense staring at the beaded
hangings of a doorway with cobra-like
intensely

  the music started with the tom-toms
being beaten in a peculiar rocking rhythm
after a while the balafron came in but
with different time than the tom-toms
this combined with its minor melody
giving to the whole a weird oscillating
effect

  the beaded hangings of the doorway
lifted and a woman came into the patio
her feet moving in a creeping half-dancing
step

  she was beautiful her profile was
egyptian her complexion of the upper
nile her teeth flashed white against the

stories

painted red of her lips her body was
strong and full of womanly suggestion be-
neath the webby veil of silk she wore

  mr wentworth leaned forward holding
his breath tommy whistled in low key and
finished his drink shemeshals eyes were
bright his nostrils distended marinez
leaned back in his chair and smiled with
owners pride and oneil was inscrutable

  the girl danced slowly her muscles flow-
ing with feline grace it was the leop-
ard dance of the white nile her feet
moved with the rhythm of the tom-
toms while her arms and body followed
the balafron despite this there was unity
in her dance like melody and counter-
melody in symphonic composition

  by minute degrees the dance mounted
in intensity the girl smiled contemplative
breathless through clenched teeth

  suddenly the broken rhythm ceased the
balafron and tom-toms strode forward in
unison the girls small creeping move-
ments vanished she danced swiftly around
the table whirling pausing momentarily at
the close of each revolution to impart an
oscillating effect to her silken veil

  faster and faster beat the time the eye
could not follow the hands of the beaters so
fast they went and the girl danced mount-
ing to the tempestuous moment which in
the leopard dance signifies the kill her
veils were a multi-colored blur mingled with
the brown skin of her body

  shemeshal breathless leaned forward at
the edge of his chair a strange trans-
formation had come over his face no
longer inscrutable his lips were twisted
with passion his eyes were wide with vast
amounts of white showing the muscles of
his neck were knotted as though by
catalepsy

  with a final thunder the tom-toms
stopped the girl whirled to the last plinks
of the belafron cried sharply in an unknown
tongue and beat her palms overhead the
dance was over and for the first time she
looked at the men around the table

  marinez shouted ho you like seeva
my dancing girl

  cripes exhaled tommy

  seeva came over her lithe brown body
glowing with suggestion she looked at
each man at shemeshal least of all and
scarcely breathing hard from her exertion
roosted on the table carelessly swinging
black mahogany



one leg she lit a cigarette inhaled to the
last cubic inch of her lungs and looked
down on tommy with eyes as soft as an
antelopes tommy lifted his glass to
drink but leaning quickly across she seized
his wrist and tilted the glass to her own
lips

  i have seen you some place yes she
asked

  me

  you have perhaps seen the dancing girls
at bushneveld

  i never saw a girl like you before
tommy said fervently

  oneil growled seeva get your elbow
out of my brandy

  she regarded oneil and asked tommy
thees ugly hook-arm man he is friend
of yours

  i put up with him tommy apologized
oneil said take it easy tommy-lad
or ill pack you up and ship you back to
coquilhatville

  now i have heem you will not take
heem away cried seeva accidentally
knocking over shemeshals brandy so that
it spilled in his lap shemeshal did not
seem to notice he just stared at her

  you bet he wont take me away agreed
tommy then in his best don juan style
did anybody ever tell you you were beau-
tiful baby

  oh allah moaned oneil

  seeve took tommy by the hand and
drew him away come weeth me i
weel show you the stars that shine on
bushneveld  

  tommy watch your step warned
oneil and-he wasnt fooling

  tommy hesitated he freed his hand
to pour another drink

  marinez laughed come let us all
drink senhors

  he stood a trifle drunkenly with his back
against a potted shoe palm which was kept
in the patio for its supposed power against
yellow fever

  come-see how beautiful is the bot-
tom of the glass you senhor oneil
why do you not drink  oh-ho  you
perhaps fear for jour young friend  why
do you not say go we are children
twice but we have youth but once  
oneil watched while seeva and tommy
strolled to the cool starlight of the veranda
when he looked back marinezs glass was

  empty empty-though he knew it had
never been lifted to his lips

  come up with the bottom roared
marinez

  sure oneil answered he walked
to the pot which held the shoe palm and
emptied the drink

  suddenly marinez was no longer tipsy
he licked his thick lips and spoke in a rather
husky voice

  believe me senhor i am sorry as
you see i have had enough still the host
must drink with guests no he lifted
his shoulders expressively and that is
why i poured the drink away

  sure grunted oneil his face the old
buddah mask

  marinez recognizing the nature of
oneils suspicion strode to the table and
lifted high the brandy bottle

 you suspect-many things dope
poison but watch

he poured a brimming gobletful and
took it in one magnificent gulp he poured
another and downed that and still another
at the end he inhaled with a mighty gasp
see i have prove myself no

good drinking marinez said oneil
conversation lagged for a while sheme-
shal watched the veranda without seeming
to be aware of anything that had happened

marinez broke the silence in a voice
which for him was singularly unani-
mated you are a suspicious man oneil
your suspicion is always with you it is
a way of life you see i am the judge of
character no you suspect me for pour-
ing liquor in my poor shoe palm you
suspect that i kept my friend ladue drunk
in order to gain his interest in bondele
but should not i have the suspicion too
have you told all senhor

  oneil watched shemeshal capture a
dragonfly and calmly pull its legs out one by
one

  marinez cried come senhor oneil
what is it makes bondele valuable
mahogany

  the bedrooms at cilo were constructed
long and narrow so they would connect
with both veranda and patio thus allowing
a free passage of air the beds were of
fresh linen stretched over wood frames
and the mosquito net which hung from
the ceiling was filmy and newly starched
	jungle

  ah sighed tommy trying out his bed
what did you and that dancing girl
talk about asked oneil

  dont snoop into my love life and dont
call seeva a dancing girl 

  answer my question before i wring
your scrawny neck

  what did we talk about  oh the stars
the perfume of the askata flowers down in
the garden

  what did she ask you about bendele
oneil could tell by tommys change
of expression that she had asked something
-and that he had told her something

  lay off oneil seevas a sweet kid
besides-and dont laugh-i feel sorry for
her that parrot-beaked shemeshal has
the pants scared off from her

  did you mention the black mahogany
for gods sake marinez is bound to
find out as soon as we start lumbering any-
how i cant see what difference it makes
plenty so long as he doesnt know
what were after hell play along with us
when he knows hell try to tie us up like
he has every other concession along the
ncimbo

  oh hum yawned tommy lighting a
smoke

  a sound from the direction of mr went-
worths room made them listen a few
seconds later the little man rushed in he
gulped a few times trying to speak

  oneil said i can see it in your face
youve been frisked

  the black mahogany box-its gone
oneil seemed to have expected this
his expression didnt even change he
just got up and led the way back to mr
wentworths room he looked around
without seeing anything of interest

  you and tommy wait here till i get
back he said im going to have a look
around

oneil was fairly certain someone was
watching him so to furnish an excuse
for his prowling he went to the patio and
got the half bottle of brandy which had been
left on the table he climbed back with it
but instead of going to his room he turned
a comer of the veranda hooked one of the
supports and swung quietly up to lie on
the thatched roof

  he had been there only a minute or two
when marinez walked by humming a

stories

  popular tune he went to his room it
was quiet then with no sound except the
night sounds of the jungle-the chatter of
night birds the whir of insects the un-
earthly cry of a carrion-hunting hyena

  oneil lay on his side looking at the
extremely brilliant universe of stars he
remembered what marinez had said early
that evening

     the jungle senhors it is ugly
and hot-but it can be beautiful too the
single shaft of sunlight falling through the
roof of the great forest like a ray through
a broken chink in a cathedral window the
quiet tread of a stalking leopard the surge
of a great river the flame throat of an
orchid which eats of death the glittering
stars 

  peculiar fellow marinez damned pe-
culiar   

  he heard someone moving softly around
the veranda it was not a sound so much
as an almost imperceptible vibration a sway
of the lightly built veranda there was
quiet for a while and then oneil noticed
it again soon there was a little sound
on the stairs and a minute later he glimpsed
a white-clad form moving across the yard
it was a man but beyond that he could tell
nothing

  have any visitors oneil asked
when he returned to mr wentworths
room

  no tommy answered

  somebody had a visitor

  they went around the veranda and
glanced in oneils room jit was just as
he had left it they looked in tommys
room and there sticking its hilt in the
pillow was an ebony-handled dagger

  tommy said oneil a smile twisting
his buddha face you have been warned
oneil went to bed and snored tommy
rolled with nightmare and awoke cursing
marinezs liquor while poor mr went-
worth stared all night at the blackness of
his ceiling

  when mr wentworth arose something
made him look once more through his
valise there in its old place beneath his
linen trousers was the little mahogany
box he couldnt imagine when it had been
put back and the more he wondered about
it the more frustrated he became he
showed up for breakfast hollow-eyed and
without appetite
black mahogany



iv

m he transcontinental termite as
a the english have dubbed the nar-
row-gauge rail line which connects with
chapleauville consists of a main line
sixty kilometers in length and a collection
of spurs the longest of these spurs is the
one running to bondele it is fifteen kilo-
meters long and was put through jungle
and over swamp at no small expense

  although several years had passed since
the spur had been traveled oneil found
it was still serviceable however bon-
deles teakettle locomotive gave him more
doubt after working on it for a week
putting in longer hours than a white man
should he scrubbed the grease from his
hands with a wad of waste and announced
to bobolongonga his helper that the pis-
tons should work provided the boiler stood
pressure

  bolongonga a magnificent black with
the most massive shoulders between chap-
leauville and the rapids of nkoi agreed with
this as with all statements made by oneil

  vari you speak much true monsieur
sin your wisdom it is wise bobo-
longonga was a traveled man having
worked as a grease-monkey in one of the
lake keva froth-flotation mills there he
had picked up many tongues of the white
man

  i am wise indeed said oneil and
i am strong too behold i could drive
this hook of mine through the very steel
of this boiler and indeed i will drive it
through the skull of that neer-do-well
tommy if he does not locate that black
mahogany and very soon

  ay ay chanted bobolongonga who
took all of oneils statements at face value
ay you are il bonde-moke you are un
grande nkoi

  i am more than a leopard bobo-
longonga i am also a k of p

  ay ay grinned bobolongonga rock-
ing to and fro with admiration

  oneil was lucky to have bobolongonga
he was experienced in the ways of a
wrench and furthermore he was willing
even during siesta time to work inside
the boiler of the locomotive which attained
heats no less than twelve degrees centigrade
lower than a vermont preachers hell-

  then when the long shadows came
bobolongonga shed his white pants which
were taboo in the presence of the fetish
and disappeared into the bush with dark-
ness the drums would start tom-toms with
the high pitch of tight-drawn monkey skin
down to the bass rumble of elephant hide
to these bobolongonga danced all night

  one day oneil asked him when he slept
and bobolongonga rolled his eyes and an-
swered cryptically

  ikete has much power

  the locomotive responded in a satisfac-
tory manner and as a treat oneil took
bobolongonga to chapleauville and back
but the combined skill of the two was un-
availing in the case of the caterpillar

  they tore it down oneil analyzed its
trouble then after satisfying himself that
tommy was not likely to turn up with any
of the black mahogany he made another
run to chapleauville he laid around the
discouraged little town until he was lucky
enough to pick up a tiny missionary steamer
bound for leopoldville

  at leopoldville he found repairs for the
caterpillar then as he had a few days be-
fore the scheduled return of the missionary
boat he took the railroad around the
cataracts to matadi from matadi he
cabled the veneering firm of anderson and
berg in stockholm and received an answer
the same day assuring him they were in-
terested in cedrelas heartwood of gaboon
quality especially in the novelty grains
which were not coming regularly from
dakar these days the price dealing di-
rect was half again better than selling to
commission merchants at matadi and
oneil after computing costs decided that
bondele might actually operate at a profit

  in the morning he received a second
cablegram from anderson and berg offier-
ing a premium of gaboqn which showed
floral pattern ribbon grain or fiddleback
when quartersawed provided logs were
cut in lengths not less than four meters and
provided further than the logs were deliv-
ered in stockholm not later than march
first if oneil as president of bondele
associates ltd would sign an agreement
of delivery at matadis banque par actions
he would in the course of the next twenty-
four hours receive a cable draft for 
guilders as evidence of anderson and bergs
good faith
	jungle

  oneil who disliked agreements de-
cided that  guilders would come in so
handy that he went straight to the banque
par actions and signed

  when he finally got back to leopoldville
the mission boat had left without him he
was another five days getting a steamboat
to coquilhatville and there he was reduced
to the extremity of hiring dugout canoes to
transport himself and his repair parts to
chapleauville thus three weeks were con-
sumed before he ran the locomotive back
to bondele

he expected some changes when he ar-
rived but if anything the place was
more- overgrown and discouraged than ever
neither tommy nor mr wentworth were
around but the big senegalese motala
was seated in a chair on the sagging
veranda smoking one of oneils cigars

  motala did not look up when oneil
approached he puffed phlegmatically and
stared off across the clearing perhaps his
eyelids drooped a trifle more balefully than
usual but that was all

  wheres tommy oneil demanded
motala did not move so oneil repeated
wheres tommy

  nis-enni he grunted

  when i ask in english you answer in
english

  you want heem you fin heem
oneil reached out with his toe and
flipped the chair from under motala who
struck with a heavy thud

  had any other person in all the congo
done this thing motala would have twisted
the life from him with his bare hands but
this was the man with the hook arm so
motala spat out his crumpled cigar and
said

  the white men they have gone to cilo
oneil thrust his hook beneath motalas
nose next time i see you on bondele
ill cleave thy skull with this remember
that you baskava you thrice son of a
pig you essence of camels dung

  surely with head low between his mas-
sive shoulders motala moved across the
plantation yard and disappeared into the
bush

  tommy and mr wentworth were half
an hour deep in siesta wrhen oneil reached
cilo he allowed mr wentworth to sleep
for the little man looked as though he

stories

needed it but he kicked the cot from under
tommy in about the same manner as he
had treated motala a short time before

  when tommy objected oneil cursed
him when tommy replied in kind oneil
threatened him with his hook

  you tropical tramp railed oneil
get me waltzed into a treadmill and then
you lay down on the job its that hula
dancer isnt it you cant stay away from
her

  nowj oneil you know me i can
take my women or leave em alone its
just that ive decided theres not a damn
cent to be made in mahogany

  who told you that

  i found it out by myself

  and from marinez after hed poured
you full of cognac

  tommy rubbed his chin the way he had
a habit of doing when something was true
and he didnt want to admit it have
a sundowner oneil

  oneil needed one any daggers in the
pillow lately

  no nor in me either tommy slapped
the automatic in the hip pocket of his shorts
but ive been keeping little ethyl handy
oneil snorted

  twenty-five calibre id as soon point
my finger and go bang 

  tommy didnt want to leave cilo but
oneil was unflinching they awakened
mr wentworth and were about ready to
start when marinez came around the
veranda red-eyed from sleep

  you are starting the lumbering he
asked oneil

  yes

  marinez downed a jolt of brandy and
said do not forget i am a partner too
in bondele i may speak yes it is thus
-bondele would bankrupt the millionaire
i will sink no moneys into it if you op-
erate it will be without my help

  marinez no longer smiled his words
were abrupt he seemed evil tempered as
men often are when arising too early from
siesta he spat across the veranda rail
and poured more brandy

  oneil said then you wont expect a
cut of the profits

  ha you speak like the fool there
will be no profit he took down half the
second glass and smiled a little but per-
haps there is something i do not know
black mahogany

about bondele perhaps you have the spe-
cial kind of mahogany no

  like that box you lifted from mr
wentworths valise

  marinez made no denial he merely
kept his thick lips twisted in a smile

  no marinez im drawing to a low
pair

  ho you speak in poker the ameri-
canos parable but if you should make
the pair a full house then of course
marinez will be there for his share then
in the old ingratiating tone tell me my
friend where do you find the black ma-
hogany 

  sure ill tell you that just as soon as
you tell me how you can live like a rajah
trading a ton of palm nuts and six bags of
jackass copal a year

three days later the first great ma-
hogany tree tore its way to earth on
the cutting grounds it was trimmed
sawed in segments and transported to the
jungle road by gangs of natives using ropes
and a rolling hitch the caterpillar pull-
ing in fine style after rejuvenation in the
form of new block pistons camshart and
numerous smaller parts hauled these seg-
ments and the ones which followed down
the zig-zag trail over a narrow dike built
between two miasma-infested sloughs and
deposited them beside the track at bondele

  oneil continually prodded for speed for
it would be impossible to move logs after
the strong rains of december

  one afternoon he came down from the
cutting grounds in time to see a woman
step ashore from a dugout canoe which a
couple of natives had nosed to the landing
the woman was seeva he took a short-
cut and intercepted her

  where to seeva

  to the house perhaps eet is the
friendly visit

  we dont encourage friendly visits
she rubbed one bare shoulder seductively
against his arm and looked up at him with
great soft eyes unlike most african
women seeva bathed with soap and
her hair was redolent of distilled-petal per-
fume of the sort made by armenians in
telfu because he was tempted oneil
became more brash

  i know why youre here so get back
to cilo



 why am i here

  because marinez sent you

 why should he send me

  for the same reason he sicked you onto
tommy in the first place

  phouj

  so get back in your boat and beat it
she elevated her nose and strode calmly
up the path to the house when oneil
went up half an hour later she was sitting
on the arm of tommys chair combing his
locks with her fingers and seeing to it his
glass was full

  oneil said send her home tommy
but tommy only smiled and shook his
handsome head ah oneil you
should not forget the words of the prophet
a guest in the tent is an obligation near
sacred and im the type of man who
never shirks his obligations

  trouble follows the woman says a
proverb antedating the words of the
prophet by perhaps two thousand years
trouble followed the woman to bondele
it sat waiting inside tommys bedroom
the night following seevas arrival

 when tommy stepped inside the dark
room and commenced feeling around for a
pack of cigarettes he realized someone else
was there no seventh sense passed down
from some prehistoric ancestor-it was
definite and olfactory a mixture of rank
perfume and sweat one finds emanating
from the men of asia minor

  tommy felt around the table as though
intending to light the petrol lamp he
knew it was too late to withdraw so he
continued to move slowly showing no hint
of alarm a sudden move he knew would
call for a strike from the upraised hand
of man just as from the poisoned head of
a cobra tommy quietly whistled a popu-
lar tune he had picked tip from the grama-
phone at cilo

  a rustle of clothing warned him of the
attack he thrust the table toward the
sound and moved swiftly aside the table
bumped something the lamp skidded and
crashed to pieces on the floor

  tommy found himself against the wall
untangling the tiny  calibre automatic
from the hip pocket of his shorts he stood
still gun in hand waiting for a sound or
for a shadow the heat of day was still
heavy and the odor of petrol made it al-
most unbearable
	jungle

  he listened-not for footsteps because
the jungle damp had rendered the floor
muggy so that walking across it was like
walking on cork-but for more subtle hints
of movement the rustle of clothing the
stir of air

  when the time came he didnt know
what it was that warned him-he just knew
the man was coming for him and the auto-
matic jumped to life spitting streaks of
orange-colored flame

  his assailant had not expected the gun
he retreated diving shoulder first through
the net-covered window tommy ran to
the veranda but by that time the man had
leaped to the ground and a few seconds
later he was a white-clad form dimly visible
among the cape jasmine bushes which
edged the cassava patch it might have
been a daylight shot of oneils luger
but still tommy aimed his ridicuolus little
gun and pulled the trigger the pin fell
with a dry click

  oneil was at the cutting grounds so
he did not hear of the encounter until he
navigated the cat down the following day
it was then he quoted the egyptian adage
about trouble following the woman   

v

the art of ikete witch doctor of the
bondele native village was as old
as the fears of man iketes charms for
battling the black devil of rat fever the
red devil of smallpox and the pale blue
devil of sleeping sickness were good for
they had been proved good long before
cleopatra discovered the luxury of rome
but though ikete knew well the value of
his ancient charms dances and incanta-
tions it would be incorrect to say that
more modern discoveries had passed him
by certain items stored in his little igloo-
shaped fetish hut would prove they had not

  for instance inside a monkeys skull
miraculous for its power in the healing
of yaws was aspirin which ikete had found
to be powerful charm against the devil of
headache which came from long hours of
chanting in the overheated huts of the
dead and he also kept carbolic acid the
burning water which drove out toothache
and laudanum which was good for just
about everything

and ikete knew of another charm of

stories

the white man a charm as powerful it
made these things seem as nothing for
with it could be secured women and rich
food shut up inside cans and liquor ten
times as strong as millet wine further-
more if a man had enough of it ikete
had been told he would even have power
over life and death

  ikete kept his store of this charm which
came in the form of round silver and little
scraps of paper inside the sacred rams
horn beneath the untouchable robe of bats
fur at the most secret corner of the fetish
hut

  he worshipped it even more than he
did sabata the fetish of his choice and
he plotted continually for its increase

  his greatest windfall came when marinez
of cilo built the road the year before at
that time ikete had made the fetish speak
out against the high wage of eight francs
per day with the result it was cut to four
with marinez and himself splitting the
difference so when bondele hired men
at the old rate of eight francs it was only
logical that ikete should visit the new
master-an ugly man with one arm only
the other sprouting an iron hook

  ikete crouched on the ground speak-
ing in the singsong chant of his craft

  eight francs much-much he chanted
sadly weaving from side to side much-
much bad for black man i have heard it
in dark moon bad for black man i have
seen it in fire flame bad for black man
iketes bones were almost fleshless his
arms dangled from his shoulderblades like
dried corpses on a gibbet his collarbone
protruded leaving deep hollows and the
only thing about him that seemed alive
were his eyes which rolled as he chanted

  whats the deal ikete oneil asked

  much money bad ke ke much bad
eight francs you make four francs so
say sabata sabata will speak by moon-
light

  and where do you come in

  ke ke i have nothing sabata have
all you pay sabata two francs you keep
two francs sabata will keep men at work
you pay ikete one hundred francs now
ikete go to sabata-

  you go to hell

  ikete kept chanting so oneil shouted it
-go to hell

  the witch doctors manner suddenly
black mahogany



changed he leaped up crouching and
spat at oneils feet

  a curse to you in the name of
sabata    and he backed away into
the creepers of the jungle casting maledic-
tions in the unknown fetish tongue

  ikete left longing for revenge but he
longed for the charm of money still more
he plotted to obtain both knowing that
marinez was anxious to close bondele and
all other plantations along the ncimbo
river ikete appeared at cilo that same day
and suggested that for a consideration
sabata might call the long dances to lay
the devils of disease thus tying up oneils
labor force until the rainy season came

  at dawn he returned to his fetish hut
gloatingly stuffed paper and silver inside
the secred rams horn beneath the untouch-
able robe of bats fur and through the day
he crouched in the close mud hut beating
the bladder-drum of incantation and chant-
ing words in the fetish language

  few men worked in mahogany that day
few women cut cassava in the field they
gathered in awed groups outside the hut
and listened

  next day commenced the long dances to
lay the devils of disease

  oneil found donomey the old fat chief
of the village resting after five hours in
the dance and offered to raise wages
donomey was friendly but he refused he
feared ikete and the fetish perhaps he
said it would be possible to please the
fetish with money but oneil was stub-
born he willed donomey ikete and all
of them to the fires which never end and
journeyed across the river to the village of
chief ngando who came with all his warri-
ors when promised the usual wages plus a
bonus in the form of the ornaments which
could be beaten from the brass of all the old
steam fittings in the repair shop

  they worked while donomeys people
danced for three days it was thus on
the morning of the fourth day oneil came
along in the caterpillar to find that a fetish
house of sticks and fresh mud had been
built in the narrowest place along the dike
which separated the two swamps the
black devil of fever ikete had told them
arose from the green waters of those
swamps and it was here the dances must
pj-ogress

  move your damned camp to one side

shouted oneil striding unannointed into
the dancing circle

  ikete crouched among the tom-toms eyes
rolling back into his skull anno-keke
he chanted

  oneil appealed to donomey but the
old fat chief would not move against the
fetish even bobolongonga who had
traded his adjustable wrench for the lance
of his ancestors and his white mans pants
for a skirt of pink-dyed raffia could not
be lured from the circle

  oneil soon had enough of arguing he
remounted the lofty seat of the caterpillar
let out the clutch and advanced under full
throttle with a mighty roar of exhaust
the monster rolled across the ceremonial
fire sending dancers fleeing into the
swamps it demolished tom-toms and gri-
gris and drove on directly for the holy of
holies the mud hut of sabata

  the natives watched confidently expect-
ing oneil and caterpillar both to dissolve
in blue flame but no such thing took place
the cat mounted the sloping wall of the
hut for a meter or so and then the home
of sabata collapsed in a heap of mud sticks
and straw

  thus lay shattered not only the mud
hut but also much of the power of ikete
donomey who long had resented thewitch
doctors power ordered his men back to
the cutting grounds

but ikete was not yet licked he re-
treated to his old hut in the village
chanted to the fetish throughout an after-
noon and a night and appeared with the
untouchable robe of bats fur around his
shoulders and an ancient calibash turned
over his head thus equipped he com-
menced praying oneil to death

  nijji-fe-bowa chanted ikete the
curse of sabata upon him

  work stopped again even subjects of
chief nganda spent their days near the
fetish hut awaiting the result

  it was soon noticed that oneil had
dropped from sight a houseboy from
bondele brought word that he had sickened
and lay all day in his hammock ikete
chanted with new enthusiasm and
donomey repenting his haste issued a
useless order against working at the cut-
ting grounds rumors were many oneils
brown skin had turned green his flesh
	jungle

had run away leaving him only skin
stretched over skeleton and his hook arm
had sprouted a branch of poison ninga
leaves berries and all

  actually oneil had chosen this poorest
of all times to go down for his yearly bout
with the fever after five days he got up
and ministered to himself with whiskey
it was then tommy told him about iketes
machinations

  oneil did not know it at the time but
even his arising had strengthened the belief
in ikete

  it is thus-according to the sabata fet-
ish the man being prayed to death will at
first sleep and waste away then when
the proper moment arrives the anointed
of sabata takes the calibash from his head
and has brought to him a cockerel utter-
ing certain words he breaks one and then
the other of the cockerels legs after which
he holds the poor bird overhead for a
long time it is thus with the witch doctor
staring at the cockerels bill and speaking
in the fetish language at last a drop of
blood appears at the cockerels bill and
falls striking the witch doctors tongue
when that drop of blood falls the victim
must arise be he fifty kilometers away and
hasten to the fetish hut where he must
dance until he expires

  and so the links of circumstances which
began with oneils recurrence of the fever
now continued as he strode along the
jungle trail toward the village as he
went message drums gave out their rock-
ing speechlike rhythm

a cry went up from four hundred na-
tive throats when he appeared in the
village clearing a lane opened for him as
he strode up to the ceremonial fire where
ikete untrembling and triumphant was
holding aloft the dripping bird

  ikete signaled with his lips and the tom-
toms throbbed the slow rhythm of the dance
of death but it was there the links of cir-
cumstance failed oneil did not dance

  he strode on booting tom-toms from his
way seized the cockerel from iketes hands
and commenced beating him over the head
with it

  after a squawk or two the poor bird ex-
pired oneil beat ikete with the carcass
until feathers flew ikete took it for a
while then he fled across the clearing and

stories

along a jungle path with oneil in pursuit

  next day donomey ordered a full crew
to the cutting grounds and a young witch
doctor was at the village gathering sticks
to build a hut to willilahau the river fetish
who he asserted hastened the fermenta-
tion of millet and the fruitfulness of the
harvest and was morever very powerful
having a hook arm

  ikete although defeated still had re-
venge his machinations had caused such
delay it was apparent they could get out
no sufficient quantity of correctly grained
wood before the roads bogged down

  then one morning donomey came to
camp followed by two of his tribesmen who
carried a huge crotch of mahogany it
was waterlogged from the swamp and the
sapwood was rotting away but the center
of twisted grain was hard and streaked
deep brown and black

  considerable of the black mahogany all
in deadfalls had been revealed by the re-
ceding waters of the dry season oneil
said the sulphuric and copperas waters of
the swamp had turned it that color and
it was a moral victory for the opinion he
had expressed back in coquilhatville still
the wood was worth good money and it
did not take him long to get crews on the
ground to pull the logs and peel the rotting
sapwood through the following weeks
as rains commenced and grew worse
threatening to mire the catetrpillar oneil
rushed the transport to bondele   

  oneil was so tired one night that he
decided he would sleep in a hammock at
the camp he stretched out and had just
closed his eyes when the sound of excited
voices aroused him a boy had broken
up the nightly dance and was repeatedly
shouting the name donomey

  oneil tried to learn what was wrong
but nobody seemed sure he joined the
torchlit group which followed the boy along
the little-used jungle path after four
or five kilometers travel the uplifted torches
revealed donomey lying beside a nest of
bulldog ants oneil pushed through the
circle and felt for the old mans pulse
donomey was dead

  it was not death but the manner of it
which shocked oneil the native boy
had cut him down but it was evident that
the fat chieftan had been strung up by the
thumbs smeared with honey and allowed
black mahogany



to dangle so his toes would just touch the
four-foot high anthill

  so this was the penalty for donomeys
cooperation a feeling of white anger
burned through oneil

  an ancient native with gray wool hair
danced on spindly legs and chanted others
followed in broken rhythm no ritual-
they danced as an outlet for emotion

  oneil watched them carry donomeys
body to his hut which was soon filled with
black men one packed against anothei
perspiring chanting the words of death
he could hear the rocking wail of their
voices for a long time as he walked the
path toward bondele

he arrived at the house so quietly that
two who were sitting on the veranda
jumped when he spoke as he expected
one was seeva the other to his surprise
was mi wentworth

  when did you come down from cilo
oneil asked seeva

  maybe-so after siesta

  who wras there when you left
nobody jus houseboy so i get
lonesome and come she came close to
oneil as she always did when she was
after a favor now that seeva tell you
true you wont tell tommy how long im
here no

  i wont tell him a damned thing
ahem said mr wentworth self con-
sciously

  when did you see marinez and
shemeshal last oneil asked seeva

  maybe las night she came closer
than ever rubbing herself against him with
purring feline seductiveness i dont want
go back to cilo i want stay here all time
i am afraid at cilo i am good girl mshu
you let me stay i can help

  doing what

  i dance mix drink do you not like
woman mshu was it not your prophet
who say man does not live by bread
alone 

  where did you ever learn that

  at convent school of good sisters of
charity in motake

  i can imagine you damned near any
place except in a convent

  besides if i stay perhaps i can tell
you things she wheedled marinez
i can say he want all planation along river

hes one who hire ikete hes one who
have poison arrow shoot at mr wentworth
to scare him away hes one offer money
to donomey for quit work but donomey
answer no then marinez say maybe he
shoot donomey

  when did you find all that out
  shemeshal i hear him tell motala
  you can stay said oneil   

  the penetrating high-frequency squeal
of steam through a weighted safety valve
brought oneil from his hammock at the
hour of sunup two days later

  he looked down from his window and
cursed bobolongonga instead of build-
ing up a moderate pressure which would
suit the age of the locomotive boiler had
stuffed the firebox with pitchwood and
moved the valve weight out to the last
notch

  oneil did not take time to cover his
toenails with the customary adhesive in
protection against the wet seasons chiggers
he simply vaulted the railing as he was
and ran down the path to open the safety
valve he was about to make his usual
threat of splitting bobolongongas skull
with his hook arm when the sound of an
exhaust drew his attention to the river
in a few seconds marinezs launch came in
sight swinging in an arc to break its speed

  with an effort marinez heaved his con-
siderable bulk to the dock the other man
in the boat was motala he made no
move to come ashore but sat surly faced
looking at oneil

  ah-i see you would haul log my
friend cried marinez

  as you see answered oneil

  but the railroad-perhaps you do not
understand it crosses the lamotte ground
below here and lamotte she belongs to
me

  and what of that

  i cannot allow it senhor

but we have a legal right to cross
marinez was extremely sad believe
me i am so sorry but business she is
as you say business i forbid the legal
right our colonial administration must de-
cide if they say you pass very well
oneil knew that coquilhatville would
refer the matter to leopoldville and leo-
poldville would pass it on to brussels an
answer in two years would be fortunate
no hard feelings asked marinez
	jungle

  i dont suppose you had any hard feel-
ings toward donomey either shouted
tommy who had arrived in time to hear
the last of marinezs words i suppose
that was business too

  donomey  marinez controlled his
anger and put on an expression of sorrow
you think i strung poor donomey by the
thumbs no this is not true i perhaps
try to hire him perhaps even threaten-
but the torture it is not me i will kill
where necessary but quick with the bullet
through the brain this killing of donomey
was for two things-to make natives fear
bondele and to make all men suspect me
marinez walked over to examine the
mahogany loaded on the flatcars is
beautiful wood such color-like the
skin of africa this load she is worth for-
tune no

  no answered oneil

vi

marinez departed siesta passed
the sun disappeared into the bluish
forest haze at its monotonous six oclock
on the veranda armless oneil tommy
huston and little mr wentworth sat sip-
ping whiskey and soda as though they were
without plans for that night-or for
eternity

  twilight thickened into the peculiar
bluish quality of tropic night they sat
on their positions revealed by the pin-point
lights of their cigarettes and by the occa-
sional quiet laughter of seeva who was
with them

  when darkness was an hour deep oneil
sat up and kicked back his chair bobo-
longonga he called in a voice that was
not too loud

  bobolongonga had been squatting by the
locomotive he made no answer there
was no need of it for he knew what was
expected of him he opened the firebox
heaped in pitchwood and defied fate and
the instructions of oneil by dousing the
wood and the still-hot grate with petrol
it was midnight before steam was up and
everything was in readiness

  oneil told mr wentworth to stay and
take care of bondele whatever that con-
sited of he posted tommy on the rear car
with a rifle gave the throttle to bobo-
longonga and mounted to the cowcatcher

stories

  the heavily laden train moved slowly
unlighted through the deep jungle shadow
it was six kilometers to the frontier of
bondele which was marked by a finger of
swamp extending up from the river they
stopped at the edge of a long wooden
bridge while oneil lit the carbide head-
light it showed the rails stretching in
reddish streaks uninterrupted across the
bridge and into the distant jungle oneil
grunted in a satisfied manner and lighted a
cigarette if marinez had intended to de-
stroy the line this would have been the
most likely spot

  he let the light remain on and voiced no
objection when bobolongonga gave the
engine another inch or two of throttle

  congo days are long with fly-droning
heat that seems destined to last without
interruption for the remainder of time but
nights are cool with jewel-like clarity after
crossing the bridge oneil relaxed a little
and commenced enjoying that night it
was pleasant feeling the air move past
there on the cowcatcher and he had just
reached the yawning stage when something
brought him up abruptly

  a white object had appeared for a mo-
ment perhaps two hundred meters down
the track then it dropped suddenly from
view oneil crouched a trifle through in-
stinct just as something whanged the steel
a foot or two over his head following
like an echo was the report of a high-pow-
ered rifle

  probably the bullet had been aimed high
intentionally but there was no point in
taking a chance oneil still had dreams
of his little poolhall in chicago so with
a swing of his hook he severed the copper
tubing which supplied gas to the headlamp

  gun it he shouted to bobolongonga

  there was no i-esponse the engine
still crept along at its miserable rate half
a dozen rifles now opened up and these
werent deliberately missing bullets
clanged against the boiler steel and whined
off into the dark one of them loosened a
rivet letting steam out with a high-pitched
whistle

  oneil swung around the side and clam-
bered into the cab he found bobo-
longonga moaning with fear crouched be-
hind the iron face of the firebox oneil
trod over him and gave the engine full
throttle
black mahogany	

  the drivers answered with a series of
violent revolutions but there was little trac-
tion and they were slow in gaining speed
still however slow they were moving
every second was bringing them closer
oneil was not the suicide type he de-
cided on retreat

  he booted bobolongonga until the terri-
fied black raised to hands and knees then
he hooked him by the collar and dragged
him begging and moaning as far as the
first flatcar

  bobolongonga finding himself in the
open recovered use of his legs he fled
along the logs until he reached the end
car where tommy waited tommy defy-
ing death with a lighted cigarette was
happily waiting the proper moment to pay
back bullets in kind

  oneil emptied his luger in the general
direction of the gun flashes a piece of blind
shooting intended to discourage a charge on
the engine then he too ran to the rear

  get down you damned fool he growled
at tommy and put out that cigarette

  tommy ignored him oneil youre
getting jumpy as a titmouse

  oneil cursed him and cut the cigarette
in half with a swing of his hook arm they
were picking up speed rapidly now gun-
fire and shouting voices were close but all
the bullets seemed to be aimed at the
engine they rode safely through the
thick of it

  marinezs voice boomed out in com-
mand and all except one of the guns went
silent this cracked three more times then
no sound except the rattle of the train

  what the hell oneil asked and he
got his answer

  there was a mighty vibrating roar the
roadbed rolled beneath them and the air
became thick with dirt and flying fragments
of wood when it was over the train was
still on the track and still moving-but
moving towtard a ragged hole which had
been torn in the roadbed a hundred meters
further along

  jump oneil commanded and neither
tommy nor bobolongonga hesitated

  oneil did not follow them he ran
forward along the flatcars made the cab at
the end of a mighty leap cut the throttle
and gave the engine all the brakes she had

  there was a howl of metal and the en-

-jungle stories-spring

gine slowed in a series of convulsive jerks
it seemed to halt at the very edge of the
hole left by the explosion but the mo-
mentum of the loaded flatcars inched it
unwillingly forward it nosed down sank
into the soft rubble of the depression and
settled gently over at a forty-five degree
angle the strain caused the throttle to
release a little the drivers responded with
a few spasmodic revolutions and she died
there heaving like a stricken warhorse

  oneil had not ridden her down he
had jumped a few meters back but he came
forward now to examine the situation and
declare it hopeless

  and just when i was getting attached
to the damned little teakettle he moaned
when tommy and bobolongonga came up

ftw wrhat tommy asked

  x  why back to bondele to see
how things fare with mr wentworth
then to cilo where i intend to put my
hook through that portugees skull

  it was a long walk to bondele they
took siesta near the bridge and it was eve-
ning when they trudged across the yard
to the plantation house

  wentworth shouted oneil when he
saw no one around

  seeva called tommy

  she didnt answer either oneil ran
up the steps and around the veranda he
came back to find tommy reading a note
which had been left on the table there
was a tight expression on tommys face
that made oneil wonder when he read
the note he understood

my dear friends

  having received an excellent offer from sr
marines for my interest in bondele i have decided
to sell please do not think too harshly of me
it is just that i have become very homesick for
england

yours sincerely

                   harvey wentworth
ps-miss seeva who will soon be mrs went-
zvorth has gone with me

h w

  oh allah muttered oneil what a
swath that gal will cut through chatham
tommy dropped weakly into a chair and
called bobolongonga  bring whiskey
oneil cursed wentworth in a dutiful
sort of way but without real ire he didnt
blame anybody for grabbing a chance to get
out of a country which he admitted to be
	jungle

the sump-hole of creation tommy poured
whiskey and almost wept

  i loved her oneil i dont know when
i ever loved a woman so much unless
maybe it was that dutch gal over in mafiti
youre damned well rid of her oneil
barked caring nothing whatever for the
delicacy of tommys feelings

  tommy moaned i could see she felt
motherly toward him i should have sus-
pected something then

  you fiddle-playing fathead

  oneil hunted out a cold lunch of bully
beef and cassava bread after which he an-
nounced he was ready to start to cilo

  come on tommy maybe a stray bul-
let wall put you out of your misery

  they reached the house at cilo about
midnight but nobody ws around except
the houseboy the houseboy protested
that marinez had left after siesta but oneil
satisfied himself by searching the place
he dragged tommy away from marinezs
brandy and went to the plantation village
where the nightly dance was in progress
stimulated by a couple of francs an old
crone recalled seeing marinez shemeshal
and motala walking along the road which
led from the dock to the old warehouses
that had been about dark

  let them go to the devil said tommy
id rather go up to the house and revenge
myself on his fancy liquor

  oneil ignored the suggestion and led
the way along a dark little-used roadway
it took them half an hour to find the ware-
houses now abandoned and almost lost be-
neath the undergrowth

  i told you it was a damned fool trip
said tommy when they failed to find a light
or a sign of anyone

  oneil didnt answer he was listening
a sound resembling some strange animal
came from the direction of a shed almost
buried beneath ochilla weed it was a
monotonous sound like panting breath a
throat rattle and a groan all in one

  they moved cautiously around the weed
patch and took a path into the overhanging
jungle it was dense for a while then the
foliage opened up and they were at the edge
of a little clearing the moonlight filter-
ing through a huge bokangu tree revealed
that something hung from one of its lower
branches

  it was marinez bound smeared with

stories

honey and hanging by his thumbs so his
toes just touched a hill of bulldog ants

  oneil cut him down and beat the insects
away

  light a fire he told tommy well
see how bad they got him

  marinez sat up and moaned ah you
they have killed me no

  no answered oneil youll live
with the help of some ointment though i
cant see why i should give a damn

  ah my thumbs my poor legs never
did the martyrs suffer as i suffered but
you have save me and i live perhaps it
is the justice of poetry no me marinez
try to ruin you and you put me in life-
long debt

  is that poetry who strung you up
here anyway

  who but shemeshal and his pig of a
helper motala and why  i will tell you
despite my misery because i sell my
own property-that dancing girl the
same seeva he was so jealous for that he
would kill all who look at her ah it is
an unjust woild

  so you traded seeva for wentworths
interest in bondele

  and paid five thousand francs to boot
quiet down marinez if tommy finds
out about it hell want to give you back
to the ants

tommy had his fire going in a heap of
dry thatch it blazed high lighting
the clearing he was standing there watch-
ing the flame when the report of a gun
rang out tommy spun and fell from the
impact of the bullet he was down but
not unconscious he had presence of mind
to crawl to the shadow of a clump of weeds

  oneil drew his pistol and leaped to
the protection of the tree but motala ap-
peared behind him a high-powered rifle
leveled

  you weel not trick me thees time hook-
arm he gloated no thees time it is
i motala who laugh last

  shoot you fool commanded sheme-
shal appearing among a rubble of ruined
native huts

  motala would have obeyed but the spite-
ful crack of tommys little automatic made
him spin around the bullet had missed
but the diversion was all oneil needed
he dove head forward for motala
black mahogany	

  motala tried to aim but oneil was be-
neath the rifle barrel he swung the barrel
at oneils skull and that didnt work
either oneil took a glancing blow on
the shoulder doubled the senegalese with
a right to the solar plexis and came over
with the hook motala went down

  when motala dropped his rifle marinez
pounced on it shemeshal saw him and
fired but the bullet was a meter or two
wide of the mark missing the shot caused
him to lose his nerve he shot again more
wildly than before and fled for the pro-
tection of the jungle

marinez came slowly to a sitting pos-
ture he was a long time getting the
rifle to his shoulder it seemed that sheme-
shal would surely escape but at the last mo-
ment just as he was disappearing into the
dark jungle the gun leaped in marinezs
hands and shemeshal tossed his arms and
collapsed like a cloth dummy

  marinez made it to his feet and walked
to where shemeshal had fallen tommy
somewhat recovered from the shock of a
flesh wound in the hip hobbled over too

  see smiled marinez did i not once
tell you i was the humane man did i
do as another might have done did i
shoot him through the bowels so he would
suffer through the heat of siesta no
i shoot him in the temple is good no
an hour later marinez lay in his ham-
mock treating himself with brandy and
almost weeping to think of how he had
mistreated tommy and oneil he was
so repentant that he offered  francs
for their interest in bondele and oneil
after reserving the right to fallen timber
accepted

  alas what do i care for money 
sighed marinez it is that i feel sad
and i wish my soul to be at peace it is
not long i have on this world senhors
the torture of the ants it has done some-
thing to me one year i have left-with
plenty of liquor perhaps three yes i am
weak with generosity i will agree let
us sign the papers where are you going
to europe-portugal perhaps in lis-
bon burn a candle for me 

  it was midway in the rains the muggy
heat of coquilhatville seemed to possess
measureable viscosity no white man

should be asked to endure it-but thank
god oneil was on his way out

  feisal you son of a pig shouted oneil
banging the table with his hook is there
no ice to serve with this vile brandy
mohammed bowed his way over to the
table where tommy and oneil were sit-
ting and clasped his hands in a histronic
expression of regret

  ah masters it is the ice machine-
dont give us that old stall about it
being in leopoldville

  having its bearings reground mo-
hammed stretched his arms toward mecca
o allah in thy day of judgment behold
that administrator who ships away our ice
machine and curses us with taxes

just bring us the water sighed oneil
mohammed pulled the cap from the bottle
of water with a flourish and asked have
you been at bondele o hook-armed one
at bondele

  then your pieces of gold must be as
the stars in the firmament

  why

  because of the grand lorry road com-
ing over from the oil fields and the pip-
line too not to speak of the new channel
being dredged by the government one hun-
dred kilometers above chapleauville it
is the work of the soap corporation mas-
ters the same corporation which has poured
gold into the lap of that infidel portuguese
pablo marinez but you are rich-
hold on cried tommy lorry road 
pipeline oneil did you hear that that
damned marinez beat us out after all burn
a candle for him in lisbon he says why

  allah-humma chanted mohammed in

red rogue killer

by day keene

all the jungle shrieked the red-bearded gods cruelty men died in his
terror-kraal-the living flesh stripped from their bodies and now this girl
lovely and young had come into his district of death begging to be taken
to him claiming he was her brother

the big american strode out of the
bush onto the station parade ground
at katumbo exactly at high noon
noiselessly at carters heels padded
nylabo the black

  behind carter lay twelve days of hell
his boots were straps of leather his
shirt and trousers had been torn to flying
tatters by the wilderness of desiccated
thorn scrub through which he had trekked
a battered once white sun helmet was
pushed far back on his forehead exposing
grizzled curls plastered to his head with
sweat his face was lined with strain and
burned black by the sun a stubble cov-
ered his jowls he wore a heavy colt
strapped to one thigh africa had made
a man out of the callow young doctor who
had disembarked at angola almost ten
years before

  the grateful back country natives called
him bwana juju unscrupulous white
traders arab slavers and wealthy big
game hunters had called him lots of things

  but for a few bare-footed native sol-
diers drowsing in the midday heat the
unkempt parade ground was deserted be-
yond the company managers squat white
tin-roofed office he could see the monthly
mail boat tied up at the wharf

  a sudden wave of nostalgia swept him
in ten days he could be in brazza-ville
in ten more he could be in angola in
another two weeks if he was lucky he
could be back in new york he could be
clean and cool and safe

  beside him worried nylabo asked we
have not come this long way for boon
bwana 

  no carter shook his head we
havent come this long way for nothing

  he licked at his heat-parched lips and
strode on ismail the snag-toothed arab
interpreter was squatted on his heels in


the shade outside of maastricts door he
stood up as carter neared him and intoned
in the name of god peace be with you
carter had never liked the man he
was too oily and with you he an-
swered shortly

  after the glare of the sun the office
was cool and dark maastrict stood up
to greet him this iss a pleasure doc-
tor i was about to send an escort after
you

  nylabo squatted on his heels just out-
side the door his tawny eyes appraising
the slim young memsahib whom his bwana
blinded by the sudden darkness had not
as yet seen

ismail moved as if to close the door
eyed the razor-sharp assegai cradled ia
nylabos arms and changed his mind if
bwana juju was a devil nylabo was his
shadow where the white man walked
the black man followed

  inside the office carter stared at the
belgian puzzled you were about to
send an escort after me then the last
runners i sent you got through you
know then

  a slow-moving stolid man maastrict sat
back in his chair and dry-washed his fat
palms together know what what are
you talking about what- he checked
himself stood up pardon me miss sut-
liff doctor carter may i present you
to miss sutliff

  carter brushed a sun blackened hand
across his eyes the girl wasnt real she
couldnt be she was a part and parcel of
the nightmare through which he had been
moving for the last three months

  the girls fingers were cool and soft in
his im real she assured him but
i am a long way from home

  he released her fingers and apologized
                                                                                  loi
	jungle

pardon me if i stared at you like a takala
one but ive been through enough in
the last ninety days to make me crazy
the company manager stared at him
sharply you are not yourself doctor
he fumbled in a drawer perhaps a
taste of schnapps   

  carter waved the bottle aside later
right now ive got to talk to you alone
ellen sutliff shook her head i wont
leave this office until you agree to take me
back in with you ive traveled eight thou-
sand miles to reach here and i wont
give up now i wont

  carter reached the bottle from the desk
and gulped a drink perhaps i am crazy
he admitted

  the girl continued you dont know
me but i know you by reputation and
shortly before you arrived mr maastrict
informed me that you are the only man
in the belgian congo perhaps in all of
africa who can help me

  carter stood fingering the butt of his
gun i havent the least idea what you
are talking about

  her brother was barney sutliff
maastrict told him

  oh carter said he had heard of
the soldier of fortune many times but he
had never met him the last he had heard
of the man his plane had reputedly crashed
on a flight from durban to cairo

  ive traced barneys route the girl
said quietly he was seen over lake
tanganyika but he never reached stan-
leyville that means that he must have
crashed somewhere in the valley of the
lost ones

  then hes dead carter told her
shortly

  i dont believe that she cried and
i want to outfit a safari to bring him out
you can name your own price to lead it
mr maastrict informs me that you are
the only white man whom the natives will
allow into the valley

  carter shook his head what you ask
is impossible that whole back country
has gone mad thats why im here
he slipped a leather hypodermic case from
his pocket and shook out two polished
darts on maastricts desk

  the girl reached for one and he slapped
her hand thats sudden death he
warned her they missed me by hairs

stories

he continued it would seem that some-
one whoever is behind this didnt want
me to come out he poked at the blow
gun darts with a pencil that one is a
poisoned kalclii thorn from the varnished
look of the other one i imagine that it was
steeped in stropanthin extracted from the
kombe bean

maastrict had gone white-faced
but i dont understand

  neither do i carter admitted curtly
it began four months ago with a furtive
raid on a ngoma twenty nditos-maid-
ens-were stolen from that dance by a
motley assortment of hideously painted
braves of no known tribe since then its
been hell on earth a dozen kraals have
been looted and burned to the ground the
men women and children slaughtered
other whole kraals have disappeared men
women children and livestock have just
vanished into the jungle

  vanished 

  as you erase chalk from a blackboard
the company manager got to his feet
but that is absurd people dont just
vanish you have been in the back coun-
try too long doctor you need a rest
the bush is getting on your nerves

  im not mad carter insisted
maastrict did not hear him ya you
had better go down river on the steamer
what you need are lights and music and
rest you have been working too hard
perhaps a month or so in brazza-ville or
angola   

  carter shook his head doggedly ill
be damned if i will im going back to
my district theres something hellish go-
ing on up there but i want a company
of soldiers i want rifles and machine
guns i   

  outside the door nylabo sprang to his
feet crying loudly masai na-kudha
bwana

  the masai are coming carter stepped
to the door and stared out into the blazing
sun

  it was difficult to recognize the two gro-
tesque figures staggering across the pa-
rade ground as men their heads were
matted with clotted blood great swarms
of kuuna flies covered their faces like veils
red welts circled their bodies the black
skin hung from their thighs and legs in
red rogue killer	

flaps as carter watched one of the men
collapsed the other man staggered on
alone it was one of the masai runners
whom he had sent for help two weeks be-
fore

  nylabo ran to aid the man who did
this he demanded

  sheitani the devil the masai gasped
he sank down in the shade of the building
his sunken eyes beginning to glaze he
talked swiftly against time

  he says nylabo told carter that
barely had they left the bwanas kraal than
he and mgoru were set upon by many
warriors they - were swahili masai
kavirondo kikuyu wakambas morani
bakussu and many more whom he did not
recognize all were led by a red-bearded
black god who bellowed like a bull that
all but the chosen of the gods must go to
the place of dying he says that they were
kept captive many days in a big cave in
the valley of the lost ones each day
they were tortured that the red-bearded
black god might laugh when life had
almost left them they were yolked as slaves
in a long line of captive men and women
they managed to break free

  carter squatted beside the runner
where   he began then stood up
the man was dead

  the now awakened natives wailed
hoi hoi hoi hoi ee-yah ee-yah
eeyah eeyah masra godoo kro-
manti kromanti

  cold sweat trickled down carters spine
as he realized that they were calling on
kromanti the tiger spirit the terrible
guinea coast god who lives in a silk cotton
tree

  nylabo fingered the edge of his assegai
spat gimshai has stolen his soul and not
even kromanti can bring it back

  maastrict dry-washed his fat hands
this is incredible he whimpered i
hardly know how to report it to the com-
pany directors i dont know what to
think i dont know what to say

  carter settled his gun belt on his hips
its not a matter of saying its a matter
of doing something this man was tor-
tured to death by some foul inhuman
fiend and im heading back up bush in
the morning

  ellen sutliff gripped his arm im go-
ing with you her next words chilled his

blood cant you understand ive got
to know barney has red hair

  carter looked at his own sun-blackened
hand a good many tribes were light as
far as color was concerned he himself
could easily pass as black well ill be
damned you dont believe    

  i dont know the girl sobbed but
if its barney hes out of his mind i
have to know i have to and im going
in with you in the morning

  life carter thought was filled with
problems but some of them were unfair
he studied the simple faces of the natives
now led by a white-robed jelanti as the
talkee godoo swelled in volume a white
man falling from the sky might possibly
establish himselef as a god in the minds of
the back bush natives still planes were
common they flew overhead every day
and the man in back of this was sane
there was a profit motive somewhere no
mad man could have linked together tribes-
men who hated each other to the death
there was a reason for the burned kraals
for the missing villagers there was some-
thing foul and deep and dark here that
only full exposure to the light would re-
veal

  well see he told the girl well
see

  his mind was made up whether the
red-bearded black god was sutliff whether
sutliff was mad or not the girl would
remain at the station the back country
surrounding the valley of the lost ones
was no place for a woman the lush green
valley was africa rawr and untamed
primeval

they had left the station behind them
in the dark of the hour before sun-up
later wrould come the wilderness of thorns
and the tall veldt- grass that cut like a knife
still later would come the river here
the jungle rose in a green-roofed cathedral
over the heads of the safari his hand on
the butt of his gun nylabo padding at his
heels carter led the file of burden-laden
bearers and the scant platoon of poorly-
armed soldiers that maastrict had begrudg-
ingly given him he had claimed that he
needed the others for the protection of the
station

  daybreak was a misty glow that filtered
through the green that colored the long
	jungle

gray beards of fungus hanging down from
the trees a bushbuck crossed the trail
a little farther on a forest hog eyed the
men suspiciously and merged again with
the green but for the drip of the night
dew the silence was complete

  this was the hour that carter liked best
of all

  the sun was high in the trees when
nylabo sniffed the air suspiciously it
held a stale mousey smell that told him
that a colony of monkeys had traveled the
trail before them perhaps even now were
perched gray blossoms of fur high in the
trees above them eyeing the intruders but
there was also another smell the unwashed
stench of men

  bwana i like this not he began

  carter had paused as he had spoke had
glanced back down the strung-out safari to
make certain that all was well black
anger darkened his face

  so youre furious so what ellen
sutliff stepped out from in back of the
massive black who had masked her she
was wearing riding breeks and boots she
carried a heavy  manlicher as if she
knew how to use it i dont care what
you said last night im going with you

i	can take care of myself

  with an elephant gun

  youre after big game

  and deadly game carter said coldly
all that you have done is delay us take
her back to the station nylabo and tell
maastrict that i said 

  he broke off sharply his hand whipping
his gun from its holster as the jungle came
to life with a sudden smacking of lips and
dry coughing alarmed the colony of
monkeys swdshed by over their heads but
there was nothing to shoot at nothing to
be seen

  malignantly alive the green wall of the
jungle hemmed them in then a massive
swahili bearer dropped his load and
clapped a palm to his chest when he
took it away again his eyes bulged from
his head in fear clutched between his
fingers was a deadly kalchi dart

  take cover carter bawled

  cursing he forced the girl behind the
shelter of a huge gray trunked baobab tree
other bearers were dropping now all
were calling on gedeonsu to save them

stories

far back down the trail the soldiers were
firing blindly into the green then one
of them broke and ran a poisoned dart
dropped him in his tracks

  another dart spitt into the tree at
carters ear it was followed by a sharp-
tipped poisoned arrow that thudded into
the leaf mould between himself and the
girl he caught a flash of movement in
the leaves and fired there was a crack-
ling and crashing of branches and a hide- 
ously painted bakussu fell almost at his
feet still clutching his deadly blow gun
with the last of his dying strength the
savage raised his blow gun and nylabo
nailed him to a root of the baobab with a
powerful thrust of his assegai

  the attack ended as suddenly as it had
begun half of the bearers and soldiers
were dead the others were milling help-
lessly carter came to a swift decision
he had no way of knowing how many men
were in the attacking party but through
the tunnel of the trees he could see the
open veldt there lay comparative safety
at least they could not be ambushed to
go back down the trail meant to die death
lay between them and the station

  cursing shouting encouraging he
herded the frightened bearers and soldiers
up the trail toward the open ground the
girl backed after them wide-eyed but her
gun held ready in her hands

  chanting defiance hurling taunts ny-
labo backed after the girl

  carter came last of all keeping anxious
watch over his shoulder the attack on
the safari failed to make sense why had
it begun why had it ended so abruptly
he thought of the dart and the poisoned
arrow and smiled grimly

  he had been shot at and missed too
many times for some reason someone
wanted him to live but they also wanted
him cut off from all the rest of civilized
mankind

ii

the huge red ball of fire that was the
sun had long since plunged into the
cool depths of the distant mist-tipped hills
for a long time the only sound had been
the snap and crackle of the flames over
which nylabo was cooking the hind quar-
ter of an eland that carter had shot just
red rogue killer



before dark had closed down then the
swiftly rising night wind began to carry
sounds there was a slithering ripple in
the tall veldt grass a night bird screamed
overhead there was a deep-bellied roar
of a lion that had missed his kill

  the girl studied the dubious shelter of
the thorn boma in which they were camped
and shuddered slightly this wasnt cape-
town or cairo or even nairobi with its
long rows of eucalyptus trees and hotels
and clubs and government buildings this
was an africa that she had never known
a malignantly - alive green hell in which
life was held cheaply and the only law was
the oldest law of self-survival kill or be
killed

  but why she demanded of carter if
the red-bearded black god is barney should
his men attack us why would he en-
danger my life

  his eyes red rimmed with fatigue car-
ter stared at her coldly across the fire i
dont know he said shortly i dont
even know that the red-bearded black god
is barney sutliff it still doesnt make
sense if he is he got to his feet stiffly
i do know that i wish that you had stayed
at katumbo as i told you to before this
affair is over ill have enough on my mind
without taking care of you

  ellen flushed and looked down at her
rifle and there is no chance of outside
help

  help from whom carter scoffed
three-fourths of the district and border
patrols have been dispensed with and
you couldnt get maastrict or ismail or
any of that white-bellied river station crew
up into the back country for all the gold
and ivory in the congo thats why they
hire fools like me they suck our brain
and bodies dry then toss us aside for
younger men

  for the moment he hated the congo
he hated all of africa the very lush
richness of its veldts and mountains and
jungles made men greedy and greedy
men were cruel

  im going outside to take a look-see
he told nylabo you kaka and
ndembi he ordered two of the soldiers
come outside with me

  the men left the boma unwillingly
night had found them far out on the veldt
on the bank of a small stream sundown

of the next day would bring them to his
camp on the ngesi from the camp on
the ngesi there would still be ten days of
hard paddling before they reached carters
almost inaccessible upriver station in the
mist-covered hills near the valley of the
lost ones	

  he circled the boma thoughtfully then
returned to stand at the gate kaka and
ndembi crouching behind him the whites
of their eyes rolling wildly in the moon-
light of death they were not afraid it
was something a man could understand
but they were bang vir die spoke

  the whimpering ghosts of dead men
were known to haunt the campfires at
which they had warmed their bones for at
least the space of two moons after they
had died and many men had died that
day

  carter tried to marshal his thoughts and
his tired mind flew off at tangents his
station the work of ten years his test
tubes and his cultures might all be de-
stroyed by the time that he returned for
all that he had accomplished in katumbo
he might better never have made the out-
trek

h e pounded a clenched fist in his palm
but why what was it all about
why was he being saved for what
the kraal burnings and the thefts and the
murders and the mysteriously vanished
villagers failed to make sense this wasnt
intertribal war this was extermination

  his mind returned to the profit motive
the price of ivory was down but there
was gold lots of it in the congo and gold
was thirty-five dollars an ounce more
fabulous prices were being paid for cattle
by the military garrisons on both coasts

  then too there were the tribes them-
selves despite all the edicts against it a
thriving slave trade still flourished in-
credible as it seemed in a world where
men were fighting and dying for the four
freedoms there still were slave markets
in africa and arabia where a young slave
in full strength sold for a hundred thalers
the small veins in his temple began to
beat as he recalled nylabos translation of
the dying masais last words 

  each day they were tortured that the
red-bearded black god might laugh when
life had almost left them they were yolked
	jungle

as slaves in a long line of captive men and
women

  a rippling in the tali grass brought his
mind back sharply to the present the at-
tack had not been resumed but he knew
the whole safari knew that they had been
followed the remaining porters and sta-
tion soldiers were sullenly rebellious they
would have left him if they had dared
they claimed and rightly so that they
could not fight a death they could not see
but death lay between them and katumbo
there was no way to go but onward

  the rippling in the grass grew more
pronounced whatever it was it wasnt
human there was too much disturbance
it was most likely carter thought a bull
elephant strayed from the herd or per-
haps a nocturnal hippo enroute to a wal-
lowing hole in the stream on which they
were camped

  he cursed himself for not having picked
up a rifle before he had left the boma
dont shoot he ordered kaka and
ndembi i think that its only a hippo
on his way to a water hole

  as he spoke the wide spreading black
boss of horn of a shaggy gray bull buffalo
parted the grass his little pig eyes were
red with murderous lust and his distended
nostrils dripping blood as he stared at the
three men and the boma

  dont shoot carter repeated sharply

  he spoke too late ndembis gun was
already at his shoulder this was a danger
he could see as the rifle cracked behind
him carter groaned slate like fragments
had shattered from the horn the hard
horn covered the brains there were only
three vulnerable spots the nose the shoul-
der and the throat

  lower in the nose he cried

  more slate flew from the horn kakas
gun a huge-bored old fashioned 
gibbs was roaring now he too was
shooting high then the bull lowered his
head and charged at the three men and
the boma carter sidestepped swiftly
shouting a warning to ellen and nylabo
as the charging bull passed him he emptied
his  into his neck in a futile effort to
turn him

  ndembi screamed once and died his
entrails spilling from his body as the huge
beast impaled him and charged on to level
the thorn boma to the ground screaming

stories

with fear and calling on kromanti and
gedeonsu to save them the soldiers and
bearers swarmed from the boma like ants
and ran blindly into the veldt grass

  carter had a quick glance of ellen and
nylabo as they stood beside the fire ny-
labo had just hurled his assegai and was
stomping out the fire

twenty yards beyond the spot where
the boma had once stood the pain-
maddened bull turned and stood pawing
the turf and regarding the golden haired
girl standing slim and erect in the moon
light

  run climb a tree carter shouted
hes going to charge you

  still clutching her heavy manlicher the
girl seemed rooted to the ground as the
bull charged

  nylabo was fumbling in the moonlight
for a rifle dropped by one of the frightened
houssa but the girl was between him
and the bull carter snatched the gibbs
from kakas hands and raced across the
clearing

  ellen had sidestepped the bull as
gracefully as a matador performing a
veronica but the pain-insane beast had
wheeled again

  carter thumbed the fresh shells into the
gun that kaka had pressed into his hand
and knelt between the bull and ellen
aiming carefully as the buffalos huge
bulk began to move he put five slugs into
the beasts muzzle everyone of the slugs
struck home the old-fashioned  gibbs
had a muzzle velocity of two tons but
for all his shots worried the bull carter
might have been using bird shot

  the bloody muzzle charged closer at
express train speed the shaggy head
with its great spread of horns dropped
down for the kill he was only feet from
the man now carter could read murder
in the blood-shot eyes-then a heavy gun
rocked behind him the huge beast stopped
as if he had run into a stone wall the
shaggy gray body shuddered dropped to
its knees and rolled over on its side pin-
ning carters legs before he could scramble
free

  nylabo pulled him out from underneath
the brute death come very close he
spat in obvious admiration you are
truely big juju bwana
red rogue killer



  you made the juju carter told the
blond girl soberly

  she reloaded the manlicher ive shot
since i was a child she blinked rapidly
to keep from crying barney taught me
how

  at any rate i was wrong about you
he admitted you wont need much tak-
ing care of you can take care of your-
self

  his eyes black with hate nylabo tugged
at carters sleeve look lord bwana
he pointed a tawny finger at the dead
beasts muzzle

  i will be damned carter pushed his
helmet back on his head cupped a lighted
match in his hands and squatted beside
the bull three of the five slugs he had
fired were visible in the muzzle scarcely
embedded in the flesh carter demanded
a fresh shell from kaka and pried out the
lead with his knife it was small wonder
the slugs had failed to stop the bull
where did you get these shells he
asked

  the frightened houssa  told him
catcnum bwana ismail belong give him
long side station all boys catch shells
same time

  carter picked up a gun from the ground
and extracted the lead from a second shell
the houssa was not lying the second
shell was the same it had been tampered
with for some reason of his own the
snag-toothed arab had sent the escort and
the porters out to die with scarcely enough
powder in their shells to propel the lead
from their gun barrels

  he stared back down the trail through
the dark he had a score to settle with
ismail but that could wait right now
he had business with a red-bearded killer
who called himself a black god

forms grew in the moonlight around

him as one by one the bearers and the
station soldiers bang vir die spoke and
frightened by the creeping night things in
the tall veldt grass straggled back into the
ruined camp seeking safety in numbers
and in bzvana jujus known magical
powers

  when nylabo counted noses four of the
porters and two of the houssa had van-
ished whether they had run awray or
been killed they had no way of knowing

it was plain now however that the great
bull buffalo had been deliberately herded
across the veldt until it had charged their
camp

  the damage done was difficult to esti-
mate it could well cost them their lives
most of their provisions had been scat-
tered over the veldt or trampled under-
foot if they pushed on they would have
to live off the land and contrary to pop-
ular belief once they reached the land of
the great forest game would be scarce

  better so make strong mouti bwana
juju nylabo advised him soberly else
we all go to the place of dying

 carter shrugged the houssa had
summed it up when they had said that they
could not fight what they could not see
and no amount of the medical knowledge
that had established his reputation would
serve as a shield against a bullet or the
charge of a maddened beast

  hours perhaps minutes would count
now well pack and trek he told ny-
labo line up the safari as best you can
well rest when we reach the ngesi
nylabo padded off in the moonlight and
began to kick the frightened weary porters
to their feet

  carter told off a detail to gather up
ndembis remains and bury them then
crossed to the scattered fire that ellen was
rebuilding were going on he told
her well eat when we reach the ngesi
from there in its going to be even tougher
sledding that it has been but at least
well be on the river 

  he broke off sharply as a short-shafted
arrow smacked into the trunk of the thorn
tree beside him quivering like a thing
alive ellen opened her mouth to sound
an alarm he stopped her by pointing to
a ribbon of white that dangled from the
shaft of the arrow

  a message

  from the black god no doubt carter
said grimly

  he wrenched the arrow from the tree
and examined the head it was not stained
with poison crudely printed on the white
ribbon in red berry juice or blood was the
curt message

  doctor ccuter

    send the girl back to katumbo with
  ail of your escort excepting nylabo
  you have my word she will not be
	jungle

  harmed then proceed to your up-
  river station where further instructions
  will await you you have been
  warned disregard this warning and
  the- next poisoned kalchi dart that is
  fired at you will not miss this is
  your first and your last warning

  the message was unsigned carter
handed it to ellen would you say that
your brother wrote that

  her eyes grew haunted as she fingered
the piece of silk i cant tell she ad-
mitted its printed but the silk that
it is printed on has been cut from a para-
chute

  thats what i thought he said grimly
ellen read the message again i had
better go back she said quietly i have
no right to endanger your life

  he pointed out but that could be a
trap to split our party i believe that it
is youd never reach katumbo

  her chin quivered but she insisted no
matter what happens to me there is no
reason that you should die i have been
stubborn bull-headed but if youll have
nylabo turn the safari around 

   carter put his fingers over his lips this
was a girl of whom a man could well be
proud for the first time he was glad she
was there were going on he told her
and were going on together until we
get at the bottom of this red-bearded black
god business

  she clung to him a moment her firm
young body close to his life was short
death was near and now that the wind
had died the hot black african night
pressed in on them like a shroud

ill

the distant mist-tipped hills and roll-
ing green slopes were not so distant
now the veldt grass had growm even
taller but the trail was well defined an-
other half hours trek would bring them
to the river the terror of the night of
crawling creeping unseen things had
passed it showed in the firm-stride of
the porters and the laughter of the alert
houssa as they brought up the rear

  a short half hour away were the savory
cooking pots of the great sprawling kavi-
riondo village in which bwana juju had

stories

left his up-river boys there would be
feasting and boasting and songs there
might even be a ngoma to celebrate the
attack that they had fought off in the jun-
gle from time to time a boy broke into
a few dance steps slapping his palm against
his rifle stock as though it was a drum

  matching her pace to carters ellen
said theyre just children

  carter glanced back along the trail
with mens responsibilities they may
think and act like children but they fight
and die like men he had not mentioned
the message shot into the thorn tree since
the night before what sort of a man is
your brother

  ellens eyes clouded slightly hes no
better and no worse than any other he
is adventurous hes had some trouble
with the law she blinked back tears
but i wont believe i cant believe that
he is the red-bearded black god

  back in katumbo you thought he might
be

  i have to know she said simply

  the chances are hes dead carter told
her quietly

  a few hundred yards farther on a great
bend in the river they were nearing formed
a water hole a cloud of scarlet and black
finks rose from the reeds blue and orange
kingfishers filled the air black-faced mon-
keys chattered angrily and climbed into
the trees a white hippo waded out deeper
into the water and lay with only its nos-
trils and eyes eexposed the wildebeeste
and young zebra took alarm with a great
pound of hoofbeats carter shot two wilde-
beeste nylabo ran down another and cut
its throat the fresh meat would be a
welcome addition to the feasting and the
dancing the boys anticipated

  when the safari was underway again
ellen spoke the question that had been in
her mind since she had met carter in
katumbo lean-faced burned to the color
of saddle leather by the sun quiet cap-
able steve carter was different than any
other man whom she had known he re-
minded her slightly of the statue of cecil
rhodes that she had seen in pretoria

  what are you doing in africa she
asked

  what am i doing

  yes

  carter packed his pipe and lit it its
red rogue killer



tlie usual story he said smiling i
havent sense enough to leave i came in
as a traveling doctor for a belgian syn-
dicate and stayed to take over a district
and ive been happy here africa is a
medical paradise it has every disease
known to mandkind and a few that havent
been named his eyes began to glow
its the richest most productive conti-
nent on earth but disease and ignorance
have held it back for centuries tens of
thousands of acres capable of supporting
millions of men and women support only
a handful of natives because of the tsetse
and black-water fever

  ellen laughed lightly i see youre
altruistic

  carter shook his head thats a ten
dollar word and im only a two thaler
doctor not that i ever collect he
grunted  draw a salary for getting out
the gold and ivory the doctoring is
thrown in free thats why the natives call
me bzvana juju

  he strode on ahead to have a few words
with nylabo he found the zulu studying
the trail

  men have passed this way within the
hour bwana nylabo told him he
pointed to a crushed tuft of grass not yet

the pain-maddened beast charged
	jungle

fully sprang back all were black but
one that one wore boots with heels
he pointed to a spoor too faint for carter
to see maybe better safari stop and ny-
labo go ahead

  carter considered despite their light-
ness of heart the porters and the houssa
were dog tired they had trekked almost
thirty-six hours with only a few hours
rest they were looking forward to reach-
ing the village how many men he
demanded the same gang that jumped
us outside of katumbo

  nylabo shook his head that no man
can tell bwana he studied the spoor
again but it was seven men who passed
and they were traveling with great speed

carter checked the safari mentally
he still had ten houssa and fourteen
porters all of the porters were armed
with the guns of the men who had died
they were only a few minutes trek from
a large village it was all clear country
from here in well push on he de-
cided

  aywah bwana 

  carter dropped back to the houssa
pausing beside ellen to tell her to make
certain that her gun was loaded its just
a precaution he told her i dont think
that theyd dare to jump us here but we
cant afford to take chances

  he took two shells from kakas bando-
lier pried the lead from both with his
knife poured the powder from one of them
into the other replaced the lead and
crimped it with his teeth

  can do

  the big black smiled white-toothed
can do

  then recharge all your shells and show
the others how to do it carter ordered
half a bandolier of proper shells is worth
a full bandolier of half shells that only
tickle a warriors ribs instead of send him
to the place of dying

  kaka passed among the houssa ex-
plaining they in turn helped the porters

  carter rejoined the girl now i feel
better but i should have thought of that
last night i guess that i must be slip-
ping

  she smiled at him half shyly killing
isnt a doctors business

  in africa he told her a doctor is

stories

just another man he does what he has
to do

  killing isnt a doctors business he
strode on silently the note preying on his
mind proceed to your up-river station
where further instructions will await you
whoever the man was he was out of his
mind to think that he could order him
around he doubted that it was barney
sutliff the famous soldier of fortune
was undoubtedly dead no man could
crash a plane in the valley of the lost
ones and walk out of it

 who was the man what game was
he playing what in the name of time
could a man who proclaimed himself a
red-bearded black god want of a back bush
doctor where did ismail come in why
had he passed out half filled shells was
it possible that the loot from the burned
villages was passing through katumbo
was that why maastrict had suggested
that a month or so in brazza-ville would
do him good that was difficult to be-
lieve still trade had come almost to a
standstill the company was merely
marking days off on the calender and hold-
ing on until normal times and the lush
rich virginity of africa made men greedy

  he froze in his tracks at the shot the
whole safari froze the porters and the
houssa black marble statues glistening with
sweat and carved from the rock of time
the shot was followed by a second then
a third then the drums began to pound

carter raced up the trail to nylabo
the zulu had just opened his mouth
to shout a dead village sentry lay in the
trail his limp body swarming with mur-
derous big siafu ants and his throat a
crimson gash from ear to ear carter felt
the flesh it still was warm the man had
been dead only a matter of minutes

  up the trail and across the river a ma-
chine gun began to stutter there was a
shrill screaming of women and children
an oily smoke rose through the belt of
trees that screened the stream

  ellen looked at the body and turned her
eyes away

  carter told off kaka to stay with her
the rest of you come on nylabo has
read the spoor and tells me that there are
only seven of them

  the houssa raced after him gleefully
red rogue killer	

boasting of the infidels that they would
kill and commending their souls to allah
the all-merciful and all-seeing the
porters followed at their heels comparing
themselves to bull elephants and tigers
as the zulu do this wras no night attack
by devils these were men armed as they
were armed with knives and guns and as-
segais

  nylabo ran easily without effort a hu-
man counterpart of the tawny leopard after
which he had been named it is a village
of three thousand fires bwana of at least
five hundred warriors not to speak of the
laioni or the half grown boys capable of
wielding spears thus is the end of all
evil men as with the great snake who tries
to swallow more than he can digest and is
easily captured by the laioni before he can
disgorge his prey

  carter hoped that he was right he
didnt like the sound of the hard dry bucket-
ing of the machine gun old trade mus-
kets knob kerries assegais and hide
shields were poor armor against hot lead
still if nylabo had read the spoor cor-
rectly it was five hundred odd men against
seven

  the screaming of the women and chil-
dren grew louder as they raced through
the belt of woods and down the bank to
the ford in the yellow river a good many
of the huts were on fire and a dense black
oily smoke screened the scene of the fight-
ing

  nylabo plunged into the water with car-
ter close behind

  when they had reached midstream in
the waist deep water a machine gun
on the far bank hemstitched a rifle of white
in red hot lead a few feet in front of them
it was suicide to go on

  carter fired at the unseen machine-gun-
ner and shouted for the houssa and the
armed porters to go back fan out in the
trees and get that gunner

  a ragged volley blasted over his head
the machine gun hemstitched again much
closer this time

  then a heavy gun boomed on the bank
and the black machine gunner leaped into
the air a second painted black tore the

 the zulu use the word tiger for leopard after the
 south afrikander or boer fashion

gun from his hands and raced on up the
far bank to disappear in the clouds of dust
and smoke that swirled in the village street

  nylabo forced himself through the wa-
ter in great surges the memsahib shoots
well he grinned wtere she of my color
and would her father sell her for such a
ndito would nylabo pay many cows

  carter had no time for comment three
huge bakussu warriors painted in alter-
nate stripes of red and white had rushed
down the slippery mud bank into the water
to meet them one of them raised his
arm and a hurled assegai grazed carters
cheek he shot the bakussu between the
eyes and grappled with a second warrior
who was trying to brain him with a knob
kerrie

  nylabo deftly disembowled the third
bakussu then broke the shaft of his as-
segai across his knees lest he be tempted to
use it as a throwing spear

  the warrior with whom carter strug-
gled stank of rancid oil and sweat they
strained body to body slipping skidding
almost falling on the muddy bottom nei-
ther man able to use his weapon then
carter saw the mans eyes and knew where
his strength came from the pupils of the
bakussus eyes were contracted to pin
points the eyes themselves were blank and
slately the bakussu had been drugged
into a state where he knew neither fear
nor pain

he fought on grimly the bakussus
drugged condition could explain why
seven men had dared to attack five hun-
dred the red-bearded black god was
fiendishly clever he worked on the same
theory that the mad mullahs of afghanis-
stan used when they sent drugged and re-
ligion inflamed ghazzi out to die for al-
lah and in so doing break an opening in
the enemys ranks for the main body to
pour through

  a thought pounded through his mind as
he fought to free his hand and sink the
muzzle of his gun into the straining black
belly that was trying to force him back
into deep water

  three of the seven were dead but the
fighting in the village streets still contin-
ued swarms of painted warriors were
diving in and out of huts putting all the
aged to the sword or the spear and driv-
	jungle

ing the young both male and female be-
fore them back into the inferno of smoke
they had been tricked this was no war
party of seven there were hundreds of
men in the attack

  he twisted his right hand free and
blasted three  slugs into the bakussus
belly the dying warrior staggered and
fell then drifted out on an eddy into a
stagnant pool already crimson with blood
and lashed white by the pound of mighty
tails

  his superbly muscled body gleaming
with water nylabo stood ankle deep in
the mud of the bank and spat they are
skelm they left a spoor for us to find
of but their smallest party while the main
bodies of warriors closed in from the other
three sides

  carter nodded curtly so it would
seem

  it was too late now for regrets

  the houssa had forded the river and
were clicking their knives against their
barrels cheerfully as they awaited the order
to charge

  helped by kaka ellen clambered drip-
ping up the bank

  her blue eyes were blazing as she pointed
into the inferno what are we wait-
ing for those painted fiends are killing
women and children

  carter made his decision the drugged
warriors could not feel pain but they could
die and a savage attacked was not half
so dangerous as an attacking savage

 spread out as skirmishers he
ordered make every bullet count but do
not advance any further than the first row
of huts until the wind blows the smoke
away so we can see what we are doing

  the houssa advanced to do battle shout-
ing allah akbar there is no god but
allah

  a sudden hushed lull in the fighting
followed

  then a loud and unreal voice bellowed
from the smoke

  the children of the prophet lie there
is no god in the congo but the red-bearded
black god returned from the valley of the
lost ones and this say i unto you truly
all who fail to worship and obey him must
as surely go to the place of dying as the
kypee bird picks vermin from the hide of
tembu

stories

           iv

arter looked sharply at ellen

  her eyes were agonized i cant
tell if its barney she told him but if
it is hes done something to his voice its
hard mechanical unreal

  you black god carter called i
want to talk to you

  a burst of laughter answered you
were warned the bull voice bellowed
there will be no second warning the
voice seemed to increase in power until
it beat like a flexible mallet against the
drums of the ears of all who heard it the
tabu is lifted bwana juju i black god
say that you may die but the time for
death is not yet and as for the fair haired
golden one we will make a priestess of her
to serve before our shrine

  a howling of warriors echoed the pro-
nouncement it was unreal incredible in-
sane in the ten years he had spent in
africa carter had never heard anything
like it this is a nightmare he decided
im dreaming this ill wake up back at
the station-

  the bucketing of the machine gun and
the death yell of a houssa cut him short
this was real

  he ordered the men and ellen to fling
themselves on the ground while he and
nylabo tried to outflank the gun they
failed the black god wasnt taking any
chances by the time that they reached
the hut from which the gun had been fir-
ing the gunner had moved farther back
into the flames and smoke

  nylabo wanted to push on

  no carter stopped him thats
what they want us to do once we got
inside that smoke we wouldnt have a
chance

  they returned to the line on the bank
and hugging the ground the whole line
moved forward taking what cover they
could until they were only ten yards from
the first row of blazing huts

  her white face streaked with dirt and
her golden hair tumbling out of her hel-
met down around her shoulders ellen re-
fused to leave carters side if it is
barney hes mad she reasoned if he
isnt barney hes a fiend and id rather
die with you than fall into their hands
a ricocheting bullet screamed off a rock
red rogue killer



to burn across carters cheek a heavy-
burst of lead interspersed with thrown
assegais followed

  a spear quivered in the ground an inch
from carters shoulder a blow gun dart
thudded into his helmet the tabu had
been lifted

  xylabo got to one knee discarding his
rifle and clutching his stabbing assegai
they come bwana through the
smoke

  as he shouted a wave of wild-eyed
painted warriors burst through the screen
of smoke

  there was a crackle of shots down the
line and a slow methodical booming of
the blond girls manlicher each time
she fired she rubbed her fragile shoulder
where the recoil of the heavy gun had
bruised it

  a dozen warriors fell twenty more
raced on clutching short-bladed stabbing
assegais already red with blood the
porters so recently made soldiers broke
and ran for the river screaming the
houssa stood their ground they emptied
their guns calmly then without time to
reload threw them from them and rose
up snatching thrown assegais still quiver-
ing in the ground and charged forward
shouting allah allah akbar

  carter thrust ellen behind him as a
huge brute inflamed with drugs grasped
at her hair with bloody hands the big
black stabbed at his throat but carter
stepped in under the blow and jabbed up
sharply with his gun butt the steel butt
plate caught the black under the chin and
broke his neck

  as he stepped back panting wiping the
sweat from his eyes he saw nylabo put
his foot on a dead kikuyus face and
wrench his assegai from the breast bone
of the man wrhom he had just killed

  so fought my fathers and my fathers
fathers in the days of the great chaka he
told carter cheerfully the amazulu
were a mighty nation and while chaka
was no god all men wrere the kings dogs
killing at his nod

  ellen saw the blood on carters cheek
and mopped at it with a handkerchief
youre hurt

  its only a burn he assured her and
it came from a richocheting slug and not

-jungle stories-spring

a dart he picked the poisoned dart from
his helmet shuddering slightly

  what in the name of time had he got
into his business was healing not kill-
ing it seemed this nightmare would never
end each progressive step grew worse
the wave of warriors who had charged
them were dead brave now the porters
had returned and were chanting of their
prowess he studied the faces of the dead
the dying massai had told the truth
these were not men of one nation be-
neath the paint he could recognize swahili
masai kavironda kikuyu wakambas
moroni bakussu and even a few renegade
houssa they were a motley swarm
made up of many tribes

nylabo studied the smoking village
the throb of the drums had long
since ceased the shouting and the wail-
ing of the women and the children had
grown faint the smoke had grown less
dense as the thatched huts had stopped
smouldering and given themselves to the
flame already the aasvogels the great
stinking birds of carrion in this fruitful
land where life was cheap were beginning
to circle the village in anticipation of their
feast

  black god carter shouted

  his voice was rolled back by the forest
in a mocking echo there was no an-
swer the sounds of battle and the
screaming had given way to a deadly si-
lence

  he strode across the clearing and into
the village street only the dead and the
dying remained at the far end of the
mud street hard packed by many feet to
cement-like consistency he could see the
last of a long thin line of men and women
yolked together winding through the trees
as he watched twenty or thirty painted
warriors forming the rear guard of the
slave train turned and shook their assegais
in a last gesture of defiance

  it was useless to follow them they
were too few four of the houssa and
six of the porters were dead five more
were badly wounded

  the houssa began to flne-comb the huts

  now what ellen demanded

  ill be damned if i know carter told
her my guess is that if we can find an
undamaged canoe or dug-out wed best
	jungle

push on up-river at least i know the
tribes up there

  he told off most of the porters as burial
parties and sent two of them back for one
of the wildebeeste after they had eaten
they would search for a canoe

  nylabo kicked a scattered cooking fire
together and began to boil a great pot of
mealies while carter and ellen walked
among the wounded and the dying doing
what little they could do	

  an aged black recognized carter and
stretched out his thin whithered arms
bwana juju

 carter knelt beside him the aged
blacks eyes were already beginning to
glaze you saw him old man he asked
quietly you saw this red-bearded black
god

  no bwana the villager told him it
is said that few men have seen him his
warriors fight directed by his voice which
he throws from a great distance while he
himself sits on a gold throne in the valley
of the lost ones

  carter passed his hand across his eyes
the deeper he got into the affair the more
incredible it seemed there was clever
chicanery here whoever the man was he
was playing on all the known superstitions
of the bush

  he took his pocket case from his shirt
filled a syringe with a morphine solution
and plunged it into the old mans arm to
ease his dying what tales are told of
this black god  he asked

  the old man took a brief grip on life
it is said that he came out of the blue
bwana juju in a great silver bird that
made much sound and many warriors
of many tribes now serve him for they
know no dying in his service and he gives
them dreams of paradise on earth

  carter translated what he had said

ellen stifled a sob i cant believe it
of barney what does he hope to gain
ivory and gold and slaves carter re-
plied he turned to question the old man
further but he was lifeless

                                  ft

back on the street nylabo reported
 the village gold and ivory cache stored
up to barter for trade goods had obvi-
ously been broken into and looted more
the departing raiders had driven off all
the cattle

stories

  its a racket and a good one carter
told the girl your brother must have
made thousands so far

  i dont believe it she said hotly i
still dont believe that its barney and
i wont believe it until-

  an excited shout from kaka cut her
short bwana juju quickly come here
in the elders hut we have found a bound
and gagged roinek in the uniform of the
selikali

  theyve found an english soldier
carter translated for ellen followed by
the girl he strode rapidly down the street
to the communal hut that the flames had
spared

  the houssa had released the man a
big man six feet and more florid-faced
and dressed in the uniform of an officer
of the kings african rifles he stared
at carter and ellen suspiciously spoke
with a clipped british accent

i say might i ask who you are
im doctor steve carter carter told
him ive charge of the valley of the
lost ones district for the jandeers syn-
dicate out of bruges and you-

  the other man fumbled in his pocket
found a monocle and screwed it into his
eye before admitting ive heard of you
and favbly he strode forward one
lean hard hand extended forgive the
nawsty suspicions i thought that you
might be one of the gang that jumped me
but i see now that youre not thanks
a million old man and all that sort of
thing i guess id have been a smoked
goose by now if it hadnt been for you and
your boys

  carter shook hands and your name
the other man clicked his heels and
bowed slightly from the waist captain
dinwoody dennis of the kings african
rifles at your service he smiled
broadly at ellen

  carter had been through too much for
his mind to function clearly this was the
last straw and what in the name of
time he demanded is an officer of the
kings african rifles doing bound and
gagged in a blazing native village in the
heart of the belgian congo

  the smile faded from captain dennis
face youve a right to ask he opened
a pocket of his tunic and handed a sheaf
of crisp official-looking papers to carter
red rogue killer



i believe that youll find them in order
he hesitated continued i came here in
search of proof of the death of two men
color flooded his face and i had the
bloody misfortune to run into this specter
of the jungle this foul red-bearded black
beggar who calls himself a god

  youve seen him then ellen almost
screamed

  i have captain dennis assured her
whats more hes the beggar im after
a chap by the name of barney sutliff
ellen gasped oh the color drain-
ing from her face carter caught her as
she fainted

  captain dennis removed his monocle
his eyes bright with concern i beg your
pardon did i say something wrong
why are you after sutliff carter
evaded the question

  the story that captain dennis told him
wasnt pleasant a notorious south afri-
can bushranger and outlaw a known nazi
sympathizer by the name of cort wolf
had been sentenced to life imprisonment
on- the rand for murder he had escaped
somehow and had contacted sutliff sut-
liff had agreed to fly him to cairo for a
certain sum the two men had last been
seen south of lake tanganyika the plane
had not reached stanleyville where both
belgian and english officers had been
waiting for the precious pair the as-
sumption was that the plane had crashed
and captain dennis had been sent to con-
firm the assumption

  i found the plane about ten days trek
from here he concluded grimly and
i found cort wolfs body make a men-
tal note of that should something happen
to me he continued grimly then i
safaried in here this morning on my way
to katumbo and ran into this bloody hell
i hadnt been here an hour before those
bloody devils jumped us and dont think
for one moment that this sutliff is a mad
man hes as sane as you or me and
hes cleaning up a fortune on gold and
ivory and slaves

  still holding the unconscious girl carter
filled his pipe with one hand there were
a dozen questions that he wanted to ask
but they could wait he still had his
wounded houssa and porters to attend to

  and what do you intend to do now
he asked quietly

  get sutliff if i die in the attempt
his face grim captain dennis added and
hell undoubtedly try to get me you see
theres this other thing now xand im
the only witness against him ive seen
him face to face and i know that he is the
monster who is posing as this red-bearded
black god youre heading where from
here old man

  to the valley of the lost ones
dennis extended his hand again then
if i may ill go with you

  ill be glad to have you carter said
sincerely the girl in his arms moaned
slightly as consciousness began to return
but do me a favor dennis soft peddle
the fact that you know that barney sutliff
is the red-bearded black god

  captain dennis drew himself up stiffly
oh i say now why-

  because this is ellen sutliff his sis-
ter carter told him quietly

  the captains already florid face grew
scarlet

  oh i say now he said i do say i
am frightfully sorry and all that sort of
thing

v

steadily day after day the banks
of the ngesi had narrowed the
water had become less muddy the current
grown swifter now in places the pad-
dlers had to bend their backs double against
the frothing water that sought to sweep
the big canoe down stream or dash it
against one of the sharp edged rocks that
rose from the river bed as if to bar the
way into the valley of the lost ones

  here the leafy branches of huge trees
met overhead to form an eerie green tun-
nel black faced monkeys scampered
through the branches large gaudily
plumed birds screamed raucously long
gray warted crocodiles lay in the shallows
and back-waters watching the progress of
the canoe with smaljl evil blood-red eyes
several times they heard great beasts they
could not see crashing through the under-
brush

  in places where the river widened they
could see that they were among the foot
hills over all hung a shimmering vapor
of opalescent mist outside of the chat-
tering of the monkeys and the screaming
	jungle

of the many birds the silence was profound

  it is like being in a church whose ceil-
ing is the sky ellen confided to carter
soberly its like moving through some
prehistoric world that mankind has not yet
discovered

  his uniform shirt black with sweat
captain dennis feathered his paddle how
much farther

  well reach the station by night car-
ter told him

  he was worried he had been worried
for days his eyes tried again and again
to pierce the green wall that hemmed them
in he had a feeling that they were being
watched it had persisted for days nights
he had insisted that they camp on sand
spits in the middle of the river he was
beginning to wonder if they had been wise
in pushing on to the up-river station it
might perhaps have been better to have
struck south toward kabola or kanda
kanda still he owed a duty - to his na-
tives they trusted in depended on him

  as they rounded a bend in the river
they caught their first sight of man since
leaving the burned kikuyu village they
upped the beat of the paddles but before
they could reach him he had stepped back
into the green wall later signal drums
began to pound

  dennis mopped sweat from his florid
face what name people this place he
asked nylabo

  akesi the zulu grunted he had
taken an active dislike to the captain noth-
ing that carter could say would move
him

  so dennis raised one eyebrow
leopard men eh

  theyre a zoomorphic tribe carter
admitted but they arent real leopard
men at least we havent had an outbreak
in the ten years that ive been here

  i dont trust any natives dennis
scowled give them an inch and theyll
cut your throat

  ellen moved closer to carter her eyes
were wide with wonder those drums-
he shook his head theyre nothing
to worry about those arent war drums
he chuckled thats only jungle west-
ern union that akesi sentry who spotted
us just informing the village that bwana
juju is returning

  she laughed but her eyes remained wor-

stories

ried it sounds more like a party line
to me

  they began to pass cultivated fields that
had been carved out of the jungle and
planted to manioc the women working
in the fields looked up shyly the warriors
guarding them raised their assegais in
greeting and shouted jambo bwana
juju

  the fear left ellens eyes they like
you theyre glad to see you

  home town boy returns after losing
his shirt in the bloody jungle captain
dennis said dryly what did you do to
make them like you so go native
nylabo looked up sharply his tawny
eyes slitted with hate he did not like this
british bwana both his words and his
fists wrere hard several times he had
struck at him and cursed him for no other
reason he could see but that his skin was
of another color

  no carter shrugged i merely treat
them like human beings its a good policy
in the congo

  dennis exploded bah what all blacks
need is a taste of the whip and often
he scowled at nylabos back that boy
of yours for example if he were mine
id teach him to step lively and keep a civil
tongue in his head with a well laid on
fifty kibokos lashes

  wah nylabo laid down his paddle
and reached for his short hafted assegai
the houssa whooped with excitement
stop it carter ordered sharply get
back to your paddling nylabo and you
quit riding nylabo captain dennis were
all overstrained weve been through too
much we arent ourselves

  im myself dennis said coldly but
he resumed his paddling

it was difficult for carter to understand
the man he had grown more arrogant
and overbearing with each rising sun he
had failed to do his share of the paddling
he had insisted that nylabo wait on him
more carter did not like the way that
the englishman looked at ellen he hoped
that he would not have trouble with him
but he was afraid that he would he had
seen other men too small for africa go
cafard here there were no half way
measures africa either made a man or
broke him
red rogue killer	

late that afternoon they put in at the
akesi village only a few miles below
the station carter was relieved to find
it standing the villagers were glad to
see him cooking fires were lighted
gourds of palm toddy were proffered
swarms of naked children followed him
up the street jambo bwana juju was
echoed from all sides comely full-
breasted akesian girls wearing bright
colored prints and calicoes wound about
their bodies joked and laughed with the
houssa and openly admired ellens hair

  theyre pretty she said smiling
they could be arab women

  he explained that they were on the old
slave trail that for years the akesi witch
doctors had purchased their vestal virgins
from the slavers as a result the tribe
was a mixture of arab wahuma ora-
savo and half-caste arabeezi blood why
the red-bearded black god has left this
tribe alone ill never know either hes
saving them for his final clean-up or hes
afraid of them

  dennis snorted rot from what ive
seen hes not afraid of anyone

  carter shrugged and proceeded to his
business with the chief after an hours
hard bargaining and by payment of most
of the trade goods he had salvaged he ar-
ranged for two dozen warriors to accom-
pany him to the station and on into the
valley of the lost ones when he had or-
ganized his safari

  as he rose to return to the river ny-
labo touched his arm and told him that
mpembi wished to see him

  the aged witch doctors hut was on the
far edge of the village set apart from the
others a black male leopard skin covered
the doorway

  mpembi a wrinkled black gray with
great age sat on a mat in front of the
hut casting his knuckle bones in the dust
and looking from time to time into the
grotesquely shaped earthen pit which he
claimed contained the souls of the lost
ones with whom he communed

  the old man was not an akesi in the
days when he had had teeth they had been
filed he boasted that in his youth dur-
ing the red rubber days of the congo he
had been the chief of a cannibal tribe that
had never tasted other flesh but that which
had come from man

  jambo ancient carter greeted him
gravely

  jambo bwana juju the old man an-
swered your mouti is of the body and
does much good but mpembi reads a
warning in the pot he stretched out a
clawlike hand you give mpembi tom-
bacco

  carter placed a can of snuff in the
wrinkled hand what is it mpembi
would tell me

  ellen watched fascinated as the old man
cast the bones captain dennis who had
strolled up behind them repeated rot
weve no time for witch craft if youve
made arrangements for your boys lets be
on our way

  in a moment

  miffed dennis strode back to the land-
ing appraising the comely features of the
women whom he passed

  mpembi stared after him thoughtfully
then passed his wrinkled hand over the
pot and a greenish vapor spiraled up like
some disembodied serpent

   ellens fingers tightened on carters arm

  you come from katumbo bwana
juju mpembi said finally death has
followed your safari many men have
died

  nylabo squatted on his heels at a re-
spectful distance aywah he said in
awe

  anyone could guess that ellen said
uncertainly lets go

  wait

  mpembi passed his hand over the pot
again and the green vapor turned to red

  aywah he droned much blood was
spilled in a great kikuyu village where the
banks of the ngesi are wide and the water
is colored yellow i see smoke and flames
and dying i hear the screaming of women
and children i see a long slave train of
young men and women yolked together
and guarded by painted warriors

  nylabo rocked on his heels aywah
mpembi is a mighty smeller out of men

  and the warning carter demanded

the old mans thin body quivered like
a leaf whipped by the wind the
past is not finished yet bwana he peered
into the pot intently i can see a white
man with a great voice who falsely pro-
claims that he is a god and black of skin
	jungle

he came out of the sky this man in a
great silver bird with a broken wing and
the men of his race believe him dead
thats a lie ellen cried hotly bar-
ney isnt the black god he isnt you
-youre just pinning these crimes onto
him because its the easiest thing to do
her nerves shattered by the bloodshed she
had witnessed and the long trek up river
she began to cry

  carter attempted to take her by the
shoulders ellen you dont understand
you-

  she shrugged herself free dont touch
me

  before he could stop her she ran swiftly
along the street to the landing climbed
into the canoe where she sat sobbing

  captain dennis attempted to console her
she told him to go away he shrugged
and paced the crude landing whistling a
popular air

  go on mpembi carter said

  the aged black picked up the pot and
stared into it the spiral of vapor coiling
up on either side of his gray poll like horns
the bwana juju is being deceived he
announced finally a man whom he trusts
is not worthy

  how much the old man read out of the
pot and how much he had learned by some
mysterious telepathy of his own carter
never was able to decide but in africa
strange things happened and his warn-
ings were always sound the man whom
he trusted could be either ismail or maas-
trict the black god had to have an out-
let for his gold and ivory and slaves

  nylabo asked you can read this mans
name oh wizard

  wah the old man bobbed his head
i have no need to read it the lost ones
have whispered it in my ear his name is
spoken plainly as-

  he broke off to slap at his wrinkled fore-
head but the object that he slapped at
only sank the deeper the circle of watch-
ers pushed forward curious then a moan
rose from the crowd with a gigantic ef-
fort of will mpembi had plucked the thing
from his forehead and held it up for all to
see it was a poisoned kalchi dart shot
from a blow-gun

  nylabo leaped to his feet his eyes
searching the leaves of the trees that over-
looked the hut the men in the circle

stories

around the wizard ran shouting for their
weapons deep in the heart of the village
war drums began to throb

  carter knelt beside the witch doctor
his name-

  his name bwana juju  the old man
said with an effort his name is- the
powerful poison surged through his body
holding him rigid a moment then his tooth-
less chin sank on his chest he was dead

a shrill scream that rose above the
shouting of the warriors and the
pulsing throb of the drum brought carter
to his feet it was ellen screaming from
the river

  a hundred voices echoed the shrill
scream the black god the black god
is attacking from the river

  a ragged burst of shots rippled from
the landing as a large war canoe grounded
in the mud and thirty painted warriors
leaped out

  the houssa and the porters had fol-
lowed their white bwana into the village
to ogle the girls except for a few curious
children ellen and captain dennis had
been alone at the landing

  carter raced for the river knowing that
he would be too late it was one man
against thirty the warriors were ignor-
ing the village and the on-rushing akesi to
concentrate on dennis he was the center
of a milling shouting mob who were beat-
ing at him with knob-kerries and thrusting
with assegais

  carter heard his gun bark six times
but long before he could come within ac-
curate shooting distance without fear of
hitting ellen the savages had overpowered
dennis and had thrust him with ellen
into their canoe that was now surging on
up river white water curling from twenty
flashing paddles

  there were no canoes left in which to
follow the black gods men had seen to
that all of the akesi canoes at the land-
ing had been smashed carter ran a few
feet along the river bank tripped on a
thick vine and fell he got to his feet
cursing his gun barrel jammed with mud

  then a man rose in the stern of the
canoe even under the masking paint that
streaked his nude body and face carter
recognized ismail the arab

  in the name of god peace be with you
the arab jeered thanks for bringing
red rogue killer



the golden one so far the black god
thanks you

  what else he said was lost the canoe
swept around a bend in the river and was
gone

  carter trudged wearily back to the land-
ing his mind confused ismails presence
this high on the river could mean much
it could mean that sutliff had finished with
his raids that he had made his pile and
was getting out while the getting was still
good he doubted that sutliff mad or
sane would harm his sister but he knew
what would happeen to dennis the eng-
lishman turned over to the drug inflamed
renegades of many tribes would be tor-
tured until he died

  he stared glumly at the ground all
he could do was organize a safari and fol-
low ellens face rose before him and he
winced she had been so certain that her
brother was not the black god he prayed
that she would be safe

  in the short twelve days that he had
known her he had grown more fond of
ellen than he had realized she was a fit
mate for a jungle man she too loved the
jungle even if she feared it

  nylabo his tawny skin glistening with
sweat broke into his brief meditation
lord bwana-

  yes-

  bwana dennis struggled fiercely he
shot many times with his gun until it was
empty the painted warriors beat him
with their knob-kerries and stabbed him
with their assegais

  they did many times carter looked
at the zulu puzzled you saw it he
put up a darn good fight before he was
overpowered

  aywah bzvana the zulu answered
but here is very strange magic his
keen eyes swept the landing and the
churned up mud when men fight to the
death they bleed and nowhere can ny-
labo see blood

  carters eyes followed nylabos

  there was no blood on the landing
there was no blood in the mud the pre-
tended struggle had been faked dennis
had been one-of the gang

  that was why he had returned to the
landing

  that was why mpembi had been killed
captain dennis had been the man to whom

he had been about to name and whoever
the florid faced man was he wasnt captain
dennis of the kings african rifles he
was an impostor a fake he was traveling
with either forged or stolen papers

vi

dawn of the following day tinted the
hills with crimson nylabo who had
searched all night found the spoor where
the attacking party had left the river there
were thirty men in the party traveling
fast the small imprint of ellens heels
were plain in the soft mud of the bank

  he waited for the rest of the safari to
join him then followed the spoor to a trail
that wound down through the hills into
the mist shrouded valley it was a perfect
hide-out except for the black gods own
men their senses dulled by drugs and the
akesi themselves dabblers in black magic
there were perhaps in all the congo no
other tribes who would dare to enter the
valley

  the remaining kikuyu porters deserted
in a body as carter made his preparations
to descend despite the fact that the morn-
ing air was biting cold this high the
houssa clutched their rifles with sweating
hands as they stared at the sea of vapor
below them it was useless for carter to
explain that the gray vapors opalescent
in the rising sun were not the shades of
dead men but steam rising from small vol-
canic springs in the bottom of the valley

  kaka made their decision for them we
follow bwana juju he told carter to
wrestle with sheitani the devil for the-
soul of the gold haired memsahib he
prayed piously toward mecca but may
allah have mercy on our souls

  the akesi skeleton-limbed thin-faced
human bundles of steel wire said nothing
they knew this valley well before the
coming of the black god the leopard men
had used it often for certain unspeakable
rituals of their owrn more they had
mpembi to avenge

  carter and nylabo leading the safari
began a slow descent wary of posted sen-
tries how many men the black god had
carter had no way of knowing he did
know that he had lost better than thirty
men in the attaack on the big kikuyu vil-
lage there had been thirty men in the
	jungle

 canoe and at least one man in the trees
 the man who had killed mpembi they
 could be all or only a small part of his
 force but there were only so many rogues
 in the congo he did not know now how
 the warriors had been recruited as the
 interpreter at katumbo ismail had access
 to the district police records he had been
 in a position to know the renegades of
 every tribe savage outlaws who had killed
 before and who would kill again for lust
 or for drug-induced dreams or for booty
 the self-styled red-bearded black god had
 offered them all three

   the trail was narrow and tangled with
 vines that clutched at their feet like so
 many green malignant blind snakes as
 his eyes grew accustomed to the mist car-
 ter could see that the vegetation here was
 far more lush than any that he had ever
 seen before this was truely a pre-his-
  toric world bushes grew to tree size
 trees grew into grotesque monstrosities
 that towered into the mist with every
 step he took it became more difficult to
 breath it was like descending into some
 fetid hot house there was a stench of
 rot and damp decay a constant conden-
 sation dripped from the leaves great
 white and purple loathsome orchids clung
 to the bark of the trees like spiders sweat
 started on his forehead as far off he heard
 a distant roaring of some huge beast in
 pain

   tembu ktooma the leader of the
 akesi told him

    he described a large elephant with his
 hands then licked his lips sometimes
 fall in hot spring boil

    carter repressed a shudder with an ef-
 fort he was glad when the trumpeting
 of the dying beast had ceased he could
 not understand how barney sutliff had
 crashed a plane in this white misted green
 hell and lived by questioning ktooma
 he learned that although the leopard men
 had never penetrated the valley that far
 the north end reputedly rose above the
 level of the south and was said to be rock
 floored

   several paces on nylabo stopped
 abruptly stepped to one side of the trail
 and placed a finger on his lips for silence

    carter stared into the mist incredulous
 what appeared to be two animated skele-
 tons their bony hands dangling almost to

stories

their bony knees were climbing the trail
toward them

  the houssa stopped in their tracks their
black skin ashen their breath hissing from
their lips

  no shooting carter whispered and
stand still

  as the two skeletons came closer he
could see that they were men huge ape-
like bakussu their black bodies daubed
with white clay to give them their un-
earthly appearance the red-bearded black
god still playing on the superstitions of
the natives was posting a guard on his
back trail

both savages stunk of palm toddy and
wove slightly from side to side as
they walked not yet fully recovered from
their orgy of the night before when they
saw the frozen houssa both men raised
their assegais and charged with fiendish
glee expecting to plunge their broad blades
in the backs of frightened running men

  the houssa held nylabo and carter
stepped from their places of concealment
clapped their hands over the ape mens
mouths before the baffled killers could turn
and plunged their knives repeatedly into
the bakussus bare chests

  it was over in a moment they died
without an outcry carter felt no re-
morse these men and their kind had kid-
naped ellen he smiled grimly as the
burly-bodied skeleton slid from his knife
there was one distinct advantage in be-
ing a doctor in the congo a doctor knew
how to save lives but he also knew how
to kill his first thrust with the blade
had plunged it into the would-be killers
heart

  when nylabo had dispatched his man
they halted for a brief consultation it
was unlikely that other sentinels had been
posted the black god was too certain of
himself they could push on with greater
speed now every moment might count

  ktooma was certain that if the red-
bearded black gods camp was in the valley
that it would be at the north end where
there were reputed to be rock caves in the
hills and beyond the caves a tunnel that
was said to lead under the hills and con-
nect with the old slave trail that wound
north-east out of the congo across the
wastes of the south sudan
red rogue killer



  carter and nylabo still leading the death
safari moved on again now at a rapid
stride now at a fast dog trot it was as
ktooma had said the heat remained
intense but the lush vegetation fell behind
them to be replaced by a crumbling rock
in which thousands of hot springs bub-
bled here there was no animal life but
a few snakes none of them deadly and
out-sized vanka lizards

  at the end of a half hours trek a gldam
of silver metal shone through the mist it
was barney sutliffs plane both wings
and the tail were crumpled the motor
had wrenched free and bounded a hundred
yards away the door was sprung but the
small cabin was intact

  carter peered into it thoughtfully there
was dried blood on the pilots seat there
was also a gaping hole where the two-way
radio had been

  carter pointed it out to nylabo kaka
and -ktooma he knew the answer to
one of the questions that had puzzled him
he knew now why the red-bearded black
gods voice had so much force and why it
had sounded so metallic he was simply
using a radio amplifier connected to a small
portable battery

  some of his fear left kaka voice come
from box he nodded sagely no god
only allah

  carter took his place at the head of the
safari and motioned it on again he
doubted they had much farther to go the
springs were growing fewer and were more
widely spaced the mist had begui to
thin

  a half mile beyond the plane the rock
plateau began to climb in a rugged series
of slate stairs that some cataclysmic up-
heaval of the earth had formed then the
hot springs and the mist ceased abruptly
across a level floor of stone a sheer face
of rock towered five hundred feet in the
air

  ktooma insisted it is the end of the
valley bwana juju beyond here no men
may go

  nylabo spat disdainfully they had
passed no camp the sentries they had
slain on the trail had come from some-
where there must be some way through
the face of rock

  carters sharp eyes searching the barrier
caught a flash of movement between two

great boulders to their right and set flush
with the cliff

  down take cover behind the rocks
he ordered

  the words had hardly left his lips when
a hideously painted warrior stepped out
from between the boulders as if to see if
the way was clear a moment later a six-
man patrol armed only with long blow
guns trotted out from the cleft in the rock
and headed up the valley at a run their
eyes were clouded with drugs they were
so intent on what they had been sent to
do that they failed to see the men behind
the rocks although one warrior passed so
close to the small boulder behind which
carter was crouched that he could have
reached out and touched him with his hand

  the guard stared after the patrol until
they had disappeared into the mist then
stepped back between the buolders

  carter thought grimly there goes my
execution squad

it was logical to assume that the black
god had reasoned that while his ape
warriors painted to resemble skeletons
might frighten off the akesi and the
houssa that he and nylabo would trek
on alone they would have to work fast
now there would be hell to pay when
the patrol found the two sentries dead

  he motioned the akesi and the houssa
to stay hidden and squirmed across the
open space to the rock behind which ny-
labo had crouched you take charge
he whispered tersely

  nylabo stared at him surprised you
go where bwana juju

  carter explained im going to see if i
cant knock that guard out before he can
raise an alarm i dont know how many
men the black god has but i do know
that were outnumbered our only chance
is to surprise them

  he left the safety of the rock and began
to crawl if another patrol should emerge
if the patrol should chance to turn back
if the guarda should come to the entrance
again-carter hated to think what would
happen thirty feet from the rock he un-
tied his shoes kicked them off got quietly
to his feet and covered the rest of the dis-
tance in a running crouch

  protected by the rock wall he flattened
his back against it until he could get his
	jungle

breath then peered cautiously around one
of the big boulders into the dark of the
tunnel

  the guard was quatted just inside the
entrance he was a savage middle-aged
bakussa with an evil dissipated face as
carter watched him he picked up a joint
of beef and began to gnaw on it hungrily
glancing over his shoulder from time to
time as if expecting his relief

  carter picked up a small pebble and
tossed it out onto the rock plateau across
which he just had crawled the savage
reacted as he expected him to as the
pebble clattered on the rock he dropped
the meat snatched up an assegai and rushed
to the mouth of the tunnel

  carter swung his reversed gun like a
club the blow stunned the barrel-chested
savage briefly but failed to knock him out
a hoarse shout bursting from his throat
he dropped the assegai whipped a knife
from his loin cloth and hurled himself at
carter

  the knife sliced down carters arm slit-
ting his shirt sleeve from his shoulder to
his wrist and drawing a crimson line in
his flesh desperate he attempted to re-
verse his gun and the huge savage knocked
it spinning from his hand

  tabu no more he grunted now
bwana juju die

  his stinking breath was hot and foul in
carters face as the white man fought des-
perately to escape from the powerful arms
that were slowly but certainly crushing
him

  the bakussus flesh was greased beneath
his paint carter twisted and turned and
beat at the leering face now only inches
from his own but he could not break the
hold his breath was coming in painful
gasps death was not far away once
his body went limp the black would break
his spine like a match stick

  carters eyes bulged from their sockets

	pain then the bakussu not he went
limp the black arms fell away from his
sides his already glazing eyes incredu-
lous the savage stepped back staring at
the sharp tip of the assegai blade that was
prortuding from his bowels while the
wood shaft stood out behind him like an
obscene tail

 wah kaka admired that was
truly a mighty throw

stories

  nylabo bounded across the rock to re-
trieve the assegai that he had snatched
from ktoomas sheaf

  carter thank him for his life

  it was nothing the zulu answered
modestly but he was pleased he added
quietly it was perhaps mpembis spirit
who gave strength to my arm

  ktooma nodded gravely as nylabo re-
trieved the assegai and returned it vah
the spear shall stand in a place of honor
when we have returned to the village
carter fingered the long cut on his arm
he was beginning to wonder if they would
return the odds against them were heavy
blood dripping from the long cut in his
arm he strode rapidly down the tunnel
toward the dim light at the far end time
time time they were fighting against
time

the dim light became blazing sun-
shine the tunnel opened into a second
small cup-shaped valley green and fer-
tile and once beautiful but the red-
bearded black god had turned it into a hell
hole and an abattoir the stinking hides
and bloody bones of slaughtered cattle lay
in heaps inside a high stake barricade
a thousand young black men and women
of a dozen different tribes milled and
shrieked and groaned in pain as huge ne-
groes under the direction of ismail fas-
tened rusted fetters and chains around their
necks wearing a snow white burnoose
ismail darted among them driving them
into their places in the slave train with
heavy blows of a kibokos the native whip
made from hippo hide

  great piles of tusks some gleaming
white some green with age dotted the
floor of the valley waiting to be shouldered
by the slaves here and there were smaller
piles covered with matting and guarded
by painted warriors these carter knew
were gold gold washed laboriously from
the rivers of the congo and hoarded in
porcupine quills against a day of famine
when they could be traded to the white
men for life the wealth represented was
tremendous in the short time that he
had been operating at the cost of a few
cheap tricks and by catering to the baser
nature of a hundred renegades who killed
for the love of killing the red-bearded
black god and ismail had stolen enough
red rogue killer	

gold and ivory and slaves to net them
hundreds of thousand of pounds

  with an effort he turned his eyes from
the slave stockade to the hills the green
slopes were dotted with caves ellen was
being held in one of them the question
was which one

  as he stood hesitating a drunken rene-
gade masai obviously the relief that the
dead bakussu had been expecting stag-
gered up the slope toward the mouth of
the tunnel

  carter retreated a few feet into the dark
of the tunnel dont kill him he or-
dered but dont let him cry out

  his eyes blinded briefly by the sudden
transition of light to gloomy half-light the
masai did not see the men at first when
he did and opened his mouth to shout a
warning nylabo pressed an assegai against
his throat so hard that the sharp point
pierced the skin

  cry out and you die he warned him
the man attempted to collect his be-
fuddled wits he glanced fearfully over
his shoulder do i not cry out i die
nylabo shrugged and told him in his
own language the choice is with you
but we have not walked this long way with
death for boori either tell us where the
white memsahib with hair like the midday
sun is being held a captive or- he
pressed his assegai a little harder until a
rivulet of blood ran down the mans painted
chest

  talk carter ordered or so help me
ill stake you on art ant hill where are
they holding the girl 

  the masai wet his lips and pointed to
a cave she and the red-bearded black
god are together bwana  he said pain-
fully but if the bwana should try to
enter the cave he will surely died the
red-bearded black god has said so
carter fingered the butt of his gun ill
chance that

  he considered the location of the cave
to reach it he would have to circle the
valley it would be a simple matter at
night but night was hours away and
every moment counted at any moment
they could expect to hear the excited shouts
of the returning patrol racing back to
camp with news that the sentries were
dead and that the spoor found on the trail
was that of bwana juju if he could res-

cue ellen and get back to the tunnel before
the alarm was sounded even with as few
men as he had they would have an excel-
lent chance of fighting their way back
through the valley of the lost ones to
the upper reaches of the ngesi and the
station

  you come with me nylabo he made
his decision the rest of you stay here
and cover us as best you can if we dont
run into trouble we should be back in half
an hour if we do he shrugged if
we do youll have to fight your own way
back as best you can

  together the two men slipped from the
tunnel into the screening green by the
time they had covered half the distance
to the cave the roaring of orders and the
crack of the whip had stopped from the
fires that had been used to forge fetters
came the savory odor of roasting meat
carter looked at the sun and cursed it
was the hour of the mid-day meal he had
hoped that the confusion below them would
continue

  now crawling across a bare spot on their
bellies now running crouched from tree
to tree they reached a spot fifty feet from
the cave unseen

  nylabo listened intently said sadly the
masai did not lie the memsahib is in
this cave but she weeps bwana she
weeps after the manner of her kind

   carter gritted his teeth if the foul fiends
had harmed ellen-he realized his own
impotence and scowled the odds against
them were even worse than he had fig-
ured if he and nylabo were discovered
before they could return with ellen to the
tunnel the best they could hope for would
be a sudden death it was far more likely
they would be tortured perhaps staked out
on an ant heap as he had threatened the
masai

inch by inch they crawled to the edge
of the screening trees and underbrush
then carter cocked his gun and dashed
across the remaining open space followed
by isiylabo whether they had been seen
from the floor of the valley or not they
had no way of knowing

  ellen had been kneeling beside a cot
her back to the mouth of the cave she
stood up frightened as they entered her
golden hair streaming down around her
	jungle

shoulders and her white cheeks streaked
with tears she took a short step back-
wards staring at carter as though he were
a ghost

  one hand caught at her throat

  youre dead they told me you were
dead

  carter shook her lightly smiled dont
you believe it come on were getting
out of here

  her eyes lighted with hope then grew
dull tears streamed down her cheeks
i cant go i cant she sobbed i cant
leave barney hes sick

  damn barney carter rapped hes
nothing but a- he broke off and whirled
toward the mouth of the cave as a ripple
of shots echoed from the lip of the tunnel
followed a moment later by shrill cries of
rage that swiftly turned into shouts of
alarm the blow gun patrol that had been
sent to kill him had returned

  it was too late to escape quietly now if
they got out at all they would have to
fight their way he swung back and stared
at the figure on the cot the man was
huge and red bearded he was as dark
as his sister was fair and further burned
a deep copper by the sun a dirty blood
stained bandage was wound around his
head his eyes were bright with fever

  okay so they may get us he said
curtly but first ill get the dirty killer
behind this he pressed the muzzle of
his gun to the other mans temple

  no steve please ellen sobbed you
dont understand barney isnt the red-
bearded black god hes just a figurehead
hes been ill out of his head since they
crashed theyve just been using him as
a scape goat the real brain behind all
this-

  carter swung back toward the mouth of
the cave as a man chuckled softly-is the
so-called captain dennis

  behind him ismail leered may allah
have mercy on his soul

  the big florid-faced man eyed carter
with amusement so we meet again the
half-smile faded from his lips bah you
begin to get in my hair so help me for
reasons of my own i did not want to kill
you i wanted you to live but you insist on
dying

  carter saw the whole thing now-too
late he had been stupid the real captain

stories

dennis was dead murdered for his pass-
port and his papers this man was cort
wolf the escaped murderer and bush-
ranger who somehow had wangled barney
sutliff into flying him out of south africa
into the congo he lifted the gun in his
hand until the muzzle leveled on wolfs
heart

  whats to keep me from killing you
wolf

  ellen the other man smiled if i
should die it might prove unpleasant for
her you know ismail slightly i believe
and without my restraining influence he
would undoubtedly sell the girl with the
rest of our merchandise

  carter lowered the gun the thought
of ellen sold as a slave was unspeakable
he started to speak stopped suddenly as
he realized that nylabo was no longer in
the cave

  wolf laughed uproariously at his ex-
pression perhaps you realize by now
that your magic is not as good as it might
be he spat the words scornfully bwana
juju your zulu boy has more sense than
you have when he saw ismail and me
coming he dropped his assegai and scram-
bled up the slope as fast as he could go
his voice grew cold now drop that
gun or so help me well strip and whip
the girl before you

  carter allowed the gun to thud to the
ground so now what happens to me
he asked quietly

  wolf picked up the gun and weighed it
in his palm i have not yet decided he
told him

vii

the hot heavy blackness of the night
pressed against carters eyelids like a
weight there was no sound in the cave
but the hoarse breathing of the dying man
and the soft sobbing of the girl

  wolf had timed his departure well the
slave train loaded with its stolen booty
was moving out when the moon had fully
risen barney sutliff would die before it
left even now his breathing had grown
labored

  carter strained vainly at the baobab
ropes that bound his wrists and ankles it
was useless they were even tighter than
they had been shrunken by the night dew
red rogue killer



grim-eyed he rolled to the mouth of the
cave and stared down into the valley

  it was like looking into some red hell
peopled by shrieking black demons fan-
tastically painted figures leaped and howled
around the fires as they enjoyed to the
utmost the last disgusting debauch in which
wolf was indulging his men from time
to time one of them would stagger into the
stake stockade to reappear with a scream-
ing young female slave who would be
forced to join in the orgy

  across the valley in the lip of the tun-
nel an occasional streak of orange still
lighted the night as the trapped houssa
and akesi fought a losing battle their
attackers could not get at them but neither
could they escape they were trapped
between two fires and doomed to die of
starvation if the blow-guns and hurled as-
segais did not kill them

  carter thought of nylabo and winced
the zulus desertion hurt him after all
that they had been through together it
didnt seem credible

  ellen stopped her soft sobbing asked
what are they going to do with us
steve the girl was unbound but two
evil-faced bakussu stood guard outside of
the cave glancing in from time to time to
make certain that she did not attempt to
release carter

  i dont know carter answered her
truthfully but wolf cant afford to al-
low me to live he knows that ill see
him hanged

he lay reviewing the past few days
sutliff had never been connected with
any of the raids it had been wolf and
ismail from the first they had planned this
thing for months perhaps for years and the
german had not been lying when he had
said that he had wanted carter to live
there had been a good reason for that

  the thing was fiendishly clever wolf
had led the attack on the kikuyu village
and had then had his own men leave him
tied and gagged where carters men would
be certain to find him his plan had been
simple but clever fie had met the real
captain dennis in the jungle and had mur-
dered him but by posing as captain den-
nis he achieved two ends he cleared his
own hands of the murder as captain
dennis he definitely pinned the blame for

everything on sutliff by swearing to car-
ter that with his own eyes he had seen
the famous soldier of fortune leading the
renegade warriors and after the pur-
ported savage fight at the akesi village
during which he and ellen had been kid-
naped carter would be forced to swear
that the renegades had seized him his
death would be regretted as that of a brave
man killed by drug-inflamed savages under
the orders of sutliff

  carter stared through the gloom at sut-
liff he felt sorry for the man how
wolf had induced him to fly him out of the
transvaal and crash in the valley of the
lost ones was something that they prob-
ably would never know it had undoubt-
edly been done at gun point one thing
was certain after pinning his brief but
bloody reign of terror onto barney sut-
liff by building him up in the minds of
the superstitious natives as a self-styled
red-bearded black god cort wolf would
disappear and what the ants had left of
sutliffs body would eventually be iden-
tified by the searching parties who found
it as the body of cort wolf wolf had
admitted as much he had boasted that
he was assuming a new identity under
which he would be enabled to spend his
looted fortune safely

  the scuff of feet outside the cave and
the challenge of the guards brought carter
to a sitting position

  dressed for the long trek to the coast
wolf strode in followed by ismail and an
aged native with a basin of water and a
razor

  his red face was more florid than usual
he had been drinking but he was far from
drunk he had dropped his assumed british
accent and talked in his normal guttural

  and now sutliff becomes wolf he
gloated shave off that beard he or-
dered the native with the razor by the
time that he is found the siafu will have
picked him clean but it is best to leave
nothing to chance

  ellen attempted to go to her brother
and ismail seized her

  carter protested and wolf kicked him
in the stomach

  i am clever nein he demanded
when we move out in a few minutes cort
wolf will be dead and barney sutliff will
be the dead mans body
	jungle

  the thought amused him and he rocked
with laughter

  you beast ellen clawed at the face
of the man who held her and attempted
to squirm free

  gently memsahib ismail gloated his
yellow fingers stroked the white flesh of
her arm i am a great admirer of beauty
and i would not wish to harm anything
so lovely as yourself

  carter strained at the ropes that held
him

  take your hands off ellen

  wolf kicked him again still schwsin
you are not giving the orders here i
am he ordered ismail take the girl
down and put her in a litter i have not
decided yet just what i will do with her
perhaps i will keep her for myself per-
haps we will sell her with our other two
legged cattle she is young and pretty
and full of fire she should bring a fancy
price

ismail ran his tongue across his lips
then shrugged and did as he was told
picking up the girl in his thin but pow-
erful arms he carried her kicking and
screaming from the cave

  wolf laughed heartily she is a tiger
cat nein it will be a pleasure to tame
her

  the veins in carters face and throat
stood out in corded knots as he worked
at the ropes on his wrists in vain

  the german eyed him thoughtfully
and as for you mein jrevmd i should
kill you but i shall deny myself that plea-
sure he looked at the painted bakussu
scowling in the cave and chuckled in-
stead i shall leave you here for my rene-
gades to deal with they should be in a
fine temper for torture when they find i
am not returning from the coast with the
many white mens pleasures that i have
promised them

  carter said nothing there was noth-
ing he could say the bakussu knew only
their own tongue true to form the ger-
man was double-crossing even his own
killers

  the native barber finished shaving sut-
liff and left wolf strode after him to the
mouth of the cave and so good by

  carter shook his head doggedly no
this isnt goodby this is just auf wie-

stories

derselien ill meet you again wolf if

i	have to follow you to hell

  the german laughed heartily at the
thought and left the cave without looking
back one of the guards left with him
the other remained at the mouth of the
cave

  down in the valley the drunken shout-
ing had turned into screams of fear and
pain as the vicious guards whipped the
slave train into line for its long trek to the
coast

  carter lay staring at the rising moon
it was he realized the darkest hour that
he had ever known death did not matter
so much nor did his coming torture
but ellens was one of those screaming
voices he felt that he had failed her

  he tugged and pulled at the rope on
his wrist it held pie had no hope of
freeing himself he would be forced to
lie here in the cave and watch ellen move
out with the slave train without being able
to help her on the cot sutliff began
his death rattle he was well out of it
carter thought

  he lay staring down into the valley be-
tween the legs of the guard whose bulk
loomed large against the newly risen moon
watching the scene below with interest
the bakussu grunted suddenly in annoy-
ance and slapped at his naked ankle then
his big body topped slowly as a tree might
fall for no apparent reason

  a long blow gun in his hand nylabo
materialized out of the night stepped over
the body then paused looking at carter
grinning as the eerie screech of a leopard
echoed through the valley to be answered
in kind from the far side of the cup

  akesi bwana he grinned mpem-
bis soul is making mouti for his children
the leopard men run in the moonlight
and even nylabo respects them for they
are of his blood

  carter rubbed his eyes as a lithe black
figure slipped by the mouth of the cave
he could not tell if it was man or beast
but a moment later the eerie screech
sounded again to be followed by a mans
cry of terror as a leopard man made his
kill

  nylabo cut the ropes from his wrists and
ankles the houssa are still holding the
tunnel bwana he reported but under
the cover of night the akesi have slipped
red rogue killer



into the valley many men will die under
their claws by morning as for myself i
thought it best that one of us be free he
grinned white toothed that is why i
played the coward when you were cap-
tured

  carter stood up stamping his feet and
rubbing at his arms to restore their cir-
culation he was ashamed of his former
suspicions he might have known that
nylabo would not desert him

  well have to work fast the slave
train is moving out and there are only a
handful of us against a hundred

  but moonlight is not daylight bwana 
nylabo answered many of the guards
are drunken then too there are the
slaves

  the slaves struck by a sudden thought
carter plunged out of the cave and stared
down into the valley the scene below
him was one of indescribable confusion
wolf was bellowing hoarse orders men
were attempting to stamp out the fires that
had suddenly transformed them into tar-
gets but they could not stamp out the
moon

  the long unwieldy train of slaves
linked together in groups of twenty moved
a few yards and stopped defying the whips
of their drivers to stare with frightened
eyes into the hills in which the leopards
were screaming

  get them on get them moving 
wolf bellowed

  beyond him in the reflected gleam of
a fire not yet quite stamped out carter
could see ellen her face buried in her
hands seated in a litter carried by four
men ismail was standing beside the litter
her  gibbs in his hands an evil scowl
on his face as he looked up into the hills
for a flash of movement at which to shoot

  on get on you black devils wolf
bellowed

under the lash of the whips and the
prodding of assegais the lumbering
heavy-laden human train moved forward
slowly toward a small cleft in the hills on
the sudan side of the cup carter recog-
nized wolfs strategy it was useless to
attempt to comb the hills in the moonlight
but once the slave train was out of the
valley it would be safe wolf had a hun-
dred warriors against a handful on level

ground the akesi would not stand a
chance

  he plunged on through the underbrush
shouting head them off ktooma
dont allow them to pass through the gap

  the blood curdling screech of a leopard
answered

  ismail fired at the sound of carters
voice and the heavy slug smacked into the
trunk of a tree only inches from his ear
regardless of the noise he made or the
target that he presented he plunged on
down the slope toward the spot where he
had last seen the litter

  as he reached the floor of the valley
he shouted slaves rise up against your
evil masters strike them down with your
chains the red-bearded black god is
dead he can no longer harm you bwana
juju tells you so

  the screaming and moaning of the
chained slaves ceased it was replaced
by a low growing roar there were many
warriors in the train who did not wear
their chins with pride

  he lies wolf shouted desperately em-
phasizing his words with pistol-like cracks
of his whip move on lest the wrath of
the red-bearded black god strike you dead

  ellen cried out from the litter he lies
and not bwana juju rise up slaves the
very bands of iron on your wrists are
weapons

  the slave train swayed undecided car-
ter had almost reached the litter when a
group of twenty slaves broke from their
place in the line and hurled themselves
upon the renegades who a moment before
had been their masters they clawed at
them with their hands and beat at their
evil faces with the heavy irons on their
wrists until nothing was left but bloody
pulp

  another group left the train and still
another and another the tables had sud-
denly turned the slaves had become the
masters some of the renegades fought
plunging their bloody assegais time and
time again into the press of bodies before
they died others fled shrieking into the
hills to be run down by the leopard men
and mangled

  carter plunged on toward ismail the
arab had expended all of the shells in the
gun as carter loomed out of the moon-
light he threw it from him and drew his
	jungle

knife only to have it fall from nerveless
fingers as nylabos assegai pierced his
throat

  carter held ellen briefly youre all
right 

  when she had told him she was un-
harmed he left her in nylabos care while
he fought his way through the surge to
wolf he found him encircled by slaves
who were battering at him with their
chains while he begged hoarsely for mercy
carter started to interfere then turned
back again toward ellen it was kismet
the german was dying as he should die
there were certain natural laws of the
jungle one of them was that all men
born in it were free and wolf had defied
that law it was right that he die under
chains

  by the time that carter had forced his
way back to the litter ellen was standing
beside it her golden hair gleaming in the
moonlight the noise of battle was dying
down and the former moaning of the slaves
had been replaced with a rising triumphant
chant accompanied by the clash of fetters

  here and there in the hills a gun flashed

stories

fire here and there a leopard still
screeched but both ismail and wolf were
dead their power had been broken for-
ever

  carter felt suddenly tired he was sick
of bloodshed and fighting he wanted to
return to his station and his test tubes he
was after all a doctor

  his mission in life was to save life not
to take it

  he stood looking at ellen tongue-tied
wondering how to tell her just how much
he would miss her when she had returned
to the outside world well i guess he
said finally i guess that its all over

  her eyes were shining no she shook
her head its just begun

  carter stared at her puzzled its just
begun i am afraid that i dont under-
stand

  behind him nylabo grinned white-
toothed he understood and bwana
juju would understand all that really
remained to be said was for the maidens
father to make known how many cows he
would take in exchange for his golden
haired daughter
