chapter i

a great wrong

 frank reade was noted the world over as a wonderful and distin-
 guished inventor of marvelous macliines in the line of steam and
 electricity but he bad grown old and nimble to knock about the
 world as he had been wont once to do

 so it happened that his son frank reade jr a handsome and
 talented young man succeeded his father as a great inventor even
 excelling him in variety aud complexity of invention the son
 speedily outstripped his sire

 the great machine shops in reodeslown were enlarged by young
 frank and new dying machines electric wonders and so forth were
 brought into being

 but the elder frank would maintain that inasmuch as electricity
 it the lime was an undeveloped factor his invention of the steam
 man was really the most wonderful of all

  it cannot bo improved upon he declared positively not ir
 steam is used as a motive power

frank jr laughed quietly nnd patted his father on the back

  lad he said with an affectionate though bantering air  what
 would yen think if i should produce a most remarkable improvement
 upon your steam man

  you cant do it declared the senior reade	

 frank jr said no more but smiled in a signi scant manner one
 day later the doors of the secret druughling-room of design were
 lightly locked and young frank came forth only to his meals

 for three months this matter of closed doora continued in the
 machine shop department where the parts of machinery were secretly
 put together the ring of hammers might have been heard and a big
 sign was upon the door

 no admittance

 thus matters were when one evening frank left his arduous duties
 to spend a lew hours with ills wfe and little bov

 but just as he was passing out of the yard adnrky short in stature
 ana of genial features rushed excitedly up to him

 oh marse frank cried the sable servitor jes wait one mo-
 ment

  well pomp said frank pleasantly what can i do for your
 the darky who was a faithful servant of the reades and had ac-
 companied both on their tours in foreign lands ducked bis head with
 a grin and replied

  yo fader wants yo marse frank jes as quick as ebcr yo kin
 come

     my father exclaimed frank quickly  what is it

  i don know nufllu bout it tall marse frank he jes say fo me
 to tell yo he want o to see yo

  where is lie

 in his library sab

  all right pomp tell him i will come at once

 the darky darted away frank saw that the doors to the secret
 rooms were locked this was a wise precaution for hosts of cranks
 and demented inventors were always hovering about the place and
 would quickly have stolen the designs if they could have got at them

 not leu minutes later frank entered the library where his father
 was

the elder reade wps pacing np and down in great excitement

     well my son you have come at last he cried  i have much
 wanted to see you

  i am at your service father replied frank  what is it

  i want you to tell me what kind of a machine you have been get-
 ting up

  come now thats not fair said frank jr with twinkling eyes
  well if its auy kind of a machine that can travel over the prairies
 tell me so cried the elder reade excitedly

 frank jr was at a loss to exactly understand what hi father was
 driving at however he repliod

  well i may safely say that it is now explaio yourself

  i will replied the senior keade ibave a matter of great im-
 portance lo give you frank my boy if your invention is as good o
 my steam man even and does not improve upon it it will yet perform
 the work which i want it lo do

 a light broke across frank jrs face

  ah he cried  i see what you are driving at yon have an
 undertaking for me and my new machine

 frank sr looked steadily at frank jr and replied

  you have hit tbe nail upon the head

  what is it

  first i must tell you a story

  weil

  it would take me some time to go into the details so i will not
 attepipt to do that but give you a simple statement of facts in short
 tbe outline of the story

  all right let as have it

 the seuior reade cleared his throat and continued

  many years ago when i was traveling in australia i waa set upon
 by bushmen and would have been killed but for the sudden arrival
 upon the sjeue of a countryman of mine a man of about my own age
 and ns plucky as a lion

 his name aas jim travers nnd i hod known him in new york
 as the son of a wealthy family he was of a roving temperament how-
 ever and this is whni had brought him to australia

  well travers saved my life he heat oil my assailants and nurs-
 ing my wounds brought me back to life

  i have felt ever since that i owed him a debt which could not be
 fully repaid at that lime  could make no relurn for llio service

 jim nnd i drifted through the gold lields together then i lost
 track of him and until the other day i have not seen or heard from
 him	

  but i now lind that it is in my power to give him assistance in
 fact to partly pay the debt i owe him this brings us to the matter
 in hand

 six months ago it seems that jim who is now a man of great wealth
 slill a bachelor and for a few years past living at a fashionable hotel
 in new york went to his club when he returned iu the evening he
 found a note worded like this

 mr reade laid a noie upon the table frank read it

 oear travers-i would like to see you to-night npon a very
 important matter will you meet me in twenty minutes at the cafe
 on your corner i must see you so be sure and come

a friend

  course jim wondered at the note but he did not know of ao
 enemy in the world so he felt perfectly safe in keeping the appoint-
 ment he started for the cafe

 thenight was dark and misty jim walked along and had got near
 the cafe when somebody stepped out ol a dark hallway and grasped
 his arm

   come in here a sharp voice said we can talk belter here than
 in the cafe

   before jim could make any resistance he was pulled into a dark
 hallway two men had hold of him and something wet was dashed
 across his face and over his hands then he felt some liquid poured
 over his clothes and some object thrust into his pocket

  then the door opened again and he was flung out into the street
 jim was unharmed but amazed at snch treatment he tad not been
 hurt and was at a loss to understand what it all meant

 the incident had taken but a lew moments in its course at lirst
 a thought of foul play had flashed across jim then it occurred to
 him to look at his hands which were wet with some substance

  he gave a great cry ot horror as he did so tbere was blood
 upon them
prank reade jr and his new steam man



    in fact liis hands anil face and clothes were almost soaked in red
 blood for an instant he was horrilied

    what mystery was this bat lie quickly changed his opinion and
 actually laughed

 ii occurred to him as a practical joke upon the part of hid club
 friends satisfied of this he resolved to gel even with them

 he tried to open the door through which he bad been pulled it
 was locked and would not yield

  then he decided to go lack to his room and wash off the blood
 but he had not gone ten slept before ho was met in the glare of the
 lamplight by oue of the club men

 thunder whats the matter with you travers asked bis
 friend

 oh nothing only a liule practical joko the boys have been play-
 ing on me replied jim with a grin two or three others come along
 and jim explains in like manner then he goes to his apartments

  when he arrives there lie is amazed to hud the door open and a
 fearful scene within the furniture the light carpet and the walls in
 places are smeared with blood jim now got angry

      this is carrying a joke a little loo far he cried testily  this
 spoiling line furniture is too much

   but he went to washing the blood from bis hands this was a
 hard job and took lime suddenly half u dozeu officers came into ihe
 room and seized him

   what do you want cried poor jim iu surprise

  we went yon they replied

  what for

  for murder

 instead of being horrifled jim was mad madder than a march hare
 he just got up and swore at the officers

  i dont like ibis sort of tliiug he declared  its carrying a joke
 too far

 the officers only laughed and slipped manacles upon his wrists
 then they led him away to prison not until brought into court did
 poor jim know that he had been made the victim or a hellish scheme

 murder had really beeu committed in that house into which be had
 been dragged and where ho was smeared with blood a man un-
 known was there found literally carved to pieces with a knife

 blood had been found upon jim in his room a trail led from the
 bouse lu his r joir a knife was found in his coat pocket the evi-
 dence was all against him and ids trial had just come oil and lie had
 just been sentenced to death by hanging with only three months of
 grace

 frank reade jr listened lo this thriiling tale with sensations
 which ihe pen cannot depict it was so horrible so strange so
 ghastly that be could hardly believe ii true

 lie arose aud walked once across the floor	

chapter ii

the sew steam man

 then the young inventor paused bofore bis father and in a deeply
 impressed manner snid

 then an innocent man stands convicted of murder

 yes

  in that case it is the duly of every philanthropic man to try and
 save the innocent

 it is

 we must do it

 i am glad to hear you say that

  but the question now arises as to how we bhall be able to do it
 is there no clew to the real assassins

 no definite clew

 that is very si range  course there must have been a motive
 thai motive would seem to be to get travers out of the way

  res

  and he has no enemies

  noue that be knew of

 ah but what would any one gain by putting him out of the
 way--

 frank reade jr paused he gazed steadily at his father much
 passed between lliem in that glance

 his fortune is a large one put in ihe senior reade theright
 to inherit would furnish the besl motive there is but one heir and
 ho is a nephew artemus cliff who ib a stockman somewhere iu llie
 far west it could not bp hlin

 could not frank reade jr sat down and dropped into a
 brown study after a lime he aroued

 i am interested in this casehe declared  and my sleam man
 is at the disposal of justice al any time but you spoke of the prairies
 is there a clew in the west

 the only clew possible lo oblam at present declared mr reade
 sr you see detectives tracked two suspicious men lo kansas
 there they lost track of them everybody believes that they were
 the assassins

 well i believe it cried frank reade jr with impulse lean
 see bul one logical explanation of this mailer either arwmas cliff
 has employed two ruffians to do ihis awful deed for the sake of
 travers money or-the case is one not possible to solve with ease
 frank reade sr did not dislay surprise at this statement of his
 sod

   nowyou have the whole thing in a nutshell my boy he said
  of course you can do ns you please but if you wish to take any
 kind of a journey with your new iuvemion here is a chance and a

 noble object in view that object should be to track drown the mur-
 derers aud clear jim travers it may be that the nephew artemas
 cliff is ihe really guilty one but in any case i believe that it is in
 the west you will find the solution of the mystery

  that is my belief agreed frank reade jr bul now that this
  matter is settled let me show you the plans of my steam man

  frank reade jr drew a roll of papers from his pocket and spread
  them upon the table

 upon them were the blue print plans and drawings of the mechan-
 ism of the sleam man

  frank reade senior examined them carefully and critically from
  one piece to another be wenl aud after some lime drew a deep breaili
  saying

   well young blood is the best after all  must say frank that i
  am beat there is uo doubt but that you have improved upon my
  sleam man i congratulate you

   thank you said frank reade jr with gratification

   but i am anxious to see ibis marvel at work

  you shall replied the young inventor  to-morrow the steam
 mun will go out of the shop upon his trial trip

 a few minutes later frank reade jr was on the way to his own
 bouse

 he was in a particularly happy frame of mind he had achieved
 great results in his new invention and iiere as by design was a
 chance afforded him to use the sleam man to a philanthropic and
 heroic purpose

  the idea of traveling through ihe wilds of the west was a thrilling
  one

  frank could already picture the effect of the steam man upon the
  wild savages of the pluius aud the outlaws of western kansas and
  colorado

  also the level boor-like prairie of that region would afford excellent
  traveling for the new invention

  frank reade jr was a lover of adventure

  it was an inborn love the prospect before him fired bis very sonl
  it was just wbal he desired

  that evening he unlolded all his plans lo bis wife

  of course mrs reade was averse to her husband undertaking such a
  dangerous trip but after a time she overcame her scruples and re-
  conciled herself to it

  the next morning at an early hour frank was at the engine house
  of the steel works the wide doors were thrown open and a wouder-
  ful sight revealed

  there stood the steam man

 	frank reade sr and a great number of friends were present
 pomp the negro wan also there as well as a queer-looking little irish-
 man with a genuine uibernian mug and twinkling eyes which bespoke
 a nature brimming over with fan this was barney oshea

  barney and pomp had long been faithful servants of the reades in
  all of their travels wilh llieir inventions they had accompanied them
  of these two characters we will say no more but permit the reader to
  become acquainted with them in the course of the slory

 the senior reade examined the mechanism of the new steam man
 with deepest interest

 upon my word frank he cried you have bealon me out and
 out i can hardly believe my eyes

  frank reade jr laughed good humoredly

  then lie went about showing a party of friends the mechanlsn of ihe
  new steam man

  the man himself was a structure of iron plates joined in sections
  with rivets hinges or bars as the needs required

 in face and form the machine was a good imitation of a man done
 in steel

  iu no wish did he look ponderous or uuwieldly though his stuture
  was fully nine feet

  the man stood erecc holding the shafts of a wagon nl his hips

 the wagon itself was sight bul roomy with four wheels and a lop
 covering of line steel net work this was impervious to a bullet while
 anyone inside could see quite well all about lliem

  there were loop-holes in this netting to pul the rifle barrels through
  in case of a fight

 a part of the wagon was used as a coal bunker other small com-
 partments held a limited amount of stores ammunitions and weapons

 upon the fender in front was a brake to regulate the wagon on a
 steep grade aud a slit in tlio net work here allowed of llie passage of
 the reins two long lines connecting with the throttle and whistle
 valves a word as to tlio mechanism of the man

  here was really the flue work of ihe invention

 sleam was the motive power

  the hollow legs and arms of the man made the reservoir or boilers
  in the broad chest was the furnace fully two hundred pounds of
  coal could here be placed keeping up a fire sufficient to geierale
  steam for a long lime

 the steam chest was upon the mans back and here were a number
 of valves the tall hat worn by the man formed ihe smoke stack

  the driving rods in sections extended down the mans legs and
  could be set in motion so skillfully that a tremendous stride was at-
  tained and a speed far beyond belief

 this was the new steam man the improvements were many and
 manifest

 all the mechanism was more nicely balanced the parts more
 strongly joined and the steel of finer quality greator speed was the
 certainty
frank reade jr and iiis new steam man

 kire was burning in the furnace steam was hissing from the retort
 and smoke was pouring from the funnel hat of the man

 frank iiende jr suddenly sprang in the wagon
 lie closed the screen door behiud him pomp was engaged in some
 work in the coal bunker

 frank look up the reins and pulled them the throttle was opened
 and also the whistle valve

 three sharp shrieks tbe new steam man gave and then he was away
 on the trial trip

 out of ihe yard he went and out upon the highway

 everybody rushed to the gate and a great cheer went up down
 tbe highway went the steam man at a terrific gale

 ilia strides were lodg and powerful so rapidly were they made
 that a tremendous amount of surface was covered

 it was a good smooth road

 just ahead wa a man riding a horse near him was a bicycler
 who was noted as a fas rider

 both had heard tbal tbe steam man would make bis trial run that
 morning

 bets had been made by both that they could beat tbe man

 frank guessed tbe truth at once

  ki dar marse frank cried pomp with a chuckle and a shake of
 his woolly head  dem two chaps am got a pile ob gall jeayo
 show dem dat dey aint in it wont yot

 pomp had more than one reason for beating the horse and bicycle
 lie had made a small bet of his own on the result

 il was evideut that tbe parties ahead were ready for the fun

 frank reade jr smiled grimly and opened ihe throttle a little
 wider

 the next moment the steam man the bicycle rider and the trotter
 were all hying neck and neck down the road

 heavens what a race that waa

 down the road they flow like a whirlwind the dust flew up behind
 them in a cloud

 but ihe steam man just trotted by his competitors with seemingly
 no exertion at all frank turned with a laugh lo see how easily they
 were distanced

 afier a good trial tbo new stenm man returned to the foundry yard
 as frank stepped down out of the wagou bis father came up and
 grasped his hand in an ecstasy of delight

  liruvo my son ho cried  yon have eclipsed my invention i
 wish you luck and i know lhat you will succeed in clearing jim tra-
 vers

  i shall lake only barney and pomp with me- said frank reade
 jr  there will not be room in the wagon for more

  well they will be useful companions said the senior reade
  my bon may god be with you in your enterprise

 frank heade jr at once proceeded to make preparations for his
 western trip
 lie visited travers in prison nnd talked with him

 to tell the truth i am distrustful of my nephew artemas clilt
 he is an nricious villain nnd a number of times has tried lo swindle
 me out of money i know lhat he has led the life of an outlaw out
 there on the border

  but if bo aspired to gain your wealth why did he not attempt
 your life in some direct manner asked frank

 t presume be may have feared detection replied travers  if i
 am hong for the murder of this unknown man the mystery will be
 sealed forever tlioy real murderer will never he known

 i believe you are right agreed frank reade jr well i will
 flml this artemas cliir and do the best i can towards clearing up the
 mystery and selling yon right

 thank yon said travers with emotion i feel that you will
 succeed

chapter iii

ox the plains

 tnb scene of oar story now undergoes a great change

  wu will transfer the reader from readestown to the plains of the
 far west fully live hundred miles from civilization and right in the
 heart of the region of the hostile sioux

 frnnk reade jr had transported the steam man as far as possible
 by rail

from thence he had journeyed the rest of ihe ways overland

 nothing of thrilling sort had as yet marked their journey but they
 were upon the verge of the most exciting adventures as the reader
 wlll jiereafter agree possible  lie experienced by man

 with the broad expanse of rolling plain upon every band one morn-
 ing in june ihe steam man might imvo been seen making its way
 along ai a moderate gait

frank reads jr with barney and pomp were in the wagon

 -rank held the reins and hia keen gaze swept ihe prairie in every
 direction	j

 as far as the oye could reach there remained tbo same broad ex-
 panse there was little to break the monotony

 barney nnd pomp had taken advantage of a lull in their duties to
 play a social game of poker in the rear of the wagon

 these two unique characters although the warmest of friends were
 nevertheless always engaged in badgering each other or the perpetra-
 tion of practical jokes

  bejabers ill go yez ten hetther on that yez black ape cried
 barney throwing down a handful of chips   take me worrnd its
  nig blult yez are playin yez cant fool me

  youse will jest find out dis nigger neber plays a bluff gamsre-
 torted poinp with a chuckle  jest yo look out to yosef i ish
 begorra i aint afraid av yez an ill go ye the tin cried barney

 there was a broad grin upon pomps face he quietly picked up
 ten chips and then put in ten more

  hold on iist ill so youse ten better

 call yez be hivens cried barney chucking in ten more

 then he threw down bis hand

  can yez bate that he cried triumphantly  give us the pot
 naygur yez are no good

 but pomp put one black paw over ihe pile of chips

  jes wait one mlnnit iish

  wbarro yez cant bate it cried barney confidently

 he had thrown a good hand containing four kings and two ace
 but pomp quietly laid down four aces

 the picture was one well worthy of an artist for a moment the
 two card players gazed at the six aces in amazement it was a very
 corious anomaly that there should he six aces in one pack of cards

 then barney sprang up furiously

  begorra its a big cheat ye are be cried angr ily  whoever
 saw the loikes av that be me sowl ihe hull pile is mine

  don yo put yo hands on dem chips iish  cried pomp angrily

  praps yo kiu tell me whorfore youse got dem two aces maybe
 youse can

 bejabers they war in the pack but yez kin tell me perhaps where
 yez got those four aces yez put down ihere-

  i tell yo iiali dey wns in de pack

 bejabers its the fust pack av cards i ever saw with six aces in
 it retorted barney

  now don yo gib me any mo ob yo sasa iish blustered pomp
 ill jes make yo sorry if yo does

  bejabera yez aint the size

  look out fo yoself iiab

  whurroo

 over went the table leaf down went the chips in the bottom of-
 the wagon and the two angry poker players closed in a lively wrestle

 for a moment barney hail tbe best of it then pomp tripped the
 celt op and both fell in a heap in the bottom of the wagon

 they chanced to fall against the wire screen door in the rear of tbe
 wagon

 it was unlocked and gave way beneath the pressure and the two
 practical jokers went through it and out upon the hard lloor of the
 prarie

 they were rolled about in a cloud of dust and had they not been of
 something more than ordinary composition they would have suflered
 fronrbroken bones

 but as it waa both picked themselves up unhart

 the steam man bad gone ou fully one hundred yards before frank
 reade jr perceived that hia companions were missing and at oucs
 closed the trottle and brought the man to a holt

 serves tbe rascals right muttered frank as he saw them pick
 themselves up from ibe dubt they are always skylarking and no
 good comes of it

 frank bad stopped the steam man he waited for tho two jokers
 to pick themaelves up and return to the wagon

 but at tlmt moment a thrilling thing occurred

 barney and pomp hnd fallen near a clnmp of timber

 from this with wild yells a band of mounted sioux indians now
 dashed

 they were a war parly-pointed and bedecked with feathers and in
 the full paraphernalia of war

 the peril which threatened the two jokers was one not to be de-
 spised

 il was quite evident that the savages meant to cut off their rejoin-
 ing the steam man in that cose their fate would be sealed

 but barney was quick-witted and saw ihe situation at a lance

 with a wild howl he broke into a mad ran for the steam man it
 was a question of life or death and he ran as ho had never ran before

 pomp wns not so lucky while barney waa distancing hia pursuers
 nnd actually succeeded in reaching the wagon the darky suddenly
 found himself cut off

 indian ponies were circling abont him the red riders whooping and
 yelling like veritable demons

 the poor darkj waa beside lilmslf with terror and perplexity

 gollv sakes alibe lie yelled with his wool literally standing on
 end  whatebber am dia yer nigger gwine fo to do ise a gone coon
 fo suah

 it certainly looked that way the savages circled nearer and half a
 dozen of them dismounted and rushed upon pomp

 now the dnrky was unarmed

 he had not even a pistol or a knife of course lie waa at their mercy

 in less time tlmn it takes to tell it the aavnges had closed in about
 the terrified darky and he waa quickly thrown upon his back and
 bound

 then he wns laid across the back of a pony nnd tied on securely

 then a inriat waa attached to the ponys bridle and the savages
 with their prisoner in their midst dashed away

 barney had reached the steam man and climbed into the wagon

 frank reade jr hnd seen the whole affair and for a momeut was
 too astounded to act

 then as barny came tumbling into the wagon frank turned the
 man around and sent him hying ioward tiie savages

 this move was quickly made and the steam man ran forwail
frank reade jr and his new steam man



 rapidly but quick as it had been the savages had yet succeoded in
 making pomp a prisoner and gotling away with him

  bejabers theyve got ihe naygur bound  a horse cried barney
 wildly  wud yez luk at the loikes mislher frank we must catch
 the umadhounb and give them a lessin of the right sort

  hope we muy replied frank with great anxiety  but i fear
 the red uends will gel to cover bofore we can overtake them

 whurroo its mesilf as will splioil the loike av some av thim
 cried barney as ho picked up his rifle

 the savages were racing like mad across the prairie

 they had caught sight of the sleam man which was to ihem some
 fiend incarnate some evil spirit which would seek their certain de-
 struction

 terror of the wildest sort made them whip their ponies io the ut-
 most

 it was a mad race

 but the steam man was gaming

 he took tremendous strides frank pulled the whistle valve and
 the elirieka sent up on the air wore of a terrifying kind

 the savages had all gazed with wonder upon the white mans iron
 horse that followed us sleol track across their prairies

 lint this latest appearance the steam man was too much for their
 nerves they could not bear it and fled

 the steam man wonld certainly have overtaken them

 but not visible until one had turned the timber line and made a
 rise in the prairie was a distant range of hills

 toward tins the savages were going if they reached them they
 would certainly succeed in eluding their pursuer

 and the chances seemed good

 frank saw with a peculiar chill that they were really liable to
 reach the point aimed at

 lie sent the man oil at full speed

 barney placed himself at a loophole and commenced qring as rap-
 idly as he could at the fleeing foe

 the result was that many of them fall and the others redoubled
 their exertions to make an escape

 ou went the chase toward the distant range of hills

 nearer and nearer drew the ponies to the objective point

 with sinking heart frank eaw that the indians were likely to reach
 them before the steam man could overtake them

 of course this would mean safety for the savages for the steam man
 coiui not hope to follow the ponies over the rough surfaces there en-
 countered

  heavens we are not going to save iomp cried frank with a
 thrill of despair in his voice  what shall we do barney is it not

 awful

 barney was busily engaged in placing fresh cartridges in his win-
 chester

  begorra its save the nnvgiir  will if i sacrifice me own loife
 cried the big-hearted celt  its me own fault for sure that he iver
 jell troo the door and got picked up bv the red niin

 frank put on all the steam lie dared and the inau took tremendous
 strides forward

  we wiii make a mighty effort he gritted as lie piled on the
 sleam

  bejabers here goes for wan av the spalpeens cried barney

 then the irishmans rifle cracked

 one of the savages tumbled from his ponys back

 barney continued lo load and lire as fast as he could but the op-
 portunity was not long granted him

 suddenly the cavalcade of savages dashed into the moulh of the
 pass

 they were out of sight in a twinkling the steam man was obliged
 to come to a halt

 there were huge howlder and piles of stones to block the passage
 barney and frank ueade jr exchanged dances of despair

 that is the end of pomp declared the voung inventor with a
 chill  i have no doubt that is a part of black buffalos hand and
 he never spares a life

chapter iv

the cowboys

 frank had spoken truthfully the band of savages was really a
 part of the tribe of which black buffalo was the chief

 throughout all the kansas border this blood thirsty llend was
 known and feared

 he had ravaged more wagon trains burned more settlements and
 committed more massacres than any oiher sioux chief in the far
 west

 his name was a synonym of ierror among the settlers from da-
 kota to the boundary line of texas

 by many he was claimed to be a white man or renegade others
 averred that he was a recreant pawnee chief

 however this was certainly no red warrior was better known and
 feared than black buffalo

 and it was into his bands that pomp had fallen

 small wonder then that frank reade jr was much alarmed and
 even inclined to believe his faithful servitors life lost

 the merciless black buffalo would not be likely to spare pomps
 life the savages had captured him alive simply to drag him into the
 hills and lurturo him to death

 barney began to bemoan the situation in violent terms

 ocb hone the poor soul he cried he was a black naygnr hut

 he had a white heart jiat that eame be jabers av we cud only get
 near enough lo the red omadhouns id loike lo shoot ivery mothers
 son av thim

  well i dont see why the red bends baventulie best of as de-
 clared frank

  it iuks lhat same mulher frank wailed barney

  i dont see how we cun ever get through that pass the sleam-
 man might go there but the wagon wont

 this was true enough

 the steam man on the level prairie was invincible but on rough
 ground like this wholly useless

 frank and barney were beside themselves with solicitude and per-
 plexity

 frank even thought of going forth on foot to try and overtake the
 redskins but of course the folly of such a course was quickly ap-
 parent to him

 barney even attempted to carry out literally this plan

 he went so far as to open the door in the wire screen and leap
 down to the ground

 but frank cried sternly

  barneyi come back at once you can gain nothing by such a
 course

 shure mr frank cried the irishman if yez will only let me
 go-

 come back was franks terse command which was reluctantly
 obeyed by ihe celt

 frank took a careful look al the hills

 he chanced to see a smooth pathway up ihe height and which
 seemed to follow the course of the canyon or pass

 up tills the steam man cautiously advanced as they continued lo
 ascend higher a good broad view of the prairie was obtained

 and suddenly reaching an elevation from which a southward view
 could be obtained frank gave a sharp cry and taking a glass from a
 locker sprung lo a loop-hole in the netting

 he scanned a number of objects upon the prairie far beyond

 at that distance they looked like a herd of buffaloes

 but with the glass frank saw that they were mounted men and
 white men at that

 they looked like a roving band of cowboys in any event they were
 while men and it was quite enough for tho young inventor to know
 this

  we can depend upon ihem to help rescue pomp cried frank
 exuberantly luck is yei with us barney

 be jabers i hope so cried the excited celt if they bo while
 men and have a heart theyll shurely do it

 frank instanliy turned the wagon about and sent the steam man
 rapidly down to the prairie

 lie blew shrill blasts upon the whistle to attract the attention of the
 white men

 in ibis he was successful

 as the steam man reached the prairie floor the cavalcade of cow
 boys came dashing up

 they did not seem surprised at sisht of the sleam man somewhat
 sfngularly and drew up hfty yards distant while one of tteir uumber
 rode forward

 ho was evidently the leader and wa a tall dark evil-lookiii fel-
 low frank reade jr was not favorably improssed with ins appear-
 ance

 as the young inventor noted that the whole gang had a forbidding
 appearance and with a chill frank realized lhai he could hardly ex-
 pect any assistance from such a cut-lhroat looking hand

 the tall dark leader dolled his sombrero as he rode forward and
 made a low bow

  buenos senors he said with a spanish accent  i wish you a
 fair day do you travel far with your iron mau

 i am glad lo meet you replied frank eagerly we come
 from the east and we are here upon an important mission

 the stranger smiled and bowed again wilh a peculiar affectation ol
 politeness

  i um pleased to hear it are you not the gentleman called
 frank reade jr

 frank gave a start of surprise

  i am he replied quickly  then you have heard of me

  i have senor reade replied the cowboy chief with another ex-
 aggerated bow and smile

  perhaps you know of my mission here

  i do was the reply

 frank was more amazed than words can express what mystery
 was this

 how had this fellow who bore the stamp of a spaniard learned of
 his mission to the far west the young inventor was staggered for
 a moment

  your mission here replied the cowboy chief politely  s to hunt
 down two men who you believe are guilty of a murder wi ich they
 skillfully foisted upon a certain man by the name of jim travers

  you are right cried frank  but how in the name of wonder
 did you know lhat

 i prefer not to say it is enough that i know it

  it is strange that you bhould have learned it said frank  but

 i	will ask no more questions just now in the face of a terrible ex-
 igency

 all

 i want to ask your help

 my help
frank reade jr and his new steam max

 tim miraiipra were now the pursued

  pardon senor but i cannot see in what manner i can serve you
  you must assist me one of my men-a colored man-has fallen
 into tie hands of the indians they have made him prisoner and
 bave just escaped with him into lliese lulls  ask your assistance in
 effecting his rescue

  a peculiar smile played about the cowboys lips

   is he not llis one you call pomp lie asked

  	 ypf

   and that man with yoa in your cage there is called barney

   yes

 ah i see-barney and pomp well senor reade pray accept
 my compliments and llie wish that you may see clvilzation again alive
 winch i  not belive will be tho case a-ha-hal you bave blun-
 dered into a dealh-lrapl

 something like a correct comprehension of ailairs now began to
 dawn upon frank

  what do yon mean he gasped in surprise  who are you

   well since you ask mo i will tell you replied ihe cowboy chief
  with a laugh  i am no spaniard as you might have thought i
  am ns good an american as you and you will have good cause lo it
  member my name in the near future provided you escape from this
  trap i am the man you are so eagerly looking for-i am artemas
  cliff

  heavens gasped frank reade jr  the man i am looking
 for

 the same replied  mockingly  you have undertaken
 quite a daring deed my line inventor but you will find that you have
 bitten off a very much larger slice than you can masticate

   we will see began frank

  you see these men continued clift  they are my followers
 tried and true what is it to you whether my uncle jim travis
 should hang for murder you can never prove him innoceut-at
 least never will for you will never go from here alive

   scoundrel cried frank  you are the real murderer

   a ha ha provo it if you can laughed the cowboy chief de-
  risively

  i	will prove it if i have to drag the confession from your lips
  cried frank resolutely

 pshaw talk is cheap attention men grab the throttle rein
 of the steam man and you can destroy him forward charge
 frank rfado jr heard the command aud know well the danger
 lie was at a loss to account for cliffs knowledge of him and his inven-
 tion

  tiip young inventor was nol aware of the fact that for weeks pre-
  ious to the starling forth of the steam man spies had been busy in
  rctulislown

  but such was the truth

 artemas clill had covered liis tracks well he knew that frank
 reade ihe young inventors father was a friend of travers and would
 see him through if possible

  therefore he had provided well for giving frank reade jr and ihe
  now steam man  hoi reception on theplains

 willi hoarse cries llie cowboys descended upon the steam man
 they urged their horses forward at a full gallop

  frank reade jr knew well that it was possible for them to greatly
  injure his invention so he made quick action lo defeat llieir plans

  me bliouted to barney

   give it to them barney shoot every man you can

  then frank opened the throttle and let ihe steam man out for nil
  lie was worlli

 ii was an easy matter to outstrip the horses and the steam man
 kept ahead while the cowboys came thundering on in the rear

 then frank slackcnod speed so as to keep up a uniform distance
 between the man and the horses

  while harney poured in shot after shot into the midst of the gan
  of pursuers

 the cowboys began to drop from their saddles one by one it was
 a destructive and telling lire

 and they strained every nerve in vain in an effort to reach the
 team man frank kepi the mail just far enough ahead to ensure
 safety and enable barney to pick off the cowboys with ease

  it look cliff some lime lo tumble lo this little game

 when be did and realized that he was simply decimating numbers
 wit boat gaining ground he called a bait

 the cowboys were now near the tanks of a wide river which was
 f  lh l frank reade jr saw ins advantage and brought
 be steam man lo a stop then he seized a rifle and joined barney

                  chapter v
                  pomps rescue

  bi t it was hardly likely that the cowboys would stand their ground
  long under such a lire	

 a fast as they could frank and barney worked the repeaters
 prairie at quile a nunber of the foe lay dead upon the

knw the fatality of remaining there being tin-

 ueuu	man	lheir j hp now was in re-

 tofisjissfos s

  i-	rank at once sprang lo the reins and the brake and started the
  im man in pursuit it was quite a turning of tables

 so it continued until suddenly by the orders of cliff the cowboys
 tamed tbeir horses into the river and forded it	

 once on tlio oilier side they were soon beyond the reach of ihe rifle
 balls the steam man of course could not follow

 the encounter with the cowboys was at an end

 they did not return lo the attack somewhat singularly bul kept
 on until ihe rolling plains hid them from view

 cllfls direful threat against the steam man and its inventor had
 not been carried out but frank did nol by any means delude him-
 self with tbe belief that the villain would relinquish tlio attempt so
 easily

 well barney he cried cheerily when satisfied that the scrim-
 mage was over  we came oul of that scrape a little the best of it

 ii	lns all turned out as i expected that cliff is the real murderer
 begorra it luks that way mistber frank agreed barney

  so it does we must plan to capture the villain and wring a
 confession from him

 be jabere thats thrue il l only bad an opportunity id pretty
 quick wring his loon uck for him

 but that does not settle the question of pomps fate declared
 frank  lie must be saved

 sbure misther frank

 bul how car we do it

 this was yet a conundrum

 frank and the faithful irishman stood looking at each olher it
 was a long time before either spoke

 finally frank said

 theres only one way barney

  an phwats that

 weve got to get into those hills in some way i dont like to

 leave the steam man but to save pomp id--

 tlio young inventor ceased speaklug a slradge medley of sounds
 caire from the direction of the pas

 tere were wild yells and pisiol shots and then out upon llie prai-
 rie the two astonished travelers saw u motley crew of horses aud sav-
 ages emerge

 the savages were fighting furiously frank knew enough of the
 indians of that region to know what il all meant

 a band of sioux and a band of pawnees the deadliest of enemies
 were eugaged in a terrilic battle

 frank took in the scene at a glance

 he at once understood all

 the band which had captured pomp was undoubtedly the one en-
 gaged in ihis coullict they bad very likely met the pawnees in llie
 upper part of the pass

 when ihe pawnees and sioux met a fight always followed gen-
 erally the latter came off victorious

 as il seemed now however the pawnees had tbe best of it

 they were worsting the sioux fn good fashion frank and barney
 watched the sceue a moment until suddenly a sharp cry burst from
 barney

 begorra misther frank if there aint the naygur lie cried
 wildly

 barney was right frank glanced in the direction indicated and
 saw a thrilling act

 in the midst of the sioux was pomp bound to the back of a mus-
 tong

 suddenly in the midst of the meleo the horse was seen to bolt from
 the rest ami dash out upon the prairie

 of course pomp had no control over the benst having his hands
 tied behind him

 the mustang took his own course and ran like the wind

 the sioux did not dare lo any of them attempt pursuit the foe iu
 their front claimed their attention

  bejabers the horse is runnin away wld the naygur cried bar-
 ney  pliwat will we do mislher frank

 catch him if we can cried frank seizing the throttle rein

 he opened ihe throttle and let the steam man go ahead with long
 strides the machine began to gum upon the mustang

 pomp wan vainly endeavoring to frea his banns

 if be could bave done so and could have got bold of the reins once
 he could easily have stopped tbe horse

 but this he was unable lo do

 as a result the animal carried him along swiftly and along the
 base of llio hills

 suddenly the mustang swerved and darted into a narrow pass

 barney at the loop-holes of the wagon with ride in hand had been
 sorely tempted lo lire at the runaway

 but the fear of hitting pomp bad restrained him

 now however the horse was out of range but frank headed the
 steam man for the pass

 fortunately it was unobstructed by bowlders and had a good level
 floor the steam man was enabled to forge along with safety

 but the mustang and bis black rider had gone irom sight how-
 ever the pursuers kept on

 suddenly they came out upon a broad plateau with steep descent
 npon all oilier sides this extended among tbe hills for a distance of
 several miles

 a great cry of horror now went up from frank nnd barney

 the musinng was seen racing along the edge of a irighly chasm
 in a tew seconds he would be almost sure to take an impossible leap
 over a deep gorge
frank reade jr and his new steam man



 if lie should go to the bottom of that gorge it would be the end o
 pomp und the mustang

 this was seen at a glauce and with the most intense of horror bar-
 ney cried

 shall  tire mistlier frank its the only tiling as will save the
 naygur

  you will have to do that replied frank sharply  look out
 for your aim harney god help pomp

 baruey pulled lliu trigger

 crock

 the bullet sped true to its mark it struck the mustang in the
 side

 the amlnal faltered throw up its head stumbled and tlieu pitched
 forward in a heap

 pomp lay beneath hie horse it did not require but a few moments
 for the steam man to reach him however

 iu a twinkling baruey sprang out of the wagon and cut pomps
 bonds

 the darky was not in the least injured he lay with one leg under
 the mustang but was easily extricated

 the joy of the darky at iiis rescue cauiiot be expressed iu words

 he embraced barney ellasively

 sliure  thought yez kilt inioirely naygur cried the big-hearted
 irishman  its moightyglad i am to see yez aloive

  yo kin jest bet dis chile am glad fo lo get out ob dem red debhils
 hands cried pomp exuberantly

 and then he dashed aboard the steam man and grasped franks
 hand

 oh marse frank ise dretful glad to see yo cried pomp ex-
 citedly

 	am glad to imve you back pomp cried frank  and to know
 that you are nnbarmed in any way but it was a close shave for you
 deed it was dat marse frank but dis nigger am powerlul hard
 for to kill an specs dals why  lib but ise got lois to tell you
 marse frank

  you have exclaimed frank

  deed i has praps yo kin find it valuable fo yo ill jes tell
 yo dat when we went up troo dat pass we jes cum out pretty quick
 in a valley dat ar valley was a scrumptious one an dar was a trail
 leadin down inter it but afore the injuns could ride down inter it
 along cum six white men on hossback an a right pert young lady on
 a hoss too

  sake alibe i neblior seen so pretty a gal in all mail lire well
 dese yer men dey seemed like dey was qnainted wid der injuns dey
 jes talked as freelike wid old black buffalo an i jes opened my oars
 an listeued

  bey said dat de gal was a prisoner an dey was takin ber from a
 cave in lie hills to ranch v dey mentioned de jname ob arteinas
 cliff den dey rode on sah an mah sakes jus den up from the val-
 ley dere came a hull gang ob itjgines and pitched into us ob cose
 yo know all de res

 frank reade jr listened with the deepest amazement to this ex-
 citing story

  a young girl lie gasped  of course those men were cliffs
 but where on earth were they going

  dey done said it was to ranch v sah

 ranch v repeated frank that is not very definite bui it
 must be the headquarters of cliff and his gantr you didnt hear them
 say just where that ranch was located pomp

 no sah bin  jes took note ob de dircckshun dey was goio anil
 was to de bouf-west

 well said the young inventor as he turned the sleam man
 about  i cannot imagine who the young girl is or how she fell into
 the bands of cliffs ganj but it is certain that she is in their power
 and we must save ber

 bejabers thats roight mistlier frank cried barney gallantly
 the osheas from brian born down war always kiiown as men av
 honor an defenders av female virtue

 tlio steam mail started on the return across tlie plateau

 it was frank reade jrs intention to reach the prairie once more
 and strike out to the southwest in the hopes of locating the ranch v

 the steam man ran swiftly to the mouth of the pass which led down
 to the prairie

 barnoy had filled the furnace with fresh coal and the indicator
 showed that there was plenty of waier in the boiler

 frank was about lo enter the pass when suddenly pomp sprang up
 with a wild cry

 the darky sprang to franks side and tried to grab the throttle rein
 frank was astounded

  hold on there pomp what are you trying to do lie cried

 ki dar marse frank stop de man or fo de lawd we am all
 done fo suah as preachin

  what gasped frank

 if yo dont believe it jes look np yonder

 pomp pointed one linger upward to the canyon wall above the pass
 the sight which rewarded the startled gaze of the young inventor
 caused him to reverse the throttle and bring the steam man to a halt

 two cowboys were crouching behind an enormous bowlder which
 they had intended to roll down upon the steam man

chapter vi

the fight in the pass

 a more narrow escape could hardly be imagined

 the precipitation of the huge bowlder upon the steam maa would
 have destroyed the invention aud ihe lives of those on hoard

 just in lime pomp had seen the danger auotber moment and it
 would have been too late

  ki yi don yo see now marse frank cried poinp wildly

  i see replied frank in thrilled tones  my god that is a nar-
 row shave we would hare beeu crushed to atoms iu another moment
 as i live

  whurroo give the spalpeens a good bit av cold lead sliouted
 barney rushing to one of the loopholes-wilh his rifle

  thats right cried frank doing the same

 golly yo kin bet we will do dat chimed in pomp

 the two cowboys seeing hint their game was exposed sprang up
 with wild shouts of dismay

 as they did so they were exposed to shots from below the three
 rllles spoke sharply in chorus

 the two would-be destroyers tumbled in a heap their fall was fol-
 lowed by a wild chorus of yells from ihe thickets and bowlder piles
 above

 a volley of bullets came from there and rattled harmlessly against
 the steel netting showing lhat the cowboys were there located in
 great force

 iiow they had chanced to be ibere at that critical moment our ad-
 venturers could only guess

 but frank mentally concluded that at best they were but a division
 of clilla gang and they had happened upon the spot by chance

 seeing the steam man they had seized what seemed lo them a hne
 opportunity to destroy it

 how far short they came of it we have already seen

 a red-hot contest now began between the cowboys and those in the
 steel wagon

 of course our three friends had a vast advantage inasmuch as they
 were protected from the shots of their foes

 of course the outlaws far outnumbered them but it was not at all
 a difficult matter to pick them oil occasionally wilh a rille bullet

 volley after volley the cowboys fired at the sleam man

 when at length it became patent to them lhat their shots were fu-
 tile they made the air ring with yells of baffled rage

 then they ceased firing and silence ensued every cowboy had
 disappeared seemingly from the canyon wall

 but this diu not deceive frank reade jr

 ue knew that this was only a game of the foe and that it would yet
 be unsafe to try the pass

  bejabers aint there some other way av gettln out av this place
 cried barney glviug the plateau u sweeping glance

 but ihe chain of hills surroundiug it did not lend color lo such a
 possibility

  it dont look like it said frank dubiously

   je fink dat am de only way out ob dis plnce said pomp

  we are in a kind of irnp declared frank reade jr  wo
 were not sharp or we would have-avoided this scrape

 as it was however the best they could do was to watch for au op-
 portunity to run the gauntlet through the pass

 but they had not long to wait for new and thrilling developments
 suddenly pomp gave a startled cry

  for massy sakes marse frank jes yo look out yonder what
 ebher am dey up lo now

 over the edge of the plateau there was visible a line of men advanc-
 ing rapidly toward the sleam man

 they were deploying right aud left as if to surround him this was
 certainly their purpose

  theyre lliryin lo surround us cried barney

 frank watched the maneuver with deep intrrest

 he smiled grimly

 this was certainly the purpose of the foe but the young inventr
 saw in the move a betterment of his own chances

  they will not gain whal they hope lo he said resolutely

 then he saw that a line of armed men had deployed across tlio
 mouth of the pass lo prevent the steam man from escaping in that
 direction

 in franks judgment there were fully two hundred cowboys in the
 party this was tremendous odds but the young inventor did not
 fear the results

 with a wild cheer the cowboys began to close their line in about
 the siearn man

 frank reade jr opened the whistle valve and let out several de-
 fiant shrieks

 then he started the steam man in a straight line for the pass

 pomp and barney with their repeaters began to are upon the line of
 men there

 the repeaters did deadly work

 it was a constant fusillade and the cowboys dropped like sheep
 the error of their plan could now be seen

 in dividing their force lo make the surrounding line they had
 weakened theinselve frank had seen this

 if they had been merely content wilh holding the pass it would
 have been exlremely doubtful if the steam man could so easily have
 escaped

 just as fast as they could work the slxeen-shot winchesters bar-
 ney and poinp mowed down the opposing line of cowboys

 the line was thin and it would have required a very solid corps to
 have wilhstood that scathing lire

 down went the steam mah toward the pass with fearful speed

 heaps of the dead and wounded cowboys lay upon the ground as


frank reade jr and his new steam man

 tho sleani man reached tho pass a number of the cowboys tried to
 i-rasp the lliroille reins and stop ihe machine

 liui the ponderous body of the man kuocked them aside like hies
 and the wheels ol tbe heavy wagon crushed them into death or insen-

 the steam man literally forged his way through the pass like a

 riurney and pomp cheered wildly and lired parting shots at the dis-
 comfited foe

 in a few momeuts the sleain man ran out upon theprairie

 frauk did not waste tune but set big course ut once to tbe south-

 	he was anxious to locale ranch v this he believed was his first
 and most important duty

 tie was satisfied that nothing was to be gained by remaining in the

  llo was confident hint chit had gone to ihe ranch v wherever it
 was more tlmn all else he was powerfully interested in tbe mys-
 terious young lady os described by pomp

 lie was determined to know who she was and what cliff held her in
 captivity lor

 the day was rapidly drawing to a close

 after a short while the hills faded out of sight and the rolling
 prairie was visible opon every hand

 then as the steam mau took ids long strides across the even plain
 frank suddenly caught sight of a beaten path or trail

 it was plainly a trail much used and bore a irifle east of south
 frank brought ihe man to a stop

   would like to know where lhat trail goes to he declared 
 am not sure hut it is the route to ranch v-

 golly marpe frank cried pomp craning his neck and looking
 to the southward a little ways  what am dat jus obnr dat roll in
 de peroiry am not dal some berry sumspicious objec

 frank gazed in the direction indicated aud saw a tall black-looking
 timber seeming lo rise out of the roll in ihe prairie but he knew
 that it was beyond

 frank let the steam man go along for a quarter of a mile and top-
 ping the rise a starillng eight was revealed

 there scattered over several acres of land were-the blackened ruins
 and charred llmbara of some buildings

 it was easy lo see what these buildings lmil constituted

 a large ranch with stockade extensive cattle pens and yards hnd
 oncu nood upon this spot frank allowed ths steam man to pass
 through die ruins

 tholiing sights were accorded our adventurers

 there were heaps o ashes the bones of animals and several
 charred skeletons of human beings

 there was every evidence lhat a fight had occurred at the place and
 linn the ranch hall been burned by either indians or rival cowboys

 ah chance imd il the sign which painted in broad letters had once
 lmr over the yard gate had not been destroyed aud lay upou the
 ground nenr

 our explorers were enabled to read it plainly

  hodman ranch

 harney and pomp descended from from the wagon aud spent some
 time in exploring the ruins

   jes link de liiglnes burned up dis yer place averred pomp

  begorra its the divils own job they med avil declared burney
 but frank said with conviction

 just as likely il was the work of cliff and his gang they are out-
 laws ui best and il rodman ranch was a respectable place they
 would be sure lo wish it destroyed

 barney nnd pomp re-entered the wagon now and once more the
 quest for rinci v was begun

 but night came on aud they had obtained no clew

 a good place was found lo cam and il was decided to wait until
 morning before pursuing the journey further

 accordingly everything was made comfortable with this end in
 view

 si camp liro wns made for this was not deemed necessary
 at nighi they always slept in the wagon and barney and pomp
 served turns in watching

 the tires in the hiruace were banked and ihe steam man was iven
 a test just the same as the others	

 one place was always as good us another in camping out thus save
 that ii was necessary lo lie n-ar a body of water so that the boilers
 could be fla with ease the next morninir

 the steam man was thus cared for ihe lire banked and everythin
 mad shipshape when after barney had been on watch not more than
 two hou-s the iirst of a series of thrilling incidents occurred

 the night was as dark as erebus not a star twinkled in the ether
 for heavy hlack clouds overhung all	

 suddenly barney saw a light glimmering far out on the prairie

 ion-time	 reeclble izo u continued lo blaze for a

 betverof wmalched    ng whe- the hi curiosit got the

  bejabers thats quare he muttered  ill make sure theres
 something wrong about that now	meres

 barney acting upon impulse leaned over and grasped franks
 shoulder tlio youtig inveutor awoke with a start

cuaptelt vii

the vigilaxts

 w-wiiats the matter gasped frank sleepily arousing himself

  whlsi now miaiher frank theres a quare loight out yonder on
 tha perairy an  thought id jint cull yure attiulion to the satne

 - a light muttered frank now fully awake

he got upon his feet aud rubbing his eyes stared at the distant

bl-that is odd he muttered  it will do to investigate that

  sure il may be a camp lire ventured barney
 ir so then we must find out who the campers are declared
 frank

 it was but ail instants work to arouse pomp

 then the llres in the furnace were ilurted a line of hose was run to
 a creek near and the boiler was filled

 iu an incredible short space of time steam was got up and the
 steam man moved ahead

 frank held the throttle reins aud directed the steam man s course
 toward the distantjeamp-tire 

 for such it was as became evident as they drew near

 at first no movement was made by the camping party and frank
 fancied that they had nobody on guard

 bui as the strain man willi clankiii tread came within one hundred
 yards of the cuinp a wild shout went up and a gun was discharged at
 the steam man

 frank was now able lo ee the circle of the camp as revealed by the
 firelight

 men had been rolled in blankets upon the ground to the number of
 a score

 but these were now dpon their feet jut beyond it could be seen
 that nuifltanga were corralled

frank reade jr had uo way of knowing whether the campers were

 friends or foes

 le bad fancied them a part of cliffs cowboys still there was a
 possibility they were not

 at any rate he conld not treat them a foes until he learned posi-
 tively tliat they were such

 so he brought the steam man to a stop just fifty yards from the
 canm

 the scene iu the camp now wa a ludicrous one

 the men were blind with mingled fear amazement and stupefaction
 at the sight of the steam man

 the fiery eyes and nostrils and mammoth proportions of the man in
 the darkness made him look like a monster from the infeniul regions

 the startled cries of the campers came to the amused hearing of
 those in the wagon

 great jericho what dyer call that thing

  its the devil liisself

  lies arter us

  that inst drink at ther cross trails was too much for us boys
 weve got em bad

  i reckon wed belter fix up a prayer thor old gentleman has com
 to git us

barney aud pomp exploded with laughter it was very tunny

 but as soon as the pandemonium had for a moment subsided frank
 lieade jr hastened to shout

 were human beings the same as vou have uo fear who

 aro you

 the words had an astounding effect upon the campers after a
 moment of stupefied silence the answer came back

  who the dlckf-ns are you

  i am frank reade jr and this is my new invention the steain
 man replied frank  vou have nothing lo fear

 the cumpors now saw the three inon in the wagon as ramey turn-
 ed oil the light of the calcium and illuminated the vicinity

 al once their fear fled and a comprehension of all dawned upou them
  a steam man by thunder aud built all of iron

  wall that beats ell

  whatll come noxl

 that heals the iron hossall holler

 the canipers now came thronging about the wagon as the nnm-
 ber wus limited frank did not eel particularly uneasy thongh be
 held the inrotlle ready and barney and pcmp had their repeaters at
 liaod

but the feara otjour three adventurers were quickly allayed

 one of the men a tall powerful framed man came forward and
 said

  wall capen were glad to meet you anyer steam man my
 name is aim harmon an im capialn of this band who are all vigi-
 lams from poker gulch were out on the trail of a gang of ruffians

   lgllants cried frauk reade jr with joy  then you are not
 members of the artemas clitl gang

 artemas clitlcried harmon lie is the chap we want if we
 can lay hands on him well etreich his neck you bet dyer know
 whar we kin find him	

   am on his trail myself

  the deuce ye are

 itsihe truth

  what tor

bo told him explicitly of the mysterious murder of which jim trav
frank reade jr and his new steam man



 era hail beeu adjudged guilty but which it was believed was tbe work
 o clill

 harmon listened with interest

 so thats another gume of ilier cuss he cried  wall thats a
 bail one but i reckon weve a wuss count agin him stranger

  indeed exclaimed frank

  did ye cum across tiier ruins of a ruch out hyar on ther peralry
 some miles	

 i did

 wnll that was onct rodman ranch an ralph rodman was ore
 of the best men iu this part of ther west but that ornery cusi cliil
 fell iu love with pretty bessie rodman his darter an when ralph
 denied him the riglu lo come a-cnurtin her ther scoundrel jest
 brought down a gang of hoodlums an burned down the ranch toted
 oil ther gal an killed all ther rest about ther place

 uorrinle- exclaimed frank  but you have not told ine of rod-
 man what became of biin

  wall that illnstrates ther villainy of iher cuss just previous lo
 buniio ther ranch two men sid bowen an jem ducey hired by
 cliir enticed ralph to new york by bringin him a bogus message

 but ive heard that bowen an ducey have returned an rodman
 didni cum with em its my belief lies been done away with an
 its alt a game of cliffs lo get llie gal bessie into his possession

 a great cry bioke from the lips or frank reade jr

 tliis story of ilarnion s he had listened lo eagerly and as it was
 unfolded bit by bit a clear concise comprehension of all now came
 to him

 he saw the hideous details the cold scheming construction of a
 deep aud awful plot involving murder und abduction aud terrible
 wrong

 great heavens he gasped wiping cold perspiration from his
 brow your story throws a great light upon the matter which i
 have in hand mr harmon

 the deuce you say gasped the captain of the vigilantes

 it is the truth cried frank  x think i can lell you the true
 fate of ralph rodman ami you will agree that clill is the projector of
 one of the most awful double plots of crime that human being could
 be capable of

 the vigilantes all gathered around the young inventor agog with
 interest

 ye dont mean it gasped harmon with amazement yere
 huntin cliff then ther same as we are

  yus 

 wbatfer

 to force a confession or explanation from him of a mysterious
 mnrder of which his own uncle james travers of new york has
 been adjuged guilty and who i now in prison awaiting his sentence
 of hanging about a year from now

 oil this villain is a deep one ent i have told you of that mys-
 terious murder and as heaven is my judge i believe the victim of
 that muider which was purposely thrown upon travers was rodmnn
 you see cliffs object in throwing the murder upon travers was to see
 him hang and thus inherit his vast wealth

 for a moment ufler this statement silence reigned

 appalled with the magnitude oklie villains plot all remained si-
 lent bul llie mystery was cleared up at last

 all understood now exactly the deep game of artemas cliff

 but one sentiment reigned supreme iu the breasts of all artemas
 cliff should be brought to justice

 it was easy enough to see how the wretch in planning to win bessie
 rodman had enticed rodman to llie east and there murdered him
 then to kill two birds with one stone he had caused ihe awful crime
 by clever circumstantial evidence to be thrown upon bis wealthy uncle
 james travers

 of course with travers death he would inherit tbe millions left by
 him

 ralph rodman was dead the ranch was a heap of ashen

 for these crimes arlemas cliff was responsible but bossie rod-
 man was yet in bis power travers was near the gallows

 these two people must be saved

 frank reade jr saw the mission as did harmon

 lustinctively they clasped hands

  i reckon we both know what to do declared the vigilant captain
 tersely  praps we kin work together ill help you all i kin

  and i will help you replied frank  we will bring cliff to jus-
 tice it the steam man can help us to do it

  he will hang i i kin get my hands onto him

  but we must make no mistake he is strongly backed up you
 have only twenty-live men with you

  but they air all men replied harmon pluckily

  i will not question that replied frank  but the weight of num-
 bers would defeat you cliff has several hundred men in his com-
 mand

  were not afraid of em yet yere right ennff its well fer us to
 go easy	

  it is well to be careful said frank  i think that you had bet-
 ter keep along with us for a time

 all right

  i think there is no doubt bul that the young girl whom pomp saw
 in the hills was bessie rodmnn

 in course it was her

  they were taking her to ranch v do you know where it is

  yus replied harmon quickly  thats on stone river an its a
 pesky big place too thors a big stockade around il an armed men
 are alius a-watchin for fear an outsider will gll in so thats ther
 place eh wall it will be hard to git bessie out of ranch v

  she slmll be got out or i will give my life in the attempt cried a
 tall handsome young plainsman with qushinz eyes

 lie looked much in earnest frank gazeil at him critically a
 little laier he was introduced to him as walter barrows a rising
 young stockman and the lover of pretty bessie rodman

chapter viii

ox to ranch v

 plans were quickly made

 it was decided  work upon strategical grounds as their force was
 so much lighter than dills

  you see if we cau strike ranch v at a time when clill an i the
 majority of bis men are ill the hills we can capture the place declared
 flank shrewdly

  thats biznesa agreed narmon  bul yere the boss i kir seo
 that yeve got a better head piece nor i bave mister reade

  wo will not admit that said frank modestly but rather let
 us work together mr harmon

  all right capen im with ye

 futlier plans were elaborated then as only a few hours yet inter-
 vened until dawn il was decided to snatch a fow brief hours f sleep

 with ihe early dawn all were astir the vigllants saddled their
 mustangs end all was soon ready for the start

tbe steam man was an object of great wonder to the plainsmen

  by jinks exclaimed one of them  ihe sight of llml queer-
 lookin critter oughter scare llie life out of any nutnner of injuns

 i	think the steam man will aid us much in accomplishing our
 ends said frank modestly

 the start was made just after daybreak the vigilauts rode along-
 side the sleam man on their mustangs

of course frank was compelled to go more slowly on this account

 but the vigilantes knew the way lo ranch v and this was after
 all the most important thing of all

 frank considered it a great piece of luck in having falen in with
 the vigilantes

 he now understood exactly how matters stood all around

 it was near noon when a halt was called id a small basin near a
 lake of water

 here camp wnb briefly made and also at the same time an impor-
 tant discovery caire to hand

 a broad trail made by a cavalcade of men and horses was dis-
 covered

 it pointed to the north

 harmon examined it carefully and finally with great exuberance
 cried

 its good luck friends that thar trail  believe was made ther
 cowboys ar it leads to ther hills its over three days old an they
 havent come back this way i should think that the most f their
 men must be up there in which case ranch v will be almost deserted
 cum on boys lets capture ther hull place

 with a cheer the vigilants sprang lo saddle

 soon they were oree more galloping over the prairie

 not two hours lateror in the middle of the afternoon harmon drew
 his horse alongside ihe steam man and pointing to the south cried

  look yonder mr reade do ye bee them lines of high ground
 wall jest this side ar ther ranch v

 a cheer went up from all

  begorra its ranch ours itll be if iver we get there declared
 barney

  golly wont dis be a big sprise party o dat vilyan cliff cried
 pomp

 frank reade jr held the steam man at a steady stride and very
 soon the ranch came in sight

 it was truly a most exteusive establishment

 the stockade and buildings covered acres of grouud a great herd
 of cattle were feeding on the open plains

 the main ranch itself was surrounded by a high stockade which
 would resist most any ordinary attack with small nrms

 as the vigilauts and the steam man came swiftly rushing down
 npon the place a great commotion was seen to take place

 men rushed out into ihe yards horseineu weut scurrying about
 and down came the stockade atp

 but harmon and his men rode boldly down to the gate and began
 to assail it with axes

 while frank reade jr kepi the steam man on an elevation near
 from which he with barney and pomp covered the work of invasion
 by a hot lire with their winchesters

 the cowboys could not get upon the stockade to bre at the assail-
 ants for this reason

 harmons men therefore worked with perfect immunity

no more favorable lime for an attack could have been chosen

 there were bul few of the cowboys in the ranch and these were
 picked off by the lire from the sleam man as fast as they appeared on
 the stockade

 with lusty cries the vigilants chopped through the timbers of the
 gate

 iu a remarkably brief time a hole was cut through and the gate
 raised

the steam man rushed into the yard and in less than tea mfn-


frank reade jr and his new sleam man

ules every cowboy iu the place was a prisoner and raucli v was capt-
ured

 walter barrows ibe brave young stockman was the nrst to enter
 the malu ranch

 the iuatinct of a lover took him to the chamber in which bessie
 rodman was kept a prisoner

 he burst in the door and clasped the young girl in hla arms

 that was a joyous meeting

 when they appeared in the yard the vigilants cheered wildly it
 was a brilliant victory

rauch v was captured	

 the stronghold of ihe outlaw cliff the don of villainy and vice
 was caplured ll did not require much lime for them  reach a de-
 cision as to what to do

 every building must be laid low cried harmon pul the torch
 to every accursed limber

 the cry was takeu up and spread from lip to lip

 in haste torches were procured uarinou himself lit the first and
 was about lo apply it to a building

 bui be did not do so

 a thrilling incident stopped him a loud cry went up

 the cowboys they are coining to arms everybody there
 comes clifl at liieir head

 every eye was turned to the pluiu beyond the stockade

 there was no disputing the truth cliff and his gang returning
 from the hills had come just in time

 il would be folly now to burn ihe ranch

 harmon seeing the desperate exigency dropped the torch an  cried
  to ihe blockade ils for life or deah hoys fight to tlie last
 bjt the command was not necessary already the brave vigilants
 were at their posts

 cliff with bis small army of followers came on at a swinging gallop
 he could see lhat the ranch was iu the possession of a foe

 this iutlamed his wrath and wilh loud curses and yells he rode
 down in the van of bis followers

 frank reade jr had taken in the situation at a glance

 he knew tbal it would be flatly impossible for the score of vigilants
 to hold those three huudred desperadoes long at bay

 ll	would mean ihe eveutual massacre of every vigilant this frank
 wished to avoid

 the young inventor had induced bessie rodman to seek refuge in
 the wagon otherwise she would certainly fall into the hands of the
 foe again

 frank started the steam man ahead and went down to the stock-
 ade lie made the vigilantes a hasty address

 nothing will be gained by holding this place lie declared wilh
 force  you cannot do il the odds are too great

  but we cannot surrender cried harmon  and how can wo
 retreat

  easily enough  replied frank there is a rear gate open it
 and cut out upon the prairie

  but lliey may overtake us

  it is your only hope youll have lo work lively for they are try-
 ing to surround ihe blockade pll cover your retreat easy enough
 harmon baw that frank was right

 ue did not pause to argue ihe point further with quick com-
 mands he caused his men lo fall back

 the stockade gate iu the rear was openod just iu time and ihe vigi-
 lants rushed oul upcn ihe prairie

 tney set out al a mad gallop for the distant hills

 the cowboys witli mad cries followed but thoy met wilh quite a
 serious obstacle in their pursuit

 the steam man kept exasperalingly between them and the vigi-
 lants

 from the rear loopholes of the wagon barney and pomp kept np a
 steady lire with the winchesters

 nearly every shot emptied a saddle and dospite their superior num-
 bers the cowboys soon found il better and safer to keep well out of
 range

 the pursuit lasted for ten miles then the horses of both parties
 became fagged and they were compelled lo halt

 but harmons men by dint of careful work got their horses into
 the fastnesses of the hills here they felt more secure

 the steam man had well covered the retreat of the vigilants bat
 darkness was now coming  aud a serious question presented ilself
 to frank reade jr

 to remain where they were for the night would be to incur the risk
 of a midnight attack from the cowboys

 this might result seriously

 al least frank was disposed to evade it

 he consulted wilh harmon and the result was an arrangement
 which it was believed would be better for all

 iu the fastnesses of the bills harmon felt sanguine of lioldiug his
 own against the cowboys

 therefore il was decided that the steam man should leave the vi-
 cinity and go far euough away over the prairie to make sure of safety
 for the liight

 accordingly frank left the vicinlly and sent the man striding over
 the plain in the dusk of evening

 there was no visible indication lhat the cowboys ialended to our-
 eue	r

 they had apparently gone into camp not live miles distant

 frank kepi on wilh the steam man until iweuty miles had been
 covered-

 then he came to a halt

 it seemed as if they must feel safe bore accordingly arrangements
 were made for passing the night

 i	comfortable seat was arrange  for bessie rodman and raucli ex-
 hausted by the fatigue of her experiences she qmckly fell asluep

 bui tears had wet her cheeks and trembled on her eyelashes frank
 had told her of her fathers death

 oh  fear it is more than i can bear she decared in agjnv of
 spirit my dear dear father oh if i were a man how  would

 there are plenty to do lhat replied frank cheeringly thevil-
 lain shall surely pay for his evil deeds

  i hope it mav come to pas- she said sincerely

 then she dropped oil to sleep but even as she slept deadly peril
 hung over her youug and beautiful head

chapter ix

pomps mistake

 frank reade jr fell comparatively safe as lie rolled himself up
 in a blanket and went lo sleep he did not believe that the villain
 cliff would be able to molest them that night

 it was barneys flri-t watch

 the hiberniun until midnight kept a good lookout in the cage
 then he called pomp to succeed him

 the darky kept a good lookout unlil the early morning hours

 the darkness was most intense

 at about this time pomp experienced a deadiy faintness at ihe pit
 of the stomach and a groat longing for water

 his thirst became most consuming aud il seemed as it he must ai
 any cost gratify iu

 bui he found upon looking in the tank that it was empty

 there was  a gill of cold water in the wagon pomp grew bober
 with this dampening reflection

  i jes link if i had a bit of watab i would be a right he mutter-
 ed  but how -ibber am dis niggah gwine fo to eel it dats whal id
 like to kuow

 pomp went to the steel screen and tried to penetrate the darkness

 ue knew that not ten yards distant were the waters of a small
 creek he could hear them rippling now

 ii	was directly at variance wilh his orders to open the cge doar
 yet il seemed to pomp as if be must do so

 the risk did not seem great

 there seemed little likelihood of the proximity of a foe

 pomp fell certain lhat lie coold reach the creek get his drink anil
 gel back safely to the wagon

 he was sorely tempted the desire was most powerful

 golly he muttered wilh a wry face  what am i gwine fo lo
 do i don beliebe dars any danger ob eoing out dar but if marse
 frank knew it hed lix me putty quick sakes allbe but what ora a
 chile gwine fo lo do i am mos dyln fo a drink ob waah

 pomp thought of awukeuing barney and enlisting bis aid

 bui he reflected lhat the cell would be certain lo disagree wilb his

 echeme

 there was no other way but to assume the responsibility himself
 pomp drew a deep breath

 then he fell  listening

 all was silent as the grave

 sio he muttered  dar aint no danger at all ill jesl tab
 dat wotuh as suah as im born

 ue quickly slid back the boll in the door and opened it

 then he stepped out of the wagon in another moment be glided
 down  the waters edge

 pomp llung himself llut and began to drink of the creek water

 but he had not taken one drink when he became aware of an appall-
 ing sensation lie turned his head and glanced back al llic siram

 man

 the lantern banging in the cage showed the open door and all a-
 plain as day but great heavens what did he see

 dark forms were swarming about the machine one was already in
 ihewagon

 pomp saw this much and then his attention was claimed by another
 matter ue suddenly felt a heavy body descend npon him and talon
 lingers clutched lus ihroal

 iii	that flash of time pomp had turned partly over

 he was just in lima to ee the flash of a knife blade he made a
 convulsive upward blow and grasped the wrist of his unknown as-
 bailaot

 by the merest chance the death blow had been averted

 but it was a close call

 then with a herculean effort pomp rolled over the edge of the bank
 and ihe next moment with a powerful swing he had brought him-
 self and assaileut into the water of ihe creek

 the sudden bath caused pomps adversary to relax his grip

 the darky had no further motive for continuing the slroggle
 and striking out swam for the opposite bank

 he clambered out of the water and crawled into a thicket

 there lie lay shivering aud wituessed a thrilling scene npon the
 other bank of the creek

 the occupants of the wagon had all been aroused and were every
 one prisoners in the power of cliff and lus cowbovs

 the outlaw had managed to cover the twentv miles skillfully follow-
 ing the trail by means of a dark lantern

 lie had been hovering wilh his minions about the steam man just
 as i omp committed the indiscretion of leaving the door open
frank reade jr and iii new steam man



 of course it was an easy matter tor the cowboys lo board the wagon
 and make prisoners of all on board

 the glee of cliff was beyond expression

 lie danced and clapped his hands wilh fiendish joy he pinched
 bessies arms until she screamed with agony and with brutal laughter
 roared

  oh ill make ye all danco ye thought yed git away from me
 did ye gait ill show ye lhat ye caut gel away from ariemaa cliff
 ha ha im wliat a good joke

 he laughed uproariously

 all mine lie continued  and this steam man this wonderful
 invention is just what  wont i can travel around iu great style
 oh mr frank reade jr ill dance on your grave yet

 monster cried frank writhing in his bonds  youll never
 succeed a righteous god will never permit it

 the villain gave his men carle blanche to make camp and indulge

 lo	a carousal

 they did so until daybreak and then cliff stated tbal it was his
 purpose to go back to ranch v

 ll did not take him long to understand the mechanism of the steam
 man

 ne quickly found out how to use the throttle reins lie was aided
 by the tael that he bad once been a locomotive engineer

 wilh the early morning light the start for ranch v was made

 and pomp wet and shivering and horrified crouched in the thicket
 upon ihe bank of the creek saw the sleam man and bis friends all
 in the power of the foe lake depart

 when lhey had gone pomp came out of his hiding-place

  golly he muttered wilh distended eyeballs i jes fink dis nig-
 ger hah done de berry awfulest ling eber known dar am only oiie
 way lo pomp to sabe his honor an dat am to lix some way to rescue
 marse frank an all ob lie odders an ill do it if i can

 pomp was very mncj in earnest

 he was a brave and generous fellow and willing at any time lo sac-
 rifice his life for his master

 iu some manner he must certainly vindicate himself he crossed
 the creek again and stood upon the spot where the steam man had
 beer

 of course the machine was out of siht by this time but neverthe-
 less pomp look the trail and proceeded to follow it

 for some hours he trudged on over the prairie all the while the
 darky was revolving in his mind some plan for the relief of his friends

 ho was bound to admit lhat it wa a puzzle yet he did not lose
 hope

 the hills were every moment becoming plainer already pomp had
 covered live of the twenty miles

 tledarky was a good walker and no distance was too great for his
 trained muscles

 the sun was beginning to run high in ihe heavens and p brisk
 breeze blew across the prairie

 pomp kept on steadily

 the trail kept on toward the hills and the sagacious darky reflected
 that cliff was likely going to join the main body of his men

 ijesfink i can see what dat rascal am up to muttered pomp
  he am jus too sharp to let de game slip him once he gits his clutches
 onto it he am jus goin fo to lake de steam man lo his ranch v
 and dars whar dis darky must go an try fo to work some leelle plan
 fo lo rescue frank reade jr an de odders dat am a fac

 with this logical conclusion pomp trudged on

 he was now on the last live miles of his journey to the hills the
 bua was long past the noon hour when pomp by dint of rapid walk-
 ins had made the hills

 there was no sign visible of ihe steam man or of the comboys

 bni pomp saw tbal the trnil continued around ihe base of the hills
 this puzzled the darkey a moment

 he paused and scratched bis head in deep thought

 dili am a  re flu i queer thing he mutlered  dat ainl de way
 to to ranch v if ise right in mah conjecksiiun

 then he paused and a light of comprehension broke acrshis face
 a distant sound had come to his hearing it was the faint rattle of
 fire-arms fur up in llie hills

 golly he ejaculated i see de irick ob dat berry sharp fox
 artemus cllrt lie am gwine fo to gib de vigilants a good lickin
 afore lie goes to ranch v dat am jus my bes way for to jiue marse
 harmon an his men an help dem irnsh ihe cowboys

 pomps mind was made up

 he would join the vigilants and do his best to give the cowboys a
 good drubbing he at once slruck inlo the bills

 but alas for pomp

 luck seemed against the darky for the time being he hail not
 more llian fairly entered a narrow pass when ail appalling incident
 occurred

 the air was suddenly broken by wild yells and in an instant he was
 surrounded by half a hundred painted savages who burst from niches
 tfnd crevices in ihe rocks about

 they pounced upon him and before pomp had even time to think
 of resistance he was a prisoner

 the savages swarmed aboui him like bee words cannot express
 pomps dismay nt this turn

 his eye bulged and his knees shook a with the ague	

  fo de good lor dis am driitful lie groaned  ise done fo di
 time an dar am nobody lo rescue marse frank

 it was truly a dubious outlook the savages were of black iluttalos
 gang of sioux and they seemed much elated al getting the prisoner
 once more inlo their clutches

 they chatwred and gesticulated like a flock of magpies and me
 of them approached pomp wiili their tomahawks os though they would
 fain make an end of him then and there

 but the others held ihem back aud an excited wrangle followed

 all ibis while pomp was writhing in bis bonds iu vain he tried to
 break them

 for some while the savages wrangled then a compromise wa
 made and pomp was picked up bodily and carried ihrough the pass
 and into a small glade anmng some trees

 here be was lied lo a tree and a great heap of fagots were piled al
 bis feet

 wilh a chill of horror the darky saw lhat the savages meant to
 lako bis life in a horrible manner

 ho was to sailer death in the flames pomp fell sick and faint
 but ever in that moment he thought not of himself brave tellow bul
 of frank reade jr and the others

 golly sakes whoebber am gwine fo to sabe marse frank now
 he groaned

chapter x

ix the enemys power

 artemcs cuff shouted in evil glee and triumph ns he manipulated
 the slenm man anil lei him out for a swifi run across the prairie

 lie amused himself by racing with his followers who were on horse-
 back

  by jingo he roared this is more fun than i ever had before
 why ibis beats the steam-cars all to smash and ils all mine why

 i	can travel like a prince now ha-ba-ha im the luckiest man on
 earth

 he turned and fixed a glowering gaze upon bessie rodman

  and yere mine loo lie cried  the lily of the prairie the happy
 life companion of arlemus cliff when i gel my hands onto uncle
 jim travers millions well travel ihe world over my daisy

 bessie did not appear to heed his words bough her face increased
 a trifle in ils pallor

 monster cried frank reade jr with intensity you will
 never succeed heaven will not permil it

  heaven dont have much lo do with mo cried ihe villain with
 a lurid oath  the devil has been a good friend of mine and i aint
 afraid of his place either

 begorra they wudnl have ye even there cried barney -yez
 are too wicked for avin that place

  oh ho irish youve got your tonguo eh cried clifl with a
 vicious laugh  so ye think im too bad eh

 be me sowl thnr cudnt be a place too bad for yez

 ill have a nice little hades tlxed fer yer right on this earth an
 ill give ye a fair taste of il in advance too said llie villain venge-
 fully

 arrali yez cant scare me at all al all he relorod yer
 threats nre jisl the same as a puppy dogs bark

  youll lind that im the kind of a dog that bites averred the
 villain

  its not me that cares fer yer bites

 well see about that dont blow your horn too soon

  begorra thats good advice fer yersllf ye bluherskiu- av i
 ony had me two hands to use now id baste the rascality o u av yez
 or id make a good job fer iher undhertaker

 talk is cheap sneered the villain yed belter savo yer
 wind

 ils yersilf as nades it mosl said barney bouni lo have the last
 word

 cliff evidently found barneys tongue equal to his own for be aban-
 doned the conversation in a sullen fashion

 liessio rodman made no attempt al speech

 she snt silently in one corner of the wagon

 frank reade jr also remained silent

 the twenly miles were quickly covered by llie steam man il was
 yet far from llie coon hour when they arrived at tho camp of the pre-
 vious night

 the cowbows in full force were there anj ns clitt appeared with bo
 steam man they made the welkin ring wilh yells of delighl and falis-
 faction

 all crowded around to examine the team wonder and inspect it
 mechanism

 the prisoners looked out upon a sea of faces they were not kindly
 regarded by ihe cowboys

  take em out and shoot em cliff cried a voice in the crowd

  give em twenly paces and a grave seven feel deep

 bul cliff refused lo do this

  leave il lo mo he cried  ive got a belter plan

  wbat is it was the cry

   want ye all to bo ready in half an hour lo go inlo ihe iull an
 corner harmon an his gang there must not one uf llie vigilanls
 go out of here alive

  ilurrah yelled the cowboys

  we can give them ihe worst thrnshin they ever had

  i course we can

  i regard to iheso prisoners tlio gal is going to he my wife tiio
 others im going to have some fun with down to llie ranch well
 have a rabbit chase with em or something of the kind
frank reade jr and his new steam man



  good yelled the mob carried away wiih llie plan

 thus ihe fate of the prisoners was decided by their captors but
 tbe question of attack upon the visilanls was now the one  order

 preparations were at once made for cornering harmon and bis he-
 roic little band

  several parlies of cowboys were dispatched to head off any possible
  attempt at escupe from llie bills

  harmous men were certainly hemmed in on all sides and il was a
  most dubious outlook for lliem

  the exultation of the cowboys was beyond expression

   weve got em dead sure cried cliff triumphantly  not a one
  on em can possibly escape

  the cowbovs now began to close the line in about llieir prey

 a puss was found through which the steam man was taken and to
 a poml wiihin easy range of be position held by the vigilauts

 hannon had choaea an elevated position od a kind of small table-
 land or plateau	 

  here behind bowlders he had concentrated his forces tbe position
  was nol a bad one to defend

 to cburge upon it the cowboys would bave to ascend a height of
 flfiy feet or more ip the face of a strong fire

  but ibis sacrilice of men cliff did not intend to make at loast nol
  at once

  there were other points of vantage about which the cowboys quickly
  took possession of

 from these a desultory dre was kept up with the vigilants with
 some loss upon both sides

 but harmons men could not very well withstand any loss what-
 ever this the cowboys cculd stand better

 the steam man however could advance to very close proximity
 with the vigilants aud those on board were safe from any shots of
 retaliation

 this made it bad for harmon for lie bad no way of checking this
 most destructive lire

  it was a most galling thing for frank reade jr to remain idle and
  see ids invention ased in such a manner

  lie groaned aloud with horror and dismay barney did the same
  woh if i could only free myself declared the young inventor

   begorra i wish  cud do that same muttered barney

  clilf and the three cowboys with him in ihe cage were doing their
  best to shoot every vigilant who exposed himself

  they were thus so deeply engrossed that they paid no special heed
  to the prisoners for the time

  barney quick-witted irishman noted this fact

  at a favorable moment he leaned over and whispered to frank

  bejabers misther frank i think  know av away to turn tbe
 tables on them blasted omadhouns

   the deuce gasped frank  what is it barney

 whisht now an work quiet me gossfon whispered barney
  ill luy down ferninal the side here an yez kin turn yer wrists to-
 ward me mouth an me teeth are no good av i doui cui them in two
 before so very fong

  frank experienced a thrill

   can you do it barney

   av course  kin

   but if they see us-

  theyll niver do tuat be aisy now me gossoon an roight on
 the shelf there theres a knolfe an yez kin cut my bonds at the same
 toime thin we kin take care av ther four av thim ill take wo
 mesilf

  and im good for the other two or ill die muttered frank
  all right barney do your best

   i will that

 but at ibis moment besie rodman leaned forward and in a soft
 whisper said

   walt tnere is a quicker way

 frank and barney were astonished

   what exclaimed ihe young inventor

  by way of reply bessie drew both hands from behind ter

  they were free there were livid lines upon the fair wrists where
  the cruel throngs had cut in

  but the shapely hands were so small that bessie had been enabled
  to slip them through ihe bonds and free them

 up to this moment neither frank nor burney had looked upon the
 youn- girl as more than the ordinary weak woman

  that is lo say they had not given her credit for tbe amount of nerve
  she possessed

  but they were given ample evidence of it now

 juick as a flash and with commendable resolution she reached
 over hod seized tbe knife upon the shelf

  it was but a moments work for her to cut franks bonds as they
  snapped the young inventor took the knife and quickly cut barneys
  their captors were at the loop-holes firing and had not seen this
  move

  nothing could have worked belter

 frank picked np a club and barney an iron bar nobody can
 handle a weapon of the sort better than an irishman

  whurroo bad cess to yez fer a pack av omodhouns cried bar-
 ney dealing one of the cowboys a crashing blow on the head

 before one could think lle iron bar came down upon the head
 of another both sank senseless lo the boor of tbe wa-on

 i	lank rende jr bad knocked clill senseless onlyone of the
 loe was left and he was quickly knocked out

  iu a twinkling as il were the tables were turned

 barnev and frank reade jr were now masters of the steam mnn
 once more the irrepressible irishman pulled the whistle valve and
 sent up a shriek of dellance am triumph

 then frank reade jr swung open the wagon door

 throw them out he cried a bul clilf

 barney obeyed the command tbe three cowboys were quickly
 dumped out upon ihe ground	

 but ciiir was allowed to remain the yillam lay insensible in the
 bottom of the wagon

 frank was about lo bind him when an imminent peril claiming his
 immediate attention prevented him

 the cowboys were aware of tbe turning of he tables in he wagon

 with mad yells they were rushing forward in a body to surround
 ihe steam man unless immediate action was made they would snc-

 frank knew well the danger of this move

 it would be an easy matter for the cowboys to rui the invention by
 a single blow there wns but one way and that was to beat a re-
 treat

 barney seized his repoater and began tiring inlo the crowd of cow-
 boys frank opened the throttle and sent the sleam man up the in-
 cline toward the stronghold of the vigilants

 of course the latter hud seen and understood all

 they embraced the opportunity to pour a hank tire into the ranks of
 the cowboys il was a momentof thrilling sort but the steam man
 seemed to have the best of it when n thrilling incident happened

chapter xi

with tub vigilants

 in another moment the steam man would have been in tbe ranks
 of the vigilants

 il would have been a great ponl scored for cliff wouid then be a
 prisoner and the way to save jim tr tvers from the gallows would
 bave been paved

 but il was nol to be

 the villain had come to in the meanwhile but cunning rascal that
 he was had laid inanimate in the bottom of the wagon

 he had seen all liiat was goug on and when he saw that ihe sleam
 man wa certain to escape he knew that only desperate action upon
 his part would save him now

 accordingly while frank and barney were occupied at their posts
 he made a sudden lightning leap for the door ill the cage

 unfortunately barney bad not fastened il

 a little scream of warning came from beesie but il was too late

 the villain hung open the door and sprung out

 he tumbled heels over head down the decline

 this was partly done on purpose avoid any bullets sent after him
 bul none struck him and he was llie next moment in the ranks of
 his men

 frank turned just in time to see the daring escape

 the young inventors disappointment was ao great that he came
 near leaving the wagon to pursue llie villain

  begorra av ther diviioinl got clane away entoirely cried barney
 in dismay

 im sorry returned frank but take the precaution now
 barney lo bolt that iloor

 burney complied with alacrity

 then he was obliged lo return to his post for the enemy were thick
 in the rear

 but the next moment the steam man topped the rise

 a volley from tbe vigilants drove the cowboys bnck for the time

 then frank reade jr brought tbe machine to a halt upon tbe
 plateau

 the vigilants were wild with delight and crowded about the steam
 man frank reade jr opened the door and descended among ihem

 in an instant harmon was by his side and had gripped his hucd

 god bless ye mr reade cried ibe whole-souled plainsman
 lls like lakin the pnw of one brought back from the dead dog-
 dnst it but id given ye up entirely when i see that your steam man
 was in the hands of that coyote its all like a kind of miracle

 i think we may congratulate ourselves said frank  but do j
 know that we are in a tight box

 nobody knows il better declared harmon

  i doubt if we pull out of it

  what kin we do

 is there no avenue open for retreat asked frank

 not a one

 then we can only stay here and light to the last of conrse 
 might be able to elude them with the steam man but id never trv
 that while any of your band are left

 praps it would be ther besl way said harmon generously
  at least you could save llie gal it dont matter so much about us
 were only rough men and not a one of us afeared lo die

 you are heroes cried frank with fervor and it i should de-
 sert you i would forswear my honor as a man no the sleamman
 will stay here and light for you until the last depend on it

 in course we need your help replied harmon mebie well
 whip ther kunks yet

   well iry it

  begorra that we will cried barney  whurroo av i only bad
 a good whack at that baste av a clilf now id sphoil his beauty
 foriver

 walter barrows and bessie had been holding a joyful conference
 bul now the order went up
frank reade j and his new steam man



 every man lo his post the enemy are coming

 there were no delinquents not one in lhat heroic little band hung
 back

 ii was true thm the foe were coming again lo the attack

 with cliff leading them they were charging furiously up tlio hili
 bui the vigilants stood firm anil gave them a raking volley

 kora momenl they wavered then once more they came on

 cliffs voice couid-be heard as lie rallied them

 curse ye go on up tliar and kill tho hull crew of em he
 yelle  dont let one of ihem escape alive kill em every one
 and dont give any quarter

  well see about that muttered frank reade jr  it mav
 not be so easy to do all that mr cliff

 frauk and barney from their position aboard the steam man
 could pour a terrible lire into the tanks of the foe

 it was a terrible battle

 the cowboys were mowed down like grain before the sickle yet
 they did not waver but came on faster

 every moment they drew nearer the top of the rise ii they sur-
 rounded it the sequel would be brief

 overpowering muscles would quickly tell tho story and ihe little
 band of tigilonis would be wiped out of existence

 it was without doubt clifla purpose to give no quarter a whole-
 sale massacre would be ihe resglt

 the vigilants were now lighting for their lives as well die facing
 the foe as with back turned every man was resolute in this

 bal the tremendous body of men swept over the rise and gained the
 plateau in a twinkling the vigilants were surrounded and il seemed
 as if no power would intervene to save them from sure aud total ex-
 tinction

 frank reade jr look in the situation at a glance and cried de-
 spairingly

 barney we are lost our end has come aud we are as good as
 dead meu already

 poor pomp saw no way out of the awful situation m which be wa
 placed

 death in its most awful form was npon him

 a worse fate could not be imagined

 tlie savages piled ihe brushwood about him and danced with
 demoniac yells about tbe pile

 if pomp could have turned pale he would liave been whiter than
 chalk at that moment

 but for all this tbe darkys fears were even now more for hia friends
 than for himself

 golly massy he chattered shivering like one with the agiw
 whalebber will be de end ob all dls yere iae gwine fo to lie
 burned to death nnd marse frank in de clutches ob dal rascal cliff
 an nobody to rescue him oh good lor il am ilreflul

 il was indeed a dreadful thing

 bat pomp was certainly powerless higher the brushwood waa
 heaped and then one of ihe savages advanced with a torch

 iu a momenl he had applied it to the pile

 the dry wood burned like tinder in an instant great flames sprang
 up

 bui they were at tbe edge of the pile however pomp felt their
 heat and they would soon reach him

 the poor darky was nearly insane with a frenzy of desperation

 the savages now bogan a uendish dance about the pile they
 leaped and ran and swuug their tomahawks and made hideous faces
 al their victim

 but fate had not ordained lhat this was lo be pomps end

 even while death seemed certain rescue was close al hand

 suddenly there smote upon the air tbe ring of horses hoofs and a
 quick sharp order followed by the crash of carbines

 indians tell in heap before that volley a panic resulted and the
 next moment through the smoke pomp saw the-gleaia of uniforms
 and knew that a body of united states cavalry had happened upon
 the xt jast in the nick of time

 	the darky was besidehimaelf with the realization

 he tried to break hia bonds and cried

 sabe me sogers-sabe pomp he am gwine fo suah to burn to
 death ef yo lion sube him

 bui the call waa not necessary

 through the smoke sprang two dismounted soldiers in a twink-
 ling the burning brush was kicked aside and pomps bonds were cut

 then tbe darky was face to face with a tail handsome young
 officer

 the indians had been dispersed and the fight was over

  i am col clark of the united states seventh cavalry said tbe
 young officer  who are you

 i am pomp waa the darkys prompt reply

 the officer smiled

  well who do you belong to

  i belongs to marae frank reade jr replied pomp with em-
 phasis  ae a free nigger bnl i goea wherebber marse frauk goes
 jest de same

 oh  see replied the officer well where is your master jusl
 now

  golly for goodness cried pomp excitedly  lie am in a heap
 b irubble an yo kin help him out of it

 with this pomp lold clark all about the steam man aud their mis-
 sion in the west

 the young colonel listened with deep interest and then when ap-
 prised of the facl lhat the steam man nnd its passengers were iu the
 hands of ciiir lie cried excitedly

  by jupiter that man clill is just the chap i am after word
 was brought to the fori some time ago of a den of thieves up here with
 a rendezvous called ranch v do you know of it

  golly sakes marbu colonel cried pomp excitedly yo kin jest
 hell does jes yo find de cowboys and rescue marse frank aud ho
 done show yo where de ranch v are

 it slmlf be done if we are able said colonel clark

 he turned lo ins men who were scattered about the vicinity having
 been engagd in driving the savages out of the valley

 bui tho bunle quickly recalled lliem

 a spare horse was brought forward for pomp mid then the cavalry-
 men in solid body rode out of the valley

 as lliey struck the prairie below the distant sounds of firing came

 lo	their ears

 il was ihe din of the conflict between the vigilants and the cow-
 boys aided by the sounds colonel clark waa able to gallop straight

 lo	the scene

 through a pasa in the hills they reached the plateau they burst
 upon the cowboys in the rear just at the critical moment when il
 seemed as if harmons heroic little band was doomed

 il required but a glance for clark lo take in the situation

 whirling his sabre uloft lie spurred ids horse forward with the thrill-
 ing command

 forward charge

chapter xii

tdli fortunes of war

 just at that momenl when utter destruction threatened ihe brave
 little band of vigilants the us soldiers cams upon the scene

 nothing could have been more opportune

 it was the saving of the day the emotions of all at sight of ihe
 glittering uniforms may be imagined

 a great ahoul of triumph went ip a yell of dismay came from
 the cowboys

 then followed the rattling of ateel and the flash of sabre blades
 before that charge what force could stand

 backward the followers of artemus cliff were forced

 in vain ihe villain tried to rally them they would not respond

 the odda were too great nnd they broke and fled in wild con-
 fusion the next moment pomp dashed up the incline and dropped
 from his horbe almost al frank reade jra feel

  lireas de lor marse frank he cried ecstaically yo am
 alihe an well an dls nisiger hab brought yo a rescue uftali all
 praps yo torgib me fo leabin de steam man when i hadnt ought

  yoii are forgiven pomp tried frank lightly  i might have
 done the same thing myself  am glad uo harm came lo you i had
 given you up

 deed no marse frank cried ihe delighted darky  i is too
 bad fo to die hi dar iish i is glad to see you

  well if il aint the nnygur cried barney with a wild msh at
 pomp  whurroo its glad i am to see yez onct more alive an well
 bejabers thats so

 the two jpienda embraced warmly then colonel clark rode up
 and saluted ail

  il beems that youve been having a bit of a sqnall here he de-
 clared  but at any rate youve vanquished the enemy

  with your timely assistance replied frank  but i believe we
 are not strangers colonel

  frank reade jr the inventor cried clark springing from tho
 saddle and seizing franks hand  wall now im glad lo see you
 but come lo think of it your colored man mentioned tho name of
 frank reade but i never dreamed that it was you 

  il is nobody else replied frank with a laugh  and i woll re-
 member you

  and i do you replied clark  i was once one of an army com-
 mission lo visit you and make you an offer for one of your inventions
 on a gui

  you are right

  you would not sell it

  no repliod frank  i do not care to sell any of my inventions
 they are for my own use i will always however pnt them al the
 disposal of the weal nnd oppressed

  truly a noble sentiment agreed the colonel  but  am anxious
 to capture this mail cliff hello whal have you there a giant in
 iron one of your now inventions is il well that beats nil

 with this clark proceeded to make an inspection of the steam man
 a greal crowd of the newcomers were dofh tbe same

 il was an object of great wonderment frank showed its working
 to the entertainment of all

 bui clills men had uot been so easily beaten as the savages

 they had dispersed into the passes and were somewhat scattered
 but here they made a stand and resisted stubbornly

 it was necessary to dislodge lliom as quickly ns possible

 al any moment they might avail themselvus of the fortuoea of war
 and turn victory into defeat

 so clark quickly called bis men together

 only a brief resl was all lhal he would accord lliem

 the bugle sounded boots and saddles and every man was
 quickly mounted

 a plan was quickly outlined between frank reade jr and col
 clark


frank reade jr and his new steam man

  this was tliat the cavalry should pursue aud thoroughly rout tbe
  cowboys even going down to ranch v to effect its destruction

  the vigilants were to return home and the cavalry would see to the
  punishment of arlemas clill

  but the steam man was to remain at a point below until the return
  of the cavalry

  if possible cliff was to be captured alive and a confession wrung
  from iiis lips

  this plan had been agreed upon

  the vigilants were nol wholly satisfied yet didnot demur

  clark and his command dashed away into the mills

  the vigilants and the sleam man started lor the open prairie

  this division of forces very spoil proved lo be au unwise and un-
  fortunate thing

  tbe fortunes of war are proverbial for changes

  strongly intrenched in tbe hills cliffs gang gave the soldiers a
  disastrous baltie

  in vuin the plucky young colonel tried to dislodge them

  they fonghl like tigers and having tlio advantage of location ac-
  tually decimated the cavalry one half in number

  until nightfall co clark kept persistently waging the battle
  then lie begau to think of retreat

  but to bis horror he found that this was by no means as easy a
  mutter as he had fancied

  the foe had actually closed in upon him and nearly every avenue
  of retreat was closed

  he was literally surrounded by the foe

   my soul he muttered in deep surprise  this is not very good
  generalship on my part

  what was lo be doner

  it was plainly impossible to dislodge llie foe

  the little baud of cavalrymen were now hardly adequate to cope
  with the foe in their front

  il really seemed as if cliff had received reinforcements tbe
  number of his bam had in some mysterious manner beeu increased
  darkness was coming on rapidly

  something must be done and at once col clark racked his brain

  for an expedient

  certainly they must extricate themselves from this position and
  without delay men were falling every moment about them and the
  enemys line like a cordon of death was every moment drawing
  tighter about them

  cold sweat broke out upon the intrepid colonels brow

  my god lie muttered  what is to be done

   it was a terrible question they were literally in a trap of death

  cliff was aware of ibis aud his men mads tlio air hideous with their
  yells closer they crowded the line

  in this extremity clark regretted having separated himself from the
  vigilants and the sleam man

  but this error had been made and it was too late to correct it

  rut the brave colonel was n t long without an expedient

  ii-	called out one of ids pluckiest privates and said

  jason do you want to undertake a ticklish job

   im ready mr replied he private with a salute

   you know we are in a light box

   yes sir

   we must bave reinforcements or the enemy will surely get ihe
  best of us

   it looks that war sir

  now i want you to try to get through the enemys line look
  for the vigilants and tho sieam man and tell them to come to our
  ntd then ride to the fort as fast as you can for a fresh squad tell
  the officer in charge to send two hundred mouuted men

   vary well air

   do you think you can do this

   i will do it or i will not come back

  clark knew that jason meant just what he said

  a few moments later tlio courier for relief slipped carefully into the
  shadows and wan gone

  a prayer trembled on clarks lips

  i	dont care lor myself lie mattered  but i cannot bear to see
  my brave buys slaughtered like sheep

  darkness now thickly settled down of course no lighting could be
  lioue until the break of day

   but the cavalrymen were not in a position to guarantee them much

  few of them dared to sleep and then it was upon their arms

  as the night hours dragged by clark paced the ground upon the
  outskirts of llie camp and listened for some sign of ihe return of jason

  he know that it was nol possible for the faithful courier to return
  from the fort under two days

  bui if the cavalry division was reinforced by the vigilants and the
  steam man ihey might bn able to keep the foe at bay until ihe fresh
  squad should arrive

  thus the plticky young colonel duns to hope

  t ime parsed it seemed an age to clark before a silent shadowy
  lorm slipped out of the gloom and into the camp

  as il drew nearer he recognized the courier jason

  	well my man lie said sharply you are back

  jason saluted quickly

  where are the reinforcements

   i did not liud them

   but-did  not teil you lo bud them began tbe colonel angrily

   easy colonel said jason respectfully  i think i have done 
  better thing sir

  what do you mean

   its a good ways to the fort you might be cut to pieces before i
  could return i have found an avenue by which i think we can es-
  cape

  clarks manner changed instantly

  you dont mean il be exclaimed excitedly  what is il

  jason drew nearer and lowered his voice in a mysterious manner

  just over that pile of bowlders lie whispered  i luund a nar-
  row passage through the mountain side il is almost a cavern
  for the lop is so closely overhung with bushes its a close squeeze
  for the horses but i think we can ail get through aud out upon the
  prairie before daybreak

  col clark was intensely excited

 good for you jason he cried in a joyful manner arouse
 the camp but do it quietly pul every man iu his saddle within
 ton minutes you have solved our salvation and you shall be pro-
 moted

  jason hurried away lo tiu ic bidding of the colonel

  in a brief space of time the camp was aroused

  the weary soldiers worn oul with lighting were only too glad to
  learn of the possibility of an escape

 at once preparations were made to steal a march upon the enemy

 the passage described by jason was found it was necessary to
 first pry aside a huge bowlder before passage could be made

 into the passage tbe little band went and one by one filed out
 into the valley beyond

 so skillfully was ihe move executed that the foe never dreamed
 of it daybreak came aim clill was furious to lind ihnl his intended
 victims had given him the slip during the night

 the cavalrymen had reached llie prairie in safety and galloped
 away from the hills

 clark knew that his only ard best move now was to return to the
 fort for reinforcements

 he could not hope to do anything with the foe with such a mere
 handful of men

  accordingly just as the sun appeared above the horizon the little
  cavalcade with its shattered ranks galloped away across tbe plain

  no effort was made to search for the vigilants

  clark knew hint even wilii iheir aid il would not be feasible lo give
  battle to the cowboys

 clearly it was necessary lo havo two hundred more men the
 colonel set his lips vengefully

  i will teach that desperado a lesson he muttered  he shall be
  swept out of existence together with bis rnscully crew aud before an-
  other week

  oa over ihe prairie they galloped toward the fort

  and as they rode thrilling adventures were the lot of frank reade
  jr and his friends on board the steam man

  let us therefore for a time deviate here and follow their fortunes

chapter xiii

the abduction

 chief harmon of the vigilants was not wholly content to abandon
 the trail of the cowboys just here

 he indulged in quite an argument with frank reade jr

  nis remarks were not without logic

   why only look at the senso m ihe tiling he declared  it is by
  no means possible that the soldiers are going to have an easy tiire
  with clilf and his men they may turn the tables on them yet i tell
  you it was a premature thing for that colonel to do to set us adrift so
  quickly

   yet be onglit to know his own strength said frank

  i dont believe he does

   i cannot but feel that he is doing the right thing

   i dont feel hint way

   well in case of defeat the stigma will not fall upon you

  all but that is not the idea we must not let cliff defeat them
  if lie doe he will defeat us

  what do you propose

  i am not going back home yet we will make a camp down here
 on willow creek when we learn for a fact that clifl has been done
 up then we will go home until then we are on duty

 frank saw lhat hamon was right he extended his hand and
 said

   i agree with yon

  i knew ye would replied tbe vigilant leader we can do this
 upon our own responsibility you are lo wail for clark at a point
 below here i believe

   yes

 very good that point is on willow creek we will accompany
 you there

  it was nightfall before willow creek was reached

 in a convenient spot camp was made the darkness became most
 intense in the vicinity

 camp-fires were made and guards posted

  the fires in the furnace of i lie steam man were banked and the oc-
  counants descended and mixedwith llie vigilants

 the men gathered around the fires and told stories and cracked
 jokes

  waller barrows the young vigilant who was so deeply in love with
  ressie rodman bad waited upon her at the wagon step and together
  they took a lover-like walk down the bank of the creek
frank reade jr and iiis mew steam man	

 nobody saw ihem go and it is doubtful it any one would have
 sought lo reairaiu them

 bul they were commuting unwittingly an act of great risk and tolly

 fur unknown lo any in ihe camp u coterie of dusky savages lurked
 in the lull prairie grass about

 barney and pomp were entertaining the camp with bome of their
 munchauseu stories

 tlio plainsmen roared with laughter until their sides ached

 boih were comical mokes and were continually playing roots upon
 each oilier barney had just worked a gag upon pomp wheu sud-
 denly the distant crack of a pistol was heard

 instantly every man in llie camp was upon his feet

 the most intense of excitement reigued all was confusion

 then one of llie guards came rushing iu

  theres a hull lot of apaches down yonder lie cried  tlier grass
 is full of em and i reckon theyve surrounded the camp

 steady all thundered harmon the vigilant leader  who tired
 lhat pistol shot

  i uoui know replied the guard

  is anybody outside the line

  yes

  who

 walter barrows and ihe young lady passed me not au hour ago
 they went  down the creek

  my soul gasped ilarmon wilh white face  tlial was barrows
 pistol without doubt he an the gal have certainly fallen into llie
 grip of llier injuns we must make lively work to save em

 frank reade jr bad listened  this report with a seusalion of hor-
 ror

 barney and pomp had at once desisted in i heir fun-making and
 barney proceeded to open the sleam mans furnace

 the crack of rifles now sounded all around the camp

 the savages without doubt were drawing their line closer and
 meant if possible to exterminate ihe little baud of vigilauls

 but a hue of dofenee was then thrown out aud the skulking savages
 were held al bay

 bul a desultory and very unsatisfactory species of warfare was kept
 up iu ihe darkuess

 ii	was impossible to tell how to move or where

 the enemy tired from all directions and practically at random

 many of the vigilauts were wounded and captain harmou was
 angry

 confound an injun he muttered in disgust-  they have sich a
 sneakin way of lighting they alius attack one ufter dark au haint
 goi ihe pluck to come out in the open an tight

 everybody was bound  acknowledge the logic of thl

 but llie savages kept up the same mode of attack uulll frank reade
 jr  adea diversion

 baruey had succeeded iu getting up steam once more in ihe steam
 man and now frank reade jr approached harmon

 give me live men he declared aud i will whip the foe for
 you

 five men gasped harmon why theyre ten to one out
 there

 iii	dont care if they are

  but-

  will yon give me the men

  oli yes but-

  theres no lime for questions captain ilarmou leave it all to
 me

 allright mr reade

 by harmons orders live of ttevlgilants joined frank reade

 he led them aboard llie steam wagon tlien lie closed ihe door
 and seized the reins which connected with ihe throttle

 tle sleam man gave a shriek loud enough to perforate the ear
 drums of any one in the vicinity

 then ll dashed out upon the prairie

 the etlecl may be imagined

 tlio monster with fiery eyes and all flame and smoke wilh clanking
 thunderous iread plunging inlo the midst of the foe was an appari-
 tion well to be feared

 right into the midst of the savages the steam man ran

 while llie armed men in ihe screened wagon poured destruclive
 volleys into the midst of the red foe

 pen cannot adequately describe the situation

 for a moment the apaches held their ground then wilh wild
 battled yells they fled before the conqueror

 in less than twenty minates the vicinity had been practically cleared
 of savages

 they retreated to a point below where their ponies were corralled

 mounting they dashed away to the westward the steam man
 pursued unlil finding a creek they escaped for good

 then the steam mun returned lo camp

 bul although the foe had been repulsed matters were still had
 enough

 waller barrows and bessie rodman wore missing

 that they were captives was a forlorn hope that they had been
 murdered was a dreadful fear

 delay was almost fatal in this case without loss of lime a good
 trailer was put upon the irail of the lovers

 daylight was breakiug in ihe east and this enabled him to easily
 follow the trail

 along ihe banks of the creek ll ran for nearly a fifth of a mite

 tteu the trailer paused

 here without doubl was the spot where burrows had been attacked
 by the apaches

  there wore footprints and marks of a struggle a rifle wilh broken
  stock was picked up

  il is barrowsgun said one of the vigilants

  blood was fouud upon llie ground bul  trace of tlio bodies

  they have been taken away as captives declared harmon posi-
 tively  there is no doubl of that

   or thrown into the creck suggested one of the vigilants

  investigation for a niomenl gave the pursuers a ibrlll of horror

 there were footprints down lo the waters edge aud the murks of
 some heavy body dragged thither

  in the shallow water protected by reeds was a body

 for u moment all expected to recognize barrows bul all drew a
 breath of relief

 it was not him

 the body was that of one of ihe apaches doubtless it was one
 shot by burrows and his body had been thrown inlo this place lo es-
 cape ihe notice of the white pursuers

 thats an injun irick declared harmon positively im
 mighty well satisfied that the captives are alive

    hope you are right said one man

   ditto said another

   then let us lake llie trail cried frank reade jr  if possible
  we must rescue them

 the question was settled at once all sprung to saddle and the
 trull which was quite plain was followed

  across the prairies went theisieom mun with the vigilants behind

 of course their horses could not compete wilh the man on a level
 stretch but frank did noliry to run away from them

  the indians bore away to u southwesterly course und soon a range
  of hills became visible above the horizon

 ilarmou made them out as the black bear ranee

  if they gel into lliose hills with llie captives he declared  well
  have mighty hard work dlggiu em out

  why asked one of his men

 bekase theres more holes and out of the way dens there llian
 you could sliitke a stick al

  burney and lompcrouched down iu the wagon and kept their rifles
  in readiness for business

 frank reade jr watched the plain ahead with eager eye hut
 though the trail was plain there was yet no signs of overtaking tba
 red foe

  ab they drew nearer the hills it became almost a certainty that ihe
  savages had sought refuge there

  a long stretch of plain intervened to the hills

 this was easily  be inspected with a glass and frank did o
 there was  sign whatever of the indians

  all hope was ihusgiveuup of overtaking llie redskins before reach-
  ing the hills

 il	seemed a certainty that they had reached their caves and the
 only alternative left was lo scour them thoroughly

 but when quite near an entrance between high tills suddenly the
 pursuers topped a rise in the prairie and were rewarded with u start-
 ling sight

  just below in a depression was the band of savages seemingly en-
  gaged in making camp

  a small creek ran through this depression

 as is well known indians alwujs encamp npon the banks of a
 stream vet it was a surprise lo the pursuers that they should ven-
 ture to camp in this open spol

  at sight of their foes the astonished redskins were thrown iuto a
  tumult

  instantly n mad retreat was begun for tle mountains

  a wild cheer pealed troin ihe lips of the vigilants

  harman settled himself in his saddle and shouted

 forward alll charge

  with a yell the vigilauts put spurs to their horses anil made for the
  imliun encampment

 frank reade jr started the steam man on a circuit to head off
 the savages

  but as he did so poinp clutched his arm

   hi dar marse frank cried the darky docs vo see dat little
  party oiier dur making fo de hills

 frank did see them

   yes he replied

   well dut am missy bessie nn her lover jes as euah as yo am
  bon marse frank an dar am half a dozen injuns jes holding onto de
  bridles ob dor bosses  makes it out sah dal dey but dey kiu reach
  de hills afo de steam man suh

  by jupiter youre righl pomp cried frank with inspiration
   but well try and spoil that little game

   dats right marse frank cried the darkey i jes fink de man
  kin obertakedem bosses snali ennlt

  frank seized the reins and pulled open the throttle

 as the sleam man went forward with his mighty stride frank
 opened the whistle valve and let out a mighty shriek of such loudness
 that the echoes were repealed a hundred fold in the recesses of ihe
 hills

chapter xiv

in hot pursuit

 tiie party of savages with the two captives in their midst evi-


frank reade jr and his new steam man

  denily intended to reach ibe hills if possible before being overtaken
  by the steam man

  at first frank had fancied it easy to cut tiiem off

  but there were several depressions in the prairie which the man imd

  lo	circait aud tlie distance was greater than frank hnd really
  dreamed of	

  like a runaway locomotive tho steam man raced over the plain

  the yigllauts were having a running light with the savages

  but frank reade jr waa doomed to disappointment

  me failed to cut off the band of abductors and they vanished from
  bight iu a deep pass

  it was too rocky a trail for tho steam man lo follow thus far the
  villains had the best of it

  golly sake marse frank cried pomp dey done git away wlf
  dem prisoners fo euah

   il looks ilka it agreed frank in a baffled tone  but there
  ought to be some way to cut them off

  begorra theres only won way declared buraev

   what is that

   let the nuygur sihay with ihe man anyou ani will go aftlier
  ihe dlvils a-foot said the oil

  for a moment frank entertained no bopeb of the success of such a
  plan

  then lie glanced back to the prairie where the vigilants nnd the
  indians were having their battle

  it was nip nnd luck between them but frank saw that the vlgilauts
  were fast getting the best of it

  not more than half a dnzari of thesavagea had the captives in charge
  to bo sure the oilcis were three to one yet frank believed llml with
  the plucky barneys help they could defeat them

  to think with frank reade jr was to act
  lie did not waste time but seizing a rifle cried

  	your idea li a good one barney we will act upon it pomp keep
  a sharp eye out for danger untill we return

  arighl marse frank replied the faithful darky

  barney delighted lhat frank had seen fit lo adopt ins plan was
  quickly ready and they left tho wagon

  the iu llans lo be sure had the start of them but the pass was
  rocky and it was hardly likely that they would succeed in gelling a
  groat lead

  swituy the two rescuers pressed forward

  they climbed over piles of bowlders crept through narrow led les
  anti climbed high steeps

  it seemed llml progress must be slow for the pouies of the indians
  and they should he overtaken before long

  suddenly barney paused with a sharp cry

  he seized frank by the arm and pulled him back into the cover of
  an angle in the mountain wall

  he was none too soon

  the crack of rifles smote upon tho air and the shower of bullets came
  down into the pass 

   bejabbera i saw the spalpeens just in the nick av time- declared
  barney peering around the edge of tb cliff wall  av  hadnt wed
  huve been dead gossoons as sure as me name is barney

   youre right there cried frank slipping extra cartridges into
  his ride  that was a close cull

   indade it wns

   i had no idea wo were so near the rascals

   bejabers  didnt mesilf-till i see ihe top-knot av wan of thim
  over llml ridge jeniler

   they are ready for us then

   bejabers and were ready too if i iver get a bead on any wan
  av them therell be a job for the coronerbad cess to thim

   where are they i cant see their position very well

  aisy mist her frank snid barney theyre hiding up yonder
  jisl fernmsl that big scrub av an oak on the edge of the cliff

  frank looked iu that direction suddenly barney gave a sharp
  cry

   whurro he yelled

  quick as a flash hs rifle went to his shoulder

  crack

  a veil of agony rang through the gorge then down over the cliff
  tumbled an indian almost at ihe cells feet

  tbe bullet had pierced his skull and his final account was settled

   good shot barney  cried frank  lhat only leaves live for us to
  tackle

  then quick as a flash the young inventor threw his rllle to his
  shoulder

  crnckl

  amiher yell a death cry went up on the air of the defile

   bejabers thala only four av the divils left chuckled barney
  it s only two to wan misther frauk

   youre right barney cried frank with enthusiasm  but the
  odds are yet too great

  the outlook now was certainly encouraging for the rescue of the
  prisoners

  but the two rescuers knew better than to essay an open attack

  the indian method of warfare was in this case far the best they
  remained strictly under cover

  all was quiei on tho bluff above

  but ii was not by any means likely that the foe were inactive

  the great danger now was that they would continue to slip away
  deeper into the hills ami reach some inaccessible hiding place

  our rebcuers waited as long as seemed consistent with safety

 then frauk said

   i think wed better make a break barney

   all roight sorr replied the celt  do yez think it safer
   we musi use cauiiou il may be possible lhat they are trying to
  draw us from our hiding place

   so i thought sorr

   again they may be far into the hills by this time we will gain
  nothing by staying here

   all roight sorr

  barney began to scan the side of the cliff a path was not visible
  anywhere yet the cell did nol believe li impossible to climb to the
  top

  if this could be done they might then succeed in getting upou level
  ground with the foe and escape the risk of their bullets

  frank deviued barneys purpose and said

  i think we can climb it burney

  bejabers well ihry

  barney had just got his hands and feet into niches in the cliff when
  a starlllng sound came up ihe pass

 hark

   what is it

  the tramp of ponies feet could be heard and the distant baffled
  yells of savages were wafied up oil the breeze

 the indians are coming up the pass cried frank with dismay
 barney theres not an instant to lose

  begorra yez are roight cried the celt beginning to make his
  way up the cliff

  it was a smart climb up the steep wall but it was safely mads at
  length

  they were now on level ground with the four captors but a care-
  ful reconnoitering of the vicinity showed that they had left

  in the lull in the conflict they had slipped away into the hills

  but barney took the trail and they went forward again in pursuit
  the sounds of the the foo coming up the pass iu their rear however
  every moment became plainer

  but fortunately just at a point where the trail diverged deeper into
  the hills the foe must have turned in another direction for very soon
  the sounds died out

   we huve nolliing to fear from them crlod frank with a breath
  of relief they have gone in another direction

 very soon ihe hills began lo merge into a deep valley through
 this ihere ran a swift stream

 as frank and barney entered the valley barney shouted

   be me sowl ihere be the spalpeens now

  where asked frank

   jisl down there ferniusi that grove of trees misther frank
  sure enough

 the four savages ond their captors were plainly seen on the
 banks of the creek

  they were just in ibe act of embarking in a canoe

  frank saw that be mnst act quick if he would prevent this

  so he said sharply

  go to ihe right barney i will go to the left and we must head
  them off

   all right sorr

 away went barney on the mad rnn tho savages had already got
 the canoe inlo she water

  they saw him coming and a yell wns the signal the captives were
  hustled into the light craft and il wan pushed out from tbe shore

  down into the current it went there was no lime lo lose

  frank reade jr came to a stop and raised his rille it was a des-
  perate chance but lie took it

 a quick aim a bead skillfully drawn on one of tbe paddlers

 and--

  crack

 a wild indian yell went up nnd the prow of the canoe swung
 around

 over into the water went tho doomed savage the bot had been a
 gohd one

  but the canoe was at the moment at the head of some swif rapids
  the next momenl it was racing down them aud turuiug a bend in
  the stream vanished from view

  frauk had not time to draw another bead before it wns out of sight
  and when it reached the lower level and came into view again it was
  out of range

 barney came along now and shouted

   be jabers yez did well misther frank that was a beautiful shot
  theres only three av ther red divils left

  this was true but the three savages seemed likely to elude their
  pursnera after all

  the canoe was racing dowu the stream and fast nearing a defile in
  the hills

  if it should enter this there was little doubt but that tbe fugitives
  would mnke their escape

  frank and barney saw this in the same moment

   begorra misther frank we must cut the divils off cried the celt
  forward then cried frank  is there nol a short cut

  both looked for this in the sarao instant they espied it

  the creek took a iong turn and by cutting directly across a mead-
  ow the two pursuers saw lhat they would be likely to cut off the sav-
  ages

  accordingly they started forward on the run

  the indian captors saw their move at once and an angry yell went
  up from them
frank readio jr and

 one cl them rose iu the canoe ami took quick aim and fired

 the bullet whistled close to barneys ear the cell slopped and
 cocked ills rifle

 	be jabers ill spoil that fellow he cried have at yez ye
 blatherskite

 barneye rifle spoke

 bui the motion of hie canoe very likely destroyed ihe aim or the
 bullet did uot lake effect

 at this point the canoe took a swift course and in the twinkling
 o un eye seemed  have overcome llie skilled hand al llie paddles

 in aliash it went over aud the entire parly were dumped into llie
 waters of llie creek

 a great cry went up from frank reade jr

 my god they will ue drowned

 forward the brave young inventor rushed he thought of poor
 bariowa wilh his hands tied

 thrown inlo the waters of the creek il did not seem os if any power
 on earth coulil save him

 bat two of the savages had seized ihe prisoners the canoe hail
 overturned in close proximity to the shore

 the third savage gave assistance and as the waler did not chauce
 to be deep all got ashore

 now we have them cried frank confidently

 but bis statement was premature

 even us it seemed tbal llie rescue was certain an incident occurred
 to prevent

 frum behind a small hillock appeared red bears gang of apaches
 full ball a hundred stroug

chapter xv

the vigilantes to the kescie

 the appearance of the savages was mot inopportune

 mounted on iheir fleet ponies wilh wild yells lliey swept down
 upon the party

 the three indian capt-ors yelled wilh delight

 frank and barney of course caine lo a halt of course it was folly

  lo	tempt fate

 to attempt lo stand against lhal gang was folly

 by jupiter gasped the young inveulor  ils all up with us
 barney we are badly benten

 tare an ounds grumbled the angry celt  that beats all me
 wolfesrelations phwativer shall we do now mistlier frank

 beat a relreat declared ihe young inventor  come on
 barney

  ils mesill as hales to retreat said barney stubbornly  oh if
 ne only hid llie steam man anthe naygur here uow wed moiglity
 soon turn the thing abouu

 the iwo rescuers now turned about aud haslily beat a retreal
 across the valley

 bul they hud nol goue far when the ludians beget lo ford ihe
 creek for llie purpose of giving pursuit

 barney saw the move and called franks attention to it

 be mo sow mistlier frank- cried the irishman excitedly
 weve gol to make quick loiuie or lhey have our scalps

  you are right barney

 but at that moment frank reade jr lifted iiis gaze and a mighty
 cry escaped his lips

 directly in from of them a body of armed men swept into llie val-
 ley

 they were the vigilants and at their head rode harmon at sight
 of frank and baruey liiey urged their horses on fasler wilh a loud
 cheer

 this was answered by the two fugitives wittr a will

 the savages seeing ihe vigilants now changed their tactics they
 turned their horses about and rode swiftly on the back trail

 frank could liardly wait for harmon and hia men to come up

 enthusiastic greetings were exchanged and also experiences

 the vigilants had driven the apaches before them into the hills

 but upon entering the fastnesses with which they were uot famil-
 iar the indians had given them the slip

 in the search they had come upon iho scene at an opportune mo-
 ment	

 there seemed no better thing to do than to give pursuit to the sav-
 ages at once

 accordingly a couple of spare horses were provided for frauk and
 barney and they rode forward on the charge

 the delay had been brief but it had enabled the savages to cross
 the creek and start for the defile beyond

 down thundered ihe vigilants in hot parsnit

 the creek was quickly forded and the pursuers seemed to be gain-
 ing at every bouud

 but of a sudden the savages executed a peculiar and inexplicablo
 maneuver

 suddenly and without warning they split in two sections one going

  lo	the right and llie other to the left

 in one division was the girl captive bessie rodman and in ihe
 other walter barrows

 the party who had the girl in charge started for the defile

 the oilier made directly across the valley in a flash of time the
 purpose of the savages was made apparent

 the vigilants could not go both ways with splitting up

 as they were much less in numoer than the apaches the result of
 this would be to greatly weaken them i not actually place their al
 the nurcy of the red foe

his new steam man	 

 on the other hand it was a problem aa to which direction to pursue
 or which party to follow

 harmon drew a blight rein upon his horse aud wavered a moment

 tlio vigiluuls nalurnlly were inclined to go to the rescue of their
 comrade but frauk reade jr comprehending the folly of ibis
 cried

  the girl first we can rescue the man later

  yes cried harmon in a voice of thunder that is ourdutv
 the girl first boys then we will try and save burrows

 the vigilants cheered and away thundered the trdop toward ihe
 defile

 a tew moments huer they reached it and entered i

 high walls of black forbidding rock arose on either side to a mighty
 height the bed of the defile was rough and slrewu wilh bowlders

 it was harder for the liorbos of ihe vigilants to pick iheir way
 through here than the lleet-footed ponies of the uvages

 accordingly the indiansgained qnite a lead but after a quarter
 of a mile of the defile had been traversed the vigilants were brought
 to a hall in an unceremonious manner

 the ilelile seemed suddenly to take an upward trend here and high
 piles of bowlders made a barrier of some height

 suddenly from behind this barrier tifere came the flash of rifle muz-
 zles and a volley of bullets came ratlling down through hi- deli if

 two of llie vigilanls were wounded and hannon lustantly called a
 halt

 cover was quickly sought behind rocks and corners near

 il	was ovidenl that the indians had here made a stand the vlg
 ilant leader was puzzled

 but suddenly frank reade jr gave a sharp cry

 listen

 his acute ear had caught the sound of horses hoofs coming up the
 delile in their rear

  by thunder ejaculated harmon with sudden terrible compre-
 hension  wo tre trapped-

 the men gazed blankly at each oilier

 nothing was more apparent the apache under tho shrewd red
 bear hail certainly very cleverly outgeneraled them

 led into the defile by one division ol the apaches the other bad
 proceeded to block up the ontlel and thus iilerally the vigilants
 were in a trap

 there was not the advantage in facing a foe iu this manner lhat
 there was in having him wholly in the front

 to be attacked boih front and rear would demoralize oven the
 largest and bravest of armies harmon was completely taken aback

  wall i swan he exclaimed with earnestness  i never believed
 an injun could beat me in any bucii way as that bul wo are in for
 il boys nnd no mistake weve got to light imrd

 the savages in front were keeping up a raking lire

 those in the rear had now drawn near enough to also openflrc
 the fun had begun

 but llie brave band of white men had no thought of fear or of re-
 treat

 they at once by harmons direction sought safe places of cover
 and proceeded to return the lire

 every lime an indians lop-knot showed above the fringe of rocks
 it wns made a target of

 thus the battle was kepi up for over an hour

 then an idea occurred lojtlie inventive mind of frank reade jr

 he had carefully examined the face of the pass in doln- c ta ina
 discovered what looked like a feasible fool path over the clitl

 al once he called harmon aside nnd explained a plan lo him

  i think we can defeat the savages easily in this manner he de-
 clared give me five men and i will guarantee a surprise for them

 mr reade lake what force you need declared me vigilant
 leader  i have full coulideuce in your ability lo do as you say may
 you succeed

 frank at once selected fivo men from from the troop

 -then wilh lsarney lie led the way cautiously up the path

 fortunately il was overhung with foliage to a large extent so that
 they were hidden from the view of those in their rear

 in a few moineuls a position near the brow of the cliff had been
 reached then franks surmise wns verified

 the little party could look down upon the heads of the savngeh it
 was an easy matter to pour a volley amongst them wilh mast demora-
 lizing effect

 frank sent one of the men back down the clifl to give harmon the
 cue when lo make acharg

 then a a favorable moment frank gave the order lo lire

 six repealing rdles were turned upon the savages nnd ns fast aa
 they could be worked they were engaged in firing a volley down upon
 the heads of the exposed savages

 the effecl was startling

 the savage is never the one to stand in open field and light al once
 a panic seized them

 il	was ihe moment for ihe charge and harmons men rushed for-
 ward

 up over the rocks lliey went in a twinkling the savages wero
 driven from their entrenchments and utterly routed and compleiely
 dispersed

 frank reade jr and barney saw their opportunity and rushed
 upon iwo of llie savages who had bessie rodman in charge

 in a moment the girl captive was free occe more aud among
 frieuus the iwo guarus lied for their lives
	frank reade jr and iiis new steam man

 all itiis had happened in a twinkling of an eye comparatively
 speaking bji tbe tight was not over

 tin force in the rear were coming to ihe attack

 but harmons men were now iu a position to command the defile
  iiiick sharp conflict ensued anil the apaches were driven back
 with great slaughter

 the vigilants hud thus far the best of ir

 the enemy had been routed and bessie rodman rescued

 only one other thing now remained lo he accomplished and tliis
 win liio rescue of waller barrows

 fiit even as ibe question was being discussed a loud cry arobe
 and the next moment a lialless blood-stained young man caine dash-
 ing down over the clill and fell half fainting in ihe midsl of the vigi-
 lants

 it was barrows

 in the midst of the tiglil the plucky young plainsman had succeed-
 ed in breaking his bonds aud afier a desperate light with two of bis
 captor had made liia escape

 everybody extended congratulations to llie young couple and then
 plans for the fulure were discussed

 it was not certain lhat ihe savages would not return to ihe attack

 but a report was brought in by a number o scouis sent out that
 the apaches had withdrawn from tiie held entirely

 it was therefore decided lo go back to willow creek

 it was not known whether col clark had been victorious with the
 cowboys or nor

 until this question was settled ilarmon had no idea of returning

 home

  until clitl and his gang have been wiped out of existence he
 declared i shall nol give up ther chase

 trunk and barney were anxious lo return at once to the sleam
 man and pomp

 they were by no means assured that the darky was safe or that he
 might not have sol into trouble

 accordingly llie start was at once made for the prairie

 down one of the defiles the vigilants rode coming out into the
 little valley they crossed this and entered the pass

 bul they had not proceeded a hundred yards into the pnss when one
 of llie advance scouis came rushing back and gave a thrilling report

 ther cowboys are coming up ther pass he cried  thars a
 host of em anil art clill is at the head of em

  tho cowboys gasped ilarmon

 the greatest excitement ensued

 my soul exclaimed frank reade jr in dismay clark has
 been defeated

  bail lack to the omailhounsi

  bui what of pompf exclaimed frank with alarm  barney we
 ought ul onco lo ascertain where he is

 to bo imre misther frank agreed the celt bat how in the
 name av all the saints are yez goiu to do it bejabers these cow-
 boys have got us cornered

 in u very few moments a largo sized batlle was in progress in the
 pass

chapter xvi

pomp makes action

 now let us return to pomp and the steam man whom ill the detail
 of hie thrilling adventures just chronicled we have neglected

 tho darkey entertained nothing like fear at being left alone on
 board llie steam men

 indeed he rather enjoyed ihe responsibility thus put npon him

 he could occasionally hear rifle shots from llie hills which assured
 him that frank aud barney were making it liol for the savages

  golly be muttered  i jes reckon dein injiues git de worslest
 ob dal baht ki dar if dey amnt coinin dis yer way i specs i bet-
 ter move

 thl was true

 the indians had heen driven before the vigilants and starting for
 the hills were coming straight toward the steam man

 it was evident that they meant to enter the hills ul this point

 pomp knew that it would be folly to remain where he was with the
 sleam man

 tlio savages might ruin the machine as he could not hope alone to
 holt ihein at bay

 so he opened ihe throttle ami started away with the man

  kepi in until satisfied that he had reached a safe point

 meanwhile tho indians reached the pass and entered it

 the vigilants however did not eeein in a hurry to pursue tliev
 remained on the batlle ground for some while looking after their dead
 and wounded

  hen they did start far the pass pomp had returned and was there

 stationed

 as they caine up the darky put his head out of the screen door aud

 shouted

 iiiod foyo marse harmon jes yogib dem injuns a good
 lickin fo luck i reckon vo kin do it

  i reckon we can pomp replied ilarmon  at least well try

  if yo sees marse frank jes tole him fo me dat his carriage am
 waitin to him will yot

 ilarmon replied that lie would and rode away laughing immoderately

 the vigilants all vanished up ihe pass ii seemed ages after they
 had gone when pomp received another greal surprise

 suddenly hearing the clatter of hoofs he turned his head anil scru-
 tinized tho prairie

 a thrilling sight met his gaze

 there coming over a swell in the plain wns a body of horsemen

 it required but a glance for llie darky lo recognize them

 they were the cowboys with artemus clil at iheir head they
 were nuiog directly down upon the steam man

  they were just coming from the scene of their victory over clark
 pomps eyes stuck oat like acutes and he sprung to his feet

 glory fogoodness he gasped  dat am clifl and bis debbils

 i	jes reckon i get out dere way

 in an instant he opened the throttle and let the steam man race
 out upon llie prairie

 the cowboys gave a wild yell and attempted pursuit

 but iliey could not keep anywhere near ihe man and finally aban-
 doned it with baffled yells they returned and disappeared iu the pass

 golly dat am a berry bad hug for marse frank an de cdere
 muttered pomp  dey will neber be anticipating de cornin ob dem
 rapscallions an dat will make lings berry bad indeed

 the darky al once began to wax anxious as to tbe fate of his friends

 he began to feel as if ii wns very much his duly to enter the hills
 and render what assisunce he could

 but what was lo be done with the steam man

 pomp reflected that he might take it with him if he could only find
 some way of doing so

 to attempt to traverse llie rocky pass was oul or the questiou

 the darky was in a quandary

 soon he iieard tbe sounds of firing the bntlle was on and at no
 great distance either

 pomp could hardly contain himself lie walked up and down in
 the cage like a prisoner in his cell

 ob cose i has marse franks ordalis to stay yere he mattered
 bui it am evident oat marse frank needs all de help dat he can get
 what ebber i kin do i jes don know what

 the darky sal down and began sober reflection

 he was a shrewd fellow and as a result he was not long inforinulac-
 ing a plan

 lie sprang up finally

 by golly ill jes do dal fing lie cried finally  it am de bos
 fing i kin do

 he opened tho throttle and started ihe steam man along the base
 of llie hills with keen eye he studied the possibility of entering
 lliem

 by llie pass it was impossible but he imagined that it would not
 be difficult to find another means

 nor was he disappoinied

 at a certain point the hillside was shorn o trees and bowlders it
 made a smooth surface even over the brow of the height

 as the steam man was provided with power to climb any height of
 this sort pomp at once sel his course up llie height

 up wenl the steam man with prodigious strides

 nearer ihe lop he drew pomp had no means of knowing whether
 it would be possible to go further or not

 bul his best hopes were realized upon reaching the summit

 down a gentle incline the steam man went and through a scattered
 grove of tree and came out mlo a valley deep iu the hills

 the sound of firing was now quite plain

 indeed as pomp guided ihe man down into the valley he saw the
 powder smoke of the conoict iu the pass just a short way up the val-
 ley

  by golly muttered the darky joyfully   reckon dat i get dar
 jes in de bes time wont marse frank be glad fo to see me

 bin al that moment a startling thing occurred

 the man was traveling slowly when just as the bottom of the in-
 cline was reached two powerful savages sprang out of the grass and
 seized the throttle rein

 pomp was so taken by surprise that for a moment he could not act

 the pulling of the rein closed the throttle and the man came to a
 halt

 pomp culd not use the rein to open it again and had there been
 more of llie red foe the sleam man would have been at their mercy

 bul there were only two of tuem and while ore held llie rein the
 other essayed to hack his way into the wagon with his tomahawk

 pomp acted with the rapidity of thought

 gway from dar yo red imp lie yelled picking up a revolver
 if you dont ill jes bore a hole in yo

 bui ihe red man did not desist and pomp springing to a loop-hole
 fired al him

 the bullet went true to ita aim and the indian fell dead

 the other savage seeing the tate of his companion let out a baffled
 yell and relaxing his grip on the valve rein lied precipitately

 pomp did nol lake tbe pains to fire at him hut coolly picked up tho
 valve rein opened the throttle and llie steam man weiu on

 straight for the scene of the conflict al the mouth of the pass pomp
 went

 when he came upon tho scene he found a thrilling and sanguine
 conflict in progress

 at sight of the steam man a cheer went up from the vigilants

 in a moment frank and barney were aboard and shaking hands
 with pomp

 the situation was auickly explained

  i thought mos likely yo would wanl de steam man marse frank
 said the faithful darky  so i jes fetched him ober lo yo

  you have done well pomp said frank joyfully  of course
frank reade jr and his new sleam man



 this insures our safety with he steam man we would easilv es-
 cape the cowboys but it will never do lo leave these brave vigil-
 ants to their mercy

  obcose not marse frank cried pomp seizing his riile jes

 o let dis cliilc draw a bead on dem rapscallions ill show dem dat
 onip kin use a rifle

 the steam man was placed in ibe van of the line of battle

 protected as they were by the impervious screen those on board
 could ire with advantage at the cowboys

 the battle was a hot one but every moment the cowboys slowly
 gained ground

 what was worse the ammunition of the vigilants seemed to be
 giving out

 with plenty of ammunitionit was possible that the vigilants
 could have held them at bay for a long while

 but of course when the ammunition should give out the battle
 would be ended

 white-faced but determined the brave plainsmen stood their
 ground

 not a man of them thought of retreat all were prepared to give
 nptbelr lives like heroes

 there seemed no way of getting out of their present desperate
 situation

 to retreat was about equal to an impossibility for it would be
 out upon the open plaiu where they would be shot down like
 sheep

 the situation was an awful one

  dura it i dont keer for myself said bluff harmon the vigilant
 leader  but some of the boys have families dependent  em ah
 that dog of a cliff has sins to answer fer

 you are right agreed frank reade jr  but there must be
 some wav of getting out of this scrape

 	howl

  ah that is a sticker there is uo hope of reinforcements near 

  none whatever

 the steam man could be sent for them in quick time if such a
 thing were possible

 but it is not the nearest place is ranch v and that is cliffs
 own den we know that

 certainly

  the fort is too far off there is just one forlorn hope

 ah

 the cavalry

 but they may have been all wiped out

  very true well we must die then like men but mr reade
 there is no reason why you should not take the girl in your steam
 man and make your escape

 frank placed a hand upon tho vigilant captains shoulder

 yes he said briefly i could do that

 then do it we will hold the foe at bay until-

 stop

 harmon looked his surprise

 youdo not know me said frank reade jr determinedly
 ilojou think i would desert you in this hour of need i

 neverl if you die so do we until the last the steam man will
 stand his ground

 with tears of emotion in his eyes harmon gripped franks hand

 god bless you was all he could say

 at this moment oneof the vigilants came up excitedly

  we are just firing tho last cartridges he declared  what
 shall we do  is it a retreat harmon 

 retreat cried the vigilant leader clubbing his rifle  never
 come on one and all the crisis has come now let us show them
 how brave men can die

 the cowboys with their wild cheers were forcing the crippled vig-
 ilants back

 but even in the moment of their victory a strange sound came
 from the rear and a mighty cry went up from the throats of the
 vigilants

 hurrah we are saved rescue has come at last

 i company

chahter xvii

once moke- in the enemys power

 it had been col clarks firm intention to return to the fort for re-
 inforcements

 it was a long ways but he did not reckon this lie thought only
 of securing a sufficient body of men to cope successfully with the
 cowboys

 so on they rode the little remnant of the squad for the far distant
 fort

 but after a night had been spent in camp just as the bugle called
 boots and saddles one of the guard sighted a body of horsemen
 just coming over a swell in the prairie

 the alarm was given and clark rode out to investigate

 one glance was enough and a cry of joy escaped his lips

  hurrahr he cried  weare in luck it is itomaines
 of one hundred men forward all i

 with cheers the little band rode out to meet the reinforcements

 the command had been sent out under captain romaine to search
 for clark and his men

 the two odicers shook hands and explanations were made

 you have come just in the nick of time romaine declared
 clark  ve can now return and whip the cowboys

  we are with you colonel declared the captain with a salute
  the boys are itching for some hot work

 well i will promise it to them laughed clark as he took com-
 mand

 at once the cavalry set out at full gallop for the hills

 it seemed like a strange fate that guided them almost to the vei -
 scene of the conflict

 the firing was heard long before the pass was reached ana clark
 hurried his men forward

 he at once threw them into the pass in the rear of cliffs gang

 it was an opportune moment too

 just as the hist cartridge of the vigilants was used the cavalrv
 struck the rear of the cowboy gang

 instantly a panic seized cliffs men thev made a brief stand
 aud then were driven up a side deille into thehills

 here they made a stubborn stand

 the cavalry literally cleared the pass aud riding through came
 into the midst of tbe vigilants

 thescene which followed baffles description

 in a moment clark and big hannon were shaking hands with the
 deepest emotion

  ye came jest in the nick of time clark declared the vigilant
 chief  in ten minutes more we might have all been dead men

  then weare in luck cried the colonel for which  am very
 glad ah mr reade  am glad to see you

  the same replied frank as he gripped hands with ihe colonel
 then clark rode away up the defile to see what was going on
 there

 he found the fiercest kind of a battle in progress the cowbovs
 had intrenched themselves once more ana were making a bold
 stand

 tho cavalry outnumbered them but they were in a verv advan-
 tageous position

 the best efforts of clarks men would not suffice todislodge them
 for a long while the sanguine battle went on

 in vain clark tried to eject them from their position his brav-
 est efforts met with failure

 the intrepid colonel knew that if he could get the foe into the
 open he could hope to whip them

 but as it was it looked certainly as if his plucky little band would
 be badly decimated in the accomplishment of the desired end

 in this quandary frank reade jr appeared upon the spot

 the young inventor had borrowed ahorse of one of the vigilants
 and rode up to see how the light was going on

 well colonel he said greeting clark how are vou making
 out

  not as well as i could desire replied the colonel in a dejected
 manner

  wliat is the matter

  why i cant drive the rascals

  why not 

 they have a position up there in the hills which is unassail-
 able

 i disagree with you said frank quietly  lam nota military
 engineer out i am a land surveyor and i tell you their position on
 that hill is not of the best

 clark was staggered

  why it is the best position about here he declared

  no said frank gravely  yonder is a much better position
 he pointed to a hill co the right and which the one upon which
 the cowboys were seemed to overlook

 what-try to command the foe from that hill f cried clark
 scornfully  we would only expose ourselves and they would
 sweep us from it like chaff before tne wind

  no they wouldnt

  now mr reade what is the use for you to tall that way  the
 hill upon which they are is higher than this one 

  it may be higher in the number of feet replied frank but
 not in advantage of position

  how do you make that out

  it is easy enough to see the top of this hill is smooth is it
 not 

  yes

  the top of theirs is craggy and they cannot climb up to it their
 position is far from the top a position on the top of yonder hill
 will easily look down into their camp

 ciark was surprised but he saw the logic of franks remark

  by love he cried  perhaps you are right

  i think you will find that i am

  but i would have taken my oath that they had the highest posi-
 tion around here

  well that would seem to be really so for tbo hill itself is
 higher yet it is but an optical delusion

 clark extended his hand to frank

  mr reade he cried warmly  you are right i acknowledge
 mv mistake perhaps your opportune suggest ion may enable us to
 whip the foe

  if it is of any value i am highly pleased said frank mod-

 s  feel that it is and i shall at once proceed to take the hill

 clark at once proceeded to do this by his command his men
 moved up the back side of the hill

 this protected them from the bullets of the cowboys

 arrived at the top of the smooth hill it was found that frank
 reade jr was right	

 they were enabled to look right down upon the cowboys in their
 position

  hurrah cried clark jubilantly that means victory

 a volley was given the astonished cowboys they returned with
 ill effect	 

 the tables were exactly turned upon them and they were not
 slow to see the point

 a red-hot fire was kept up for some little time but the cowboys no

longer held the advantage

 indeed it began to look muchly as if they were to be driven from
 their position

 suddenly all firing ceased

 the cowboy gang were not in sight nor did they tire another

 clark feared a stratagem or some fatal decoy and dared not at
 once order a charge

 but finally he became convinced that the cowboys had evacuated
 their position and had made a retreat

 flushed with victory clark ordered his men to charge


frank reade jr and his new steam man

 up tha siope they went with fixed bayonets bat when they
 cleared the top of the intrench ments hastily thrown up by the cow-
 boys it wns found that they had gone

 they had departed quite unceremoniously and completely

  not au article of any kind was left behind

 indeed it also became a mystery as to the course taken by them
 not a sign of a trail coula be found

  it baffled the cavalrymen

  	by jupiter exclaimed clark in disgust -how are you going to
  fight such a shadowy foe if they would only come out like men
  aud light it out it would be all right but they dont dare do it

 you would whip them said frank lieade jr with a laugh
 that is why they are playing hide aud seek

    suppose so but it makes it pretty hard for me i suppose the
  best course now is to send out scouts and scour the hills

   exactly

  all right i will do it

  i	hope you will succeed

   thank you i will do it or die

   that isa good resolution

  well i mean it every word of it

 with this clark ordered bis men to horse und the quest at once
 began

  frank did not believe that he could be of further service just now
  bo he decided to return to the steam man

 mounting liis horse he rode down through the defile in a few
 moments he reached the spot where the remnant of the brave vigi-
 lant band were

 there was the steam man intact but frank saw at a glance that
 something was wrong about the camp

 everybody appeared to bedeeply excited young barrows was
 seen wringing his hauds aud rushing about madly

 frank senthis horse forward rapidly	v

 burney saw him coming and ran out to meet him

   och lione misther frank he cried

  well exclaimed frank reining up his horse  what is the
 matter c	

   sure somethin terrible has happened since ye went away

  well what is it r

   shure sor the young lady bessie has gone sor an divilja wan
  av u-h kinfolnd her anywhere

  bessie hodman gone gasped frank  can that be possible

  shure sor it is anfaix they all do believe that the divils av
  cowboy ik- the orders av ar temus cliff have got her agin

   great heavens cried frank with horror  how on earth could
  they bav done that is there not enough of you here to prevent

   shure sor that is thrue enough cried liamey  but its the
  blmils fmiit hersilf as ivery wan believes

   her fault cried frank in surprise  how could that be

the lovers quest

   ill tell ye how it was mister reade cried bluff harmon the
  vigilant as he came up  ye see the gal took big chances thars
  a spring in that bit av bushes there an she went over to git a drink
  oj water nobody has seen her since

  have you made a good search asked frank sharply

   an all ilred good one

  hut how do vou know that cliffs gang have got her

  because we know that it could not lie injuns for the ground
 was marked with prints of the cowbovsshoes

  frank received tills information with sinking heart

 lie knew that it must be too true that besae hodman had again
 fallen into the hands of cliff

  it vhs a dismaying reflection

  to effect her rescue would prove no easy task

   list how to go to work to do it was a problem to frank

  but he was uot long in deciding upon a plan of action

 meanwhile young harrows desperate over the thought that his
 girl love was once more in cliffs power had made a daring move

  alone he rode away into the hills

 he was determined to rescue bessie or sacrifice his life in the
 attempt

 barrows was a youth of rare pluck and great determination

  in tills quest he was aided by his blind love for bessie rodman
  for her he would gladly give up his life

  striking into the hills lie sought to follow the trail of the ab-
  ductors

  but it was soon lost iu the tlinty ground and his best efforts to
  recover it were in vain

 however he kept on with feverish resolution it was now a
 blind quest but this did not deter him in the least

  soon barrows had penetrated deep into the hills

  he heard the distant sounds of firing and knew that the soldiers
  and cliffs men were yet having it out

  god give me strength to rescue bessie rodman he prayed as
 he rode on

 it bad occurred to barrows that the young girl might have been
 taken to ranch v by her captors

  he had half made up his mind to proceed thither when a thrilling
  thing occurred

  suddenly the sharp crack of a rifle smote upon the air

  barrows reeled in the saddle and bis horse gave a plunge

 a line of red blood trickled down over hia face the bullet had
 grazed bis cheek bone

  it was a narrow escape

  the fraction of an inch in another direction and the bullet might
  hare penetrated his brain	

 oung barrows had faced danger and death times enough to
 know quite well what to do

 lie instantly dropped from his horse aud spoko a word of com-
 mand to the animal

 the faithful and well-trained steed wheeled and galloped away
 into the cover of timber near

 barrows himself sank down behind a pile of rocks

  all this was done in the twinkling of an eye

 the trained westerner whose life is in danger knows well the
 value of quick action

  it was this which saved the life of barrows for half a dozen bul-
  lets came whistling down the mountain side tbe next moment

  he had run unconsciously upon his foes lie experienced a thrill
  ns it occurred to him that this was most likely the party who had
  bessie rodman in their charge

 heaven help me now be muttered fervently i must save
 her or die

  from his position he could safely scrutinize the mountain side

 he saw that far up on its side there was a rude cabin uiade of
 bark and logs

  from this the storm of bullets had come

  nothing could be seen of those within lhe cabin

 but barrows believed that uot only was the foe within but also
 bessie rodman

 he was somewhat at a loss now to know just what move to make

  to advance openly to the attack would have been an act of folly

 he would certainly have met his death in a summary fashion

 so while pondering on the subject he continued to watch the
 cabin windows

  he held his rifle in readiness for instant use

  suddenly a face appeared for an instant at one of the windows

 it was quickly withdrawn and barrows had not time lo tire he
 recognized it however as the face of one of the outlaws

 the young plainsmans nerves were steel and he watched his
 chance again with nervous anxiety

 suddenly the opportunity came once more the face appeared

  barrows raised liis rifle quick as thought

  crack

 a wild cry went up the sound of a falling body was heard and
 then the tramping of feet and bitter curses

  barrows knew that his shot had taken effect

 then he changed his position but not a sound or a sign of life
 came from the mysterious cabin

  ifthey are in the cabin they arc keeping mighty dark he mut-
  tered they surely must be there for i have not seen them come
  out as yet

  a great length of time had elapsed

  certainly an ho-ir aud a half of waiting had passed and barrows
  felt that he must do something and at once

 i shall die of worriment if  stay here ho muttered per-
 haps-

 he paused a thrilling thought had struck him

 it was more than likely that h had been waiting all this while
 for nothing

  it would have been not by any means a difficult matter for the foe
  to have slipped out by a rear exit und by this time be far from the
  spot

  but how was he to determine this fact

 it could only be done by approaching the hut boldly and search-
 ing it

  to do this was to incur the risk of a bullet from the outlaws

  this might be only a clever trick of theirs to draw him from his
  covert

 all these thoughts passed kaleidoscope like through barrows
 braiu

  he was satisfied that the foe could be but a half dozen in number

  if he could have kept up a desultory battle with them in his tires-
  ent position he believed that he could have picked off a number of
  them aud thus reducing their numbers eventually bring the tight
  to a focus with a fair chance of winning

 but the outlook now was by no means so prepossessing

 it was more than  cely that he would have great dltllculty in
 cutting off the abducf rs before they should join the main body ol
 the cowboys

  in this case it would be more difficult to rescue bessie rodman

  barrows now realized bis folly in starting out single handet to
  pursue the abductors

 if he had now several of his companions with him the hut could
 have been surrounded and there would have been little trouble in
 making the rescue

 but time was speeding and something had got to be done at once

 barrows proceeded to act

  he began to cautiously climb up the mountain side keeping in the
  cover of rocks and trees

 he was very careful not to expose himself to a shot and in this
 way had soon reached a point from which he believed he could see
 the rear end of the cabin

  there it stood lonely and silent

  was it really deserted or were the foe yet within its wails

  to all appearances it was deserted

 barrows hesitated a moment and then took tho desperate chance

 he emerged boldly from the woods and approached t he cabin

 on he went until within ten yards of the door yet there was no
 sign of life

 the next moment he reached tho door

  it yielded to his touch and lie entered the place was deserted

  there were evidences that the foe had been there

  also barrows made a thrilling discovery in the soft dirt of the
  floor ho discovered the footprints of bessie rodman

  at least it was safe to presume that they were hers for there was
  no likelihood that the region for many miles held another of her
  gentle sex

 feverishly barrows examined the trail and followed it out
 through a rear door of the cabin

  it led into a narrow gulch and up the mountain

  it was quickly lost in the gravelly soil but barrows kept on up
  tbe mountain

 he now censured himself for not having acted with greater dis-
 patch

 he believed that had he changed his position earlier he would
frank reade jr and his new steam man



 have become aware sooner of the change of base of the abductors

 this was undoubtedly true but on the other hand there had been
 the great risk of exposure to a bullet

 on the whole the lover felt that he had reason to be grateful for
 his success in so promptly striking the trail of the foe

 he kept on up the mountain with increasing hopes

 if he could once more overtake the abductors under more favor-
 able circumstances he believed that he could effect the rescue of
 bessie hodman

 he still kept on up the mountain

 then he suddenly halted at a point from which he had a good
 view of the country about

 he looked down upon a level plain below some distance which
 was fringed with trees

 in the verge of this timber line barrows saw a number of moving
 figures

 he was satisfied that they were the party of abductors and he even
 fancied he could ses the form of bessie rodman

 with deadly resolution barrows started in pursuit

 down the mountain he went and soon reached the level of the
 plain

  the party was now out of sight but barrows believed that he
 could overtake them

 so he set out at a rapid pace aloug the verge of the timber excit-
 ing experiences were in store for him

chapter xix

franks narrow escape

 frank reade jr had decided to go at once in quest of the ab-
 ductors of bessie rodman

 he called pomp and barney aboard the steam man and the start
 was made

 of course they were not aware that barrows had started out upon
 the same mission

 it was decided to proceed up the death gulch for frank fancied
 that the abductors had likely struck out over the mountain range

 the gulch could be traversed by the steam man easily and frank
 deemed it safer to travel that way

 up the gulch the steain man went

 for some distance all went well and no incident worthy of note
 occurred

 but finally a branch of the canyon was reached and here a halt
 was called

 this extended to the southward

 frank knew that the outlaws could not have crossed this without
 a wide detour

 the ground was high above the walls of the canyon and the
 young inventor decided upon a different move

 the steam man proceeded up this canyon for some ways

 then frank called a halt

  we will stop here  he said

  shure mistner frank cried barney  phwat iver do yez want
 o do that fer i its a clear course ahead

  i am well aware of that brney replied frank but i am not
 sure that we are following the right course

  indado sor

  i mean to climb to the top of the canyon wall here and take a
 look off at the country

  shure enough sor

  golly marse frrnk amnt yousc gwine to let dis chile go wif
 jot

  begorra not a bit av it cried barney  shure yez may stay
 wid the stheam man naygur

  yo glong iish i reckon marse frank take me dis time

 frank smiled and said 

  yes it is no more than fair pomp for you to go this time you
 will remain with tht man barney

 barney did not demur for he knew that it would be of no use

 but he had been with frank on excursions many times and per-
 haps felt that it was no more than fair that foinp should have this
 chance

 no time was lost

 armed with rifles and revolvers the two explorers left the steam
 uan

 a good path up the canyon wall was selected and after an ardu-
 ous climb they finally reached the summit

 from here a mighty view of the country about was obtained

 as far as the eye could reach to the east ward was the level expanse
 of plain

 in the other direction mountain peaks rose above them to a great
 altitude

 frank had a powerful glass and with this proceeded to scrutinize
 the country below

 but he could see nothing of the cowboys nor was he able to tell
 in what direction clarks men had gone

 he descried at once what he believed to be smoke ascending from
 behind distant trees and fancied that this might be from the guns
 of the military and the cowboys

 but of this lie was not sufficiently positive to venture to go thither

 well pomp he said dubiously as he closed the glass i
 dont see that we can locate the abductors of bessie rodman from
 here i declare i am befogged

 gollv marse frank cried pomp with dilated eyeballs what
 eber yotink we bettah do nowr

  i declare i dont know

 ise done reckon dat de cowboys hab gone back to dat ranch ob
 deres wid dat lily gal

 frank gave a start

 itbad not before occurred to him that the abductors might have
 taken their captive to ranch v

 indeed so strongly did he become impressed with the possibility
 that he was half inclined to start at once for the ranch

 but sober second thought impelled him first to think of searching
 the hills

 if she could not be found in them then it would be time enough to
 think of paying ranch v a visit

 an incident happened at the moment also that for atime prevent-
 ed any move of the sort

 pomp had begun to scale a small peak near

  praps i kin geta bettah look from up yere marse frankcried
 the darky  jes de same i tries it fo yo

  all right pomp replied frank tell me if you see anviliing
 of importance and i will come up

  a right sah

 pomp went up the peak

 he reached the top and began to look over the country when
 suddenly he beheld a thrilling scene below

 frank had gone to the cage of the canyon to look over and see
 what the steam man was about

 as he leaned over the edge of the deep gorge he did not see a
 giant form suddenly glide from a crevice in the cliff behind him

 it was in reality an enormous black bear

 the brute had caught sight of frank and being in an ugly mood
 started for him

 the bear advanced so quickly and noiselessly that frank was all
 unaware of his presence until the brute was upon him

 then a terrific blow from the bears paw sent him reeling over
 the edge of the cliff

 over the edge went the young inventor and a yell of horror and
 pain went up from pomps lips

 golly sakes marse frank hab yofallen down to yo death t
 cried the affrighted darky as he came tumbling down the peak like
 a madman

 frank had certainly gone over the edge

 the bear stood upon the verge of the precipice growling savagely

 pomp was in a frenzy of fear and horror he could not see what
 was to prevent his beloved master from going down to bis death

 he would have rushed to the spot where frank had stood but the
 bear was there

 at this moment the stillness of the gorge was broken by the shrill
 whistle of the steam man

 this was enough for pomp

 in a moment he raised his rifle and fired at the bear

 ordinarily he would have been compelled to fire many times hue
 as chance had it this single shot proved fatal

 it struck the bear full in the eye and went crashing through hii
 brain

 the big brute went over the edge of the precipice and crashing
 down into the gorge

 pomp heard plainly the crash of the bears body as it struck the
 bottom of the pass

 then he rushed to the edge and looked over

 he saw the bottom of the gorge plainly enough there lay the
 inanimate form of the bear

 the steam man stood not twenty yards distant from this pot
 and pomp saw barney far below yelling and waving his hands

 the darky answered and then caught sight of something which
 thrilled him

 clinging to a jutting bit of rock in the canyon wall he saw frank
 reade jr hanging between heaven and earth

 the astonished darky foil upon his stomach and leaned far over
 the edge of the gorge

  golly marse frank lie cried excitedly  i done fonght yo wa
 a-goner fo suah hab yo got a strong hold dar i

 pomp cried frank in sharp tones  i am nearly exhausted

 i	fear i shall lose my lioid here soon

  fo hebbons sake cried the affrighted darky don yo say
 dat marse frank if yo fell down to de cornah ob dat gorge yo
 would be killed fo suah yojes wait an dis chile will help yo

  youll have to hurry pomp cried frank in n exhausted man
 ner

  yo kin jest bet i will

  whurroo there naygur cried barnev from below  wud vex
 be afthcr letting down a rope lo mischer frank quick now or ye
 wont have the toime

 pomp acted quickiy

 the darky carried constantly a lariat at his waste

 this he lowered over the edge and down to the point where frank
 was hanging suspended between earth and sky

 pomp bad acted with great dispatch but even as the rope went
 over the edge a warning cry went up from barney below

  my godi i am falling cried frank with horror

 his hands were slipping over the edge of the jutting bit of rock to
 which he clung

 the next moment they released their grip entirely and down h-
 went

 but as good fortune had it just below him was a stump grow-
 ing out of the cliff

 against this he fell and his clothing caught upon a jagged root

 it held him firm and there he hung safe and secure

 a cry of joy went up from pomp and harney

  jes yo hang righton marse frank cried ihe darky earnest-
 ly  don yo gib way at all an dis chile he done pull you up
 arighf

  all right pomp cried frank regaining his coolness so habit-
 ual to him  i think i am safe here

  praise de lor fo dat cried the elated darky  jes hoi right
 on

 down went the lariat

 in a moment more it settled over franks shoulders

 as pomp drew on it frank made it secure under his arms

 then the darky began to draw up on the rope it required some
 exertion of strength but in a few moments frank cleared the

  rut at this moment a loud shout came up from the gorge below

 it was barneys voice raised in a note of alarm

  mv soul cried frank excitedly  what can have happened f

 both rushed to the edge of the canyon and looked over


frank keade jit and  his new steam man

ohaptek xx

the flood-corn khing the foe

 it was a thrilling sight which met t heir gaze

thev saw barney leaping up and down aud gesticulating wildly

  what is the mattert cried frank

 but before the words had fairly left hia lips lie saw what was the
 trouble	

 along the bottom of the gorge a thin stream of wacer was flow-
 ing

every moment it was increasing	

  bejabers misther frank is there much more wather cornin
 cried barney shure if so im thinkin wed better be after get-
 ting out of here

  bight cried the young inventor excitedly  but where can it
 come from

 he ran to an eminence near and from which a good view of the
 upper canyon could be had

 and there frank beheld a thrilling sight

 at the upper end of the canyon was a large lake mado by an ac-
 cumulation of logs and debris across tbe source of the canyon

 here half a score of men with axes and iron bars were engaged
 in breaking the dam so as to let the whole lake down into the
 gorge

 	would mean a flood of awful sort if they succeeded

 it would surely sweep the canyon clear and the position of bar-
 ney was a most perilous one

 frank saw tbis with horror

lie knew at once tlmt the workmen were of the cowboy gang

 already the dam could be seen to be giving way

 in a very few moments tbe flood must come no time must be
 lost

 into the canyon the water wouldjplunge and engulf everything in
 their path

 frank waited no longer

lie sprung to the edge of the canyon and shouted to barney 

  go for your life barney bun for the plain we will take cara
 of ourselves

  all right sar

 barney sprung into the cage and away went the steam man with
 a shriek down the canyon

 llie next moment a terrible roar came from the headwaters of
 the gorge and then frank and pomp saw the mighty hood coming

 like a race horse it surged down through the canyon

t was now a insd race between the steam man and the flood

 il	was a long ways to the plain below and frank groaned with
 horror as lie tealiftd the uncertainty of the steam man s reaching it

 there were places where the steam man must go slowly and this
 would mean overtaking by the hood

 hut barney with his shrewd irish wit had realized this

 he knew that it would be impossible for him to reach the plain
 before the flood

 so he decided upon a wise move

 he readied the junction of this canyon with the other

 there was not a moment to spare

 booking back he could see the water coming in mountainous bil-
 lows

 the steam man had to be checked a trifle in order to turn into
 the other canyon

 but barney made the turn all safely and the steam man shot up
 tho canyon far enough to avoid the back current of the flood

  bejabers im in luck this toime cricd the celt jubilantly as
 he opened the whistle valve

 the note of safety was heard by frank and pomp witb a sensa-
 tion of great relief and joy

 they understood al once the move made by barney

  that was a capital thought of barneys cried frank  it is
 lucky t hat he did not keep on the plains he would have been over-
 taken 

  i jes reckon dat am afac cried pomp well i fink wed bet-
 tali get back to de steam man as quick as eber we can

  you arc right pomp declared frank our position here will
 be hardly a safe one now

  youse right sail

 the hood in the canyon was now rapidly subsiding

 the great lake had quickly emptied itself into the canyon

in a short while the bed of the canyon was once more dry

 barney then ran the steam man back into the main canyon and
 frank and pomp hailed him

you did well barney cried the young inventor joyfully

 y ou made tbe best possible move

  begorra i knew well enough that i bad to git out of the wav of
 the waihers sor replied barney but shure are yez cornin
 down soon r

  we are coinin right down replied fraok

 down the canyon wall they scrambled and safely reached the
 gorge

 then they greeted barney with joy and clambered aboard
 shure phwatlver will yez do now misther frank  cried bar-
 ney eagerlv

  i shall follow the canyon up and try to dislodge the outlaws
 replied rraiik

 very good sirt cricd barney
 thinf
  yes

with readiness  well go ahead

barney took the reins and the steam man went on up the gorge

 ill	a short while they had reached the dam which had held back
 tno lake

 here a course was found directly out upon a vast plain
 r rank was about to direct tbe mans course thither when an inci-
 dent occurred to for a moment delay them

 a loud and harsh voice came from the cliff above

 hello down there 

webrled frask  een the steam man came  a bait

  yere frank beade jr eh p
 that is my name

  wall im artemas cliff i give ye fair warn in to surrender
 yere in a death trap

 thank yon for informing us retorted frank but i don t be-
 lieve ill surrender vet

  ye wont then  

 no

  then take the consequences

  i can do that

 a savage curse come down upon the air then the crack of rifles
 was heard and bullets pattered against the steel netting

 of course no harm was done aud frank only smiled grimly

 be sent the steam man up the gorge and in a few moments came
 out upon the plain which was deep among the hills aud hemmed in
 with a line of timber

 the cowboys continued to pour volley after volley into the steam
 man

 frank waited until he had reached a favorable position

 then he stopped the steam man and picking up his riue said
 gome boys lets give them as good as they send

 of course pomp and barney were ready and eager

 a destructive fire was sent into the covert of the cowboys

 in a few moments it grew so hot that they could not remain there
 and had to get out

 with baffled yells they retreated deeper into the hills
 whurroo yelled barney jubilantly shure its aisy enough
 to whip such omadhouns as they be

 golly don yo be too suah lish remonstrated pomp

  what do yez know about it naygur

 suah i know jes as much as yo does iish

  glong yex are a big stuff

  i amn t so big a wan as yo am

 say that agin an ill break the face av yez

 huh yo cant do it

 the two rogues would have had a friendly set-to then and there
 but frank interposed

  none of that he cried sternly there is serious work before
 us

 this was a quietus upon the two rascals and they ceased their
 skylarking

 the cowboys had been driven back but now a thrilling sound
 came from the distant hills

 it was the heavy volleying of many rilles there could be but
 one explanation

 evidently the cavalry had come into eonflfct with the cowboys

 a good sized battle was in progress an impulse seized frank
 he realized that he ought to join that conflict there was no
 doubt but that the steam man could do much to aid the cavalry

 so he started the man across the plain looking for an opening
 into the hills in the direction of the firing

 this it however seemed not easy fo find

 but as the man was skirting the line of timber a thrilling scene
 was suddenly brought to view

 in a small clearing in the verge of the timber two men were striv-
 ing to down one it was a terrific and deadly struggle which was
 in brogress

 thesingle fighter was holding his own well

 near by with arms tied behind her was a young girl

 it was bessie bodman

  my godl cried frank quick for your life boys we must
 put an end to that struggle dont you see it is young barrows
 and he is fighting to rescue the girl

 golly dat am a fao cried pomp excitedly jes gib me a
 chance at dem rapscallions

 up to the spot the steam man swiftlv ran

 a cry of wildest joy and hope welled up from bessie bodmaus
 lips

 young barrows also saw that rescue was at hand and made extra
 exertions to overcome his foes

 the cowboys however seeing that succor had come tried to break
 away

 as barrows was too exhausted to restrain them they succeeded
 and dashed away at full speed

 reaching their ponies they monnted and were out of sight in a
 twinkling

 the next moment barrows bad clasped besse in his arms first
 cutting her bonds

  thank heaven he cricd  we are united once more and this
 time let us hope never to part

 those aboard the steam man pretended to be busy during the
 affecting meeting

 but soon the lovers came to the cage and a general welcome fol-
 lowed

 an explanation of all followed and then plans for the future
 were quickly decided upon

chapter xxi

which is the end

 the sound of firing now came from the hills quite plainly

 it was evident that clarks men were having a hard battle
 barrows detailed his experiences as we have recorded in a prev-
 ious chapter

 then it was decided at onceif possible to join the cavalry

 if i can place miss bodman in your charge mr beade said
 young barrows gallantly i vyll gladly join the soldiers and aid
 in the repulse of the foe

  yoti may do that replied frank readily  in fact i think it
 safer for the lady to remain in the wagon hereafter

 you are very kind

 it is nothing

 accordingly bessie was given a seat in the wagon

 then barrows mounted one of the ponies left by the cowboys

  i will see you later he said lifting his hat to bessie
frank libade jr and iiis new steam man



 then lie rode awav to join the cavalry in their battle

 the sleam mail of course could not hope to follow so quickly
 the fleet pony could go through narrow paths and of course bar-
 rows reached t he scene of action long before the others
 lint frauk reade sent the steam man along at a rood pace

 after some search a pass was found and the man made its way
 carefully through and suddenly came out upon the field of action

 the cowboys were strongly intrenched iu the hills and seemed
 disposed to make a final stand

 col clarks men were making desperate attempts to drive tliefn
 from their position

 as the steam man came dashing up to the spot a great cheer
 went up from the soldiers

 frank answered it by pulling the whistle valve of the man and
 sending up a sharp note

 the man could not hope lo reach the position of the outlaws
 for the ground was too uneven

 but a position was taken up from where the battle could be
 easily watched

 then col clark came up to the wagon

 warm greetings followed nnd frank said

 is there anything i could do to help you colonel

 ithlnknot replied the gallant otlicer i believe we shall
 drive ihem out very soon now

  i hope so

  if  aui not mistaken the day of clilf and his gang are num-
 bered

 that is joyful news

  yes

  i hope you will succeed

 thank you

 the colonel rode away and the voyagers watched the contest with

 interest

 one watching the beautiful face of bessie rodman could have
 seen that she was inwardly praying for her lovers safety

 ltui fortune was with the troops though they had experienced a
 hard battle

 the position of the outlaws was a very strong one and almost un-
 as-iilable

 high walls of rock wore there for them to use as a breastwork

 it was not easy to dislodge them except at great loss of life

 but clark was not a man to be defeated

 he urged his mbn on and slowly but surely drove the foe before
 him frank lteade jr now with barney and pomp and bessie
 hodman on board took the steam man out  to the prairie

 for over an hour a kind of desultory conhict was was kept up in
 ihe hills

 then col clark suddenly came dashing up to the wagon

 we have got them dislodged he cried and i think they
 have struck out for ranch v now if you will show us the way
 mr iteade we will try and exterminate this poisonous gang

  with pleasure cried frank

 he started the steam man at once for ranch v

 across the prairie the machine rau rapidly and the cavalry gal-
 loped in the rear

 it was in the latter part of he day that all came out upon a rise
 orevlooking the stockade of ranch v

 but the cowboys had got there in advance and had made ready
 for an attack

 col clark was a man of immediate resources

 without hesitation or a moments delay he threw his men for-
 ward  the charge at almost the first attack the gate was carried
 and the soldiers entered sic yard

 hut step by step artemus cliff contested the way

 his men by divisions surrendered half a dozen or more at a time
 heiug fhus niade prisoners they were sent to the rear in this
 maimer the numbers of the cowboy gang were decimated

 suddenly a thrilling cry went up

 fire fire

 the stockade and ranch proper had been fired and great columns
 of hanie now arose

 the scene was fast becoming a thrilling one darkness was com-
 ing on and the rattle of firearms the dark shadows of night par-
 tially dispelled by the flames gave a weird aspect to everything
 slow but sure was the conquest of clift and his gang

 now he was driven to his last resort the corner of the stockade
 nearest the river scarce a score of his followers now remained

 it was utterly no use for him to resist longer the villain saw it
 but yet- kept on fighting doggedly

 surrender or die cried the lieutenant who led the squad  it
 is vour only chance

 the remaining cowboys threw up their hands but cliff pitched
 forward in a heap upon the ground struck by a pistol ball

 there he was found later under a heap of dead men he was re-
 moved to the camp near and his wounds examined

 kauch v was a thing of the past

 not a stick was left standing and of the cowbovgang fully 
 hundred had rendered up i heir final account

 possibly twenly of the cavalrymen had been killed

 it had been quite a severe battle but frank reade tr ami his
 companions could not help but feel overjoyed at the result

 barney aud pomp had an old time set-to over the victory this
 time poinp coming off victorous

 the night was passed quietly farly the next morning a surgeon
 came to the steam man and called for frank

 he announced that cliff was lying and wanted to make a con-
 fession but would makeit to nobody else

 frank hurried to the dying couch of the villain cliffs filmy gaze
 was fixed upon him eagerly and he said huskilv

  reade im done for  made a good fightbut ive lost the
 games up i might as well make a clean breast of it uncle jim is
 innocent of rodmans death sid bowen and jim dncev my
 trusted pals killed rodman and worked the whole game thats all
 i reckon i can die better now

  you have done a good deed artemus cliff said frank kindly
  and may god forgive you vour sins

 but the villain did not answer alreadv his eves were set tile
 master had called him he had cheated the gallows after all

 a grave was dug on the prairie and frank saw lhat he was prop-
 erly buried

 the confession was put in writing and duly witnessed the mis-
 sion of the new steam man to the far west was ended

								

 the spirits of all were bright and cheerful now that the end had
 come

 the extermination of the cliff gang was certainly a blessing to
 that part of the state and  one regretted the villains demise
 preparations were now made for the return home

 of course col clark and his command would return to the fort
 but frank now thought of bessie rodman

 by jupiter he muttered something must bo done for her
 poor girl she is without a friend in the world now

 barney and pomp winked at each other and barney cried 
 bejabers misther frank have yez lost ver powers av penetra-
 tion 

  i reckon yo am way off marse frank rejoined pomp

  what are you fellows driving at fisked frank in surprise

  why dat ar gal she am got one ob de bos friends in de worl
 jes yo caslyo eye ober dar an see dat spruce youngfeller what am
 walkin wid her

 frank did cast his eye in the direction indicated and saw
 bessie and young walter harrows approaching

 there was a particularly happy light upon the faces of both

  pshaw muttered frank  that young fellow cant marry her
 yet shes got to have a home in the meanwhile miss rodman
 one moment please

 the lovers paused and frank said brusquely

  i can understand your position bessie very well and i know
 that you need a home i can only offer to take you to readestown
 with me and my wife will do all iu her power-

  one moment sir said barrows with burning face  you are
 very kind but let me first explain i am this ladys natural pro-
 tector for life

  avhat gasped frank

  yes she is my wife

 pomp and harney collapsed at the expression upon franks face
 your wife gasped the young inventor when were you
 married 

 just now and the ceremony was performed by the chaplain of
 the regiment

 frank thrust forth his right hand and gave barrows a grip which
 made him wince

 you must pardon my conduct he cried but it was such a
 surprise i wish you both worlds of happiness

 some hours later the new steam man was on its way homeward
 a week later it was in omaha nebraska and not long thereafter
 was at home in readestown

 the voung inventor was received at home with an ovation nnd
 his father the distinguished reade senior was overjoyed lc learn
 that the evidence lmd been procured to clear travers

 as for the latter he came from prison like one coming info a now
 life and from that time  regarded frank reade jr as his great-
 est earthly benefactor

 the new steam man and his wonderful western trip was the talk
 of the country

 people came from near and far to see the invention and it was not
 long before the young inventor suddenly found himself involved in
 another daring project

 the now steam man was destined to make another trip and lio-
 come involved in adventures even more thrilling than these just
 recorded and a full and detailed account of the second trip maj be
 found in
