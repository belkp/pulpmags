arehfiu a blond 

     the secret of making
     people like you

the greatest asset any man can possibly
have is the faculty for making people
like him it is even more important
than ability

  the secret of making people like you lies in
your ability to understand the emotional and
mental characteristics of the people you meet

  did you know that a blond has an entirely
different temperament than a brunet-that to
get along with a blond type you must act en-
tirely different than you would to get along
with a brunet

  when you really know the difference be-
tween blonds and brunets the difference in
their characters temperaments abilities and
peculiar traits you will save yourself many a
mistake-and you will incidentally learn much
you never knew before about yourself

          

ful graham was a blond and not until he
learned that there was all the difference in the
world between the characteristics of a blond and
those of a brunet did he discover the secret of making
people like him

  paul had been keeping books for years for a large
corporation which had branches all over the countrj
it was generally thought by his associates that he
would never rise above that job he had a tremen-
dous ability with figures-could wind them around
his little finger-but he did not have the ability to
mix with big men did not know how to make people
like him

 then one day the impossible happened paul
graham became popular

 business men of importance who had formerly
given him only a passing nod of acquaintance sud-
denly showed a desire for his friendship people-
even strangers-actually went out of their way to do
things for him even he was astounded at his new
ixwer over men and women not only could he get
them to do what he wanted them to do but the
actually anticipated his wishes and seemed eager to
please him

  from the day the change took place he began
to go up in business now he is the head auditor
for his corporation at an immense increase in salary
and all this came to him simply because he learned
the secret of making people like him

  you too can have the power of making people
like you for by the same method used by paul
graham you can at a glance tell the characteristic
of any man woman or child-tell instantly the
likes and dislikes and you can make people
like you here is how it is done

everyone you know can be placed in one of two
eneral types- blond or brunet there is as big a
lifference between the mental and emotional charact-
eristics of a blond and those of a brunet as there is
letween night and day you persuade a blond in
ne way-a brunet in another blonds enjoy one
jiase of life-brunets another blonds make good
 one kind of a job-brunets in one entirely
ifferent

to know these differences scientifically is the first
tep in judging men and women in getting on well
ilh them in mastering their minds in making
hem like you in winning their respect admiration
ve and friendship

and when you have learned these differences-
hen you can tell at a glance just what to do and
ay to make any man or woman like you your
access in life is assured

  for exampla theres the case of a large manu-
icturing concern trouble sprang up at one of the
actories the men talked strike things looked
gly harry winslow was sent to straighten it out
in i he eve of a general walk-out he pacified the
non and headed off the strike and not only this
tut ever since then that factory has led all the others
or production he was able to do this because he
new how to make these men like him and do what
le wanted them to do

  another case entirely different is that of henry
eters because of his ability to make people like
lim-his faculty for getting under the skin and
naking people think his way he was given the posi-
ion of assistant to the president of a large firm
two other men both well liked by their fellow em-
loyees had each expected to get the job so when
he outside man peters came in he was looked upon
y everyone as an interloper and was openly disliked
y every other person in the office

  peters was handicapped in every way but in
ipite of that in three weeks he had made fast friends
f everyone in the house and had even won over the
iwo men who had been most bitter against him the
vhole secret is that he could tell in an instant how
o appeal to any man and make himself well liked

  a certain woman who had this ability moved with
ler family to another town as is often the case it
s a very difficult thing for any woman to break into
-lie chill circle of society in this town if she was not
tnown but her ability to make people like her
toon won for her the close friendship of many of
the best families in the town some people
bonder how she did it it was simply the secret at
ork-the secret of judging peoples character and
naking them like you



you realize of course that just knowing the
difference between a blond and a brunet could
lot accomplish all these wonderful things there
ire other things to be taken into account but here
 the whole secret

  you know that everyone does not think alike
ivhat one likes another dislikes and what offends
ne pleases another well there is your cue you
tan make an instant hit with anyone if you say

the things they want you to say and act the way
they want you to act do this and they will surely
like you and believe in you and will go miles out of
their way to please you

  you can do this easily by knowing certain simple
signs tn addition to the difference in complexion
every man woman and child has written on them
signs as distinct as though they were in letters a foot
high which show you from one quick glance exactly
what to say and to do to please them-to get them
to believe -to think as you think - to do exactly
what you want them to do

  in knowing these simple signs is the whole secret
of getting what you want out of life-of making
friends of business and social advantage every
great leader uses this method that is why he is a
leader use it yourself and you will quickly become
a leader-nothing can stop you

  you have heard of dr blackford the master
character analyst many concerns will not employ
a man without first getting dr blackford to pass on
him concerns such as westinghouse electric and
manufacturing company baker-vawter company
scott paper company and many others pay dr

the new magazine covers a field that stretches from our
daily footsteps not only back into all time but broadly
into all the world

  it is for both men and women it has no puritan-
ical standards but it will be kept relentlessly clean
love is a natural theme but there will be no salacious
sex appeal

  nor is there romance in emotions tom to lifeless
shreds by infinite analysis or in the sickly ghost sensa-
tions of the boudoir true romance lies in the real
not the artificial it may be buxom but never morbid
grimy but neither dirty nor fluffy

  romance wishes to leave its readers happier than it
found them yet tragedy is not barred for tragedy
may be uplifting not depressing problems are not
barred but they must be the problems of romance itself
not the dreary ones that drag us back into the routine
we seek to forget between the covers of a magazine

  above all good stories those by famous authors
side by side with stories having no endorsement but
their own merit

 saved

 last night i came home with great news our savings had passed the  mark

 i remember reading one time that your first thousand saved is the most important money
 ou will ever have for in saving it you have laid a true foundation for success in life and
 remember how remote and impossible it seemed then to have such a sum of money

 i was making  a week and every penny of it was needed just to keep us going it went
 on that way for several years then one day i woke up i found i was not getting ahead
 simply because i had never learned to do anything in particular as a result whenever an
 important promotion was to be made i was passed by i made up my mind right then to in-
 vest an hour after supper each night in my own future so i wrote to scranton and arranged
 for a course that would give me special training for our business

 i cant understand why i had never realized before
 that this was the thing to do why in a few months i

i

	out hkwg  - -

 minternational correspondence schools

had a whole new vision of my work the general man-
ager was about the first to note the change an opening i
came and he gave me my first real chance-with an
increase a little later another promotion came with i
enough money to save  a month then another in- 
crease-i could put aside  each pay day so it went

today i am manager of my departrent-with two in-
creases this year we have a thousand dollars saved

and this is only the beginning we are planning now
for a home of our own there will be new comforts for
rose little enjoyments we have had to deny ourselves
up to now and here is a real future ahead with more
money than i used to dare to dream that i could make
what wonderful hours they are-those hours after
supper

  for  years the international correspondence schools
have been helping men and women everywhere to win
promotion to earn more money to have happy prosper-
ous homes to know the joy of getting ahead

  more than two million have taken the up road with
i c s help over  are now turning their spare
time to profit hundreds are starting every day isnt
it about time for you to find out what the i c s can do
for you

  you too can have the position you want in the work
of your choice you can have the kind of a salary that
will make possible money in the bank a home of your
own the comforts and luxuries you would like your
family to have no matter what your age your occupa-
tion or your means-you can do it

  all we ask is a chance to prove it-without obligation
on your part or a penny of cost thats fair isnt it

born to be hanged but

                           gordon young

author of dangerous men gaboreau the terribleetc

i

i had been arrested on the eve of a
state election revolver in hand a
chamber empty by the body of
 james h thrope millionaire lum-
berman and candidate for governor

i	don everhard was tried convicted
and sentenced to death which in cali-
fornia meant to be hanged

from the day of my arrest until this i
spoke no word of defense i offered no ex-
planation and i made no statements

the time has come when i may tell my
story here it is

ii

james thrope was one of the
men-and there are many of his
kind-that i instinctively hated
and by hate i mean hate there are i
believe certain tenets in theosophy which

account for instinctive hatreds as old en-
mities carried down from a former incarna-
tion but i know nothing of theosophy
beyond that and i have always found
ultimately sufficient reasons for hating such
men without putting the responsibility on
some vague life that i may never have lived
in ages past

  thrope was the sort of man that had he
been a democrat i would at once have
declared myself a republican had he
been a republican i would have been a
democrat i mention this because he
was a powerful politician and a candidate
at the time this story ends for governor
he was a man of powerful body dominant
personality robust and more vigorous at
sixty-five than most men in the earlier
years of manhood i believe that he was
generally considered handsome his face
was covered with a short neatly trimmed
black beard

  he had married rather late in years and

adventure

had continued to be a debauchee but it
was not merely wild roisterings that black-
ened his name he was a ruthless un-
scrupulous bold fellow with no regard for
laws morals or solemn oaths his friends
said that he never broke a promise but his
friends like himself lied

  i may speak this way of the dead man
for i am saying less than i have said with
his face turned toward me

  as a politician i have no doubt that he
faithfully gave the promised jobs and graft
to those who served his party when it was
in office as a big business man i sup-
pose that he did discriminate in cheating
his associates beyond that he may not
be praised in my presence without evoking
a flat contradiction and i am likely to
speak shortly and use short words when his
name is mentioned

 yet he was known as a good fellow
his friends were legion he spent money
like water and he gathered it like a pirate

  i was rather young in those days be-
cause i had less discretion than has since
been protectively acquired out of many
troubles i did some things that none but
a young high-tempered fellow would do i
was rather proud of having a reputationasa
dangerous man and yet in all seriousness
if i now encountered such a fellow as i was
then i would very much want to spank
him

  i admit it would be risky for i was then
almost as good a shot as i am now i was
then as now almost physiologically in-
capable of being nervous or feeling fear

  the really brave man is like marshal
ney whom napoleon called the bravest
of the brave a battle was breaking and
ney it is said stood waiting the order to
charge he happened to glance down and
saw that his knees were trembling shake

-you shake he muttered and if you

knew where i am going to take you before
this day is over you would shake worse than
that

  that is courage my knees never trem-
ble they never did no matter what the
circumstances i seem to have been born
with something essentially human left out
of me and i mention this at some length to
explain how it happened that a very young
man like myself at that time had a certain
prestige among gamblers and crooks who
acknowledged no equals but men whom they
had cause to admire or to fear

  too i may say that i was a born gam-
bler and what immobility my face may
have lacked i painstakingly acquired the
inscrutable face is as essential to a suc-
cessful gambler as sensitive fingers there
are not and there never were honest gam-
blers who lived by luck alone

  what the nimblest magician may do with
cards on the stage i could do with the deck
at the poker-table-and perhaps some
other things too that was not a natural
gift any more than the musicians fingers
are bestowed by nature and no pianist ran
his scales more faithfully than i practised
with cards in my room i was even in
my teens determined to be as fine a gam-
bler as lived and i went at it thoroughly
under the very excellent tutorage of an old
fellow who in his prime had been one of
the best

  he drank his fingers were a bit slow
one night in passing liie bottom card to a
confederate and out of gratitude and friend-
ship i paid for the funeral and monument
there it stands to this day a shaft of mar-
ble among a field of solemn stones and on it
is the sardonic inscription -

as honest a man as ever palmed a card

  but i was young in those days my
family for some years did not speak my
name even in the house where i was born
i was dead to all of them it might have
been different had i not been motherless at
ten sisters brothers uncles cousins aunts
-ours was and is yet a large and proud
tribe-said i was born to be hanged and
the time came when they were considerate
enough to remind me that-

  we told you so

   a few words more to fill in some features
of my background for though this story is
verifiable in the files of old san francisco
papers-not so very old at that-yet i wish
to take the pains of making it credible with-
out sending skeptics to dusty volumes of
the chronicle

  it has been my fortune despite the at-
titude of eminently respectable relatives
even then as now to have and to hold the
friendship of a few fine and honest people
who had what they called faith in me
this is i suppose largely because i never
drank never used an oath more than three
or four times in my life was invariably
polite-as emotionless people are usually
bom to be hanged but-



never made a threat-that is a direct one
and never made a promise that i did not
keep

  it happened that a pickpocket whom i
knew quite well-he was a miserable rascal
reduced by hop and whisky to purse-snatch-
ing-sipped a womans bag in a crowd and
gloated over the contents in my presence

  a handful of bills was in it and such other
stuff as a woman usually pokes into her
bag but there was also a letter and on
the envelope of course an address-mrs
mary curwen the dope-fiend tried to
tell me what was in the letter he offered
it to me to read his words were rather
jumbled for he was half-drunk but what
he said was somewhat borne out by the
return address on the envelope

  this miserable rat saw a chance for black-
mail and was drunk enough to suggest that
i engage with him the envelope was from
the office of a congressman of the san
francisco district the pickpocket said
it was written by congressman bryan-
who was just making an announcement of
his willingness to run for governor-to mrs
mary curwen and that it spoke of a dread-
ful secret

  i did not read the letter as nearly as i
could gather the dreadful secret was not
revealedbut was suggested in some way that
seemed to the pickpocket sufficient to es-
tablish a basis for a piece o graft

  what that basis was he didnt exactly
know he urged me to read it he was
very drunk and i never quarrel with a
drunken man i took the letter and put it
aside for a day or two i was tantalizingly
interested and tempted to read it

  there is no shame in being tempted-it is
giving way to temptation that knocks the
inner props down i would no more have
read a letter found in a ripped envelope
than i would have read one in which i had
no personal interest and which was sealed
let me make myself clear on this point

  had it served some purpose of importance
to me i would not only have opened an-
other mans letter but i would have cut
into a mail bag to get at the letter but i
have a quirk of what may possibly be called
honor which would let me as readily peep
into a womans bedroom as read a letter
that does not concern me

  and i was intensely interested con-
gressman bryan was no political puppet
he was a comparatively young man and a

dynamic hard-fighting out-spoken fellow
brilliant and courageous a man-who seemed
to have arisen by sheer work and brilliancy
naturally i admired him for one thing
thrope and his party were against bryan

i shall not give any particulars of
the political fight for those details
do not concern the story it so
chanced that bryans releection to congress
had recently taken place but he was willing
to resign and run for governor the
state needed an honest governor if
thrope should be elected the skull-and-
crossbones might as well have floated from
the flagpole at sacramento

  it was to be a hard and bitter campaign
it always was when bryan and thrope
fought one of the features of the bryan
workers argument had always been the
emphasis laid on the fact that he was a
san francisco boy orphaned in babyhood
whose whole life had been lived under the
eyes of san franciscans who might examine
every feature of it and know that his record
was stainless

  so i told the purse-snatcher that he was
too drunk to have read straight

  i thought of returning the letter to mrs
curwen by mail but in case the letter did
contain any matter that would trouble her
if she knew it had passed under the eyes of
strangers she could not be reassured by
anything i might write to accompany the
letter itself

   so i returned the letter in person

  the house was a modest solid little home
the yard was well kept the lawn fresh the
shrubs trimmed the paint new

  a young woman neat and attractive-
that is intelligent of face as well as pretty
but with a wilful set to her ups-opened the
door she was slender and dark and i
judged though nothing of an expert in
matters of the kind around twenty

  i asked for mrs curwen and was shown
into a little sun-lighted room

  mrs curwen came in my impression
of strangers is always definite i like them or
i do not

  the moment i saw her i felt as deep
sympathy for her as i ever felt for any one
tragedy was written on her face and wor-
ries were in her eyes she had suffered at
sometime or other and deeply her eyes had
the steady wide-lidded stare of people who
have been forbidden things and kept silent


adventure

  she was nervous and troubled and i
knew something of what the heavy lines
that fell from her nostrils to the corners of
her mouth meant the mouth itself was
drawn tightly the full lips were thinned by
having been set hard yet hers was a
pleasant face lighted from an inner glow
of contentment i will call it a beautiful
face all beautiful faces have the mark of
tragedy upon them

  she was tall well-poised and i would
have guessed somewhere above fifty-ob-
viously the mother of the girl who had
met me at the door

  you wish to see me she asked

  i referred at once to a letter addressed to
her that had come to my attention

  there was no mistaking the importance of
that letter to her at the first mention she
stiffened as one does to receive a blow i
may have imagined it but it seemed to me
that she also assumed for a second a grim
reconciliation to the blow that was expected
it was as if she rather knew blow after
blow of some kind would reach her and
she had reached the age of passive resistance

  i then told her precisely what had hap-
pened and extended the letter

  i do not know what the letter contains
i do not wish to know it has been read
only by a drunken fellow who may believe
he merely dreamed what he read and i
have brought it in person so that you may
be assured that nobody except the fellow
mentioned has meddled with the contents
she said nothing for a moment but
reached out a hand that trembled slightly
and laid it on my arm and the fingers
closed for an instant in a way deeply ex-
pressive of gratitude

  mrs curwen looked at me with a kind
of suspended admiration in her eyes and
asked-

  what did you say your name was

  i told her i had not at that time taken
the name of everhard my family name is
richmond i told her-don richmond
almost incredulously she exclaimed

 don richmond-you a mere boy-
and you are the man who struck jim
thrope in the face i-i-have often
wondered about you a mere boy

  my shoulders stiffened a little as i re-
marked that i was twenty-four and no
doubt my maimer implied that twenty-four
was a full-grown manly age

  i understand she said quietly almost

proudly as if in some way i was closely
related to her why this letter has been
returned-unread and do you know- i
would doubt almost any other man that
brought it

  i looked at her in puzzlement and asked-

  do you know me

  yes-i know that you hit jim thrope
in a crowded dance-hall hit him in the face
before all of his friends yes indeed i
do know you and she impulsively caught
my hand into both of hers and pressed it

  i did not understand

  with quick maternal-like half-phrases
she regretted that i was a gambler and
lived such a life

  a professional gambler for six years
she exclaimed i knew you were young-
but so young

  she said that she had heard all about the 
affair-more even than was in the papers
some of which called me a young ruffian
who was boasting he had insulted so dis-
tinguished and honorable a citizen as james
h thrope and one or two of the papers
which told something like the truth colored
it rather highly in my favor because they
happened to be politically opposed to
thrope

  the basic fact which nobody knew was
that i hated thrope instinctively his
eyes-it is into the eyes that one looks for
an understanding of people-were the in-
solent lewd vicious eyes of the bully

  i never saw him without wanting to
strike him in the face something of what
that meant may be conveyed when i ex-
plain that in all the troubles i have been
into and got out of i have never struck a
half-dozen men with my fists

a night came when thrope was
on one of his periodical debauches
and came into the empress dance-
hall where i chanced to be awaiting an
appointment he was sober enough but
this time it would probably not have made
any difference to me if he had been drunk
a little fool of a dance-hall girl ambitious
to get attention from so distinguished a
rounder clutched at his coat

  he turned at one glance saw that she was
not pretty then drove his fist into her face
and many people laughed thrope was
always followed on such occasions by
friends of the kind-by men who would
laugh if a womans face ran blood
born to be hanged but-



  i had gone up to him there was noth-
ing of haste or hurry in my manner i said
distinctly that perhaps he did not know how
it felt to be struck in the face then deliber-
ately hit him a back-handed blow squarely
across the mouth blood dripped from his
lips

  i said nothing more without turning
my face from him i pushed a chair out from
behind me and took one backward step so
that my shoulders were against the wall

i did not care to be shot or slugged from the
rear

  i heard my name tossed back and forth
i was pretty well known there was a
scrambling and stamping as some people
made for places where they thought bullets
would be least likely to hit and others full
of gaping curiosity crowded close behind
thropes back

  but nothing happened i mean nothing
of importance  was cursed and threat-
ened friends of thropes who but a
few seconds before had laughed scowled
and cursed bullies usually try to save
their faces by scowls when they are not
ready to venture further

  thrope half swung his hand toward his
hip so far as he could see i was unarmed
but he did not draw or try to draw per-
haps he had heard-and believed-the
rumor that the reason i had never been
tried for any one of a few little gun-plays
was because i never made a move until it
became evident that i had to shoot in self-
defense

  there was perhaps a little truth in that
report though much exaggeration in
those days i used a single action -two of
them-and i wore a double-breasted coat
i dont know whether automatics had been
invented or not anyway they were not
worth considering

  the colt is meant for quick work they
were worn diagonally across my stomach
and carried cocked that helped to culti-
vate in me a slow deliberate manner and a
certain unbending attitude-much as would
be cultivated in a man who carried dyna-
mite in his pocket all i needed to do to
shoot quick was to thrust my hand inside
the coat on a level with the stomach-
an entirely unsuspicious movement-and
half-turning my body to point the gun
press the trigger

  of course i shot through the coat the
gun was very awkward to carry there but

the awkwardness had compensations in
dangerous moments thrope probably sus-
pected that i would not be unagitated if i
did not feel secure

  it is fair perhaps to say that he may
have believed there were as many friends of
mine as of his in the room that the insult
had been planned and that he was in a trap
prepared beforehand i offer that as an
explanation for though thrope was in-
trinsically a coward he was proud and high-
tempered and it hardly seems likely that i
-though even then men of stronger nerves
than iris hesitated to take up my challenge-
could have by mere poise so humiliatingly
have bluffed him

  lie cursed in the way of a man who does
not mean to fight promised me sudden
death at some future time intimating that
it would not be far distant either then
withdrew with his friends who glowered
over their shoulders

  the incident attracted much more at-
tention than the mere facts warranted all
of course because james thrope was a
figure of importance

  so it was not surprizing that mrs cur-
wen knew of it

  the surprizing thing was the interest
that this quiet and lovely woman grayed
and wrinkled showed in an incident of the
tenderloin

i suggested that it was strange
she should have paid so much at-
tention to a mere affair of the un-
derworld

   i know of jim thrope she said

  but i must pause to tell as nearly as i
can how she said it bitterly came the
words i know- then a perceptible
pause the of seemed forced into the
sentence and jim thorpe was spoken
almost in a whisper as if only by overcom-
ing a strong repugnance could she speak his
name what that manner of saying i
know of jim thrope conveyed to me is
obvious

  i know of jim thrope i have often
wondered why no man dared to treat him
as he deserves

  i assured her that there were many who
dared that thrope was by no means re-
garded as the terror she seemed to think

  she seemed to doubt me

  when i started to go her hand again
touched my arm as if to check me


adventure

  you will come to see me to dinner
helen and i are alone we have few
friends

  i suggested that she would probably have
still fewer when it became known that she
was friendly with me

  you mean thrope would do something

  i wasnt thinking of him but of your
respectable neighbors i am what is some-
times called a habitue of the tenderloin

  she ignored that with a little gesture as
if she knew too much about respectable
people to care what they thought and asked
me anxiously if thrope had made trouble
for me since that affair

  he had not

  i did not go into details and explain to
her that it was not an easy matter for any-
body to make trouble for me unless they
came to my face i have known men and
attended the funerals of some of them who
scorned the cowardly precaution of watch-
ing against shots and blows from the rear
i am not such a one

  i am very cautious the more so be-
cause though i always have had many
friends i have never used any of them
as a body-guard they have helped me
many times i have called on them often
what i mean is that i have always gone
through darkened streets alone if there was
nothing but the suspicion that somebody
might be lying in wait for me my ears are
keen my hands are quick and i seldom miss
and i am never off guard never to be taken
unawares-if tense watchfulness is a pre-
ventive

  i have said that thrope did not make
trouble for me over the episode then six
months past but of course i had no way
of knowing whether the rooming-house in
which i stayed had been fired because the
incendiary wanted to burn me sleeping or
some one else in the house or merely had a
grudge against the proprietor

  i sleep lightly too lightly for my own
comfort a creak a voice at a distance a
draft puffing from an opened window
almost any sort of a noise makes me at
once alert i had no way of knowing
whether it was some one who had taken
thropes money or who had mistaken me
for another party that sprang from a door-
way one night leaping for my back with an
uplifted knife nothing was revealed of
the mans identity at the inquest for though
i attended i was not called as a witness

  the instant i had shot i slipped into the
doorway for a minute then came out pre-
tending to be one of the scrambling crowd
attracted by the report and i did not re-
main long enough to have the police get
mine among the names of those who had
been first arrivals on the scene

  a few other little incidents of a much
less menacing character than those just
mentioned had happened within the six
months but i had no way of connecting
them with thrope

  so i assured mrs curwen that thrope
had not se far as i knew made trouble

  she agitatedly assured me that he would
she begged me to leave the city for a time
anyway

  if he is waiting like that-it means you
wont have a chance please please listen
to me i do know james thrope i know
every villainous drop of blood in his body
he is the vilest man that ever lived if

that letter had got to his hands- she

flung her hands up to her face and did not
finish

  there were tears in her eyes when her
hands dropped away but she was more
composed in manner she said that she
could never never thank me enough and
wouldnt i please come again to see her-
soon

  she said one thing that stayed with me
and things of sentiment do not usually re-
main long in my ears-

  i know jim thrope so well that i want
to treat you as my son

  helen she said calling to the young
girl that came past the door

  this is the young man that struck
james thrope in the mouth

  the girls dark eyes flashed and i saw
her body stiffen slightly she was far
different from the pleasant smiling girl
who had welcomed me at the door

  oh she said and nothing more but
she watched me steadily her face expres-
sionless but hard set and her eyes burned
strangely

  it was days before i could get those
people and that visit out of my mind or
rather into the background of my thoughts

  there was not only mystery but mystery
compounded at the name of thrope
mrs curwen had become a woman of
almost tragic intensity i can not and
never could let puzzling circumstances be
forgotten until i have thought them over
born to be hanged but-



rom every conceivable angle and the most
plausible conclusion i could arrive at-
taking the bryan letter into consideration
as could not be avoided-was that mrs
curwen had suffered from some unusual
villainy at thropes hands and had con-
fided with congressman bryan for what use
he cared to make of it politically

  since the pickpocket had mentioned
dreadful secret and spoken of blackmail-
though he had been drunk when he read
the letter-i concluded that he had seen
possibilities of extortion from her

  all that was in a way easy enough to
settle it really troubled my thoughts less
than the continual reappearance of the
dark pretty girl who smilingly had met
me at the door but having spoken only a
monosyllabic oh stared at me with
enigmatic tenseness while i was leaving

  i could not imagine what it meant but
james thrope was real and omnipresent in
that little home his personality shadowed
it-and yet when i had first come in there
had been every indication of happiness

  i didnt understand i did not greatly
care to understand except in so far as i am
annoyed by the incomprehensible that is
one reason i have taken some pains to keep
out of the way of women particularly of
young ones they all have something of
helen curwen in them something enig-
matic inexplicable something that may be
taken either as sinister or as worshipful

  whether she hated me or was tense and
inarticulate from gratitude for having laid
my knuckles in thropes face was something
that could not be distinguished by her
manner it might have been either which-
ever way it was she was deeply shaken
and obviously miss curwen was a passion-
ate tense volatile young woman

ill

l i i was soon given some other things
to think about though in a way these
j too had a bearing on miss and mrs
curwen

  zellers the pickpocket more familiarly
known as hop-probably an abbrevia-
tion of hop-head-had evidently not
been so drunk as i thought he had
talked apparently a good deal about his
letter he had talked promiscuously

  the fact that he told contlicling reports
and elaborated what the letter contained at

every recital did not at all minimize the
interest his drunken blabbering had stirred
up in a most surprizing fashion

  i began to have people speak to me about
the letter some ventured to intimate that
they would like to read it two fellows of
zellers stripe with himself hanging sheep-
ishly at their coat-tails came to demand it
of me it was zellers letter not mine

   i ought to give it up et cetera et cetera to
the point of intimating that i had appro-
priated it for a little personal graft on my own
behalf for fellows who had put on such an
assertive manner and talked at such length
they made rather abrupt apologies and
retired without knowing any more about
the letter than when they came

  what i thought must certainly be the
climax arrived the day after i had returned
the letter in the presence of a stranger who
introduced himself as edwin ellis and
asked for a private conversation he was
obviously from the other world-the busi-
ness world he had brains and a knowledge
of men in general but i fancy that i added
a little to his store of information concern-
ing men in particular

  mr edwin ellis was a small man neat
as a burnished rapier and much like that
most flexible subtle and sharpest of all
weapons he opened with commendable
directness scrutinizing my face with flint-
like gray eyes and perhaps wondering how
a young man of my age could have the repu-
tation i had

  i understand he said in a straight
businesslike manner and tone that you
have come into possession of a letter from
the office of congressman bryan

  a pause his manner was sharply in-
terrogatory i said nothing

  am i correct

  go on i replied noncommittally

  there is no occasion to go on until i
have assurance on that point

  very well i said

  i was curious of course i didnt want
him to get away without knowing why he
came but the supreme schooling in bluff
is had at the green table

  you decline to answer yes or no

  i see no reason for answering yes or no
until i understand why you ask

  he paused thoughtfully not once shifting
his eyes from mine i reflected that he
would have made a fine poker player but
i guessed that he had probably chosen law


adventure

it too is a fine gape for clever crooks
an honest lawyer-that is honest in spirit
rather than merely scrupulously observant
of what is called the ethics of the pro-
fession- will i am sure become as fa-
miliar with empty pockets as an honest
gambler he was i found later not a
lawyer but a detective and from the east
so different from such detectives as i knew
that he had none of their mannerisms

  mr ellis and i lapsed into silence we
would probably have remained all through
the afternoon and all night too if he had
not at last decided that i did not intend to
say anything more until he advanced the
conversation

  he did with customary directness thus-
i am prepared to pay you any reason-
able sum you may ask if you place the letter
in my hands

  figuratively i sat up and took notice
actually i did not let a muscle of face or
finger move

  reasonable

  my intonation finished the question
made it explicit how much did he consider
the maximum of reasonable i was
really anxious to know of how much impor-
tance measured in terms of money that let-
ter was considered

  with the air of a man who thought he was
iriving home his bargain he said-

  ten thousand

  i let a second or two pass then barely
shook my head but made no other reply

  that got under his armor he ex-
claimed-

  youve read the letter-you know you
cant possibly get more than that out of
it

  how do you know its contents i
isked quickly

  i dont he said as quickly but i
enow who the concerned parties are and i
mow what they will pay

concerned parties-how do you mean
i will mention no names no names
a pause then- but how much will you
take to give the address-the address of
that letter

  i wondered whether he was after infor-
mation after the address on that letter or
whether he wanted to find out whether or
not i would give it up or if possibly that it
was a subtle play on his part to get some
reassurance that i did have the letter
again he might fear-or hope-that the

letter had got out of my possession with-
out my having noted the address

  i wont give further details of the con-
versation in much the same manner as
already related i at last succeeded in get-
ting him to offer five hundred dollar for the
address and i declined without comment

  it must be made plain that this edwin
ellis was no ordinary person he did not
lose his temper and he was straight busi-
ness all the way but having discovered
nothing of value he prepared to go

  young man he said quietly but rather
impressively i did not believe a fraction
of what i had heard of you-i made in-
quiries before coming i have rather al-
tered my opinion you have brains you
have nerve and you are stubborn of
course what i want is the letter but
there is some altruism in my pointing out to
you that any party or parties who are pre-
pared to offer a voluntary blackmail of ten
thousand dollars for the recovery of that let-
ter will not be likely to hesitate at violence

  i thanked him for he had been gentle-
manly about it but i have heard that as
a child as a mere baby the surest way of
getting me to do something was by threaten-
ing to punish me if i did it which of course
is only a kind of legend that my family
kept alive to illustrate a certain stubborn-
ness that has not wholly left me

  will you tell me this he asked with a
frank directness that i liked how much
more is the other side bidding for that
letter maybe i can meet it

  i was tempted to tell him that there had
been no other bid but he would probably
have thought i was lying-and that might
have led to unpleasant complications-so
i kept silent beyond replying that i could
say nothing

  the situation had reached the intensity
where i felt it my right to know something
definite about that letter or at least to
talk it over with mrs curwen

  i weilt to her home no one was in
the neighbors did not know where she was
she and her daughter had been gone for
some days it was evident that the de-
parture had been sudden for the neighbor
on the right declared she and mrs curwen
were the best of friends were always
running in and out of each others back
door that mrs curwen was a lovely wo-
man and that she had said nothing of
planning to go away
born to be hanged but-

ii

  so i went my way and wished sincerely
that i had had no scruples about prying
into the content of that letter i could
have kept silent and lied i am excellent at
keeping silent and on crucial occasions i am
not likely to be called a liar-no matter
what i say i tell the truth more frequently
than is comfortable because i have an aver-
sion to lying for one thing i dont like to
give any man credit for being too formida-
ble for me to dare tell him the truth

  and then too there is something con-
temptible about lying-except when it
becomes magnificent a thing that can hap-
pen to no man more than once or twice in a
lifetime and then inevitably in connection
with some womans fate

  a poet the one poet that i read has said

        if there be trouble to herward

       and a lie of the blackest can clear-

       lie-while thy lips can move

        or a man is alive to hear

  my own regard for women is not that
great but my admiration for men who
have such a regard for them is excessive

those remarks have not led me
so far from my story as may appear
but to get back to that letter
zellers waylaid me at every corner and
whined for his letter i would not explain
as well have tried to explain to a leech
that it should not suck blood naturally
he thought i was playing a lone graft
and he became something more than
objectionable-a pest

  he circulated whatever report of me he
felt like among whatever crowd gave him
a drink i did not greatly care about
that what people think of me is their
own business and i seldom interfere except
when they meddle with my business-at
such times i am at pains to correct wrong
impressions of me for people who judge
me aright do not often try to meddle

  but when zellers accompanied by three
men this time two of them recognizable
as liegemen of james thrope came at me
in a body and tried to talk what they called
business i thought the time had come
to be firm

  i was told pointedly that thrope had
it in for me and that of course i knew
what that meant but that thrope was
interested in zellers letter and if i would
give it up i could name my price

  i suggested that mr thropes interest
could not be so very great since he had not
come in person and i said that if i heard
any more about that letter of the same
nature that had been coming back to me
through friends that had listened to zellers
i might give it up on the stipulation that
zellers was permanently silenced-and that
i did not greatly care how

  the little malevolent rat was thoroughly
frightened he knew that the methods of
obtaining silence in that quarter of the city
ranged from chinese hatchet-men to an
overdose of chloral from a blow in the dark
to being pitched with tied hands and
weighted feet into the bay

  thropes men made their bid a some-
what larger one than mr ellis had offered
so i imagined that he having failed men
thought to be more nearly in my class were
delegated to try their persuasive power
and they retired with somewhat more
direct threats than mr ellis had sug-
gested i was under the impression that
ellis himself was a thrope man

  zellers went with them but he came
furtively to me later in the evening he
was frightened he whined as usual about
being a poor fellow who needed a little
honest money and declared he knew that
i wouldnt throw over a good friend like
himself

  according to his interpretation of our
friendship which on my part had never
extended beyond giving him an occasional
dollar or so for drugs and booze though
he always asked for the money under the
euphemism of food we had been rocked
in the same cradle and maintained a sort
of damon-pvthian friendship

  youse undnt trow me over fer dis
bunch o grafers udju

  i suggested that he tell me what was
behind all this effort and rumor about that
letter

  he didnt know he really didnt his
memory was none of the best and having
been drunk at the time of reading it he
didnt know what was in the letter but
his imaginative tongue had overcome that
little handicap until by his report the
letter contained enough specific informa-
tion to have convicted congressman bryan
of compounded felony and implicated any
number of other persons he did not
remember the  party to whom the letter
was addressed but it was a woman and


adventure

there was some kind of an intimate relation
between her and bryan

  that information of course did much
to explain why such a persistent effort was
being made to get hold of it

  the report had circulated among the
tenderloin that zellers had made a lucky
find of something on bryan the report
had percolated up into the ears of thrope
and he would have any day given an arm
to get something on bryan political
enemies never were more bitter

  my interest in the letter dropped to
almost zero when i arrived at that con-
clusion i told zellers he had better make
haste to start a contradictory report
because if the letter was produced thrope
and his gangsters would probably be
furious to find he had so misled them

  he was shaken but wanted to see the
letter i told him that i had sent it to the
party whose name was on the envelope
he wanted the name and received the
answer that might be expected

  so i thought the episode of the letter
was definitely settled

  then mr ellis again called on me

  he laid down ten one thousand dollar
bills said-

  there you are sir took up his hat
and started to go without another word

 but he seemed amused-not amused
exactly but possessed of a great deal of
knowledge that he didnt intend to reveal
it was my turn to ask questions and i did
he knew as much about silence and evasive-
ness as i had on the previous occasion

  why the money

  it belongs to you

  marked i asked eying the bills an
easy way to get a man into the penitentiary
is by marked bills

  examine them

  you could have kept a record of the
numbers

  certainly he admitted

  but why offer this i told you be-
fore-

  i am not offering it i am leaving it
the money is yours

  it irritates me to be puzzled i looked
at him for some time and said nothing
neither did he i wasnt in the mood to
play a waiting game it was i who wanted
information this time

  tell me something definite-or take
the money

  certainly he said politely with a
slight well-mannered trace of amusement
the party i represent-though very
severely condemned in certain quarters-
is a man of his word the letter which
we know to have passed through your hands
has been placed in the hands of the party
to whom it belongs hence the price
agreed upon i would have given it to
you before but i only lately learned all
the facts i congratulate you sir on your
discretion and honesty

  with that he went out and left me
standing there ten thousand dollars on
the table and ten thousand questions
tugging at my thoughts

iv

so the letter had been delivered
but i said to myself the party
who received it had paid the wrong
person that was something for him to
worry about not for me

  yet edwin ellis did not look like the sort
of man who would make mistakes of the
kind

  i tried to find out something about him
but he was a stranger in the city he had
stayed at the palace had registered his
address as city and disappeared the day
following his mistake

  i again tried to locate mrs curwen
but she had not returned had not been
heard from

  there was one way i could probably
find out something i had thought of it
many times i had even written and
destroyed one letter to congressman bryan
who had returned and was opening his
campaign in the southern part of the state
i came near writing another but decided
that i might as well let the matter drop

  it was not really a decision so much as
the fact that something else of a different
nature happened which interfered with
my affairs some days later i left san
francisco for a time-took a little trip
toward honolulu in fact i was so anxious
to go that i went on a windjammer i de-
cided to travel along about midnight and
passed the golden gate about dawn

  i had known ever since the little incident
with thrope that the police in their ver-
nacular wanted to get something on me
it is easy enough for the police to get
something on anybody but they had to
bom to be hanged but-



get something definite and serious on me
to make a case of it for though thrope
was what is known as the man higher up
in san francisco at that time i was a
member in good standing of the gamblers
who gave the police and the men higher
up a large share of their graft

  it happened that spike delaney was
what is known as the boss of the under-
world and delaney was a hard-fisted in-
dependent fellow who though hand in
glove with thrope yet stood on his own
two feet and could not be worked over
like putty to any purpose that did not
appeal to him

  delaney liked me and delaney-who
was just about as square as a man of his
position could be which means little more
than that he was square with the people
he liked-would have thrown a wrench
into the wheels of any ordinary frame-up
designed to stow me in san quentin

  i seldom played in tenderloin dives
there were two or three up-town clubs
known on the qt to sporty rich men and
their sons and especially to tourists where
i sat in usually

  and i must pause here to say that i did
not always or even frequently cheat i
gambled first because i liked it only
secondarily to make a modest living
there is no sport in sure-thing gambling
i mean there is no thrill none of the thrilling
impact of bluff and luck as one studies the
inscrutable face across the table and
wonders whether to call or raise or do
neither

  i must say here too though perhaps i
shall not generally be believed that i
stacked and dealt from the bottom more
times for the benefit of fellows who knew
nothing about how their luck had changed
than ever i did for myself

  despite what many wise card players
maintain a deck can be stacked in the
shuffle-if there are not more than three
or at the most four players but in a half-
dozen riffles of the cards i can put a good
hand at the bottom and deal it at will
though the eyes of twenty men are on me
there is no way to tell when a good man
is actually dealing from the bottom

  there is one way to tell when he actually
is not that is if he holds the deck as most
people do-and professional gamblers never
unless under suspicion-with the forefinger
of the left hand pressed against the front

and not the side-where the other three
fingers are-of the deck

  it happened that delaney one afternoon
asked me to sit in at a certain table in the
back of his saloon some friends of his had
told him they were bringing on a live one
and as delaneys best houseman was on a
periodical drunk i was requested to make
sure that the fellows fat pocketbook did
not leave with him delaney had made
a similar request two or three times before
it was pretty well known that when the
houseman went on a bat i would take
his place

  the table was put apart in a little private
room two other men strangers to me
but o kd by delaney sat in the game
then a fellow a regular delaney come-on
brought in the live one- a mr smith
the name evidently being taken as a con-
venience for a little fling at high life

it took me just about three
hands to discover that there were
only two poker players at that
table whoever had picked mr smith
for a sucker a greenhorn had made a
monumental mistake i knew it the minute
i saw him pick up the deck he tried to
be awkward enough in the shuffle but
the position of his fingers as he dealt made
me cautious about putting much faith
in the three fair queens that came into my
hand

  he played with that cool steely quality
that marks the real gambler and can not
be assumed it comes only after years of
tense play and to some men not even
then

  i drew to the three queens of course
although it cost a neat little sum for every-
body was staying i was presented with
two fives-flip flip just like that smith
helped himself to three cards it doesnt
make any difference what the others
drew

  a modest bet was made on my right
it was up to me to call raise or quit
i carelessly tossed my hand away-and
caught the expression in smiths eyes as
he saw me do it i had wanted to see his
face-not his hand

  but i saw the hand anyway smith
threw it away-face up-and disclosed a
pair of tens he had palmed whatever
else had been used to strengthen the hand
if indeed he had not relied on the fellow
h

adventure

to his right who took the pot without being
called i saw smith however dispose
of the palmed cards

  i did not see the cards for one never
does when a skilful man has them but he
casually reached out and touched the dis-
cards and when the hand was withdrawn
there were three cards one precisely on
top of the other quite good-and inci-
dentally i made a note for my own future
benefit of the fact that one should never
deposit palmed cards in the discards without
pretending to gather the cards up

  nobody would with their eyes open
ordinarily go to the trouble of trying to
fleece a professional gambler but here
was a frame-up of some kind had these
men learned that on the day before i had
been given ten thousand dollars was
delaney in on the deal or had he too been
imposed on naturally the situation
prodded my temper

  the climax was delayed for some time
but it came in an unexpected flash i was
dealing both hands were engaged smith
said-

  youre dealing from the bottom

  and a muzzle of his gun appeared above
the edge of the table

  as a matter of fact i had not been dealing
from the bottom i was caught unpre-
pared there was nothing to do but sit
motionless hands across the table holding
the deck and a card that i had about to
toss

  you tin-horn he said will you leave
town by train or by hearse

  i glanced right and left the three
other men at the table showed no surprize
they had known what was coming i
had been caught in a little frame-up i
guessed that delaney knew of it and had
insisted that i be given the chance to leave
town

  there is a peculiar psychology in crooks
they knew i had not been cheating they
knew that i knew i had not been cheating
and yet they pretended to think i had so
as to have an excuse to order me out of
town

  i did not intend to go i did not intend
to promise to go i let the deck slip
quietly at the same time raising my hands
and sitting back in the chair-straightening
up with hands raised symbolic of surrender

  i had never advertized the fact that
i wore a gun across my stomach for half

the efficacy of the device and position was
in the fact that no one expected it to be
there but i couldnt possibly reach for it
while covered it would have been sheer
idiocy

  i turned to the come-on who had intro-
duced smith into the game and said-

  search me-so i can drop my hands
and talk

  he looked inquiringly at smith and
smith nodded

  he removed the gun from my hip ran
his hand all around my trousers band and
tapped me right and left under the shoulders
for a shoulder holster i sat with stomach
drawn in to do something to keep the gun
from accidentally coming in contact with
his fingers he was satisfied

  i sat down lowered my hands and tapped
my fingers moving them about with nerv-
ous gestures that i did not feel

  now just what is the proposition i
asked

  a train or hearse-and that goes

  his hand lay on the table circling the
handle of the revolver a twist of the
wrist and a pressure of the trigger was
all that he need give he had put the gun
that had been taken from me into his own
holster it was a good gun

  suddenly the table raised up the round
top like a great buckler cutting me off mo-
mentarily from smiths eyes but he fired
anyway the bullet splintered through
the top of the table

  i had had to use both hands to tilt the
table between us i had had to have a
tenth of a second of safety in which to
reach under the breast of my coat for the
gun i dont care how subtle or quick a
man is he cant move quicker than the
fellow with the drop can pull a trigger

  i was afraid to try to slip my hand up
under the coat gradually for suspicion
might be aroused and another search made
and it would have been inviting death to
have made an abrupt gesture and though
it took me longer to heave up that table
and the gesture was more conspicuous yet
it was safer

  any one who doubts need only sit at a
table and try the two movements smith
was used to men reaching for a gun he
knew what that gesture meant and the
moment a hand flashed from sight he
would have shot but he was not used to
tables rising both my hands were in
born to be hanged but-	

sight the fingers above the edge of the
table-but the thumbs were not he
hesitated to see what was happening then
shot-too late

  when delaney and some of the people in
the saloon came on the bound they found
two men facing my gun with hands lifted

  the man called smith lay crumpled and
limp on the floor face down-in a witchs
mirror of blood pie was dead

i was cornered the room had no
windows and but one door it was
a small room a poker room and
the one door was filled delaney stood
in it a gun in either hand and behind him
rank on rank of men-risking their lives for
the chance to crane a neck over the shoulder
of the fellow in front

  spike i said youve trapped me
shoot if you want to commit suicide

  he might have been able to kill me-but
not before a bullet would have been on its
way toward him

  he started to speak but i cut him short
there was no time to lose quickly
sharply i told him that if he did not want
to commit suicide to turn around face the
crowd with leveled guns and clear a way
for me for i was going to follow him with
a gun pressed against the small of his back
i let it be known that if anybody made a
move at me i would get him delaney first

  spike delaney turned his back and filled
the door and he put a lot of feeling into
the words that he spoke to the crowd

  but there would be three men behind my
back the moment my face was turned i
knew they were armed-or at least i never
found out that they were not there was
no time to search

  down on your knees and face that way
i said indicating the wall

  they went down and grotesquely as-
sumed an attitude of prayer perhaps they
were praying as cowards do

  then i realized that after i took five
steps out into the saloon i would have even
more men behind me some of whom would
not be cowards

  step slow spike and step carefully
i said and pressed my shoulders against
his own

  one gun which i had recovered from
smith i poked against delaneys side with
the other i kept the people through whom
we passed not covered exactly but bluffed

  spike was roaring right and left

  cant you see hell kill me if you dont
get out of the way-get you-

  spike was eloquent when aroused but his
words were not choice people in that part
of the town were used to obeying spike de-
laney and too none of those around about
appeared to be friends of smiths-and it is
only the police who go out of their way to
fight with the victor of a duel so we got
through to the alley door safely enough

  god that was a clever stunt said
spike when we had cleared the crowd

  drop those guns face about he
did i never thought you would
double-cross me i said

  id a shot quick he said youd
better go through keep up the bluff-
tell me to beat it back toward the bar

  it dawned  me that spike delaney
did not know that he lured me into a trap
by asking me to take the place of his house-
man in that poker game and i understood
why with so much alacrity he had cleared
the way through the crowd for me he wa
gladly helping me make a getaway

  there was  time to parley so i sent him
toward the bar and sprang through the
alleyway door and was gone

  let some one who knows explain why it
is that a gambler always carries all the
money that he has i do not know i
only know that they all do it and one of the
things i was long in getting used to was a
checking account

  my bank was my inside vest pocket if
i happened to be pretty well capitalized
i used both vest pockets and the hip all
the money that i had was on me and when
one is departing in a hurry that is the mnin
thing-money

  i knew that i had to keep out of sight
for a while the three witnesses had been
there ready to have sworn that smith
murdered me in self-defense and they
would as readily declare that i had shot him
when he wasnt looking such evidence
would have convicted a more innocent
man than myself a man with less powerful
enmity directed at him from james thrope

  delaneys friendship was valuable but
he could not without trouble for himself
have bucked a combination such as i was
up against besides his regard for me wras
one only of friendship his relation with
thrope and the police and judges was one
of business
i

adventure

  when i was younger even than at that
time i used to vow that i would never run
never be a fugitive i swore to stand and
see it through-it being anything that
might happen but i have run frequently
far and fast i ran that night-figuratively
of course for nothing would so readily
have started pursuit as for me to have been
seen flying along

i went down to the water-front
and poked about cautiously i
did not want to be seen that is to
be noticed particularly for i knew thrope
would urge the police to do their duty
when he heard of what had happened
but i was not without a few friends scat-
tered through the water-front saloons

  i have friends everywhere-i have always
had them every place that does not mean
i am such a person as people are eager to
know and help though outside of my own
family very few people have been ashamed
to have their names linked with mine but
i like friends particularly i like the so-
called outcasts who are the best and most
loyal friends

  and i try never to refuse any man a favor
so long as he is not up to some sort of
deviltry that even my slack code occasion-
ally but at such tunes rigidly refuses to
countenance i was young in those days
and youth likes vivid phrases so i told
myself that all of us gamblers crooks of
one kind and another belonged to the
legion of the damned-and should go to
-together

  i have recovered a little from such
imaginative crudities but in doing so
i have lost something irrecoverable of
the zest of life this flickering of remi-
niscence is intended to throw a little light
on the fact that the reason i hovered watch-
fully that night at the rear of the ship
saloon was because the bartender then on
watch-as i could see by peeping through
the door-was one sam tyler

  sam tyler was a sailorman who recover-
ing consciousness after a free-for-all in
delaneys saloon found himself not only
empty of pockets but with a cracked head
and broken thigh and because sam
tyler who was a stranger to me had pro-
voked the fight taken on all-comers fought
a good fight and gone down without a
murmur to accept the savage punishment
that befalls the vanquished in a bar-room

brawl he went to the hospital-into
private room-and i paid the bill

  his sheepish explanation made from lips
barely visible amid a swathing of bandages
had been that he always ended a jag with
a fight but his forecastle days were over
the doctors said the thigh would always
be stiff and likely to cause pain

  so he had settled down to the com-
parative quiet of night bartender at the
ship saloon where he could get all the sea-
news and keep in touch with old friends
among whom though i knew less of sailing
than a farm hand he included me

  three men were at the bar drinking and
talking it took me some time to attract
sams attention but i was cautious because
i did not want him to be embarrassed the
next day when the police came asking after
a man of my description if witnesses should
happen to be around to call him a liar in
case he denied having seen me

  when sam found out whb it was and
got a suspicion of wny  was there he set
a bottle of whisky on the bar told his cus-
tomers to help themselves and keep tab-
the last as a perfunctory concession to his
duty-and came to the alley standing in
the half-closed door

  i told him that i thought i needed a little
sea air

  he told me that the eliza jane had
cleared the day before for sydney he could
have put me on to her and no questions
asked the northern belle was due in
ten days and he and her skipper were old
friends

  in my impatience it seemed that he
mentioned every ship that had ever been
sent down the ways to a baptism of salt
spray it seemed that he knew ali about
her movements and the personnel of her
crew who her skipper was and his char-
acter whether or not one could offer him
money for a safe passage such a pro-
fusion of sea gossip was maddening-al-
though i kept an attentive pose i didnt
understand what it meant i did not
realize that he was talking of his great
passion the sea and her ships-the strong
passion of strong men stronger than love
of women for sailors leave women in every
port to sing the ho-heave-ho of the creaking
capstan

  at last he thought of what a normal man
would have thought of the first thing
two of the three men in there drinking at
born to be hanged but-

the bar at that moment were off the jessie
darling-the mate and second officer they
were and waiting then for the captain
the jessie darling left at dawn she was
short-handed

  i protested i have an aversion to un-
necessary manual labor and i have found
very little of it that ever appealed to me as
necessary

  the jessie darling was a little schooner
recently out of copra trade in the south
seas more recently refitted and dressed
and-well he gave the history of the
jessie darling but he was rather in ig-
norance as to her future he didnt know
who owned her the mate did but the
mate had looked wise and said it was secret
perhaps he did not know ships with
secrets are fine for trouble was the infor-
mation sam gave me with a sigh as if he
had remembered a childhood sweetheart

  he swore abruptly jerked off his white
apron flung it down and declared

 im goin with you to-with me

spliced leg

  my bump of caution is enormous it
always has been large a hard blow over
the head will raise a bump and i had got
some buffetings that made caution promi-
nent in my life sam was for rushing in
with arms wide-flung and announcing that
we had decided to throw in our fortunes
with the jessie darling however he
merely introduced me as a friend and took
it for granted that i would soon come into
the conversation

  they plainly had no wish to cultivate
my acquaintance a condition that i sensed
at once and respected besides they were
all a little drunk moreover as they were
waiting for the captain i thought i might
as well wait too and make my proposition
directly to him

  they talked and drank i leaned over
the bar sipping a glass filled from the pro-
prietors own private bottle-of tea-and
let sam talk while i listened to them i
was tempted into this because they so
many times dropped their voices into fur-
tive loud whispers and did so no doubt un-
der the impression that they were concealing
what they had to say from prying ears

  caution and suspicion are two very im-
portant characteristics in my make-up
so when i chanced to hear the phrase

- old hypocrite used in a way that

seemed to refer to the captain and im-



mediately followed by a prophecy that
he would be shown i began to pay very
close attention indeed to the two mates
and the third party to whom they paid a
certain deference

  i gathered a number of things among
which that the jessie darling was likely
to steer another course than that intended
by the owner-who was also to be shown a
thing or two just what the nature of the
revelation would be i could not surmise
from what was said

  however it seemed that the jessie dar-
ling was being much sought after for
passenger purposes-the third man called
tom by the mates was also waiting to make
terms for passage with the captain the
mates were the ordinary tough-fibered big
breasted men of the sea neither of them
i judged under thirty-five

  the captain came in he was a tall
saturnine fellow with deep-set eyes and a
prominent nose and huge fists he was a
sea-going man all right grizzled furrowed
and hard

pthe atmosphere was chilled the
moment he came through the door
the look in his eyes did it the look
he fastened on the three men as he came up

  mr swanson he said frigidly why
arent you on board

  the mate replied that it was all right
that the owner himself was on board and
had him to come ashore on an errand
with a drunken snicker he added-

  hes got his girl with him

  the captain was plainly infuriated but
he kept very quiet only his eyes told
the story as he turned toward the bar
and asked for a drink swanson asked him
to drink with them but the captain coldly
declined

  mrthompson-fren o mine-doctor-
for his health d like passage said mr
swanson laboring with an introduction
and embarrassed by something more than
whisky

  i remember having heard some place-
my knowledge of the sea and its ways is
vague-that the mate though under the
direction of the captain is responsible only
to the owner and that a captain can not
dismiss a mate as he can any other member
of the crew obviously the captain dis-
liked the mate and i suppose some strong
influence kept him from summarily ridding
i

adventure

himself of swanson as it was the captain
said briefly and with decision-

   no passengers

   that was not pleasing to me

   sam tyler began to talk he rambled
 on said he used to be a sailor and was
 tired of dust and noise why it wouldnt
 take two cents for him to throw his apron
 off and go to sea again the captain asked
 a few questions a few quick nautical ques-
 tions-but i did  listen further

   behind my back i was hearing swanson
 whisper

   you come out between three an four
 ill have somebody on the lookout an stow
 you away an after we get two days

out- the mate gave the captain a

 look that indicated the events two days
 later would be highly disadvantageous to
 the captain

   ill be there said thompson

   he left

   the captain was saying to sam

   if you want to go as a boy all right
 if you are a b so much the better ill
 give you the rale soon as you make it

   they left and left me talking with the
 proprietor who grumbled and roared and
 drank something stronger than tea because
 he had been awakened from sleep to come
 down and fill the place of the bartender
 who had gone a-rambling

   in saying good-by to sam i managed to
 tell him that he would probably see me
 later but for liim to keep his eyes and ears
 open and his mouth shut

   i talked with the proprietor i let him
 think that i was going across to oakland
 and from there in an auto toward los
 angeles i dropped this information calcu-
 latinglv as if with no intention of letting
 him divine what i had in mind

   then i went to the pier from which i
 heard thompson say he would leave at
 three oclock

   i waited some time a figure moved
 into the shadows detached itself presently
 from the gloom and thompson looked into
 the muzzle of a gun gasped and raised his
 hands with that suddenness which shows
 good judgment on the part of a victim

   then i backed him into the shadows for a
 little talk

   captain whibley i told him was perhaps
 not such a fool as he appeared and since
 captain whibley did not care to have him
 on the jessie darling it would perhaps be

well to explain to me-to convince me
why i should disobey the captains wish
in the matter and let him get on board

  i dont know why it is that men always
when in a position similar to that in which
thompson found himself say the first
thing-

  who are you

  i explained-briefly-that  had net
taken the trouble of meeting him to give
information but to get il

 that - - - swansons give

me the double-cross

  dont be so quick to suspect swanson

i told him you both made the mistake
of not taking captain whibley into your
confidence

  to make a short interview still shorter
i may say i found out the day of mutiny
and piracy and treasure-trove searching
was not entirely vanished from the sea
thompson knew or said he did-had maps
anyway-where there was a pirate cache
on one of the ladrones his idea was
with the connivance of mates and crev
to take the jessie darling and find the loot
a hundred or so years old

  hunting for gold on a desert island
never appealed to me as an enticing pastime
i have gone on a treasure hunt or two but
i didnt intend to go on the jessie darling
it was one thing to be dodging the san
francisco police for a justifiable homicide
it was quite another to be dodging the
maritime police of all nations for mutiny
and piracy

  there was no doubt about the proposed
mutiny succeeding two mates and si
of the ten members of the short-handed
crew were already acquainted with the plot

  i perhaps could have won the gratitude
of captain whibley by acquainting him
with the facts but conspiring seamen are
good liars and i had nothing to prove
my tale but a few pocket-worn charts which
i removed from thompson besides atten-
tion would be attracted to my own identity
before the jessie darling cleared the bay

  once the police had their hands on me
i would be in for a trial from the lofty
heights of his bossdom thrope would put
on the pressure and if i escaped with a life
sentence i would be lucky spike delaney
could do much i did not know how much

  i did not know how much he would even
be willing to try to do for his business was
so intertwined with the police graft and so
born to be hanged but-



subject to thropes approval that friend-
ship would not be likely to count i pre-
ferred to go to sea having got to sea then
i could meet the situations as they de-
veloped

  so as often in complications of the
kind i bluffed it was easy thompson
thought captain whibley knew all about
the conspiracy the jessie darling was
sailing before sunrise

  i took possession of the maps and told
thompson it was lucky for him that
captain whibley was so anxious to sail
that he did not stay even one day over to
prefer charges against him with that i
let thompson go on his way-never to be
heard from again in my affairs-and i
found a launch and was taken out to the
ship

  the launch man did not want to put out
his lights and shut off his engine as he
approached the jessie darling but a little
money is very persuasive

  as we came alongside a low voice hailed
us-

  mr thompson

  righto i answered

  i had a speech ready in case the lookout
knew thompson but he didnt that was
obvious by the way he took it for granted
that i was he

  wheres swanson i asked

  sleepin it off he an the old man
had words ysee the owners aboard-
with his girl swansonll see you in the
mornin

  the man led me down to a stuffy little
hole i found out afterward that it was
the stewards room but the chinese
steward slept in the galley with the chinese
cook two chinamen can sleep in a
match-box and have plenty of room left

  the man left me saying he guessed hed
turn in

  his back was scarcely turned before
a low knock at the door set me tense i
had hoped for an hour or so respite
anyway

  i opened the door and sam tyler limped
in grinning

  tyler-again at sea-had been too happy
to sleep and besides he wanted to see if
i made it on board so he had sprawled
under a boat to soak in the watery air and
watch

  i made my story brief and complete
it was the truth clear down to the shooting

 of smith and the need to go on the trip
 i had only told sam before that there had
 been trouble and i needed rest

 he whistled softly and grinned

 this is goin to be good was his
 comment

 who owns this schooner i asked

 he said that he did not know he had
 asked but none of the men seemed to know

 he had heard too that the owner was
 on board with his girl

 his daughter i inquired

 dont know-maybe somebody elses
 daughter usually is on mystery ships
 whatre we goin do

 sleep i told him

v

 i did not sleep late but i lay in the
 bunk long after i had dressed i
 had nothing to do but think and i
 let thoughts come and go as it pleased
 them

 the bustling around the shouting and
 clamor the creak of the donkey-engine
 and the gentle sway of the moving ship
 pleased me we were under weigh

 a chinaman a cantonese came down
 with coffee and rice about nine oclock

 what is your name i asked

 he shook his head slightly but there
 was no expression on his face a rather old
 empty face and a chinamans face can be
 blank and empty as the inside of a scooped
 cantaloup

 you arc the steward

 he nodded slightly

 i may want to use your room for some
 time here

 i offered him a bit of money

 he took it as one takes his dues and
 without comment without expression

 cant you talk

 he looked at me hard for some seconds
 and turned away and went out saying
 nothing

 it is very easy to offend a chinaman
 but it is not easy to offend one to such an
 extent that he will show that he has been
 offended-until some time later when a
 hatchet or a knife acquaints one with the
 fact

 i had always kept out of trouble with th
 chinamen which was the more unusual be
 cause i knew many of them and was closi
 friends with seven or eight they are-


adventure

 without exception-the cleverest gamblers
 in the world anti though this is largely
 due to the fact that they are the most
 crooked they have the qualities of poise
 and bluff but excepting the cantonese
 are not particularly distinguished for what
 in the occident is regarded as courage

  they prefer to meet a man from behind
rather than to his face a saxon doesnt feel
that he has paid an enemy unless that
enemy knows who has struck him to death
but a chinamans soul and the soul of
almost any oriental is satisfied with poison
or a blow from the dark

  about noon swanson came down

  i dont know what he was intending to
say but i imagine something indicative
of surprize he got his surprize from
another angle

  in about twenty words i gave him a
calling down that he could not soon forget
pointing out that he was a fine fellow to
put any faith in-to go to bed drunk when
important work was to be done why had
he not been on deck to meet thompson
and me when we came why had he
waited until half the day was gone before
coming near me a fine fellow to have to
trust

  where was thompson

  if he swanson had not been drunk
and asleep when we came he might have
learned

  yes i was the man that had loafed
around in the ships bar i was also the
man who was a friend of the bartenders
i was the man who had something on
thompson and i had impressed upon
thompson the need of taking me into the
game swanson was invited to notice
that sam tvler was on board and he was
invited to consider the matter of going
on with the game under the new deal or
trying to get out and save his own hide
jn which case he would probably share
the fate of the captain of whom we mu-
tineers would soon dispose

  the lookout had not told him thompson
came with me

  of course the lookout hadnt the
lookout knew nothing he had said the
mate was asleep and i had known that
meant in a drunken sleep so the launch
had gone back without thompson coming
on deck thompson did not intend to
come on deck anyway he would have
explained from the launch

  the mate was mystified but when i
showed the maps he realized that i had
got pretty close into the confidence of
thompson and if i had not intended to
go on with the plot why had i not carried
my story straight to the captain

  my procedure was a bit irregular but
effective he was nervous uneasy but
convinced besides swanson hated the
captain

  what about thompson

  i suggested that thompson had seen fit
to sell out his interest in the plan to me
that certain persuasions had been made
which appealed to thompson as irresistible
that whenever i saw a good thing i natu-
rally wanted to share

  is it or is it not a go i demanded

  he seemed to think i had the cards
pretty well stacked besides he wanted
to even a grudge against the captain and
he believed in the map a sailor always
believes in a treasure-lrove map this
one may liave been genuine for all that
i know

  it was never used so all things con-
sidered and perhaps convinced that i would
be as firm a leader as thompson he declared
that it was a go and offered his hand

  i ignored the hand and told him that
he had better walk a straight line that
made him angry of course but i had a
better card up my sleeve than he suspected
to keep him from trying to do away with
me and getting the maps

  look here i said i know what is
going on inside your head here are the
maps-three of them i have copies i
have concealed them when you find
them-the copies-it will be time to slug
me over the head and drop me over the side
but not before remember the copies-
very accurately made-are all that is left

  with that i struck a match and burned
the maps under his nose while his mouth
hung agape

  there are a half-dozen desperate fel-
lows i explained lest his slow brain did not
fully appreciate the peril in which i had
placed him enlisted by thompson on
this boat they expect to go after gold
the ship cant be worked without them
you arc their ringleader if they find out
you cant produce the maps your life wont
be worth a salted herring-and you cant
produce the maps if anything should
happen to me thats all
born to be hanged but-



  i deliberately turned my back that he
might see how little i cared for the boiling
anger that reddened his face and heaved
his chest i dont think he noticed that
i could watch him very well out of the
corners of my eyes in the small mirror
that hung on the bulkhead

  as i have said i am very cautious
when i seem to be taking a chance i am
usually playing safe-dealing from the
bottom of the deck

  he contained his anger and went out
i supposed he wished my soul on the
toasting fork of his satanic majestys chief
cook but mr swanson had given himself
a little lesson in self-control perhaps he
did not play poker except in the crude
draw-and-bet manner of the win-or-be-
broken gambler and so urffierstood nothing
of the refinements of bluff

the chinese steward brought me
something for dinner withered
and wise and rather old he was
and i imperturbably tried further con-
versation with him and received no
answer he watched me with a steady
scrutiny not at all reassuring-but one
cant tell what is reassuring or ominous
in a chinaman

  by night my hole had become unbearably
wearisome

  the chinaman visited me again but
i paid no attention to him but he seemed
to me to hesitate to linger however he
did nothing said nothing and went away

  i waited until it was dark then went
on deck to stretch my legs i was of the
opinion that i had been a little impetuous
in coming on board the jessie darling
the situation was by no means clear the
future not reassuring it would be wrong
to suggest that i was afraid

  when i get into a fix from which my wit
and guns can not extricate me then it
is time to die-and as long as i am not shot
from behind my ghost will hold no grudge
against the man that sends me across the
border i was not afraid but the need
for having left san francisco did not seem
so pressing a score of leagues from the
golden gate on a ship pledged to mutiny

  it was no easy matter to stretch my legs
for the moon was bright and dodged in
and out among the clouds in a way that
annoyed me i had not yet got what
sailormen call my bearings the moon

made little difference in that though i
knew nothing of ships i did not leam
much about the jessie darling either i
was kept too busy

  as i stood identifying myself as much as
possible with a mast shadow i heard voices
excited voices aft then a pattering of feet
a figure scooted by me and shouted down a
doorway

  turn out an search the ship woman
hid-or overboard

  i had been given to understand the ship
was short-handed it seemed overcrowded
to me voices harsh laughter and harder
jokes rose in every direction figures
scampered by some with lanterns calls
rang to and fro from the poop-deck
i could hear the voice of captain whibley
questions and answers and directions-
and jokes-all around and reports a
man came by and hashed a lantern in my
face it was the man who had been de-
tailed by swanson to let me-or rather
thompson-on board

  i made inquiries

  he said she rriust have jumped over-
board sam tyler had been at the wheel
and said he saw her come up and go down
amidships later he heard a splash-
thought he did listened but there was no
outcry looked but saw nothing sup-
posed maybe it was only a porpoise or
something must have been her ship
was searched high and low no trace
old man was furious-the captain that is

  was having words with the owner
cussin him out old man could cuss
some he could seems like she wasnt

the owners daughter but- and wasnt

that kind of a woman after all seemed
like shed been half-drunk or something
when she come on board and sick saw
what she was into-and jumped

  who is the owner

  dont know sir aint the owner after
all old man- heard him-says youre

a - liar this boat is owned by john

collins they cussed back and forth
owner a big man with- the seaman
swiped his cheeks to indicate a beard and
added black 

  i was hot with anger but i couldnt
help anything i could do nothing i let
women strictly alone because-well i like
them when they are not interfering with
me when they are at a distance on other
mens arms but i dont like to know of


adventure

their being mistreated i am cruel and at
times cold-blooded but i dont want to
see anybody cruel to women children or
dogs i was never put to the test but i
believe that i could without troublesome
regret shoot a man who beat a dog

  i know i would if it was a stray that had
ever poked its nose into my hand and
dogs are third on the list-though perhaps
children are first-of the things it is not
wise to abuse if my gun is not empty in
fact i might be tempted in that case to
overcome a strong aversion to using my
fists on somebodys face

  i reflected that it was perhaps well that
i had been on deck when the search was
made somebody might have found me
in the stewards hole-though i later heard
that the steward had made his own report
and reported nothing

  i judged that i had better get out of the
way in case somebody might take enough
interest in my presence to carry a tale to
the captain though i understood later
most of the crew knew i had taken thomp-
sons place

  i went to the hole it was dark i
struck a match and lighted the lantern
it was a cubbyhole of a place the bunk
occupied almost a half of it the lantern
was smoky and dim and flickered i stood
for a moment listening at the door there
was nothing to attract attention

  i closed the door and sat down and for a
moment rather fascinated watched the
lantern it was spluttering away as if
embarrassed i loosed my shoes and
placed them carefully by the chair i am
methodical i removed my collar and tie
and reached forward to the little shelf
under the lantern i unbuttoned my vest-
and stopped

  there was some kind of a noise-only
it wasnt loud enough to be a noise my
muscles became tense and the cold rigidly
icy contraction that always grips my body
at the first whisper of alarm and makes
me appear so nerveless and calm took hold
of me

you cant stay here please
im here

i jerked my head back over my
shoulder a womans face peered up out
of the shadows from under the covers of my
bunk

  i turned around in my chair and looked

at her i could not see her face very
clearly i said nothing for a few moments
what is there one can say in a situation
of the kind i could not gallantly offer
to withdraw myself i had no place else
to go on the ship i had as good reasons
as she for wishing to keep out of sight
so i looked hard and long and my eyes
cleared a little and became accustomed to
darkness

  she was in that bunk with the covers
so ingeniously arranged that it would
have taken more than a casual glance to
tell that anybody was in it there was
no outline of the body visible the covers
had been drawn and bolstered evenly
only her face showed and she only just
before had drawn the cover from over it
obviously she  could not have made so
ingenious arrangement of them herself-
even if she had blundered accidentally into
the room

  who put you there i asked

  the steward

  that chinaman

  yes

  there is no telling anything about a
chinaman

  a pause i looked at her hard my
back was against the light-what there was
of it at last i was convinced so i
said-

  well miss curwen how did you come
to be on the jessie darling

  she flung off the covers and sat upright
agitated partly frightened

  then you are that man i thought so-
but-but you are in jail

  let us not get excited i said sooth-
ingly-or tried to say it soothingly youre
supposed to be overboard and  seem sup-
posed to be in jail how do vou account
for it

  she told mev

  i have found that it is usually wisest
to show surprize when you dont feel it
to pretend ignorance when you havent it-
and the reverse too so i did not seem
surprised or appear to have heard anything
not already very well known to me

  miss helen curwen was of the slim dark
type that are full of passions and wilfulness

  all women like to do things they have
no business to do but not all of them lack
discretion or as a woman might call it if
she is one of the kind that does do those
things the courage the average woman
born to be hanged but-

 

feels that the world is cheating her being
filled with infinitely more desires dreams
or whatever her urgent restlessness may be
called than can ever be gratified she lives
under a continual sense of repression-
until at such a time as with a kind of
volcanic folly she breaks loose

  the breaking loose may take the form
of tearing up a dress that she really likes
of throwing a scalding coffee pot at her
husbands head or of throwing herself at
some man mother and friends have warned
her against incidentally a sure way
to make a normal girl interested in if not
in love with a man-if he has any per-
sonality good looks or suavity at all-is
to try to tell her that he is dangerous
color his reputation with black call him
those names that are sufficient to make him
an outcast from society

  let those who willingly make a study of
the sex explain if they can why this is so
all or at least most of my experiences with
women have been against my will my
knowledge of them has usually come from
some such inescapable contact as discover-
ing one of them ensconced in my bed from
which-as in this case literally and in
others figuratively so to speak-they poke
their heads to order me out of my own
room

  in this case i went promptly having
found out some things of a really surprizing
nature

  i went to the galley and roused the
steward

  he looked at me steadily quietly but
said nothing he made no reply to my
demand to know why he had stowed the
woman in my bunk and i am sure that
he did not smile though there were so
many wrinkles in his face that i could
not be positive about this he said
nothing

  i told him what i wanted and without
suggesting a threatening manner conveyed
to him that an easy way out would be to do
it i do not believe it is ever wise to
threaten a chinaman kill him if the
situation requires-but threaten no his
duplicity is so subterranean that he doesnt
seem to hear the threat at all though he
is likely to accept it as a challenge to mortal
combat and win by poison subsequently
delivered with the humblest of smiles

  if he is a cantonese he is more likely
to use a dagger gently slipping it between

your ribs while you look upward to some
spot on the ceiling or to some cloud effect
that his esthetic perception points out
i am not certainly not a coward but
i never felt comfortable with strange
chinamen or any women

  he said nothing but when i had finished
he bowed and led the way

  i followed

  he indicated a door stepped back and
hesitated

  i made a gesture of dismissal and added
a whispered-

  thank you

  gently as gently as if screwing the lid
from an infernal machine i tried the door
it was not locked

  cautiously slowly soundlessly i opened
it inch by inch imperceptibly i opened it
and when it was wide open i stood in
the doorway and waited-waited for the
man who sat in a kind of heavy resignation
his face down his arm thrown back over
the chair and a tall half-emptied glass of
whisky in his hand to look up

  he did

i like to make dramatic entrances
when the opportunity affords i
like it for two reasons one is that
perhaps i am by nature a little theatrical
though certainly not melodramatic-there
cant be melodrama anyway without love
of woman the other and more sensible
reason is that such an entrance is almost
like a terrific nerve-bomb for the other
person

  my- he muttered every muscle

frozen in fright his mouth open his eyes
staring in widened horror

  i said nothing

  the light was good but an oil light and
with the shadows of the passageway behind
me perhaps i did take on a rather spectral
effect in his crazed brain the ship a
wooden ship with long steady rolls veered
from side to side groaning and creaking
as if built of dead mens bones

  he swerved abruptly around in his chair
dropping unnoticingly the glass which fell
and splintered and continued to stare
at me

  he passed his hands over his eyes to
wipe out the vision but flesh and blood
like mine doesnt vanish so easily

  you he said at last in something be-
tween a hiss and prayer


adventure

   yes thrope youve guessed it i said
stepping inside and closing the door without
taking my eyes from him

  perhaps he wanted to fight but he is
not greatly to be blamed for not attempting
it i offered no menace cxcept such
menace as he may have read in my face
but if he read anything there his eyes were
better than my effort to show no expression
unless an inscrutable lack of feeling and
purpose may in itself be called an ex-
pression the tips of my fingers were in
the side pockets of my coat there was no
threat in face or manner

  you you were-arrested

   he half asked it half declared it that is
he was having difficulty in reconciling the
conflicting evidence between his ears and
his eyes between what he seemed to have
heard and what he seemed now to see

  arrested what for i asked inno-
cently

  they told me they had you-or would

have-or-

  then suddenly anxious to charge me
with a great crime-

  you killed a man

  oh did i thrope you seem to have
me mixed with some one else

  i was not playing i was tormenting him
the realities of the world the things one
knows and has heard on land take on
almost misty distance a sort of nebulous
mirage if their existence is contradicted
at night in mid-ocean when the slup is
devoid of human sounds particularly when
the ship groans and wails-and a woman
has just flung herself overboard or which
is just as effective is thought to have
done so

  you did he shouted at me saying
it loudly to convince himself you killed
smith delaney was crazy because-be-
cause- his voice trailed off indecisive-
ly then strengthened by a new idea he
added-because it happened at his place

  i understood thrope did not want me
to know that delaney was indignant
furious because a frame-up had been
planted against me-and especially so be-
cause it had been pulled off in his place

  no thrope would not want me to know
that he would not want to believe it
himself delaney was a power a political
power he led the underworld to the polls
it was delaney who knew best how to
stuff and steal in a doubtful election and

thrope was anxious to be governor he
would not want delaney to be angry even
though he could shake much of the profit
out of delaneys business and graft still
who could handle votes like delaney

  if i had known precisely as i did then
where delaney stood and how angry he
was at the frame-up i might have lain low
and remained in san francisco not putting
much faith in delaney but so to speak
less distrust but that was all behind me
thrope and i were together on the high
seas

  i looked the cabin over admiringly it
was capacious and beautifully furnished
so the jessie darling was something of a
pleasure yacht

  a bottle of whisky and a piece of paper
were on the table at which thrope sat

  how did you get here he demanded
then quickly-wont you have a drink

  i read his thoughts-not his thought
either but his intonations and expressions-
as plainly as if he had put them into precise
words between asking how i got there
and the proffer of a glass of whisky it had
occurred to him that if deftly managed
i could be arrested on the ship stowed away
and carried back to stand trial

  the main thing of course in his mind
was to keep me from shooting before help
could arrive i think that he was almost
beginning to believe that fortune had played
into his hands

  as he turned to pour out whisky for me
his eye fell on the piece of folded paper
with a movement intended to be un-
obstrusive he placed his hand over it and
with a very awkward effort at doing nothing
suspicious was earn ing it to his pocket

  something i would be interested in

i inquired innocently

  what and again and blusteringly
as he rammed it into his pocket-what

  thrope was given to blustering he
seemed to think noise was strength the
world would be full of samsons were it true

  let me share your confidence thrope
i said extending a hand of which the fore-
finger beckoned slightlv

  of all the-

  impudence yes let me see that
paper

  its personal i-i-its personal

  i replied that i didnt care if it were
intimate or what it might be that i was
a very curious individual
born to be hanged but-

 

  have a drink we might as well make
it up he offered evasively

  i said nothing i looked at him steadily
in about three seconds he handed me the
paper

  you keep both hands on the table and
turn your face the other way i instructed

  he hesitated but did as told i did not
want him jumping at me while i was read-
ing i wouldnt greatly have minded
having him do so if i had not already been
in certain complications that would have
become more embarrassing through having
to explain how i happened to shoot million-
aire thrope candidate for governor-and
likely to le elected

  i glanced at the letter and i came as
near to feeling shame as ever i can but
i began and read it i read it carefully
it was astounding

  the envelope-the envelope i said

  you know to whom its addressed-
youve read it before he replied half
leering at me

fjjl it would have been useless to
l  deny the charge i had not read
  before i had not even been able
to identify it as that letter-but i had had
suspicions so i asked for the envelope
i really did not care whether he gave it
to me for he had given me its equivalent
in his remark

  perhaps i should have destroyed the
letter i find in looking back over my
years however that i have seldom done
the sensible thing at crucial moments
i have done the safe thing or tried to
i had some influence over thrope as long
as i kept the letter

  he would have given a foot leg and all
to get it again besides i rather looked
to mrs curwen to feel more relieved if
she destroyed it herself-rather than heard
even from me that it was destroyed i
could too understand her hesitation in
ever destroying it a letter of the kind
is not the sort that a woman would ever
destroy-and then not without committing
it to memory

  i put it into my pocket

  name your price said thrope

  i prefer to auction it i told him
congressman bryan is not a rich man
but he has friends then too a woman
may want to bid-and have nothing but
tears did you ever try to bid against a

womans tears thrope what in -

would you have to offer then

  of course he didnt know of what i was
talking all that got into his head was
the idea that i was going to auction the
letter

  he became excited and offered-it is
useless to repeat his insane sums anyway
he never expected to pay them so he could
afford to talk in large numbers he never
expected me to get off the ship with the
letter all he feared was that i might
destroy it

  by the way thrope who was the
woman that went overboard-to get away
from you

  i am all the time discovering that though
most men are better than the world thinks
yet some of whom i have the lowest opinion
are worse even than i could have imagined

i dont like to repeat his exact words but
i believe it necessary nothing else that the
man ever did or said so vividly illuminated
the utter meanness and subtlety within
him

  had i not known the facts even i-whq
was rather a sophisticated and suspicious
youngster-would scarcely have doubted
the truth though i might have had con-
tempt for his callousness he said with a
kind of careless regret

  her oh a tommy i picked up on the
coast she was full of hop and got away
from me-jumped the cabin when i wasnt
looking

   a silence

  i dont think that i showed that i doubted
him i merely waited nothing so much
as silence nothing so much as pause
jangles the nerves of even the hardened
guilty

  then quietly i remarked-

  helen curwen never impressed me as a
girl like that

  an explosion went off inside of him
for a third of a second he looked as if
he was literally blowing up he jumped
and quivered in every muscle

  this governor-to-be was rather im-
plicated in sometliing more than mere
scandal-he did not care for mere scandal-
if i should tell my story to the public he
could lie yes his friends could he a
mere outcast girl could have been pretty
well disposed off by lies but there were
men courageous enough to investigate
the facts concerning a reputable daughter


adventure

or the daughter of a reputable woman and
there is one thing that constantly reassures
my faith in democracies

   their publics never forgive at the polls
the debauchery of young girls of girls out
of homes the public will smirk and smile
and say oh well no men are saints if a
politician is merely a rounder-but let him
even be suspected of having invaded the
sanctuary of the hearthstone-neither
money lies nor stolen votes can save him

  but of course thrope had the drop
on me figuratively-or thought that he
had even if i got off the jessie darling
alive i could be turned over to the police
isolated by them prevented from being
communicated with any but attorneys
of thropes own choosing tried before a
judge he held to heel and by a jury of the
courts own choosing convicted of smiths
murder sent to san quentin or hanged
without ever a chance to tell my story
or if i did tell it to have it reach none
but ears of the cabals own choosing

  things like that had been done in san
-irancisco they have been done in every
city at some time or other thrope knew
all about the effectiveness of such pro-
cedure what he did not fully appreciate
was my aversion to putting myself into the
hands of justice

   much of my inveterate dislike of police
and courts and all the machinery of law
much of my often foolhardy efforts to play
a lone game do what i think is right even
to lawlessness may be traced as having
had an origin in the experiences and knowl-
edge of what murderous farces were per-
petrated around me in my youth

   helen curwen he lied who is she

  the girl was supposed to be dead and
i suppose he had thought there were none
to identify her none who recognized her
or knew her until i admitted a certain
familiarity with his newest closet-gkeleton

   a friend of mine i said

   how did you get on my ship

   he was angry but he was doing his best
not to show it perhaps he was wondering
again as he may have wondered before
just how ready  am to shoot

  a fellow who had led my kind of life
and who has on occasion shot has his
reputation magnified and distorted but
such distortion has a wholesome effect on
men like thrope

   supposing i suggested ignoring his

question we call in captain whibley
thrope swore and wanted to know if
that-oh i dont remember how many

kinds of-something or other-man had

let me on this private ship which so thrope
said belonged to him

  let the captain speak for himself he
didnt impress me as a man who would
lie easily

vi

captain whibley came in he
was big with a gaunt dark face a
very direct man the captain

  he asked in so many words who i was
what i was doing on board his ship and
his general attitude was unfavorable

  thrope fairly bounded to his chance i
was perfectly willing that he should play
his hand first

  he told the captain but not without
having edged into a position almost putting
the captain nearest my gun-in case i
drew-that i was a dirty tin-horn gambler
wanted for murder and that i had evi-
dently slipped on board the jessie darling
to escape the police that i was trying to
bluff him thrope with a cock-and-bull
story about having known the girl-or
rather of having pretended that she came
from a good home and wasnt a barbary
coast creature

  probably the girl was something to me
probably she had helped me on board
thrope therefore ordered the captain to
place me in irons and as owner of the
ship furthermore ordered him to go about
and head for san francisco

  i have told you once before said
captain whibley slowly deliberately and
with evident aversion for thrope that
collins is the only owner i recognize
collins is -only a bookkeeper for me
im thrope thomas thrope

  i know that said whibley but if
you were king of england i would be the
captain of my own ship-at sea and sail
her as my owner directed

  thrope was set back he looked it
but his spirit soon rose whibley was a
firm man and turned his attention to me
you are armed

  i barely nodded

  put your gun on the table

  i barely shook my head

  you heard me say put your gun on
that table 
bom to be hanged but-



  captain whibley was a strong man in a
way that a man is by his personality power-
ful it was only with a psychological effort
that i refused

  no captain-not yet ill break the
gun and give it to you at the proper time
but i may want to plug that skunk without
having to search around for something
to do it with

  evidently he sympathized with my feel-
ing toward thrope and perhaps too he
recognized that i would not give up the gun

  what do you mean he asked firmly
but inquiringly rather than challengingly

  did you see the girl at all

  yes i saw her she was very beauti-
ful he said it simply

  i did not tell the captain all i knew
helen would not tell him all she had told
me thrope would not tell all that he
knew either then i did not know so
much as i thought i did--not even after
having read the letter which was carefully
deposited in my own pocket

   i will try to be brief for important things
happened later on

  the captain went to helen himself he
questioned her but not as a sea captain
might have been expected to do by those
who have rarely met the type of whibley
he was a strong and lonely man with a fine
sense of justice and an implacable honor

  he returned where i kept vigil over
thrope and what he told thrope did
my heart good with dignity without
profanity with something of religious in-
dignation but no mention of god-for
after all such manhood as whibleys is a
higher religion than the maundering eye-
rolling of the self-consciously holy who can
do nothing decent without calling his
attention to their merits-captain whibley
told the man of millions the literal owner
of that ship the man powerful and un-
scrupulous enough to wreck any captains
career exactly what kind of a dog he was
and whibley said that as soon as the jessie
darling reached port the full story of the
affair would be made public

  and ill ruin you yelled thrope

  i touched thrope on the shoulder it
was something a little more than a touch
perhaps for he wheeled involuntarily and
looked into my face

  you forget i reminded him that
my affairs have first claim  your atten-
tion

  it was then that thrope appealed to
captain whibley to have me disarmed
whibleys sense of justice required him to
make demands for the gun i gave on
over to him

  he has another shouted thrope

  the captain asked if that was true he
said to hand it over i refused politely
as possible the captain furious at this
defiance of authority reached for the one
 had laid  the tabic but i threw back
the breast of my coat and with a slight
jerk of my wrist he was covered

  i apologized but i was insistent in
fact i reached out and recovered the other
gun

  i was sorry for captain whibley i liked
him i would have liked him less had he
not been so determined to disarm me he
had no fear but turned his back on me
and walked from the cabin

  thrope and i were alone but we did not
talk that is he talked but i scarcely
listened he was offering peace he was
suggesting an offensive and defensive
alliance if that story which whiblej
had declared was for the public shoulc
reach its destination-thropes political
honors would go glimmering if his political
influence would not be entirely destroyed

  swanson and four men came to the cabin
door their orders were to disarm and
bind me but i-i merely pointed toward
thrope and said-

  thats the man

  with rough summary hands they searched
him and found nothing of firearms the
bound him in spite of his raving protest-
and stowed him on the bunk

  i rummaged through thropes effects
and found a gun i removed one of my
own took the shells from the two of them
and told swanson to take them and the
report to whibley

  the men knew very well that they had
not been sent to lie up thrope but as a
chief conspirator and a ringleader of the
proposed mutiny which was already due
i was immune from their violence

ygk that is i was immune just then
that night sam tyler gave me the
ship news first helen curwen
had been given other quarters than those
offered by the steward and placed under
the protection of captain whibley

  tyler had been at the wheel early in the


adventure

evening when helen frightened and des-
perate rushed from the companionway
and asked where was the steward the
chinese steward

  he promised to help me to hide me
tell them you saw me jump she waved
a frantic hand toward the black molten
water

  tyler thought she was fleeing from a dog
to a snake by running from a white man
to a yellow man the average chinaman
may be trusted implicitly any place but
at a gambling-table and with a woman
but this old silent steward was of a different
fiber than most men white or yellow

  but the important thing that tyler told
me was that the mates swanson and the
second officer were spreading the feeling
among the ruffians that there was no
reason for allowing me to cut on their
treasure trove

  that meant a certain danger but i do
not mind admitting that i welcomed it

  my room had been searched and i had
been watched swanson wanted to find
the copies of the maps perhaps he thought
i had too much sense to keep them on my
person as that would probably be the first
place anybody would have the first impulse
to look perhaps he and his men would
have tried to overpower me to search me
when so ordered by the captain but tyler
had spread my name and reputation-and
tyler had a vivid imagination too that
name and reputation was not unknown to
some of them moreover i had in that
cabin given them no chance to take me off
my guard a man has to use up about
half of his lifes blood writing a record of
loyalty and true faith before i trust him
i liked tyler for instance i believed in
him but i wouldnt have trusted him very
far-though so far as i ever learned he was
as good a friend as a man could want

  i play a lone game-go just as far alone
as it is possible

  it was well into the morning when i lay
down again in the stewards cubbyhole
i did not undress for dawn would come in
an hour and i wanted to be up and see
what was going on though i had nothing
in particular in mind to do

  i did not go to sleep there was too
much movement about not too much to
disturb sleep but too much to disturb the
peace of mind of one suspicious as myself
feet were shuffling about voices muttering

  a quiet rap came on my door

  i started to answer but caught the words
back the approach to the door had been
rather stealthy i would wait the door
opened whispers there was more than
one person there my name was softly
called i did not answer

  i was lying on my left side my hand
touched the handle of the gun that nestled
in a skeleton holster on my stomach  i
was ready-or thought i was but a terrific
blow fell through the darkness and nearly
shattered my right shoulder i was at
once almost smothered beneath the weight
of men i can shoot as well with my left
as with my right hand

  this dexterity has been acquired by the
left hand after long effort chiefly because
it is the right hand that fellows looking for
an excuse to shoot first watch but i
could use neither i was in a bad way and
very foolishly struggled a few years ago
a similar surprize was made on me and i
pretended to be unconscious and presently
two of my assailants were themselves un-
conscious-permanently so but in that
cabin i struggled foolishly and i was
choked and beaten and gouged and it
seemed as if my clothes were being literally
torn from me

  there is nothing nothing that can be
done to me personally that is so infuriating
as for people to paw me i dont want
anybodys hands to touch me at any time
and when i am manhandled my temper
swells up like the poisonous throat of a
cobra but my gun had been taken away
and i have no doubt but that the handle
of it is what some fellow used to strike me
on what he thought was the head but
which was only my already pained shoulder

  i have never been knocked unconscious
more than two or three times in my life
that was one of them

  when i came to i found the old withered
steward staring down into my face in
his hand he held a tumbler of brandy
much of it had been poured on my face
and some of it trickled between my teeth
and i felt almost strangled i dont know
how long he had worked with me but he
seemed to think his duties had just
begun

  he offered me the rest of the brandy but
said nothing

  why dont you talk i demanded

  he opened his mouth he was a mute
born to be hanged but-



at some time or other his tongue had been
cut out in china precautions are taken
to keep secrets

  on board the jessie darling yang li
and i became friends eventually in years
that followed we were to become brothers
i was to find that for cunning and loyalty
that chinaman was incomparable why
he had taken a fancy to me then i do not
know i never did know not even
chinese wizardry could foretell that some
months later my gun was to clear his trail
of enemies but that does not belong to
this story

  i was washed and bandaged my body
was sore but i was not weak i was
furious but as my ferocity is never emo-
tional i said little and displayed patience

  i asked if he knew who had attacked me
he did i repeated what names i knew
but he nodded at one only swansons

  i was unarmed he offered me a long
knife refined of edge to a razors sharpness
i took it though what i know of handling
a knife is about the same as any other man
knows-nothing except to grasp the handle
and thrust a knife in the hand of an
expert is about the deadliest weapon
made

  i ask him if he thought he could steal
the gun of mine that had been given the
captain the night before he shook his
head and tried to tell me something im-
portant

  the mutineers had broken loose but it
was not a mutiny according to the previous
plan thrope wanted to turn back to san
francisco he was the owner of the ship
he was rich his name was known to
every man he was the big boss-and
he was to give them protection for putting
back and later so he promised to fit them
out with a ship of their own for the gold
hunt

  the upshot of the tiling was that i had
been attacked and left for dead not so
much to secure the maps which i was sup-
posed to have as to secure the letter which
thrope wanted events had taken a sud-
den whirl

  i learned all that later yang tried to
tell me but he was not very successful
he could write a bit of english but i found
it hard to read his writing however he
did make it clear to me that i had been
thrown overboard

  yang tyler and another seaman had

dumped overboard a form  made of a
blanket and weighted with bricks out of
the galley

  captain whibley badly wounded was
barricaded in his cabin with helen curwen
the captain was no coward and he was
armed but he did not stand a chance
swanson wanted to kill him and intended
to especially as thrope had much the same
wish with whibley dead and myself over-
board thrope and the crew could tell any
kind of a story and have it believed
thrope was not the sort of man who would
hesitate to take such measures as seemed
necessary to silence helen

  the situation was rather twisted

  yang painfully wrote out the question-

you kill him

  i found he meant swanson i told him
that i would take pleasure in relieving swan-
son of further earthly troubles at the first
opportunity

  but yang protested he made me under-
stand that it would be a particular favor to
him if he were allowed the pleasure of set-
tling with mr swanson

  can you use this thing i asked hold-
ing up the long lean knife

  he snatched it up his wrist was like a
swivel his arm flashed in and out and up
and down balanced on his toes his thin
body swayed right and left ducked with
dazzling rapidity the long blade played with
thrust and feint then he stopped abruptly
and held his arm upraised poised to throw

  i guess you had better keep it i told
him bring me a meat cleaver or some-
thing i know more about

  he took my half-jesting words at face
value i was furnished with a heavy
cleaver

vii

 sthe day passed

  the crew naturally got drunk

  it was quiet weather scarcely more
than a breath on the ocean-and no reason
for staying sober the sails were drooped
the wheel made fast and the jessie darling
meandered lazily

  tyler wa drunk too i suppose he had
had to show good fellowship with the muti-
neers but my private opinion is that he
did not try very hard to evade drunken-
ness


adventure

  i was patient when there is no need for
hurry i can be extraordinarily patient
besides i had a headache and my body was
sore i waited for night

  night came

  yang li led the way but he remained
behind me when the door opened and once
more i stood waiting for thrope to recog-
nize me

  thrope and swanson were drinking to-
gether what agreements and plans they
were making i have no way of knowing
they sprang up swanson with a yell as he
saw me half naked and bandaged-a big
cleaver in my hand

  i was in earnest and i meant it when i
said-

  up with your hands

  why people think it is only a gun that
commands the respect of uplifted hands i
do not know a sober man would have had
better sense than swanson thrope drunk
as he was raised his hands but swanson
attempted to pull a gun-my gun-from
the holster he had fastened on his hip

  he was slow as though untying a knot i
leaned forward to strike-but a streak of
steel z-zz-zzzipped past my head the thirsty
point of that flexible blade went into swan-
sons throat and pierced through his neck
whence the thin wrists of yang li got such
driving power i do not know

  swanson went over backward his hands
clawing at the knife his head in falling
struck the bulkhead and he scarcely
moved

  thrope gasped something about it being
me-again

  i told him that neither jails nor davy
jones locker seemed able to hold me

  they hang men for aiding a mutiny i
told him the federal government-not
the tenderloin judges

  i knew there was no chance of him ever
being hanged but i might as well give him
something to think over when he would be
alone i wanted him to do much thinking
because i had qn idea that this altair would
have to end in a compromise all the way
round

  i trussed thrope up tightly painfully
tight in fact i wanted him to have plenty
to think of something more than mere
deviltry

  from that time on i worked quick

  the man who stood a drunken guard over
captain whibleys door and no doubt kept

awake only by cursing the captain and
making remarks unfit for the ears of any
woman especially of her who was on the
other side of the door went down with a
hole in his head he happened to have
been one of those who had pounded me or
he might have fared better

  the two mates left johnson and a young
fellow by the name of robbins were
alarmed by the shot and came to investi-
gate robbins was the fuller of fight-and
there was a chance of his surviving if he
should be removed directly to a hospital as
soon as we reached san francisco

  johnson did the discreet thing and sur-
rendered

  with a rope end in one hand and the gun
in the other i went on deck yang and the
cook followed but they carried water a
form that the rope could bring sufficiently
to consciousness to understand what had
happened was doused with water

  three fellows of the drunken group
around the capstan were sober enough to
fight no time was wasted in argument
it was stand to attention with a respectful
sir or get hurt and the man who threw a
marlin-spike at me from the rear served as
an object lesson for those sober enough to
realize what happened to him

  i found tyler peacefully snoozing with
his head in a bucket no doubt the bucket
had originally served as a pillow i gave
him some attention from the rope end and
knocked him down with the butt of the gun
when he came up fighting mad

  thank gord its you i wouldnt take
it off no other feller he said as he sat on
the deck and rubbed his head to see how
big the bump was

  i told him that j did not know any more
about working a ship than i knew of ping-
pong but if he would give the orders i
would see that they were carried out

  it was a drunken and sullen lot that
turned to but they knew very well that i
did not carry a gun as an ornament when
they seemed sober enough to understand
that what i was saying was not out of any
fear of them i let it be known that the
chances of their being prosecuted for mu-
tiny when they reached port-if they did
their work well in the meantime-were
rather slim

  i was perhaps taking a good deal on to
myself in holding out that hope but i have
been accustomed to taking a good deal on
bom to be hanged but-



to myself at various times and i knew very
well what i was about on the jessie dar-
ling

  then-but not until the ship was under
discipline-i went to the captains cabin
i made myself known through the door and
with some hesitancy it was opened bv
helen the captain was rather badly
wounded and lay on the bed covering the
door with a gun

  i told him that i had made a mistake in
refusing to give up my gun to him that the
mutineers had taken it anyway so i had
been reduced to a cleaver reinforced by a
very clever knife-fighter

      whibley had a broken thigh-i
think it was the thigh anyway it
was something above his knee that
overcame even his saturnine determination
to stand upright and walk he did not com-
plain he did not make a whimper and
though he pushed away helen when she
offered help in the futile solicitious way of a
woman touched by the sight of pain he did
it with a strange gentleness there was no
doubt as to how she regarded him

  he asked bluntly if i had killed thrope

  i told him my story helen had already
told him hers i do not think she told him
the contents of the letter-but she men-
tioned it in my presence

  i left the cabin so abruptly that they must
have thought i had suddenly gone mad

  high and low i searched for that letter
it contained a secret a womans secret-
more than a womans secret really the
destiny of more than one person it is an
awful thing to find the decisive factor of a
persons destiny put down on a little bit of
paper that may be shifted from hand to
hand and i was determined to get it if pos-
sible

  it was not possible the body of swan-
son had been put overboard the seamen
had plundered his pockets-as is not un-
usual i believe among such men as will try
a mutiny when one of their number goes
down but there was no getting trace of the
letter

  i questioned thrope who writhed in pain
in obvious pain but he denied all knowl-
edge of the letter for one of the few times
in my life i was deceived by a mans lies-
deceived when i looked right at him but
i was deceived though not so much that i
neglected to search him and to search his

cabin however i believed the letter was
gone there was every reason to think that
it had gone either overboard with swanson
or been cast aside unthinkingly by any one
of the crew that chanced to imd it

  i had a talk with thrope and we came
to an understanding

  he was to forget that i shot and killed
his imported gunman smith a gambler and
dead-shot from seattle brought down for
the express purpose of running me out of
san francisco as an aid to his forgetful-
ness he wrote out and signed a statement
to the effect that he had often heard smith
say he would kill me that thrope had
paid smith to do this did not appear in the
statement but it was a sufficiently strong
statement to give me evidence of self-de-
fense

  of course its real importance lay in the
fact that so long as i had it thrope would
bring pressure to bear to keep me from
being arrested and tried-or at least con
victed

  in return i was to say nothing about his
damnable conduct toward helen curwen i
was tempted to this less for my own safety
than on her own behalf though i also had
captain whibley in mind

  the situation was simply this helen was
not only a fine girl tinctured with the folly
congenital to all girls but any exploitation
of her shame would rebound to mrs cur-
wen and strike again at congressman
bryan-thropes rival for the governor-
ship so in making the scandal public to
injure thropes candidacy that of bryans
would also be-if not blackened at least
hurt

  the letter which had caused so much
concern and about which all events had
pivoted was from congressman bryan to
mrs curwen the letter was not clear by
any means it had evidently been written
for mrs curwen s birthday and it was a
letter of gratitude and love from a son to a
mother who appreciated her great love and
sacrifices on behalf of his career to a mother
who had deliberately kept herself in the
shadows secretly almost furtively cheer-
ing and aiding her boy willing-the letter
said-to make all of the sacrifices of
motherhood without publicly claiming any
of the honors

  i judged and the author congressman
bryan evidently believed that he had been
born fatherless and that mrs curwen


adventure

rather than let such stigma cling to him had
made arrangements for putting him into
the world as a foundling

  i did not understand this at all but it
was not my business to understand i
could not see why since she called herself a
mrs and acknowledged helen as a daugh-
ter this brilliant son had not been given
a home and name

  but people work out their own lives in
their own way and some of them do not
make such mistakes as some of us catching
only furtive and half-revealed glances
think

  for another tiling in our compromise
thrope agreed to hold no grudge against
whibley i impressed upon him that this
last was an agreement in which i had taken
a very strong personal interest whibley
was the type of man i will go far from my
path any time to help i intimated to
thrope that any interference with whib-
leys career would be pressure on my toes
and he knew that i very much resented
having my feet stepped on

  i let him up and he sat at the table ca-
ressing his bottle of whisky between glasses
feeling not at all ashamed of what he had
gone through with and been exposed in
but rather pleased to think an amiable
understanding had been reached that pro-
tected every one

  without anger but with evident dis-
taste i tried to tell thrope just what man-
ner of man he was and what i thought of
him it is needless to repeat i simply said
in a few words what i have been making
clear but even i did not know did not
suspect the worst about him had i done
so i believe i would have killed him

  i know that i would have killed him-
tossed him a gun and invited him to try
to shoot first  might have let him fire the
first shot i have done so on rare occasions
when i was perfectly willing to go down
in return for the satisfaction of being able
honorably to murder a ruffian

  the man does not live who can shoot so
uick or hit me in a spot so deadly that in
such a duel as i mention i can not-if with
nothing more than muscular reflex action-
shoot in return and there are seconds when
i can not miss

  i must qualify that slightly there is one
spot which would be fatal to me in such cir-
cumstances but it is not head or heart it
is the wrist for a broken wrist would cut off

the muscular reaction that is one reason i
have broken more gun-mens wrists than
probably any other so-called gun-fighter on
the coast some people think that i have
broken wrists because i hesitated to kill
even human vermin

  but to return to thrope in the light of
subsequent events i will be bold enough to
say that i would even have stooped to
shoot him in the back if in no other way i
could have prevented what presently came
to pass that is of course if i had had pro-
phetic vision and known what was going to
happen

  he kept faith with me regarding the
agreements about myself and captain
whibley it was something else something
ten times more inconceivably vile nor did
it directly concern helen curwen

  thrope had reasons for keeping his eye
on mrs curwen she was really mrs cur-
wen and curwen was less than five years
dead

  helen was her daughter thrope had
remarked the beauty of helen he had
insidiously and secretly become acquainted
with her flattered her turned her head
promised-i dont know what all-and ex-
plained in some ingeniously specious way
why mrs curwen hated him so much

  helen curwen did not know the truth-
not until after she had at thropes instiga-
tion stolen the letter which i returned to
mrs curwen she had read it but not
understood scarcely suspected what it
really meant until on board the jessie dar-
ling when thrope gleefully had made it
clear

  helen had been frightfully shocked the
idea that her mother had a past cut so
deeply that it awakened her to her own
folly and in desperation she had appealed-
for lack of any one else to whom she could
appeal-to yang li and that wily wise
old chinaman showed himself a human
being

  being a reader of character as most if not
all chinamen are he thrust the girl unan-
nounced under my protection and that i
came near failing in giving her the needed
protection was not the fault of yang li

  the hardest part of the effort to effect a
general compromise and secrecy of what
had happened was with captain whibley
he swore by all the gods of a seaman that
thrope should be brought to the bar for his
wickedness toward helen
 bom to be hanged but-



  a simple-hearted old sea captain-he be-
lieved in justice and the honor of courts
it was with difficulty i impressed the truth
upon him then he was incredulous but
he yielded to the appeal of protecting
helen her name her future that touched
him he agreed

  so i helped captain whibley on to tire
quarter-dee and tyler-as good a man as
could be found in the forecastle on any
ship for holding a course-took the wheel
thxope stood by himself at the windward
-ail and helen and i remained by the cap-
tain-and we came back through the
golden gate

vih

a the next day the papers had quite
a story and told everything but the
truth my name appeared conspicu-
ously for this was in a way what is called
a follow-up story on the smith affair in
which i had been referred to as the no-
torious et cetera but i was not called
the notorious et cetera in the papers which
thrope influenced upon my return

  no new facts had been discovered
which showed that i shot in self-defense
the three witnesses of the gambling game
admitted that they lied that the whole was
a frame-up i was not even to be arrested
the three witnesses had been arrested for
perjury before the coroners jury-such is
the way in graft and politics henchmen are
broken and thrown to the scrap-heap true
enough they escaped prison but they were
scapegoats

  the dead seamen took the blame of the
mutiny on the jessie darling and thrope
whibley and myself had made a glorious
fight against them not a word about yang
li oh well he never cared for publicity
any way

  and how was the name of helen curwen
cleared with unsuspected brilliancy i
read it two times and remained incredulous
she was mrs captain whibley making her
honeymoon voyage with the captain and
so far as anybody ever found out to the
contrary-excepting of course-mrs cur-
wen-that was true helen and captain
whibley were in love and they did marry
in a way that interfered not at all with the
rather premature announcement

thrope as a friend of the bride and of
the captain had intended to take a little sea-



voyage to honolulu and back before enter-
ing upon the last lap of his campaign he
had needed the rest that was precisely
what he had intended for he felt certain
that the letter would be a bombshell in the
camp of bryan and he thrope could afford
the leisure of a sea trip even as a crucial
moment of the campaign

  about the only two people i met who did
not appear satisfied were mrs curwen and
delaney

  delaney almost wept then he swore
loud and fervently he cursed me for hav-
ing ever suspected that he would give a
friend a double-cross i took his statement
with sufficient salt to make it palatable and
said nothing to ease his resentment against
thrope

  much of that resentment was genuine
it had hurt delaneys pride-however much
or little it had hurt his honor-to think that
anybody even thrope and the police would
arrange a frame-up against his friend in his
own saloon

  he was angry he asked if i thought i
could ever have got away with the bluff
i worked to get from the saloon if he had
not willingly aided i remarked that i
probably could not have got away as easily
as i had done if he had not been so agree-
able but that i would have shot-and he
knew it

  but at that i believe delaney was more
sincere than  really wanted to give him
credit for i am suspicious of everybody
particularly of my friends

  i went to see mrs curwen

  she was very distressed andshowed it
age seemed to have come suddenly-to claim
his full debt and interest

  i am desperate-desperate she said
again and again she repeated that remark-
ing that there was no one to whom she
could go my boy wants to tell the world
i am his mother she said after i had let
her know the vicissitudes of the ill-fated
letter but it cant be she said st with
an intonation of finality there was some-
thing more than a womans sacrificial stub-
bornness in her voice

  he doesnt know-even yet-all and
i cant tell him ever she said

  i did not understand that remark she
did not appear to expect me to understand
i made no comment

  to make one sentence of it thrope she
said was an enemy from of old she had

i


adventure

known him for many many years and for
most of them had been afraid of him

  i am terribly afraid of him she re-
peated looking at me in such a way that i
could not very well help saying-

  any time just send word to me through
delaney of the hoop-la saloon

  she told me more than it is necessary to
repeat of how she had watched over the boy
keeping her secret from every one but him
on his twelfth birthday she had ventured
to tell him the truth

  or as much of it as my shame would let
me i said his father was dead and- she
broke off chokingly

  when i had tirst returned the letter to her
she had learned that thrope was after it
and she determined to destroy it but she
could not it meant too much mr ellis
who had been sent to san francisco as soon
as bryan had learned of the letter being
lost and who guided by gossip along the
barbary coast had searched me out then
discovered from mrs curwen that it had
already been returned and he had returned
to me and generously paid the money he
had been given to offer as a reward

  mrs curwen afraid of thrope had given
up the house and moved into an apartment
that was why i could not locate her at
last determined to ease her mind for once
and all she had decided to burn the letter
then she had found that it was gone and a
blank piece of paper had been substituted
as she had read and reread it frequently
she knew the substitution had been but re-
cently made

  she never suspected helen but was thor-
oughly frightened she did not know that
helen and thrope had even met mrs
curwen had spent a terrible week-which
had its anguish greatly increased by the dis-
appearance of helen

  all of her life fear and tragedy had
stalked beside her and now she was tensely
wrought up the capacity for passive suf-
fering had been exhausted

  thrope will try to use that letter against
my boy she cried and if he does- oh
if he does-

  she broke off

  for a moment the tigress that is in every
woman appeared her hands became claws
and her face changed to a harpys stir
any woman-any man-to the ultimate
depths of desperation and there will appear
the claws and gleaming teeth

  anthropologists estimate that we were
beasts of the clawing hands and teeth about
four times as long as we of the so-called
human race have been men and women a
moment of ferocious tenseness-and she
was exhausted and fell back weakly into
her chair she muttered rather than said-

  oh if the people only knew-but i cant
tell-i wont tell i would die first

  she said nothing more and i did not ques-
tion her but i was more moved than i shall
try to express

  i havent repeated and do not intend to
repeat what she told me of how she suffered
and worked and planned to help that boy
now the line congressman of how her heart
would almost leap from her breast at men-
tion of his name and of the secret pride she
felt when people praised him as fearless and
brilliant of how she hung in the agony of
suspense at every election for fear he might
not win-and now to think his career might
be crumbled in one cowardly shameful
blow against which she could oppose no
buckler

  i tried to assure her that her fear was
largely anxiety but she assured me that
there was no infamy to which thrope would
not plunge with pleasure that i had no
conception of what he would do-that i
liad no conception of what he could do and
she would not tell me would not tell any
one never never

  i thought that i could understand her
hysteria but i was deeply touched by her
sorrow by her tragic situation i again
offered to do whatever i could at any time

ix

i shall say nothing of the political
campaign beyond the fact that it was
unusually hot and bitter and that
bryan spoke night after night and seemed
to have aroused the state as it had never
been aroused before against the old gang
and the old gang viciously distorted his
record and attacked him

  for some weeks my life went on about
the same as usual i read the papers and
played cards and people let me alone i
went every time bryan spoke in san fran-
ciso and i liked him he was a fighter-
inspired by something more than the hank-
ering for a governorship

  i looked him over carefully and felt that
there was a man who could not be broken
born to be hanged but-



and would not bend a man whose word and
honor could be trusted and though i
knew very well that he would keep that
word and run the gambling-joints out of the
state-i told whoever took the trouble to
inquire that i should vote for him

  youre crazy said delaney

  id rather have him for an enemy than
thrope for a friend

  hell ruin our business said delaney

  thropes ruined our conscience i
said

  and delaney blinked once or twice and
opened his mouth like a fish and at last
he said incredulously that he believed i
meant it

  how far would you trust thrope i
asked

  no farther an a   carry

  there you are bryan keeps his word
ine never broken mine i shall vote for
him australias wide open-ill go there
and play cards

  the conversation was longer but as tri-
vial and only confirmed delaney in the
opinion that i was crazy

  it was about ten days before election
that delaney gleefully told me my friend
bryan was a goner thrope had an ace
up his sleeve and it was going to be pub-
lished in his paper the next sunday-a
letter of some kind

  i was a little jumpy every time letter
was mentioned

  i wanted to find out definitely but there
was no way i knew of that i could thrope
was out of the city-or was supposed to be
bryan was also out of the city i found
other people living in mrs curwens house
she had sold it

  they did not know where she was
helen had gone to sea with her husband
captain whibley-a real honeymoon this
time i went to bryans headquarters but
there was nobody around there i would
trust so i came away then i went in
search of a newspaper man whom i knew
and rather liked

  he was an alert young fellow full of ideas
and rather flattered by being the friend of
so notorious a figure as myself besides he
had once been fired from-i shall call it the
tribune as it has changed hands since then
and is now a decent paper-the tribune
thropes paper

  supposing i said to him for i knew
no more about the workings of a newspaper

than the average editor does of poker how-
ever much editors play at it supposing
the editor of the tribune had something i
wanted that he intended to put it in the
paper-a picture or a letter how would
i go about getting it

  best wayd be to blow up the building
he said as i did not seem to appreciate the
joke he added soberly

  a picture-maybe theyve taken a copy
and the original is stowed some place let-
ter-anything like that they photograph
it nobody may know where the original
is

  how can i get in to the editor

  i had heard that editors were as unap-
proachable as kings and things

  tell em you got a story-tell em who
you are and that youve got a story you
wont turn loose to nobody but old man
blake himself

  i did at eleven-thirty friday night i
was shown into the anteroom of mr
blakes private office and told to wait i
was left alone i noticed that the ante-
room door locked from the inside though
the lock did not appear ever to have been
used

  i listened at the door marked private
  blake was not alone

  i gently tried the door it was unlocked
i crossed the room and locked the ante-
room door then stepped through the one
marked private saying as i came in-
just the very man i wanted to see mr
thrope

  thxope started to roar but perceived
that it was i and his glance apprehensively
searched out my hands he seemed to
think that i went around ready to shoot

  blake was a fat man bald-headed with
protruding side-whiskersandhe drew in his
breath with toad-like pomposity to order
me out of the room but he looked at
thrope and asked-

  do you know him

  you do too said thrope its-

he mentioned my name with a peculiar
falling inflection muttering it as though
unwilling to speak it aloud

  i suppose that it was unpleasant on his
tongue

  well whatd you want said thrope
trying not to be more unpleasant than he
could help for he knew by this time by
something more than hearsay that i would
-well he remembered smith swanson and


adventure

 certain other men on board the jessie dar-
 ling and though he wished me well out of
 his sight he did not make that wish too ap-
 parent

 bryans letter i told him briefly

 trapped by- said blake apoplec-

 tically and his hand reached toward a but-
 ton at the end of his desk

 supposing you put your hands in
 your pockets mr blake i told him
 pointedly

 his puffed eyes bulged a little but he
 followed my suggestion ramming his hands
 into his pockcts as if defying me instead
 of complying with my gentle request

 she sent vou here thrope accused
 -her

 naturally i said why else do you
 suppose i happened to come-at this psy-
 chological moment i asked not knowing
 what it was all about

 but i never hesitate to take any advan-
 tage that fortune hands to me and i
 have found fortune a most generous
 mistress

 the letter isnt here said blake ad-
 vancing some information in a manner
 that impressed me as too considerate

 no i asked

 no said thrope

 no echoed blake emphatically

 then why do you lie to each other i
 demanded stressing the words just as much
 as i thought was needed to make them un-
 comfortable

 both men gave a slight start i doubt if
 they did realize what i meant but they did
 not feel comfortable

 i had my ear to the keyhole there for
 some moments-before i came in the
 letter is in that safe or you are a liar i
 addressed the last to blake

 he started to bound up with something
 like-

 no man can call me that

 but he sat down and finished his sen-
 tence in an inarticulate mumble

 i had made no move no gesture but he
 understood

you talk too-much thrope ex-
claimed accusingly at the editor

 since i had heard thrope ask him if the
 letter was in the safe and blake had only
 answered i felt the accusation a little un-
 just but i made no comment

 i dont suppose shell telephone now
 said thrope looking at me inquiringly

  oh my presence here will make no differ-
ence she will telephone i suppose i as-
sured him

  its time then said blake staring up at
the clock

  but the letter-first now i said

then i learned something of what
it was all about mrs curwen was
trying to get thrope to give up the
letter he would not meet her but he had
made a telephone appointment she had
assured him that she could give reasons why
he should return the letter to her why he
would be glad to return it

  thrope was naturally incredulous it
seemed that he and mrs curwen had known
each other for many many years and
thrope-though he did not say this-ap-
peared to have taken a sort of pleasure all
those years in keeping her afraid of him
he knew that she was afraid of him and he
had enjoyed the bullying pleasure of keep-
ing her frightened

  by chance i had stepped into the game
and demanded cards at the crucial moment
let me pause a minute to remark that no-
body will be likely to convince me that i
am religious and yet anybody will have a
hard lime convincing me that there is not
something-something sentient in destiny
that rules with an inexorable hand this
thing we carelessly call chance and
luck

  in my own life-and i believe other men
can look into their own lives and find the
same-it has happened too often that by so-
called chance i have made such entrances
and by chance played such part in the lives
of men and women as if my re were di-
rected by a great and watchful dramatist

  this thing we call luck and chance
is too pertinent too advertent too much the
fabric of design to be merely accidental
i know many lips will trace skeptical smiles
upon themselves at such a statement but
let the more thoughtful reflect that every
situation begins and develops from some-
thing-some meeting word introduction
from something that can properly be called
chance

  this is so true that it can not be denied
once any one recognizes the viewpoint from
which i make the statement and i never
before or since felt myself so much the
pawn of some inscrutable chance as in the
affair of thrope and mrs curwen
bom to be hanged but-



  ihe whole tiling moved to its inexorable
end its inexorable and tragic end too
inevitably to have been mere happen-
chance but of course i am telling a story
-not offering a contribution to meta-
physics

  mrs curwen telephoned

  naturally with all the honesty of her
nature she denied that i had had anything
to do with the plan to get in touch with
thrope she denied that i had found from
her where he could be located at that hour

  and i fancy that she was surprized at the
sudden change in thropes manner over
the telephone for when he had said some
fifty words in his characteristic manner-
or at least the manner that he seemed to
employ toward women whom he did not
care to flatter-he abruptly became polite
and almost gracious the suggestion that
he do so of course came from me and
came in such a way that he did not care
to refuse

  i could make nothing of the conversa-
tion over the phone because i heard very
little of it after thrope quieted down mrs
curwen seemed to be doing all of the talk-
ing and it seemed to me that thrope was
strangely impressed and by something
more than i had said

  i noticed him biting his knuckles as
if to restrain his emotion but i re-
flected that might have been from sup-
pressed anger but his whole manner dis-
closed a nervousness that was remarkable
he glanced almost furtively from me to
blake as though fearful that we too were
hearing

  the conversation lasted for some min-
utes it ended with thrope agreeing to
make an appointment to meet her alone in
his own office the following night

  i found out afterward-from her-that
she had summoned one of the specters that
haunted her past and set it on to thrope
mrs curwen in her younger days had
been reckless rash even more so than
helen she too had loved thrope he had
murdered a man before her eyes she had
had no part in the crime but the love she
then bore him which constrained her to
secrecy

  always she had been afraid that the story
would come out and that thrope would-
as he threatened-make it appear that she
had killed the man herself at last des-
perate she had reversed the situation and

declared that whatever the shame might be
to her she was going to force the story out
and blast him though it blasted her too
as a coward always is when the victim
turns thrope was frightened

  but by the following night thrope had
summoned his ingenuity he had made de-
ductions and arrived at what seemed satis-
factory conclusions for bullying the woman
further let her force the story out into the
public he ended by hoping she would do
it for he-he could make political capital
of it besides what is money for if not to
prove alibis even in a murder of twenty
years ago

  i am getting a little ahead of my narra-
tive the letter was yet to be disposed of
that however did not take long

  when the telephone conversation was
over i merely repeated that i wanted it
and at once and blake unlocked the little
office safe and gave it to me then i struck
a match and burned it and ground the
ashes into the carpet with my heel

  i faced them and said

  something unpleasant will happen to
somebody if the attempt is made to arrest
me on the charge of robbing a girl or fleec-
ing a miner or violating the ordinance
about obstructing the traffic or on any other
of the trumped-up charges which you fel-
lows usually make to get a man into jail
think up something original very original
if you want me to pay attention to it-then
send a detective you dont care much about
to serve it

  i was young and of course talked a little
more than i would under similar circum-
stances now about the last thing that a
young man learns is that no words or at
most two or three will usually be more im-
pressive than a speech-such as play-
wrights like to give heroes

  but what i did say was brief enough to
carry weight with thrope and blake-
largely because they knew that spike de-
laney had so to speak put his sheltering
wing over me and would as the phrase goes
start something if another frame-up was
pulled on me

x

this ends my story i will get to
the concluding facts briefly

the following morning through de-
laney mrs curwen anxiously sent word for
me to meet her


adventure

  it was to be a busy day for thrope and
he did not know how much if at all before
midnight he could get to the office and keep
his appointment with her mrs curwen
was exceedingly nervous but she said that
she was not afraid however she wanted
me to conceal myself in the office as a wit-
ness of what passed between them

  i am afraid she said tremulously i
shall have to tell him something that no one
on eartli knows but myself-and-and i
want you to know i trust you-after what
you did about that letter and for helen
and after what mr ellis says

  ellis edwin ellis i found-he was the
man who had come to me offering ten
thousand for the recovery of the letter and
had later forced payment of that sum upon
me-was a detective from washington who
had been hurried to san francisco as soon
as mrs curwen had reported the loss of the
letter the first time we met he had
learned that  had it but not that i had
returned it as soon as he discovered that
i had returned the letter he generously
gave me the reward that bryan had been
willing to pay

  the elevator ran until ten oclock on
saturday nights in the thrope building
mrs curwen went up at ten and i followed
a minute later she suggested that it
might be best for us not to be seen together

  she opened the door direct from the hall
into thropes private office and left it un-
locked for me-or rather held it ajar for
me and held her finger warningly to her lip

 somebodys in there-i heard them
move she whispered soundlessly indi-
cating a door that opened from the private
office into another room

 nobody could very well have proper
business in there since no light was burn-
ing-or at least none showed under the door

  i tiptoed across and listened but i heard
nothing

  perhaps mrs curwen had been mistaken
but the chances always were that thrope
could not be trusted and he might have
somebody there-and that somebodys
presence might be for any purpose

  i looked at mrs curwen she wore a
long coat and a bonnet hat the thick
veil that had covered her face was lifted so
i could see how brightly her eyes were burn-
ing eyes that seemed much sunken since
we last met and how tightly thin her ups
were pressed she looked more like a figure

of stately allegory than a woman come to
plead with a man for she stood erect and
the long lines of the coat that fell below her
knees gave her form a certain dignity such

as one seldom sees

  she would not flinch i could teu that
much

  i spoke to her with lip movement rather
than with sound-noiselessly i told her
to pretend to telephone that she would not
wait and was leaving then to step into the
hall and shut the door after her

  she did so

  i stood beside the door opening into the
next room and waited for some seconds
au was quiet then i detected the shuffling
of feet silence again the party on the
other side was listening

  the lock turned in the door it moved
cautiously then sbwly opened so that a
little furtive middle-aged man blinked in
the light he was near-sighted and wore
heavy glasses and too he had come from
a dark room into a lighted one

  mine is not a gentle hand my fingers
fastened on the back of his neck the other
hand went over his mouth and silenced the
cry that he started to make he was a
weak little office-bred clerk frightened and
not even cunning bv occupation he was
court reporter very good at shorthand he
said

  some woman was coming to blackmail
mr thrope and he had been posted there
to take a stenographic record he said and
at once admitted that he had lied he
tried another evasion or two then admitted
that he was thropes stenographer he
had been with thrope for years he knew
that a woman was coming to meet thrope
and he had been posted to take it down

  a little listening-hole had been made in
the wall i might almost say that it had
been built in he showed it to me and ad-
mitted that it had been used on many oc-
casions a small electric light partly boxed
in illuminated a small shelf upon which
he could rest his pad and make his notes
with ease

  i took a towel fashioned a gag and
locked mr stenographer in the lavatory
i took his keys from him and investigated
the various doors i thought it might be
well for me to have some way out in case i
wanted to leave without interrupting the
interview between thrope and mrs cur-
wen thropes offices-he was at the head
bom to be hanged but-



of a big lumber company-occupied very
nearly half of the space on one side of the
building and i found that i could open a
door far down the corridor and near the
stairs-almost a third of a block away
from thropes private office

  mrs curwen and i said a few words but
she was in no mood to talk so not knowing
what minute thrope might come i went
inside to the peep-hole and waited i could
watch her and did she sat very quiet
motionless except that her breathing was
deep and hurried as if she were making a
severe effort to control herself

thrope came big hearty and
sure of himself

  well mary he said with kind
of sardonic amusement we meet again

  yes again

  so youre going to try to rake up the
past eh you know what  happen i
was a fool to ever try to protect you for that
murder mary but then you see i didnt
really know you killed him and i loved
you

  mrs curwen was amazed she did not
realize that thrope was talking for the
benefit of the stenographic report-that
was not being taken

  and so this bryan is your brat eh
and you want him elected trying to
bluff me out of the running i am too weak
with women-they twist me around their
fingers you know you used to do it
but you cant bully me no what do you
want

  she told him speaking in a low strained
voice that she wanted him to withdraw
from the campaign that she wanted him to
give up the fight against bryan

  you will regret it-oh how you will
regret it if you dont

  it was more of a prophecy than a
threat she was not angry she was
pleading

  he is your- thrope used the ugly

word generally applied to the children of
unfortunate mothers

  and yours she cried

  i doubt if she had intended to say as
much to tell him that at all but the retort
was irresistibly drawn from her

  they stared at each other and stared
and stared and made no move

  is that true he asked in a low almost
inaudible voice

yes and quickly pleadingly she
sketched the history of how she had helped
and guarded the boy and never told him
who his father was and made him feel that
it was better that he should not let the world
know who his mother was because she
wanted him to rise-to go up and on and
be honest to be noble

  and he couldnt do it she hissed if
he knew such blood as yours was in his
veins

  thrope believed her he knew she spoke
the truth but he was a politician and
there was less manhood in him than there
is in the jackal which will fight for its own

  you lie woman you lie you cant
prove that i-

  no she cut in because i had a good
father and mother and met you secretly
because they disliked you i can prove
nothing i do not need proof you know
it oh give up this campaign-let him win
dont drag up my shame to light i dont
care but it is for him for my boy-
your son that letter-that horrible un-
lucky letter how proud  was when he
sent it to me you might have made the
letter public because you will do anything
to get your end but now-now you must
not fight him i didnt intend to tell you
it was my secret nine and gods

  leave god out of it when you lie you

cant bluff me like that hes yours-

and youre trying to drag me into it this
is the craftiest political deal ive erer run
up against i suppose he put you up to
come now look here old girl ill show you
what happens when anybody tries to put
something over on me every word of this
interview goes in the paper tomorrow morn-
ing-in the tribune theres a stenog-
rapher in there has taken down every word
im not afraid let the public judge be-
tween us my son- your-

  the fold of mrs curwens cloak was
pushed aside a large ivory handled nickel-
plated revolver came into view and as it
came into view she shot

  thrope fell dead a bullet in his brain

gpjnb when people came a-pounding at
figzfl the door and ilung it open for it
ittml was not locked i turned hastily
back from that door that led inside and
without seeming to have a purpose in doing
so barred the way so mrs curwen es
caped alone i had taken the gun from her


adventure

hand as she stood motionless looking down
upon the man whom she had at last paid
with the full measure of vengenace

  the shot that killed thrope seemed too
to have numbed her realization of what she
had done it was not until  took the gun
from her hand and pushed her inside the
room from which  had just come that she
seemed to understand that there was a
chance to escape she had not appeared to
think of trying to or of caring to escape i
am inclined to believe that she had come
determined to kill him anyway certainly
she knew that she had nothing to fear from
the stenographic report of the conversation
upon which thrope had depended

  it was not gallantry or even forethought
on my part that caused me to turn and take
the blame i did it instinctively but
having done so i could not refuse to carry
the role out i would make no statement
to any one the evidence was incontrover-
tible i could not escape conviction

  let me review the situation briefly if
mrs curwen kept silent i could not escape
hanging if she confided with bryan and
he as the governor declined to injure his
career by pardoning me i could not escape
true i could have stirred up a sensation
but i could have proved nothing blake of
the tribune offered to use his influence-
preposterous he had none and i told him
so-in getting me a pardon if i would tell
the truth

  he suspected that mrs curwen was im-
plicated he also thought of using the copy
and photograph of one page of the letter
but was afraid to go through with it but
bryan who was readily elected was in
almost as bad a iix as i if he pardoned me
people would say that he had connived
with me to put his personal and political
enemy out of the way if he did not pardon
me-well he had his own conscience to live
with

  the truth could not come out unless his
own mother was thrown into the prisoners
dock and the hideous and sordid story ex-
hausted to its last detail

  any way out somebodys life would be
ruined-some innocent persons life for i
refuse to consider mrs curwen guilty
though i think she had been touched by
madness a jury might have acquitted her
but thropes friends would have been pow-
erful besides her sons career would have

 been ruined-and that was more to her
than life

  i felt sorry for her and for the young
governor but not sorry enough to be
hanged though i showed some patience in
the trial and conviction

  in fact i had to be convicted before the
governor could help me i was convicted
and was sentenced by a judge of thropes
own choosing to be hanged

  that judge put much feeling into the
reading of the death sentence he had
shown all through the trial plenty of grati-
tude to the memory of the man who had
raised him on stuffed ballots to the
bench

  i have never had much use for circum-
stantial evidence or belief in capital punish-
ment since those trying days

  what happened in some mysterious
manner i got hold of a revolver and held up
the turnkey one morning between mid-
night and dawn my good friend delaney
had paid that turnkey the sum of ten thou-
sand dollars to give me this revolver and to
be held up and of course delaney had no
objections to paying out such a large sum
because it was the ten thousand dollars that
bryan through ellis had given me as a re-
ward for returning that letter-of malignant
influence

  by an odd coincidence that nobody
seemed to remark i escaped on the night
before captain whibley-who had left the
thrope lumber companys service-sailed
on a windjammer for sydney

  but four people knew delaney sam
tyler who met me at the wharf and took
me to whibleys ship and whibley and
helen mrs curwen had told her so the
bread i had cast upon the water came back
to me and the governor had not connived
at my escape nor was he embarrassed by
having to pardon me i believe that he
would have done so-still it is a terrible
thing to make a politician even an honest
one choose between his conscience and his
career

sickness death cut governor
bryan off as he was finishing his
second term shortly afterward
mrs curwen died with the death of her
son she had nothing more to live for the
confession that cleared my name was found
under her pillow
author of the spirit oj his youth too much caulionclc

ttree large evil men lolled in
sultry shade of spade gowdys
nugget saloon watching one
 small righteous man at work in
the sun it was far too hot to work but
obadiah higgins toiled painstakingly with
the resiny pine planking of the curb over
the newly dug saloon well the three
onlookers had struck a bargain with oba-
diah and were only awaiting the completion
of the task to enjoy seeing obadiah take
his strange payment

  the wait was not irksome for obadiah
was a deft workman besides he had been
working on that well-curb since early morn-
ing and it was now nearly noon obadiah
drove the last nail as carefully and surely
as he had the first skillfully he planed
down imperceptible rough spots carefully
he hung the new pulley-wheel in the exact
center of the frame in fact it was a
wcll-curb fit to grace any well in the little
eastern hamlet that had been his home
town instead of being set over a saloon
well a mere unpain ted pine necessity in a
squalid little gulch town like el oro

  obadiah paused a moment to inspect his
handiwork obadiah was scrawny yes
obadiah higgins was scrawny he couldnt
have tipped the scales over one hundred
and twenty at his prime-if he ever had
any prime-and now he was well past his
prime-fifty at least gray with a smoothly
shaven face pleasantly furrowed cheery
little wrinkles played about the comers of
his eyes and humorous up-turned ones
were etched where his lips met in their
not too firm line in front of his toothless
gums his nose was thin too like the

rest of him and ended in a little hook
his eyes-his wistful gray eyes that had
always trusted everybody and just couldnt
get over their puppylike faith in the good-
ness of everything-looked out hungrily on
a world they seemed never to understand -
obadiah had been cheated he-he was
-well possibly there was something lack-
ing forty years he had endured the rail-
lery of thoughtless citizens of the little home
town - back east-forty years of satirical
gibes that alone would have been enough
to shift the balance of a stronger mind than
his finally one of the younger generation
openly called him a -- fool obadiah
with a childlike faith that he could go
out west and make good summoned all
his courage and bid the town good-by

  ten years obadiah pitted his frail
strength against the stem odds of the
gold country finally he drifted to el
oro he could have been a skilled worker
in fine woods elsewhere but in el oro he
was a carpenter while it was pitifully
apparent he had been a failure all along
he still harbored eternal hope that he could
before the end go back home and show
them that he had madegood

evidently obadiah decided the
job was satisfactorily done for he
ssfflgrput away his tools and proceeded
to reap his reward taking from his tool-
kit a tomato can half filled with a black
fluid composed of lampblack and a dash
of the camps meager supply of kerosene
obadiah knelt stifly before the curb and
stirred expectantly with the caked brush
that was mostly handle then with infinite

care he printed on the glaring hot planks
a big boyish looking g repeating the
process he turned out an o then a d

  g-o-d-good stated spade gowdy
to his two companions in the shade

  youre wrong there spade argued
moore you agreed to let obadiah print
any dad-gum thing on it he wanted to
longs hed build it for you leave it to
him but for gosh sake let him pull off a
new one

  with much stirring and many gyrations
of his tongue against his cheek obadiah
had placidly gone ahead unmindful of the
argument and evolved the righteous sen-
tence 

god is not mocked

   gawd is not m-o-c-k-e-d mock-ed
moc-ke-d spade gowdy struggled with
the letters neck-ed-hah neckkid 
parson out there says uncle billy gawd

aint neckkid hows he know heh par-
son howd you know he aint neckkid
tell us that

  obadiah arose

  boys i dont want to force the word
on you too much but hark ye obadiahs
meek tones suddenly became clarion clear
as he quoted  unto him that blas-
phemeth against the holy ghost it shall
not be forgiven luke twelve ten

  stepping humbly to another side of the
curb he knelt stirred and printed

  wow mocked spade ol postle
paul sure turned on the gas that time
wont be forgiven eh whats the idee
to beller so about that

  say spade carver began earnestly
faith i do wish yed a leetle more eddica-
cation then ye wouldnt be foriver danglin
the sword of damocles over us this way
if ye dont belave theres a creator keep
shut about it like i do

  well we-- gasped spade in feigned
astonishment why hello st peter

get saloon and begin distributin tracts
say you red-headed irishman if you want
to begin preachin get a paint-pot an go
to it-but come first inside an paint a sign
bartender wanted and let me pay you
off

  carver only swore

  presently craning the three shifted their
positions in the shade to see what obadiah
had produced

whatsoever a man soweth

  moore read the words quizzically

   whatsoever a man seweth repeated
spade wonderingly

  they waited in silence until obadiah had
finished the third side before they ven-
tured out into the dazzling arizona sun to
view the result

that shall he also reap

  spade stared at moore in blank unbe-
lief he started to speak but caught his
word half uttered and doubled in raucous
laughter

  neckkid he gasped seweth-shall al-
so rip haw parson you gotteth off a new
one on me come inside an have a drink
on the house

  obadiah waved his brush in lieu of reply
on the fourth side he was laboriously print-
ing his final shot
three wise men



strong drink is raging whosoever is deceived
thereby is not wise

  obadiah feeling well paid for his morn-
ings labor hummed as he neatly repacked
his kit

   strong drink is r-a-g-i-n-g  spade
was endeavoring to lind out what obadiah
had said about strong drink on his well-
curb eventually he decided the word
was rag-ging he announced strong
drink is ragging what the-

  you bet it is moore affirmed that
hooch you and carver peddle in your
honkeytonk sure puts raggin into a fellers
feet and the rags on his back makes him
raggy ragged and rank ive been loaf-
ing around this joint a week when id
ought to been out to my diggins gatherin
in a pooch-full of dust instead of spendin
hit come  in ill take a last drink
with you im dry myself

  w-e-e-ll look-e-e there
carver was gazing intently at
something that had appeared out
of the blistering hills at the upper end of
the gulch a half-human object that pro-
gressed in weird humpings and stumblings
among the hot rounded boulders of the
creek bed

  well id say mumbled spade leering
half-heartedly at the bobbing figure looks
like a whinny-diddle

  something coming to git yuh spade
moore jeered by judas the prophets
right strong drink is raging-i see it
myself im goin to take a drink of
water

  its a man thots what it is carver
stated together they peered through the
shimmering heat waves at the humping
object obadiah set down his tool-kit and
stared with the others

  yuh see hit too parson queried
moore

  i-yes my eyes- obadiah brushed
the back of his hand across his face and
shaded his eyes with both hands yes-
and i think its a man possibly some
prospector out of water wed better go
up and do what we can to help him out

  what up there in that sun grum-
bled spade youre crazier n i am an
im drunk an youre not go nothin
send for gawd let him do it thats
his trade savin fellers

  aw come on spade moore slapped
gowdys broad back with his open hand
i know youre drunk spade and itll half
kill you to walk out in that sun but i just
got a hankerin to see come on were
goin too

  already obadiah and carver were twenty
yards up the gulch stumbling over the
loose hot stones and splashing around the
pools of tepid black water moore seized
spade by the buckle of his protruding belt
and dragged him protesting after

  mustnt let him drink much of this
water chattered obadiah as he and the
irishman struggled forward if its a thirsty
prospector yes see hes down drinking
a barrel of it come on lets hurry

  a moment more and obadiah had the
shaggy head of the heat-crazed prospector
in his lap shading the tormented man as
best he could with his body and bathing the
parched lips and brow spade and moore
scarce a minute behind fell upon the pros-
pectors sack of ore which carver had
already found and was emptying excitedly
upon the sand

  gold yelled spade

  gold howled carver mine-i got
it-its mine i tell ye

  shut up moores heavy hand crashed
full against spade gowdys thick mouth
and he shoved carver aside dont
wake up the whole camp course its gold
what else do you reckon a man d pack
till he croaked alive like that fellers
a-doin he indicated the prostrated
man

  sure an i blave the parsond pack his
paint-pot soothed carver diplomatically

  the three peered surreptitiously back
toward el oro to see if by any chance
some one had ventured out in the noon
sun and seen them ail appeared quiet
the camp squatting low amid the baking
boulders and shimmering in the heat ap-
peared deserted no living thing was im
sight only the heat waves danced along
the crooked white street distorting the
buildings into fantastic shapes

  lets hide it suggested spade jerking
his head toward the ore an him too
he motioned to the prospector and winked
significantly

  know him any of you know this
man interrupted obadiah anxiously fan-
ning the patient with his hat im afraid
hes in bad shape


adventure

  not half as bad as he will be in a min-
ute growled spade

  help me carry him to camp boys
begged obadiah

  whered he git this rock hes packin
spade moore ignored obadiahs plea
lets smuggle im off somewheres an
when he comes alive make him tell where
he got hit at

  you bet make him tell grunted
spade from where on his knees he was
gloating over the chunks of gold-flecked
rock gold-pure yauer gold talk about
gawd-well here he is this is what
everybody worships and grovels down
to

  lucky dog murmured carver eying
the prostrate prospector lucky dog-
say sa-a-a-a-y

  carver looked from one to the other of
his companions then crept softly to the
still figure and bending over it searched
the pockets deftly

   thou shalt not steal  reminded oba-
diah gently

  bah ye little snipe barked carver
ah a-a-ah eagerly his fingers drew forth
the grimy location notice unfolding it he
glanced over the heading and skipped
eagerly down to the location  in the
jackear peak district  he read half aloud
 about one hundred and twenty miles in
a southwesterly direction from el oro 
that was all anxiously they gathered
together and searched the document for
further guidance there was none the
name of the locator was signed henry
blane in a forceful scrawl as if the writer
at last the possessor of a fortune had
managed to convey his pride into his writ-
ing clearly henry blane had found a
bonanza and was on his way to file his
location notice immediately the three
men became acutely solicitous as to henrys
welfare

  here parson- seizing henry blanes
limp shoulders moore lifted them clear of
the hot sands-help me pack him over to
my cabin

  not much-to mine demanded car-
eer glaring at moore indignantly

  both wrong spade started forward
an evil glint in his dark eyes well pack
him to-to- spade hesitated as his eyes
caught the gleaming rock scattered on the

sand no go ahead any-place

  craftily as the others lifted the limp

form spade thrust the rich rock back into
the sack and essayed to slip away among
the brush and boulders

  moore seeing him halted and unfeel-
ingly let the fore end of henry drop heavily
as he drew his huge six-shooter

  come on back with that sack spade
he ordered or well lynch you here an
now dont make me bring eveiybody out
from el oro by my shootin

  spade was loath and slow to obey

  come on back you fat booze-hound
moore gritted drawing back the heavy
hammer with a pronounced click come
on in

  yes come on in added carver lay
thot sack on hennerys belly an grab holt
his belt opposite the parson there

  and we can take him to my cabin
offered obadiah its the nearest anyhow
i can take good care of him there boys
come on mr gowdy please and help take
this man to my house

  sullenly spade obeyed placing the sack
of ore on henrys lank middle and assisting
as carver had suggested thus they stole
to obadiahs neat little cabin on the out-
skirts of el oro and set about bringing
their patient back to consciousness

  henry blane responded nobly to their
ridiculous ministrations while his eyes
were yet dimmed with hallucination his
first thought was for his sack of ore

  wheres my sack he demanded thickly
then his sight clearing momentarily he
glimpsed the faces of spade carver and
moore bending over him he quickly
amended it to which one o you got my
sack which one i say desperately he
raised himself on one elbow and clawed for
his gun finding the weapon gone he sank
back resignedly take it i know where
theres a ledge of it as long as a crazy mans
dream i was a fool to bring any of it along
awful rough traveling-hot-straight up
an down-moren a hundred an twenty
mile-cactus an brush-rock an loose
gravel-sand sand sand-sand an
sun-

twenty minutes later henry
blane awoke again to inquire after
his sack then once more seeing
the three hard visages hovering solicitously
about his cot he grunted resignedly-
fat chanct a sick fellers got with this
layout
three wise men



  why heres your sack hank right
here bellowed spade jovially in his best
saloon-welcome manner being exceedingly
anxious to retain the esteem of henry blane

  shure seconded carver equally as
merrily we was only bringin it along
for ye to have whin ye woken up hennery
he added his hand to help spade lay the
sack in henrys lap jim moore too put
forth a hand to assist in the presentation

  well i be blowed gasped henry all
precedent shaken to the foundation then
seeing obadiah hovering on the outskirts
of the trio henry suddenly understood
ho theres a parson he settled back in
relief got a parson in camp hev you

didnt you parson howd you do it
anyhow theyd got off with it ef you
hadnt been watchin that i know me

obadiah strove to believe he was telling

blane positively

  henry looked around dubiously

pede as theys only room for one more

erin who picked you up savin yore life

  it lays in a little canon on this slope of
the jackear mountains about the middle
of the range nearest the peaks to git
there go out to sandy spring thirty mile
west of el oro and then slew off southwest
straight toward them jackears when you
find the right canon foller up it till you
come to a break-a plumb blank wall that
juts right up out o the canon bed this
falls is white rock-youll know it when
you see it if youve had to trace a dozen
other canons before you hit the right one
well when you find this white wall in the
canon youll know youre in the right one
so go on over and follow up the canon about
a quarter mile more where youll come to
a spring with some grass around it

  therell likely be a couple o burros
there-mine i left em there sos to make

henry fn up about a hundred yards

fervently thank you ever so much i

obadiah had to run to catch up
with his late companions hearing
his footsteps they turned spade
appraised obadiah scornfully

  why hello jehovah he drawled in-
sultingly whered you think youre
goin

  why w-w-hy im-i want to go along

anxious look clouding his face

  spade cursed viciously so did moore
and carver

ver hastily itll be an awful thrip youd

too-too weak parson

  sure weak raged spade why if

moore pacifyingly its a hundred and
twenty miles of the roughest hottest going

  spades right parson added moore

much force well count you in on it

where we went er youll wish yuh had

  but obadiah higgins was not to be so
easily talked out of his one great oppor-
tunity he followed terrified lest he lose
his one golden chancc to make good he
grabbed carver and moore by the sleeves
of the soiled undershirts they wore

  im going with you im going too
he panted eagerly appealing from face to
face hoping to find a gleam of kindness
their faces were expressionless and hard
his heart sank im goin with you he
insisted doggedly

  spade gowdy struck obadiahs none too
firm chin with something like two hundred
and twenty pounds back of the blow
obadiah came up dusty and weeping with
rage wordlessly he attacked the aston-
ished spade with a hail of futile blows that
at best reached no higher than spades
thick hairy chest

  haw sneered spade youre too white
around the gills git away

  with that he heaved with his open hand
against obadiahs meager stomach and
doubled him sobbing in the dust

  now here obadiah carver bent over
the cramped little figure you gotta go
aisy if you hopes to finish out the natural
course of yer existence youre goin to

party in this manner now ill tell ye

three wise men



  obadiah turned back happily and trot-
ted with a surprizingly springy step toward
his cabin

  well come on-lets outfit ordered
moore sharply hustle

  together they hurried along the hot
empty street to make ready for their de-
parture ten minutes later they appeared
purposefully prodding a single laden burro
out of town in the direction of sandy spring

  obadiah higgins standing impatiently
waiting in his own doorway saw them go
he watched them as they skirted the few
shacks at the edge of the town and turned
into the little-used trail that led to sandy
spring he watched them until they be-
came but an indistinguishable huddle bob-
bing about in the slanting evening sun-
light vanishing momentarily in the choppy
gulches only to reappear a wavering dot
in the white road against the ridges

  they didnt want me murmured oba-
diah without malice they didnt want
me to go along

  turning he picked up the little bundle
he had prepared and started out alone liis
gaze riveted on the jackcar mountains
which showed low-lying and purple across
the intervening miles of gashed and broken
hills

  the combined gaze of moore carver and
spade was also turned upon that purpling
heap that rimmed the far horizon some-
where on the slope of that rugged range
lay a tiny rain-gutted canon with a blind
wall-and a million-dollar prize eagerly
the three strained their vision toward the
distant peaks and prodded the jack pur-
posefully thirty miles would the beast
carry their packs the remaining distance
of almost impassable country each man
would carry his own pack and canteen

the next morning the great sun
poked his hot orb over the desert
rim and smote them hotly with his
first rays still they plodded the trail to
sandy spring it was an hour later when
they reached their goal thirty miles they
had come almost without conversation
they unpacked the burro released him and
in the shade of the mesquite and luxuriant
water-weed they wearily cooked and ate
their first meal of the trip and lay down to
sleep their packs to be light as possible
permitted of no blankets so the three deter-
minedly scooped hollows in the sand

  the sun hung low in the west that even-
ing before they resumed their journey
they had rested eaten arranged their
packs and filled their canteens eagerly
each with his burden they resumed their
difficult progress each hill-top they
reached every canon-crest they topped
gave them a glimpse of their goal-the
jackear peaks a purple and white phan-
tasm far to the southwest it speeded their
steps like the sound of running water to a
thirsty man

  their muscles unused to heavy work
protested against the pace and each broke
into an unhealthy perspiration with the
sweat streaming from them the setting of
the sun was as welcome as a cooling rain
they paused on a barren hog-back to catch
the faint breath of air that stirred the sea
of heat about them the country that lay
between them and the jackears spread a
gashed and canoned maze of gravel hills
and precipitous cliffs the entire hundreds
of square miles of watershed sloped to the
southeast and countless canons and washes
had carved their gulches in the same direc-
tion pouring their periodical rushes of
water into the boulder-strewn channel that
drained the watershed into the gila

  to reach the jackears without going
completely around the vast watershed
they would necessarily lie obliged to cross
ever one of the myriad gulches thus
each time they topped a ridge it was only
to scramble down the opposite slope then
across the canon floor and up the other
side up and over across up and over-
constantly

  it was like going across a great city with-
out using the streets they would climb
up the front of the first row of dwellings
zigzag across the roof-tops avoiding sky-
lights air-shafts and chimneys thence
slither down the window-ledges and water-
pipes at the rear cross the alleyway only
to be confronted by the necessity of climb-
ing up the rear of the next row and across
the roof-tops and down the fronts into the
street once across the street it would be
up and over again and again well that
was the sort of a situation moore and his
companions were in

  added to their difficulties were the tan-
gled growths of mesquite greasewood and
cactus the loose boulders and hot sands
underfoot coupled with the lack of water
and the great abundance of heat so with


adventure

a sigh of regret the three resumed their
march stumbling down the slope kicking
loose gravel into their shoe-tops and bat-
tling with the thorny brush that tore them
mercilessly in the growing dusk

  throughout the interminable night they
toiled they had decided to travel at
night thinking the cooler air without the
suns burning heat would enable them to
make better time they figured they
could make the remaining ninety miles in
at least three nights travel walk nights
and rest days they had agreed so in
the darkness they fought their way cross-
ing the canons and laboring over the ridges
laying their course as best they could by
the stars though there was a moon it was
waning and the far-distant jackear peaks
were not visible as a guide and the light
the moon afforded was negligible long
before the sun rimmed the eastern horizon
with red spade gowdy felt the need of a
drink

  didnt anybody bring some whisky

along he growled petulantly by-

this is the first time i ever went anywhere
without whisky id give ten bucks for jus

one shot right now carver whyn-

didnt you think to bring some whisky

  whynt you snapped carver i
feel mysilf a dhrink or two wouldnt harm
a body but whats the use discussin
we wouldnt carry it if we had it i got
a plenty to pack as it is fifteen pound i
must have an it feels like a ton no we
dont want whisky

  i do insist spade i do an i
gotta have a drink i tell you

  aw take a drink of water broke in
moore youre lucky to have that bet-
ter go easy on it too it may not last

  water scoffed spade dishwater
tastes like a chip id rather drink the

washings from the bar-sink - any

man thatd go off on a trip like this without
whisky

  cut out the hard luck tale spade
twill be hot enough in an hour an we cn
slape kape your eyes open fer wather
sign-canteensll be dhry by night-how-
lee moses moore wherere ye headin
look man jackear mountains are down
that way-not as yere goin

  moore in the lead paused and followed
carvers pointing finger to where far down
the horizon loomed the purple maze of
the jackear range he had been leading

them almost due west instead of southwest
they had been crossing the canons at an
almost imperceptible slant to the west

  moore cursed vividly

  well this ends night travel how long
we been off the track i dont know-eight
mile-maybe ten you bet well travel
by daylight if it scorches the inside edges
of my gizzard henceforth we plow
straight for that peak its up and down
like this all the way anyhow so we might
as well try to save by going it straight
here we are out maybe six miles of the
hardest going this side of forty years in the
wilderness

   howly m ither   groaned carver  an
whats worse we gotta walk em yet to
catch up to where wed a been if we hadnt
walked em already howiver theres a
consolation-the farther we go the more
likely we be to find a watherin-place he
finished hopefully

  come on spade wake up moore
shook gowdy who had wilted against a
boulder youre a hot specimen to go
prospectin he kicked spade to his feet

  two hours hard travel down a canon
brought them upon a tiny seep at the base
of a sheer canon wall where a cupful of
water could be extracted at half-hour inter-
vals

  exhausted they prepared to sleep the
day out taking turns watching the water
that their canteens might be replenished
continually spade bewailed the lack of
liquor his body so long steeped in drink
craved it to an excruciating degree nei-
ther food nor water could satisfy it was
whisky that spade gowdy craved his face
and the palms of his hands already had
begun to swell his thick speech and strange
eyes told of the torture he was suffering

  his companions distressed but in a
lesser degree did not seek to ease histnisery
better for them they reasoned spade
should drop out spade was a burden
with him out of the way they could make
better time and the riches at the end
could be divided fifty-fifty a two-way
split meant a half million dollars and a
half million dollars will buy-yes quite a
lot of things

  at evening the discussion arose as to
whether they should travel this night or
await the dawn their rapacious minds
reasoned for haste but their sore muscles
parleyed for rest in the end they decided
three wise men



to abide by moores advice and resume the
journey at dawn rather than chance going
astray in the darkness

it was jim moore who insisted
upon the delay and it was jim
moore who an hour later assuring
himself the others were asleep took his can-
teen and slipped away in the direction of
the jackear range he was not afraid of
losing his way jim moore could lay a
straight course in any country by night
deliberately he had planned to abandon
his companions and gain the prize alone-
a million dollars and a oneway split

  the discomfort of lying on a gravel bed
with muscles stiff and aching from unac-
customed use together with several hours
of sleep during the day left carver a trifle
wakeful he had been lying in the sand
wooing slumber when he heard moores
slight stepping when he was satisfied
moore had not merely gone to the seep for
a drink carver raised his head and peered
after the huge figure that showed darkly
against the stony face of the canon wall
without emotion carver impassionately
drew his gun from its holster and fired
the range was not long yet carver missed
moore wheeled to return the fire but car-
ver beat him to it-two shots in quick suc-
cession

cut it out yelled moore you got
me in the leg im cornin back anyhow
youd better grunted carver savagely
why whats the matter moore
whined i was just huntin a place for
us to get out of this canon in the morning
yis wid yer outfit all on yer back
spade had awakened at the shots
whats the shootin whats goin on

here he gabbled whon -

  moores voice from the darkness an-
swered the question

  thats all right carver he compro-
mised ingratiatingly i want to come in
cut out the shootin carver my legs
hurtin somethin powerful third of a
millionll do me anyhow

  long before sunrise they had taken up
their painful journey they calculated
they were sixty miles from their prize
sixty miles may not be a great distance
over a well-defined road or trail but it can
lengthen out into a horror when cut and
gashed by canons and barricaded by thick-
ets of thorny brush and great gravel ridges



those sixty miles up and over down and
through detouring rocky gorges and clam-
bering over craggy precipices doubly ham-
pered by moores injured leg and spades
growing delirium were full of toil and
pain

  the day passed in laborious misery they
traveled possibly fifteen miles in ten agon-
izing hours the night was spent in fitful
sleep and on the morrow they took up their
task moores injury grew steadily more
painful of the three only one carver
was in anything like fair shape

  spade gowdy had long since ceased to
think and traveled erratically battling with
invisible monsters and reptiles his crav-
ing for whisky was only equaled by his
craving for rest he ate almost nothing
and what he did eat he could not assimilate
his figure became emaciated and his mus-
cles responded slowly only occasionally
was his mind rational at such times he
begged piteously for liquor and cursed them
vehemently for their negligence in coming
away without whisky yet he hung in
line staggering awfully to keep up grimly
clinging to the almost forgotten hope of
sharing in the prize that lay in the little
canon of the jackear mountains

  jim moore hobbled at the rear partly
because of his injury but principally to
prevent carver from going on alone there
existed armed peace between moore and
carver with the latter constantly alert to
seize any opportunity to slip off and leave
the slower pair moore was equally vigi-
lant to prevent him each therefore
slept but little

  there were hours when they all suffered
agonies of thirst water was scarce yet it
existed in sufficient quantities that the
travelers might by making miles in futile
search find enough to keep them alive as
they went along for food they cared
little but watef-water they must have
sometimes they came upon water when
their canteens were already full then they
would drink as much as their empty stom-
achs could possibly hold and stagger on
harboring the sloshing fluid in their heavy
canteens for fear of not finding water
again

  then at times they would find water only
after their canteens had long been dry and
their tongues and throats parched and
gummy they would fling themselves
down beside or even in the lifesaving seep


adventure

  and drink and gorge until they lay cramped
  and vomiting upon the sands these were
  not true men of the desert they had lived
  to grow fat from the labor of others

    four days later-the seventh from el oro
  -their search led up a-small canon one
  of hundreds that came down out of the
  jackear mountains following this they
  reached a blind wall a sheer white cliff jut-
  ting abruptly from the canon floor

    carver eyed moore calculatingly

    this is the cliff henry blane told us
  about he said

    sure is replied moore his hand upon
  the butt of his heavy six-shooter go
  ahead

    what about him carver indicated
  spade

    moore indifferently regarded the swollen
  face and dull eyes of the once hearty lead-
  ing citizen of oro gulch spade was be
  yond hope of being able to appreciate the
  great consequences of the moment moores
  -eyes roved over the emaciated puffed
  figure arid he scratched the back of his hand
  reflectively

     hes all in he remarked lightly lets
  leave him here

     all right agreed carver fifty-fifty

     sure fifty-fifty just right

    half a million gloated carver im
  goin up he started to climb

   not too - far ahead of me you

  aint starled moore painfully dragging
  his injured foot into step ill set the pace
  pardner you can go ahead but see to it
  you dont go too fast were close to taw
  an i dont stand for no monkeyin im
  goin to see that my name goes on that
  discovery notice whether we either one of
  us ever makes it back to el oro or not
  sabc

wordlessly they climbed over
  the cliff then for a quarter mile
  they followed the sand wash that
  during the rainy season poured its flood over
  the break behind them rounding one of
  the countless crooks they camc in sight of
  an open glade with a spring and a grassy spot
  about it two burros nodding under the
  thick mesquite put their ears forward in-
  quisitively

    henrys burros exulted carver
  were in the right place henry left his
  jacks at the spring tis only a step to
  the big find

  not so fast there warned moore
im dry that spring looks like a million
dollars to me im goin to drink first

  yis an me too shure im as dhry
as a conthribution box almost ill drink
wid ye

  but we aint goin to run for it

  they approached the spring and flat on
their bellies they drank of the cool trickle
presently moore raised his head and peered
intently at a reflection in the water what
he saw caused him to look about and there
on the side of the huge rock that over-
shadowed and was reflected by the spring
appeared in the big boyish letters they
had learned to know so well

be not deceived god is not mocked

  a few steps farther up the wash where
the cold ashes of a dav-old camp-fire spread
white against the smoke-blackened base a
great boulder bore the holy legend

god giveth power to the faint to them that
have no might he increaseth strength isa 

  in silence the two men stared at each
other moore broke the spell

  if hes up there ill shoot him like killin
sheep he whispered hoarsely jerking his
head in the direction of the ledge

  carver nodded approvingly

  in silence they arose their six-shooters
naked in their hands and stole up the wash
to where a ledge of inestimable richness
cut across the rock-ribbed canon its gleam-
ing content seemingly mocking them in
their utter powerlessness for their quarry
was not there minutely they scanned all
that was visible of the place the rock
monuments and discovery stake placed by
henry blane were in view to the right and
to the left were the neatly erected monu-
ments of another locator on the huge
rounded boulders about the discovery
stake were printed righteous sentences

thou art my hope

exalt ye the lord

  carver stooped to pr a nugget from the
rich vein

  goin to take a sackful inquired
moore himself breaking off a huge chunk
with a stone

  sack nothin exploded carver i
got all i cn do to get back to oro im
out o grub almost regretfully he gazed
three wise men

i

at the vein million he muttered cal-
culating the seamed ledge million if
thot ledge is ten feet deep theres ten mill-
ion

  carver swore and slammed his heavy
gun down among the sand and stones of
the canon floor

  if thot little runt was here now id
shoot im into a million scraps id make
him look like a nickels worth of sausage
shot from a cannon well im goin up

an look at his-location notice mebby

the fool didnt have sense enough to get it
straight at all

  he cursed again vehemently as he strode
across to the location monument

  moore followed together they drew
forth the folded paper from the piled stones
written upon it in a prim stilted hand was
the description according to the legal form
of the location the length and width of
the claim was set forth and the distance
in feet from the point of the notice to each
end of the claim together with the general
course of the claim the date and the local-
ity with reference to the jackear peaks
the name of the claim was set down as
the crazy mans dream and the names
of the locators were recorded therein as

                obadiah higgins
                spade gowdy
                jim moore
                dan carver

  obadiah higgins had made good

  the two men cursed vividly

  hes half-way to the recorder now

roared moore seizing the paper and rend-
ing it into bits but by- if i catch

him before he gits thar therell be one less
name on that paper here carver you
catch up henrys jacks lets see if we
cn make it back to oro i can go without
eatin but i cant hoof it git em lets
go spades done for leave im lay no
dont you try pickin up yore gun im
th gunman now ill teach you how to
shoot a pardner in the legn cripple im
git them jacks

kjjs a week later two patient burros
swayed into el oro dried sweat
stood on their shoulders and flanks
and they sucked thirstily at their lolling
tongues the hair on their backs was
rumpled evidently there had been riders
the day before or perhaps the week before
that straight to the little trough beside
the new well-curb they went and thrust
their parched muzzles gratefully into the
cool water

  henry blane standing protectingly at
the side of obadiah higgins who was con-
versing with a group gathered in front of
the recorders office shaded his eyes with a
gnarled hand

  why he exclaimed surprizedly
thems my burros

  satisfied the two burros stood before the
new well-curb placidly shooing the flies
with their bristly tails above their droop-
ing heads and contentedly waving ears was
the holy reminder-

henty leverage

aulhor of theiron dollar

vhen ivan with the long sur-
name walked down the beach
at novgorod he found three
men these men were sit-
ting on their haunches staring out over the
japan sea ivan spoke to them in english

  i have a ship he said

  the first man glanced at the second the
second stared at the third they rose from
their haunches and wrapped their rags
around gaunt limbs

  a ship in this accursed port asked one

  a bloody lie exclaimed a second cast-
away

  ah hae me doots rasped a third
derelict

  it is a fact gentlemen said ivan with
the long surname the ship is loading
between here and vladivostok she wants
but a master a mate and an engineer

  the three men grew sad they had been
broken on the rack of peace they had
come ashore at novgorod in a leaking sam-
pan the government of japan was at
that moment interested in their where-
abouts

  our papers were lost in a great storm at
sea said the leader of the trio whom men
called micky mcmasters you mind
the vast simoom

  ivan the russian spread out his hands
his great spade-shaped beard fluttered in
the warm japanese breeze he thumped a
be-medaled chest

  come with me he said papers or
no papers-it is you three who shall take
the shongpong out across the sea

  he talks like a poet writes whispered
red landyard a yankee mate to mike
monkey the scotch engineer

  ah hae noo doot hes read a wee bit
how otherwise would he know we were on
the beach at novgorod there is a price
on our heads

  micky mcmasters edged the big russian
away from his whispering companions

  this ship asked the little skipper
this boat you ave loading between ere
and vladivostok-what flag does she fly
her home flag is chinese her crew
are loyal russians her cargo now going
aboard is caravan tea this tea must be
taken to america where victoria on the
island of vancouver is do you know the
route

  micky felt his heart thump like a mallet
inside a cask he had sweated and toiled
and starved on the mud flats of novgorod
he sensed the coming of a bitter winter
and here was a hard-eyed russian offering
him and his mates a ship for the pacific
broadside where white men walked and
roses bloomed and shirts could be worn

  ive steamed and sailed man and boy
he explained going on thirty years im
umber born-at great grimsby on the
north sea my mate the tall man with
the red face is an american out of new
bedford my first engineer came from
tyneside-where they build good ships
we take no back-slack from nobody show
me your ship says i and ill work
er across the japan sea and east by the
line to victoria


assignats



  that is settled said ivan alexandrov-
ski you may come with me

 micky mcmasters gathered the tattered
collar of his dungaree coat around his un-
shaven neck

  one more question before it becomes a
contract he said suspiciously are you
loyal russian or are you bolshevik

  ivan with the long surname smiled
blandly he stroked his straggling beard
he stared down at the little castaway

  loyal russian he said i have a
home in vladivostok-where allied troops
are guarding

  micky turned jerked his head toward his
mates who stood shivering in their rags and
shouted

  the contracts signed a fair thing for
all of us we work the shongpong across
the western pacific

  ye arranged about terms asked mike
monkey siding up to the skipper and glanc-
ing at the russian

  terms

  bonuses and wages

well leave that to our noble friend
mike gulped and spat to the mud flat
last time ah left that he said ah had
nothing coming to me when ah went
ashore

  the russian drew himself erect

  the scale of wages he declared shall
be for you three officers one thousand
rubles a week-paid at victoria

  how much is a ruble asked mike
two shillin hissed the cockney
skipper

  twa shillin that make a hundred
pun a week ah hae noo doot itll be well
earned before the end of the passage
wheres the ship asked red land-
yard show me the shongpong

  the russian led the way up the beach
two hours stiff walking brought the cast-
aways to a cove in which lay a rusty tramp
flying the chinese flag and swarming with
coolies-like ants on a cockroach

  mike monkey stared at the boxes which
the coolies were carrying aboard the
ship

  tay he spat aya it may be tay
and it may be something else them aint
chinese marks on the sides

  russian explained ivan come with
me aboard my ship you can see the boxes
are marked with russian letters

  micky mcmasters jabbed the engineer

in the ribs as they trailed up a shaky gang-
plank and sprang from the shongpongs un-
polished rail at the waist

  be careful he warned dont ask no
bloomin questions  wait till we cross the
sea o japan

  mike gulped he eyed the decrepit
back-stays and standing rigging of the
tramp he ranged a fluttering glance
along the dirty planks of the freighter he
shifted his tongue in his mouth as he
stared at the drunken-looking funnel which
bore evidences of poorly patched shot
holes

  a rum hooker he told red landyard
shes had her name painted out about five
times shes no moren eight hundred tons
if shes that shes a broodin menace ov
some kind ah wash my hands of this
voyage

  youre ands need washin snapped
micky mcmasters drop below and look
over the engines see hif theres any coal
or supplies aboard report to me on the

bridge

  dye call that a bridge mike pointed
forward of the tipsy funnel which was
painted light blue

  hits a better bridge than the mud flats
of novgorod micky said get below
and report im skipper ere

mikes report delivered between
clamps upon a chew of chinese to-
bacco borrowed from a coolie was
tense and bitter

  ye hae no conception of the state of
things below he told micky mcmasters
theres only one double-door boiler it
was made in canton-china the engines
are cross-compound of the vintage of isaac
watt and robert fulton the coal is jap-
anese-twa bunkers of it the stoke-hold
leaks and the shaft-alley is full of bilge
muck ah saw the stuffin-boxes jettin
water myself the last engineer of this
packet wrote wot he thought of it on the
ditty-box door he said enough his
name was macfarland

  whats that got to do with hus

  mike walked from starboard to port of
the tramp he stared down at the fine of
coolies who were staggering aboard under
the last of the boxes he watched the yel-
low hands of the gang in the fore-hold reach
for the cargo he came back to micky
mcmasters


adventure

  wots it got to do with us he re-
peated its got a lot ah doot if we
make japan-let alone victoria

  well try said micky sadly the
russian says we can clear at nightfall e
and is crew are coming aboard then i
tested the steering-gear it works who
got steam up

  three coolies who are sittin in the en-
gine-room waiting to go ashore ah bor-
rowed some cut-plug from them-enough to
last the voyage-if it lasts they cant talk
anything but pidgin english their clothes
are not worth taking-or id of taken
them

  micky mcmasters rubbed a bristly chin
reflectively he stared at mike monkeys
faded outfit he swung his gaze to where
red landyard stood on the forecastle deck
directing a gang of coolies who were clearing
away wreckage which had fallen about the
capstan

  this russian he said with an anxious
dance at the dark outlines of the shore
this man who hired us at a thousand
rubles a week is some kind of a big labor
captain or prince the coolies salute him
the two tatars standing guard at that shed
ashore bowed when he spoke to them
theres a whackin mystery ere

  ah thought ye would get yer foot in it
when ah saw ye chinnin with that russian
on the mud flat he is a smuggler

  no e dont look like one

  looks is only skin deep he ought to
be skinned-with his thousand rubles a
week

   e as nobody to navigate the ship and
the tea as got to be taken hover the western
pacific

  tay ye are daft dye call that
tay

  mike monkey pointed a scornful finger
at the boxes piled around the fore-hatch
he spat to the bridge-deck

  that aint tay thats opium or hashish
or fireworks of some sort ah never saw
tay boxes with russian letters on them
there is good tea grown in some parts of
russia

  its grown aye its grown wots to
prove this cargo growed there it may
have been brought to this cove in a sampan
-it may have been brought in a chinese

junk-it may have-

   vast with your may-haves get be-
low to the boiler ere comes a caravan or

a funeral theyre russians of the prov-
ince of the don see their beards and
their robes theres the big fellow who
hired us es a bloomin juke thats wot
e is kow-tow when e comes aboard
ye told me to go below

  urry hup never mind the kowtowin
you walk straight and take my orders until
we get on the igh seas

  the first engineer fluttered a pair of pale
lashes in the general direction of the squad
of russians who were winding around the
shore shed he climbed down the rusty
bridge-ladder and glided for the engine-room
companion he went through the single
grating and thrust his hands into the broken
pockets of his dungaree trousers as he eyed
the three coolies sitting on the crank-shaft
of the cross-compound engine

  on deck he roared at the chinamen
ye all get on deck and dont show yer mis-
erable faces here again yere discharged
ye built my fires in oriental fashion-up-
side down with all the japanese coal on the
grates ye left me nothing but clinkers and
salt water in the boiler and leaking gaskets
and-

  the last yellow man stared down through
the grating on his way to the deck and
departure

  plenty much you learn by and by he

said softly-too softly plenty much-

  mike picked up a rusty spanner he had
drawn this back when there sounded the
raucous clang of an ancient gong in the
engine-room micky mcmasters wasting
no time had rung for quarter-speed for-
ward before the russian crew were well
aboard

  two men came down the engine-room
ladder in awkward fashion they blinked
at mike they stared at the engine as if it
were an idol in a temple they stroked
their whiskers

  are ye coal-passers asked mike
  passengers

  wot

  we are passengers

  ah asked ye if ye are coal-passers
mike monkey pointed toward the low
door through the bulkhead which separated
the engine-room from the stoke-hold

  get forrard he rasped dye know
the skipper rang for a turn on the engines
dye know theres only thirty pounds ov
steam

  the russians moved toward the stoke-
assignats



hold door mike picked up his spanner and
followed them he spent the next lurid
hour breaking in two green firemen whose
manners were sullen and morose

it was after sundown when the
shongpong clamped from her an-
chorage in the cove and started
eastward over the polished waters of the
japan sea

  a tan-colored moon hung in the sky a
soft breeze swung out from manchuria
the powdered stars spangled the velvet
dome of heaven

  red landyard micky masters and mike
monkey came together on the decrepit
bridge of the freighter like three men mak-
ing a common report

  ivan with the long surname and most of
his following were in the lighted cabin
where rose the quarter-deck of the freighter
a lone lookout stood on the forecastle head
he was smoking a long-stemmed pipe the
ashes from the bowl of this pipe made tinder
of his whiskers now and then he pressed
out the sparks and swore in russian

  a second and sinister figure squatted on
the fore-hatch he had a rifle across his
knees the end of this rifle was tipped
with a polished bayonet

  standin guard said micky mcmas-
per the grand juke put im there to
watch the tea

  tay said mike monkey ye still in-
sist it is tay

  micky squared his jaw i know noth-
ing he said save that we are oldin a
course for akodate and the inland sea
which we should reach this time day after
tomorrow-if the steam dont die out alto-
gether

  red landyard stared at the russian on
the fore-hatch he eyed the bright point
of the steel bayonet

  theyre quiet now he drawled but
were hardly out of sight of land i expect
ill have to chain a man or two before long
the forecastle is a volcano hear them
talking theyre arguing some point in
russian

  micky swung and eyed the break of the
quarter-deck which showed four lighted
port-holes within the smudge of smoke that
draped from the tipsy funnel

  theyre doing the same aft he said
ivan the grand juke is leadin in the
prayin or whatever it is i never saw such

a crew for talking i dont know who are
passengers and who are workin the ship

i wish id studied russian

  wot good would that do asked mike
monkey they wouldnt reveal their se-
cret plans to us wot did they bring the
rifle aboard for wots to prove we aint
shipmates with a howlin bunch of anar-
chists theyre quiet now them twa in
the stoke-hold only look at me and chew on
their beards when ah give orders theyre
waitin for somethin

  micky strode across the bridge he
gazed sadly at the ripples that curved from
the shongpongs straight bow he esti-
mated the speed of the ship to be not more
than seven knots an hour there was no
bridge-rail log	

  he came back to mike monkey and red
landyard

   briefly stated ye said were in the
ands of providence anything is likely to
appen with all that talking fore and aft
the course the grand juke gave me is to the
pacific-by the nearest strait im olding
that course thats all i know i ave a
wife and children at ome i was thinkin
of them when i took the contract to work
this ship to victoria

   mike studied the little skippers dungaree
jacket and unshaven face

  how many russians are there aboard
he asked

   sixty or seventy

   then ah resign if it comes to blows ah
am weak from starving onthe beach of
novgorod all ah have been able to find to
eat on this hooker is caviar and salt fish
ah would as soon eat clinkers

  a door slid open aft a rolling voice
struck forward ivan appeared followed by
two russians they were wrapped to the
beards in great coats trimmed with fur
they climbed the bridge-ladder and stared
at the binnacle

  east she is said micky east a
quarter point north

  ivan swept the sea with a long glance
he nodded and pointed over the freighters
stumpy jib-boom

   japan lays there he questioned micky
   yes habout four undred miles
   have you sighted any ships

  none yet

  if you do call me on deck answer no
signals keep the chinese flag flying
the union jack would look better
adventure

  ivan stroked his beard

  you take my orders he said icily
avoid any suggestions keep away from
smoke sails and particularly gunboats of
foreign powers ill double the thousand
rubles which i have agreed to give you three
officers ill increase it to two thousand
rubles a week

  mike gulped and drew his scrawny neck
deep into his collar he waited until ivan
and the russians had descended tbe bridge-
ladder and walked slowly aft to where the
light streamed from the open cabin door

  ye heard that grated the engineer with
scorn ah thought it was possible to get a
thousand rubles a week ah expect noth-
ing now its too good to be true all
minds the lilqss o that russian it was in
guatemala where i was paid three thousand
pesos a month the pesos were worth six-
pence on the pound

  micky mcmasters shook his head
anyway he said were on the first leg
ome to blighty were gettin a free pass-
age thats something

  mike monkey went below to the clanking
engines red landvard stared forward and
aft he entered the chart-house and turned
in across the single seaweed mattress it
contained

  micky stood the watch until midnight
he woke the yankee mate gave the course
and dropped down into the engine-room
he sat with mike until two bells the
scotch-irish engineer was bitter against the
russians he rose now and then and
peered through the stoke-hold door where a
lurid light glowed

  twa stokers he said and no fire to
speak of

  micky glanced around in caution as the
engineer came back for the third time

  investigate the fore-hold he whispered
find out what is in those tea boxes dont
let anybody see you doing it theres a
plot of some kind aboard this ship

  theyve talked enough for a revolu-
tion

  the little skipper paused on the first
round of the engine-room grating

  get forrard when you can he whis-
pered open one of those boxes

  mike gulped and nodded he drowsed
out the morning hours and climbed to the
deck at the first crack of dawn he waited
all the day for a chance to creep through the
stoke-hold without being detected by the

two russian stokers a second night came
and after night the twinkling lights of the
inland sea no chance afforded itself in
the passage between the japanese islands

  it was morning of the third day when
ivan with the long surname dashed thoughts
of a discovery in the forehold by summon-
ing all hands to the waist of the shongpong

a wild seascape greeted mikes
eyes as he hurried up the engine-
room ladder and braced his spindle
legs athwart the planks

  the duskv outlines of the japanese coast
were fast fading in the west the wind
swung out of a biting north the sea had
been stirred by the tail of a storm the
dingy freighter with her tipsy funnel and
standing rigging rolled and tossed she
threatened to have the two masts out of her
at any moment

  micky mcmaster stood the bridge with
red landvard ivan and all of the rus-
sians including the crowd from the fore-
castle were gathered beneath the shelter of
the quarter-decks lift they glanced at
mike monkey and started chattering in
russian his eyes lifted over their heads
he gulped and moved his adams apple up
and down his scrawny throat he spat to
the deck

  the chinese flag which had been flying
from the jack staff had been replaced by a
red oblong it showed baleful in the rays
of the sun

  mike turned his chin he looked at
micky the little skippers jaw was square
set his shoulders were thrown back
there was a fighting fire in his eyes

  wot happened asked mike shrilly

  our friends are in charge of the ship
said micky over the bridge-rail come up
ere theyre going to take a vote for cap-
tain mate and engineer they say all
things in their government should be settled
by a vote theyre going to elect a citizen
captain

  wot is their government

  micky gripped the rail

  bolshevik he snapped

  mike steadied himself on the wet planks
he spat to the deck for a second time his
glance ranged from the little -skipper to
ivans broad face

  ah thought so he rasped were de-
luded men

  ivan strode from the press of russians
assignats



beneath the break of the quarter-deck
he mounted the main-hatch his voice
rose and fell with the whine of the north
wind he spoke in gusty torrents he
pointed to the red flag aft he turned and
leveled an accusing finger at the bridge
where red landyard and micky stood with
folded arms

  mike squinted at the half-circle of rus-
sians they were being worked up to a
storm by their leader a fur cap was
passed into this was dropped slips of pa-
per upon which were scrawled names a
rifles bayonet lifted above the heads of the
bolsheviki a club swung

  mike leaped for the bridge-ladder and
climbed to the bridge like a frightened ape
he worked his lashless brows up and down
he spat through yellow teeth

  wots the answer wot happened
micky mcmasters sighed he thrust his
hands in his pockets resignedly

  hits hall hup he declared theyre
electing a citizen captain to take my place
theyre voting for an engineer and mate
they say there should be equality on the sea
as well as on the land ere comes hour
substitutes

  mike glared at three russians who had
detached themselves from the others one
was a former coal-passer another had
come aft from the forecastle ivan made
the third

  the russian stood beneath the rocking
bridge and said sternly

  you mutineers get below to the stoke-
hold we will guide the shongpong out
across the pacific we will make our own
report without your aid we need you on
deck no longer

  red landyard snatched up a belaying-
pin from the lee rail

  --you he shouted i signed on

as mate-and ill be mate

  and im captain shrieked micky

  the fight which followed was all one-
sided a hoarse command from ivan was
answered by a determined rush forward
the bolshevik horde swarmed over the
bridge of the wallowing freighter micky
and red landyard fought them tooth and
nail they swung belaying-pins and a
chart-case they finished their end of the
struggle upon their knees-to which posi-
tion they were beaten by the press of num-
bers

  mike considering discretion the better

part of valor managed to creep along the
weather rail and spring for the engine-room
companion he sprawled down the ladder
head foremost he rebounded at the grat-
ing he snatched up a spanner and glared
upward he braced a foot in the pit out of
which flashed the slow-moving cranks of the
cross-compound engines

  his chin described a quarter-circle the
companion-way was darkened by the form
of a man micky still fighting dropped
down and struck the grating red land-
yard was hurled after the little skipper
both seamen had been shorn of most of
their clothes their faces were bleeding
welts showed upon their shoulders

  gorblvme cried micky gorblyme
-give me a hose give me hot water
give me steam

  go easy drawled the yankee mate
squinting at the whiskered faces which
blocked the entire companion theres a
few of them left we didnt kill them all
we ought to spat micky bolshe-
viki theyre red-andcd murderers-thats
wot they are

  thats my opinion said mike monkey
you you sputtered micky where
were you when the fight started

  ah came down here for a pinch bar ah
was just going up when ye joined me-pre-
cipitously

  micky rubbed his bleeding knuckles he
turned a cold shoulder upon the engineer
then stared upward he made faces at the
bolsheviki and shook his broken right fist

  ill avc you know theres a law on the
seas he snapped ill report this outrage
to the next british consul

  ivan pushed away the men about the
companion he descended two rungs of
the iron ladder turned and sneered into the
gloom of the engine-room

  you are to remain below he said coldly
get steam up and give us full speed you
will be thrown overboard if you do not
obey my orders the citizen captain so
directs me

  wheres me twa thousand rubles
shouted mike monkey coom down here
-ye scum of the steepies coom down
ivan started descending he thought
better of the action when mike snatched up
an iron bar and brandished it with agility

  coom down ye bolshevik dog coom
down if ye dare

  ivan called in russian a ferocious face


adventure

appeared over the edge of the companion
the sharp point of a bayonet extended into
plain view the muzzle of the rifle de-
flected until it was directly aimed at mike

  he dropped the iron bar to the grating
he held up his hands

  that lets me out he cried through
chattering teeth dont shoot

  go forward ivan ordered you and
the american go forward and put coal on the
fires you mcmasters attend to the en-
gines none of you three men will be al-
lowed on deck you will all be shot if you
do not keep the ship moving at full speed
those are die orders of the citizen captain
micky picked up an oil can he squirted
a stream at the nearest crank

  steam on the engine he said to mike
and red

 the two castaways went through the
stoke-hold doorway the shovels grated on
the iron apron before the double fire-boxes
a biting scotch oath rolled into the engine-
room micky eyed the steam-gage on the
main steam pipe it was climbing he
glanced upward the ferocious russian
was standing guard with the rifle ivan had
disappeared

days passed in unending drudg-
ery food was lowered down at
the end of a line the sentry was
changed each watch ivan kept away from
the companion though his voice was
heard in loud argument concerning the posi-
tion of the freighter micky stripped to his
sweating waist and smarting from the blows
he had received grinned through the
knuckle-thick bristle on his lips

  he kept the engines oiled he saw to it
that the throttle-wheel was wide open
once he relieved mike at passing coal the
ship made progress of a kind it was evi-
dent that the citizen captain had headed for
the center of the north pacific there was
little danger of a lee shore

  and may he wander like the flyin
dutchman said mike monkey onthe six-
teenth day ah hope hes lost

  no said red landyard hes heading
somewhere the course is always east i
can tell by the sun he hasnt changed a
quarter point

 micky mcmasters glared at his two
mates they resembled stokers of hades
their skin was blistered the callouses on
their hands had become small cushions

the fighting fire in their eyes alone remained
to remind the little cockney skipper what
manner of men they were and had been

  the plot said micky is thick and ard
to fathom for why are they eadin to the
states or canada no one wants them
over there theyll run their bloody eads
hinto a noose

  mike monkey cocked a grease-lined ear
he blinked

  ye hear them chatterin he asked
theyre sea lawyers ah hae hopes they
start to massacre themselves

micky rubbed the bristles on his chin
well reach land in a day or two he
said then well find out the answer for
the boxes of tea and the voyage and the
other questions

  tay exclaimed mike ye always
said it was tay this looks like a tay party

it-it-

  the scotch-irish engineers statement was
broken by the appearance of ivans bulky
form in the companion the russian came
down to the grating the sentry pointed
the rifle at the group mike dodged be-
neath the forward bulkhead door and waited
there with bent head

  mcmasters called ivan come here
mcmasters

  micky folded his arms across his hairy
breast and stared at the russian

  what dyou want he asked

  ivan peered through the engine-room
gloom

  we have decided he said heavily that
you can join us as a brother we have
voted on it we will make you rich you
can be one of us

  id rather be a dirty stoker than one of
your breed replied micky

  we are going to give you a chance
you can help us navigate to our port of call
the citizen captain is not sure of his exact
position assist us to obtain a reading and
we will honor you by admission to the be-
nevolent order of reds we intend to raise
one billion dollars in canada and the united
states we shall give you a share in it

  to - with you and your billion

micky screamed brandishing a broken fist
get hout of the gangway

  ye did right whispered mike as ivan
climbed hurriedly through the engine-room
companion and disappeared on deck ye
were not to be bribed by the scum o russia
wots the answer to the billion dollars
assignats



  micky stared at the point of the bayonet
which crossed the sky over his head he
glanced at the flashing cranks of the cross-
compound engines he raised his voice
above the noise of their wallowing passage

  the answer is this he snapped
theyre going to victoria and canada to
raise a revolution there are a lot of bol-
sheviki in iding-from victoria to the at-
lantic seaboard this is a plot to start
somethin against law and order ill
smash that big grand juke with a ammer
the next time e talks to me es insulted
a british seaman-e as

  mike shot a crafty glance at the stoke-
hold door he scratched his greasy neck

  a plot he said ah hae noo doot we
can nip it in the bud all we got to do is to
open the bilge-cocks and drown the rats
and we go down with them

  aye

  micky shook his head

  were not martyrs he suggested cut-
tingly there may be a better way to get
rid of the scum of siberia

  set the hooker on fire

  well roast with it

  ahll think it over then

  mike monkey disappeared through the
bulkhead door micky watched the en-
gines for a long minute he raised his eyes
and saw a shadow cross the companion
opening a second bayonet joined the first
ivan had posted two guards to watch the
three men between decks the big rus-
sian also signaled for more speed he was
answered by oaths from mike monkey and
red landyard

a long hot day passed the
heat of the stoke-hold and engine-
room was a tiling to remember
the three castaways sweated beneath the
menace of the two bayonets and ivans bru-
tal oaths the sounds from the deck were
those of a madhouse it was evident that
the citizen captain did not know his position
on the ocean once the shongpong headed
due south her course was changed to
northeast she steadied and clamped on-
ward holding an uncertain path

  night brought some relief from the heat
the japan current was swinging along the
american shore a breeze sprang up the
ship rolled lurid oaths from the russians
came down the rusty ventilators this was
music to the castaways ears

  midnight and eight bells brought diver-
sion running feet sounded on the ships
planks a muffled cannon-shot echoed
from the distance a shell burst over the
freighters rigging

  clanging bells for more speed drove
micky from the engine-room into the stoke-
hold

  a gunboat lie exclaimed were be-
ing chased

  ah thought we would be rasped mike
monkey shall ah draw the fires

  the engineers question was answered by
a curdling oath from ivan the leader of
the bolsehviki descended to the stoke-hold
door he peered through the gloom

  you heard the bells he snarled through
his beard you all die if you dont keep up
steam were going to escape from the
cutter fortunately it is an old one

  micky mcmasters shook his head toward
his two mates he followed the russian
into the engine-room and picked up an oil-
can as ivan motioned for the sentries to get
on deck a silence fell upon the brooding
ocean

  red landyard appeared between the
stoke-hold and the engine-room he braced
his legs and toyed with a short iron bar
now and then he stared forward to where
the crimson light glowed from the fire doors
the steam mounted in the gages mike
monkey worked alone the scotch-irish
engineer had evolved an idea out of the sit-
uation he had sent red to the stoke-hold
door in order to stand guard

  what is e doing asked micky in a
whisper

  sist said the yankee pretend to oil
the engines and keep busy dont let the
sentries suspect anything watch the steam
its going up to the bursting point

  micky watched the gage on the main
steam leader it started climbing from
one hundred and seventy to one hundred
and ninety it went over the two hundred
mark it dropped and mounted again

  the little cockney skipper heard the fire
doors clanging a baleful light streamed
past red landyard a roar sounded in the
single funnel it was as if the ship were
equipped with a double-fan forced draft
the cross-compound engine spun like a
turbine

  whats e putting on the fires ques-
tioned micky

  the tea
o

adventure

  the what

  the boxes of tea in the forehold
husked red we broke through and
looked the bolshevik cargo over its com-
bustible all right

 tnt

  nope look out that sentry is cock-
ing his gun duck aft dont let him see
you talking with me

  micky crawled down the narrow shaft-
alley he sat on the thrust block and
searched his heated brain for an answer to
mikes energy hours later he heard the
scraping of rocks and shale under the
shongpongs keel the ship heeled and
plunged on her bow crashed upon a
shelving beach the bolsheviki cursed a
mast went by the board it splintered the
deck the funnel fell with its load of soot
the engine-room filled with choking smoke

  mike monkey burst through this pall
he started mounting the ladder to the com-
panion red and micky followed the en-
gineer they stood on deck and ranged
their smarting eyes over a desperate scene

  the citizen captain of the shongpong had
found his port of call-a wooded cove on
vancouver island in his zeal at the dis-
covery of the rendezvous he had neglected
to stop the ship the freighter lay with a
seven-degree list to starboard her deck
was a mass of wreckage from fallen standing
rigging mast and funnel above this mlee
of twisted lines and back-stays and smoking
ventilators towered ivan of the long sur-
name his great spade-shaped beard lifted on
high

  his followers swarmed around him on the
tottering bridge a red light showed
through the tall stems of fir-trees this
liglit moved as a signal a score of furtive
shadows flitted in the underbrush at the
head of the cove russian faces stared out
over the shoal waters of the rendezvous a
shout of brotherhood passed between ship
and shore

  coom on whispered mike monkey to
micky and the yankee seaman coom
aft theyre too busy forrard to notice us
well lower the dingey and escapc

  the cockney skipper climbed over the
deserted quarter-deck and loosened the
falls he dropped the bow of the small
boat into the waves that curled astern of
the grounded freighter red landyard
lowered the after part of the dingey the
three castaways found oars they rowed
for a dark cape that struck out into the
cove they gained the beach of this point
and staggered ashore they turned and
stared at the canted freighter

  see said mike monkey theyre
opening the fore-hold ah wish them luck
in wot they find beneath the hatch

  micky squinted through the gloom he
discerned dancing figures on the deck of the
shongpong a bloodthirsty yell of baffled
rage rose to the western stars it was
echoed by the conspirators ashore

  ah hae noo doot mike monkey rasped
they found ah had burned all the tay
didnt old whiskers ask us to keep the fires
burning hot and nice ah kept them burn-
ing-at a price ah put all of the tay boxes
through the fire doors theres none left
what was in them asked micky
mike closed a lashless eyelid he drew a
greasy handful of papers from beneath his
shirt he offered them to the little skipper

  rubles he said bolshevik bonds
and rubles they were bringing them to
canada and the states ah hae an idea
they were going to sell them to the reds in
both countries all ah know to be sure is-
there aint no rubles left ah found them
better to burn than the miserable slag called
japanese coal

  micky saw a light he squareset his un-
shaven chin and pointed south along the
coast

  well walk the beach he said until we
come to a coast guard no doubt the cut-
ter that chased the bolsheviki is nosin
around well show it where to go

  mike thrust his ruble notes back within
his shirt

  ahll keep these he declared they
aint worth a hapenny but theyre what we
can expect to get for wages if the reds start
runnin the governments

lieoe

author of the lavender letter godfather to satans kitchen ek

ye sat before a brushwood fire in
the mildewed stone fireplace of a
moss-covered old cabin low on
the breast of big blue smoky
night had fallen a chilling summer thun-
derstorm was just passing the crest of its
fury he was alone and lonesome he had
made the fire for light for comfort for com-
panionship-all three on his knee lay a
battered brown violin and in his right hand
he held motionless a homemade sourwood
bow his topaz eyes were fastened on the
glowing coals there he saw a picture of a
slender young woman barefooted and
dressed in a simple garment of calico whose
leaf-brown hair hung in a single plait

  there came a keen clap of thunder like a
farewell message of defiance from the pass-
ing storm and fiddlin jim straight-
ened smiled a little and lifted his fiddle to
his chin he started to play more or less
imperfectly schuberts incomparable sere-
nade which he had learned from the prison
chaplains phonograph when his born-
woodsmans eyes fell upon a tiling that he
had not before noticed it was a tiling the
average person would never have noticed

  one of the worn flat stones of the mil-
dewed hearth had recently been moved

  jim braden put his fiddle down and knelt
at the hearth another momen t and he had
taken out the loose stone still another mo-
ment and he held in his two hands a wallet
of black leather which contained nearly two
thousand dollars in paper money of half a
dozen denominations it represented more
than a fortune to fiddlin jim he stared

at it in amazement then he laughed softly
to himself he closed the wallet and thrust
it into a rear pocket of his trousers replaced
the stone sat down on the soap-box chair
that was the only bit of furniture the old
cabin had and took up liis beloved fiddle

      before he could lay bow to
fstrngj however the door creaked
open on its wooden hinges and he
half turned his head to see a slip of a bare-
footed boy standing on the threshold his
clothing soaking wet and dripping his slight
body shaking from the chill

  whatever on earth cried jim braden

  quickly but with a great tenderness he put
the battered brown violin on the floor close
beside the soap-box chair

  come on in son come up to the fire
my heavens but it shorely is cold here on
big blue smoky even in the summer-time
a follerin one o these lightnin starms

  he threw more brushwood to the flames
which licked hungrily at the fresh fuel

  the boy advanced gingerly stopped at the
edge of the hearth and soberly looked the
other over from head to foot he saw a
man of not more than thirty-four a tall
straight muscular man whose features were
strikingly rugged and strong and yet kindly
whose eyes were unmistakably those of a
dreamer of dreams

  the man saw in the lad a good deal of
himself the small new-comer had a deter-
mined mouth and chin and his eyes too
were those of one who knew both the build-
ing and the destroying of castles in the air


adventure

he was sunburnt and freckled and his hair
was of the yellowish-white color that is the
result of living in the open without a hat

  fiddlin jim did not strive to connect
the presence of the boy with the money he
had just uncovered he rose went to the
door and closed it took off his old wrinkled
moth-eaten coat returned to the fire and sat
down

  shed them wet cloes son he drawled
good-naturedly and put on this whilst
yere a waitin fo ye cloes to dry

  he held the coat out to the fire to warm it
the boy eyed him stolidly and silently for a
long minute then he turned his back to jim
braden unbuttoned a few buttons and let
his faded waist and short jeans trousers fall
to the floor he looked a slim beautiful
pale bronze statue of enviable youth jim
braden draped the little figure with his coat
turned its face toward him and buttoned the
garment all the way the boy smiled
faintly in his gratitude to the good samari-
tan spread his wet clothing out in order
that it would dry quicker and sat down on
the hearth

  im much obleeged to ye shore he
said finally i got lost in the starm and i

garrulousness the chaplain-it was him

the coat closer about his bare legs how

fiddlin jims face showed a big new
interest

called bad lot which used to wear ring-
lets on his forrard jest to make people laugh

braden what-how-how come it lot
named ye that son

  dunno zackly but i think he used to
have a friend named jim braden mebbe
whats yore name mister

 me

  fiddlin jim was again staring at a picture
in the glowing coals he saw the slender
barefooted young woman in calico he saw
himself he saw lot hupple his friend and
he saw dana the young woman turn from
hupple and go with him following this
there came the officers the accusation trial
by judge and jury and finally imprison-
ment-all within a few months after his
marriage to dana

  my name he drawled absently is jest
jim fiddlin jim then he asked what
jest jim fiddlin jim



was ye mothers name son and is she yit a-
livin

  dana and shes yit a-livin

  dana

  fiddlin jim sat stiffly upright on the
soap-box chair he had never known an-
other dana then he believed he under-
stood his wife had married bad lot
hupple his friend after the cataclysm
bad lot had thought enough of him jim
braden to name his son for him it was
good of hupple to do it

  he had heard in prison ten years before
that dana was dead somebody he didnt
remember who had written the chaplain to
that effect and the chaplain had told him
he hadnt known how to read and write and
neither had dana no message therefore
had passed between them after his being
sent to the states prison the fact that
she was still living and married to lot
hupple-he hadnt the least doubt of it-
came as a very great surprize to him and he
was so intensely human that he hardly
knew at the first whether to be sorry or
glad

  but when a full realization of the thing
had broken upon him he looked up as
the chaplain had taught him and was glad

once more the cabin door creaked
suddenly open and there stepped
across the rotting sill a big man a
goliath of a man smooth-faced and sun-
burnt almost to the hue of weathered cop-
per he wore ill arranged and straggling
jet-black ringlets of hair on his forehead
and his countenance branded him as one
most sorely distraught fiddlin jim recog-
nized him immediately rose and went to-
ard him with outstretched hand

  hlo lot he cricd shorely am glad
to see ye old friend

  hupple had recognized braden before en-
tering the cabin otherwise he would not
have entered he took bradens hand and
pressed it half reluctantly then dropped it

  whats the matter wi ye lot smiled
fiddlin jim how come it yere so pest-
ered in ye mind old friend

  bad lot the goliath didnt answer he
took two short staggering steps backward
as do dark villains of the footlights jim
braden went on

  ye shorely aint drunk lot he was
still smiling his topaz eyes were sparkling
in the firelight didnt ye know its as

much fun to play off drunk as it is to ack-
shully be drunk and a feller dont have no
habbergosh taste in his mouth nor no head-
ache in his head the next mornin honest
whats wrong old friend

  its the law fiddlin hupple ex-
claimed his voice hoarse and a little shaken

im in a mess i-

  he broke off and turned toward the open-
mouthed boy on the hearth

  whatre you a-doin yere little jim
he demanded

  the answer came quietly readily
mother sent me to look ye up pap she
said to tell ye bill freer and three other
men is a-watchin the house and fo you not
to come home ontel she gi ye a sign by
hangin a white cloth on the cedar in the
front yard where she usually hangs the
wash

  bad lot clenched his hands and swore
under his breath he looked toward the
now deeply concerned face of fiddlin jim
tell me about it bad braden urged
hupple turned to the sober-eyed little
jim he did not notice that the lad wore
fiddlin jims old coat braden and the lad
themselves had forgotten it for the moment

  son said hupple sneak down to the
creek that runs jest below here and yell find
a path a-takin square out to the left along
the bank put ye feet in that path and
i tll carry ye home tell ye mother i onder-
stand hurry up son

  the boy rose and slipped obediently into
the night bad lot crumpled to the soap-
box chair

  i didnt want him to hear fiddlin
hupple began im a-goin to tell ye
everything fiddlin it was thisawav
you know how it alius was wi me i
was borned onder a bad star seems like

adventure

  well you know how it is when a mans
repitation is bad its awful easy to hang
any sort o crime on his head and a man has
to pull a crooked deal sometimes to git his
due to come to the kyernel o the mat-
ter fiddlin i was cused o shootin and

  dana cried bad lot hupple its a
worryin her to death

  fiddlin jim rubbed his chin thought-
fully bent his head folded his arms and
began to pace the floor its a-worryin
her to death still rang in his ears it must
be true he reasoned a woman like dana
wouldnt live with a man for so long if she
didnt love him

  after some two minutes of thinking
braden drew up before hupple who now sat
with his face buried in his hands

  ye did rob the cattle-buyer bad said
he and ye brung the money here and hid
it in the hearth

  rupple gave no sign that he had heard
but he had inwardly he winced

  ye did rob the cattle-buyer bad re-
peated jim braden

  bad lot straightened on the soap-box

  i aint said i didnt did i aint a

long suits looking people squarely in the
eye

  you know dana said he do ye
think shed live wi me fo ten years ef she
didnt love me answer me that fiddlin
it was along the line of bradens own rea-
soning braden nodded he was satis-
fied he leaned slightly forward and put a
hand on hupples shoulder

fiddlin

shift the blame are ye a-promisin me
faithful bad

  am i

  hupple went to his feet he seized
fiddlin jims hand and wrung it and gave
his word with a rather fearful oath

       just then there came a tiny noise
from the darkness outside it was
 the breaking of a wet bit of rotting
wood jim braden snatched up the boys
sodden clothing and flung it over the bed of
coals in the fireplace plunging the interior of
the cabin into total darkness another
second and the door creaked on its wooden
hinges and the blinding white rays of an
electric flashlight fell full on fiddlin jims
startled countenance

  up with em-quick boomed the voice
of sheriff bill freer grab the roof lot
grab er

  braden put up his hands a deputy
slipped from the darkness and snapped
manacles over bradens wrists

  search him ordered freer

  the deputy obeyed with alacrity he
found the cattle-buyers wallet in fiddlin
jims pocket and tossed it to the sheriffs
feet fiddlin jim looked to his right and
to his left bad lot was not in the cabin
then bradens gaze fell upon the one win-
dow and he knew hupple had escaped

  he aint got any gun said the deputy
and it aint lot hupple

  i see it aint freer replied pick up
that wallet and see if mcautrys name is on
it

  the deputy held the wallet to the light
yes he nodded john b mcautry
its ffill o bank-notes

  freer stared hard at jim braden whom
he had never seen before

  how come you wi this pardner he
asked gruffly
jest jim fiddlin jim



  fiddlin jim forced himself to smile
for the sake of his friend dana and the
boy he set his feet in the path of sacrifice

  i reckon the games up fo me he said
slowly i reckon i might as well confess
and be done with it i held up and robbed
john b mcautry but i didnt mean to
shoot him honest the gun went off acci-
dently mr sheriff

  whats yore name pardner

  jim

  jim what

  jest jim fiddlin jim said braden
therest dont matter

  freer holstered his revolver took the
john b mcautry wallet from the hands of
his assistant glanced into it and thrust it
into his pocket then he stepped heavily
toward his prisoner the soap-box chair
was in his way he kicked it aside

  look out braden bellowed my
fiddle-dont ye step on that fiddle

  immediately there was the crashing and
splintering of dry wood the officers foot had
inadvertently demolished the battered but
much-loved old instrument it put fid-
dlin jim clean beside himself he sprang at
freer like an enraged panther his manacled
wrists notwithstanding and drove a knee
hard to freers stomach there came a roar
from the revolver of the deputy who didnt
quite understand and jim braden crumpled
to the floor across the poor remains of his
fiddle and lay there very still

      fiddlin jim sat up and looked
jp about him it was daylight it
was in fact around the middle of
the afternoon he was in a perfectly spot-
less white bed on the log walls of the
room hung pictures in homemade black-
walnut frames that seemed somehow fa-
miliar at his right was a homemade table
and on it were a broken vase filled with
mountain flowers and a very beautiful
orange-colored violin on the floor beside
the table sat a boy he had a barlow knife
in his hand and he was busily making a
water flutter-wheel of old cornstalks it
was little jim braden

  a door opened and a woman half buxom
and pretty but somewhat worn and anxious
looking entered the room it all seemed
queer the woman saw that he was sitting
up and she hurried to him

  jim she said eagerly how do ye feel
now



  he recognized her when she spoke it
was dana she sat down on the side of his
bed and with a wonderfully gentle hand
touched the white bandage that was about
his temples yes it was dana lot hup-
ples wife he was a little dazed yet but he
knew that much

  wheres the sheriff he muttered
and what come o the irons that was on
my wrists

  bill freers gone back to the lowland
answered dana and she smiled upon him
thes nothin agin ye now jim bill
freer said he was awful sorry he busted up
ye fiddle and he brung ye a new one see it
there on the table

  braden nodded

  wheres lot

  dead

  dead

  dead-and buried dana showed no
sign of grief

  how come that asked braden

  bill freer had to shoot him in self-de-
fense freer didnt believe it when you
said it was you robbed john mcautry
he went straight on after lot and he
got him afore dinner-time o the next
day

  fiddlin jim bent his bandaged head and
tried hard to remember more clearly

  how long have i been here dana
moren four days the doctor said the
bullet broke the bone above ye left temple
he said ye had brain fever or somethin
and he said ef ye come to yed be might
nigh shore to make it and ye have jim
thank god

  she choked there was a little period of
silence the boy dropped his barlow knife
and climbed to his knees at the bedside he
watched his mother and big jim braden
wonderingly then braden spoke again
so lots cashed up pore old lot
did ye love him dana

  no said dana i told him i didnt
and never would when i married him i
married him cause he was yore friend-that
is i thought he was-and cause i couldnt
make it a-workin by myself and cause lot

but ive got to do it

  jim lot owned up to everything afore

  my own boy gasped braden

  take my word fo it begged dana

count up how old he is and-and every-
thing jim do ye want me back now
fiddlin jim turned his eyes shining topaz
eyes upward his kindly rugged face
seemed somehow glorified dana was afraid
perhaps she thought it was his delirium
again

  what is it jim honey dahlin she half
whispered her voice that of the eternal
mother what is it ye see

  nothin much smiled the man who had
learned fine lessons of life behind the iron
bars of a prison i was jest a-lookin up
to see where the acorns conies from

by berton braley

little islands tucked away down under the line-kipling

      theres an island somewhere down below the line

its an island that ive never even seen

       where the level beach is delicate and fine

and the sea is like an opal blue and green

oh the long tides ebb and flow there and im simply sick to go there
where the phosphorescent combers glow and shine

and the cockatoos are screaming and the tropic stars are gleaming
       on an island somewhere down below the line

       i am harnessed in the yoke of everyday

i am fettered to the humdrum and the dull

      but my thoughts are always wandering away
      on the highroad of the eagle and the gull

far away from care and canker theres a dream ship drops her anchor
       in a blue lagoon of coraline design

and a slow tide gently heaves me and a dream boat takes and leaves me
       on an island somewhere down below the line

there i swing a golden hammock and a breeze

brings the heavy scent of jungle-growth and bloom

and the coconuts are falling from the trees

and i hear the far-off breakers roar and boom

its a dream of drowsy beauty that is kept from me by duty

       its a glamour never never to be mine

but i still can hold the vision of a loafing-spot elysian
on an island somewhere down below the line

  halamb

author of the rider of the gray horse the skull of shirzad mir etc

  put cloth of gold upon a fool and a multitude will
do reverence to him clothe a wise man in beggars
garments and few will honor him yet those few
will have their reward-turkestan proverb

ve were three men with two
horses and two swords we
were outcasts in the thickets
of the foot-hills of badakshan
under the peaks of the roof of the world
we had earned the wrath of the mogul of
india and there were two thousand riders
searching for us

  it was the year of the ox-the year 
by the christian calendar-and jani beg
the uzbek had taken badakshan from my
lord baber shirzad mir sometimes called
the tiger lord

  nevertheless we three were happy
we had taken shirzad mir from the hands
of jani beg who had marked him for death

  aye shirzad mir sat in the clean white
robes in which he had prepared to die by a
twisted bowstring around the neck and
laughed for joy of seeing the sun cast its
level darts of light over the peaks and
through the trees that gave us shelter
our hearts-the ferangs and mine-were
lifted up for a moment by the warmth that
comes with early morning we had an
ache in our bellies for lack of food we had
not slept for a day and a night also i was
stiff with many bruises

  tell me said shirzad mir fingering
his full beard which was half gray half
black how you got me out of the prison
of khanjut

while i watched lying at the edge of
the thicket on my side the ferang-the
englishman sir ralph weyand-explained
how we had climbed through the water
tunnel of khanjut into the walls and how
we two alone had freed the mir while jani
beg and his men were tricked into looking
the other way by a herd of cattle that we
had sent to the gate of khanjut

  he spoke in his broken mogholi but
shirzad mir who was quick of wit under-
stood

  and whence came you he asked

  sir weyand told how he had been sent
to india as a merchant and had been
driven from the court of the mogul by the
wiles of the portuguese priests when he
had done shirzad mir rose up and touched
his hand to earth then pressed the back
of it to his brow this is something he has
seldom done being a chieftain by birth
and a proud man sir weyand rose also
and made salutation after the manner of his
country

  i watched from the comer of my eye
for my curiosity was still great concerning
the ferang also for all he had borne him-
self like a brave man that night he was
but a merchant and i knew not how far
we could trust him while i lay on the
earth and scanned the groups of horsemen
that scurried the plain below us seeking
for our tracks the thought came to me
that our fortunes were desperate

  we were alone the followers of shirzad
mir were scattered through badakshan or




adventure

slain the family of my lord was in the
hands of jani beg-upon whom may the
curse of god fall to the north of badak-
shan we would find none but usbeks
enemies to the east was the nest of bleak
mountains called by some the hindu-kush
by others the roof of the world to the
west the desert

  true to the south the shyr pass led
to the fertile plain of kabul but up this
pass was coming said afzel the son of
jani beg with a large caravan i had
heard that said afzel was a poor warrior
being a youth more fond of sporting with
the women of his harem and with poets
than of handling a sword still he had
followers with him for he was bearing the
gifts of the mogul jahangir from agra to
jani beg

  something of this must also have been in
the mind of shirzad mir who had been lord
of badakshan for twice ten years during
the reign in india of the mogul akbar-
peace be on his name

  i am ruler he smiled sadly of naught
save two paces of forest land my dress
of honor is a robe of death for a court
i have but two friends

  shirzad mir was a broad man with
kindly eyes and a full beard he had
strength in his hands to break the ribs of a
man and he could shoot an arrow with
wonderful skill he was hasty of temper
but generous and lacking suspicion be-
cause of this last he had lost badakshan
to jani beg the uzbek

  he knew only a little of writing and
music still he was a born leader of men
perhaps because there was nothing he
ordered them to do that he would not do
himself wherefore he had two saber cuts
on his head and a spear gash across the
ribs

  thinking to comfort him i rose up from
the place where i was watching and squatted
down by them

  there are many in badakshan i said-
long ago he had granted me leave to be
familiar with him-who will come to you
when they know you are alive

  who will tell them abdul dost he
asked mildly we will be hunted through
the hills the most part of the nobles of
badakshan have joined the standard of
jani beg

  the men of the hills and the deserts
edge are faithful shirzad mir i said

  they were herdsmen and outlaws for
the most part our trained soldiers had
been slain all but a few hiding out in the
hills

  aye he exclaimed and his brown eyes
brightened still they are but men
to take up arms against the uzbeks we
need arms-also good horses supplies and
treasure have we these

 so we talked together in low tones
tfa thinking that the ferang slept or
did not hear presently i learned
that he understood for with many pains
he had taught himself our tongue

  we spoke of the position of jani beg
truly it was a strong one he himself
held khanjut which was the citadel at the
end of the shyr ravine leading into india
paluwan chan leader of his usbeks was
at the great town of balkh with a garrison
reinforcements were coming through the
passes to the north from turkestan out-
posts were scattered through the plains
jani beg was a shrewd commander only
once did i know him to err badly in his
plans of that i will tell in due time

  shirzad mir who was brave to the point
of folly said he would go somehow to agra
and appeal for mercy from jahangir himself
i had been to kabul and i knew that the
intrigues of jani beg had made his quarrel
seem that of the mogul and-such is the
witchery of evil words-shirzad mir seem
to be a rebel

  that may not be i answered

  then the ferang lifted his yellow head
and spoke in his deep voice

  i heard at agra shirzad mir he said
weighing his words that you were a
follower of the mogul akbar

  of akbar nodded my lord the
shadow of god and prince of princes
he was a soldier among many

  so it has been told me sir weyand
rested his chin on his fists and stared up
where the blue sky of badakshan showed
through the trees when akbar was in
difficulty what plan did he follow

  he was a brave man god put a plan
into his head when it was needed he
had the wisdom of books and many ad-
visors

  and with this wisdom i have heard
he always did one thing when he was pressed
by great numbers of enemies

  shirzad mir looked thoughtfully at the
said afzels elephant



 ferang it was a strange thing that this
 merchant who carried a straight sword and
 came over the sea in a boat should know
 of the great akbar verily wisdom travels
 hidden ways

    aye he said the mogul akbar would
  say to his men that they should attack-
  always attack

    then repeated sir weyand promptly
 we will attack it is the best plan

   i threw back my head and laughed
 how should the three of us with but two
 horses ride against the army of jani beg
 how should we draw our reins against
 khan jut we should be slain as a lamp is
 blown out in the wind a glance from
 shirzad mir who frowned silenced me
 when i was about to put this thought into
 speech

    how he asked still frowning

    then i remembered that i also had asked
  this question of the ferang and that his
  answer had freed shirzad mir i drew
  closer to listen

   in my country said sir weyand
 there is a saying that he who attacks is
 twice armed

   he then told how an ameer of spain
 whose empire extended over ferangistan
 and the lands across the western ocean
 had sent a fleet of a thousand ships against
 england in sir weyands youth and how
 the queen of england had fitted out a
 much smaller fleet dispatching it to sail
 against the invader

   had we waited for the spaniards on
 s land the issue might have been different
 he said as it was few of the dons
 escaped with a whole skin the advantages
 of those attacking are these they can
 chose the ground best suited to them they
 can strike when they are ready also their
 numbers appear greater in a charge or
 onset

   the thought came to me that perhaps
 the ferang being a bold man would not
 hesitate to turn against us if the chance
 offered after all he had been sent by
 his king to get money and trade conces-
 sions from india and the small province
 of badakshan could mean little to him
 what did we know of the king of england-
 except that he had ships and very fine
 artillery

    still at this time sir weyand needed the
  friendship of shirzad mir and although
  he was a merchant-which is a getter of

money-he never in the weeks to come
and i watched closely shunned the dangers
we faced instead he welcomed a battle
and laughed when he swung his long sword
as if he were about to go to a feast it is
written that a fight is like a cup of strong
wine to some sir weyand was such a
man

  true nodded shirzad mir who had
listened with care the great mogul akbar
once when his men were wavering went
forward on his elephant to a knoll where
all could see him then he ordered his
attendants to shackle the legs of the ele-
phant with an iron chain so that he could
not retreat whereupon his men rode
forward and the battle was won yet
we are only three against as many thou-
sands in what quarter should we at-
tack

  aye i put in where we are not
yet mad

  we are like to be so from hunger or
thirst replied the ferang if we do not
better our fortunes i heard you say we
had no place to flee and so we must at-
tack

  khanjut smiled shirzad mir almost
mockingly

  but the ferang was not in jest

  if we had a few score followers it would
not be a bad plan but that is for you
to decide shirzad mir you know the
country if i think of a plan i will tell
you

  that was all he had in his mind i was
disappointed perhaps i had expected too
much of him

  meanwhile we must eat i pointed out
feeling the urge in my stomach iskander
khan will surely give us food also weapons
if he has any

  i did not add that my horse was at the
aul of iskander khan last night i had
ridden a wild ass from khanjut but i did
not want to do so again-until my bruises
healed

  it is well said shirzad mir

  so he mounted one horse and the ferang
the other i trotted before them to spy
out if the way was safe iskander khan
was the friend who had aided us with his
herd of cattle and his two sons the night
before his anl was hidden in the hills
not far away but as we traveled we
did not think to find what was awaiting us
there


adventure

ii

       about the time of noonday pray-
bjpp ers we came to the kirghiz aul-
 three dome-shaped tents of willow
laths covered with greased felt and hides
over the opening of the biggest tent were
yaks tails also an antelopes head under
this sat iskander khan cross-legged on the
ground

  he was a very old man bent in the back
with the broad forehead and keen eyes of his
race and a white beard that fell below his
chest his eyes were very bright and his
skin had shriveled overnight his turban
was disarranged as if he had torn it in
grief

  he rose unsteadily to his feet when he
saw shirzad mir but my lord-because
iskander khan had rendered him a great
service and because the kirghiz was the
older man-sprang down from his horse
and went to meet him iskander-khan
touched his hand to the earth and to his
forehead three times then shirzad mir
embraced him

  we have come for food i said looking
for wind-of-the-hills but seeing him not

  iskander khan lifted his hands in despair
and pointed to the empty huts

  it is my sorrow he said that shirzad
mir of badakshan should come to my aid
and ask meat when i have none to give
there is kumiss in the cask and this i will
bring you

  he did so filling a bowl with the mares
milk which is the distilled drink of the
kirghiz neither shirzad mir nor i liked
kumiss when we saw how disappointed
iskander khan was at our refusal we
forced ourselves to drink some as it
happened this was well because the strong
fluid eased the pang in our insides

  shirzad mir glanced curiously about the
vacant aul in the days when he had
known iskander khan the kirghiz had
many sheep and cattle

  then iskander khan told us what had
happened the herd and flock which
his sons had driven to the gate of khanjut
had been taken by jani beg who was
greatly angered at the trick we had played
on him also the two boys and the
daughter of iskander khan had been taken
by the uzbek horsemen

  one of the youths jani beg had impaled
on a spear which was then fastened to the

gate of khanjut the other kirghiz had
been shot in the stomach with a matchlock
ball and thrown from the walls of the
citadel

  the girl jani beg had had flayed alive
iskander khan had been too feeble to ride
with his sons news of what happened
had been brought him by a khirghiz sheep-
boy who saw truly a heavy sorrow had
been laid on the khan for what he had done
for shirzad mir

  my lord put his hand on the arm of
iskander khan and spoke softly

  it is written that what evil-doers store
up for themselves they shall taste you
shall have revenge for the death of your
sons by the beard of the prophet i
swear it

  he felt at the peak of his turban for the
jewel he had been accustomed to wear
there intending to give it to iskander khan
as a token he smiled ruefully when his
hand met naught but the cloth the
small turban of white cotton he wore was
part of his grave clothes

  truly iskander khan he meditated
aloud i am a beggared monarch i have
not even a token to give you for this
service

  i am content shirzad mir

  i thought of the riches that the poet son
of jani beg was carrying to khanjut from
the mogul jahangir while shirzad mir
had not so much as a spare horse and i
voiced this thought being embittered by
hunger and much soreness at this the
ferang sprang to his feet so swiftly that i
thought he had seen some uzbeks approach-
ing so i did likewise he clapped me on the
back rudely

  ha abdul dost he cried that is the
word i have been waiting for so the
caravan of said afzel is now in the shyr
pass here is our chance we will attack
said afzel

  ride against two score when we are
but three i laughed at the man if he
was mad i must see to it that shirzad mir
did not suffer from his folly i was in
kabul three days ago and said afzel was
just setting out besides his slaves and
personal servants he has a bodyguard of
some pathans they are well armed the
pass is narrow also they have many
camels you know not what you say
peace abdul dost called my lord
whose eyes had taken on a strange sparkle
said afzels elephant



you have not wit to see farther than your
horses ears let the ferang speak

  it is better to be mad than calm at this
time when caution will gain us nothing
excellency said sir weyand respectfully
here is a noble chance said afzel does
not yet know you have escaped he will
not be watchful of danger his caravan
may be numerous but it is made up for -the
most part of women and eunuchs more-
over in the narrow ravine they must
extend their line of march we can choose

our place of attack-

  and they will dig our graves there
i said

  shirzad mir frowned at me

  and we will have the advantage of
surprize continued the ferang jani
beg will hardly think to send reinforce-
ments to his son because he knows that
said afzel is well attended we will have
time to gain the narrow point of the pass
just before dark-the best time to strike
how can three horsemen ride against
camels and an elephant in a ravine i
asked for i was not to be silenced

  shirzad mir was foolhardy of his life and
it was plain to me he liked well the words
of sir weyand

  we will not ride against them abdul
dost if you had thought you would re-
member that we could stand on the ridge
above the caravan trail where our arrows
will command said afzels men

  it was true i had not thought of that
in my concern for shirzad mir it angered
me-a mansabdar of the army-to be
corrected by a foreign merchant and i was
silent for a space not so the tiger lord

  ilai-that was well said he cried
such a plan warms my heart now if
we had the strong sons of iskander
khan- he broke off with a glance at the
mourning kirghiz what men and slaves
are with the caravan

  i heard at kabul replied the ferang
settling his tall body against the tent
that said afzel was a courtier and a
gallant-fond of music toys verses and
the indian dancing girls he is bringing
a throng of such with him also several
camel loads of treasure as gift from the
mogul what do we care for eunuchs and
ethiopian slaves

  said afzel has at least seven pathans
with him i reminded him they are
good fighters

  are you an old nurse abdul dost
cried my master in great anger speak
again and i will set you to tend swine
he turned to the ferang said afzel
is truly called the dreamer sir weyand
he is the most elegant in dress and can
recite verses as well as his boon companion
kasim kirlas the professional courtier

it is true that he travels with cumberous
baggage-unlike his father-and is usually
stupefied with bhang and opium i would
risk much to set hand on his jewels

  we would risk much nodded the
ferang bluntly as was his custom espe-
cially as there is one of the big indian ele-
phants in the caravan

  an elephant shirzad mir clapped his
stout hands and laughed  ilai-an ele-
phant that would be most alast from
the stables of jahangir i heard it said
at khanjut when i was prisoner verily
the star of our good fortune is in the
ascendant

  i thought the madness that had come
upon sir weyand had bitten my lord
for he laughed again and fell to talking
in low tones to the other i strained my
ears but could not hear being angry and
perhaps a little jealous i withdrew slightly
to show them i did not care what they said

  once shirzad mir called to iskander
khan

  have you a great cauldron he asked
the khirghiz pointed to the ashes of
the fire where a pot stood large enough to
boil a sheep whole

  will you give it me

  iskander khan made a sign to show
that all he had was shirzad mirs for the
asking once more the two talked together
and i saw them glance at me and laugh
then iskander khan lifted up his white
head

  you will need a good horse shirzad
mir he said slowly the one you have
is a sorry pony in a thicket yonder i have
abdul dosts horse also an arab stallion
that has carried me for five years i will
fetch it for you so that you may mount as is
fitting for a king

  the eyes of the tiger lord softened
thrice happy is the man who has a 
faithful friend he said and with his own
hand helped the aged kirghiz to rise

  before the two left the tent to go for the
horses he spoke quickly to sir weyand

  the ferang rose and stretched his big


adventure

frame i did not move for they had not
confided in me he disappeared into the
tent and presently came forth lugging a
basket filled with something heavy i
wanted to see what was in it but i would
not show him that i was curious

  he was singing to himself after his
strange fashion he moved with his hands
that which was in the basket and put it in
the cauldron i watched him

  when he had nearly finished there came
a dog that was hungry and whined seeing
the dog sir weyand threw him a piece of
the stuff he was handling the dog wagged
his tail and carried off the stuff i saw him
eat it

  this was very strange so i rose up with-
out seeming to be interested and walked
toward sir weyand until i could see into
the pot

    billah i cried for the stuff was rotting
swines flesh which it is defilement for a
follower of the prophet to touch it had
been used by iskander khan to grease the
tents the ferang who knew this laughed

  tell me abdul dost he smiled rising
from his lalxr when the pot was nearly full
is that dog better than you or are you
better than that dog

  he was a caphar one without faith
those words might well have cost him his
life

  if i have faith i answered him sternly
i am better than that dog if i have not
faith he is better than i i laid a hand

on my sword if you wish a quarrel-

  peace cried the voice of shirzad mir
behind us it is time we mounted

  he was leading a fine gray stallion and
iskander khan had wind-of-the-hills
likewise the kirghiz gave to us two good
bows and quivers full of arrows-also he
brought his own sword from the tent and
girded it on shirzad mir what man could
do more than iskander khan did for us

  the blessing of god go with you shirzad
mir he said in parting i shall stay at

this tent and perhaps-

  i will come back said my lord swiftly
i will not forget

  we watched the bent form of the old man
go into the empty tent then we set spurs
to our mounts the cauldron sir weyand
had slung on a long pole one end of which
he carried and i the other shirzad mir
rode bridle to bridle with him-i following
behind still they talked together eagerly

like boys with a new sport once sir
weyand looked back at me and grinned

  if you are afraid to come abdul dost
he said you are free to drop the pole
and go

  before i could think of a fitting answer
he was speaking again with shirzad mir
verily i was angered the pole leaped
and jumped and i was forced to watch
lest the vile fat should fly out on me
there was no doubt in my mind that lack
of food had unsettled my lords brain

  why else should we ride at a fast trot
through the hot ravines of the hills to the
shyr pass where at any moment we might
meet a wandering patrol on the watch for
us and why did we carry that accursed
pigs flesh

  as for sir weyand my brain was black
with anger i wanted to swing my scimitar
against his long sword had it not been
for the events of that evening i should have
done so

      our horses were steaming when
we came out of a poplar thicket
on a hill near the caravan track and
saw a boy shepherd watching us from his
flock when he recognized shirzad mir
the lad put down his bow and dropped to
his knees

  hazaret salametl he cried joyfully in
the dialect of his tribe

  he had thought shirzad mir was dead
my lord questioned him swiftly the boy
told him that the caravan of said afzel
had not yet passed this point our good
fortune still held yet i was doubtful of
what was to come shirzad mir bent over
the boy

  speak little soldier he laughed how
would you like to shoot an arrow in the
service of your lord

  the boys eyes brightened and he fingered
his bow being both pleased and shy with
the attention paid him he was a slight
dark-skinned kirghiz-the same that had
visited iskander khans aid-and the
words delighted him shirzad mir honored
him by taking him up behind on his horse
my belly yearned for the mutton that we
might have cooked and eaten but my
master would not linger

  it was midafternoon and the sun was
very hot we were in the pass now and
once we met a runner coming up the ravine
it was a man of said afzel and when he
said afzels elephant



saw us he bounded up into the rocks but
shirzad mir fired an arrow swiftly my
lord was an excellent shot from the body
we took the message

  it said that said afzel would camp that
night at a certain level spot in the pass
for the caravan track was too narrow
besides being on the bank of the turbulent
stream amu daria to travel at night
probably said afzel liked better to sit on
the cushions of a silk tent than to ride

  god is good to us exclaimed shirzad
mir and pressed forward

   although i still said nothing i had a great
foreboding no man has ever called me
a coward but our strength was sapped by
hunger-we had no armor or firearms we
were acting on the mad whim of the ferang
and for the first time in his life my master
had put aside my advice for anothers-
that of the merchant who made me carry
the pot of swine-flesh

  we passed the open place where said
afzel had planned to camp we knew now
that the caravan could not be far away
and shirzad mir sent the boy ahead to spy
he ran swiftly like a young mountain goat

  we came to the very place where i had
first met the ferang and i bent my ears
back like a horse listening for hoofs on
the trail behind us for here we were in a
trap on one side the cliff rose sheer for
perhaps four spear lengths on the left
hand the slope steep and strewn with
rocks and thorns dropped abruptly to the
rushing stream which was deep enough to
drown a man

  truly i thought the madness of sir
weyand had brought us to an evil place
if a patrol of uzbek horsemen should come
behind us we would be caught between them
and the caravan

  even a brave man feels a prickling of the
flesh when he knows not what is before and
behind him the mad fantasy of the other
two had veiled their minds from danger
shirzad mir to make matters worse set
sir weyand and me to rolling some stones
into the path from the slope while we
were doing this he dismounted and led our
three horses by a roundabout path up to
the top of the cliff

  not until we had the stone heap nearly
the height of a man and were panting from
the toil-my bruises had not yet healed-
did he call for us to cease then sir
weyand made me take the pole with him

and carry it up the slope to the top of the
cliff if the foul fat had fallen back on me
i should have struck him but it was my
fate that it did not

  back into a cedar grove we carried the
accursed thing here shirzad mir had
kindled a fire from dried cedar branches

  the trees may hide the smoke he said
quick-our time is little

  as if possessed of a demon sir weyand
worked at the fire placing the cauldron
over the logs so that the fat began to heat
meanwhile shirzad mir stood at the edge
of the cliff to watch for the coming of the
boy

  the sun had dropped behind the peaks at
our backs there was no wind the scent
of the cedars was sweet in my nostrils but
sir weyand made me labor over the evil-
smelling pot i had none of his wild hope
for without doubt said afzel whom we
sought would ride the elephant and i had
once tried to attack one of the beasts in a
battle

  the ravine in which the stream muttered
was clothed in shadows and it must have
been the time of sunset prayers when the
boy came running back up the path looking
for us

  shirzad mir called to him and the youth
came nimbly up the cliff clinging somehow
to the sheer rock until my lord reached
him a hand then he bowed his head to
shirzad mirs feet

  the caravan comes lord of badakshan
he cried eloquently

  how many and in what order asked
shirzad mir swiftly

  some horsemen riding slowly are in
front then a group of slaves with burdens
on foot following them some armed
riders then a black elephant with a
glittering howdah

  god is with us cried shirzad mir
he turned to me merrily ho-abdul
dost of the dark brow what think you
of an elephant in the ravine of shyr

  we had seen none of the beasts in
badakshan before but something of shirzad
mirs purpose flashed on me and i felt the
heart-leap of the hunter when he sees game
approach his hiding-place sir weyand
stirred the fat which was now boiling and
bubbling odorously

  above the place where we had piled the
stones so they would look as if they had
fallen down the slope my lord sent the boy


adventure

with his arrows he himself took his
bow and crawled forward to where he
could see him down the pass

  at a sign from sir weyand i helped him
lift the cauldron from the fire by its stick
we carried it to the edge of the ravine

  go with your master said sir weyand
to me under his breath and take your
bow i will manage the rest of my task
alone

 nothing loath i obeyed crouching
beside shirzad mir i could see the caravan
coming up the pass in the quiet of the
evening the bearers and camelmen were
pushing ahead with loud cries for the
camping-placewas just around a turn

it was a brave sight the
pathans as the boy had said were
in the lead-lean men riding easily
and fully armed next came the ethi-
opians with their heavy burdens they
of course were unarmed i counted seven
pathans

  then appeared most alast the elephant
of the mogul he had two red stripes
down his forehead and silver bells at his
neck i could see the white herons plume
of said afzel in the howdah behind the
mahout slowly slowly they came for-
ward

  it could not be better abdul dost
cried my master joyfully

  i took heart from this for though his
eyes were shining he was laughing to him-
self which was a good sign he was not
mad i had begun to see his plan

  last came the long-haired camels bearing
the women the baskets which probably
contained the treasure and the eunuch
guards of the harem a few slaves in
gorgeous tunics walked with the dirty
camelmen

  a lone pathan brought up the rear i
felt shirzad mirs hand on my arm

  shoot your arrows among the camel-
men abdul dost he said i will take
care of the leading riders-i and the boy
when i shout raise our battle-cry and
shout as if you were many men

  i nodded to show that i understood i
strung my bow and waited lying on my
belly it was just as if shirzad mir and
i were stalking antelope yet never had
we stalked such game as this

  the sun had left the pass but there was
still light when the pathans passed under

us and arrived at the heap of stones after
talking together three of them dismounted
and began to clear away the stones drop-
ping them down the slope into the stream
to free the path for the elephant

  we four were silent on the cliff though
i could hear sir weyand working at the
fire the swaying howdah of most alast
came nearer-so near i could see the jewels
set in the turban of said afzel who was
laughing with a fat man on the cushion
by him-kasim kirlas i thought i could
have almost reached down and touched their
heads

  then shirzad mir bellowed his battle-cry

  hai-shirzad el kadr-hail

  he leaped to his feet and began to speed
arrows down at the riders

  hai-shirzad el kadrl i echoed twang-
ing a shaft among the camels

  it must have reached its mark for one of
the beasts yelled with pain i heard the
shrill shout of the boy and the startled
cries of the slaves below us

  then sir weyand came to my side

  st george for england he cried i
asked him later what it was and he told me

  as he shouted he pushed the cauldron
over on its side the boiling fat fell on the
broad rump of most alast

  an elephant has a thick hide but he is
sensitive and nervous as a woman-and
the boiling grease was very hot most
alast lifted up his trunk and bellowed his
pain then he charged forward the
howdah with said afzel and kasim kirlas
slipped its girths as most alast shook him-
self-the fat had missed the howdah to my
sorrow-and the two went to earth

  then most alast dashed among the
riders several horses leaped over the
slope in their fright finding himself
against the stones the elephant turned in
the narrow path and charged back against
the camels which gave way before him
some stumbled into the brush of the slope
others pressed against the cliff wall bil-
lah there was much confusion

  the camels being frightened and hurt
began to yell also and the horses too
the black slaves had leaped to shelter and
stood watching their eyeballs showing
white the camelmen sought safety where
they could

  shirzad mir had reckoned well what
havoc an angered elephant would make
along that narrow path
said afzels elephant



  i was a middling shot with a bow but
my lord was a marksman among many
his shafts sought out the pathans who
had no time to use their matchlocks before
they had to leap out of the way of most
alast yet he killed none before long
i knew why

  eai-shirzad el kadr-hail cried my
lord for the last time and ordered me to
seek the horses

  while the boy plied his arrows from the
cliff we two with the ferang rode rapidly
down until our horses stood at the slope
above the pile of stones here shirzad mir
called upon the pathans to throw down their
arms

  a pathan is a good fighter when and if
it suits him these men were less afraid
of us than of most alast who was trumpet-
ing back and forth along the path heedless
of the efforts of his mahout they saw that
we were armed and ready they did not
know how many more of us there were

  three of the pathans were hurt by the
arrows of shirzad mir two others had
fallen among the rocks and thorns of the
slope below the other two were afoot
and watching the elephant

  all who could do so put down their mus-
kets and swords and said that they had had
enough of the affair shirzad mir would
not move until he had seen the two who
were in the thorn thicket climb out curs-
ing but little the worse for their fall and
join the others then we left sir weyand
who had picked up a brace of their dis-
carded pistols to watch the group and
went forward with me at his side

  find said afzel he ordered me

  i saw the uzbek prince leaning tutbanless
against a rock feeling of himself tenderly
it is no light thing to fall from the howdah
of an elephant kasim kirlas the pro-
fessional courtier was stretched on the
ground at his feet-but this was no salaam
the man was stunned

  shirzad mir caught the dazed prince by
the shoulder and bade him sternly walk
before his horse my lord had drawn his
sword and this he kept near the bare neck
of said afzel

  where is the elephant he asked me

  i pointed to the stream below and
shirzad mir laughed aloud he ever
appreciated a good jest most alast had
smelled water and had somehow got him-
self down the slope to the stream unhurt

he was drawing water up in his trunk and
squirting it over his sore back-mahout
and all later most alast lay down in
the mud it was many hours before we
could get him to leave it

  shirzad mir pushed through the be-
wildered bearers swiftly half of the
camelmen had lied one or two of the
eunuchs drew their scimitars when my lord
came near the camels on which were the
women but when they saw the plight of
said afzel with my lords sword at his ear
they threw down their weapons

  it was a sorry gathering that we grouped
against the cliff wall eunuchs and slaves
are masters of brave words but i have yet
to see the ones who will face danger to their
bodies without shrinking i cast about
and discovered that the pathan who had
formed the rear guard had fled

  shirzad mir was now master of the field
he called to the boy on the cliff-our foes
thought that many more were there-to
shoot down the first man of the caravan who
moved from his place

  then he ordered me to ride my horse
slowly back and forth among the remaining
camels the women and their attendants
and see that none escaped

  it was now growing dark so of my own
will i set four of the camelmen to building
a great fire at the lower end of the caravan
and another by the heap of stones so it
happened that when it grew dark we had
our prisoners securely between the two fires
and could see all that passed

  shirzad mir had gone straight to the
pathans and talked with them a long time
presently he came to me and said

  they will join my party being men who
sell their swords for this reason i did
not slay them they were near enough
for good shooting i have cared for those
who were hurt the others are cooking
food in the morning we will give them a
sword apiece-perhaps

  with the other attendants we did not
speak they were men of low breeding
and jumped to obey our orders shirzad
mir kept said afzel ever at his side in case
of treachery

  one at a time we ate of the food for
which we yearned the boy joined us
proudly and shirzad mir set him to collect-
ing the few weapons of the eunuchs of
these he made a pile and sat on it feeling
greatly the honor we did him


adventure

  shirzad mir talked with said afzel
through the night there was no chance
for me to sleep but i think sir weyand
slept a little during his watch over the
pathans before dawn i had spoken with
the mahout of most alast and given him a
handful of gold from the treasure bags
he-one master being as good as another-
consented to serve us

  at dawn i had finished my task the
loads were all recovered and placed on the
camels and the slaves backs all had
eaten the women were put back on
their camels and the eunuchs herded in
front

  at first break of light in the sky we set
out my lord and said afzel mounted on
the elephant who was now quiet the in-
jured in litters borne by the slaves the
pathans on their own horses and the sheep-
boy on another

  we struck away from the shyr pass into
the hills then for the first time in two
days and nights i slept a little in the saddle
being weary but only a little

ill

said i not our star was in the
ascendant so that for a space we
were given strength to trick our
enemies later evil fortune came upon
us again but not then

  three courses were open to my lord
he could slay said afzel to strike terror
into the uzbeks he could exchange the
prince and the women for his own family
and perhaps a strip of badakshan or he
could ransom our prisoners for gold with
which to pay an army i urged the first
plan sir weyand the second and the
pathans who had now cast their fortunes
with us the third

  our danger was great for when news
of what had happened in the pass reached
khanjut by way of some escaped bearers
the whole army of jani beg was sent to
hunt us down as yet we had no followers
other than the four uninjured pathans and
the sheep boy whom shirzad mir appointed
heacf of the camelmen and gave a sword
to his great satisfaction the bearers the
slaves and the camel-drivers were useless
to us and would have been glad to fall again
into the hands of jani beg who would not
drive them through the by-paths of the
hills as we did

  it is written in the annals of india the
curious thing that my master did in this
difficulty

  we will keep the prisoners and the
treasure he said and we will regain the
foot-hills of badakshan from jani beg
also we will gather together a small army

  and this thing we did by the will of god
how was it done we held a durbar-
that is a crowning ceremony the people
of badakshan had been told my lord was
dead the durbar showed them he was not

  verily not before or since has such a
durbar been held in hindustan or badak-
shan or turkestan we traveled with
the caravan through the villages of the
hills at each village shirzad mir would
dismount from most alast and spend
money-from the bags of said afzel-for a
feast

  wine he bought freely and food and
scattered silver among the people so that
all might see he held his durbar said
afzel the opium-eating prince he forced to
do homage in public to him fat kasim
kirlas the professional courtier shirzad
mir made pay him extravagant com-
pliments el ghias the buffoon of the
caravan performed his tricks the musi-
cians of said afzel sang-at the sword
points of the pathans-and the dancing
girls danced it was a great feast shirzad
mir looking the proud king he was by
birth sat on cushions under a cloth-of-gold
tent which we found in the baggage and
watched idly saying nothing

  sir weyand cleaned his soiled garments
and sat at the right hand of shirzad mir
as the ambassador from england only
i did not attend for at every feast i was
out in the lookout places with certain men
of the hills who rallied to our standard
keeping watch the men of jani beg
pressed us close we moved each day
marching in the night to a new village i
kept a good watch and at each new place
more of our men came in to see and hear
for rumors of what had happened spread
through the hills shirzad mir gave to
them gold and weapons from the store we
had taken

  in the plain of badakshan we could not
have avoided being overtaken by the
cavalry of the uzbeks but in the hills
they were at a loss-and the people aided
us it was a mad scheme yet its very mad-
ness protected us
oh lordy lordy



  he himself put on the jewels he took
from said afzel and-sitting placidly on
most alast the black elephant with the
two crimson stripes of the mogul on his
nose-he looked the king he was the
hearts of his old soldiers who thronged to
us from the hills were uplifted at this sight

  always shirzad mir directed me to
travel in a circle through anderab ghori
and bamian back to where we had started
at the shyr pass in spite of danger he
did this and we all wondered until one day
we came to the desolate aid of iskander
khan as shirzad mir had planned

  when the old kirghiz chieftain came
forth and lifted up his hands at the sight
shirzad mir in his gorgeous robes dis-
mounted from most alast and embraced
iskander khan while we all watched

  then my lord pointed to the caravans
to the camels the treasure and the women

  choose said he to iskander khan
it is all yours for the asking

  but iskander khan would not saying
that he was unworthy of such honor
whereupon shirzad mir called for us all
to see he loaded the horse iskander khan
had given him in his need-the fine arab
stallion-with pots of gold and gems and
put the bridle in the kirghiz hand
himself

  he put a robe of ceremony on iskander
khan and girded on him the sword from
his own waist

  this man he said loudly shall be
always at my left hand until he dies those
who do homage to me shall bow to him
also

  in this manner did shirzad mir pay his
debt to iskander khan he was a good
man a man among ten thousand aye
among ten times ten thousand

the time he turned his loving nature loose on
a three-hundred-pound squarehead young
lady with her features all in the middle of
her face and a figure so graceful she
looked the same anywhere you stood

  her name was susy svenson and her pa
owned a claim back of baldy one day
when andy and me were riding in from the
blue creek range we stopped for the night
at ole svensons from that fatal moment
as the man says his loving nature like to
been the death of andy

  after supper him and susy got almighty
friendly-she could cook like a house afire-
and nothing must do the lady but shes got


adventure

to take andy into the setting-room and show
him the photograph album which is
squarehead for a large evening

  after a while the lamp went out or some-
thing and susy made a mistake in the dark
missed the chair shes aiming for and sat
down on top of andy this was too much
for the self-respect of andys chair it
busted simultaneous and the floor is next
the jar overset a fancy clock weighing
six pounds and a quarter off the chimney
shelf and the same fetched andy a healthy
swipe square between the eyes taking the
lady and the clock together thisaway
knocked andy cold like a mule had kicked
him

  it took thirty minutes and half the tank
to bring him to

  lets go he snuffles in my ear when
hes able to stand lets go-now

  but going away aint so simple as he says
it he made the mistake of calling good-
by before hes topped his horse and susy
reached the upper gate first go i guess
not i skoll gass not

  i ban like you andy she says looking
like a stuffed tent in the moonlight and not
minding me a-tall more better you stay
un talk to your leetle susy

  we gotta be pulling our freight pro-
tests andy starting to swing up quick

  susy reached out one hand to his collar
and he stopped just as quick

  lats go in de house she says with a
smile you could button behind her ears and
giving him a playful shake that made his
teeth rattle  ban make you some
kaffee

  if it had been poison she was fixing to
feed him he couldnt have gone along more
reluctant

  by hal says ole looking after em
i tank i lose mein leetle gal

  ill bet andy wishes he could i says
unthinking

  he ban like her huh asks ole missing
the point a mile

  how can lie help it says i love at
first sight ole thats what

  yaw yaw says he vigorous i gas
mabbe i find me gude cook somevare pretty

-quick

  ole and me tracked along up to the house
going by the kitchen i looked in the win-
dow theres andy sitting on a chair in
the corner and grinding the coffee like he
hadnt a minute to lose

  by yiminy susy was saying i skoll
teach you how to cook

  andy didnt say nothing but he sure
looked jo-awful faint and despairing

  susy brought coffee to ole and me out on
the porch but her and andy had theirs in
the kitchen soon ole went to the corral
and i turned in for the night im sleeping
fine when andy woke me up slumping down
on the bed

  oh lordy lordy says he under his
breath propping his head on his hands
whats the matter i asks him
whatsa matter he gasps in a whisper
whatsa matter say bill- changing
his tone abrupt- what am i gonna do
whatcha talking about i grins

  she-she-that female thinks were en-
gaged he bubbles out

  aint you i says

  no i aint he snaps

  well i says i thought you was i
thought your falling through that chair
together was a new way of announcing it
shucks yes i thought so ole he thought
so and susy she thought so what could
be fairer than that

  but he paid no attention

  she thinks im gonna marry her he
groans batting his eyes desperate

  im stringing my chips with hers i
told him yessir i sure am if she says
youre gonna marry her youre gonna
no two ways about that

  not so loud he shushes at me
theyll hear you my gawd bill he
rants on hanging to his trouble like a bull-
dog to somebodys pants i didnt even tell
her i liked her i didnt act mushy nor
soft a-tall i wouldnt mind if i had id
have it coming to me then but i hardly
put my arm around her moren part
way

  which was doing right well at that
i says even for a long-armed gent like
you

  i tell you i didnt mean nothing he
insists i was just having pity on the
poor girl like i didnt think-bill i cant
marry her i cant look at her just
look at her why its plumb ridiculous
i choked off a laugh and he snarls
thats right make fun o me i
thought you was a friend o mine will
you do this much tell em in the morn-
ing you aint seen me

-	sure i says why
oh lordy lordy



  im drifting out of here soons they get
some harder asleep he explains pulling off
his boots slow and gentle

  yeah i says i would

 what makes your voice sound so
funny he wants to know suspicious as a
weasel

  ohnothing i told him turning over on
my stomach sos he couldnt see my face
cause the moonlight through the window
was light as a lamp and him talking so
confident of going away was surely a joke
id looked out the window before i went to
bed and he hadnt-yet

  andy reached out the makings and
smoked lugubrious for a half-hour then
he picked up his boots and tiptoed to the
window i watched him swing one leg over
the sill and i watched him pull it back

  whats the matter i asks him

  nothing he whispers without turning
round good doggie he goes on flapping
a friendly hand outdoors good feller

  i got up and looked over his shoulder

  i see the dogs still there i says casual
i noticed him just before i went to bed

  andy grunted and looked anxious at the
animal it aint much smaller than a good-
sized calf and its unfolded every tooth in
its head and growling without a break

  didnt you know ole had a dog i
asks andy he keeps it chained out in the
kennel back of the corral as a rule he
must have turned it loose tonight for some
reason

  you think so says andy youre
real bright for a young fellow good dog-
gie he switches to the animal and started
to crawl out the window again

  r-r-r-r-uff roars the good doggie and
sprung at the window

  andy fell back inside and cussed so i
turned in-to sleep this trip i woke up
sudden to see andy sliding out the window
slow and cautious she was two hours
later by the moonlight on the floor and i
got up and went to the window i watched
andy his boots in his hand a tiptoein for
the corral the good doggie was nowhere
in sight you better believe and the corral
was only fifty yards away

  andy was half-way to the bars when
theres a howl at the back of the house and
a black streak shot round the corner and
took after andy

  andy didnt dally he dropped his boots
and ran like a jack-rabbit but for all his

head start he only reached the corral a nose
to the good andy didnt climb the gate
he just sort of throwed himself at it and
before you could wink hes jack-knifed over
and up and was roosting all safe on top the
posts and that dog was capering round
below a-uttering the most frightful roars i
ever heard andy was sure stuck because
ole had built his corral as stingy as possible
and the bars were so wide apart the dog
could sift through most anywheres he
wanted i saw him do it in seven different
places just while i stood there

  i looked for ole and susy to wake up and
rescue the rooster but they didnt-rescue
him i mean ole woke up all right cause i
heard a snicker two windows down it
wasnt my place me being a guest and all
to go calling off no dog as big as a calf even
to please a friend nawsir i went back
to bed and the last  heard before i fell
asleep was andy calling the dog names and
the dog a-worrying and a-teasing andys
boots all to little flinders

  next morning i was up in time to see
susy dragging the dog to his kennel and
andy climbing down mighty stiff and slow
and looking after the dog every move he
makes

  das night air ban bad for folks says
susy at breakfast spading fried mush out
of the pan mabbe you catch cold huh
andy

  but andy he hadnt caught cold only a
splinter which made him sit sideways and
he scraped up a nervous smile to go with
his no susy that would have fooled
most anybody when she told him to
come see her soon his face got as long as a
well-rope

  id like to susy honest he says
im gonna miss you like my right eye but
were so busy shipping feeders just now i
dont see how i can manage it right soon
you can see how it is susy

  i tank more better you come she re-
peats

  i tank so too says ole and he wiped
his mouth on his sleeve got up from the
table reached a  winchester off the hooks
behind the stove and begun to clean it

riding away from oles place
andy was blue and silent a lot
being in his socks thataway-for
them boots wasnt worth saving for patches
when the dog had finished with em-and


adventure

that bad night on top of his other troubles
sure combined to give him a discouraged
appearance

  whatll i do he says at last my
gawd whatll i do now

  you might drown yourself i says
tapping my nose judicious or shoot your-
self or eat wolf-pizen theres forty ways
of committing suicide

  aw youre as helpful as a broken leg
he whines wriggling like the saddle burnt
him this is serious

  you said it was ridiculous a while back
i says

  with that he shut up and didnt say noth-
ing till were almost back to the ranch

  id take it as a favor says he stiff as
dry rawhide if youll keep whats hap-
pened under your hat

  you wont mind if i tell johnny i
asks cocking my eye at him

  not johnny he busts out whatever
you do dont tell johnny

  everybody knows johnnys tongue is
hung in the middle and flapping eternal
johnny what johnny wouldnt do to that
piece of news with his sense of humor-
oh lordy lordy

  i aint gonna say nothing i told andy
but whynt you drag it quit the range
go off someers and dont never come
back

  theres my claim he objects one
hundred and sixty acres almost proved up
and that hundred and sixty i bought off
riley and that jag o cows i got running
with the old mans bunch go off someers
and lose it all youre talking foolish
you could sell all that stuff i suggests
i couldnt get nothing for it says he
you never can at a forced sale

  andy was always forehanded yes in-
deedy not that he was exactly tight
yunderstand but with all his fool love-
making he never lost sight of the fact that
there was a hundred cents to the dollar
corral-count

  thats whatsa matter he goes on
she knows about that land and them
cattle theyre what shes after she
thinks im a good thing shes a-fixing to
trap me

  fixing i says well anyway andy
old-timer i tacks on lets hope ole is a
poor shot

  he was still cussing when we passed the
windmill

  andy didnt eat much supper that night
next morning the same so it went for
three days then when nothing hap-
pened and no signs of susy or ole he began
to chipper up and relish his meals

  the fourth day was monday tuesday
the old man sent johnny with a message to
jake dawson at blue creek saturday he
come back and pounced down on us at
supper

  congrats bawls johnny slapping
andy so hard between the shoulders he
lost control of a mouthful of coffee and got
the hiccups immediate congrats y
old fox whynt you tell us you was en-
gaged to lil susy

 huh- andy- susy- susy sven-
son

  them punchers went loony demented
and what they didnt do to andy no
good for him to deny everything which
he done vehement no good a-tall he
didnt eat no more supper he took him-
self and his hiccups out to the woodpile and
sat down on the chopping-block

  he must have done a power of thinking
out on that chopping-block cause next day
at dinner when johnny got funny some
more andy jumped him prompt as a split-
second fuse

  johnny was so took by surprize that
andy hit him three times before he could
start johnny got a-going final but one of
them three cracks of andys was a right to
the chin and that had tuckered him at the
go-off he didnt have a chance inside of
four minutes hes licked an hollering-
uncle uncle leggo my ear

  andy unclamped his teeth and got up
off johnny

  listen says andy to the rest of the
boys enough is a-plenty i like a joke
but i got my own notion of whats wit and
humor and the next jigger that unloads
congratulations on to me or sticks susy into
the conversation anywheres wants to come
a-running cause i will

  nobody says a word and he went out
to the windmill to slosh water on the eye
johnny had closed for him

       two days later rileys young one
fetched over a letter for andy
andy took it like its a hot coal
whatcha grinning at he grunts to
rileys kid

  i was just a-thinkin says the young
oh lordy lordy



one how you and susy musta looked
when the chair busted

  shut up says andy flushing red as
paint and then the young one near laughed
his fool head off and pulled his freight

  i seen thompson running to head off the
young one at the lower gate but i didnt
let on pretty soon andy slid over to me

  susys coming here next week says
andy shaking the letter she says if i
wont come to see her shell come to see me
what kind o girl is she pursuing a gent
thisaway wheres her pride why cant
she take a hint why cant she lemme
alone coming here her and ole
and raaybe faithful fido i chipped
in but he never noticed

  lookit bill he wades on breathless
you gotta help me youre the only
friend i got in this nest o lunatics they
all think its funny funny my gawd
them jacks would laugh at a lynchin

-it all i dont wanna leave but i gotta

if shes coming here i gotta and theres
my cattle and my land ill have to let
em go ill lose money bill see tell
you what now spose you ride over there
and tell her ive changed my mind and i
wouldnt marry her on a bet that
oughta fix her

  it oughta fix me too i says what
ole might miss with his winchester that
dog wont overlook and theres susy
herself if shed ever lay a finger on me in
anger just once ill gamble id lose a years
growth youre sort o light in the heft
andy but she shook you that time like
you was even lighter nawsir andy old
settler going over and breaking the bad
news to susy and her parent aint my idea
of a pastime

  and thats that as the man says andy
sags off slack and listless a-sucking his
lower lip mighty gloomersome

  in the evening come supper the boys was
all talking about furniture and courtship
was sofys stronger than chairs would a
chair stand a overload should a gent hold
a lady on his left knee or his right or both
thompson says that all depends on the
lady and andy lays down his knife and fork

  tom says andy cold as a froze steer
did rileys kid say anything about me
i didnt say so answers back thomp-
son but you can put down a bet ole
svenson has been saying something about
you to rileys kid

  i dunno how andy crossed the table
but hes on top of thompson anyways
quicker than he jumped johnny thomp-
son had the luck to juke andys first swing
and andys knuckles skimmed past and
nudged sam bleeker square on the kisser
so its two to one with andy taking the
short end and using everything from his
feet to the crockery

  of course the folks most concerned be-
ing hurried thalaway hadnt time to aim
careful and when the sugar-bowl shaved
my ear i went outside i think there was
four of us tried to get out the door simul-
taneous but i know i was winner

  lookit screeches simmsy combing
condensed milk out of his whiskers
lookit

  youve guessed it theres susy and
ole in a buckboard shes a week ahead of
time

  wheres andy at she wants to know

  i didnt need to answer that question
cause just then him and the other two pin-
wheeled out the door in a tangle for all
she was fat susy could move quick in no
time she was off the buckboard and had
thompson by the hair the riot calmed
down abrupt sam bleeker and thompson
crawled back into the bunk-house ad susy
hugged andy till his ribs cracked

  i ban come take you home mit me she
says i tank we skoll marry next veek

  lemme change my cloes begs andy
whod lost most of his shirt

  better hurry advises ole and he
snaked out that  winchester from under
the seat and laid it across his knees

  ill be right back promises andy and
he scrambles into the bunk-house imme-
diate

  i walked round the bunk-house and sure
enough he was crawling through a back
window

  bill he whispers pointing to the cot-
tonwoods lining the creek i can make it
to the creek if youll keep susy and ole
from getting suspicious they didnt fetch
the dog along so ill be safe hiding out by
the flat rock in the box-elders and by and
by you come tell me whats happened and
well figger out what i better do next

  i thought to myself he wouldnt do much
figgering but right then didnt seem the
proper time to tell him that so i went back
round the house again

  i talked fast and easy and susy didnt get


adventure

suspicious for as long as ten minutes
then she began to wonder out loud where
andys at from wondering she went to
looking at me kind of hard i stepped back
out of arm-reach she jerked the whip out
of the socket and allowed plenty decisive
shes a-going to search the bunk-house

  theres no stopping her she searched
that bunk-house searched it thorough and
when she didnt turn up andy shes wild
to hear her take on youd think shed lost
a gold watch

  and all the time ole was step-laddering
up and down in front the bunk-house
a-talking to heaven about whats hes aim-
ing to do to the skinny shoe-string thats
addled the affections of his girl susy he
didnt leave much unsaid ole didnt and
every now and then hed flick open his
breech-cover half-way and see was the car-
tridge still in the chamber also he kept
that rifle cocked

  me personal i was behind the woodpile
and only an eye peeking up now and then
the rest of the boys was engaged similar
wherever theres cover not that were
afraid of ole yunderstand but we couldnt
lock horns with him without crowding lil
susy

  susy ran down final and shooed ole into
the buckboard and drove off so i went over
to the flat rock in the box-elders where
andys a-sitting both ears on the stretch

kb what a relief he says easing up
luxurious when i told him theyd
gone but look here bill didnt
i hear susy screaming and carrying on a
while back i sure hope you didnt try to
argue with her

  no i says solemn as a coffin i
didnt try to argue with her and i wont-
not while i got my health and if you wan-
na keep yours and slay a bachelor you
fork your horse instanter and drag it full
split nemmine your broad acres and them
plump cows nemmine nothing but how
soon you can punch the breeze you hear
me whistling cowboy

  andys property thataway was the one
temptation to last it out but when hed
thought twice of susy and her survigorous
pa that half-section sort of dwindled down
and petered out and distance lent enchant-
ment to the view-and the farther away the
view was the better pleased hed be to see
it close

  after hed decided to flit he spent the rest
of the night fixing it up with the old man to
sell his land and cattle for him it was
graying to dawn when andy and me-i
was a witness-come out of the ofhce and
the first thing we ran into outside the door
was susy svenson and her pa

  which them two reptyles had outguessed
andy once more as i found out later
theyd switched back after leaving the bunk-
house cached their buckboard down the
creek a mile and laywayed for their prey
the best part of seven hours

  theres nothing to do-nothing-abso-
lutely nothing andy ball was a spent
shell a busted flush and a plugged nickel
from the second susy ballooned up from
the log shes sitting on and lolloped down
on his neck with a glad and joyful cry of-

  oh my andy

  he got his sentence in lessn five minutes
susy says theyll drive over to torpedo that
very morning and be married by judge
jackman she wasnt taking any more
chances so she wasnt

  poor andy he didnt have no spirit
left he agreed to everything she said
without a peep he was so discouraged
and downhearted i cinched up and rode
over with em to torpedo just to be sort o
friend-at-the-deathbed-to-the-last like

  at torpedo theres a hitch judge
jackman who issued marriage licenses as
a side line was out of town hes coming
back on no  so susy herded andy down
to the railroad station to wait for no 
ole started to take in the saloons immedi-
ate but i trailed along with andy and his
keeper

  lordy lordy i dont believe susy
hobbled her tongue once them three hours
she got andys future mapped out fourteen
years in advance by the time no  rolled in

  the first citizen off was judge jackman
the second was a two-by-tamarack runt
of a squarehead with pop-eyes a cowhide
bag and a tin trunk he was so short hed
have to climb up to sit down and he stood
there a-mopping his flat face and blinking
in the sunlight

  axel axel squealed susy stamped-
ing down on him

  mein susy mein susy cried the
squarehead fending her off with the tin
trunk and giving her just one quick-action
kiss i ban glad for find you susy i

shed forgot andy complete and effectual

dont know what that is either asked

one of question well its painting the

 hasty day was a wonder at handling
recruits his words were as sharp as
knives but they pared away only the outer
crust and left the heart unhurt in-
stinctively saltsman knew that here was a
man who would tell him just what he
wanted to know about this new strange
business and with his scathing tongue
would put him right when he went wrong

  the alta was on her maiden voyage with
a cargo of barreled oil for an english port
her skipper first lieutenant and navigator
were merchant seamen serving in the naval
reserve and in addition to this deck force
she had two ensigns from the pelham bay
school her crew made up of the different
required branches had been sent aboard
her from a training station only three days
before she sailed most of them were
young and enthusiastically eager in their
new job but depressingly green as far as
knowledge of it went

  the first week out as if to haze the can-
didates there swept down across the
grand banks the best half of a northwest
gale raking the deep laden ship with great
green seas that slapped over the battened
hatches and whirled and raced up the gang-
ways to plunge in foaming cataracts over
the wallowing sides the alia groaned
and pitched and rolled as if she too new
to the job were taking a beginners lesson

  the crew having lost interest in the
palatable concoctions of tony ravellotti
the cook stood unsteadily on the boat-
deck or lay in their bunks near convenient
deck buckets the officers and old-timers
stood the watches

shorthand-carrying half a turn left wheel
guess who i relieved hasty old salty
the farm-hand wonder had the wheel
gripped like the handles of a plow but
hanging on and keeping near enough on
the course to get by

   hello old salty i says to him
hows tricks he just grins at me and
points to the course chalked up there on
the weather board

   where you going i asks him but he
didnt answer having other business at the
lee rail pretty soon he comes staggering
back

   ive had em from green apples and
from too much watermelon and going in
swimming after i et but this here is kinder
different he confided to me does a man
ever get over it

   sure i told him all you have to
do is to catch a dolphin get tony to fry
the liver with some onions and eat that
then youll be all set

  he thanked me and went after a fish-
line can you beat it

  thatll be enough talking you two
said ben hoskins the watch officer coming
out of the chart-room where he had been
figuring a time-sight

bi wonder sometimes said the
captain joining a discussion at the
mess table why some of these
boys from inland parts of the country quit
the job they know and take up the sea
the three days storm had blown itself
out and the recruits had settled back into
a more normal routine

  i can tell you why one of them came
sir said bert hardin looking solemnly
across the table at matthew cates the
other pelham bay ensign his name is
orion and being named for a star he wants
to study navigation

  hed better begin lower down than the
stars said the captain

  he is said clinton nacke the first
lieutenant the bunch is breaking him
in on swab combs and writing letters to be
left in mail buoys and have had him up at
night holding a light at the gangway to see
if he could catch a flying fish with the
ship already in forty north and getting in a
higher latitude every watch theyve tried
every stunt on him that any of the gang
knows and so far he hasnt failed to fall
for a one of them i expect to find him
on the masthead any time keeping a look-
out for sea-serpents

  so active were his shipmates in salts-
mans education that there came a time
when they had to let up on him not because
he had ceased to take their pranks with
patient fortitude but because they had
tried out all they knew on him and could
think of few new ones

  old saltys getting wised up confided

bob woten he only grinned when
somebody tried to send him to the pay
clerk for the key to the keelson id
already sent him after it once and that
was enough

  hasty day found saltsman leading
the deck force in the amount of work done
in scraping decks washing paint-work or
polishing brass he did it all thoroughly
in his speech he mixed the idioms of land
and sea to the constant merriment of his
shipmates

  the new bowditch which he pored over
in his spare time became thumb-marked
and torn with much handling and the two
ensigns found him often in their watch
below at the door of their rooms with
questions

  now this declination he would ask
i dont rightly understand how the old
sun plows as crooked a furrow as the book
appears to make it and whats these little
crowfeet here on the chart

  in england he bought a second-hand
sextant and i learned painfully to take
observations and read the vernier and to
keep his thick sweaty fingers off the already
stained arc

the alta discharged her cargo
of oil and took on general mer-
chandise between decks and enough
manganese ore in her lower holds for ballast
the raw cold of the north atlantic was
trying on the recruits before leaving
the last english port a good many of them
had severe colds the hospital apprentice
reported on the third day that he had put
two men in their bunks

  it might develop into influenza said
the captain watch them closely

  the next day the number of sick was
increased to nine-all afflicted with high
temperature aching joints and all the
symptoms of the epidemic

  its the flu all right sir the hospital
apprentice told the captain id like to
have a nurse somebody to help me take
care of them

  take who you want the captain
ordered keep them isolated in one
compartment keep the place scrubbed
and clean

  the hospital apprentice asked for a
volunteer at the mess table that evening

  ill have to have a little sleep he said
i want somebody to go on at night and

relieve me all you have to do is to give
the medicine and keep the worst ones
covered up and in their bunks

  the men looked at one another without
answering there had been stories of
ships found drifting helplessly with all
the crew sick or dead the disease was
known to be extremely contagious and
no one was anxious to expose himself
there had come to them letters from their
shipmates in receiving stations telling of
the awful toll of sudden death

  all right said the hospital apprentice
ill just pick put one of you and have the
captain issue an order

  i didnt come here to wait on the sick
grumbled one of the men

  you just take my job and let me do it
then said hasty day turning on the
speaker with withering scorn all some
of you fellows know about the sea is sight-
seeing and drawing your pay

  do you reckon i could do it asked
saltsman meekly from the end of the table

  sure let old salty do it came a chorus
hes germ-proof if they got on him
theyd laugh themselves to death
youre it then big fellow said hasty
day if you mean it but if you want
to back out ill give one of these would-be
comedians a chance most of them never
got by that place in their lives where they
first learned to let old george do the mean
jobs

  id try it said saltsman neighbors
had to wait on the sick a little back home
itd give me more time for my figgering too
maybe

  unanimously elected said hasty day
glaring about -him

  and so it was decided

  in the days that followed the volunteer
nurse had small chance to look into his
navigation books his patients demanded
all of his strength and every moment of
his time patiently he soothed their fever
with icy wet cloths washed their faces
and brought them food and drink in
between times often to the accompaniment
of groans and the labored breathing and
muttering of men half delirious he
scrubbed and cleaned continuously

  he and the hospital apprentice relieved
each other in turns of eight hours each
night and day while the crew stood aloof
shunning witii awe the affected compart-
ment more men caught the epidemic


adventure

until fifteen were down and one night
while saltsman watched a man died
despite the stimulating hypodermic which
the hospital apprentice had taught him to
use

  the crew grew panicky fear ridden
suspicious of every cough and sneeze and
went hurriedly away when saltsman or the
hospital apprentice appeared

  saltsman grew pale and hollow-eyed
but kept cheerful with strength which
seemed endless hasty day one of the
few who refused to be in any way affected
asked him about a relief

  i guess id better keep on said salts-
man these others aint had no fair
chance to learn and there might be some
like little bobbie white that i could keep
from going even if i did fail with him

  seems as if youd be afraid of getting it
yourself sticking so long said hasty

  i never had nothing in my life said the
other solemnly

  all right old salty go right to it
said the boatswains mate you and
pills are doing fine but theres no need
to row a good boat on the rocks either

  gradually the epidemic began to release
its grip on the ship those who were
seriously ill passed the crisis and the fighter
cases became convalescent as if its pres-
ence aboard had innoculated the rest of the
crew with an antitoxin no more cases
appeared

  with his charges giving less trouble
saltsman took up his navigation again
he had an old pilot chart of the north
atlantic and put down each day with a
pencil a ringed dot to mark the position
he found the chart was worn and showed
many erasures and saltsmans marks
where he had laboriously sought to make
his own calculations come somewhere near
the correct noon positions bore a striking
resemblance to the irregular outline of a
range of mountains still he was making
progress and his faithfulness with the sick
made the officers more lenient toward his
many questions

       the alta bound for the gulf ports
came to the straits between florida
and the bahama islands at dusk
one night she passed jupiter light salts-
man had the chart spread out on an empty
bunk and crouched beside it on his knees
a penciled cross marked the position of the

ship while he measured from the margin
the distance off shore so engrossed was
he that ben hoskins the watch officer
had to call twice rather loudly before
saltsman got up and came to the door of the
compartment his stub of a pencil still
clutched in his fingers

  give me a shot of something for my
head will you demanded the officer
make it pretty strong too

  yes sir said saltsman and unlocked
the little woven-wire clothes locker that
he and the hospital apprentice had taken
for a medicine chest

  has the doctor given you anything yet
asked saltsman

  no whats that got to do with it
shake a leg and lets have something im
on watch

  the navigator was cross and irritable
he was unused to sickness of any kind
his temples throbbed and a burning cord
seemed to draw at the back of his head
he felt feverish and his throat was parched
and dry saltsman rolled out from a bottle
labeled aspirin a couple of white pellets
and drew off a glass of water

  this heres for the headache sir he
said let em go down whole it gen-
erally takes two doses if the headaches bad
ill bring the other up to the bridge when
its time for it

  the officer swallowed the medicine and
saltsman watched him walk rather un-
steadily to the boat-deck ladder and
climb up

  he acts like hes got it too he said
to himself and started back to the chart
room pausing to close the medicine chest
by golly he said as he eyed the row of
bottles doc always gives salts too and
i forgot it

  pouring out a liberal dose into the glass
hoskins had used he dissolved it in water
heated over a little alcohol lamp then
making a round of the patients and seeing
them all quiet he followed the officer to the
bridge

  the night was dark and heavily overcast
the wind which had been blowing from al-
most dead ahead was now abeam coming
from the lighted compartment to the
darkened bridge saltsman could not see
very well at first only the quartermaster
at die wheel and the dark blur of a bundled
up signal-boy pacing back and forth were
in sight
the makings of a sailorman



  wheres mr hoskins asked saltsman
in low tones going over and looking into
the binnacle past the helmsmans shoulder

  back to the chart - room i guess
whatre you doing salty helping him
navigate

  saltsman grinned being kidded about
studying navigation had never worried him

  i brought him some medicine he
said

  well youd better give it to him said
the other hes peevish enough to heave
you over the side if he catches you chewing
the fat with the man at the wheel beat
it now before youre caught

  saltsman could not resist another look
at the compass despite the others warning

  saltsman noted that the course was two
hundred and seventy degrees he repeated
the figures over to himself to keep from
forgetting them as he went toward the
chart-room

  the side door was open and at its
entrance he called softly getting no
answer he went on in at once he caught
the sound of heavy labored breathing
and in a moment he was kneeling over the
officers body lying full length on the deck
saltsman took hold of his shoulder and
shook him hoskins groaned threshed
up with his arms and sent the glass which
saltsman held spinning across the deck

  the motion was one of delirium and
from his nursing the sailor recognized it
even in the dark he put his hand on the
officers forehead and then down inside his
shirt the man seemed afire with the fever
that racked him saltsman wondered what
to do next in the back of his consciousness
he was still repeating the course he had read
from the compass and suddenly he realized
it was wrong he had just left half an
hours painful study of his chart and re-
membered that the true course was almost
south

  two hundred and seventy degrees
he said ought to be one hundred and
seventy or near-abouts

  he shook hoskins again and tried to
rouse him then he thought of the night
order book the purpose of which he had
tried so faithfully to memorize leaving
hoskins he switched on the light over the
broad desk where the charts were spread
and found the course written in ink as
plainly as could be-signed with the cap-
tains initials-one hundred and seventy

degrees the chart was there also to
show plainly that the course should be
almost due south instead of west

  by tlie light saltsman saw too that
hoskins face was flushed his mouth open
and his hands gripping convulsively his
unseeing eyes stared straight up at the deck
overhead

  bad off said saltsman mustve
fell in a faint like tilman did id better
call doc

  shoving aside the chart and navigation
books he lifted the heavy man to the desk
and put an oilskin coat under his head
then he ran out on the bridge again to see
if by any chance he had been mistaken in
the reading of the compass

  whats all the excitement asked the
quartermaster who had heard the breaking
glass did he throw the stuff at you
mr hoskins is bad sick im going
after doc but youre steering the wrong
course it ought to be one hundred and
seventy not two hundred and seventy
mustve had a shot too many of your
own dope said the quartermaster calmly
fooling with the wild ones in the sick
bay must be catching go see about mr
hoskins and turn off that light you left
burning in the chart-room

  the course is wrong i tell you in-
sisted saltsman and its narrow along
here change it right away before i go
change nothing you big boob what
do you think i am taking orders from a
baby whale changing the course without
proper orders is apt to put a man in jail
for the rest of his life if hes unlucky enough
to still have it when the ship hits the
beach

  but its there in the book said salts-
man growing more excited all the time
i saw it hurry so i can go on and do
something for mr hoskins

  i go by my orders bo said the other
firmly brush on by now if youre
so sure of yourself wake up the old man
and tell him your troubles but dont tell
em to me

  get away from there said the big
sailor with sudden determination youre
heading wrong certain and sure

  he took hold of the wheel struggling for
its possession

  micky morton the quartermaster was
one of the old-timers squarely built and
stocky he tried to hold the wheel and


adventure

with elbows and back to shake saltsman
off but despite all he could do it went over
spoke by spoke and very slowly the big
ship began to swing around

  let go said micky wrathfully and
stepped back swinging a straight blow for
saltsmans face

  the quartermasters aim was good and
there was no attempt to parry it would
have been a knockout for most any one
else but saltsman only grunted shook his
head and swept back with one of his big
hands holding the wheel over with the other
the move was unexpected as the quarter-
master had good reason to believe that his
blow would put the man out and in the
dark he did not see it coming he was sent
spinning across the bridge

  you leave me be said saltsman with-
out anger i know what im about
same as all the other nuts from the nut
farms retorted the quartermaster his head
ringing with the mighty cuff

  he collided with the nest of speaking-
tubes that went below and jerked out one
of the plugs to whistle for the captain

  ill have the old man up come on
over here bert he called to the signal-boy
gimme me a hand with this loco hay
pitcher cant wait for an answer but the
whistle will bring him

  bert was reluctant

  maybe mr hoskins did say one hun-
dred and seventy and not two hundred and
seventy he temporized lets wait for
the skipper

  wait nothing this birds gone wild
hell pile us up on the beach while the
old man is getting his boots on grab
him around the legs while i sink another
hot one in his jaw

  you two let me alone begged salts-
man i dont want to hurt neither one
of you but im a-going to hold this here
wheel till she reads a hundred and seventy
the two men advanced using con-
siderable caution the alta was swinging
sluggishly with left wheel

light ho exclaimed the sig-
nalman suddenly

  where away answered the
quartermaster mechanically wondering
what other complication was developing
to confuse a situation still far from solution

  red light half a point on the starboard
bow cried the signalman pointing

  schooner or something said the quar-
termaster no masthead light were
right on top of her and shes got all the
right of way there ever was suffering pete
what a smash-up pull that whistle cord
bert three blasts

  the quartermaster jumped for the en-
gine-room telegraph intending to back the
engines

  saltsman was the quicker he had seen
the light too and picking up the grating
which smaller helmsmen used to stand on
he jammed it under the wheel to hold it
where he wanted and ran to the telegraph
micky felt himself picked up bodily his
hand torn from the lever as he was
thrown down the deck he heard saltsmans
grunt of effort the pointer still stood
at full speed ahead

  bert the signal-boy had reached the
wheel pulled out the grating and started
to revolve the spokes to stop the altas turn

  keep away buddie warned saltsman
im going to do the steering till the captain
gets here

  at his command the signal-boy let go
promptly even with the quartermasters
help he was doubtful of success in subduing
the big sailor

  saltsman took the wheel the red light
was now broad on the starboard lxw

  thatll clear now he muttered and
spun the wheel over reversed the helm and
began to steady the big ship

  green to green and red to red he
muttered to himself keep your course and
go ahead

  the quartermaster scrambling back from
the wing of the bridge where saltsmans
heave and a roll of the ship at the same
time had thrown him came up behind again

  dont you know anything you big
farmer he shouted youve got your
green light to the other fellows red one
put her over right wheel quick before we
cut her in two

  again he attempted to reach the spokes
but as before saltsman shook him off
micky mortons morale was still good
but the feel of the big sailors enormous
strength had made him wary

  youre trying to fool me said salts-
man i dont trust you red to red the
book says and i learnt it by heart shes
passing anyhow whatever it is

  yes i see said the quartermaster
scornfully all the real sailors are not
the makings of a sailorman



dead yet the skipper of the other craft
must have put her about seeing that who-
ever was at the wheel here meant to run
him down rules or no rules give me that
wheel now you bone-headed pumpkin
peeler and quit this monkey business
come on bert weve got to manhandle
this guy

  the two made another determined but
unsuccessful attempt to wrest the wheel
from saltsman the fight was interrupted
in its first stages by the voice of the captain
coming up from below seeing first the light
on the bow and then the struggling men
at the wheel

  whats going on here where is the
officer of the watch whats that light on
the bow

  quickly he swung his night glasses into
position and gave a sharp quick order-
left wheel

  micky and bert fell back at once and
saltsman obeyed the order promptly the
red light came on the beam on the quarter
and then showed up astern

  ease your helm ordered the captain
steady at eighty for the present now
tell me what happened

  things were all right sir answered
the quartermaster running along as
smooth as could be until this fellow came
running up here saying we were off the
course and taking the wheel away from me
he said mr hoskins was sick in the chart-
room and we ought to be steering one hun-
dred and seventy instead of two hundred
and seventy

  the course is one hundred and seventy
the captain broke in sharply its in the
night order book that red light is on a
gas buoy at the end of barrier shoals its
a good thing somebody changed the course
whats the reason i wasnt called sooner
i did call you sir as soon as i could get
to the tube but mr hoskins told me
plainly that it was two hundred and
seventy then he went to the chart-room
and didnt come back

  never mind about that its easy to
confuse one and two with no one here to
check up get aft on the run and take a
sounding and you signal-boy jump be-
low and break out the doctor where is
mr hoskins

  hes in the chart-room sir said salts-
man lying on the table

  then still holding the wheel saltsman
told his part of the story in halting em-
barrassed sentences

  you thought the red light was a ship
did you

  yes sir said saltsman the quar-
termaster said it was a sailing vessel of
some kind because she didnt carry a mast-
head light and i made a big mistake sir
being worried and upset with so many
things on my mind i was thinking our
red light was next to that red light and
kept her going straight if it had been a
sliip we would have run together but
captain the boys was pestering me a lot and
pulling at me i just naturally forgot
its a blessing you did said the skipper
and i hardly believe you will ever forget
that little point again this time if you
had read the fights correctly we should
have run straight in across barrier shoals
instead of outside in deep water taking
charge as you did saved the ship im
going to see that you get a better chance
to study navigation youve got the
makings of a real sailorman in you

  this from the captain meant a great deal
and saltsman knew it he had been
anxious about the outcome of what he had
done and here was praise heaped upon
him he stood seeking words to express
his gratitude but before he could speak the
captain went on

  here come the others he said get
on below now and see if you can help with
mr hoskins

  ben hoskins was revived with a whiff
of ammonia and carried to his room the
moderate dose of aspirin given for the head-
ache had been sufficient to slow up his
heart and make him faint but left no bad
after effects with the usual few days of
fever he began to get well during his
convalescence he laid out a course of study
for saltsman which had the captains
approval he was quite as grateful as
the captain for what the boy had done for
had the alta gone on the reef he would have
been responsible as it was his watch

  ill have you ready to take out a license
as soon as you get your discharge he
promised saltsman and kept his word

of the north

  four-part story

       part m
       hugh penclexter

author of red bells when kentucky starved etc

the first part of the story briefly retold in story form

tlack chabot manager of the pembina post
of the north west company was as fond of
high wine-alcohol diluted with water-as were the
indians with whom he traded he was more lavish
with the new milk than were the other posts and
consequently his chippewas were usually drunk
gradually his power was waning for the indians had
little respect for the white man who got drunk with
them as his clerk i was the only one at the post
who still held their respect for i never drank
even old tabashaw their chief seldom disobeyed
me

  it was april in the first year of black chabots
management  new skins were coming in and
the indians were in an ugly drunken mood i
realized that they were bent on making trouble

  we will kill the white men and take their new
milk for ourselves

  it was old tabashaw the chippewa chief who had
spoken and i knew the threat was not an idle one

  the sioux the sioux are upon us

  black chabot brought this news there was
nothing that could sober the chippewas so quickly
as this alarm and only their preparations to defend
themselves saved the white men at the post

  flat mouth one of the chippewas was the only
one i felt i could trust and so i dispatched him to
learn if the sioux were really upon us when he
returned it was with the news that the smoke which
had caused the alarm had been made by friendly
crees and assiniboins bringing trade the danger
was past but the rumor had served its turn the
chippewas were quiet

  the next day i was dispatched to the x y a
rival post to make an agreement against sending
men out to drum up trade at the n w posts on
the reed and on the scratching i stoppped to order
the managers to be prepared to send their skins
down the river i knew that the brigade would
start soon and was happy for back at headquarters
i had determined to ask for transfer-anything
to get away from black chabot

  both desset and probos the managers of these
two posts aroused my suspicions they seemed to
be madly hurrying to pack their skins but the
brigade seldom left till june and it was now only

april desset claimed that his books had been
burned by a drunken indian and all his accounts
destroyed he seemed too to have very few skins
yet the season had been a good one then from one
of dessets men i learned that the manager had
been sending skins down the river secretly desset
had secured his post through black chabot so i sus-
pected that all of the managers were involved in a
plot to cheat the north west company

  at the x y i reached an agreement with red
dearness the rival manager there too i tried to
solve the mystery of red dearness woman reported
by some to be a half-breed i heard her speak and
knew from her talk that she was educated but i did
not see her

  the next morning at the scratching pest i was
dumbfounded to see black chabot and the brigade
coming down the river their canoes loaded with
skins why had they started so early it was then
that the blow fell black chabot ordered me to
stay at the pembina post and take charge during
the summer i was not to go back to the country
of the whites where i had not been in three years
the disappointment was great but i mastered it
and started back to the post while chabot and des-
set set off on my way i saw that red dearness
too was going down the river with his skins

  another sioux scare sent flat mouth and myself
south of the pembina to investigate a detach-
ment of warriors was encountered and flat mouth
brought back four scalps

  at the post some crees and assiniboins came in
but they refused to hunt i finally found the reason
their medicine had been stolen the voice from
riviere quappelle the river tha caus had dis-
appeared this river a man fork j the assini-
boin was regarded with much fear by the indians of
the northwest it was supposed to be haunted by a
mi ity spirit which cried aloud in its flight up and
down the course such a voice had been heard on
the pembina recently and the crees believed it had
been stolen by the chippewas

  accustomed to indian superstition i realized
what disastrous results this would have on the
morale of my hunters i promised that the voice
should be restored in month


gentlemen of the north

the next day i received a call from red dear-
ness woman and to my surprize discov-
ered that this woman was the traders daughter
and not a half-breed wife as had been rumored
her fiery red hair had caused the indians to give
her the name medicine hair and credit her with
supernatural powers

  her call was a matter of business she urged me
to stop trading rum with the indians and to my
amusement told me she had already discontinued
the practise

  she also revealed to me the mystery of the voice
in her visit to the pembina she had often sung along
that lonely river and the indians hearing this had
believed her voice to be that of the river that
calls

  before leaving she threatened to use her power
over the superstitious indians to force them to trade
skins without rum i laughed at her well knowing
the power of high wine

  as the days passed however my trade fell oil
alarmingly

  crazy for rum one of the x y indians stole a
keg from the n w i started out after him and
my quest finally brought me to miss dearness she
forced the indian to return the keg and so quickly
did he do her bidding that i then realized how great
was her power over the savages

  god but youre a tearing beauty said a
thick voice

  miss dearness and i turned to find that black
chabot had returned-drunk as usual he leered
at the woman and informed her that he had over-
taken the x y brigade down the river and that her
father had died during the trip

  as he reached at miss dearness i knocked him
down



  the fight was one-sided for black chabot was
very drunk i finally drove him down the river
swearing that if he ever returned i would kill
him

  a few days later i learned that miss dearness
had gone up the river in search of skins to my
surprize too i learned that she had played upon
the superstitions of flat mouth to force him to ac-
company her

  realizing the danger she ran in the sioux coun-
try i finally resolved to follow packing some
white buffalo robes which are considered big medi-
cine by all tribes except the chippcwas i set out
alone leaving probos in charge

  on the way my worst fears were confirmed i
encountered a hostile sioux scout fearing lest i
was already too late i hastened on up tfie red
lake river

  there i found more signs of the enemy then
suddenly the undergrowth parted and i caught a
glimpse of disheveled red hair

  the friendly pillager flat mouth was close be-
hind the three of us united and made our way to
the river and crossed only to find a dozen of the
enemy awaiting us

  here however the white robes i had brought
came into use miss dearness wrapped one around
both flat mouth and myself the sioux seeing
the powerful medicine hesitated and we succeeded
in gaining shelter in the woods

  there surrounded by the sioux we decided to
wait until night i trusted to my double-barreled
gun and their fear of the medicine robes to keep the
indians off till darkness could aid our escape but
there was only one chance in a thousand that we
could win free and back-track safely through the
long reaches of that wild country

chapter vii

 the sioux receive reinforcements

 this encouraged us tremendously
miss dearness stuck more willow
branches around our two forts
while i remained with the
chief who was curiously watching the
indians on the plains all of the sioux
were now mounted the horses the pil-
lager had captured being replaced by those
whose owners had fallen for some minutes
the band milled about then one man
rode aside and began haranguing in a
loud voice the pillager who had traveled
and lived on the missouri readily inter-
preted the speech which consisted of ex-
hortations for the sioux to remember they
were brave men that our scalps must go
back to their village to wipe out their dis-
grace in having lost warriors the white
woman was to be taken alive i was glad
miss dearness was busy with her willow
wands for the pillager interpreted word for

word and she understood the chippewa
tongue almost as well as she did english

 when the speechmaker desisted the
sioux swung into a long line a maneuver
beautifully executed in this formation
they came towards us at a walk tossing
up their lances waving their axes and sing-
ing lustily i made ready with my gun
picking the leader and a man on the left
end as my two victims but flat mouth
folded his arms and did not even see to it
that his bow was taut

  make ready i nervously advised

  he grunted in disgust all but half a
dozen of the horsemen began to pivot
on the left end of their line and almost
before i could understand what they were
up to this huge segment was galloping
madly along parallel to the woods and
away from us

  when night comes we shall ride very
swift or very soft mumbled flat mouth
resuming the task of gathering arrows

  in short the sioux were perfectly willing
we should break from cover and ride south


adventure

  and left the six men to keep watch on us
but if we attempted to ride north we must
pass through the bulk of their band

  miss dearness came up to us and i told
her how the sioux had thrown most of their
men to the other side of the grove she
promptly said

  it doesnt make sense if they didnt
dare attack when all together what good
will it do them to divide their forces
they will wait until dusk and creep in

from both sides-

  and be shooting into each other she
shot in

  or stayout on the plain and wait for us
to try and break through i concluded

  but if they dont dare attack in force
they must know we can stay here as long
as they can stay out there we can creep
to the river and fish we can make some
kind of a raft and cross or float down-
stream we can stay right here and eat
our horses the rivulet furnishes water
and there is a chance that some of our
chippewas may come up the river and give
them battle theres more to it than a
waiting campaign theyre anxious to
cage us up here until what whatever it is
the time will be short

  she spoke in english and i translated
it to the pillager his small eyes sparkled
appreciatively and he declared

  medicine hair sees beyond the woods
and hill she can call and send away a
voice she can send her eyes far up the
river and over the plain look tell me
what that means

  he was pointing to the south and at first
i could make out nothing then i spied it
a thin stream of blue smoke the girl
promptly said in chippewa

  the sioux know help is coming they
will not attack until their friends come
that will be some time before morning
soon the others will send up a smoke
the meaning of the smoke was very
obvious not a half-breed hunter not a
man at any post in our department who
could not have read it even probos
would have understood yet the pillager
a master at such things heard her as if she
had been an oracle

  can the medicine hairs eyes when
she calls them back tell how many sioux
there are at the bottom of that smoke
he humbly asked

  as many as were here before you killed

  any she calmly replied then in english
to me its reasonable to believe they
belong to the same party and split up in
two equal bands so long as he believes in
my manito so much the braver will he be
the chief began talking to himself in a
guttural and almost audible voice and
fell to fingering his bow nervously his
emotion was occasioned by the sight of the
six warriors out in front they were
beyond arrow range and only by luck could
a ball score any damage

  they began running back and forth
and we saw they were heaping up dry grass
they paid no attention to us being intent
solely on answering the signal

  with a leap the pillager was on his horse
and riding towards them his bow held with
arrow notched he was not singing now
and as if in a trance the girl and i watched
his progress as the drama of the situation
got into our heads we instinctively clasped
hands back and forth scuttled the sioux
forward rode the pillager then one of
them chanced to discover him and with
a shout of fear turned and made for his
pony i saw him go down with a sioux
arrow buried to the feathers in his back

  with screams of rage the others snatched
up their weapons opened fire and then
mounted their horses with a whoop the
pillager charged at them and they sep-
arated in haste to let him pass through
but when a bit beyond the fallen warrior
he brought his pony round on two hoofs
and was making for the timber swinging
very low from the saddle as he rode for
a moment the speed of his mount was
checked then picked up a rattling pace
and the chief was sitting erect waved some-
thing round his head and sounded his ter-
rible scalp-cry

  by heavens but that was a coup
worth counting i fiercely exclaimed

with a little shudder the girl reminded
they could have come through the
woods while we stood here weve been

very careless and-

  she ceased abruptly and stared down at
our clasped hands

  i was as much surprized as she cer-
tainly i was no more conscious than she
of having taken her hand it was three
years since i had taken a white womans
hand in no way was the experience dis-
pleasing

  he may need help she said releasing
gentlemen of the north



her hand and looking toward the pillager

  i leaped out in front with my gun and
the warriors behind the chippewa vanished
over the sides of their ponies and swung off
to the west on rushed flat mouth still
singing and shouting but the climax of
his arrival was weakened by a puff of smoke
from a mound of grass the signal fire
was burning and the indians were heaping
wet grass and green branches upon it

  leaving the two to watch the smoke
i hastened to the north side of the grove
had the enemy but known it he could
have massacred the girl and me easily as
we watched the pillagers sensational ex-
ploit when i came to the end of the
growth i noted the sioux had heard the
chippewas scalp-yell and were very un-
easy they were riding back and forth
their eyes fixed on the timber while one of
their number was galloping madly toward
the tip of the grove to learn what had
happened after watching them for a
minute and failing to detect any sign of
an advance on our position i returned to
my companions and related what i had
observed

  the name of eshkebugecoshe fills the
sioux hearts with fear it makes them
old women loudly boasted the chief

  it was a big coup i declared you
may paint the marks of death and the
feet of horses on your body and on your
tent to show you killed a man while riding
hard

the chief toned down his vanity on
meeting the girls clear gaze and confessed

  eshkebugecoshe is a mighty warrior
but the white womans medicine helped
him it made the sioux blind till i could
creep very close

  couldnt we get across the river i
can swim eagerly spoke up miss dear-
ness

      flat mouth said it would be
y foolish to cross before dark but
he suggested that i reconnoiter
the river while he watched the indians
he did not seem to think much of the
suggestion but as it came from the girl
he was bound to consider it probably
believing her medicine suggested the
plan i thought very favorably of the
idea the indians belief that we planned
to use the ponies in attempting to escape
would tend to blunt their watch of the river

  i followed the rivulet until i came to
its mouth a bit of a beach grown round
with reeds and tall grass the river rolled
brown and silent except for the murmuring
of air currents mid-stream a huge tree
floated with roots upraised like arms held
up in surrender-desolation and solitude
as i watched the water i decided a man
could well risk the danger a long swim
under water timed to take advantage of
some of the driftwood ever passing and
the trick could be turned but the water
was icy cold and the danger was not for a
woman to run unless absolutely necessary

  yet at night with the aid of a log miss
dearness could be ferried across i began
to look about for some fallen timber which
would serve as a raft it was while occu-
pied in this task that i received ample
proof that the sioux had not forgotten the
river the proof was an arrow which
whizzed by my head and disappeared in
the reeds i drew back among the trees
and cocking my gun searched the top of
the bank i could see nothing suspicious
yet a savage could remain below the bank
with the top of his head masked by the
fringe of dead grass thus concealed he
could follow my every movement and loose
another arrow when i presented a fair
target

  the thought made me uncomfortable
and i retreated deeper into the grove a
mocking yell told me that my flight had
been witnessed and incensed i turned
back determined to get a shot at him
the rascal was too cunning in his hiding
so returning to my companions i reported
the incident

  flat mouth slipped out of his white
robes and without a word stole to the
river to match his woodcraft against the
sentinels as he had reported that the
sioux on the north side of the timber were
quiet and as no danger could take the
girl unaware from the south side i sur-
rendered to my desire and followed him

  armed only with his bow and arrow
he slipped through the growth with the
softness of a lynx following my trail along
the rivulet keeping well back i watched
him he was studying my tracks rather
than looking about for the enemy he
halted a short distance from where i had
stood in the open when the arrow missed
me then glided to the edge of the reeds
and bending low pulled an arrow from the


adventure

muck as he straightened i saw his arm
twitch and a red blotch appear on the
biceps leaping to one side he fitted the
arrow to his bow gave a keen sweeping
glance overhead and discharged the arrow
almost with the twang of the bow there
came the shrill death-cry from the sentinel
and i saw a dark body bump down along
the trunk of an oak and lodge against one
of its branches

  gliding back to me the pillager an-
nounced

  sometime i will climb up and get his
hair the arrow in the mud showed that
it came from overhead and not from the
bank

  with this explanation he registered the
kill with his terrible war-cry

  we hastened back through the grove
the pillager swinging to the north to recon-
noiter while i made direct for miss dear-
ness she had heard the two cries one of
death and one of victory and stood facing
the river her hands twisted together her
face white and drawn on beholding me
she hastily turned toward the plain and
her hands fell listlessly to her side

  the column of smoke had replied to the
message from the south and was now
dying out she informed that while i had
been gone the indians had used their robes
to coafine the smoke and then released it
in puffs had the pillager witnessed it he
could have read the code however it
was not difficult to guess the message it
told those in the south to hasten if they
would be in at a triple kill

  until now i had had no chance to ex-
change more than a few words with miss
dearness she gestured for me to sit beside
her on the robes and i took the oppor-
tunity to say

  you should have started back east the
minute you heard your father was dead

  i told him i would stay till some one
came to take his place

  but its no place for a white woman
i protested its bad enough for a man
to be cast away among these savages

  she smiled faintly and reminded-

  the only danger ive faced-until to-
day-was from a white man black
chabot

  i wish the robe had hit him with his
arrows

  i told the robe to be very careful and
not hit him the drunken beast

  if we could only get word to my chip-
pewas i sighed

  it would do no good so long as i am
with you she discouraged then with
a grim little laugh im bad luck if you
were alone they would come but not while
im with you they believe i stole the
voice from the qu appelle or that my
medicine wasnt strong enough to keep it
if i hadnt sent the voice back they would
dare anything to help me

  then the crees and assiniboins

  theyve heard the chippewas tell that
my medicine is weak now they believe
i would have kept the voice if i could
they feel no gratitude it would be as
dangerous for me to meet cree or assiniboin
away from the post as it has been to meet
the sioux

  nonsense i scoffed theyre afraid
of you even if they dont like your medi-
cine

  they hate me and they dont fear me
when i went on the river alone at night
and sang to forget my loneliness i little
knew what i was stirring up i went to
get away from the drinking and fighting
i sang as i was always singing back in the
east

  but the assiniboins would listen to me
i proudly insisted

  mr franklin you dont know them
youve met those that come to your post
their territory extends far to the west
theyre a mighty people youve met
men from one band only meet them
away from your fort and your rum and you
will find theyre very much savages

a horseman suddenly darted
toward us his bow drawn seeking
to learn if we were keeping watch
i covered his bobbing figure as best i could
and held my fire until he should come with-
in decent range just as i began to hope
he pulled his pony about and scuttled back
to his mates

  who are you where were you bom
i asked lowering my gun

  english-england she murmured her
gaze wandering far beyond the wild
horizon

  and im an american flat mouth
thinks your hair is medicine

  with a little frown she gathered up the
disheveled mass and before my eyes per-
formed the miracle of restoring her hair
gentlemen of the north



to glossy smoothness by the simple process
of patting twisting and poking stay out
in the northwest for three seasons and you
will appreciate how keenly this simple task
appeals to a white man

  she faced me suddenly her blue eyes
prying deep into mine and abruptly
asked-

  why do you look at me like that
  like what i defended

  as if you had never seen a woman
before

  i havent seen a white woman for three
seasons i sighed

  i understand and she turned to
resume her watch of the indians

  a white woman even if she be as
ignorant and unattractive as a scullery
maid would seem a goddess to you now
scarcely that i demurred three
years out here is a long time but not an
eternity i never dream of scullery

maids i-

  her grave reproachful gaze caused me
to shift and ask-

  youll be willing to start back east after
you get out of this

  when my successor comes the x y
people allow nothing to interfere with the
interests of the company

  except rum i reminded

 that was my whim the company
will disapprove my defense will be that
the drinking made it dangerous for me
they will let it go at that the com-
panies know liquor is bad for the trade
if it werent for competition they wouldnt
use it it isnt sound business you must
depend entirely upon the indians to get
furs into the posts the richest fur country
in the world would be worthless unless
you had indians to work it then where
is the sense in killing off your workmen
with rum every drinking match means
so many wounded and usually one or more
dead its bad enough when the quarrels
are kept within one tribe but let a chip-
pewa stab a cree or a cree an assiniboin
and you have a season of war between the
two tribes and no trade except when
fighting an opposition the hudsons bay
company is very careful about giving out
liquor so would the x y and the n w
be if either could have all the trade

  if the n w and the opposition posts
should shut down on rum tomorrow youd
find these indians hunting for some free

trader to give rum for their goods they
will travel any distance to get new milk
they will have rum and we must have the
furs there is no other way

  oh yes there is she murmured give
one company a monopoly of the trade
and the furs will come in and no rum will
go out

 but which company the n w
then i agree with all my heart

  the companies should combine into one
no company would refuse if it knew a
monopoly was to be granted

  she became silent and i was satisfied
to study her profile during the stress
of fighting and retreating i had defended
her from a sense of duty the puzzling
and disturbing emotions which had driven
me up the river to find her had abated
from the moment we met in the woods
and i learned my work was cut out for
me she became quite impersonal some-
thing to be saved the pillager placed
her on a pedestal and looked on her as
mighty medicine because of her hair

  now that i took time to study her she
became a personality again to be pro-
tected differently than one protects a pack
of beaver this knowledge was borne in
upon me after i had decided she was very
tired weariness suggests weakness the
strain had told on her and this fact human-
ized her i began to pity her i was
guilty of feeling glad she was weary for
it proved that she was no superwoman

  i arranged a robe at the foot of an oak
between two huge roots and asked her to
lie there and rest at first she dismissed
the suggestion with an impatient shake of
the head then abruptly changed her mind
and made herself comfortable i remained
behind the bushes watching the enemy
inside of five minuted her deep and regular
breathing told me she was asleep

  i turned and looked at her and found
the masculine resolution which had char-
acterized her face was replaced by woman-
liness she held a new interest for me
and i wondered if when back east she was
not always like this relaxed and soft and
winsome she was half reclining half
sitting with her head and shoulders
against the oak and as i gazed her head
sank to one side and i feared she would
lean too far and lose her balance i sat
beside her and her head rested on my
shoulder


adventure

  thus we sat while the sun sped along on
its eternal errand thus we sat when a
sioux vidette galloped slowly toward the
grove with the intention of counting coup
by coming very close through the lace
work of willow branches i could see the
scoundrel plainly although remaining un-
seen by him

  as the girl had her head pillowed on my
right shoulder i raised my gun with my
left hand even when thus handicapped
i knew i could pot him if he should come
up a bit closer he wavered almost halted
and stabbed his suspicious glances up and
down the front of our shelter then directed
his horse well within easy range i had
him only the explosion of the piece would
have startled the girl i held my fire
something suddenly alarmed him and he
yanked his pony about and rode frantically
back to his mates arrows began pursuing
him three in the air at a time and i knew
the pillager was back from his trip of dis-
covery the arrows did no damage and
the man escaped

  then the pillager burst through the
undergrowth his face distorted with fear
on beholding us he grunted in deep disgust
yet looked much relieved finding the
savage so close without any action on my
part he assumed we had been butchered
the girl stirred and opened her blue eyes
for a few moments she remained with her
head on my shoulder her eyes slightly
dazed as sleep still lingered then a red
tide spread to her neck and she drew back
against the tree trunk

  you could have killed him flat
mouth was accusing

  the range was long i protested

  you could have killed him insisted
the chief the medicine hair slept on
your shoulder or we would have now one
more dead sioux

  the girl understood her manner was
gentle as she asked-

  you didnt fire because of me

  you were sleeping nicely you needed
rest tonight will be very hard on you
besides the chief is mistaken the war-
rior was too far away

  flat mouth easily followed my disclaimer
and with a grunt cried

  let the medicine hair see how far away
the sioux dog was

  before i could stop him he was running
out on the plain the horsemen pranced

about undecided whether to drive him
back or await developments possibly they
believed he was insane he stopped stuck
an arrow into the earth and loudly called
here white woman is where the dog
turned his horse is it long range
almost an easy pistol-shot she mur-
mured you shouldnt have minded me
but i do mind you i assured be-
sides one more dead wont save us others
will be arriving before night shooting
wont get us clear we must depend on
the darkness

  you think we can break through she
wistfully asked

  we will sneak through i answered
renewing my pity for her as i more fully
realized how she had stood face to face
with death ever since discovered by the
sioux

  the pillager and i had the stimulus of
battle to hold us up to the mark she
must await the verdict and if it be adverse
kill herself or die a thousand deaths

  i suppose it depends on whether the
sioux up the river arrive before or after
dark she murmured

  it will be dark before they arrive
i comforted

  i was horribly afraid the sioux would
make all haste on reading the smoke which
told of three victims-one a woman-
awaiting capture i believed they would
arrive before night did they do this we
must stand an attack in force and go down
fighting i prayed for a storm to spoil
their bow-strings and leave my gun master
of the situation but the wind continued
strong from the south and there was no
hint of rain in the sky

  had it been a case of the pillager and
myself we would have taken to the river
trusting to reach the opposite bank and
find a hiding place in the thickly timbered
country by separating one of us would
stand some chance of escaping together
with the girl it would be a miracle if we
could conceal ourselves even if we reached
the other bank of the river only a black
night would reduce the advantage of mere
numbers

ock flat mouth came up to us
turned on his heel and retired into
the timber i endeavored to engage
him in conversation but he would not talk
the girl said his silence meant he had lost
gentlemen of the north



hope that he believed the enemy would
receive reinforcements before night i
insisted he was still angry because i had
not shot at the sioux while she slept on
my shoulder then we sat side by side
trying to conceal from each other our
anxiety as we watched the sun and kept
an eye on the few indians they too
seemed more interested in the upper
reaches of the red than in us like our-
selves they were watching for the coming
of their tribesmen

  the sun was all but lost behind the
western rim and the long shadows cast
by the indians in front of us would soon
fade with the twilight now the race
between the red scoundrels and the sun
was almost run my heart began jumping
most erratically the girl seemed lost in a
reverie so i left her to see what was going
on north of the timber

  the indians were dismounted and
stretched across the plain to prevent our
making a break there were no shadows
now and the light had perceptibly dimmed
i knew how quickly the light fled in these
vast areas of loneliness once the sun gave
up the fight only a few minutes more
and we would hope for the best a warrior
sprang to his feet and stared toward the
river i believed he had glimpsed the
pillager he said something and other
warriors stood up one even standing on his
horse

  then came a high pitched call from the
river with an extravagant display of
joy they answered the call sprang to their
ponies and began riding back and forth
from the other side of the timber came a
yelping chorus

  mr franklin mr franklin called
the bell-like voice of miss dearness

  i ran back much alarmed and found
she had come as far as the rivulet in search
of me

  theyre coming she said

  i raced to the edge of the woods and
beheld them riding far apart waving
their weapons and shouting their war-songs
as they slowly cantered towards us drop-
ping on one knee i covered the man riding
in advance of the line whose elaborate head-
dress marked him as the bearer of the pipe
on this expedition i sent a ball through
his chest most neatly and as his spirit fled
tn the land of many lodges his followers
came to a confused halt i fired again

this time knocking a man half round in
his saddle but not dismounting him in-
stantly the survivors scurried back as
i was reloading flat mouth came through
the bushes and motioned for me to follow
him i hesitated to leave the girl but she
urged

  go theyve learned their lesson
theyll keep back

  flat mouth hurried diagonally across
the timber and emerged on the lower
edge near the river drawing me down
beside him he pointed to the east bank
and grunted-

  sioux

  i heard their signal i informed him
they came down the river on the other
side when it gets very dark they will
bring their horses over they heard your
gun and they dont want to try it just now
when they cross we can not break
through i said

  we will all be killed if we stay in the
woods you must stop them from crossing
their horses for a little while the sioux
on this side feel sure of a coup they will
not fight till their friends join them stay
here till it gets too dark to shoot i will
take medicine hair and the horses to the
end of the timber when they attack on
both sides we must ride after the sun
west

  it leads from home but it is the nearest
way there we can strike the cheyenne
near the lac du diable country there
are many good hiding places there

  the bushes across the river swayed and
a painted face showed through the dusk
as one of the newcomers stood up to signal
the horsemen on our side knowing i
could not begin too soon to teach them
their place i rested the gun on flat
mouths shoulder aimed a bit high and
had the satisfaction of seeing the brave go
sprawling down the bank his head and
shoulders remaining under water this
kill wrung a chorus of devilish yells from the
hidden warriors flat mouth hurled his
war-cry at them and danced in great glee

  i reloaded and urged the pillager to
return to the girl and prepare her for making
the tip of the grove reluctantly he left
me swinging to the north to take a final
look at the horsemen there and i settled
down to waiting

  objects began to fade out of my vision
trees near by became blurred and unreal


adventure

i knew our supreme effort could not be long
delayed the surface of the water became
a black waste and i thought i heard a faint
splash opposite my position now voices
began calhng loudly farther down the river
the newcomers had gone to find a crossing
i could see no reason why i should not put
after the chief and the girl then the soft
splashing was repeated this time nearer

  quitting the bushes i crawled through
the mud to the edge of the bank and heard
a rippling sound that was not made by the
lap-lap of the water on the narrow beach
suddenly a vague shape stood before me
within twenty feel and i fired he did
not have time to utter his death cry before
slumping back into the current trailing
my gun i ducked into the woods and fol-
lowed up the rivulet

  the pillager and miss dearness were
about half-way to the end of the timber
when i overtook them it seems she had
refused to go further until i joined them

  take her and go on viciously directed
flat mouth thrusting the bridles of the
three horses into my hands

  no time for you to count a coup
i warned as he turned back

  very soon i shall be at your heels he
promised

  our progress was slow because of the
difficulty in avoiding the frequent clumps
of willows from the plain on the north
came the sound of much singing from
the south the indians were racing their
horses impudently near the woods and
yelling derisively i gave the girl the
bridles to hold while i recharged my gun
we had nearly reached the end of our cover
and the underbrush was thinning out when
the girl caught my hand and whispered-

  theyre trying to burn us out

  i sniffed and detected smoke a thin reek
of burning grass i wet my finger and
tested the faint breeze it still held from
the south creeping to the edge of the
plain i could make out moving shapes as
the indians rode up and down the front
of the timber but there were no fires
burning on this side and a blaze lighted
on the north would sweep away from
us

  returning to miss dearness i reassured
her

  then there is only one other explana-
tion she said flat mouth has set the
grass afire on the north side of us

  it will bum to the turtle perhaps to
the park

  some one is coming she warned and
again her hand instinctively closed over
mine

  i cocked the gun and rested it over a
saddle not bothering to release my hand

  it is eshkebugecoshe softly called a
voice

  the girl dropped my hand hurriedly
without pausing flat mouth took charge
of the horses and pressed ahead while i
guarded the rear now the smoke was
very noticeable and our animals showed a
tendency to bolt

  you fired the grass i whispered

  in many places he grunted the
sioux are spreading out and watching for
us to ride through under cover of the smoke
the warriors on the other side will think
were escaping and will ride into the woods
we were at the end of the timber and
the girl mounted her pony and adjusted
her white robe

  dead ahead sounded the pounding of
hoofs and an indian screamed something
flat mouth interpreted

  he says for the men to ride through the
woods some to go to the river some to
come up here some to follow the fire and
see if we are there some to keep in front
of it wait for me here and do not fire the
gun unless you have to

  before we could restrain him he was
galloping toward the messenger his white
robe making him resemble a sioux warrior
whose skins were white with clay i heard
him salute the sioux in that tongue the
other asked something in a sharp insistent
voice the next moment there was the
blurr of a struggle then the clump of a
falling body a horseman was riding
toward me i cocked my piece but flat
mouth softly commanded

  hurry hurry

  then he took the girls pony by the halter
and led the way out into the plain

chapter vih

we meet black cats people

on our left the warriors were entering
the woods on our right they were
riding their ponies through the fire to find
us behind the smoke had it been autumn
there would have been no passing the
gentlemen of the north



flames but with the short stubble sprinkled
with the new grass trying to gain the sun
and with the ground still wet there was no
danger the smoke the night and the
shouting brought much confusion to the
enemy away from it all we rode the girl
and the pillager in advance and i scamper-
ing behind with my two barrels ready

  our escape must have been quickly dis-
covered as we had not traveled more than
two miles before we heard shouting to-the
north and abreast of us we slowed our
animals to a walk our course tending a bit
south of west and which if persisted in
would bring us to the cheyenne river
the sioux knew we were somewhere south
of them and were concentrating all their
efforts in throwing a barrier across the
plains to prevent our turning north towards
the pembina

  i rode up beside the girl she reached
out patted my arm and said-

  ive made you a lot of bother

  life out here is made up of bothers
im glad to find one thats worth while
you say it very nicely she approved
but i wont be a bother to any one again
if i can get out of this so long as i could
manage without being helped it was my
place to stay now that i find i have to
shift my responsibilities i am anxious to go
back east i never had believed it but i
do now a woman is sure to need help
sometime

  she wouldnt be a woman if she didnt
i declared even men expect to help
each other in this country

  he doesnt have to ask another to see
to it he isnt taken prisoner she gravely
replied i had no right to ask you an-
other example of dodging responsibilities
god forbid it should ever have to be
but you wouldnt let them take me
alive she fiercely demanded

  no man would i answered

  again she patted my arm and mur-
mured-

  if we had met back east we might have
been such friends

  the wind whipped a strand of her hair
across my face and in that moment she
was all feminine-dependent and her pres-
ence became a tonic i was saved from
replying to her last speech-a foolish speech
as there was nothing to prevent our being
such friends out here-by a warning hiss
from the pillager

  he leaped to the ground and ordered us
to do likewise i helped the girl to dis-
mount and the chief caught her pony by
the nose to keep him from giving an alarm
while i muzzled my own beast and waited
a thudding of hoofs not more than four
men as the pillager whispered drew
nearer they were bearing directly down
on us and i was anxious to release my
animal and make ready to fire flat
mouth warned

  be still see that the horse doesnt
call out they cant see us

  i knew this must be true as we could
see nothing of them on they came and
raced by in front of us and very close-
a suggestion of motion as if something had
disturbed the darkness and left a swirl
of darkness behind it these were spies
sent out to learn our true position above
us on the right the enemy kept calling back
and forth as they patrolled from east to
west still on foot we resumed our flight
the chief picking his course without any
hesitation i suggested the necessity of a
turning movement before daylight but he
discouraged it saying

  we must keep this way till light then
we must hide this is a big war-party
it will be ashamed to go back and face the
women without scalps to pay for the braves
we have killed these are the sioux of
the plains very cruel and fierce once
they held the country along the lower red
river they are always at war with the
chippewas

  for just where are we striking

  the bend of the cheyenne it is very
rough and heavily wooded along the river
the sioux claim the country we can
hide there a few days and then go home
from what he said i judged the distance
to be covered was about forty miles i
know that we rode and walked all night
long with the sioux hovering to the north
of us during much of the journey when
the east began lighting its fires and we were
permitted to see the plain around us i was
delighted by two discoveries the plain
was empty of indians and a short distance
ahead a thick growth marked the course
of the cheyenne where it made its northern
loop

  the girl swayed in her saddle and i rode
closer to her

  i was asleep she drowsily murmured
leaning against my arm dreamed the


adventure

indians had captured me that you came

  again her head dropped and it was a
long time before i learned of the heroics i
played in that particular dream

  flat mouth led the way into the growth
going ahead to make sure no grizzlies were
waiting to pounce upon our horses after
securely hobbling the animals so they
could not escape he disappeared in the
direction of the river which flowed unseen
near-by i spread out the skin and three
of the robes and induced the girl to lie down
then i placed the remaining robes over her
to keep out the morning chill and promised
to call her for breakfast

  searching the edge of the growth i col-
lected an armful of dry sticks which i knew
would not smoke and by the time i had
done this flat mouth appeared with several
wild geese he attended to the cooking
making a fire so small as to seem ridiculous
to a white man as he broiled the fowl he
told me the trees were ripped and seamed
by bears claws and that both banks of the
river must be teeming with the animals
i had nothing but contempt for the black
and brown varieties knowing them to be
harmless but the grizzly was a different
proposition flat mouth insisted how-
ever that these seldom attacked unless
cornered or wounded

  the girl woke up and after she had
eaten the chief and i stuffed ourselves
then he insisted that we try to get some
sleep the sun was half-way through its
days work when i opened my eyes the
girl was seated with her back to a tree
her hair a marvel of neatness she had
thrown a robe over me and this little act
so meaningless to those never initiated into
the wilds affected me strangely it was
the first time in many years that any one
had taken thought for my comfort cer-
tainly the first wherein a woman had given
me any attention since i was a child in the
states and under my mothers care my
first sensation was that of being moth-
ered i liked it all men do let them
disclaim to the contrary as they will

  i half closed my eyes and for several
minutes pretended to be asleep that i might
watch her her blue eyes were serene
her fine features were softened by repose
here in a position of great danger she
impressed me as revealing her true self
her genuine womanliness at the x y
post where no physical harm could intrude

she had been cold hard and unapproach-
able

  at last she caught me spying and colored
furiously instinctively feeling of her hair

  where is the chief i innocently asked

  she pointed and i arose and beheld him
sleeping lying on his face when i stepped
toward him he came to his senses and
sprang to his feet like a wildcat our
voices had not disturbed him but my step
had subconsciously perhaps he had cata-
logued our voices but a stealthy step was
not so easily classified he always insisted a
person woke up more easily and more com-
pletely-woke up all over as he expressed
it-if he slept on his face the girl insisted
that he finish out his nap but he replied he
was filled with sleep and would need no
more till another day

  the girl said that during our slumbers
there had been no signs of life on the plain
except the buffalo and their lurking escort
of gray wolves she had heard sounds
back in the woods and once a red deer
had poked his head through the bushes to
look us over

  i went with flatmouth to the river
where he fashioned several drinking-dishes
out of bark and while there we saw seven
grizzlies descend the opposite shore to
drink they were huge brutes and more
to be feared than the sioux should they
take a notion to attack the pillager ob-
served them unconcernedly however as-
suring me that they would not bother us
if we did not trouble them

  the river he reminded was seldom
visited by assiniboin cree or chippewa
because die sioux claimed it from fear
of attacks from the northern indians the
sioux in turn seldom came there except
in war strength so all animal life had
been left to develop undisturbed by man
the bears had not been hunted and did
not know man as a destroyer this was
all very comforting as long as i could believe
it but the thought of the girl back in the
little glade alone with these monsters
wandering about in batches of seven
made me anxious to return

  we took water to her and on the way
started up red deer which were nowhere
near as shy as those on the red river
leaving her again we visited the horses
and found them contentedly grazing inside
the fringe of bushes and willows leaving
the chief with them i rejoined the girl
gentlemen of the north

ioi

must we wait until night before
starting home she eagerly asked
i believe that is the chiefs idea
he knows the country and the indians far
better than we do we must take no
foolish risks

  if you were alone would you start now
she asked

in truth i should have but i said nothing
then pretend im a man lets go at
once she cried with a show of impatience
and she stood and began gathering up the
robes

  my imagination was incapable of detect-
ing anything masculine in her splendid
womanhood i could not suppress a small
smile at her suggestion instantly she
was the woman of the x y post and was
commanding

  call the indian tell him we start at
once

  flat mouth appeared on the scene before
i could remonstrate with her in chip-
pewa she repeated to him her intention of
starting for the red river he shook his
head saying-

   we must stay here a little longer

  you two can stay i will go alone
the country is perfectly safe the sioux
have lost the trail entirely

  i have no doubt she would have taken a
pony and set forth if i had not stopped her
saying

  you cant go alone well take orders
from the pillager

  ill take orders from no one she
haughtily informed i suppose i may
have one of the horses seeing that they
belonged to the sioux

  no

  very well i can make it afoot she
calmly said

  whats the matter with you i angrily
inquired cant you reason or is it
your temper 

i thought she was trying to annihilate
me with her furious gaze by an effort
she mastered herself and quietly retorted
my temper is nothing to you were
thrown together by a series of mishaps i
appreciate your coming to find me but if
your coming makes you feel any responsi-
bility for my acts im sorry you came
the lord forbid i should ever have to
be responsible for such a bundle of spite
as you seem to be i peevishly protested
she smiled with her lips turned and

walked towards the plain i caught up
with her and demanded-

  what do you plan

   im on my way to the x y post she
lazily informed

   unless you return to cover at once the
pillager and i will tie you

   you would never dare she gritted
turning on me like a cat

   all my silly resentment dropped from me
and i gently explained

  miss dearness i should never dare to
look a man red or white in the face if
i allowed you to start alone for the red

i wont threaten again to tie you but if you
start for the red ill go with you its
hardly fair to let the pillager go with us
as he is of a different race

   she fought the battle with herself her
red hair being a true gage of her temper
suddenly she surrendered murmuring

  i was wrong well go back to the
chief

 youre tired your nerves are out of
tune in a few hours it will be night then
we can go

  it isnt my nerves she contritely
corrected its just temper

  my temper is off the key of course
i spoke foolishly when i said i would tie-
you

 ill obey orders	 

  flat mouth had watched us without
a lineament of his strong face betraying
that he could either see or hear when
we joined him he gave her a quick look and
walked towards the horses she remained
silent not inclined to talk i waited some
minutes to see if she desired companionship
then went after the pillager

  the chief was crouching behind some
cherry trees and had i observed shifted
the horses deeper into the growth he was
staring intently out on the plain he
motioned for me to drop beside him my
heart gave a thump for i had been so
positive we had shaken the sioux off our trail
that this hint of their presence weakened
me for a moment

   assiniboins he said

  where i demanded he pointed to
the northern rim- and by much staring
through half-closed lids i managed to make
out some dots

   buffaloes i decided

   assiniboins he repeated

  then theyre friendly they wont


adventure

do anything worse than try to steal our
horses

  theyve killed traders when catching
them alone these are not of the same
band that comes to the pembina

  all the assiniboins are good robe-
makers theyre all friendly with the
whites i persisted

  these are not any red river band if
they see us they will do their best to kill
us and take our horses i am an indian
i tell you i know this

  as a trader i had had experience only
with straggling bands of the tribe it was
hard for me to believe that i had anything
to fear from a people who begged rum
rations from me and who went and came
when i gave the word my incredulity must
have been obvious for the chief hissed out-
do you think eshkebugecoshe is afraid
no he was not afraid he had lived
with mandans and had fought with them
and their allies the crows against these
same assiniboins and the sioux the
tribe had taken to horses being a migratory
people and forever chasing the buffalo
and horses they must have that they
would appropriate ours if they got the
chance went without saying but i had sup-
posed the theft would be committed with
stealth and in no event be accompanied
with violence

  say what is to be done and we will do it
i agreed

  we will wait until they go if they
come down here we will follow up the
river he replied then very significantly-
they must not see the white woman
she was big medicine to them once
i reminded

  to those who came to the pembina
but the voice is back on the river that
calls and this band would kill her to
prevent it being stolen again

  i remembered what the girl had told me
much to the same effect and if flat mouth
was not afraid i was

  yet i still hoped and half believed the
dark objects were buffaloes at so great
a distance it is impossible to detect any
but the most rapid motion a horse
galloping at full speed will scarcely appear
to be moving so far as the dots were
concerned they appeared to be stationary
we rose to go back to the camp and i was
debating whether it was necessary to in-
form miss dearness of this possible new

peril when the pillager gave a sharp yelp
and went bounding through the bush as if
the devil were nipping his heels believing
the girl was in some danger i charged after
him when i entered the glade he was
furiously stamping out a little fire miss
dearness stood at one side anxiously
watching him

  what have i done now she whispered
to me

  nothing i warmly assured scowling
at the pillager

  green bark he grunted and tilting
his head he pointed upward even with
the fire extinguished there was a pale haze
floating clear of the tree tops

   i belittled it saying-

  an eagle couldnt see that eshke-
bugecoshe

  they have sacrificed dogs to their
manito their medicine is strong he
gloomily retorted

  whats the matter mr franklin are
the sioux near cried miss dearness

  not a sioux in sight the pillager and
i disagree about some dots out on the plain
he says theyre assiniboins i say they
are buffaloes

  and he fears they saw the smoke
she cried wringing her hands now ive
brought new danger on you two by my
thoughtlessness it was so dreary waiting
i forgot myself i threw some green bark
on the hot ashes to see it curl up-it burst
into flame-then i fed on some green sticks
-i bring bad luck

  nonsense i sharply replied is it
surprizing that a band of thieving indians
should stumble upon us here they will
stand dear of my gun its stood off their
betters

  i turned to flat mouth and boasted the
same to him

   he shook his head energetically

   its no medicine to the assiniboins the
crees or the chippewas they have seen
it and its two barrels and the truth has
gone through the three tribes they are
two shots afraid that is all soon the
sioux of the plains will know about it
then it wont be medicine to them

he ran back to watch the dots
and miss dearness and i followed
him now they were no longer
dots but mounted men they had drawn
near enough for us to be sure of this and
gentlemen of the north



yet they strangely resembled buffaloes  it
was not until a line of them raced parallel
to our hiding place that i discovered the
cause for my fancy each warrior wore
on his head a covering of buffalo hide to
which were fixed two horns in some cases
tliis strange head-gear comprised the whole
head of the creature the skull bones having
been carefully removed and the skin worn
as a hood

  they seemed to be racing about aim-
lessly and i rejoiced to the pillager-

  they didnt see the smoke

  it was such a tiny smoke they couldnt
added miss dearness

  the pillagers answer was a silent drama
without a word he reached over his shoulder
and pulled arrows from his quiver with-
out removing his gaze from the swiftly
maneuvering horsemen he placed the ar-
rows before him in a row then caught up
his bow and drew the cord taut miss
dearness glanced at me with a little frown
worrying her forehead

  they think were here i asked flat
mouth

  they know it he tersely responded

  to my way of thinking the horsemen
were not acting suspiciously one of them
the leader whirled a disk of rawhide from
the point of his lance and the riders raced
to where it fell jabbing and spearing until
one managed to pick it up he in turn
carried it triumphantly aloft until hard
pressed when he sent it sailing from him
and again the mad scramble to obtain it

  i doubted the pillagers bald assertion
until i noted that the rawhide was always
being sent in our direction each rush
brought the band closer now the chief
had the piece of hide and his men were
strung out behind him in undulating loops
like the letter s greatly prolonged my
eyes were distracted by the constantly
shifting loops yet the leader with each
maneuver brought them nearer to the
woods

  theyre coming i softly warned as the
first loop suddenly swung far forward so as
to line up fully thirty warriors riding
abreast with their chief on their left

  fire the gun and get back to the
horses ordered flat mouth snatching up
an arrow

  with a terrific shout the whole band
came toward us i fired both barrels into
the front rank and a miss was impossible

flat mouths bow began to twang and his
arrows streamed into the center of the
assault

  get to the horses he cried and then
raised a war-cry

  it was not the pillagers yell but the cry
of the sioux and faster and faster flew
the arrows i seized the girls wrist and
urged her to the camp i had barely
slipped the hobbles and gathered up the
halter ropes when flat mouth came
gliding to us his face exalted with the lust
of battle against great odds without a
word he took his horse and began leading
the way along a deer-path that led up-
stream the girl rode behind him and i
on foot brought up the rear

  i managed to reload one barrel and as
nothing happened i halted and charged
the other the way was rough and at
every rod we read the signs of much game
little piles of hair at the foot of trees whose
bark was worn smooth showed that the
buffaloes penetrated the thickets in con-
siderable numbers signs of bears were
the most plentiful however it was a
pelt-hunters paradise if he could gather the
toll without losing his scalp

  after an hour of continuous travel the
pillager halted and briefly explained

  they didnt dare to enter the woods
at first thinking the sioux were there
my sioux war-cry and the sioux arrows
fooled them theyll soon find out their
mistake their men are creeping in now
soon theyll see where only two men and a
woman camped soon they will come
fast

  what shall we do now asked miss
dearness

  cross the river and strike for the
mandan villages on the missouri was the
astounding answer

  i gasped aloud in dismay leave the
post with only foolish probos on duty
with old tabashaw having free rein to in-
timidate to bully and to consume the
companys rum run to the missouri to
escape while home was so near

  it must be so growled the chief
guessing my reluctance only in that
way can we save the white woman

  to the mandan villages it is then
i agreed

  im willing to risk turning back spoke
up miss dearness

  eshkebugecoshe is not willing grimly


adventure

retorted the chief i killed some of them
and the gun killed some when they see
how they were tricked only one torture will
satisfy them wait while i look at the
river

  he glided down the rough and heavily
timbered bank while he was gone i
strained my eyes seeing an enemy in every
bush and stump at last he returned and
without speaking led his pony down the
slope i estimated our position to be
directly south of the lac du diable country
and i knew from talks with the post
indians that the river woods we were now
traversing thinned out into scattering
willows a few miles farther west

 the river was once occupied by the
cheyennes who served as a barrier between
the sioux and the chippewas being neutral
to both more than half a century before
the chippewas a very jealous people by
nature got the idea the neutrals were
favoring the sioux in trade while return-
ing from an unsuccessful expedition a war-
party of chippewas fell on a cheyenne
village and killed many the cheyennes
promptly migrated across the missouri and
since then the red shadow of the sioux has
hung over the chippewas with no neutral
nation between to minimize the shock of an
attack

  the crossing was not difficult and we
made it easily and surmounted the opposite
bank but lefl a trail a bull buffalo could
read flat mouth held up his hand for
silence and cocked his ear  heard nothing
beyond the usual noise of wood life

  theyre following our trail he warned
if we stick to the woods they will overtake
us our only chance is to take to the
open now and ride for it our horses are
fresh theirs are tired once on the plain
we can leave them

  but theyll chase us asked the girl

  he nodded and to cheer her up added

  we shall find some mandans or some
of the big bellies minnetarees hunting
buffalo they will help us

  we broke through the timber and started
for the southwest at a gallop we had
gone not more than a fourth of a mile when
a ringing cry sounded behind us glancing
back i beheld a warrior dancing and waving
his arms at the edge of the timber we
had not advanced more than half a mile
before nearly a hundred horsemen emerged
from the woods

  flat mouth was worried for well he knew
that it would take more than an ordinary
hunting party to stand off such a force
at the start the chances favored us as our
animals were well rested whereas the
enemys had been ridden far and fast
there was no question as to our maintain-
ing a safe leadproviding none of our animals
met with an accident realizing this my
eyes became focused on the flying feet
of miss dearness mount at every stride
i expected to see a hoof stick into a hole
and hurl her to the ground leaving one of
our mounts to carry double i glanced
back once more and beheld even more
warriors quitting the woods

  flat mouth grimly explained

  big war-party going to fight the
mandans we shall have them all the
way

  he insisted it was the medicine of the
girls hair that permitted us to drop them
before night came i felt a great uplift
when with the last light i failed to make
out their figures against the northern
sky-line the chief quietly assured me
they would be on our trail in the morning

  we camped that night in the bed of a dry
coulee the chief managed to kill a buffalo
calf with his bow and arrow and we ven-
tured to build a small fire fencing it about
with our white robes over this we
broiled some excellent steaks and cooked
enough to carry with us on the morrow
at daybreak we were up and beheld figures
creeping over the horizon

  the country grew rougher with each
hour and we lost the assiniboins only
when we dropped into the hollows on
surmounting ridge or hillock we raised them
to view again tenaciously sticking to our
track flat mouth had eyes only for
what was ahead seeking for some oppor-
tunity of shaking the enemy off i was
always staring behind me fascinated by the
implacable purpose that held the savages
to the chase the girl rode with head
bowed seldom bothering to lift her gaze
from the ground her fear was an accident
to her pony

  we began to encounter coulees filled with
water each a sign-post for the couteau du
missouri the rough and hilly country we
must cross before descending to the mis-
souri river the pillager believed the
assiniboins would not venture beyond this
height of land yet they were in such
gentlemen of the north



strong force they might recklessly risk an
encounter with mandan or minnetaree

ahead were the steep red banks
of the missouri at our feet were
two cows freshly slain flat mouth
inspected them and for the first time since
our flight from the cheyenne his immobile
features showed animation

  the brains have been taken to dress
hides hunters did it not a war-party
after meat only mandans hunt here

  the assiniboins had been lost to sight
for a day in their place we were dreading
a sioux war-party for the sioux hung
closely about the mandan villages seeking
to pick off a victim or two to the north
of the villages was a stretch of timber
and in this cover small bands of the sioux
would hide and wait for days being satisfied
if they killed a lone hunter or a woman
we had passed through the rough country
of the couteau and had an excellent view
of the river in the southeast flat mouth
insisted we were too far down-stream and
said we must cross a high and precipitous
bank on our right to me it seemed a
needless exertion as we could round the
end of the ridge by skirting its base until
it broke off at the river but the chief felt
the menace of the sioux and must have
his way i did not believe the horses
could make the ridge for the soil was
glutinous mud from the spring rains

  the pillager dismounted to demonstrate
what an indian pony could do and with
the beast scrambling like a cat he led the
way up the slope miss dearness made
light of it although she was forced to
climb it afoot on reaching the top we
had a more intimate view of the river
the valley was some two miles in width
and caged in by steep banks the current
was sluggish and swollen dotted with much
driftwood and many black dots which
i knew to be drowned buffalo imme-
diately below us was a growth of big cotton-
woods and from our position to these
woods ran a well-beaten path

  for the first time since our race began
i presumed to take the lead but before
i could do more than press ahead to the
brow of the ridge flat mouth was halting
me and explaining that the way was full
of dangers and that he must go first i
placed my gun across my saddle but the
danger was not animate and consisted

of certain deep holes or pits the indians
had dug for trapping fox and wolves
these pits were ten or more feet deep with
the openings masked by the dead grass

  we descended slowly and cautiously
skirting several of these menaces and
i know i should have plunged into the
first one had i had my way at the foot of
the ridge the pillager reined in and warned

  we must say we have come from fort
assiniboin that the medicine hair is the
daughter of the big white chief there and
that we work for him the big white chief
wishes to open a post here and sends his
daughter because her medicine lets her see
things we men can not see he has told
us to stay but a few days and to ask for
warriors to go back with us as far as the
mouse the mandans must not know
we were driven here by the assiniboins
they would think the white womans
medicine was weak and that her father
was a little chief if they knew the assini-
boins had made us run

  why cant we start back as soon as we
get fresh horses i anxiously asked my
mind reverting to the incompetent probos
in charge of the post and to old tabashaw
bullying him for rum

  and why must we travel by the way
of the mouse demanded miss dearness
referring to the long route to the confluence
of the mouse and the quappelle thence
down the assiniboin to the forks where
we would turn south up the red

  we must stay and look about as if look-
ing for a good place for a post flat mouth
patiently explained then to the girl-
we must come from fort assiniboin to
show why we are here we must go back
the same way to make our talk sound
straight even if we could pick our trail
we must return by way of the mouse and
the assiniboin it is the regular path and
safer

  i told miss dearness the chief was right
and that a few days wouldnt make much
difference that we ought to be thankful
at having escaped the sioux and the
assiniboins-this to cheer her up

  oh we will go through with it she
wearily replied i was thinking of you
and your affairs more than of mine i
have no trade to lose angus can watch
the post till i get back or my successor
arrives

  with our story understood we started
io

adventure

ahead taking the semblance of a road
which had been much traveled but never
repaired it was filled with mud and holes
and eloquently revealed the ravages of the
spring freshet we followed this into the
woods and continued through the growth
for two miles it was most abominable
traveling at last we were clear of it and
were come to a riot of beans squash and
corn sprouts but so mixed with grass that
i proclaimed it to be mighty poor garden-
ing i was disappointed as i had heard
much about the mandans as agricultur-
ists flat mouth explained however that
these budding growths were runaways
and represented only what the wind had
stolen and sown broadcast the tribes
gardens were farther on

  here is the village warned the girl
she checked her mount and stared
wonderingly and with a little shudder
exclaimed

  its like a village of the dead where
are the indians

  flat mouth twisted uneasily in his saddle
and whispered

  it is a village of the dead-a village they
left when i was here last the gardens
would not grow after so many years the
ground refuses to care for the seed then
they move when they left this place
they used it for their dead

  we pressed ahead a bit and came in full
view of the gruesome exhibit the girl
quailed for a moment then held up her
head and gazed about steadily every-
where were platforms some ten feet in
height and on these were laid the dead
the shrouds were of dressed leather some
in very excellent condition and fit for trade
but for the most part the coverings had
succumbed to the weather and had fallen
apart allowing the bones to show some of
the platforms had fallen to the ground and
no attempt had been made to replace them
or their grim burdens we quickened our
pace and soon were beyond the forbidding
spot

  remember our talk warned the pil-
lager kicking his horse into a gallop and
riding ahead

off at one side and at a distance
was an indian with a gun around
him were women and children
working these were the gardeners and
they were planting and hoeing under an

armed guard this was impressive proof
of their daily danger even at the very
outskirts of their villages they did not
dare to move about without a sentinel
just as the red river of the north always
contained the menace of the sioux so did
the stretch of woods hold for mandan and
minnetaree a hidden danger

  at the pillagers gesture the girl and i
halted while he rode to the man with the
gun i saw the fellow nervously cock
his piece then stand keenly at attention
while flat mouth with both hands above
his head talked to him suddenly the
gun was lowered and the guard was
shaking hands warmly with our companion

  he recognizes him murmured the
girl

  the two conversed for several minutes
then came to us flat mouth announced
it was all right that we were to proceed
and find quarters at the village a short
distance ahead the guard smiled broadly
and shook hands with me but seemed to
stand in awe of miss dearness later i
learned the pillager had filled him with
tales concerning the wonderful medicine
she possessed and her powers as a magician
then the guard looked at my pony and at
the chiefs and said something we could
not understand

  he asks where our presents are
translated the pillager

  he might well be puzzled for beyond
the white robes snugly wrapped in my
blanket we had no possessions no volun-
tary visitor to the villages would fail to
bring a pack-animal or two loaded with
gifts

  before i could scare up an answer the
girl was haughtily saying in chippewa

  tell him the big white chief does not
send gifts by his friends he has slaves
to bring them they will come later he
will decide how much to send after he hears
how we have been treated

  flat mouths eyes twinkled as he listened
but his bearing was stern and haughty as
he translated her words to the guard

  the guard next informed us that an
h b man was living in the village across
the river but was now on the headwaters
of the missouri looking for trade in spring
beaver

  the man returned to his charge and we
rode on all i could think of on first
glimpsing the round domes of the mandan
gentlemen of the north



houses was of a colony of gigantic beavers
these huts were very large some being
ninety feet in diameter and so solidly
built that fifty men could lounge on their
tops at a time the door of each was of
rawhide stretched over willow and was
nearly six feet square a broad porch
led up to this near each porch was a
platform a score of feet long half as wide
and eight or nine feet high on these
platforms they stored their corn to dry in
the fall also their meat but now these
were being used for driftwood

  flat mouth told us the village depended
entirely for their supply of fuel on what
the river brought down each spring
from my view of the swollen stream and
its innumerable trees i could see the toll
must be enormous the reason why we
had not seen more indians in traveling to
the village was because the able-bodied
were bus- swimming in the icy current
and bringing the drift ashore while their
people watched and encouraged them
besides the driftwood they brought drowned
buffalo ashore in large numbers and these
were already giving off the stench of decay
my chippewas would salvage the dead
brutes when the ice went out when the
meat was firm and fresh but the mandans
and the minnetarees the pillager assured
me preferred the tainted to the fresh

  what men i saw on shore were stout and
strongly built and wore their hair trailing
at their heels and even sweeping the ground
as they daubed this daily with red and
white earth the effect was grotesque the
same cough which was troubling our in-
dians seemed to be common with them

  as we entered the village we were dis-
covered and quickly surrounded they
greeted us cordially shaking hands and
seemingly much pleased at our coming
some recognized flat mouth and hailed
him as a friend then they commenced
asking where we had left our packs as
he had explained to the armed guard so now
did the pillager explain to the tribe that
while we represented the greatest traders
of the north we had brought no goods with
us either for trade or for gifts their faces
fell

  the chief continued to explain how our
errand was to investigate the chances of
trade of course he described miss dear-
ness as being a medicine-woman and the
daughter of the big white chief at the head

of the fort on the assiniboin it was
grimly amusing that i should pose as an
engage instead of bourgeois that she of
the opposition should masquerade as my
superior

  the interest miss dearness aroused was
accumulative and it was plain she created
a tremendous impression one young buck
standing close to her pony reached up a
hand to feel the texture of her fiery hair
as quick as loup-cervier her hand rose
and the handle of her leather whip landed
on his wrist causing him to spring back
in dismay i think it was the blazing fire
of her blue eyes rather than any physical
hurt from the blow that startled the fellow

  flat mouth look occasion to warn that
the hair was medicine and that the white
woman had saved the young mans life
by preventing his touching it after that
incident the circle widened in turn the
indians informed us that the sioux had
been very troublesome ever since the snow
melted and that since le borgne the
blind the great war chief of the minne-
tarees on the knife a few miles above had
gone out with a hunting party the mandans
had kept their huts barricaded every night
on his return an alliance was to be formed
with the cheyennes and aggressive mea-
sures taken to teach the enemy a lasting
lesson

  flat mouth to further increase our
prestige and make them forget we came
without gifts now stated that the good-will
of the white woman was worth a war-party
and that her anger was equal to a blast of
lightning

  firmly believing as he did that the girl
possessed powers of magic he did not hesi-
tate to draw a long bow and i was fearing
that she might be requested to bolster up
her reputation by some little display when
a newcomer distracted the attention this
was none less than poscopsahe or black
cat the chief of the village we were
presented to him and he was duly im-
pressed by the girl and assured her that
the big white chief would do well to send
traders there and to the minnetaree vil-
lages above but especially to his village
of the mandans this jealousy when it
came to acquiring the white mans goods
in trade was very keen among the villages
although they would unite readily and
solidly enough in opposing their ancient
enemies
io

adventure

  through the pillager the girl calmly
replied that she had heard the mandans
had a good trade in robes and buffalo
tongues and a fair trade in beaver that
she would look the villages over for a day
or so and then report back to fort assini-
boin

  with these ceremonies out of the way we
were shown to a hut reserved for visitors

i took my pack of white robes inside
and turned the horses over to a young man
one of the chiefs wives followed us to the
hut with a huge dish of boiled corn and
beans a tasteless mess and another of
dried meat the latter was impossible
jecause of the mandans preference for
tainted to fresh meat so on the whole we
nade a sorry meal of it

- despite our explanation that we had no
goods to trade nor gifts to bestow the men
women and children crowded about our
hut eager for us to open our packs the
fact that they had seen all our possessions
namely my bundle of robes did not spoil
their imagination white people always
had gifts always wanted to trade they
believed that in some mysterious manner
we would produce articles of the white
mans making which they were so eager to
secure  it was with the greatest difficulty
that flat mouth persuaded them to believe
we had nothing to trade and their attitude
was sullen when they finally withdrew

  after they left us in peace the pillager
advised that we take up different quarters
urging that by doing so we would create a
better impression so we decided that
miss dearness should remain in the guest
hut with the chiefs wife as attendant
while the pillager and i found shelter else-
where leaving her with the indian
woman we went out to look the village
over the mandans being a settled people
had no need for dogs so this nuisance was
not in evidence the children too were
quite decently mannered although they
would have stolen the clothes off my back
had i given them a chance the population
of this and the village across the river was
about two thousand flat mouth said i
suggested we cross over and visit the second
village flat mouth called out to some
young men and on my giving them a few
inches of tobacco they readily agreed to
set us across

  proceeding to the river i had my first
sight of a bull-boat as their curious skin

canoes are called they were much differ-
ent from the skin canoes we used on the
red river being circular in shape and
formed of raw buffalo hides stretched over
a frame of willow the craft had the
appearance of being very frail and not a
bit suitable for navigating the swollen and
muddy waters of the missouri yet each
was capable of carrying eight hundred
pounds or more

  one man did the paddling and his paddle
was a five-foot pole with a strip of board
lashed across the end with his first stroke
the boat turned nearly around but he
quickly reversed us with a stroke on the
other side first one was looking up-stream
at the mass of floating trees and dead
buffalo then down-stream it made me
dizzy yet our man was an expert for we
drifted less than a quarter of a mile whereas
the average boatman would have drifted a
full mile

the news of our arrival in the first
mandan village had spread across
the river and on landing we were
met by a crowd of natives headed by big
man a cheyenne prisoner and now adopted
into the tribe-a man of prominence he
shook us warmly by the hand and anxiously
asked why we had left all our packs in
black cats village the tedious explana-
tion was given by flat mouth and the
interest of the assemblage flattened out
and many turned away to resume the work
of towing trees and dead buffalo ashore

  through the pillager i learned from big
man that the minnetaree village was much
excited over the arrival of six cheyennes
seeking a peace treaty messengers had
been sent for le borgne to bring him back
from the hunt black days were waiting
for the sioux once the treaty was per-
fected we paraded the village finding it
a duplicate of the one across the river we
vere invited into several huts to eat but
always found the meat abominable on
the outskirts of the village women with
hoes made from buffalo shoulder-blades
were working in their gardens with armed
men stationed at intervals their danger
was intimate much like that which sur-
rounds some of the smaller wood-folk who
live under stumps sporting and raising
their little families while death stalks them
day and night

  the pillager mumbled to me- i
gentlemen of the north



  we must go back now

  i had known him long enough to realize
that he was disturbed at something
thanking big man and telling him he
should have presents when our traders
arrived we returned to the river and were
ferried across

  something makes my brother sad
i remarked in chippewa after we had
stepped ashore

  i was glad when i heard that the blind
was away on a buffalo hunt my heart is
heavy now for they send to bring him home
to meet the cheyennes

  you believed we should find him here
before we arrived i reminded

  i knew and hoped for the best when
we came and found him gone my heart
sang i believed we should get away
before he returned now to find he will
come back makes me sorry

  the blind does not like white men
he likes white men was the laconic
response

  then why feel sad to know he is coming
back

  he likes women he has never seen
such a woman as medicine hair he is
a mighty war chief his word is law in
both minnetaree and mandan villages
when we fought the sioux and the assini-
boins i thought only of escaping to a place
where we would not be killed i knew we
would not be harmed in these villages
now i have had time to think what the
blind wants he takes

  the danger must be pressing when an
indian would be troubled over the fate
of a white woman his words reduced
my complacency to ashes i could only
say-

  we must start before he comes back
they will think our coming is a trick
if we go away too quickly he warned
i will talk with the mandans and ask if
they have seen any signs of assiniboins
or sioux to the north we must visit the
villages but in one or two sleeps we might
start for the mouse once we reach fort
assiniboin the medicine hair will be safe
but le borgne would be very blind to
make the whites angry by taking one of
their women i protested

  flat mouth smiled in grim pity at my
ignorance

  you do not know the blind he mur-
mured he takes what he wants no

chief is as powerful as he when i was
here before he took a woman from a
mandan chief who went with his war-club
to bring her back they buried his war-
club with him he likes white men he
will treat you better than his warriors
but he doesnt let anything stand between
him and the thing he wants

from the end of the village rose
the girls wonderful voice singing
her quaint song in which one heard
the rush of the river and the sighing of the
wind a voice of sadness and pathos yet
colored with a rare beauty for the first
time i realized there were no indians hang-
ing about us begging for tobacco and gifts
we walked to the guest-hut and found the
entire village grouped about it black cat
was seated on a robe before the entrance
smoking his missouri tobacco-villainous
stuff-and wondering at the medicine of her
voice

  when she sings her medicine song i see
the leaves turn yellow and drop and i feel
the first of the snow i hear the ice break-
ing up and smell the first grass said black
cat as we stood beside him

  she calls the voices from rivers and
sends them back when she is tired of them
flat mouth boasted she is very strong
medicine it is her hair the chippewas
are afraid of her

  the chippewas are old women snorted
black cat

  flat mouths visage grew very wicked
from inside the robe he was wearing
mandan-fashion he pulled forth a grisly
string of sioux scalps shook them in black
cats face and hoarsely taunted

  i am a chippewa i do not hide in
a village when the sioux of the plains
come near i go out and kill them have
the mandans any old women who take
scalps like these

  it was a master-stroke for putting the
beggars in their proper place the cat
was unable to speak for a full minute his
eyes glowed and gloated over the trophies
he sprang to his feet and loudly proclaimed
my chippewa brother is a very brave
man i will adopt him as a son he shall
have a new war name he shall have
many wives he shall carry the pipe for us
against our enemies

  i feared flat mouth would indulge in
more boasting and scornfully flout the
no

adventure

chiefs offer but his finesse was sharpened
because of the girls peril he replied-
after i have taken medicine hair back
ta her father

  this gave the cat great pleasure he
pictured himself basking in the glory of
his new son the recipient of homage the
possessor of many scalps he loudly an-
nounced he would give a feast for the
mighty chippewa and forthwith directed
his wives to prepare an abundance of stink-
ing meat corn and beans the indians
scattered in all directions to make ready
for the festival black cat hurried off to
see his commands were obeyed and with a
glance at me the pillager walked beside
him

  i remained before the hut the door
swung open a crack then wide open and
miss dearness confronted me her eyes
searching mine anxiously

  when can we start from this place
she whispered

  very soon-in a few days

  a few days she faintly exclaimed
something tells me we must start at once
the pillager would say it is your medi-
cine i bantered

  it is instinct it has never failed me
since i came to the indian country let
us start tonight

  but that would invite danger we
must make a pretense of looking the villages
over for trade purposes i protested if
there is any vital any immediate danger
of course we will start at once and fight for
it now tell me just what has happened
nothing has happened she slowly re-
plied her eyes staring into mine and yet
not beholding me but im afraid-i am
horribly afraid-different from anything
i ever felt in my life-im never afraid of
death with this she closed the door
leaving me standing there gaping like a
zany

chapter ix

at the mnnetaree village

early next morning flat mouth and i
went to miss dearness hut and on
her joining us at the porch asked her to
make ready for a trip to the minnetaree
villages a few miles above situated on the
knife river to attempt leaving the
country without visiting these big bel-
lies as the trade had named them would

be to incur the wrath of le borgne and
throw discredit on our story of represent-
ing the n w company and its plan to
set up an opposition to the already estab-
lished h b trader

  the girl was afraid her bearing was
calm and collected enough but there were
transient flashes in her big blue eyes a
curious trick of glancing sidewise through
half closed lids that bespoke a furtive fear
however she readily agreed we must visit
the upper villages to sustain our role she
only insisted that we make all haste to have
it over with

  as i was anxious to go and return before
le borgne came back i directed flat
mouth to engage men to cross our horses
promising them some handsome pipes when
the traders arrived with their assortment of
goods the mandans proved to be as
expert in handling the horses in the river
as they had been in collecting the driftwood
hitching a fine to a nags mouth a brave
would take the end between his teeth and
swim ahead while others swam alongside
and behind the animal in this way the
three were taken across quickly and drifted
down-stream scarcely at all

  when we landed from the bull-boat and
mounted our horses we were surrounded
by the entire village every one being
anxious to gaze on the white woman with
the medicine hair miss dearness would
have drawn her capote over her head but
the pillager urged her not to declaring that
the belief she was a magician would help
us much so she rode between us with
her oriflamme of a head glinting in the early
sunlight and making me think of a maple
turned red by the first frosts

  flat mouth improvised a legend which
he sung as we slowly made our way through
the crowd it was to the effect that beams
of sunlight became imprisoned in the girls
hair when she was born and that their
struggles to escape created the powerful
medicine she possessed

  big man walked by my side and in-
formed me a hunting party of a hundred
braves was due to arrive home after a three
days trip and that if we would postpone
our visit to the minnetarees we could
procure some fresh meat i immediately
feared lest the minnetaree chief le borgne
would be with this party but flat mouth
explained that the minnetarees hunted
to the southwest of the knife and the
gentlemen of the north

hi

mandans to the southeast the river being
the boundary we needed fresh meat
badly but the hunting party would greatly
delay our journey up the river so we
pressed on more determinedly than ever

  i assured miss dearness that we could
make the villages ride through them and
start back for black cats village before
dark on returning and recrossing the
river we could decide whether to start north
immediately unaccompanied or wait till
morning and endeavor to obtain an escort
from the mandans the girl was for an
immediate departure

  i had planned to take my white robes
with me thinking i might have a chance
to trade them for horses they being about
the only thing the minnetarees would ex-
change horses for flat mouth however
insisted such a trade would consume all the
day that the horses we had were fresh
enough and that the hides had better be
left behind in the hut where they would be
perfectly safe

  so we rode forth miss dearness peculiar
type of loveliness was greatly accented by
the appearance of the mandan women
who could not be called comely even by
indian standards i never could under-
stand why the crows the most lascivious
of all the indians i ever met should be the
most prepossessing in appearance or why
the women of the aricaras the most
treacherous of any tribe i ever encountered
should approach the nearest to the white
standard of good looks

  miss dearness was not inclined to talk
and we rode rapidly as if eager to have done
with a disagreeable errand the road we
followed was very decent and led us over
two hills and then for two miles across a
plain skirting a small village which we did
not enter the whole distance was through
an area of gardens which included much
ground given over to the cultivation of sun-
flowers in every direction were horses
grazing on the early grass and flat mouths
eyes glittered as became a true pillager
all these animals were brought into the
villages at night revealing the indians
constant dread of their inveterate enemies
the sioux and the assiniboins the ran-
dans kept their ponies in their huts while
the minnetarees used small corrals

  these villages on the missouri and knife
were distinct from any i ever became ac-
quainted with they suggested per-

manency and a strong devotion to the
soil especially the villages of the mandans
our road along the south bank of the
missouri to the knife afforded almost
continuous glimpses of a bucolic life which
made me think of canadian villages

  all hunting was done in large bands
flat mouth told me for fear of surprize
attacks each hunting party therefore
contained the potentials of a war-party
even when in large numbers the warriors
did not care to wander far from their homes
lest the villages be assaulted in force during
their absence because of this caution it
became necessary to conserve the buffalo
and under no circumstances scare him away
it resulted that they aimed to surround a
small herd of a few hundred and kill every
one they believed that if a survivor
escaped he would communicate his alarm
to other herds nor did they use their
guns in hunting but always the bow and
arrow

  the first pause in our journey was at the
minnetaree village at the mouth of the
knife consisting of half a hundred huts
and called the little village we very
quickly learned there was a great difference
between this and either of the mandan
villages in regard to manners

  the moment we were sighted a mob of
young demons surrounded us hooting and
deriding their elders sat smoking their
miserable tobacco on top of the huge
circular huts and enjoying the spectacle
more troublesome even than the children
were the dogs which swarmed from all
directions they were as vicious as wolves
and much more daring

  miss dearness who had drawn her
capote over her head when we neared the
village gave a cry of alarm and i spurred
forward and brained a brute with the butt
of my gun as he leaped high to pull her from
the saddle this act caused much scowling
and mumbling from the spectators which
i interpreted to be threats flat mouth
leaned low from his saddle and did for
another beast with his ax the mumbling
broke into a sullen roar and the men on the
huts began rising and preparing to descend

  flat mouth pulled out his string of sioux
scalps and waving them above his head
shouted his name and the fact that he had
once lived among the mandans and the
minnetarees then in their own tongue
he chanted his record of coups touching


adventure

a scalp as he narrated the details of each
encounter the men on the huts gathered
to the edge and allowed their feet to hang
down while they listened

  finishing the story of his exploits the
pillager explained how he was serving the
woman with the medicine hair the most
wonderful woman ever on the missouri
whose father was the mightiest of all
traders and who had intended to build a
post among the villages so the indians
could always obtain whatever they wanted
in arms and ammunition he significantly
concluded with saying

  the big white chief will send no traders
where his daughter is met by mad dogs
and screaming children

  then turning to miss dearness he di-
rected her to reveal her hair

  she obeyed andas the indians stared at
her fiery hair those on the ground drew
back and forgot their scowls while those
on the huts stood erect and forgot their
smoking as the pillager rapidly trans-
lated his speech to me i understood their
concern each village was anxious to obtain
all the white mans goods possible and was
extremely jealous of every visit made by
a trader to a neighboring village

  their lack of hospitality was an excellent
excuse for us to save time by pushing on
although they beseeched us to enter their
huts and partake of food and tobacco we
held on steadily through the village and
into the road leading up the knife they
followed us outside the village but we gave
them no heed we followed the road for
about a mile when the pillager halted and
announced that we were opposite the big
minnetaree village he said it consisted
of some hundred and thirty huts but rub
my eyes as i would i could not see it

  then he explained this the last of the
five villages was located a mile back from
the river and because of this fact and the
resulting problem over fuel the warriors
moved into the hills each winter where
they had more circular huts and wood
aplenty we forded the knife with the
water up to our horses bellies and made a
dash for the village

this time we met less of the rude-
ness which had greeted us below
and yet there was no suggestion
of hospitality they were rude in another
way we were ignored they were most

arrogant in their bearing after ordering
a woman to show us to a big hut set apart
for visitors they paid no attention to us
a physical characteristic of all minnetarees
was the large aquiline nose the pillager
assured us we were safe among them but
added that this was the case purely because
they must have arms from traders to protect
themselves from the sioux and they believed
that we were paving the way for permanent
traders the village originally contained
a thousand huts but the deadly small-pox
had whittled it down to its present pro-
portions

  the hut we were shown to was a duplicate
of the one in black cats village except
that it was dug down three feet below the
surface as tn the mandan huts we found
earthen pots and a copper kettle the
kettle it seems was used entirely for
boiling meat why they couldnt cook
meat in the earthenware as they did
their com and beans i do not know some
foolish superstition was behind it of
course i asked the woman about it and
she said the meat would make the earthen
pots crack

  i quickly learned it was unsafe to move
outside the hut unless armed with a club
the first lime i stepped to the door to
survey the scene i was set upon by a huge
dog i kicked myself clear of the brute
and after that i never ventured abroad
without a club in my hand so long as we
remained in the hut we were left by our-
selves the moment we passed through
the door we were surrounded by impish
brats who would go through our clothes
and filch anything they could miss dear-
ness went out with us once but the repulsive
sights and the constant attendance of the
vicious-mannered mob which accompanied
us every step was experience enough for
her

  you and the pillager carry out your
plans she urged after we returned to the
hut but let us start back to the mandan
village before dark

  its a beastly place i admitted pitying
her deeply i almost wish for your sake
we had tried to win back north without
coming here i think we could have
made it

  no we stood no chance the sioux
were too close the assiniboins too many
our lives are safe here but we ought to be
starting for the red river within a day
gentlemen of the north



or two after a pause she asked when
do you think le borgne will come

  not till after we have gone you have
heard of him

  my father spoke of him when we were
on the assiniboin the indians had much
to tell of him but go and finish your busi-
ness so we can be getting away

  the undercurrent of her thoughts was
le borgne that sinister master of the
minnetarees who ruled as an autocrat
an unusual condition of affairs among the
indians i did not care to ask her what she
had heard about the chief it was sure to be
something disquieting i picked up my
club and followed by flat mouth passed
from the hut

  we had a brisk battle with the dogs but
finally put them to rout young bucks
swaggered close glaring murderously at
our success over their pets one was so
bold as to step before the pillager to block
his path or to make him step aside flat
mouth slapped him in the face with his
string of sioux scalps called him a child
and asked how long before he could grow up
and kill a sioux

  the buck maddened beyond self-control
and knowing the warriors were watching
his shame grabbed for his ax flat mouth
smiled evilly and dangled the string before
his face the hand on the ax relaxed i
was using the medicine bag taken from
the war-chief killed in the red lake river
country as a tobacco pouch now i pro-
duced it filled my pipe and through the
pillager advised the young man and his
friend not to bother mighty warriors who
never bothered to slay any but chiefs
carrying the pipe

  the display of scalps and the sight of
the medicine pouch brought the elders to
sharp attention several approached their
bearing very decorous and questioned the
pillager he proudly proclaimed himself
a hero and gave his new name of sioux
killer he declared i came next to him
and said the white woman with the medi-
cine hair was more powerful than both
of us

  the lowering glances continued yet your
exhibit of trophies had made a deep im-
pression and forced their respect their
great chief le borgne would have been
proud to recite the coups the pillager had
recounted harsh commands were given
and the band of children drew back the

young men ceased their insolence and
women clubbed the dogs to the outskirts
of the village

  then le borgnes brother caltahcota
or choke-cherry as the traders knew him
deigned to make himself known and in-
quired minutely into the purpose of our
visit he was pleased with the story i told
through the pillager and said his brother
would be very glad to welcome us but that
we had done wrong in not bringing guns
powder and ball with us as the sioux were
very thick and troublesome around the
village

  the pillager sneered and loudly declared
he would drive the sioux away and double
the length of his string choke-cherry
seemed to accept him at his own estimation
and his respect took on a touch of awe he
insisted we go into his hut and eat

  we followed him and were presented with
bowls of meat that only one word can
describe-putrid even for politeness sake
i could not endure the stench of it let alone
tasting it choke-cherry gobbled at it
voraciously and gave us some dried beans
and corn bruised in a mortar cooked with-
out salt and very tasteless still it could
be swallowed flat mouth was not par-
ticular as to what he ate yet there were
limits to even his indian appetite and
stomach he partook only of the corn and
beans while we were bolting our portions
he assured me that the minnetarees would
kill a buffalo in winter leave it in the snow
and wait until decomposition had set in
before using it for food i could well
believe it

escaping to the free air i asked
choke-cherry when his mighty
brother would lje back he be-
lieved in a few days he was very vague
indicating he knew no more about it than
we did the six cheyenne envoys had
withdrawn a mile north of the village to
await the coming of more of their people
upon their arrival the treaty between them
and the minnetarees would be duly ce-
mented the minnetarees would adopt
a cheyenne youth and many presents
would be placed under the stem while
le borgne was too big a man to abandon
a hunting trip for any purpose except to
follow his own will it was probable he would
return very soon

  with the pillager interpreting i said
h

adventure

  we must go back lo the lower villages to-
night when your brother comes send a
man to us so we may come to him

  he urged that we remain with the
minnetarees indefinitely but i explained
we had certain trade preparations to make
and he finally agreed to inform us when the
chief irrived

  utterly disgusted with the villages
determined to get away where i could feel
clean once more and sensing that it must
be hell for miss dearness i made up my
mind on the spot to make a break north
from the mandan village early the next
morning fear of the sioux would keep
the village indians from pursuing us
while the presence of the cheyennes on
the knife anxious to make peace would
tend to make both sioux and assiniboins
chary about remaining in that neighbor-
hood

  the mandans while peacefully disposed
and much less arrogant than the minne-
tarees were known as dogged fighters
allied with the cheyennes they could carry
a good fight to the sioux and the latter
knew it by striking directly north and
traveling much by night i believed we could
make the big loop of the mouse after
following the mouse a short distance we
would be within the sphere of influence of
the n w company represented by fort
assiniboin and our dangers from hostile
red men would be over nor did i expect
any difficulty in leaving the mandan
village we had come and gone as we
pleased our story was believed and we had
visited the minnetaree village to consult
with le borgnes brother

  leaving choke-cherry - cherry-on-a-
bush was his full name i believe-we re-
turned to the hut and found miss dearness
seated on a robe before the empty firehole
and looking very sad i briefly explained
my purpose and it was worth great risks
to behold the wonderful lighting up of the
blue eyes as she turned them on me

  it will succeed she cried in english
it must oh youve removed a big load
from my heart to be out in the open-to
breathe clean air again-anything but this

  youve seen so much of indian life in
traveling with your father that you must
be prepared to withstand what would shock
an inexperienced white woman i re-
marked

  true she murmured i can force

myself to indifference to much thats re-
pulsive-a make-believe indifference any-
way ive said the indians talked of le
borgne on the assiniboin ive also heard
the h b men describe him in talking with
my father he likes to meet white men
he treats them better than his warriors do
hes shrewd enough to know he must have
arms and he can get them only through
the white traders from the indian stand-
point he is a very great man yes hes
that even by our standards he controls
these villages absolutely and you know how
dearly an indian prizes his personal liberty
le borgne overrides many hard-and-fast
rules of ordinary indian usage what he
wants he takes

  her face went red as she finished then
the color receded leaving her cheeks a
ghastly white and her hand fumbled at
something inside her leather coat probably
her knife

  you understand him as well as the
pillager does i gravely commented per-
haps its best you should

  the truth is always best she simply
replied the fact is there it would be
foolish to hide from it as a calf hides his
head in the grass to escape a hunter

  flat mouth who had listened and picked
up a word here and there now broke in
when i was here last le borgne would
go into a hut and take a warriors wife away
from him the warrior never made any
fight le borgne is a great chief

  his lack of finesse in making the brutal
speech would have angered me more if i did
not believe the girl knew all that he knew
she glanced with a curious little smile and
quietly said-

  well he will never take me

  what nonsense of course not i
cried hotly to hear us one would think
this raw savage was all powerful then
again lets give him credit for having some
sense he wants traders to come here so
he can stand off the sioux is he fool
enough to spoil all the chances for saving
his people from the sioux by turning every
trader against him of course not miss
dearness you havent any cause to worry
she reached out and patted my hand and
murmured-

comforter then she reminded-yet
there is some danger so great that you plan
to return to the mouse without an escort
she had me in all honesty i insisted
gentlemen of the north



our proposed flight was impelled by idle
fears so far as we knew beyond the
general character of le borgne we had
no reason for deducing he would bring down
the wrath of the american government
upon him by stealing a white woman

  tell that to these indians and they
will laugh at you she jeered you cant
make them believe but what they are the
most superior and the most brave people
on earth there may come a time when
your government can control them now
they have no more respect for or fear of
your government than that of china which
they never heard of why they even be-
lieve they outnumber the whites tell
them of big white villages beyond the
mississippi and they will tell you that you
lie ive traveled enough with my father
and have heard enough trade-talk to at
least know that much

  i had to admit the truth of her state-
ments and shifted to the contention that
the chiefs imperative need of guns would
come first in his heart he might laugh
at the united states government as a
shadowy thing but he would never laugh
at the sioux and a powerful trading com-
pany believing we all three represented
the n w company he would be anxious
for us to carry back pleasant reports and
thereby hasten the establishment of a per-
manent post

  and yet you plan to escape at the
earliest opportunity-tomorrow morning if
we can manage it she monotonously re-
minded

  we can wait and see the chief and have
him send an escort with us i boldly
declared

  with a little shudder she protested

  no no we must start tomorrow
instinct tells me we must do so i only
wish we could start now i tell you i am
afraid and im not bothered with any silly
imagination i feel as if something were
about to happen

  for heavens sake dont let our friend
here know that or hell sit down and sing
his death song waiting for some one to
club him to death youre big medicine
to him so long as he can believe that
he can do much

  medicine hair big medicine mur-
mured flat mouth catching at the familiar
words although puzzled bv the rest of our
talk

  she raised her head and stared at us
both haughtily the effect at once regis-
tered on the pillager smoothing out her
wonderful hair she softly sounded the
ululating call that carried the whispering
of the wind and the prattling of shallow
rivers the chief stood very straight his
head tipped back his nostrils distended

  there was a warriors ambition in his
small eyes if he had been disturbed by
her downcast mien he was now restored
to all his old-time strutting complacency
he was the chief of the pillager chippewas
the minnetarces were low dogs who lived
cooped up in a village and ate stinking
meat the hand that struck against his
robe where hung his scalps was itching for
more bloody work then the door of the
hut swung open and choke-cherry stood
before us blinking at the girl

he was wearing a gorgeous head-
gear made from a turkey-cocks
tail and he seemed much puffed
up with his own importance for a few
moments he forgot his errand and stared
at miss dearness and her lustrous hair
with an effort he recalled his business and
in a loud voice began reciting as he
talked he pounded his chest and glanced
from me to the girl and then to the im-
passive pillager when he had finished
the pillager explained that the messenger
sent to inform le borgne of the cheyennes
presence at the village had found the great
chief a short distance up the knife but
being a great chief it did not please his
fancy to quit the hunt even for making
the peace treaty accordingly he had sent
the messenger back with directions for his
brother the renowned and redoubtable
choke-cherry to treat with the cheyennes
and to adopt the cheyenne youth

  these delegated powers had swollen
choke-cherrys conceit almost to the ex-
ploding point out of five brothers to
le borgne he had been picked he had
sent word to the cheyenne camp that he
was coming to act for his illustrious brother
and to give more tone to the cere-
mony he desired his new friends to be
present

  miss dearness face remained cold
and proud but her soul was on her lips
when she whispered to me

  thank god he isnt coming you two
go and i will wait here


adventure

  on being informed of our decision choke-
cherry violently objected he needed the
medicine of her hair he said never had
the cheyennes seen such hair her at-
tendance was absolutely necessary he
insisted

  youd better come i urged after flat
mouth had interpreted it will give
us better standing with them we can
ride directly from the ceremony to the
lower village

  if you think best she surrendered
rising and gathering up her capote

  choke-cherry had had small chance to
wear the purple i took it and his dignity
and conceit were terrific as choke-cherry
the warriors would have laughed at him
as the mouth-piece of his illustrious brother
his orders were obeyed with great celerity
our horses were brought to the hut and
the buck who acted as hostler did not even
pause to beg for the usual piece of trade
tobacco we found the village humming
with unusual activity and choke-cherry
every few rods halted his pony and hoarsely
harangued the people these speeches
had no point i deduced from flat mouths
grim smile of contempt but they killed the
time which i believed to be precious

  finally we were ready and rode beside
choke-cherry at the head of two hundred
or more mounted warriors they had
decorated their ponies with white and red
earth some showing white or red hand-
prints to advertise that their riders had
grappled bare-handed with an enemy
others were marked with stripes

  the riders too were painted but they
would have been very ferocious to be-
hold even without any coloring for the
majority of them showed wide welts in the
flesh produced by pushing an arrow-head
along under the skin many had several
of these hideous ridges running from the
hand to the shoulder and then down on
the chest wherelhey ended in a series of
circles nearly all had scalps hanging
from their bridles or from the handles of
their axes and spears the women also
mounted brought up the rear these
were uniformly tattooed with broad lines
from the nose to the cars and from the
comers of the mouth down to the throat

  as we galloped along behind choke-
cherry flat mouth festooned his scalps
down the front of his robe while i hung
the sioux medicine pouch on my breast

several groups of young men now swung
in ahead of us riding ten abreast and
chanting their war-songs and sounding
their rattles choke-cherry produced the
ceremonial pipe from a case carried across
his saddle and held it high in one hand so
that it could not touch his horse

  now while we went in superior numbers
to sign a peace pact yet we moved in a
compact body as if fearing an attack
nor was this because of any ceremony
we were afraid of an attack word was
given for the young men to cease racing
their ponies and stay close with the main
body and more than one of the gun-
bearers saw that his piece was properly
primed and slipped an extra ball into his
mouth

  when within about a quarter of a mile
of the cheyenne camp a score of warriors
came racing out to meet us on horse-flesh
that was far superior to anything the
minnetarees owned their animals heads
were cunningly concealed in masks repre-
senting buffalo and red deer heads the
riders were all young men and they rode
up to us shook hands and cried out greet-
ings in their own language

  on beholding miss dearness they seemed
strangely affected and lost much of their
noisy manner flat mouth and his decora-
tions also impressed them although he
wore none of the finery the minnetarees
were displaying but he had the proof of
having been at hand-grips with the sioux

  as they galloped back to their camp they
repeatedly turned to gaze at us choke-
cherry took all this to his own credit but
i knew it was the girl and her vivid hair
that attracted these backward glances
she too was moved by the stirring spec-
tacle and her blue eyes flashed and sparkled
and roamed back and forth to take in all
the details of the lively panorama for
the moment she was forgetting the filth
and the annoyance and was beholding only
the barbaric grace of the riders and the
pictorial rioting of colors

  choke-cherry the old wind-bag now
halted the long line and rode from front
to rear pausing every rod to spout and roar
his orders determined to live his brief
authority to the limit he lectured them
on the virtue of keeping their finery un-
soiled so as to do honor to their tribe he
exhorted them to carry themselves care-
fully so as to give no offense and spoil the
gentlemen of the north



peace he severely scolded a band of
mandans who rode at one side and out of
line flat mouth said the mandans had to
stand much overbearing conduct from
their allies but added that aside from the
borgne no minnetaree ventured beyond
certain limits

  because of choke-cherrys love for
speech-making i feared we would never
make the camp and have the ceremony
of adoption done with but fortunately a
great war-chief of the cheyennes now
dashed out to meet us on a white stallion
and put an end to our leaders mouthing
this man was a magnificent specimen he
wore a blue coat procured in trade with
the spaniards through some of the southern
tribes and a gaily striped blanket he
all but rode us down and had his horses
hoofs pawing the air over my head in a most
disconcerting manner

  he shook hands with me and miss
dearness at whom he stared overlong
and with the pillager choke-cherry who
was a few hundred feet behind us now
galloped up and fussily took over the
management of the situation the chief
shook hands with him cordially but his gaze
alternated between the girls hair and the
stern cold face of the pillager with his wealth
of sioux hair the business of handshaking
done with he fell back and a large number
of his men rode forward and mingled with
the minnetarees and mandans shaking
hands and shouting a welcome

at a signal from their chief the
cheyennes fell into long lines with a
military precision and galloped to
their camp we followed at a sedate pace
when we arrived the chief and several
of the older men rode back and forth
through the camp reminding their people
that the minnetarees were their friends
that they were to be fed and protected
from thieves there were a hundred
leather tents in the camp white as snow
and set in a horseshoe with the opening
toward the north the speech of the
cheyennes is much more pleasing to the
ear than that of the mandans or minne-
tarees and reminded me much of our
northern crees

  thus far all had gone smoothly then
like a bolt a band of cheyennes darted
from their camp and rode like mad along
our back trail at first i supposed this

to be one of their graceiul maneuvers
but quickly perceived by choke-cherrys
excitement that something unusual was up
he yelped to his warriors and two-score
wheeled their horses and started on a
course parallel to that of the cheyennes

  i rode up a low hill to discover the trouble
and beheld two horsemen desperately
riding to meet the minnetarees before the
cheyennes could get to them behind me
both the cheyenne camp and the body of
minnetarees were in a boiling commotion
the women accompanying our party were
hurriedly getting the horses to the rear
choke-cherry was bleating madly flat
mouth and miss dearness galloped to
join me

  be ready we may have to ride fast
from here if we do we will strike for the
mouse without going back to the mandan
village said the pillager

  i asked for an explanation he pointed
to the two horsemen now inside the double
line of minnetarees i looked and recog-
nized the head-dress of buffalo horns

  assiniboins i cried why dont the
minnetarees kill them

  they came into the village they can
not be harmed the cheyennes are their
deadly enemies knowing the minnetarees
are stronger today than the cheyennes
they foolishly followed them out here
the cheyennes want to kill them the
minnetarees say they shall not be hurt
instead of peace we may have a battle if
that happens we will ride for it

  now the minnetarees were returning
the two assiniboins in their midst the
cheyennes shouted furiously and gesticu-
lated with their weapons as they demanded
the surrender of the newcomers choke-
cherry rode up to the cheyenne chief and
asked him to call his young men back the
chief offered ten of his best horses for the
assiniboins and there was no logical
reason-the dictates of humanity aside
of which the minnetarees knew nothing-
why the intruders should not ha-e been
given up but according to the indian
reasoning the two were safe once they
entered the village and so long as they
remained in the village as almost all
the village had gone to visit the cheyennes
the assiniboins followed our road and were
held to be theoretically still in the village
and entitled to protection

  it was a curious example of the power
n

adventure

of custom the minnetarees were deter-
mined to protect the two hostile indians
even if it cost them the friendship of the
cheyennes the men were finally brought
well within our lines thrust into a small tent
and told to keep out of sight next fol-
lowed an hour of vehement speech-making
at last the cheyennes said they would
get their chance later choke-cherry was
nervous and uneasy and at once began
preparing for the ceremony

  miss dearness became so deeply inter-
ested in the assiniboins that i made some
comment upon it she replied

  they were with those who drove us
down here they are spies they came
to learn if we were here and when we are
likely to go their main body is in hiding
somewhere near

  they must not go back to tell what
theyve learned i said

  oh not murder she protested
  self-defense i grimly qualified

  i turned to the pillager and found him
perfectly composed he said he had known
the moment he beheld the two that their
errand on the knife concerned us

   i said to the girl

  its very simple ill get word to the
cheyennes to watch the two and bag them
if they leave the village flat mouth shall
tell them as he talks the sign language
but the war-party outside waiting to
catch us she murmured

flat mouth shall tell of that too the
cheyennes shall go and drive them away
i began to feel rather obliged to the two
fellows for coming in and revealing the un-
suspected danger

  so far as i could observe the wrangling
over the assiniboins terminated without
any obvious gain made by either side except
that the minnetarees kept the two indians
alive with the dissension smoothed away
next came the ceremony of completing the
treaty the terms were simple and ac-
cepted by both tribes the alliance was
to wage war on the sioux and their allies
choke-cherry by formally adopting a chey-
enne youth as his son would be creating
binding ties between the tribes the
cheyennes however were reluctant to
proceed with the business

  flat mouth got hold of a mandan and
learned the cheyennes were angry that
le borgne did not consider the treaty of
enough importance to be present it had

only needed the incident of the assiniboins
to bring this resentment to the surface
the medicine-tent was not up nor had they
formed a smaller ceremonial horseshoe of
the white leather tents after much argu-
ing and oratory the medicine tent was
finally erected

  choke-cherry made a long-winded speech
and called to him two crows a minne-
taree chief and gave to him the long pipe-
stem he had so carefully guarded from
being profaned by touching his horse
this stem was adorned with feathers and
two crows in accepting it danced gro-
tesquely back and forth while two young
minnetarees beat on a drum and rattled
antelope hoofs together

  after a certain amount of prancing
came the ceremonial visit to the tent of the
cheyenne who was to be adopted two
crows went ahead with his thudding dance
step and behind him danced the men with
the drum and the hoofs we followed
with choke-cherry at choke-cherrys
command three horses were brought along
several pegs were pulled out and the flaps
of the tent drawn back so that the horses
could be led inside the three halters were
placed in the hands of a very sullen looking
young man who was seated opposite the
entrance two crows danced up and
offered him the sacred stem to the con-
sternation of choke-cherry the stem was
haughtily waved aside choke-cherry tried
to reason with him but he would not come
out of his sulks

the situation was growing serious
flat mouth gained the side of the
cheyenne war-chief who was sar-
donically watching choke-cherrys em-
barrassment and talked rapidly with one
hand masked by his robe only the chief
could read his talk and as he compre-
hended his eyes darted fire striding to
the young man he spoke in his ear whereat
the stem was accepted choke-cherry and
two crows now took him by the arms and
led him to the medicine-tent and seated
him beside some new red strouds-coarse
blankets choke-cherry sat on his right
and two crows on his left the musicians
continued their efforts and a figure danced
in with the head of a buffalo on his shoul-
ders the nostrils and mouth of which were
stuffed with dried grass he placed the
gentlemen of the north



skull of a bull on the ground opposite the
cheyenne

  now came the gift-making and again the
cheyennes held back some of the minne-
tarees brought ammunition and placed it
on the strouds and the cheyenne held the
stem over it two crows rose and ad-
dressed the cheyennes urging them to
bring something to put under the stem
after much waiting three warriors brought
in a few robes and some dressed leather
and piled them on the ammunition this
encouraged the minnetarees and they gave
three guns the cheyennes came back
with three poor ponies choke-cherry
growled and grunted in great wrath and
his followers brought two more guns and
some corn and beans this resulted in
another sore-backed nag from the visitors

  then did choke-cherry explode and
demand what the cheyennes meant by
putting worthless creatures under the stem
when the minnetarees were giving good
guns and powder and ball the cheyennes
replied they would bring good horses when
more guns were put under the stem

  choke-cherry forgot diplomacy and
roundly accused the cheyennes of plotting
to induce the minnetarees to give up their
weapons so that they might be helpless
before an attack this accusation of
treachery was immediately followed by
the cheyennes hurrying back to the tents
we waited thinking they were gone to
bring more ponies then the warriors
outside the medicine tent began calling
out loudly and we ran after choke-cherry
and two crows and beheld the cheyennes
striking their tents and preparing to
ride off

  the young man who was to have been
adopted galloped by us riding one of the
gift nags leading the others and carrying
the guns and ammunition more than one
bow was drawn taut as he flew by but
choke-cherry although convulsed with
rage knew better than to let war come
while his brother was absent and his stern
commands liberally mixed with mention
of his brothers name saved the young
mans life

  the cheyennes rode off in a body the
peace treaty had fallen through because
of the assiniboins yet the minnetarees
did not seem to attribute any blame to
them and treated them kindly as we rode
back to the village before arriving at

the huts choke-cherry turned toward the
river a mile away on reaching it he
directed two crows to bring a white
buffalo hide flat mouth explained to me
and the girl that choke-cherry feared he
had handled the peace treaty badly and
anticipated his brothers anger to guard
against this he now proposed to sacrifice
a precious white robe such a hide as
i have remarked before is the most highly
valued by the minnetarees of all their
possessions i could understand how the
chiefs brother was considerably worked up

  two crows came galloping back not with
a whole hide for that was a liberality that
even the gods had no right to expect but a
long strip this seemed to answer per-
fectly however and was soon placed in a
deep hole in the river and weighted down
with rocks choke-cherry then made a
long speech in which he said he knew what
was to blame for the cheyennes behavior
which he promised to duly report to his
brother having done all he could to
placate his gods he morosely led the way
home

  you talked with the cheyenne chief
i murmured to flat mouth

  he is red arrow a brave warrior he
will wait three days to go with us to the
mouse

  why is he willing to do that i curi-
ously asked

  he knows i will pay him he will make
a good trade was the evasive answer

   choke-cherry halted at the first hut and
as we rode up he glared at me viciously
and shouted something the pillager in-
terpreted-

  i know what stopped me from making
peace with the cheyennes

  what was it i asked

  bad medicine

  what was the medicine i knew
what he would say before he spoke

  the hair of the white woman he
grunted switching his malignant gaze to
miss dearness

  i warmly replied he was a fool and some
other things and that no treaty would be
made with the minnetarees when they took
the assiniboin snakes along with them

  my brother is a very wise man we
shall see he replied as he rode away

   the girl had interpreted his look and had
heard flat mouths chippewa translation
and her hand was cold as ice as she rode


adventure

closer and placed it on mine and whis-
pered-

  it all comes back-my fear

  dont you worry a bit i soothed
well get out of here flying inside of twelve
hours

  in my heart however a deadly chill was
growing

  it was now dusk and after leaving our
ponies at the corral i escorted miss dear-
ness to the hut and lighted some bark in
the fire-hole to drive away the gloom
then i told her that we had better remain
where we were until morning as the ride
down the river would be dangerous sur-
rounding the village were innumerable pits
eight feet or more deep which the women
filled with corn and beans each fall these
were all open and to get clear of the place
at night was to risk a broken leg or neck

  but we must get away tonight she
fiercely insisted any danger but this
she waved her hand to encompass the
whole village you heard what he said
about my medicine spoiling the treaty i
care nothing for that but there is another
danger oh mr franklin youve been
very good and patient with me-but get me
out of here tonight

  very well well go tonight but we cant
return to the mandans we must risk
crossing the missouri at the mouth of the
knife and striking northeast if we waited
until tomorrow and started from the
mandans we might find a band of chey-
ennes waiting to act as escort the chief
told the pillager he would see us to the
mouse

  id rather start from here tonight and
travel alone than wait any longer she
said perhaps flat mouth could swing to
one side and pick up the cheyennes if
not then a ride for it and a clean quick
death at the worst

  there must be no talk of death i re-
buked well go and get through i was
only thinking of the difficulties in getting
the horses across the missouri but with a
bull-boat we ought to be able to tow them
over one at a time rest easy while i go
and find the pillager and arrange for him
to get the horses from the corral

  i had passed through the door closed it
and had heard the heavy bar drop across it
when a terrific screech rang out a few huts
away and in the direction of the river
the cry was caught up and repeated i

stood undecided my thumb resting on the
hammer of my gun the door opened back
of me and she was beside me a hand resting
on my shoulder her head tilted as she
sought to read my face in the darkness
the village was now in an uproar

  the cheyennes must be attacking in
force i muttered

  its something very serious she whis-
pered do you think you can manage to
get the horses up here

  stay inside let no one in i said
stepping out and blundering between the
huts where the path in places was only a
foot in width

i passed between two huts and
bumped into an indian his hands
struck my chest to push me aside
then the pillagers voice was whispering-
so it is you i knew the cloth

  what is the trouble youve been
running

  the last deduction was not because his
breathing was beyond normal but because
in clutching his wrists i felt his pulse
racing

  the assiniboin spies will not go back
to tell what they saw here he hissed in
my ear

  good god youve killed them
i muttered

  killed both i promised the cheyenne
chief their scalps if he would give us war-
riors to go with us to the mouse i told
you he would make a good trade

  but theyll be after you i softly
cried

  choke-cherry thinks the cheyennes
crept in and did it

  it wont do for you to be seen it might
make them suspicious dont tell the white
woman stand in front of the hut i will
bring up the horses we must cross the
missouri at the mouth of the knife and ride
for it

  the cheyennes will be waiting near the
mandan village he protested

  and its impossible to go down the river
we would lose too much time if the
minnetarees chase us they will take that
direction

  ho eshkebugecoshe chief of the
pillager chippewas needs no help in saving
the white woman except the white womans
medicine

  he thumped his breast and might have
gentlemen of the north



broken into song if i had not quieted him

  i set off making my way toward the
center of the pandemonium which seemed
to focus around the corral lights were
now springing up in the open places the
naked children dancing and piling on fuel
and looking like so many devils whelps

  before i reached the corral the village
was well illumined i met choke-cherry
who bawled out something i could not have
understood even if i knew his language
but as he carried a gun and had his mouth
stuffed with balls i assumed he was ex-
pecting an attack from the cheyennes
he caught my arm and led me to the door
of a hut and ordered the mob to stand
one side as the command was obeyed
i looked down a narrow lane of humanity
and beheld the two assiniboins they
had been killed with a knife and both were
scalped

  i slashed my lingers across my wrist
the sign for the cheyennes and he nodded
he stopped to harangue the crowd and i
worked clear of the shambles and hurried
on to the corral

  i reached the corral and was startled to
behold a line of mounted men riding down
a slight rise and toward me being well
within the light of the many fires al-
though they were continually descending
the rise the head of the line never reached
the corral i watched for a minute
greatly puzzled then a stentorian voice
rose with such tremendous volume as to
carry a great distance it was repeated
several times and was answered from the
center of the village in another moment
several indians came running by the corral

one of them swinging a torch i recognized
choke-cherry and the pillager in the group

  i called out to him and i knew he heard
me yet he kept on with the others to find
the man with the loud voice knowing
he would return when he had finished his
errand i proceeded to pick out our animals
as i led them out of the enclosure a warrior
caught my arm and pointed interrogatively
at the nags i pointed out toward the
open plain and then made the sign for
cheyenne and indicated i was taking the
horses into a hut he nodded and hurried
on i started to lead them away and a
hand fell on my shoulder and the pillager
was wrenching the halter ropes from my
hands and hurriedly driving the ponies back
into the corral

  why do you do that i demanded

  bad medicine at work he gloomily
answered le borgne comes back from
the hunt did you not hear his voice
when he heard the noise in the village he
knew something was wrong and has thrown
a hundred of his hunters around the village
with orders to shoot any one trying to leave
it we must stay

  without a word i followed him back
through the excited throngs some per-
verse agency seemed to be thwarting us
something of the girls strange fear began
to assail me it was not le borgne for a
ball from my double-barrel would nicely
eliminate him it was rather that the
whole village stood for ruthless and brutal
domination through physical strength
when i came to the hut tapped on the
door and gave my name i was confront-
ing the hardest task i had ever encountered

                                  to be concluded
author ot the snake and the sloth

i would not attack that spider again
senhor if i were you you have seen
for yourself that you can not hit him
no matter how quickly you strike he
is inches away when the blow falls

  those huge bird-killing spiders all are
incredibly swift i have heard that not
even a bullet is fast enough to kill one-
that at the flash of the gun he jumps so
quickly that the whole seven inches of him
is out of danger when the shot strikes
whether that be true or not i know you
will never hit him with your fist you will
only tire yourself out besides he may
grow angry and attack you in return
his fangs are half an inch long senhor and
he is full of poison it js not wise to risk
his springing at yju

  this is an odd place to find such a mon-
ster-here in the middle of the broad
amazon on a steamer outward bound
toward the atlantic yet strange creatures
sometimes come aboard these river-boats
while they are tied up at the bank some
of them are harmless and some are deadly
and not all of the deadly things are found
on the outgoing steamers nor are they
all bred here in the jungle

  sometimes they come up the river from
the outside and are the more deadly because
they are human the memory of one of
them came into my mind just now while i
watched that great spider leaping aside
from your blows he too was called
the spider that man though his name
was schwartz

  what is that you say that schwarz
means black that is very droll senhor
for the spider was black black of hair

black of beard black of eye he was-yes
and black of heart too though at first we
did not know that we called him spider
because he looked like one his little
eyes were set close together with a sort of
spidery look in them his body was small
and bunchy while his arms were long and
thin and covered with black hair his legs
were short and crooked yet he could run
amazingly fast on those little legs that
made him seen all the more like a spider
and later he made himself a spiders lair-
and came to a spiders end

  an up-river boat brought him to us one
day and with him a small brown bag and
a rifle he had no letters to coronel
nunes owner of the great rubber estate
where i worked nor anything else to show
who he was or whence he had come the
coronel however received him with the
courtesy he shows to all who come to him
and when this man told him he had had
another bag containing letters of intro-
duction and other things of value but that
it had been stolen from him on the boat
the coronel believed him-or at any rate
seemed to for theft is a tiling that may
happen to any man in almost any place

  schwartz boldly-made himself at home
there at the headquarters and talked
vaguely about looking over the country
for the people he said he represented he
went out in ihe jungle with us men and saw
all he could see always he carried two
weapons-the rifle and a pistol

  it may be a foolish fancy senhores
but i have sometimes thought that a man
may be judged by his weapons and not
only the man himself but the country
the spider



whence he comes-for a man usually
carries the weapons made in his own land
now you two americans i have noticed
carry with you that flat pistol made by the
senhor colt which you say was used by
your army in the war in europe there
is about it a square solid look which fits
well with the things i have observed about
you and with what i have heard about
your great country also the shape of
that pistol is such that it seems to say-

  i do not seek trouble with any man
but if any man wants it-i am ready

  your winchesters too have something
of that same air of solid readiness

  the guns of the spider had a much
different appearance the pistol looked
venomous it leaned forward from the
ugly butt to the thin muzzle as if always
eager to kill it reminded me of a striking
snake the name of it he once told me
was a loo-let me see-ah yes that is it
senhor-a luger the rifle too looked
wicked but i can not remember its name
it does not matter but that pistol and
the look of the spidery man who carried it
were such that when he was following
behind me in the bush i got a cold feeling
between my shoulder-blades as if death
were about to strike me in the back

  my mates too said that they had the
same feeling when he was behind them
yet he gave us no real cause for it he did
not bluster nor threaten us by word or act
indeed he was very quiet he had the
spiders way of remaining still in one place
for a long time watching everything and
making no move it might be our work
that he watched or it might be something
in the jungle that aroused his interest but
whatever it was you felt that when he
stopped looking at it he had seen everything
about it and remembered it all

  one thing that amused us was his habit
of watching other spiders-real spiders of
the bush which we often met no matter
what sort of spider it might lie he would
study it and learn its ways and how
it lived and got its prey when he did
this we would wink at one another and
laugh behind our hands and one of my
mates named pedro-a tall handsome
young fellowr who was very droll-would
pretend to pounce on something and then
say under his breath

   take care little spider the big spider
will eat you

  it seemed very funny to us at the time
but later on things came about which made
it not funny at all

  after he had been among us for some
time another boat came it brought us
welcome guests the coroncls daughter who
had journeyed all the way from rio to
visit him and her cousin a gentleman of
rio senhor affonso da fonseca every
year the senhorita flora made this long
trip from the great city where she was
receiving the finest education the coronets
wealth could give her to see her lonely old
father and though he would never allow
her to remain very long lest she become ill
from the climate or meet some mischance
from snakes or other things we all knew
that he looked forward to these short visits
of hers as the brightest days of all the
year

  we knew too that he planned eventually
to make his own home again in rio where
he had lived until his wife died and we
knew also that senhor alfonso who was
somewhat older than the senhorita had a
deeper feeling for her than that of a cousin
and that though he accompanied her
partly because he was interested in our
rubber country and partly because he felt
it his duty to protect her on the long jour-
ney he came more for the pleasure of being
with her we were glad of this jor she
was a handsome gracious girl-the true
daughter of her father-while the senhor
was every inch a man and would make her
a fine husband the coronet himself ap-
proved the match

       now it happened just at this time
that i met with a rather bad acci-
dent in the bush-my right leg was
cut by a nuichete-and so i had to go back
to headquarters to let the injury heal
my old coronet had a very friendly feeling
for me because in past days i had done
some dangerous things for him which many
men would not have done so while i was
recovering from my hurt he often had me
come to the house and sit and talk to him
and being there i saw a number of
things

  for one thing i noticed that the spider
stopped going into the jungle so much
he stayed around the headquarters sitting
quiet for hours in that spidery way of his
and watching the senhorita or senhor
affonso sometimes he talked in his


adventure

throaty foreign way and the others an-
swered him with all politeness but i could
see that none of them liked him

  the coronel was displeased at the way
the spiders eyes followed his daughter and
the girl herself avoided him senhor af-
fonso though was much interested some-
times by the black-bearded mans talk of
things he had studied in the jungle and
now and then he went out with him to see
those things for himself at such times
i always felt uneasy and senhorita flora
too kept watching anxiously until they
returned

  mind you senhores the spider never had
done anything to make us distrust him
but dark crimes can easily be committed
when two men are alone in the bush and
we knew that senhor affonso was wealthy
and that no doubt he had a tempting sum
of milreis with him and as i have said
there was that about the spider which made
one feel that it would not be well to trust
him too far so i always felt relieved
when the rio gentleman came back un-
harmed and i knew the senhorita did also
though she never spoke of what was in her
mind

  then one day a man of ours reported
seeing a splendid black jaguar in the forest
and senhor affonso and the spider went to
hunt it they made the longest trip they
had yet taken for they were gone tfto days
this time we were more at ease about them
however for by the coronels order two of
our men went with them-the man who
had seen the jaguar and another who was a
good hunter

  not long after they departedanother boat
came it was the one which had brought
the spider to us my leg was better now
though still stiff and i limped down to
watch the unloading of the  supplies as
i started the coronel asked me to request
the captain to come up for a moment i
did so and thought no more of it after
the boat went though i noticed that the
coronel seem disturbed at times his eyes
would snap angrily and then he would walk
up and down his face wrinkled in thought
i asked no questions of course but after
the spider and senhor affonso returned
i soon learned what was the matter

  they had found the jaguar and brought
with them his great glossy hide which
senhor affonso proudly showed to the girl
and her father

  it shall go back to rio with us he said
looking at flora and there was that in his
face which added and some day beloved
it shall be in our home

  she smiled and blushed a little dropping
her eyes

  i do not know why i did it but i glanced
at the spider to see if he wat-ched this
i saw he did and that a nasty expression
crossed his face the coronel saw this too
and his mouth tightened when the others
started into the house he said-

  senhor schwartz i would speak with
you

  i turned to go away but as i have said
my leg was stiff and i had to walk slowly-
and i will admit that i did not try very
hard to hasten for i knew the coronel was
about to say something worth hearing
before i had gone far the old gentleman
spoke

  senhor you have now made me quite
a long visit i have greatly enjoyed your
companionship and i am grieved that in
this poor home of mine i have been unable
to offer you better entertainment i trust
however that the little i could do to show
you the workings of the estate has been
of some assistance to you and that on your
departure you will carry with you many
pleasant memories

  the spider said nothing so the corond
added-

  it is with sorrow that i learn that you
are to leave us on the next boat

  after a pause the spider said

  ya i see it is because i lost that bag
mit my papers

  pardon senhor said the coronel but
the aurora was here yesterday and as you
are my guest i asked the captain if any
trace of your black bag of which you told
me had been found he told me senhor
that you had no black bag whatever-only
the brown one which you brought here
and that nothing had been taken from you
no doubt there is some mistake yet i
have known this captain for years and i
know him to be honest and truthful
there was another pause just as i
passed out of hearing the spider said-

  he is a-liar but i will go

  i heard him walk into the house

  as no boat was expected for a time
things went on as before i said nothing
of what i had overheard and i know the
coronel did not tell the others for he is the
the spider



very soul of hospitality and it had cost him
an unpleasant struggle to do what he had
to do the spider went out into the bush
a few times alone and returned and talked
of various things he had seen then one
morning he and senhor affonso went out
together to look at something or other
this black-hearted man said he had found

  i watched them go and i became more
uneasy than ever before i wanted to
follow but my leg was not yet good enough
to let me travel easily and noiselessly so
i looked about and my eye fell on young
pedro the droll fellow who used to pretend
to devour spiders i beckoned to him and
whispered to him to follow the pair and
keep out of sight he did so at once

time passed and a sort of drowsi-
ness had crept upon me when
there came a sound-a sound like
a shot some distance away and muffled
by the bush i sprang awake and listened
suddenly i remembered that pedro had
not taken his rifle-only the machete he
always carried at his belt senhor affonso
though had a gun with him and he might
be shooting at some animal

  before long there came two other shots
these were nearer than the first and sounded
like the spiteful crack of the luger i got
up and went to my quarters to get my rifle
senhorita flora who had heard the shots
too come out and called to me-
lourenfo what is it

  but i made no answer and went on as
fast as a lame man could

  i was just coming out with the gun when
floras name was called from the edge of
the forest there stood the spider

  come quickly senhorita  he said
affonso has met with an accident

  she started running toward him i
called-

  do not go senhorita wait

  but she kept on and i began to run too
then the spider stopped us both he
fired at me

  the bullet missed me so narrowly that
i felt it pass my face i dodged my
clumsy stiff leg twisted and i fell sprawling
when i looked up the girl had whirled and
was running back to the house

  the spider who thought he had killed
me was running after her with all his
spidery speed my rifle had fallen from
my hand and while i was getting it he

caught her he dragged her back toward
the jungle she struggled to escape and
he struck her so hard that he dazed her
then he picked her up and ran but i had
my rifle now

  i fired from where i lay aiming low
trying to hit his crooked legs and so avoid
injuring flora but i shot hurriedly and
missed him still my shooting stopped
him for when he saw i was alive he swung
the girl toward me and using her as a
shield fired at me again

  as you perhaps know a man lying down
is hard to hit but his bullet ripped across
my shoulders and tore the shirt from my
back and burned my skin i could not
shoot again without striking the senhorita
so i did not try

  then came a burst of fire from the house
where the coronel had seized weapons
now he came bounding out like a jaguar
with a pistol in each hand spitting flame
and lead as he ran somewhere behind
me too a rifle barked fired by some man
about the place

  of course both the coronel and the work-
man shot high lest they kill flora but
the spider thinking only of himself had
no time to realize this finding himself
under fire from two directions and hearing
yells of rage as other men ran for their
guns he suddenly dropped the girl and ran
diving into the bush

  i shot at him again as he fled but again
i missed then we all hastened to flora
whom the coronel had caught up in his
arms for the moment we forgot every-
thing but her then still stunned by the
blow of the spider she moaned-
affonso

  we all started and looked at one another
and i said-

  yes senhor affonso must have been
shot-and pedro too

  i explained how i had sent pedro to
follow the coronel snapped

  go men and find them and find
that-that schwartz too

  we growled the spider would not
come back alive if we found him but we
did not find him for he had vanished we
pressed on to find our own people i could
not keep up with the others but i was not
far behind when they met pedro he
came staggering down an old estrada his
face twisted with pain and he bore the
body of senhor affonso
b

adventure

  at first we believed that body to be dead
for it hung limp and there were two bullet-
holes in it but while we were cutting down
branches to make a litter senhor alfonso
stirred and moaned pedro cried out joy-
ously

  he lives the senhor lives

  then he dropped did pedro fainting
from loss of blood for he too had been
shot by the spider and his wound was bad
near the shoulder so now we had two
men to carry home

  as i learned later this was what had
happened

  the spider had told senhor affonso he
had found a trap-door spiders nest which
was quite the most wonderful thing he
had ever seen and the senhor greatly
interested went with him into a place
where no men were working there the
spider pointed to a hole at the base of a
large tree with thick spider-webbing across
it and said that was it

  if the city gentleman had been better
acquainted with spiders he would have
known that no trap-door spider would
ever make such a nest but that it would
be concealed so that it could not be seen
at all but he went up to it and then
the man schwartz said-

  look closely affonso and see how a
spider acts when he is cornered

  then he shot him in the back

  the only thing that saved the senhor was
that even as he bent to look he sensed
something treacherous in the spiders
words and turned to see his face the
bullet struck him before he had turned
half-way but he had twisted so far that
instead of going into his heart it went
through him sidewise and came out under
his right arm the shock threw him for-
ward and his head struck hard against
the tree knocking him senseless

  the spider thinking him dead swiftly
robbed him of every thing valuable-though
he did not get so much as he probably ex-
pected for the senhor had put most of his
money in the coronels safe soon after his
arrival then he dashed back to carry
off the handsome senhorita flora but on
the way he met pedro

  pedro not wishing the pair to know he
was there had followed at some distance
and though he heard the shot he did not
see the shooting and could not be sure of
what it meant so with his machete ready

he sought to stop the spider and question
him without a word the spider shot him
too firing twice the first bullet knocked
him down in the thick bush and the second
missed when he struggled up again the
spider was gone since the first thing
to do was to find senhor affonso he went
and found him

for some time it seemed that
both pedro and the senhor would die
but both were strong and at last
they recovered while they lay there we
hunted the spider but found nothing at all
he had disappeared as if he never had
been there it was during this time too
that we learned what he meant by his
double-tongued advice to senhor affonso
to see what a cornered spider would do
for there came a boat and with it two quiet
common-looking men who talked with the
coronel and went out into the bush with
our men they finally left without telling
their business to any one except the coronel
when they had gone we learned with
surprize that they were police we also
found that they sought the spider and
that he was wanted in para for murder
and at manaos for-worse than murder

  so you see that though he could not
know the law was so close behind him he
did know he could not go back down the
river on the next boat he had reached
the last place where he could live among
men and now there was no place left for
him but the jungle

  my leg was well long before the senhor
and pedro were and i went back to work
i heard though that senhor affonso
vowed he would stay there until he had
hunted down the man who had shot him
and assailed the lady flora if it took the
rest of his life

  the senhorita was even more bitter
against that man than affonso himself-
not so much because he had attacked her
as because he had nearly killed her sweet-
heart that is the way of women yet
she pleaded with him not to seek the
spider as he might be killed in doing so
the coronel too pointed out that he was
city-bred and not fitted for man-hunting
in such terrible country as ours that the
spider must have perished in the jungle
and that even the police had abandoned
the idea of looking for him pedro for
whom the senhor now had much affection
the spider



also urged him to change his mind and said

  leave him to me senhor he is mine
as well as yours and i know the forest
far better than you if ever i find him
he dies

  and so he was dissuaded and finally
he and flora went back to rio

we had long given up the spider
as dead for he had not much
ammunition and no way of getting
more thus his weapons would soon
become useless and then he could kill no
game to eat we had decided he was dead
i say when strange things began to occur
the first of these was the disappearance of
custodio barros

  we were working far out from head-
quarters at the time in new rubber land
and we needed more supplies custodio
was sent down the river in his canoe to get
them a long time went by and he did
not return

  then we sent another man before he
had gone far he met two boats coming up
from headquarters and when he asked
what ailed custodio the men in the boats
were astonished for they thought he had
returned to us they said he had come
got his supplies and started back since
then nothing had been seen or heard of him
their own action in bringing more supplies
had nothing to do with him but was the
usual arrangement they said they would
keep a sharp lookout on the way back to
see if any trace of him could be found
but they discovered no trace at all

  this of course caused much talk and
argument among us custodio was an
honest fellow and even if he had not been
he would hardly have run away with a few
supplies he might have gone ashore
and been killed by a snake or a jaguar
or he might have been drowned or devoured
by alligators or piranhas none of those
things however would have destroyed
his canoe and the empty canoe would have
been seen by some one it might be that
indians had killed him and taken all he had
but this did not seem likely each of us
had his own idea of what might have
happened but none of us knew anything
more than the fact that he was lost

  gumercindo penria was the next he
was a steady thrifty man who had worked
among us for a long time and had never
gambled he had accumulated a large

account with the coronel he had a little
family at a place well down the river and
now the longing for home had grown too
strong in him and he was going out

  the coronel who is always very kind to
those who serve him well not only paid
him his due but gave him a handsome
present besides so that he was quite rich
for a man of this region yet partly
because he was so thrifty and partly be-
cause the home fever was burning strong
in him he would not wait for a regular boat
and go home as a paying passenger but
started at once in his own canoe

  since he was going down-river the
coronel asked him to bear a message to
some of our men working some distance
below headquarters telling them to come
in as he had decided to send them into
another place gumercindo gladly prom-
ised to do so

  the men did not come in and after
waiting awhile the coronel sent another
man with the same message this time
the men came promptly they said
senhores that gumercindo not only had
given them no message but he had never
passed their camp

  at this the coronel was much perplexed
and after turning things over in his mind
he sent two men all the way to gumer-
cindos home to see if he had arrived there
he had not nobody knew anything at
all about him nowhere between the
headquarters and his home was there any
sign of him he too had disappeared

  this alarmed and angered all of us
searching parties went out with orders to
find the lost man or some trace of him
and they hunted all along both banks and
sent word far down the river to seek him
but nothing was found neither gumer-
cindo himself nor his canoe nor even his
hat

  after that no man traveled alone we
felt that some terrible thing was on the
river though what it might be we could
not guess we made note of one thing
though-that both of these men had dis-
appeared with something of value cus-
todio had vanished with some supplies
gumercindo with money men who had
nothing were not molested still the fact
that both of those lost men had been alone
when they were destroyed made us want
to travel in pairs whether we had anything
or not for a time this worked well


adventure

nothing happened to any of us except the
usual accidents and hazards of our work

  thiyi came something that struck dread
deeper into our hearts two men dis-
appeared together and with them a whole
boat-load of valuable supplies one of
them lucas macicl was a rather simple
fellow and slow of thought but the other
saldanha saraiva was a man of quick wit
and much experience on the river whose
only weakness was a fondness for women
they were bound up-stream when they
were last seen and somewhere between
that point and our workings the mys-
terious death which haunted the river
reached out and seized them their boat
and all they had as before no trace was
left behind

  while we were searching along the banks
and back in the jungle for any sign of what
had happened to these mates of ours a
fifth man was swallowed up antonio
maciel he was-a brother of lucas this
time the death struck not on the water
but in the jungle

  antonio was one of several men who were
beating through the bush strung out in a
long fine with wide spaces between them
and he was at the end of the line nearest the
stream after a time the man next to him
found that antonio was not answering
his calls he cut his way toward where
antonio should have been he was not
there nor had he reached that place there
was no trace of him he was gone as if
the ground had opened under him and
closed again the last sign of him was a
place where he had slashed some vines with
his machete

 this was too much men now feared
to work-to go in canoes-to do anything
they were not cowards these comrades
of mine but the mystery and silence of this
awful death that left no trace was more
than they could stand some crossed
themselves and said it was no mortal thing
but a demon no man knew when or
where it would strike him down for it
had seized antonio who was on land and
had nothing but liis weapons just as it
had devoured the men on the water who
had money or supplies though our work
went on we toiled always with a cold feeling
on our backs and went always by twos or
threes there was not one of us who did
not shudder at the mention of this mysteri-
ous death

      now pedro had recovered from
his bullet-wound and was back at
work with me we had many talks
about this thing which we called the
death but none of them got us anywhere
yet through these talks we got into the
habit of being together and where one of
us went the other went too so when i
was told to go to headquarters and fetch
back some things that were needed in our
work pedro came with me at the head-
quarters i got what we had been sent for
and as the things were few i gave them
over to pedro to put into the canoe while
i told the coronel how all was going at our
tamo up the river when i came out and
saw our canoe i was astonished it seemed
to be full of supplies

  what is this pedro i asked

  he smiled his odd smile and answered
it is bait the boxes and bags are
filled with trash and as i stared at him
he added the death strikes at men with
full canoes lourengo i would see what
this death looks like

  are you mad i cried angrily is
there not danger enough without inviting
more

  perhaps so he said his brown eyes
dancing if you are afraid we will leave
this bait behind

  of course that silenced me as he knew
it would we pushed off and paddled
away with our worthless cargo after
we swung into our long-distance stroke
some of his recklessness crept into me too
and i began to look forward to meeting
the death and fighting it

  the only thing we did meet however
was far from what we half expected at a
place where a slow quiet creek flowed into
the river a soft call came to us and as we
looked we saw standing there an indian
woman we held the canoe steady and
stared at her

  she was a magnificent woman for she
was tall and shapely deep-bosomed and
full-hipped and she looked as strong as a
man her face too was really handsome
she laughed and beckoned to us pedro
laughed back waved his hand and asked
her what she would have of us she made
some answer but we could not understand
it for we did not know her tongue then
she waved to us again to come ashore

  pedro who was in the bow drove his
paddle into the river to do so but i backed
the spider



water and held the canoe where it was
for though the things we had been sent
for were few they were badly needed at
our tambo and we were under orders to
waste no time when pedro scowled at
me i reminded him of this and told him i
had had enough of his foolishness and that
we would go on at once still we stayed
there a few minutes out on the water
while he and the woman talked back and
forth without understanding each other
at all then we went on paddling fast
to make up for lost time

  the sight of this woman had surprized
us much for we knew of no indians along
that stream-their country was farther
west and south had she been a man it
would not have seemed so strange for the
savages are rovers and hunt for long dis-
tances away from their homes but a woman
all alone on the bank was something to be
wondered at we puzzled about her as
we went on and concluded that a band of
the indians must be living near the stream
for a time as she certainly would never be
there unless some men were about as i
have said she was the only person we saw
on all our trip the mysterious death
never molested us so when we neared
our journeys end i said

  let us now throw this bait overboard
it has caught no fish

  very well said pedro and we drew up
to the bank to do so

  but suddenly as he reached for the first
bag a strange look dawned in his face as
if a great thought had struck him

  lourengo he said hoarsely that
woman-i wonder if she too was bait

  i frowned at him wondering what he
meant but he did not explain instead
he said

  we will not throw away our bait we
will hide it and use it again say nothing
of the woman lourenfo i have an idea
and later you shall know what it is

  so we hid all the trash beside the water
and marked a tree so that we could find it
again and went on to the tambo

  now in this gang of ours there was a
silent surly man who had been a lone
rubber-picker in very wild parts of peru
and bolivia and who knew indian tongues
he was said to be a refugee from both coun-
tries because he had killed men there and
most of us left him alone as much as
ssible

  now i observed however that pedro
was with him a good deal pedro was the
sort of man who can make friends with
any one and even this sour suspicious killer
liked him what they talked about pedro
did not tell me and i asked  questions
this went on for a time and then one night
pedro took the gang-boss aside and talked
with him after that he came and told me
to clean my rifle and prepare to go down-
river and in the morning we went

  at the place where the marked tree stood
we got our bait again and arranged it so
that it looked much different than before
then we went on down-stream ready for
anything that might come but nothing
came

  when we reached the place where we
had seen the woman we held the canoe
and pedro gave an odd cry like a bird i
recognized the call as one he had been
practising since he began talking wfth the
peruvian outlaw we listened but neither
heard nor saw anything so we went on
at intervals he called again and at last
there floated back the same call from the
jungle we stopped the canoe where it
it was pedro called again and again
came the reply soon a figure appeared
among the trees and we saw the savage
woman

  hold your rifle ready lourenfo he
whispered

  i seized the gun and cocked it watching
the shore he began to talk to the woman
using strange words which meant nothing
to me but which she evidently understood
for she responded at once now i saw why
he had spent so much time with the man
from the west who knew indian languages
he had been learning how to speak the
savage dialect himself

  she laughed that woman and chattered
eagerly to pedro and waved to us to come
to her but that we did not do pedro
shook his head and once he pointed up-
stream and said more things

  after a time he began to paddle again
and went  down the river and left her
behind we passed around a bend and
then another and when we were well out
of sight he turned the canoe toward the
shore-across the river from the bank where
the woman had stood at a good place we
landed and there he arranged our cargo
again to suit himself he laughed at all
my questions and made no answer but his


adventure

eves sparkled and his face was alive with
his thoughts though at times he looked
a little puzzled and doubtful too

  when he was ready we went back up-
stream this time he gave no call and
we paddled steadily until we reached that
place where first we had seen the woman
there he turned toward the little creek
and as we neared it i saw her again pedro
had made tryst with her and now he
stepped out on land and went boldly to her
i stayed in the canoe

  i think there is no danger here lou-
rengo he said but be alert

  he talked more with her while i watched
them and everything around them as
before she chattered and laughed with him
and i could see that she admired him much
which was not strange for men admired
him too-he was so tall and straight and
strong

  i saw also that he was questioning her
and that she was not answering all his
questions once she wanted to look at
the stuff in our boat but i warned her off
and pedro himself held her arm and stopped
her

  finally he stepped back into the canoe
and we went on up-river until we were
out of sight there we picked a place
to camp and stayed there that night
lighting no fire

  before we slept he told me that the
woman was living in the jungle with a man
but what sort of a man he was or where
he lived she would not tell him this man
she said was away somewhere that day
and what he was doing she did not know
when pedro asked her if she would lead
us to the mans camp she refused then
she asked what we had in our boat and
he told her they were supplies for a new
camp it was then that she tried to look
at them and we prevented her after that
she asked where this new camp was and
he told her at a certain place well up the
river where there really was no camp and
where none was intended in leaving her
he told her he would not work the next day
because it was his birthday and he would
come to meet her again at the same place

  i ask you again pedro i said what
is the meaning of all this and why are
you so interested in this savage woman

  loureno he answered we are now
not very far from headquarters all of
our five friends whom the death has struck

have disappeared not far from headquar-
ters-or so i believe the place where we
first saw that woman is not far from head-
quarters the place where she answered
my call today is still nearer to headquarters
more than that she answered from a spot
very near where antonio maciel vanished
now there is a riddle for you to puzzle over
i amgoing to sleep

in the morning we took out all
our bait and put it into the bush
pedro sat a while and watched the
creeping shadows and when it was time
we went down the river again as we
paddled along i said

  pedro if this woman has anything to
do with the death as you believe then
we are fools to meet her again where you
agreed for we are likely to go into a trap
and never come out

  he laughed and replied-

  if the death is what i think it is it is
now up the river seeking that new camp
of which i told her and so it can do us
no harm

  he seemed to be right for the woman
awaited us and they talked again for some
time and nothing at all happened i could
see that she was very much taken with my
handsome companion but as before he
could not make her answer all his questions
after we left her he said

  she is no fool lourengo for all that
she seems so simple still i think that in
the end we shall learn what we want to
know

  when i suggested that we hasten matters
by going straight to the place where she
had answered his bird-cry and searching the
jungle there he snorted and replied

  oh yes surely that was just what
antonio was doing-searching the bush at
that place and there were more men in
his party than in ours have patience
comrade and do not jump in the dark
this silenced me

  we hid for the rest of that day and that
night and then we went to meet her again-
for the last time as it turned out she
seemed sulky and when he tried to put
her in better humor she answered crossly
and we saw that something had happened
since we left her yet pedro finally coaxed
her into a cheery mood and she began to
smile and give him soft looks

  later i learned that she had blurted out
the spider

that he was lying to her because there was
no camp where lie had said of course
that instantly showed him that his shrewd
guess had been right and that she or her
man had sought that camp he was not
foolish enough to let her see his thought
however and he told her that the plans
had been changed and the new camp was
being made at another place after that
they talked on for some time and he told
her how handsome she was and so on

  i was crouched in the canoe as usual
watching everything like a cat and listening
all at once my ear caught a tiny sound in
the bush-a soft rustle as if something
had brushed stealthily against some leaves
pedro and the woman were talking low
and i put all my attention on that little
sound it might be only a wandering
breeze a crawling snake or some other
natural thing but i had to be sure soon
i heard it again very soft and i knew
something was creeping nearer to us
then at a place where the tangle was very
thick i saw a slight movement caused by
something about the height of a man

  take care pedro i shouted

  like a flash he dodged and leaped forward
landing several feet away like a flash an
arrow sped through the place where he had
been i threw up my rifle and fired
straight at the spot where i had seen the
movement but even as my finger pressed
the trigger i knew the bullet had missed
for a violent shaking of leaves showed that
the man there had thrown himself sidewise
then while i was throwing another cart-
ridge into the barrel the killing of that
man was taken out of my hands

  the woman sprang at the bush in
one hand she held pedros machetc which
she had snatched from his belt with that
weapon she hacked and stabbed in a furv
that was terrible to see i caught glimpses
of a body writhing under her and heard a
snarl a broken scream and a groan then
the body lay still and we heard no sound but
the slash of the long knife through the leaves
as the woman struck and struck and struck

  for a moment pedro and i were para-
lyzed then pedro seized her and twisted
the dripping machete from her hand i
jumped ashore and while she stood shaking
and sobbing with rage we dragged the body
out and looked at it

  for deus muttered pedro the
spider

yes senhores it was the spider
he was a frightful thing to look at
but he was the spider-the man
whom we had thought dead and who now
truly was so even in death he looked
the spider for his arms and legs were
crumpled up as if something had smashed
him from his belt hung a narrow bag
made from a skin ami in it were several
arrows stepping into the place where
his woman had killed him we found his
bow-a short clumsy but powerful weapon
that could drive an arrow clear through a
man at close range

  while we were looking at this we heard a
dragging sound and stepped out in time to
see the last of the spider with one hand
the woman was hauling him to the river
there she picked him up as if he were only
a monkey swung him and threw him out
into the water

  he struck and sank with a soggy splash
a moment later the water began to seethe
and boil we knew the piranhas those
ravenous cannibal fish were swarming
upon him and chopping him into frag-
ments so thick were they that some of
them were crowded up into the air snapping
their jaws like traps a red stain grew on
the surface and slowly drifted down the
current with that hellish boiling going on
under it before long though the water
grew quiet again and the red stain floated
out of sight

  then the woman looked at pedro the
hatred faded out of her face her fierce
eyes softened and she took his hand and
led us away into the jungle we traveled
for some distance and stopped at length
in a place where pedro looked about and
said-

  this is where antonio disappeared

  we could not see anything strange
though at one spot the tangle of vines
and bush was very thick and matted to-
gether as it may be anywhere in those
forests the woman saw we were puzzled
and she walked up to that tangle-and sud-
denly she was gone but she called and
we followed her and as we reached the
matted vines a part of them moved out-
ward like a door and there she was laugh-
ing like a little girl playing a game

  senhores that was the spiders nest-a
lair made from the growing bushes and vines
so cunningly twisted and woven among
themselves that a man could stand within


adventure

ten feet of it and never suspect that it was
a shelter and hiding-place if ever there
was a great trap-door spiders nest that
was it

  the man schwartz had followed the trap-
door spiders example inside his den as
well as outside that spider as you prob-
ably know not only makes a door which
swings shut behind him and covers that
door with things that grow around it but
he also makes a secrct pocket at the side of
his nest where he can hide if any enemy
discovers his lair and the spider had
done this also

  at one side of his den the ground rose
and there he had dug a hole and covered it
over with the growing things so that
nobody would ever know it was there it
was not meant to hide in though but to
conceal the things he took from murdered
men in that hole when the woman
showed it to us we found all the property
of custodio gumercindo saldanha and
the brothers maciel there was gumer-
cindos money the supplies taken from the
others and their weapons and even their
clothes but of the men themselves there
was no sign anywhere

  when pedro asked the woman what had
become of the men she said that after the
spider killed them and stripped them of all
they had he did with them just what she
had finally done to him-threw them to
the piranhas which quickly destroyed
them

  their canoes she said he hid until
night when he took them far up the quiet
little creek where we had first seen her and
there where neither flame nor smoke
would be seen by any one he burned them-
all except the light fast canoe of custodio
which he concealed very cunningly and
used himself in this he made his spying
trips going at night and staying away for
a day or two no doubt he had been al-
most beside us more than once lying low
watching and listening with that spidery
patience of his and learning whom he
might kill with profit

  in all these murders the woman said he
used the bow and arrow which was silent
and easy enough to handle at close range
in all the killings except that of antonio
maciel he made her lure the men ashore at
some place where he lurked ready to
strike them down to custodio lucas
and saldanha she had called and showed

herself just as she did to us and they came
to her and so to their death gumercindo
was caught in another way for he was a
shrewd man and was hastening home and
thus was not so likely to tarry for any
savage woman the spider had had her
stay out of sight though near the water
and scream as if in great danger gum-
ercindo like a brave fellow he was sped to
shore and dashed into the bush to save the
one who was in such distress he was
shot in the back for his pains

  antonio maciel was killed because he was
coming straight at the spiders nest with his
machete ready to cut through what he took
for a natural tangle through a small
opening in the side of his den the spider
shot him and dragged him swiftly inside so
that when the other men arrived they found
nothing but the last place where he had cut
his way that was some distance back
from where he died

  we learned too that pedro and i were
to have been the next victims if we had
come near enough the spider had a
place down-stream where he could watch
what went on at headquarters across the
river and he saw pedro load up the canoe
with what looked like many supplies and so
hastened back and made the woman run to
that place at the creek and play her part
when we passed on our return while she
tried to bring us ashore he lurked ready
to kill us but when we refused to come
he was too wise to attack us at a distance
so he let us go

  so pedros foolish bait caught some-
thing after all though even he did not sus-
pect that the spider still lived he carried
that bait to see what might come of it and
later he believed that the death was some
indian

 when we came back and pedro had
given the bird-call of her people she was
alone for the spider was away somewhere
spying and she wanted us to come ashore
only because she was hungry to talk with
the man who could speak her own tongue

  after she left us at the creek she told
the spider on his return of our new camp
and all our new supplies he went seeking
it came back angry and beat her from
that time on she told him nothing more of
us but met pedro secretly she did not
know that the spider had followed her on
that last day until pedro jumped and the
arrow flashed by him then her hatred
big medicine



of the spider which had long been growing
in her flamed out in the fury that destroyed
him

  she had no love for him but had been
sold to him by her people whom he had
met by chance in the jungle before he came
back to the river and made his lair he
gave the headman his rifle for her she said
and though he had used up all his cartridges
so that the gun was useless the headman
made the trade because women were plenti-
ful in his tribe but guns were very scarce
and he might be able to get cartridge

  she told us also that her people knew
where there was gold and that the spider
had planned to get much of this gold in
trade for the supplies he took from our men
thus in time he hoped to become very
richand then perhaps would make his
way into peru where he was not known
and where he icould enjoy the wealth

gained through the deaths of honest men

  so you see senhores it was as i told you
at the beginning-this man lived like a
spider and he died like one if you know
spiders you know that the female is larger
and stronger than the male and that often
she turns  him and destroys him the
thing that destroyed this spider was the
fact that he did not know this big hand-
some womans heart

  though i do not claim to know much of
women yet i have observed a few and i
have noticed that when a man treats a
woman as something bought and paid for
the time may come when lie had best be-
ware of her i have noticed loo that when
women meet men for whom they care it
makes little difference whether they are
fine ladies from rio or humble maidens of
the village or savage women of the jungle-
at heart they are all the same

tom flood was the windiest
man in gatun he hadnt hit
town but a few days when some
one allowed that he sure was
big medicine to hear him tell it ala-
bam goodloe who hailed from kentucky
and talked like a coon bet a five-dollar gold
piece on floods come-out that night in a
crap game down in house  on the new
gatun road

  flood threw the double six the double
ace and the ace deuce the first three shots
which in the natural consequence of tilings
cost alabam thirty-five dollars for he was
doubling his bet each time he then bet
forty and flood threw the double deuce

little joe for a point the crowd laughed
at this mess of slow craps for there are
more sevens on a pair of bones than there
are fours o my brothers

  goodloe passed the dice back to flood
with anything but hope written in his face
and as flood shook diem and pounded
them against his head for luck alabam in
that pleading tone peculiar to a nachel
bohn crap-shooter had called on him as
follows

  looky hyeah big medicine you bettah
had make that ah-uh joah shake rattle
and roll em way out sundry other re-
marks followed in crap-shooter jargon

  the faders shouted with laughter some


adventure

looked quickly for signs of anger in floods
face at the nickname goodloe had called
him for men sometimes do not take kindly
to construction-camp appellations which
are usually epithetic in character and have
to do with outstanding personal and physi-
cal traits at that time we had in gatun
a step-and-a-half a three fingers
big and little baldy gimpy slim
shorty and many a tex and red
with a descriptive adjective preceding and
a cowboy lawyer from tucson

  flood however caught the joke and
laughed louder than the others and in a
few days every man in camp knew him as
big medicine many people on the zone
never knew what his real name was

  if a name ever fitted a man this name
fitted flood he was big in every way
-six foot three inches of awkwarkness
big hands big feet and the double joints
on his knees and wrists stuck out like
knobs his face was a brick red and his
thin hair and eyebrows were white as cot-
ton not from old age but from being born
that way for he was nearer thirty-five than
forty his mouth was wide and filled
with short heavy teeth his eyes were a
china blue and stared as frankly as those
of a dolls in a kentucky derby flimflam
stand at coney island

 he looked outlandish in commissary
khakis zone fashions for men ran to stiff
brimmed stetsons of the same type worn
by the zone police and pigskin puttees
flood retained his big round-topped west
texas hat with flopping brim and a pair
of mexican leggings that snapped on the
side with a steel spring and fastened under-
neath the instep with a buckle and strap
they extended above his knees in the shape
of a semicircle when he carried his jacket
on his arm his heavy suspenders caught and
held the eye for men wore belts on the
zone

  and talk this was the biggest part
about him his voice was loud and his
laugh a guffaw his words boomed up and
down the streets and through the flimsy
bachelor quarters which were unceiled
buildings with partitions running part way
and lattice-work the rest of the way be-
tween the rooms when he was in one of
these buildings his laugh could be heard in
all the others in that area

  on the four days following the monthly
tour of the pay-wagon with its yellow money

for white men and white money for yellow
and black men the coin of two realms itched
like cooties in mens clothes those of the
gold roll whose inclinations were toward
games of chance listened for big medicines
laugh and drifted in for a game of poker or
to shout incantations to the ivory cubes
and when we were broke on the other
twenty-six days of the month we looked for
a crowd on a porch of one of the quarters
and went there to hear big medicine shoot
the bull

  he had been everywhere he was born
in a covered wagon somewhwere out in the
panhandle and as far back as he could re-
member his old man and old lady had
been among the first to put out in the direc-
tion of any rumored gold strike land boom
or other frontier rainbows end when
finally they had settled on the rockiest and
sandiest patch of land in the mormon
valley of idaho he with his natural heri-
tage of gipsy blood had set forth to ap-
pease his wanderlust in many lands he
had broken horses and roped steers from
alberta to chihuahua been a railroad
shack miner stage-coach driver lumber-
jack harvest hand trapper hunter swiss
guide quaker medicine man sailor before
the mast tropical prospector and tramp
and explorer in both arctic and antarctic
expeditions

  he made his advent on the zone by walk-
ing through from acaponeta mexico
stepping out as he expressed it after a
fashion fast and furious those of us
who had made the same walk listened with
more than casual interest and quizzed him
on the landmarks he knew the little
turn the big banyan tree the deserted
fishermans hut the broken adze the grass
village he could not have bluffed other
men made shrewd inquiries at the psycho-
logical moment for the panama canal
zone was a good place to get caught out
on a limb men who worked there had
been in every nook and corner of the globe
it was something like the snug harbor
home for sailors on staten island where old
men between seventy and ninety can tell
you the exact telegraph pole and window-
pane in that little obscure port you spoke
about

  many of us knew that floods yarns were
consistent he embellished the truth he
handled it carelessly he stretched it out
almost to the breaking point he tossed it
big medicine



up and caught it precariously with one
hand behind his back but he was never
trapped in a bare-faced lie he was a
master at enlarging an incident until men
held their sides and roared with him or
stood with gaping mouths as he related
just when where and how he had been
mixed up in some dramatic occurrence
he laughed heartily at his funny sallies
and was the big hero in most of the others

big medicine was some sort of
a general foreman down on the rock
storage dump back of new gatun-
a settlement of saloons negro tenements
silver roll men with families who did not
care to live in the government labor bar-
racks and camp followers who did not work
for the i c c he had several native
straw bosses with gangs of spaniards and
west indian blacks working for him and
three american locomotive crane-runners
the rock trains dumped the stone at the
top and the large chunks either rolled down
at once or were pried loose and started
down by the gangs at the bottom they
were picked up and reloaded into skips
placed on cars and taken to the locks and
dumped in with the concrete orange-
peel buckets or chains were used by the
craneman

  each days work and the trip down and
back through new gatun supplied flood
with material for hours of yam spinning on
the piazza in the cool of the evening-or at
least when the evening should have been
cool but usually wasnt he had heard a
negro wench talking to a sanitary inspector
in patois english seen two naked kids
fighting one of the crane-runners had re-
fused a bottle of beer from the water cooler
in floods office and he had phoned for the
ambulance a bajan had delivered a sermon
to a group of others behind the tool house
he had sent three castilians for a box of
dynamite and had had to go after them a
gallego had made a funny remark in un-
grammatical spanish-anything it was
all grist for his story-telling proclivity

  he had little education reading and
writing with difficulty but he had a flow of
picturesque language that was at once
gripping and startling he brought to the
zone expressions that remained for months
after he had gone such as shoot where
hes standing without giving him time to
jump up claw him from his forehead to

his umbilicus tear him up as if the hogs
had chawed him pull his eyeball out a
foot and flop it back into place and scare
him re-jake and back at you again with
my stack of yallers just barely and the
like

  and these dead as they look in cold
print were replete with meaning in the
mouth of this big red faced white eye-
browed man lie could mimic a swede
any type of lime-juicer from a remittance
man to a liverpool gorblimme-bill a
western judge any type of spaniard and
almost any other kind of man he had laid
eyes on north caroleenians he dubbed
down-homers explaining that they all
went to virginia and spent the rest of their
lives talking about down home east
texans were boll-weevils and rawzum-
bellies and they raised lean do-gie
cattle whatever kind of cattle that is

  life was one big joke shot through with
dramatic incidents down on the porch of
house  no man went inside and went to
bed until flood did-it wasnt any use
thats how windy he was men sometimes
passed the wink when he was spinning his
fighting yarns and a good one hundred per
cent said to each other behind his back that
they did not think he would harm a fly that
he just liked to talk and no one had ever
seen him sore for so much as a second it
was out of reason that a man as good-
natured as he was should ever have had
trouble with any man

  and then a man moved into house 
who did not seem to take kindly to him
he also had drifted in over the trail from
somewhwere or other he didnt say just
where and had been running a stiff-leg
derrick down at mindi and had been trans-
ferred to one of the cranes on floods rock
storage dump he and flood had showed
up walking together the first evening he
appeared at house  and that night he had
been one of the cirtle gathered around big
medicine after that they did not show up
together and when the group gathered this
newcomer sat far at the other end by him-
self we took it for granted that flood
had given him a call on the job and that he
was peeved about it

  he was as big a man as flood but of a
different type he was tall and rangy
swarthy of complexion with a small waxy
black mustache quiet as a grave dangerous
as a machine-gun boasting of his prowess as


adventure

a fighter by his silence more than flood did
by his words he passed no wink but he
often turned and listened gravely with a
half sneer on his lips when flood made some
particularly bald assertion in regard to some
fight or other and it seemed that fighting
had become the theme of the majority of
big medicines tales with himself the fight-
ing son of a gun from way back

  those who saw he doubted floods
stories had little use for him they them-
selves looked on them as things to be taken
with a sprinkling of bichloride of sodium in
spots but he was a good entertainer he
was a sort of vaudeville performer and no
one expected the exact truth to the letter
no man ever went to a picture show in the
y m c a while flood lived in house 

   flood wasnt afraid of this newcomers
opinion or didnt appear to be he would
tell some outlandish story of fighting and
gun-play where he was the big it and then
he would rear back in his chair and peer
through the bunch to see how the crane-
man took it he told us in a loud aside
that the stranger was nig barberly an
ex-tinhorn from salina cruz and that he
was pizen and meanern a kyotie

   further he said little in answer to whis-
pered queries other than that they had never
been good friends and had had words on the
job over the work and that some day he
reckoned he would empty a gun into nigs
carcass so fast it would cut him right off
at the top of the pockets

   barberly heard this and walked into his
room soon to return with a bristling
cartridge-belt buckled around him every
man in the crowd noticed this but flood
was in the midst of a yarn that required all
his attention when barberly reappeared

   from this time on we noticed that the ill
feeling seemed to grow more pronounced
on both sides flood raising his voice many
times for barberlys particular benefit
barberly growing more silent and sneering
in his solitary chair at the other end of the
porch

  these porches by the way were four
rooms long and were heavily screened with
bronze mosquito-wire the screen door
was just opposite the door to the house in
the center-information little required by
men who know gatun and the road that
wound around the top of the hill to new
gatun as a rule floods end of the piazza
was crowded with men who either lived in

house  or neighboring quarters or paused
on their pilgrimage to new gatun and re-
mained to get an ear-full

one evening after supper we fore-
gathered as usual it was during
the dry season and the red sun hung
poised a few feet over the caribbean down
beyond colon for the sun sets in the at-
lantic from the c z it was hot and some
men lolled in pajamas and some in gaudy
silk kimonos they had won in chinese raffles
flood had pulled his leggings and shoes off
and sat in his shirt sleeves with his heavy
braces thrown down from his shoulders

  hotter than the setting sun were his
yarns of battles on blackbirders down in
the south seas when he was the bosom pal
of old cap durfee blood flowed snarling
lipped men sprang upon each other and
beat and mauled and slashed to a fare-ye-
well desert sands glowed white under the
boiling sun and along trails dotted with
human skulls daring men ventured with
flood usually in the lead bands of swash-
buckling revolutionists attacked and
smashed the enemy fighting valiantly and
sapping their way through intervening
buildings

   through mad stampedes in the far north
we surged flogging the lagging huskies with
the singing whips sheath knives gleamed
greasily in the murky light cast by swinging
forecastle lamps as with a table leg we
met the onrush of pockmarked portuguese
sailors we shivered and munched gum
drops and ate dried pemmican at the two
poles of the earth the ice groaned and
upheaved beneath us and outside our
igloos of snow the wolf dogs howled mourn-
fully

   flood painted with a lavish brush but
colder than the arctic or antarctic wastes
sat nig barberly at the other end of the
porch swarthy faced silent and sneering

   at the conclusion of one of floods nar-
ratives he took his feet down from the rail-
ing cleared his throat spat through the
screening and turned his chair half around
in our direction he expelled the air from
his lungs in a contemptuous grunt

   flood reared up and looked across at him
for a few seconds like an angry lion then
he began telling about beating up a certain
individual in salina cruz he took great
pains on the personal description of this
individual painting him as a tall lanky
big medicine



man black-mustached silent to surliness
underhanded mean low-down and very
dangerous in the cunning way of a snake in
dog days his description fitted barberly
so well that most of us were dividing our
attention between the story and watching
how nig would take it

  flood elaborated he had just ended a
sentence about said party in question being
so honery that he would beat up his own
granny and take up sprouted corn when
we noticed barberlys face contort into lines
of horrible ferocity his white teeth
gleamed through his snarling lips a
volley of oaths roared from his lungs as he
cursed flood for every liar and so-and-so
imaginable

  big medicine sprang three feet in the air
and went for him all spraddled out whoop-
ing like an indian barberly whipped out
two  colts and began shooting from both
hips

  alabam goodloe always denied being
the first to jump through the screen for
it was torn off the entire end of the porch
by the swarming crowd some ran up the
road toward the eating-house and some ran
down the road toward new gatun and some
ran around and watched proceedings their
morbid curiosity to see bloodshed and
slaughter getting the better of their judg-
ment

  i was one of these latter and when i got
out in the road flood was writhing on the
door in horrible fashion and groaning like a
stricken bull he struggled to his knees
and from the recesses of his shirt and pants
drew forth a sawed-off shotgun with the
stock whittled into a pistol handle-the
most ghastly shooting-iron that any man
ever laid eyes on when both barrels
went off it sounded like the premature blast
in culebra cut the time teddy was
down

  i was nearing the hospital on the hill be-
tween there and new gatun when  heard
live feeble little shots like a pop-gun from
back in that direction but i didnt turn to
look back i was on my way for the ambu-
lance and in my heartfelt desire to get help
as soon as possible had forgotten that there
was a phone in the hook and ladder house a
few doors above house  had i remem-
bered it is doubtful whether i would have
tried to use the phone for the girls were
very popular and connections hard to get
after the men had left off work on the job

a few evenings later when flood
narrated the incident to an unusu-
ally large bunch on the porch he
gave what i hadnt seen as follows

  me and nig both fell sprawlin and the
few that hadnt yet joined the bird gang
showed signs of speed and tore up the
ground getting away them big poky dot
suits bellied out behind and them red
shimmies stuck back like table tops i
hyeard women screaming as they passed
them four-family houses above the eatin
house i peers down the road and theys a
motley crew of them hittin the high spots in
that direction with sandy working in the
lead in a suit of b v ds turning sideways
to keep from flyin i look straight down
below and see slim and banjer-pickin
charley tearin through the swag for the
z p station buckjumpin the high weeds
and ditches

  this has all took place in a second and a
quarter and were yet holdin our mouths
with our hands to keep from squallin and
laughin and were faunching and wringing
and twisting all over the floor and makin
funny noises in our throats at the joke weve
sprung when nig and i both glances up and
sees something that puts that supper
weve ate right against our epiglotis

  theys an arm poked out the winder
weavin back and forth and death hell
and the grave pintin in our general direc-
tion in the shape of a new york bull-dog
pistol with the barrel an inch and a six-
teenth long and the caliber of pedmigel
tunnel whoever he is aint lookin out
but squallin on his hunkers on the inside
and aimin to shoot le-guess and be-god
i reckon he knows his weapon for them bull-
dogs spit and shave lead and kick and are
dangerous at all points of the compass when
they go off

  as the hammer begins to raise me and
nig puts for the screen door on our all
fours like a couple of bears before a kansas
cyclone nig swears he straddled me and
rode me out the door i remember dis-
tinctly that i thought he was that little
six-bits i jode for lew warren in prickly
pear valley out near east helena and i
skinned both heels spurring nigs cartridge-
belt he buckjumped from the door to the
ground and i reached for leather but there
warnt none and he throwed me first
time i was ever throwed by man or beast
and ive forked catalo in my time and rode

steers in town fairs we dove under the
house side by side

  that old bull-pup says bowie up above
and theys a chunk of lead as big and flat
as a dollar digs a gopher hole between our
heads and theys an aftermath of shavings
and sawdust pours down on us nig rolls
one way and me tother and we hear three
more shoots shot and the balls a-tearin out
through the ceiling and the tin roof and we
know the old short nose is performing true
to form

  at the fourth shot whoever had the gun
has throwed it from him and it bounces out
the door into the road nig claims he seen
the hammer strike a rock but from where i
lay the gun appeared to twirl around and
take due and deliberate aim at the upper
left-hand corner of my shirt pocket i seen
the hammer raise heard her click and see
her go off she jumped three feet and a
quarter in the air and a trinidad nigger in
my gang says it knocked the bean pot square
out of his females hand just this side of
the reservoir

  by the time we gels sealed on the steps
and ive taken out a deck of kyards and
begin dealin us a friendly hand of seven up
all of gatun new gatun half of mindi
and a quarter of mount hope is foggin in

that although im a man of few words i
can hand out a good single-handed line of
talk when im forced to

  i staved off the ambulance men who was
for talcin us to the hospital the z p who
wanted to jug us the sanitary inspector
who wanted to lick us for tearin the
screenin the colonel and the major who
wanted to fire us and our fellow house-mates
who wanted to kill us it took seven
quarts of sunnybrook before we declared
peace among ourselves and with the world
in general at midnight

  although i heard big medicine tell the
yarn a dozen times adding various new
lights to it on each repetition i never heard
him mention how we found sinbad the
sailor a little hunchbacked new york
jew named sindeband at a late hour
wedged in behind a clothes closet shivering
and crying with fright thinking hed shot
nig barberly in defending flood from him
sinbad thought the world of big medicine
and manys the tale flood afterward spun
for his particular benefit

  finally big medicine sprung the big sur-
prize when jumbo the blacksmith got on a
rampage and climbed his frame down in
front of the eating-house men who saw it
claimed there never was such another fight
south of the rio grande river for they
fought for an hour flood licked big
jumbo to a standstill and the two of them
went down into new gatun to have a drink
together theres exceptions to all rules
and we had to acknowledge that big
medicine was one of them

throats in peril

the puzzling intermittent flashes
came again distinctly as neill
mcneill with his back to the
sun that was just lifting above
the horizon that rimmed the golden-brown
desert gazed with a troubled forehead at
the spot where the phenomenon had ap-
peared he did not like it he told himself
even while he strove to find some natural
explanation for the dazzling streaks that
came irregularly enough yet with a pre-
cision that hinted at some systematic
method of production flickering like minia-
ture lightning from the low western hills
whence their little caravan had recently
emerged

  it might be caused he thought by the
level rays of the rising sun shot back from
the shoulder of a ledge heavily flaked with
mica shifting from the various facets with
the changing angle of the golden beams but
he had not noticed any indications of mica
in those sandstone hills and he was apt to
notice such things it was his business as a
professional traveler and adventurer to do
so

  another series of the hashes started and
flickered out and mcneill shook his head
slightly

  im hanged if i like it he said just
above his breath looks as if some one
were signaling in morse though if it were
morse i could read it it may be a chinese
code at that if so who are they talking

to theres something fishy about this
hurried return trip the old boy was in
too much of a hurry to get back to peking
and-i wonder

  his gaze wandered over the sleeping
camp two mangy camels sulky even in
their sleep lay with their heads stretched
out on snaky necks a dozen pack and
saddle horses dwarfed and shaggy stood
dejectedly about at the end of their
pickets

  by the side of his own dog-tent was the
humped canvas where howard remsden
snored on one side of a primitive screen
while on the other his stepdaughter
helen slumbered far more gracefully and
easily spoked out around the ashes of
last nights fire sprawled half a dozen mon-
gols as mcneill looked keenly at these
counting them first one and then another
writhed and twisted in the sleep that was
already beginning to be disturbed by the
sun there had been a long irek the night
before and man and beast had been ex-
hausted before the dry camp had been
pitched

  suddenly mcneill gave vent to a short
exclamation and swiftly silently passed over
the sand soft and line as ashes closer to the
lire and the sprawling mongols his ups
parted in a smile as he peered closely at
the nearest figure-lifeless a huddle of
clothes and dirty sheepskin

  neat trick that he told himself
slipped out of his duds now then-

  his practised eyes easily picked up the
trail of sandal-prints that led from the
group over low waves of sand that so


adventure

blended in the strong level light as to give
a false suggestion of flatness

  his hand dropped to an automatic bol-
stered at his right hip as he swiftly crouched
to a kneeling position one hand supporting
him the other  the grip of his gun while
he stretched his neck and looked over the
crest of a shady billow

  his dark blue eyes matched the hue of the
steel of the pistol gleaming- through nar-
rowed lids at the almost naked figure that
squatted on the farther slope facing the
spot where the flashes had shown in the
hills a brown long-lingered hand clutched
a disc of polished silver lilted so as lo catch
the sun-rays flaring off at premeditated in-
tervals a long or short glare of intense light
as the curving hand rocked back and forth
on the supple sinewy wrist

  one flash caught mcneill fairly in the
eyes and made them water he noiselessly
shifted his angle and then inched back rose
upright strode past the mongols and dived
into his dog-tent from which he almost im-
mediately emerged and started to shout at
the sleeping men in their own dialect with a
vigor that soon brought some semblance of
concerted action from them a fire was
started and preparations made for the
morning meal

  the man who had been manipulating the
silver mirror appeared yawning as he came
over the low dunes he was of the northern
clans a giant in stature as tall as mcneill
even broader-shouldered and with arms that
swung his hands close to the knee-caps a
long knife unsheathed flashed red on his
thigh he hailed mcneill with a morning
greeting and the latter responded with jaws
that shut grimly after the salutation

  its the first time i ever saw them mir-
ror-talk in china neill was thinking but
theres no reason why they shouldnt
lots of things i havent seen and never will
and those priests-

  well start in fifteen minutes ling he
said to the tall headman well drink tea
and eat after we get on the march

  lings mask of old ivory did not change
but his voice was gently deprecatory

  the master and his daughter are not
yet arisen he said the beasts are
tired

  that is my affair snapped mcneill
i am your master in this business and
you have your orders see that you
obey

  he could sense that the rest of the mon-
gols had suddenly stiffened in their atti-
tudes temporarily frozen keen to some
tenseness in the situation and the whip-
like crack of mcneills voice from lings
agate eyes showed a momentary gleam that
might have been the light of any of a dozen
emotions none of them friendly the
gleam died before the steady light in the
coldly blue orbs of mcneill ling turned
away with the ghost of a shifting grin on his
yellow face to his shrill syllables two of
the men shuffled off toward the camels and
three others after the horses

  a flap in the humpback tent of native
design was thrown back and a girl came out
slim in her brown holland riding togs
putteed helmeted with a pith topcc her skin
slightly tanned her eyes even bluer than
mcneills and her hair yellow as ripe corn
she was barely up to mcneills shoulder
but there was no suggestion of delicacy
about her slender figure or the free vigor
with which she walked towards him

  i suppose there is no water to spare for
anything but tea she said not for
myself though i am gritty and grimy to the
last degree but father is fussing about
shaving

  mcneill ran his fingers over the stiff red
stubble of his own lean jaws and grinned

  not a chance of it before nightfall he
answered i wish youd ask him to hurry
weve got to be moving have to eat in
the saddle this morning

  she looked at him inquiringly but turned
and went back to the tent while mcneill
gazed after her admiringly then he
wheeled ling had come up behind him
noiselessly

  well asked mcneill

  one of the camels is very sick-too sick
to travel

  slit its throat and leave all its load we
can get along without tents for the next
three nights

  ling looked at bun evilly

  four of the horses are badly galled he
said three more are sick we have
come too far too fast we must rest

  you know we are short of water said
mcneill why do you disobey my or-
ders

  it is not possible to obey them o my
overlord answered ling his face deferen-
tial eyelids down his soft voice impudent

  back of him the mongols had gathered in
the dragons claw



a half-ring looking covertly out of almond
eyes that glittered like those of snakes

  mcneills left arm shot out caught the
waist-cloth of ling and drew the giant to-
ward him lings right hand shot down
to the haft of his knife but swifter still
mcneill had drawn his automatic and
jabbed its blunt muzzle hard into the
stomach of the mongol

  you dog he said drop that knife
drop it or-

  lings unwrinkled lids were wide now
in his stare came the red light that shoots
from the black opal and tells of hate and
murder but the knife dropped to the
sand and mcneill put his foot upon it
then he swiftly searched ling for more
weapons found another knife and a cheap
revolver with three cartridges in the cylin-
der the shells he tossed far away with a
jerk flinging the pistol after them

  miss remsden he called

  the girl came running out of the tent
behind her followed a stout man with a
fussy important face that was scorched
rather than tanned whose clothes fitted him
badly and became him worse a bow-legged
bow-stomached person who most evidently
essayed to be a personage and who strutted
like a gosling his pale gray eyes were
inclined to pop and now they strained at the
action going forward

  whats this mcneill whats this he de-
manded in a pompous voice mcneill paid
no attention to him speaking to the girl

  my rifle-in my tent and then get
yours

  she got the first and sped back for the
second mcneill stepped back from ling
who had stood immovable since the drop-
ping of the knife the muzzle of the rifle
swung in an arc of command about the
semicircle of mongols

  first to move moves once only
warned mcneill now then mr rems-
den please go over them carefully and re-
move all their weapons miss helen will
help you cover them one by one as you go
about it

  remsdens red face had gone patchy and
his hands shook but the nervousness of the
man was evidently purely physical he
was not a coward and he nerved himself up
to his task backed by the girl at
mcneills directions he tossed the miscel-
laneous assortment of weapons into a heap
the latter ordered ling to make them into

a bundle using a sheepskin and tying the
package firmly with strips of leather

  ill carry this said mcneill till we
come to the first hole dirt or water now
then break camp leave the tents and heavy
baggage saddle up jump

they jumped and mcneill rifle at
carry walked to his own tent and
picked up his field-glasses as the
mongols spurred into feverish activity
stripped down the canvas mcneill fo-
cussed his lenses and looked anxiously to-
ward the western hills after a little hesi-
tation remsden camc over to him

  what have you found out neill he
asked what was it a mutiny

  mcneill turned on him

  ill answer you that question he said
when you tell me what you were up to at
the temple i suspected something when
you wanted to come away in such a tearing
hurry

  remsden blinked at him from between
his sandy eyelashes

  why there was nothing to stay for any
longer he said we had seen the ritual
i had got all i wanted

  i dont doubt it said mcneill the
point is what did you get

  remsden blustered

  i employed you as guide and interpreter
mr mcneill not to poke into my private

affairs

  as things have turned out they are my
private affairs said mcneill coldly if my
life is my private affair which i think it is
to say nothing of your stepdaughters life
i dont know just how highly you value
your own

  he broke off to hasten the final prepara-
tions for departure the girl was already
mounted remsden got patchy again and
then his face flamed angrily

  you have given me no explanation he
barked i repeat that whatever i do on
this trip for which i hired you has nothing
to do with the contract what lias hap-
pened

  i caught ling heliographing to a party
in the hills said mcneill briefly i
think he was answering orders to delay us
i took up a collection of their cutlery to
prevent a throat-cutting i dont know yet
whether i have succeeded look at that
dust cloud there where the sun catches it
thats a party after us and they will come


adventure

swiftly ill bet a thousand dollars they
are priests of the hoang lung

  he caught the shifting of remsdens eyes
and nodded

  i thought so he added i dont
know what youve been up to but its
three days to peking seventy-two hours
and just about a seventy-two to one shot
that we dont get there better get on your
horse mr remsden ling thats the pass
you talked about last night isnt it how
far is it

  he pointed to two dark purple juts low on
the eastern rim of the plain lings eyes
glinted

  twelve hours he said if the horses
and camels hold out

  theyll have to but we wont go
that way ling well strike south until we
strike the chang-li river well keep in
the gullies out of sight im going to ride
in the rear ling and if i think or if i
should just happen to think that you are
trying to signal back any change of our
plans ill shoot the lot of you ill defile
your bodies and leave them to the vultures
ill cut off your queues and burn them to
ashes get my meaning you do then
start

  ling snarled like a trapped wolf openly
forgetting to mask his feelings mcneill
grinned back at liim the girl rode over to
the latters side and he changed the grin to
a smile as he surveyed her fearless eyes and
her trim seat on the pony

  we are in some danger mr mcneill
she asked he looked at her and frankly
nodded

  and then some he added a bit grimly
thank god im not afraid to tell you
but we are going to get out of it all right

  im sure of that she replied quietly and
rode ahead to join her stepfather

  mcneills smile came back as he surveyed
her as the little caravan descended into a
shallow ravine with rocks protruding here
and there through the sand like dry bones
he began to whistle softly a scrap was for-
ward and mcneill loved a fight it was only
when he thought of the girl that the muscles
in his jaws tightened and the whistle was in-
terrupted

  back in the western hills the dust cloud
moved swiftly down and out into the plain
steel points and blades twinkling here and
there as the sun pierced the veil of floating
soil

 chapter ii

in the canon

down in the blackness of the ravine tin
thin thread that still persisted in the
watercourse tinkled over the flinty stones
the walls of the canon lifted clear and
sheer five hundred feet dark blots of purple
the narrow strip of sky above them as seen
from the floor of this valley suddenly ap-
pearing in the sandy desert as if the granite
precipices had thrust themselves up through
the yielding soil was studded with stars
there was no sound but the sharp voice of
the waters emerging from the sands to lose
themselves again where the ravine ended

   a perilous ledge led along the western cliff
and passed the black gorge of a cave that
slanted sharply upwards after a brief passage
that ran back level for perhaps a hundred
feet at the mouth of the cave rifle across
his knee sat neill mcneill craving for the
smoke he might not permit himself

  forty-eight hours had passed since they
left the camp where he had caught ling
heliographing and all his senses warned
him that danger was very close at hand
he knew it from the attitude of ling and his
followers their surliness was lightened
they had seen had heard or smelled some-
thing that liis over-civilized perceptions had
missed he knew the priests must have
been misled at first but they were indubi-
tably far better mounted than the remsden
party and not all mcneills skill had been
able to obliterate trails

  both nights he had bound the mongols
hand and foot by day he herded them
they were utterly one with the pursuit
they were eating up the scant supply of food
and at times tried to delay the march until
mcneill threatened to shoot the first recal-
citrant but if he left them free it would
but be to augment and advise the enemy
and he had a plan in mind by which
he could still use them despite their
wishes

  both the camels he had killed as too slow
taking valuable time to bury them deep so
that the clustering carrion birds should not
act as guides only two of the horses were
in any shape to travel remsden had
ruined two already with his weight and
clumsy riding the detour had delayed
them and they were still thirty hours from
the outskirts of peking and until they
the dragons claw



reached the foreign quarter of that city they
could not reckon themselves safe

  possibly not then meditated mcneill
watching the opposite sky-line

  there was no trail on the face of the other
cliff so he covered the ledge on their own
side and was on guard against surprize
at the end of the straight tunnel remsden
and helen lay resting if not asleep ling
and the rest were tucked in a niche none too
comfortably and mcneill himself had tied
the soaked hide-strips that fettered them

  i wonder he went on in thought just
what the old boy did back there at the
temple he was hobnobbing with that
sleek rat fung-ti who got beaten out for
high-priest at the last hoang lung election
remsdens got his own ambitions hed
rather be head of the museum of philologi-
cal research than anything in this world or
the next for that matter hed barter all
he has for that his stepdaughter included
when it comes down to his own ends hes a
devil of selfishness a-ha

  he cuddled up his rifle lightly leaning
forward from the ledge there was more
than a hint of moonrise across the ravine
and his ears had caught the clink of metal-
not hoof on stone since few horses were shod
in that region but blade or point against
stirrup

  then silhouetted against the radiance of
the eastern sky back so far from the edge
that only the upper parts of their bodies
showed there came a file of horsemen
the riders wore queer pointed caps and
flowing robes he could see spears and
guns aslant their shoulders they rode
fast and he counted over fifty

  there was a slight shuffle beside him
ling bound as he was had wriggled his way
to the front of the cave his clothes had
caught on something and the force he had
summoned to break free had betrayed him
even as he raised his face and opened his
mouth to shout to the dark riders across the
canon

  with a sidelong sweep mcneill brought
the butt of his gun down on the base of the
mongols skull and the cry died in his
throat but it was a close call and mcneill
patrolled the cave to the niche where he
inspected his prisoners and gagged them
with dirty strips from their own clothes
threatening them with a knife if they made
the tiniest sound then he went back to
where he had left ling

  the ledge was empty

  came to and rolled himself over mc-
neill decided now i wonder just
why

  the answer came to him almost imme-
diately the riders were coming back
again and mcneill could see two of them
dismount and peer down into the black gulf
evidently suspicious of the sound they had
heard-the slump of ling into the canon
he could have picked them off easily but
to remain hidden was of paramount impor-
tance they had but a small supply of
water besieged in the cave they must
soon give in

  no other sound came from the fallen
ling who had sacrificed himself in vain to
serve the fierce priests of hoang lung
the smashing drop of a quarter of a thou-
sand feet had beaten the life out of him

  theyll stay till morning mcneill told
himself and then theyll find him un-
less-

  he went back to the end of the tunnel
where the natural rift narrowed and went
up in a narrow irregular ramp under this
mcneill paused once he wetted his finger
and held it up in the darkness he thought
he could detect a faint stirring of the air
from the pocket of the coat he wore for
the night air was chill he fished out an
electric torch and slipped the switch the
beam fell on the sleeping face of helen
remsden as she was styled having adopted
the name of her stepparent mcneills
jaw hardened as he gazed at the beauty that
even the cruel forcing of the last two days
flight could not eradicate from an angle
to the right where the tunnel side-pocketed
came the faint stamping of horses and the
reek of their bodies then he shifted the
ray to remsdens puffy countenance and
stooping shook him by the shoulder

  eh what

  ssh cautioned mcneill come with
me to the cave mouth  want a talk with
you

  his tone was imperative and remsden
yielded to it without further grumbling
by this time the moon had topped the
further wall and was whitening the ledge
outside by and by its light would steal
down into the depths and perhaps reveal
the body of ling sure sign that the white
men were beleaguered near by

  mcneill thought of climbing down and
either bringing back the body or hiding it


adventure

  beneath loose stones but in such dark-
ness he could not hope to eradicate all
marks of the fall from the sharp eyes that
would surely be seeking for them as soon as
light permitted there would be spatters
of blood and in the meantime there were
other things to do-hopes to work on
remsden was one of these latter

mcneill tackled his employer
without formality

 remsden we are in - bad

shape theyve got us cornered the
hoang lung crowd has just filed along the
cliff across the way they are suspicious of
this place and theyll hang around till
morning there are only two horses fit to
travel

  how do you know they are the hoang
lung crowd they may be just a band of
robbers with whom ling was in league

  ill bet you know it is the hoang lung
outfit better than i do remsden in
point of fact it doesnt matter who they are
so long as they are hostile if they get us-
well what they do to us two men dont
count so much ill take good care they
dont get miss helen alive but they are
nasty devils and their sort of vengeance
dont stop at death now i am pretty
certain youve got us in this scrape-
something youve done at the temple if it
was sacrilege we cant help it now if
youve stolen something you and that sleek
rat of a fung-ti perhaps theyll make
terms with us if you give it up and its
up to you to do it

  remsdens beefy face was rigid with
obstinacy

  ive done nothing that can be undone
he said

  mcneill keeping the ray shaded from
without suddenly threw the light on
remsdens face and surveyed him keenly
the pop-eyes showed only a sullen dogged-
ness

  it was all right for you to risk your own
life for whatever you were after went on
mcneill but though you told me and told
your stepdaughter you only wanted to wit-
ness the ritual i dont believe you but
now you are risking her life and mine for
that matter youve fooled both of us
its two lives against yours and both of
them younger ones ling somehow slid off
this cliff a little while ago he went on
moodily you might do the same thing

  you mean you would kill me

  if i were sure you had something on you
that would save the girls life by giving it
up i would without compunction
remsden gulped

  you can search me if you like mcneill
ive got nothing on me you can search
my baggage destroy it if you like youll
find nothing i wanted to see the ritual

i	may have offended them but youre on
the wrong track there must be some way
out of this it isnt just a question of
money mcneill i told you id give you
a bonus if the trip was satisfactory ill
double that ill triple it if you get me
safe into peking that was in the contract
-to guard as well as guide get me safe
into peking mcneill and ill give you a
thousand dollars ill give you five

   wouldnt accept five cents for trying to
save your skin said mcneill ill do the
best i can for you as per contract now
you get back to the end of the cave ill
need you presently

  you think we can get away asked
remsden persistently

  i said for you to get inside said
mcneill so grimly that the stout man crept
obediently away

  presently mcneill followed him the
girl was still sleeping he switched his ray
into the rift above his head and clambered
up the slanting way it was some four
feet wide and the sides were damp with
moisture it narrowed but he wormed his
way on and then backed down again

  it goes through he said to himself
and its all soft earth im fairly certain-
just a landslide theres a chance-for her
and by the eternal well open it up if i
work those chinks fingers to slivers of bone

  he kicked up the drowsy mongols prod-
ding them with a knife in one hand threat-
ening them with his pistol in the other
explaining to them what he wanted

  soon they were at work with stirrup-
irons with pots and metal cups with jagged
cans one above the other in a living ladder
digging at the soft soil passing it down in
improvised sacks and panniers from the
pack animals working desperately under
mcneills supervision they labored in
the dark save for occasional spurts of the
torch but they made good progress
remsden watched without speaking to
mcneill who had no time to spare for him
and then the girl awoke and came feeling
the dragons claw



through the dusk of the cave to see what
was happening mcneill spared a minute
or so to tell her

  theyll locate us by morning he said
but they wont lind us i was sure i
noted a current of air passing down this
shaft that has filled up in some landslide
during winter rains it is not at all prob-
able they know of its existence once we
break through we can get the ponies up
there and make a clean getaway while they
are trying to rush the ledge or fooling about
in the bottom of the ravine we can hold
them off from the cave-front indefinitely
as long as we have water she corrected
theres moisture enough in that shaft
to keep us going for a while answered
mcneill but ill make shift to show
them our chinese friends we have with us
and as long as they think they have us
trapped theyll go leisurely about it in
the meantime you and mr remsden will
be streaking for peking

  and you what are you going to do
me im going to amuse myself giving
a lesson in marksmanship to the hoang
lung crowd until ive made them very shy
of doing anything else but try and starve us
out you see they wont figure we have a
back door and not use it then when
ive got them cautious ill come scooting
hotfoot after you two theres the piu-
kiang river ten miles east-by-north and
there are little villages here and there
you must buy a boat or steal one and take
to the stream steal one if you can itll
leave less trace

  you keep on saying you  she said
you get a boat we shall wait for
you

  no you wont mcneill answered
i may have to strike quite another trail
once out we must scatter and join as best
we can you stick by your stepfather
ill show up

  she was silent for a minute then she
objected-

  there are only two horses that can
travel

  three lied mcneill the yellow
pony is feeling fine again

  are you telling me the truth she
asked

  ask mr remsden said mcneill
  father she appealed

  yes my dear mr mcneill knows what
is best there are three horses we must


rely upon his judgment those coolies are
slacking up i think

  mcneill went after the mongols and the
girl subsided he did not dare to leave the
workmen though he dreaded letting the
body of ling remain in plain sight in the
ravine not that it much mattered he
thought if they got through the tunnel all
right his own chance of getting away on
the yellow pony was pretty slim but his
duty as he saw it was to see to the best
chances of the girl and of the man who had
indubitably employed him as guard as well
as guide

  the current of air was steadily stronger
now and then he climbed up among the
men blinding them with his light ignoring
the murder in their faces making them turn
their backs while he inspected whipping
them with his will and the fear of death
lest they strangle him in a sudden rush
it would not do to let them get too close
to the ultimate opening that he must
clear himself or they would give the alarm

  and after hours of incredible toil the
thing was done it was close to dawn and
the moon had gone with the stars paling
when mcneill broke through to the open
and found a fortunate masking of bushes
and scrub trees all about the hole once
again he herded the bound mongols to their
niche and then with remsden struggling
with blistering hands to help him the two
white men enlarged the mouth of the shaft
until it was wide enough to allow the egress
of the dwarf ponies all this time the girl
stood on watch where the horizontal tunnel
opened on the ledge above the crushed body
of ling while the mists began to wisp out
of the ravine and the sunrise was imminent

mcneill got the two horses up the
incline and saddled them while
remsden gathered such provisions
as they would need then mcneill fetched
the girl

  he pointed out to them the lay of the land
that sloped toward the little river that in
its turn would bring them out on the water-
highway to peking he gave them brief
instructions as to their course handing
them the maps and two rifles with ammuni-
tion remsden could use enough chinese
dialect to make his offers of money under-
stood and as long as they kept ahead of
the fanatic priests and their influence mc-
neill had little doubt that they could buy


adventure

their safety to peking at the last mo-
ment when mcneill had crawled off to the
cliff edge on a reconnoitering expedition
the girl rebelled

  we shall not go without mcneill she
declared at least i shall not he is
deliberately sacrificing himself for us
you are talking foolishly my dear
answered remsden nervously mcneill
is not a fool he is not throwing away his
own life i have promised to reward him
munificiently when we are safe in peking

and-

  the girl looked at him scornfully

  you think everything can be bought
with gold she said

  well answered her stepfather with
smug complacence there are few things
that can not by the way you may give
me back the wallet it will be safe with
me now i was afraid of light fingers while
the chinese were with us i sleep so much
sounder than you

  contempt still in her eyes the girl took a
leather wallet from her bosom and gave it to
remsden the latter furtively fingered its
bulk and slid it out of sight before mc-
neill came back through the brush

  they are down in the ravine he said
they have found the body of ling
soon they will be coming along the ledge
i shall use our prisoners as a barrier until
you have got well away then i shall
come after you but do not wait for me i
am sure you will get through all right and
there is no need to worry about me i shall
be at the imperial hotel within a few hours
after you-perhaps before take the right-
hand gully go slowly at first and be
careful not to throw up any dust if you
find a boat get rid of the ponies dont
give them away turn them loose as soon as
you see your way clear on the river now
off with you i have got to get back to the
entrance

  he saw the rebellion in helens eyes

  m revoir miss remsden he said
let me help you mount i assure you
that i am in no more danger in remaining
than you in going-probably less on my
word of honor

  she looked deep into his eyes and slowly
blushed

  if you do not arrive when you say
within a few hours of us she said so low
that remsden for all his straining ears
could not catch the words i shall come

back after you

  mcneill saw them disappear into the
gully his hat off to the girl and then
hastened down again to the tunnel he
picked out one of the mongols and pricked
him ahead with his knife-blade until the
latter showed himself reluctantly at the cave
entrance

  immediately there was a flash from the
opposite cliff the singing of a bullet the
spang of its lead on the rocky lintel of the
cave and the echoing report the china-
man shrank back and mcneill laughed

  they meant that for me ba-ti he said
presently ill return the compliment

  he had no intention of firing where he
was not sure of a target every moment
gained helped remsden and the girl and
when he did fire he wanted to put the fear
of his marksmanship into the priests they
thought they had him earthed a good
shot or so would make them cautious

  he tightened up the foot-ropes of the
mongol and put him back with the rest
then he made a little barricade of loose
stones and sat down to guard the ledge
he did not dare expose himself to harass
those in the ravine but he hoped that they
would attempt to rush the narrow path

  two hours passed and then a fusillade of
bullets smashed about the cave mouth and
buzzed down the tunnel the comers of
mcneills mouth turned up into a little grin
he squinted down the ledge lying flat in a
conduit he had made of the rocks thrusting
his rifle through a niche

  as he expected a rush was on a cluster
of racing figures turned a shoulder of rock
and mcneill began firing rapidly but with
definite aim two figures leaped up and
plunged into the gulf another sprawled out
on the ledge a fourth dragged back around
the buttress

  that will keep them thinking for a
while mcneill told himself i wonder
how about the other direction

  he turned over and even as he turned
heard the soft pad of swiftly running feet
the priests of hoang lung had split and
had meant to attack simultaneously some
inequalities of the path had hindered their
perfect junction and once again mcneills
rifle took heavy toll two men shot almost
simultaneously whirled clutched at each
other and went spinning down

  thatll teach em not to be in too much
of a hurry muttered mcneill as he slid
the dragons claw



fresh cartridges into the chamber while
stray bullets still sung and splashed above
him i dont believe theyve got more
than a couple of rifles at that he told him-
self now for the next move i dont
believe theyll try another rush-try and
starve us out i dont fancy they are wor-
rying much about those chinks ive got
corraled neither am i i wonder how
many miles are left in that yellow cayuse

  his half-formed plan crystallized as he
went back into the tunnel and flashed his
torch over the bunch of bound mongols
one man he selected as close to his own
build though lacking in height this man
he shuffled back to where the rest of the
horses were stalled and at the muzzle of
his automatic ordered him to strip the
man demurred and mcneill clipped him
on the jaw with his pistol putting him out
then he deftly peeled off the dirty unsavory
clothes and reluctantly put these on over
his own underwear after investing the
chinaman with the outer garb of neill
mcneill

  the battery of his torch was dimming
fast as he had worked and it flickered en-
tirely out before he had finished but he
got the limping pony to the top of the shaft
and the chinaman with it he had col-
lected the few things he meant to take with
himand now with the wondering hating
eyes of the mongol watching him he
crawled through the bushes for a last survey
of the enemy crawled back and with almost
the last of his water supply unflinchingly
scraped off with a dull blade all the sprout-
ing red growth on his jaws

  then he surveyed the lay of the land
to one side where almost three hours
before remsden and his daughter had made
for the river the fissures offered him ample
cover to the other the land opened to a
flat plateau sparsely set with dwarf growths

  mcneill forced the mongol to mount the
tethered yellow pony that was in no way
anxious to move tied his feet under the
animals belly and his wrists to the saddle-
horn once again he slid through the bushes
and fired a random shot across the canon
the echoes crashed as answering bullets
came wildly back he cut the tether
headed the pony for the plateau pricked it
sharply on the flank and fired a couple of
shots beneath it that sent it flying fearfully
through the scrub bearing a figure in euro-
pean costume on its back crouching to

avoid the missiles that sped toward it at
long range and then mcneill dived swiftly
into the nearest depression and making the
most of his start fled for the chang-li
stream

  at nightfall mcneill squatted by the
wall of a hut outside its door the chinese
were gabbling the local gossip the boat
of duk sing had been stolen sing had
found it gone when he started for the eve-
ning fishing the boat had vanished but a
gold piece was lying by the tether picket
wrapped in a scrap of cloth so sing was
lucky for the boat was old and chee foy
had found two ponies with their saddles
it had been a great day said wong lee the
headman it was good to talk but he
must be going for the tide was right and
they were waiting for his cargo in peking
he envied sing his luck money was scarce

  as wong lee started to go aboard his
cargo-boat where the polers only awaited
his coming a figure came out of the darkness
and asked in the dialect of the district for a
trip passage

  not free oh wong lee said the
pleader as the headman scowled for by
the favor of my aunt i have some small
matter of money with me and the trip is ur-
gent i am sick

  there was a lire burning on an iron plate
amidships of the long craft with its thatched
cabin and high prow by the uncertain
light wong lee looked doubtfully at the
stranger the mans head was bound up in
filthy cloths that concealed all but a strip
showing nose and cheek-bones the brow
bandage came so low as to hide the eyes

  what is thy sickness asked wong lee
and where is thy money

  it is not catching lo i have been
suffering long from decayed teeth and the
night air brings on the pain so i journey
to peking to seek a doctor here is half of
what i possess

  out of the waistcloth in which his auto-
matic was tucked away handily mcneill
produced some copper cash and two small
pieces of gold he held these out on a palm
blackened with dirt wong lee swept all
of it into his own paw

  get aboard he said magnanimously
i will send thee to a cousin of mine who is
a mighty doctor in peking pole pole
swiftly ye doghearts the tide runs

  as the cargo boat shot out into the
stream mcneill glancing back saw torches


adventure

suddenly break out in the village and heard
the racket of voices that betokened the
sudden arrival of some cavalcade some
one ran down toward the river-landing
swinging a flare and shouted but wong
lee with an oath took no notice and the
craft shot swiftly down the broad stream
none but the boatmen had seen mcneill
and that at the last moment if the new
arrivals were the priests of the hoang-lung
they had no reason to suspect the entirely
regular departure of wong lee there
came a bend in the stream and the shouts
and lights died out and mcneill cuddled
down on some mats in the cabin groaning a
little from time to lime about the decayed
teeth that he was forced to protect against
the night air

chapter hi

the features of fung-ti

after nine years of wanderings in in-
terior china prospecting engineering
adventuring neill mcneill with his knowl-
edge of customs and dialects was compara-
tively at home in peking he changed his
filthy rags for occidental raiment at a
nalive lailors who was lo him more of a
friend than a mere tradesman and lhus
rehabililated hurried to the imperial hotel

  on the trip of the cargo-boat he had
found no trouble in picking up the trail of
the eccentric american and his daughler
remsden wilh a smallering of chinese was
no fool and once free from immediale pur-
suil he had got together an escort and
traveled with speed and comfort

  mcneills connection with him would
soon be over the latter thoughl regrel-
fully he meant to lake no bonus for
however much he admired the stepdaughler
he had a very whillled-down eslimalion of
remsden and his selfishness that would
deliberately expose the girl to frightful risk
through his own rash actions but mcneill
meant to see them both safely oul of the
country

  the cult of the hoang lung the guard-
ians of the holiesl of all shrines was power-
ful and remsdens offense which must have
been a serious one would not be lightly
condoned remsden was apt to consider
himself safe in lhe foreign quarler and be-
come careless trouble could easily hap-
pen even on lhe train to shanghai whence

they would embark for the states and it
would be trouble of a kind that could not be
remedied

  a fanatic follower of the hoang lung
would think nothing of giving up his own
life and risking torlure if he achieved his
objecl even lhe arm of lhe american
government would be hard put to it to pro-
tect the travelers and mcneill shrewdly
surmised that the american minister would
not be appealed to by remsden too hur-
riedly as the latter knew that confession
of an attempt on his part to interfere with
chinese religious institutions would be met
with disfavor

  it was with relief that mcneill passed
through the arch inlo the holel compound
and entered the office of the imperial
miss remsden was oul lhe clerk declared
bul remsden was in his room a package
had just been delivered for mr remsden
and the chinese boy who ushered mcneill
-to the suite carried this parcel with him

  mcneill was frowning when he entered
the room remsden should not have al-
lowed his stepdaughter on the streets un-
escorted he thought though of course he
was nol cerlain lhal this was the case
remsden greeted him cordially enough

  im glad to see you back neill my boy
he said we were both anxious over your
safety but i assured helen that you would

win through we ourselves had a-

  where is miss helen broke in mcneill
remsden frowned at the interruption
he was looking curiously at the package the
boy had broughl a box some eight inches
square wrapped in rice-paper on which was
inscribed in good english remsdens name
and address

  she wanted to buy some souvenirs for
her friends at home he said i believe
she has gone to the rising sun bazaar

  good- man cried mcneill you

dont mean to say you let her go out
alone

  the rising sun bazaar is only two
blocks away replied remsden it is in
the foreign quarter have you lost your
nerve neill

  you have taken leave of your senses
said mcneill angrily taking up his hat
he was going lo lhe bazaar wilhout delay
how long has she been gone

  why i hardly know said remsden
leisurely setling down his cigar and devot-
ing both hands to the unwrapping of the
the dragons claw



package a little over an hour i should
say i-	-

  his voice died away in an inarticulate
choking that made mcneill half-way to the
door turn and regard him sharply rems-
dens face was blotched his jaw sagged
his pop-eyes seemed actually starting from
their sockets and they were lit with a horror
that showed in his mottled shaking jowls
and the trembling hands which were
still suspended above the box that he had
opened

  mcneill crossed to him picked up the box
and shook out the objects it contained on
a newspaper that remsden had been read-
ing a scrap of paper closely covered with
small beautifully written chinese script
fluttered after them remsden stared
still incapable of action fascinated by the
grisly things before him

  these were the half-desiccated lips ears
and eyelids of a man the black lashes
gummy with dried blood still clung to the
latter

  what-what he muttered as mcneill
rapidly translated the script

   with his eyes his lips his ears he betrayed

  now can fung-ti neither see wrong nor speak
falsely nor listen to the voice of the white devil who
bribes

  fung-ti muttered remsden and
looked up at mcneill who towered over
him menacingly the scrap of paper in his
hands quivering

  do you know what the rest of this
says demanded mcneill listen

   these are the lips and eyelids and the outer ears
of fung-ti the false priest the thief the betrayer

   within ten days restore the sacred relic or what
has happened to fung-ti who still lives but prays to
the gods he has betrayed that he may die shall hap-
pen to the white woman who returns to the shrine of
hoang lung as hostage

   first did we test fung-ti with the ordeal of the
rrazen serpent then did we sever the false mem-
bers we send to you it would he hard to tell now
that fung-ti was once a man yet he lives

   the limbs of the white woman are far more frail
than those of fung-ti they will shrink and shrivel
in the twist of the bronze serpent

  ten days we give you return the holy relic
and the girl shall be delivered to the messenger
fail and not only shall the girl die many deaths but
thou and the man who was with thee shall know the
vengeance of the hoang lung though ye hide in
caverns at the bottom of the sea

   see that ye do this sccretly for if ye appeal to
the governments or speak to any that the shrine of
hoang lung has been dishonored in that same hour
shall ye all die

so menacing was the look with
which mcneill regarded remsden
that the latter threw up his shaking
hands in a semblance of defense

  for the love of god neill he whim-
pered

  stop your blasphemy said the irish-
man do you know what the brazen
serpent means remsden they twine
copper tubes about your legs and arms and
waist and then they fill the tubes with
boiling water that is what they threaten

to do to-

  he struck the heavy table such a smash
with his doubled fist that the panel split
and the horrible bits of fung ti danced
on the paper out with that relic
remsden out with it he demanded
they have got helen give it to me so i
can go after her

  ten days they said-ten days the
shrine is only five days journey

  mcneill gripped remsden by the shoul-
ders and heavy as he was shook him as a
terrier would shake a rat

  you would temporize with the girls
safety he cried ill tell you this
remsden if one hair of her head has been
harmed when i return-and i shall return-
i will make you wish you had been fung-ti
where is this relic

  wait said remsden shrinking into
his chair on his release but with his face
sullen with the piggish obstinacy he could
assume i can not give it to you i
havent got it i cant get it again before
forty-eight hours there will be plenty
of time

  remsden you lied to me before in the
cave you are lying now

  i did not lie to you i said that you
might search me i did not have it with
me helen had it then though she did not
know it it was in my wallet i told her it
bothered me in riding and she carried it
mcneills utter loathing pierced even
remsdens armor

  i am not lying now he asserted dog-
gedly i may be able to get it back a
little sooner than forty-eight hours but
i havent it and thats the flat truth
mcneill his eyes burning within a few
inches of the others told himself that
remsden was telling the truth

  i am going to give you just twenty-four
hours to produce it he said during that
time i am going to make preparations that


adventure

will insure the safety of miss helen if
you havent got it back by then you are
going to be a very unhappy man for the rest
of your life you are not my employer in
this matter you couldnt hire me with
your money to go back i am going on my
own account you can pay me what you
do owe me however as i shall need imme-
diate cash

   remsden detached certain travellers
checks from their sheaf and passed them
over to mcneill

   it is no use threatening me he said
 i will get it as soon as i can-not later than
 forty-eight hours that gives us a margin
 of three days they will not injure her
 what is this relic demanded the
 younger man

  remsdens eyes glowed he seemed to
recover his self-assurance the man was
a trifle mad with the frenzy of a collector
mcneill decided as remsden poured him-
self some whisky and tossed it down with a
hand not yet stead

  what do you know about chinese
mythology neill he asked

   not very much

  mcneill resented the smug manner of
remsdens speech but he was anxious to
leam what he could about the relic

  ah perhaps you know that they be-
lieve that originally the land was ruled by
the dragon kings lords of air land and
sea

   mcneill nodded

   well in the holy shrine of hoang lung
 is supposed to be kept an actual claw of the
 last of the dragon kings-a claw set in
 gray jade carved to represent the sheath
 of the claw and also inscribed with runes
 that even the great lao tse could not
 interpret this claw is probably that of a
 great cave-bear it is of non-retractile type
 it is evidently very old it might even
 have come from some monster of prehistoric
 times the point is that it is believed
 indubitably to be the claw of the dragon
 and the temple of the hoang lung is wor-
 shiped as its repository

  and you got it how

   remsden almost beamed with self-satis-
 -faction

   i got up the expedition to the temple
 i am not a mason but i have knowledge of
 the ancient universal rituals and symbols
 from which modern masonry has borrowed
 they have been long known to the older

dynasties of ancient nations china in-
cluded through their use i was received
by the priests as you know and observed
their ritual something but one other white
man has ever done i noted that the claw
was not a myth fung-ti did the rest
for a very large sum of money that was
packed in the box carried by the smaller
camel the box you with all the rest
thought carried cartridges

  i thought some one had stolen that
said mcneill under his breath

  just how fung-ti accomplished the
theft i do not know i left the particulars
to him he has been frightfully punished
but he knew his risk under ordinary
circumstances nothing would have been
discovered for a full month by which time
fung ti would have been far away had it
not been for that shower of shooting stars
the night after we left the temple the
priests of hoang lung imagine such phe-
nomena the golden scales shaken from the
dragon gods in anger and i suppose they
investigated it was an unfortunate coin-
cidence

  the claw was without doubt the most
wonderful curio in the world it would
have brought me fortune i preferred
fame now i have lost both he sighed

  mcneill regarded him keenly the sigh
hardly seemed genuine but he was deter-
mined that remsden should not leave his
sight until the relic reappeared from wher-
ever it had been deposited that remsden
should have let it leave him for a moment
seemed incredible but he was certain that
in that matter the collector had not lied
for the rest he was an incipient lunatic so
far as curios were concerned

  i want you to go out with me for a
while said mcneill and i shall take
the connecting room to this suite

  where are we going

  to pass the word to certain men that i
know said mcneill i am going on this
return trip with an escort of he-men mr
remsden i take it you would prefer to
stay in peking i should recommend the
embassy after we have gone if they will
shelter you come on his tone was
that of sheriff to his prisoner for a half
moment remsden rebelled

  very well he said at last anymore
ftmds that are necessary

  if i run short ill borrow some from
you snapped mcneill come on
v

the dragons claw

 js thirty-six hours later mcneill
seated in his room next to that of
kaij remsden whom he could hear im-
patiently padding up and down listened
to a knock on remsdens door and to
remsden opening it some one who talked
in a voice of high pitch that was almost
instantaneously hushed to a whisper was
admitted mcneill rose and softly opened
his own door to the corridor presently
he heard the chink of gold and remsdens
door reopening

  he gilded to where his own entrance stood
ajar the light out in his room and saw
gliding along the passage the bowed form
of an old chinaman who was stowing away
something in his capacious blouse the face
of wrinkled yellow skin drawn tight as a
drumhead over the skull showed little but
the eyes looking furtively from left to
right held the look of one who gloats over
greed satisfied and is yet possessed with
deadly fear

  moreover mcneill recognized the man
as the master-craftsman of all pekings
artificers in precious metals and gems in
pearl and ivoy-ling yuan the greatest
connoisseur of all the orient in such works
of art

  it seemed evident to him where the claw
had been for some reason remsden had
consulted ling yuan as to the authenticity
of the claw fearing perhaps that fung-ti
had played him false though the awful
mementoes of that false priest had since
furnished mute proof of his having really
obtained the actual relic wondering a
little what enormous sum remsden must
have demanded from ling yuan as pledge
for the return of the claw mcneill turned
on his light and closed the barely opened
door without noise the next instant
remsden appeared in the entrance between
the rooms

  i have the claw he said take it
neill and save helen

  mcneill took it-a little thing to repre-
sent the burning mystical faith of the most
mysterious nation of the world the claw
itself was black with age and far longer than
that of any animal that neill had ever seen
sharply curved set in gray translucent jade
which was scaled where it gripped the claw
and above that deep cut with hieroglyphs
he opened his belt and shirt and put
the thing away in a pocket of his money
belt

  i shall find a better place for it pres-
ently he said

  remsden sighed as he saw it disappear

  it was a costly experiment he said
how early do you start

  immediately said mcneill there is
not a moment to lose we shall travel fast
but there may be delays my men are
waiting for me now

chapter iv

occident against orient

the temple of the hoang lung the
shrine of the dragons claw lies in a
natural amphitheater the buildings of stone
and sun-dried brick standing in a horseshoe
of steep hills that are honeycombed with
caves and fissures some of which are used as
dwellings for the priests the entrance to
the horseshoe is winged across with stone
walls that connect with high arches also
of stone and carved with weird representa-
tions of the dragon gods and their lesser
attendant divinities

  there are three of these arches and they
were undoubtedly built to serve as defenses
against marauders from the north they
were built many hundreds of years ago
perliaps thousands and their carvings are
smudged with the rasp of wind and rain and
desert sands and there are deep interstices
where once the stone blocks met with exact
precision

  a modern field gun would knock one to
pieces in two shots yet inasmuch as field
guns have never neared the shrine they are
still considered in the light of legend and
dim history impregnable when the wooden
gates reinforced heavily with metal are
closed

  at nightfall of the fifth day after their
start from peking the seventh since the ul-
timatum of the priests had been delivered
to remsden a party -of white men were
camped in the hills some three miles from
the town and temple of hoang lung by
the light of the fire about which they sat
at a war-council with their pipes or ciga-
rets going they were a hard-bitten lean
and capable looking crowd eighteen of
them in all-volunteers under mcneill to
get a white girl out of hoang lung

  engineers prospectors adventurers of
sorts they were and all were known to mc-
neill personally they represented every


adventure

loose and available white man in peking or
its vicinity who could get away for such a
trip their ages varied from twenty-two
to fifty and they were all as hard as nails
every one of them knew how to handle a
gun and was not afraid to do so better
they knew when not to do so

  mcneill stood apart in talk with a
bearded man who had built many miles of
railroad in interior china only to see his
work undone by fanatic hordes urged on by
the priests neills field-glasses were slung
at his sides and he unbuckled the case and
took them out

  the moonll be up in a few minutes
wilson he said its lightening over the
eastern ridge now canfield and i are going
in alone on foot as soon as it rises after
weve fixed things at the first arch well
camp in one of the caves ill go in soon
after dawn-alone

  it seems foolhardy to do that neill
said wilson wouldnt at least a display
of force help out of course youre run-
ning this show

  ive gone over it very carefully said
mcneill ive got to make the play single-
handed at eight oclock if they are not
coming through you know what to expect
if i dont show up here by nine or you dont
see me coming then you take command and
do whatever you think best not forgetting
that it is more than probable that miss
remsden and myself will be past doing for

  here comes the moon now then take
the glasses and look about sou-west-by-
sou there are parallel ridges leading in
that general direction and canfield and i
will keep the valleys though i dont think
there is much fear of a lookout they are
expecting us no doubt but it is our move
and they are not likely to be worrying about
it we are three days to the good you
can use the ridges for cover tomorrow if
things go wrong with me

  wilson the glasses to his eyes only
grunted the arches particularly the first
one were plain to see their stones silvered
by the moon now clear of the ridge

   s up to you said wilson at last
till eight oclock tomorrow then its up
to me goin to take horses

  no less noise less risk we can pack
all we need easily enough a good deal
depends on getting our work done abso-
lutely unobserved

  if you dont come back said wilson

gruffly or if theyve done anything to that
girl im telling you one thing mcneill
before noon tomorrow the inhabitants of
hoang lung are going to think hell or
whatever their heathen equivalent for
gehenna is has opened under their feet
weve got the stuff to do it with and weve
got the boys who know how to use it

  they walked back to the rest of the expe-
dition in silence mcneill had deliber-
ately shut off from his mental vision all
thoughts of what might have happened to
helen remsden suggestions of bronze
tubes filled with boiling water and twisted
around her dainty limbs thoughts of
all the fantastic refinements of devilish
torture that might be practised upon her he
deliberately dismissed as unnerving and
destructive to the job in hand

  he did not trust the priests once they
had obtained the claw they would be likely
to endeavor to get revenge on those who had
had any hand in the defilement of the sacred
relic he had laid plans accordingly

  canfield came forward to meet them the
youngest of the troop a man absolutely
reckless once given his head but possessing
the rare quality of being able to take orders
from a man he acknowledged capable of
giving them

  ready to go mcneill he asked

  if you are

  righto returned canfield britisher
and younger son got all my little duds
packed for the picnic

  then were off announced mcneill

  the talk stopped pipes and cigarets
were taken briefly from mouths that
quietly wished good night and good
luck and the two started on their hike

an hour and a half later two
figures glided away from the dark
shadow of the first arch and blend-
ing in the inequalities of the cliff face after
they had passed the length of the stone
wall in a low crouch carefully paying out a
thin thread as they went disappeared in a
niche where the face of the precipice had
warped apart there they compared
watches carefully

  well check again in the morning can-
field said mcneill i want to pull this
thing off to the second if possible its
three oclock now these priests are a lazy
crowd i wont start until seven and even
then they wont be stirring that gives
the dragons claw



us four hours-two apiece for sleep ill
take the first watch

  youre on said canfield and curled up
in the crevice like a tired dog

  at seven oclock mcneill left the little
fissure and descended unnoticed to the flat
ground in front of the first arch there was
no sound of gong no sign of life within the
enclosure the gates were shut and he
knew the frowsy sentinel slept inside the
holy priests of hoang lung were not ascet-
ics so far as they could obtain it they
lived upon the fat of the land and denied
themselves nothing and by virtue of the
claw their tribute was universal and
munificent

  at fifteen minutes after seven mcneill
took a whistle from his pocket and blew on
it shrilly a wicket in the upper leaf of one
gate was drawn back and the sleepy eyes
of a watchman peered out widened as they
saw the solitary white devil and suddenly
disappeared

  it was fifteen minutes more before the
gates were opened and a group of yellow-
robed and shaven priests appeared escorted
by a score of so-called soldiery armed with a
nondescript array of swords wide-bladed
spears muskets and rifles of all vintages
in their midst mcneill walked through to
the inner courtyard

  a short fat priest advanced he was
ancient his avoirdupois spoke eloquently
of self-indulgence and his face projecting
from the draped hood that puffed about his
full neck held no more expression than that
of a turtle the small eyes showed merely
life no more emotion than if they had been
insets of jet

  tao chan asked mcneill

  this had been the name of the writer of
the letter to remsden the name of the head
priest of hoang lung

  tao chan acknowledged the dignity
you have brought back the claw he
demanded

  is the hostage safe parried mcneill
to talk in questions is to waste time
replied the priest first answer me

   i can make delivery of the claw

  the girl is unharmed

  then show her to me

  show me the claw

  mcneill laughed and a red light came
into the jetty eyes of tao chan

  it is not wise to make a mock of the
guardian of the claw he said

  it is not wise to take a white man for a
fool o guardian that has no claw to guard
answered mcneill show me the girl

  there had been no apparent sign but the
priests fell back and the guards edged in
toward the irishman

  touch me and i destroy your temple
he said confidently

  it was tao chans turn to laugh but
a grin was the nearest he could come to it

  you speak boldly he sneered

  mcneill was gaging his time looking
covertly at the hands of his wrist-watch

  the bargain was to exchange the girl for
the claw he said you know i must be
able to produce the claw or i would not
have traveled so far i must know that
you can produce the girl

  tao chans immutable face gave no sign
and mcneills heart sank then rose again
if they had injured her to them the life
of a white maiden save as they could use it
for torture was nothing he tried a lead on
this line

  also there are many thousands of white
maidens o tao chan and but one

claw

  there is but one maiden for thee white
man

  and yet there are thousands aye mil-
lions who hold thee responsible for the
claw challenged mcneill if i return
not with the girl in safety all china will
know how tao chan has been outwitted by
the foreign devils and i do not think what
is left of thy life will be happy show me
the girl

   still no visible sign but the guards inched
in it seemed clear to mcneill that the
whole thing had been planned before the
gate was opened they meant to get the
claw and wreak their vengeance on mcneill
and the girl if she was not already sacrificed
he looked at his watch it was five
minutes of the hour

  i have warned you he said do you
think i was fool enough to come here alone
with the claw upon me there are yet
three days within which to deliver it it is
not far from here but in a place where you
can never find it first i must know
whether you can keep your side of the
bargain show me the girl

  i think you can be made to tell where the
claw is said tao chan softly

  i do not know where it is said mcneill
so i can not tell you


adventure

  he spoke with such utter conviction that
tao chans face twitched he believed
that the foreign devil might be telling the
truth he gave an order it was repeated
back to where guards lounged on the steps of
the quaintly-roofed temple the lacquered
doors opened and the figure of helen rems-
den appeared between two priests who
stepped back a little from her she gave a
little cry and mcneill whimsically conscious
of the incongruity of the action took off his
helmet then the doors closed again

   we shall not torture you the first said
tao chan very quietly first you shall
watch us work with the girl after that
you may not care to live but we shall give
you certain chances from time to time to
bring in the claw you foreign devil he
continued almost in a monotone that
threatened the more with its repression
did you think you could ravish the shrine
of the dragon god and go unscathed
fung-ti has been punished so shall all
the rest of you be punished your prayers
for pity shall lack lips to utter them

  touch me said mcneill and i shall
shoot you through the belly tao chan
just one tiny touch-i have you covered
now from my pocket-and you will be ex-
plaining to your gods why you could not
keep their claw i give you one chance
tell your men to fall back bring out th
girl in a palanquin borne by four priests
you and four more shall accompany me to
the spot where the claw will be turned over
to you will you do this

  for the last few seconds marked by the
march of the hands on mcneills watch the
two men occidetal and oriental held a
duel of glances

kin the fissure canfield stooped
f pabove a little instrument of polished
rjkliwood and brass for fifteen min-
utes he had been expecting to hear mc-
neills whistle now he knew that the
little lesson they had arranged was to be
given and he glanced at his own watch and
looked over his adjustments with nerveless
thoroughness

   no bluffed the high-priest

  back of them there was a muffled roar a
swift suggestion of exploding gases a cloud
of smoke that mushroomed in which frag-
ments of masonry lofted and rushed down
again while the outer arch crumbled and
dissolved before the eyes of hoang lung

  mcneill had not moved a muscle now
he put the question again

  will you do this or shall i destroy
the shrine

  tao chan thought rapidly he guessed
somewhat of the means employed to level
the arch but it had been done very
cleverly and he could not offset the terror of
his ignorant underlings by a talk on dyna-
mite to them it was all magic mcneill
seemed very confident and tao chan felt
that the white man might use more of
this magic wisdom to carry out his
threat true the girl was in lie temple
but-

  he looked at his panic-stricken guards
at the uneasiness of his priests trained as
they were to avoid emotion and he looked
at mcneill jaunty nonchalant all save his
eyes which were bits of steel the white
devil might sacrifice the girl they did
such things when they were desperate to
save them from torture the claw must
come back he metaphorically tossed in
his cards he was still qualmish in the
stomach that mcneill had threatened

  once more he gave an order whereupon
mcneill whipped out his whistle and
sounded it twice

  canfield picked up his battery and con-
nections and strolled out of his cave

  worked like a charm he said to the
lizards that flickered before him a little
bit of all right that

a baffled mob clustered about
the ruins of the outer arch and
sullenly watched the palanquin borne
by the priests depart under the command of
the two white devils

  mcneill and canfield walked one on either
side of the chair and talked through the
drawn curtains of elaborately embroidered
silk to the rescued helen remsden mcneill
and helen did most of the talking canfield
noticed and being a goods sport he filled
in the time smoking cigarets

  so they came to the camp in the hills
traveling the crest of the ridge despite the
sun for mcneill wanted to make sure they
were not followed amid the ring of men
the priests set down the palanquin

  now demanded tao chan as the
girl stepped out i have kept faith
where is the claw

  what did you do with it wilson asked
mcneill i told our bloated friend here
the dragons claw

that i did not know where it was but he
would not believe me

  tao chan not knowing the language of
the foreign devils glowered at them sus-
piciously

  the white men also keep faith tao
chan said mcneill give it to him
wilson

  the bearded man solemnly uttered a
jargon of meaningless syllables he was in
his rolled-up shirt-sleeves and he exposed his
open hands back and front to tao chan and
the priests

  can ye not see it he asked speaking
fluently the vernacular it was hidden in
the air lord of air and land and water and
of fire was the dragon king he did but
return the claw to its own and now in
promise kept we bring it back again
behold

  he pointed to a spot just above the level
of the wondering eyes of the priests then
between the thumb and forefinger of the
other hand suddenly appeared by clever
legerdemain the claw

  a cry camc simultaneously from the
priests and all save tao chan dropped on
hands and knees in obeisance but tao
chans who could do some pretty conjuring
himself upon occasion frowned and took
the relic from his robe he produced a
case of carven jade lined with golden
silk and reverently placed the claw
within

  as the priests rose to his order they found
hemselves covered by the pistols of the
expedition

  you are going to take a little walk with
us as far as the bamboo bridge across the
wu-liang chasm announced mcneill
to the other side of it in fact then
well say good-by and leave you with the
claw-after we have destroyed the bridge
doubtless you will find some roundabout
way to get back to hoang lung do you
want to ride in the palanquin miss helen
or would you rather have a horse we
brought a spare one for you

  a horse please said the girl i
havent been treated at all badly mr
mcneill but the sooner i can get away
from everything chinese the better i shall
be suited

  mcneill translated to tao chan into
whose face came the suggestion of satisfac-
tion he appropriated the abandoned pa-
lanquin to his own uses and from there to

the bridge the priests spelled each other in
carrying his redundancy

  it did not take the little corps of experts
long to destroy utterly the bridge of heavy
bamboos ingeniously cantilevered by the
chinese across the deep split and then they
left the discomfited tao chan to lead his
men back to hoang lung as best he could
straight for peking they headed well
mounted exuberant losing no time

  helen remsden told them the details of
her carrying off as mcneill had sus-
pected-had practically known-there were
members of the hoang lung affiliated with
practically every bazaar in peking and
when she had walked into the rising sun
bazaar she had walked into a trap that was
promptly sprung a trap that was only one of
a long line set for her throughout the city

  i wanted a mandarin coat or two
she said to take home for gifts i thought
the rising sun with almost always an
american or european customer at every
counter was safe mr remsden said
nothing to the contrary but when i left
the hotel i fancied a chinaman who was
loafing about the compound noticed me
particularly and when i was in the bazaar
i was almost certain that this same man
came in and spoke to one of the clerks
this clerk spoke to the man serving me

  i fancy i showed some suspicion or
surprize and it only shows how clever they
were for the man who was waiting on me
one of the principals of the bazaar i fancy
who talked beautiful english asked me al-
most instantly if i knew the man i told
him that i did not know him but thought i
had seen him before at the hotel

  he appeared to get very angry and told
me that the man wanted a commission on
anything i bought claiming he had recom-
mended me to the rising sun he rated
the man who slunk out i knew of course
that such a thing was very likely to happen
and that almost every tourist purchase has
a squeeze or two behind the price it
sounded a natural explanation and i
thought no more of it

  i had especially asked for a pomegranate-
colored mandarin coat and they had noth-
ing of that shade or near it in the lot
brought me doubtless they took care
there was not at all events the man
seemed disturbed that he did not have one
to suit me and called out in chinese
after the answer he smiled and said that a
adventure

consignment from sze-chuan province had
just arrived and was being unpacked and
priced would i come and see them as
they came out of the bale and take my
pick

  i went into a room at the back of the
place as i passed through the door some-
thing was clapped to my face a cloth
saturated in some pungent drug and that
was all i knew until i found myself inside a
stuffy palanquin on camel-back crossing
the desert

  the rest you may imagine i was fairly
well treated and i knew that mr remsden
would arrange for my release i thought-
i hoped she added a little shyly that he
would send you mr mcneill

 mcneill remembering how he had
handled remsden in the matter smiled a
bit grimly

they were traversing a little rocky
defile that led down to the chang
li stream when a horseman ap-
proached them the diminutive pony was
being pushed to its top speed by a china-
man who swayed in his saddle from weari-
ness when they came up to him for he
could not avoid them in the rocky pass they
saw he was an old man far too ancient to
be attempting such a ride without escort

  he rode his pony to one side along the slant
of the piled-up talus of the ravine staring
at the party half curiously half furtively
the sight of the girl on the horse seemed to
fascinate him then mcneill who with
wilson had been playing rear-guard from
a possible pursuit and suqjrize came gal-
loping up and the chinaman shrank on his
saddle to a mere bundle of clothes hiding
his mummy face by pulling down the folds
of the turban-like head-gear he wore against
the sim

  but mcneill had recognized him though
he did not seek to detain him it was ling
yuan the connoisseur the master-crafts-
man the man he had seen in the corridor of
the imperial to whom remsden had so
mysteriously entrusted the claw in the
chinamans face was the same mixture of
satisfied greed and furtive alarm

  hell be a bit late with his news
thought mcneill and dismissed him from
his thoughts

  next nightfall they rode through the out-
skirts of peking the cavalcade gradually
breaking up as they reached the foreign

quarter only wilson and canfield riding
with mcneill and the girl through the arch-
way of the hotel courtyard

  mcneill dismounted went in and came
out with the news remsden had doubt-
less by cabled influence obtained lodging at
the legation his daughter was to join him
there and tomorrow they would start by
rail for shanghai

  that is bully said mcneill if i
remember right youll just catch the
cathay well see you to the legation
arent you going to stay there asked
the girl its just as dangerous for you
i havent got the drag of mr rems-
den smiled back mcneill i shall be safe
enough the bunch of us will celebrate
our little expedition together i shall see
you on the train tomorrow

  then you are coming to shanghai
wilson in his wisdom had drawn can-
field aside

  i am going across to the states said
mcneill if i can get a spare plank to
bunk on bookings are heavy this time
of year you-you have no objection to
my making the trip with you miss helen
what have i to do with it she chal-
lenged in sprightly fashion then her
lashes fell before something in his gaze
i owe everything to you mr mcneill
she went on seriously my life-more
than that i do not know how i can repay
you

  i do said mcneill ill tell you how
on the trip perhaps

  but the girl however grateful was not
to have her maidenly defenses overrun in
the first assault

  it will be nice to have some one to talk
to she said but i thought that your
profession kept you in china though i can
imagine that fathers folly may have jeop-
ardized your usefulness

  i am not a professional guide and in-
terpreter if that is what you mean said
mcneill only upon occasion i have
made certain discoveries i am going back
to san francisco to exploit them person-
ally i shall lie low in their development
but i hold a main interest in several proj-
ects that promise well

  but you-mr remsden thought that
you- she broke off in charming con-
fusion as she sensed his reasons for acting
as guide to her stepfather

  there were unusual reasons for my
the dragons claw



attachment to your stepfather-and your-
self said mcneill here is the legation
and there is mr remsden good-by until
tomorrow

  he raised his helmet as the girl turned
from greeting her father and waved her
hand to him then he joined wilson and
canfield still discreetly in the background

  i happen to know that old chu lee has
got some pommery still stowed away he
said lets get the gang together and
celebrate

  celebrate or congratulate drawled
canfield

  you pay for the champagne canfield
said mcneill imperturbably and you can
take your choice

chapter v

sing lee laundryman

the cathay was an american ship and
aboard her mcneill soon discovered
himself a comparative nonentity beside
remsden

  the collector was not only rich but evi-
dently powerful by the deference shown
him at the legation and aboard the steamer
no bribes of mcneills were able to get him
closer to helen remsden than six seats
away at the skippers table and remsden
evidently was not disposed to encourage
communications between an irish ad-
venturer whom he had employed as guide
and his stepdaughter presumably his heiress

  he was courteous enough and liberal
enough with offers of reward that mcneill
refusedbuthepooh-poohedgentlymcneills
allusions to his forthcoming exploitation of
certain discoveries

  i hope youll make a go of it neill
he said anything that i can do-but
you say you have the capital in sight its
the concessions that are so doubtful the
chinese government is exceedingly un-
reliable and the various powers are envious
of each other in these matters but i wish
you the best of luck

  there was a sap-headed son of a million-
aire aboard who vied with several others
in paying attention to helen and to this
vapid specimen remsden showed evident
favor though mcneill believed remsden
had better sense than to consider that
helen would accept these attentions seri-
ously or that remsden would use the

young man for anything more than a cats-
paw-a convenient and time-serving barrier
against mcneill being free from the
hoang lung pursuit as he evidently be-
lieved remsden had every intention of
shelving every one connected with it in-
cluding mcneill

  he developed a slight illness that mcneill
shrewdly suspected was assumed and took
advantage of it to keep his stepdaughter
in close attendance upon him with the
young millionaire as a willing aide at
honolulu he took the enamored youth
and helen for a long ride during the wait
of the steamer and mcneill whistled for a
chance alone with the girl moreover
the words of remsden bore some weight
mcneill had no right to court the girl
unless his future was assured instead of
merely being rosy-hued as at present

  and so in the rare moments when he
had the girl alone he did not tell her as
he had hinted at peking how she could
repay him for bringing her safely out of
danger he was the last man to bid for
a girls love because he had done what
any red-blooded man would do for a girl
in peril mutual desire was the only thing
on which to base happiness he decided
if he could avow his love backed by worldly
wealth to attend to all her comforts and
if she showed him his love might not be un-
acceptable then he would put the matter
to the test

  meanwhile he must attend to his own
affairs in san francisco while they went to
new york by the first train leaving four
hours after the cathay docked so with
their new york address and a snapshot
taken  deck he was reluctantly content

  but he did not fail to warn remsden
that all danger might not be over the
chinese were clannish and the power of
the hoang lung reached wherever chop-
sticks were used and punksticks burned
they had back their claw but they had
been flouted they might seek revenge

  poppycock my dear neill smiled
remsden not in america-not now-
adays even hatchetmen and tongs are
out of date i appreciate your anxiety
for my health and that of my daughter
but once in the united states i can well
take care of myself-and her good-by
you must let me know how you come out
with your schemes i may be able to help
you over some hitch-international politics


adventure

you know i am not without some in-
fluence in such things

  neill mcneill had a desire to tell rems-
den just what he thought of his complacent
selfishness but he repressed it the train
was starting and his opportunity for a
personal farewell was going a-glimmering
with remsdens purposeful chatter the
vapid heir was going on the same train
it seemed and buzzing about helen like
a hungry bee at sunset the girl was not
of remsdens blood mcneill thanked
heaven he did not think many ties
bound them save the one of duty on the
girls side duty and a certain gratitude
and so he deliberately shouldered aside
the scion of wealth and won his way to a
last handclasp

  you will let me know how things go
wont you she asked and there was balm
in the undoubted interest she expressed
you have our address and perhaps you
can make the communication personal
there was a suggestion of a blush and a
tightening grip of the hand as she said
this that recompensed neill for the imme-
diate bustling up of remsden and the
official remorselessness of the porter who
warned that the train was just stahtin

mcneill took up his affairs in
earnest registering at the palace
and telephoning the members of his
syndicate for appointments in a determina-
tion to be in new york within the week

  four days went by and he had the thing
well in hand one man who had been in
the southern part of the state remained
to be seen and the rest waited for that
persons assent before going ahead with
the development mcneill had explained
satisfactorily that he was persona non grata
with certain elements in china and his wish
not to superintend the comparatively
simple problems of exploitation yas wil-
lingly granted by those to whom he was the
means of assured wealth

  fix it with cox they told him at a
dinner at the bohemian club convince
him-youve only to show him what you
showed us-and well get to work with
the lawyers tomorrow

  they were fine fellows these westerners
and mcneill felt elated as he left them
he went away early for he had an appoint-
ment with cox out at the latters big house
at san mateo that evening

  as he swung briskly down town to the
palace where he had ordered a car to take
him down the peninsula he fancied as
he had fancied more than once in his four
days in san francisco that he was being
followed probably not by chinamen
for he had reflected that if the hoang lung
had by cable got word across to their
affiliations on the coast they would be
too subtle to use such palpable shadows
there were many degraded white men
chained to chinese autocratic dispensers
of the drugs they craved who would be
willing to play the spy

  it was only the working of a sixth sense
developed in the wilds but mcneill though
he could pick out no special person on the
busy streets thought enough of the hunch
to slip an automatic in his pocket when
he took seat in the tonneau of the big car
that was soon gliding south to the fashion-
able suburb

  there were other cars on the road many
they overtook but none passed them or
seemed to be trailing yet mcneill was
keenly alive to the fact that the fat priest
at hoang lung might smart for revenge
and impart that revenge to his proselytes
as a holy thing to be consummated

  he had warned remsden he had even
warned more carefully helen they were
safer in new york than he was in cali-
fornia but all three were still in jeopardy
presently the thing might die down he
thought as long as the claw had been
restored things changed rapidly in china
a new government might frown on even
the priests of ancient religions who en-
dangered amicable relations by murdering
the subjects of a friendly and powerful
country from whom a new republic might
need favors

  for the present he would look out and
when he got to new york he would safe-
guard helen as closely as she would permit
mcneill had no fear of not convincing cox
as to his proposition then there would
be a good sum coming to him immediately
and with developments he would be a
rich man

  as they crossed the san mateo line a fog
began to thicken but the driver was used
to fogs and the road the lamps were power-
ful and they kept on their way making
good progress until finally they turned in
between high walls through iron gates and
rolled up to coxs ornate italian villa
the dragons claw



  mcneill could not have been received
more cordially by a member of his own
family though this is not a good simile
for mcneill was very much alone as far
as relatives went his hosts hearty man-
ner evident interest and keen appreciation
of his doings and their financial possi-
bilities soon put mcneill altogether at
ease with the world only one untoward
incident occurred to disturb two hours of
satisfactory business talk and establish-
ment of social relations

  cox ordered refreshments the butler
was a chinaman coxs menage was largely
chinese he explained and eminently satis-
factory as a butler the man was perfect-
silent careful deferential not once did
he seem to glance from beneath his smooth
crescent lids at master or guest while he
did his serving but as he left the room
mcneill caught one oblique glance from
those sloe-black eyes directed at him
through the reflection of a mirror the
eyes seemed to appraise to check up to
menace

  mcneill knew what strange tricks imagi-
nation plays when one allows any subject
of peculiar interest to ones mental or
physical welfare to once become dominant
still he was glad to find the fog had lifted
when his car was ordered and he stepped
out into the quiet californian night cox
pressed him hard to stay until the next
morning when they would motor down
together and complete the negotiations
that would set mcneill free to go to new
york-and helen

  but with the absence of the fog the
sense of danger seemed lessened more-
over if any was brewing mcneill wanted
to see it through it was late and the
driver started back at a good pace for the
city in less than half a mile however
the engine began to stall and he got out
for investigation they were on the main
road of the fairly populous suburb on
either side were summer villas standing
in considerable well-tended grounds be-
hind walls or hedges as the owners fancy
chose

  the chauffeur tinkered and overhauled
and at last investigated the gasoline tank
in default of better explanation of their
trouble he gave a sharp exclamation

  empty he said i told them to fill
it up at the garage we ought to have six
or seven gallons and there aint a drop

  did you see it filled asked mcneill

  no i didnt but they never bunked
me this way before

  what did you do while i was with mr

cox

  chewing the rag with his driver they
got two touring cars and a big limousine
he was in the butlers pantry hes a
chink but he sure treated me white i
guess id better go back and get some gas
from mr coxs driver he wont be in
bed yet two or three gallons  get this
boat in	 

  all right said mcneill hurry 

  the man started down the road and he
watched him turn into the gates of the
villa there were a few lights in the nearer
houses and the sound of music came from
one of them it was all very quiet and
peaceful

hthen with a rush they were on
him two figures hurled themselves
over the low wall to his right he
heard the swift patter of footsteps from
behind as he stood at the rear of the car
instinctively he backed up to it and felt
for his pistol the gun was gone the
chinese butler had helped him on with
his light coat and deftly lifted it

  the two assailants were coming for him
head on even in the uncertain light he
felt sure they carried no weapons swiftly
he reached out his long sinewy arms
cupped a head in either palm and brought
them together with a thud that dropped
the two senseless in the dust of the road

  then something flickered about his neck
from behind he knew what it was as it
tightened some one had climbed into
the tonneau and deftly slipped a bowstring
about his neck the cord tightened and
sank into the flesh beyond his power to
loosen a red glare came before him and
he felt consciousness slipping away

  then sudden relief though he sagged to
the ground even as he sucked the air into
his tortured lungs the glaring headlights
of a machine dazzled him as the oncoming
car jarred to a standstill a few feet away
and two men jumped out and came toward
him

  whats up old chap asked one of the
strangers giving him a hand

  mcneill saw that the two whose heads
he had cracked had disappeared so had
doubtless his other opponent it was a
ibo

adventure

close shave only for these two night birds
who had obviously been celebrating it
would have been all off with neill mcneill

  we ran out of gas he said with some
difficulty for the cord had bitten deeply
my man went back to the house there for a
supply and i had a touch of vertigo i
havent been very well

  vertigo thats a new name for it
old pal said the second man ill have
to spring that on my wife we thought
we saw a couple of chaps duck out right
and left as we came along and then we saw
you fall maybe we had vertigo our-
selves

  mcneill summoned a laugh he was
not inclined to give his confidence now
that he was well out of it his driver was
coming back with the gasoline in a can

  im all right now anyway he said
thanks both of you and heres my
driver

  the two got into their car and drove off
while the chauffeur replenished the tank

  see anything of the butler asked
mcneill as they got ready to start

  met him in the garden just now
taking a stroll with a bit of a dinky pipe
strange lot them chinks

  i thought i saw him myself said
mcneill if i didnt i felt him he
reflected and picked up from the seat
beside him a souvenir of the occasion

  it was a slender cord of chinese silk
flexible singularly soft but strong as
catgut and bright yellow

chapter vi

new york

n eill mcneill walked out of grand
 central station scorning a taxicab
the hotel could send for his baggage with
all the fervor of one american born-new
york born at that-who has been ex-
patriated for years in a barbaric kingdom
he wanted to see smell and taste new york
he bought a paper but did not look at it
people interested him more than news so
far he was already wondering how soon
he could call upon the remsdens-upon
helen remsden to be exact it was mid-
morning and he would have to wait until
afternoon he decided but he could send
some flowers and did

he walked down fifth avenue to his

hotel got his room washed up and went
out again on the streets the unread
paper was still in his pocket

  still on the avenue enjoying the bustle
of the crowds the things in the shop
windows he came to madison square
and sat down among the flotsajn and
jetsam of the city presently he pulled
out the paper and gradually became more
and more interested on an inner page
was a half-tone engraving of two men in
the most modem of conventional attire
silk-hatted yet prominently foreign ori-
ental the caption read

  prince liu chi and his cousin prince ten shin
who have foresworn their ancient titles for chinas
new republicanism they come to america as
deputies of the new government to study the
institutions and policies of the united states

  it was interesting reading to mcneill
though he wondered at the strange turn
of mind that changed the descendants of so
old a dynasty to such ardent liberalists
but the establishment of the new republic
upon so firm a basis as to make its envoys
recognized generally by the united states
government as these princes seemed to be
to judge by what they had done and what
programs were still in store for them
officially held a measure of comfort

  the old powers and traditions of hoang
lung would die hard but they might in
the rush of new thought and an open policy
toward the occident die swiftly much
of their power would be curtailed with their
prestige they would lie low awhile until
the ever turning kaleidoscope of awakening
china shifted to a new pattern of the same
varicolored parts

  there would be a lifting of the ban
against the desecrators of the shrine and
the followers of the old legendary faiths
would be content with the restoration of
their relic he wondered if prince liu
chi or his cousin had heard of the outrage
if so their racial traits would hold the
memory despite the camouflage of new
world veneer chinas ancient faith would
not change with its policies save out-
wardly the two nobles were registered
at his own hotel he noted

  another article flashed at him as he
turned the page it was not a lengthy
one but the headlines leaped at him making
the half-inch capitals that formed the
name of remsden seem as large as wood
block freak captions the article read
the dragons claw



  howard remsden celebrated explorer and col-
lector of things anthropological recently returned
from hazardous adventures in the interior of china
was last night unanimously appointed president of
the columbian museum of philological research
a post of great honor among scientists who strive
to build the ancient history of the races of the
world after making his speech of acceptance
mr remsden formally presented the museum
with a curio that is without parallel-a relic dating
back to the myths of ancient china no less an
object than the long worshipped claw of one of the
legendary dragon gods of the flowery kingdom

  this morning mr remsden is to deliver an
address on this unique possession to the members of
the museum and other invited savants among
the guests will be the two visiting princes liu chi
and ten shin while prince liu chi when inter-
viewed last night at his hotel laughingly deprecated
any belief that the claw actually belonged to such
a mythical demigod he professed intense interest
in viewing it and listening to mr remsden

  modem china looks at such things as a modem
american might the relics of some indian cairn
said prince ten shin in corroboration of his cousins
attitude it is fitting that the most progressive
of nations should hold such an antiquity i under-
stand there are certain characters carven upon
the jade holder that may be of value to twentieth
century research from our standpoint we shall
certainly accept the invitation of the museum
authorities

  both princes speak english fluently and seem
entirely at home with our customs which they
have largely adopted

  this was a staggering thing and mcneill
mechanically folding up the paper emitted
so sharp a whistle that the passers-by
looked at him curiously but he paid no
heed to them

  how could remsden have presented the
claw to the museum when he mcneill
had given it over to tao chan as ransom
for the girl some jugglery had gone
on here-jugglery that increased the danger
to remsden and his stepdaughter to tlie
wth degree the visit of the two princes
could not be merely a coincidence their
liberalism was palpably a blind and their
real mission revealed they were after the
claw

 yet the claw was with tao chan it
could not be possible that remsden had
regained it he had literally fled from
peking it was almost absurd to think
there was another relic like it mcneill
was positive there was not even if there
was the possession of it-the gift of it to
the museum would be as deadly

 the interview did not ring true to
mcneill it might have been reported
correctly but what did an american news-
paperman know of the subtleties of the
ix

oriental mind no matter what story
remsden might have coined as to his
obtaining possession of the relic to exhibit
such an object of reverence to the princes
would be in their eyes little short of an
insult-a sacrilege they must surely know
all about what had happened at the temple

  while americans might think little of a
chinese museum having on show specimens
of early american culture or crudeness
the claw had been imbedded for unrecorded
centuries in the heart of all that was
chinese it was interwoven with the
very essence of ancestor worship it was
holy no american who had not lived
years in china could ever hope to see the
differences of thought in such an affair
the racial ideas of the two nations were
thousands of years apart even remsden
could not properly sense what mcneill felt

  now the claw was in the museum and
remsden in his blind pomposity was
elevated to the pinnacle he had been
willing to spend so much-to risk so much
-to obtain but in the eyes of the princes
for all their affectation of occidental ideas
remsden was a profaner of shrines a robber
of chinas holy of holies mcneill had
to admit that the museum must have the
claw though how this had happened was
a riddle hard to solve

  what would be the next move pon-
dered mcneill an attempt to get hold
of the claw or swift and horrible revenge
upon helen her stepfather and perhaps
himself if they knew of his presence in
new york

  mcneill strove to unravel what might
be in the minds of the two princes and then
he started north for the remsdens it
was vital that he should find out just what
had occurred-what remsden had done-
where the claw came from he wondered
whether helen had been present at the
reception the early evening editions came
out but there was nothing more in them
a wall street magnate had collapsed and
the market was in jeopardy the chinese
princes were eclipsed remsden forgotten

the east nineties reached and
the house located mcneill sent in
his card by a serving man who ele-
vated his eyebrows the slightest bit as he
pronounced the name and then ushering
mcneill into a reception room said-

  ill see if miss remsden is at home sir


adventure

  mcneill heard a door shut somewhere
down the hall then he caught faint
echoes of a voice he recognized as rems-
dens the man came back demurely
apologetic

  miss remsden is not at home sir
gone out of town for a few days mr
remsden said he would see you some other
time sir regretting that he is very busy
just now sir yes sir t thank you

  mcneill had done nothing to render the
man grateful and he went out to his still
waiting taxi a little hurt a great deal dis-
appointed and much more worried at
his hotel a note was awaiting him that had
been brought by special messenger it
read

dear mr mcneiil

  your flowers were beautiful and it was very
thoughttul of you to send them i hope i am going
to see you soon but father seems for some reason
opposed at present to your coming to the house

   i am sure however that there will soon come an
opportunity for thanking you in person better than
i can by this brief note

                     sincerely yours

helen remsden

  and the note was dated that afternoon
and superscribed-

this afternoon

                 at home

  so that is how the wind blows said
mcneill sotto voce the old boy thinks
ill bawl him out whatever yarn he puts
up about getting the claw for that im
to be lied to and refused admittance well
see about that i wonder if the fool thinks
he is not in actual danger

  he dressed for his lonely dinner for the
sheer pleasure of wearing clothes long for-
eign to him and the head waiter recog-
nizing an out-of-the-ordinary person in ins
appearance gave him a good table just the
right distance from the music and not far
from where the chinese princes were emi-
nently enjoying an occidental menu

  they were with a party of american men
and women the latter exploiting foreign
magnates to their own gratification no
one seemed to look his way and he lingered
over his own carefully chosen meal after
the eastern royalty had left his tip duly
impressed his waiter as did his word of
thanks for service the man lingered

  i beg your pardon sir he said but
the man who waited on them foreign chaps

wanted to find out your name of course
i didnt know it sir but-

  he could easily have got it i suppose

thanks

  ever been there sir china i mean
ive got a cousin in shanghai who sells
sewing-machines doing well too

  yes ive been there he should do
well reserve this table for me tomorrow
night will you

  yes sir

  so one of the princes or both had been
interested in him why mcneill cogi-
tated over that a long time that night
before he went to sleep and in the morn-
ing he fancied he began to see the answer

  the claw was to the fore in the papers
once more the museum had been broken
into some time between two and three
oclock only the vigilance of the special
watchmen had prevented serious vandalism
the intruders were masked only a glimpse
had been caught of them in the oriental
gallery where the claw of the dragon king
presented by the newly elected president
was deposited a protective agency man
felt-shod had seen the marauders bending
over the case in which the claw had been
placed he shouted and fired as the
burglars rushed for an open window from
which the netting had been removed two
other watchmen had rushed to his assist-
ance and a general alarm was turned in

  blood was found on the windowsill
showing that the bullet of the watchman
had been well aimed traces of a ladder
presumably of the extension variety were
found in the turf below the windows it
was said that a swift car had been seen
breaking the speed limits in the vicinity
of the museum the police believed they
had an important clew special precau-
tions were to be taken to safeguard the
curio

  prince liu chi could not be reached this
morning the paper stated having re-
tired but his secretary announced the
sincere regrets of both their highnesses at
the occurrence coupled with an expression
of thanks that the attempt had failed and
a hope that the robbers would be given over
to the justice of american law and order

  the telephone rang as mcneill was
reading over the article the second time
it was helen remsdens voice he recog-
nized

  can you come up here right away
the dragons claw



she asked and her voice quivered with
anxiety father is dreadfully upset and
wants to see you as soon as possible

  im starting now mcneill answered

  wants to make me his burden-bearer
once more i suppose mcneill told him-
self as he hastily finished his dressing
well im not going without breakfast
for his sake

chapter vii

the glove of velvet

something had surely happened to
howard remsden gone was his
attempt at patronizing mcneill gone
was his smug assurance the man seemed
to have shrunk like a balloon from which
enough gas has escaped to make the outline
flabby his florid complexion was blotched
and there were sagging pouches under his
eyes which themselves held a constant
appeal something had evidently fright-
ened remsden badly and he clung to
mcneills hand as would a despairing
swimmer to the rescuer

  mcneill was not particularly sorry for
him and he did not pretend to be it was
the request of helen remsden and the look
in her eyes that proclaimed him her cham-
pion that made him more than barely civil
to her stepfather moreover whatever peril
faced him included her for his own he
was not bothering just then

  i want you to read this first neill
said remsden i am not good at chinese
script as you know then ill tell you
everything they are after the claw

  he lowered his voice as a servant entered
the library where they were closeted a
magnificent room of carved paneling carved
furniture and gorgeous oriental hangings
and rugs

  the men have come about putting up
the bars sir said the servant the same
man who had refused mcneill permission
to see miss remsden the day before

  neill held nothing against him for obeying
orders-a flunkey must lie when his master
tells him he supposed--and today there
was a deference in the mans manner
toward the visitor that showed that he
was universally regarded in the remsden
household as the man of the hour

  tell em to begin with my bedroom and
miss remsdens jackson said remsden

im having the windows all barred he
said the house is otherwise protected
but one never knows

  the hands of the collector and new
president of the philological museum were
visibly trembling his cocksureness had
evaporated but mcneill could not resist
getting in one dig

  even in america he asked

  remsden reddened

  even in america he admitted there
are subtle forces at work mcneill i feel
them those two princes-

  he shuddered and passed the scroll of
ricepaper that had been fluttering in his
nervous hands across to mcneill

  i found this pinned to my coverlet
this morning he said pinned by this

  he took from a drawer of the massive desk
at which he was sitting a pin of soft gold
exquisitely carved in the shape of a dragon

  the imperial dragon he said six-
clawed how could it have come there
mcneill my servants might have been
bribed but they could not lie to me success-
fully and the door to my room was locked
and bolted  had locked the shutters of
my windows on the outside i had searched
my room before i went to bed i have
been all nerves lately-since yesterday
but there it was

  he went with dragging heels to a side-
board and helped himself to brandy and
soda offering some to mcneill who study-
ing the scroll refused with a shake of his
head

  want me to read it aloud he asked

remsden

  yes

  the hesitation in his voice was like that
of a prisoner about to hear a death warrant
mcneill studied over the hieroglyphs once
more

  this is a fairly exact translation he
premised

      time holds the eternal balances

     but man may weight the scales

     a maid and a flower-both are beautiful

     yet when the wind blows from the east

      lo they perish as straws in the furnace

 the wind-from the east-from
china groaned remsden the maid
that means helen

  there was a real note of anguish in his
voice that surprized mcneill he had not
thought that remsden was capable of
such genuine affection for the girl he
adventure

himself plainly understood the subtle threat
and his jaw set hard before he took up the
reading

who shall stay the hand of the reaper

only he who hath a clear conscience need not fear
   him

yet restitution may purge the soul

but the path of the perverse one shall be sown with
   knives

wo wo unto him who mocks the ghosts of a thou-
   sand generations

the gods are great-and awful is their vengeance
they strike and we see not whence comes the blow
nor when

neither do their hearts soften to the stubborn evil-
   doer

terror shall go down with him into the place of
   shadows

  well asked remsden what do you
make of it

  it is not time for me to talk yet said
mcneill i want some explanations from
you to save your stepdaughter from the
fanatic priests i took back the claw to
the temple not with any eagerness on
your part at that i saw the claw turned
over to the priest and i returned with
helen-with miss remsden now in new
york i read that you have presented the
claw to the museum and now for the
second time you tell me that she is in
jeopardy on account of it and on account
of your own infernal ambition he added
grimly

  now remsden you concealed from me
your first depredations from the temple
dont hide anything from me this time
i warn you that if your stepdaughters fife
hangs by a thread as i believe it does
yours is still closer to annihilation

  he saw in the dilated eyes of remsden
that he too realized this it was not
terror for liis stepdaughter as much as for
himself that had shaken him she was a
pawn seized in the game whose capture left
him the king open to attack

  now then mcneill went on is this
claw you have given the museum another
inferior specimen that somewhere you have
got hold of or is it a fake that you have
perpetrated after having to restore the
original and what cock-and-bull story
have you foisted off on the museum con-
cerning it if it is so while the princes
knowing the true claw safe and sound
have laughed at you and all america in
their oriental sleeves you have never-
theless exposed yourself as the man who

ravished their sacred shrine and now they
preshadow their revenge

  or is there something deeper what-
ever it is come clean with it helen
whom i love is in danger i am included
in all likelihood they tried to bowstring
me in california as for yourself your
death is certain unless intervention comes
and it will not be a pleasant death rems-
den for all your vaunt of new york police
protection for all your steel bars i am
the only one who might help you who
must help you for helens sake but you
must tell me the truth-the whole truth
and nothing but the truth

  remsden moistened his lips once more
he lowered his voice to a whisper took a long
sip of the brandy and water and glanced
fearfully about the room

  it is the original he said the claw
in the museum i mean

  mcneills jaw began to protrude and his
forehead to knit remsden hurried on
ill tell you everything mcneill its
due you in a way ill grant that of
course you came out all right there was
no chance of a slip and i offered you extra
compensation for the risk

when i told you in peking that
i didnt have the claw and couldnt
get it for two days it was because
i had entrusted it to a chinese jeweler
for duplication a wonderful craftsman
the only man in china i think who could
have copied it and you know what wonders
the orientals are at duplication i had to
pay him an enormous sum to overcome his
superstitions-almost as much as i paid
fung-ti in the first place-but he did it
he brought the two to me at the im-
perial-

  i saw the man said mcneill shortly
i thought you had referred it to him for an
opinion go on

  the facsimile was perfect i couldnt
have known them apart and i made the
closest examination i doubt if the old
craftsman himself would have known the
difference once they were juggled if i
hadnt taken the precaution to impregnate
the original with ambergris the perfume
sank into the jade and the claw and some
of it still clings the copy of course was
unscented

  he sat back with a glint of satisfaction
on his features at the cleverness he had
the dragons claw



shown but this faded at the sight of
mcneills face

  so you deliberately sent me back to
the hoang lung with a duplicate when
helens life was hanging in the balance
her honor the prospect of horrible degrada-
tion and torture all depended on it-not
to speak of my own safety or my own honor
i swore to tao chan that i had kept faith
with him remsden there are no words
that i am capable of to tell you what i
think of you-a man so besotted by his
own puny chance for fame that he

would-

  i tell you there was no chance of a slip
the two could not be told apart

  and what if i had been delayed upon
the trip your master-craftsman whose
dread you thought you had bought over
with your gold was still the slave of his
superstitions we met him hurrying to
hoang lung to confess to the trickery
i thought he was merely bearing the news
of the theft and laughed at the poor fool
he was death incarnate riding to our de-
struction twenty-four hours after he had
passed us tao chan knew what you had
done

  i wouldnt give the seed of a dried fig for
your life remsden for all your bars and
your protection you have deserved the
death of fung-ti in my estimation you
vile imitation of a pariah if it wasnt
that your dirty chicanery involved helen
i would beat you to a pulp and leave this
house in the sure knowledge that if you
dont die of heart failure from cowardice
it is because the gods they write of in this
script have reserved you for something more
appropriate in the way of punishment
he had risen and was towering over the
crumpled remsden who was whining in his
chair

  dont go back on me mcneill for
helens sake i did not dream of the
jewelers going to hoang lung

  the fives of the three of us are in
jeopardy yours is forfeit

  there must be some way out mcneill-
some way

  there is one chance-to make restitu-
tion of the claw it is possible they may
make terms-may keep them i can see
these two princes they have evidently
been communicated with by cable from
china for all their avowal of modem
thought they have still to play politick at

home i have reason to believe that they
can be treated with

  yes i think so but i cant give them
back the claw mcneill

  why not

  remsden gulped the rest of his liquor
a stubborn look was on his face

  because i cant and i wont ive
been upset a bit that paper and some-
thing that happened yesterday-but-

it this is america and bigger men than i
have been safeguarded for years against
greater perils ill-ill go to sea if
necessary and stay there i have my own
yacht ill take helen with me you can
come along too if you are so afraid of the
vengeance of tao chan or whatever his
name is but i wont give it up

  back of the mans bluster that yet was
not all bluff for it was backed by deter-
mination mcneiu read accurately the
reason for his stiffening he would not
sacrifice his own presidency so long coveted
in all probability it had been obtained by
his promise of the relic to the museum
such arrangements were not uncommon
to take back the claw would mean his
resignation an awkward explanation per-
haps making him the laughing stock of the
scientific world far rather would rems-
den sacrifice any one near and dear to him
even run the chance of death for himself

  i am not afraid said mcneill it is
quite possible that you may be able to safe-
guard yourself for a time but i am going
to do one tiling i am going to convince
prince liu chi and prince ten shin of the
absolute innocence of helen and myself
in this matter after that you can do as
you please if i cant convince them
i shall give out the true story of the claw

 ah-ha to whom the press do
you think they would believe you-take
the word of a penniless adventurer against
howard remsden i would say you were
attempting to blackmail me

  you would be very sorry if you did
remsden replied mcneill quietly very
sorry i assure you but there is no use
wrangling ill see the princes as for
yourself you seem to have changed your
attitude since i arrived it may be the
brandy or perhaps your nerves react
swiftly if i can get what i deem satis-
factory assurance from liu chi and ten
shin as to the safety of your stepdaughter
and myself why you can take your own
adventure

measures for protection they may be
quite sufficient if expensive good morn-
ing

  hold on a minute mcneill there is
no good wrangling as you say im getting
on a bit never used to know what nerves
were like you its indigestion thats
what it is but youll let me know how
you come out with the princes wont you

  neill reflected it would give him a good
reason for coming back-a chance to see
helen

  you said something happened yester-
day he said at the meeting when
you gave your address i suppose what
was it

  doubtless i exaggerated it said rems-
den

  the colossal conceit and egoism of
the man had already restored him from
the fright caused by the finding of the
paper pinned to his counterpane now a
shadow of fear was visible he hesitated

  it was awkward-unexpected he be-
gan i mean the presence in new york
of liu chi and ten shin then some of
the committee asked them to be present
and the press took it up it was em-
barrassing i had to change the talk
i had prepared in some measure

  remsden got fiery red under mcneills
shrewd look

  but it went off well enough until it came
to meeting the princes i say well enough
though i had felt all through my speech
that they were laughing at me-you know
what i mean mcneill those ivory faces
motionless the smooth lids that dont
open like a white mans they just slit apart
and you see their black eyes laughing at you
like mocking devils and when they
shook hands it was like touching the skin
of a snake

   hands across the sea thats what
liu chi said we are not so far apart
mr remsden after all that was a
threat all right-a touch of the velvet
glove nothing of the hatchetman method
about those two slick yellow devils mc-
neill and they smiled when they handled
the claw i had a wild idea that they
might try to claim it i would never
have made the presentation if i had known
of their presence in the country but they
just smiled with their eyes and gave it back
to forsythe our curator who was watching
them as he does every one even me with

the eyes of a hawk the gift belongs to
the museum and he is responsible every
one is a possible thief in his eyes

  i suppose commented mcneill that
all ancient curios may be styled stolen
goods the dead and their habitations
have been ravished of jewels temples of

their carvings and inscriptions-

  thats it exactly neill broke in
remsden thats the point of view you
must take science must not be judged
however by the rules applied to the living
i do not consider myself a thief but a-
a-

  a benefactor the sarcasm was lost
it was the way the prince said we are
not so far apart that impressed me
they are both in it they mean to get it
they were at the bottom of the attempted
robbery last night

   if it had been possible for the duplicated
claw to get across said mcneill they
might have made a shift that would
have eased matters but it would take
some powerful influence to make tao chan
let even the copy go the shrine has
worshipers and he will not let the common
people know of the substitution it would
spell peril for him to be without the
fetish

   but i will let you know the result of my
interview now for my own business
i would like to see miss helen i might
tell you that those affairs of mine are no
longer in the air they are being exploited
with ample capital and protection

  i am glad to hear it glad to hear it
i am sure wish you every success
remsden touched a bell tell miss helen
that mr mcneill would like to see her
jackson

mcneill found helen remsden
in her own parlor thankful that
she was not the type that required
reservations he told her frankly that there
was a certain menace concerning the claw
that her stepfather had fallen in her esti-
mation was evident she had thought the
present he had made to the museum was
merely a clever substitution and though
she said nothing as to the risk to which
they had been exposed at the hoang lung
temple her manner conveyed her opinion
of the man who had prompted it

  i think i can remove the menace said
mcneill but your father-
the dragons claw



  my stepfather she corrected point-
edly

  your stepfather must be made to return
the claw

  he will not do that she affirmed
he would have to degrade himself in his
own light the museum would have to
acknowledge having been deceived he
would lose his presidency

  i think there may be a way out said
mcneill i am to come again tomorrow
shall i see you

  certainly i shall be glad

  mcneill went off happily but he had
all his wits about him and he did not fail
to see a man who had been lounging at
the corner slouchingly follow neill had
dismissed his taxi and now he swung into
the park his shadow persisted and mc-
neill led him on at a smart pace turning
a corner abruptly and hiding behind some
shrubbery he saw the man go by and
saw also stamped on his skull-like face
the evidence of opium

  i shall have an interesting interview
with our oriental potentates i fancy
he told himself as he caught a bus to return
to his hotel

  his room was made up pinned to the
pillow-sham was a gold dragon six-clawed
made into a stick pin mcneill shrugged
his shoulders

  nothing small about their methods
he said aloud then deliberately removed
the pearl from the scarf and replaced it
with the emblem of the dragon-kmg

chapter viii

the hand of steel

the suites allotted to princes liu chi
and ten shin were costly according
their capaciousness running the full
length of one corridor of the famous new
york hostelry a private elevator was
part of the equipment and to this mcneill
having arranged his appointment was
ushered by the urbane secretary of the
imperial entourage that despite their
affectation of democracy still retained
the attributes of chinese aristocracy and
accompanying wealth

  a chines boy was elevator pilot and
once on the floor of the suite america
gave place to the flowery kingdom
there was no suggestion of anything

occidental save in the electric fixtures
disguised beneath oiled-silk lanterns and
the telephones either brought with them
or secured from new york oriental mer-
chants the furniture the rugs the hangings
-every detail were those of an imperial
apartment in the forbidden city

  the secretary in american clothes dis-
appeared in the ante-chamber and pres-
ently a giant chinaman whose silken garb
bore the insignia of the royal house ushered
mcneill into a room where liu chi and
ten shin arrayed in magnificent brocades
rose to meet him and bade him be seated
upon a lounge tapestried with sprawling
dragons

  mcneill still wore the dragon pin
dressed as he was for the morning appoint-
ment and a compact automatic was ready
to his hand it would not be hard to
dispose of him he reflected if he gave
them the chance he had come up in a
private elevator no one would know
when he went down if he ever did save a
chinaman his body could be smuggled
out in some trunk and got rid of quietly
mcneill was not morbid about this possi-
bility it was quite on the cards and he
prepared for it as best he could

  i expect an important call in some
fifteen minutes he said after the due
ceremonial of greeting had been gone
through would it be too much if it was
transmitted to me here

  liu chi smiled and gave orders in his own
language to that effect

  to what do we owe the pleasure of this
visit mr mcneill we have heard that
you have visited our country have in fact
lived there for several years that is inter-
esting you will realize for one thing
the difficulty of assimilation that besets
a land like ours in taking up occidental
thought and ideas when my countrymen
are so steeped with ignorance and super-
stition but we must do the best we can

  the idea of these two imperious beings
bred of a thousand years of despotic
measure being seriously inclined to sim-
plicity of any sort that bespoke equality
struck mcncill as absurd it would take
many generations for china to become a
true republic liu chi and ten shin
were merely going with the current and
taking good care of themselves mean-
while he decided to match oriental
guile with yankee-irish bluntness of attack
adventure

  i have come here to tell you a straight
tale he commenced and recited omitting
no detail the history of the claw from the
time he had first met remsden and at-
tracted by helen agreed to act as guide
and interpreter through it all the two
princes sat like statues immutable their
eyes only shown by narrow bars of glitter-
ing jet between their narrowed lids so
did the imperial mandarins sit in justice
at the close ten shin started to exchange
a few words with his cousin but mcneill
interrupted

  i understand the mandarin dialect
he said

  ten slain and liu chi gravely nodded
an acknowledgment

  that is very honorable of you said
the latter and honor does not dwell in
unclean places

  but for all their politeness mcneill
believed the tiling had been a test anyway
he had scored

  your tale is well told said liu chi
yet we can not think why you should
think us especially interested the mu-
seums of england of france of all coun-
tries hold relics of past races our own
country has long been overrun by con-
querors it is the most polyglot of nations
of mixed blood mixed faiths the old
order changeth yielding place to new as
tennyson writes and we my cousin and
myself are of the new order

  we can not hold any responsibility for
mr remsdens emotions the hoang
lung is a far-reacliing organization linked
by mysticism as it is it is possible that
some of their members may have attempted
to threaten mr remsden and play upon
his fears but of a surety we do not wish
the claw we were curious to see it yes
but there our interest ceases we came
here for things concerning this generation
and those to come mr mcneill long
before mr remsden visited the temple of
hoang lung you must be aware of that

  you seem to make it very plain that
neither miss remsden nor yourself were
implicated in this matter or in the sub-
stitution i sincerely trust that if any
members of the hoang lung are in doubt
as to this they may be convinced before
they carry out any threats if they so
intend

  mcneill listening to the smooth syllables
with all the difficult rs sounded perfectly

knew that liu chi was lying but he could
do nothing they also thought that he had
lied concerning the innocence of helen
and himself in the affair or they did not
care ten shin took up the talk

  we can not pretend to influence such
of our countrymen who may still cling
to superstition he said we have de-
liberately severed ourselves from such
we shall hope of course to teach them
better in time we are sorry we can do
nothing for you glad to have listened to
you we would suggest that for mr
remsdens peace of mind he might open
up negotiations for the return or exchange
of the claw speaking merely as those having
knowledge of the workings of the chinese
trend of thought one unfortunate national
characteristic of ours is revenge particu-
larly when allied to faiths however loosely
foimded

  you evidently from the style of the
communication conveyed to mr remsden
have to do with a clever mentality i
would suggest that any reprisal that might
be intended would be divided into two
parts-punishment and insistence upon the
return of the true relic as long as mr
remsden seems the key the only key to
that return so long will he be safe from
punishment as to the reference to miss
remsden speaking again from the general
understanding of my more bigoted and
ignorant countrymen i fear i greatly
fear that even if we could interfere it
would be too late

  just exactly what do you mean asked
mcneill

  the absolutely unemotional even pro-
nunciation like drops of water falling on
the bar of a xylophone the mask-like faces
the atmosphere of the room with its dim
lights masked windows a hint of incense
had gradually chilled him these men
were pitiless

  mr remsden was warned yesterday

  then helen had been already struck in
some mysterious way mcneills fingers
gripped his automatic his muscles tensed

  a telephone sounded

  your call i think mr mcneill

  he had asked helen to call him partly
to assure her that he was working in her
interests partly as a bluff to the princes
his spirit lightened as he heard her
voice

  and i suppose i have you to thank for
the dragons claw

the magnificent roses she was saying
you mustnt be so extravagant

  it was not i he answered but ill
see you this afternoon

  he hung up the receiver in relief he was
certain that the two princes were watching
him covertly as cats might watch a mouse
but helen was safe despite their covert
threats

  again he tried the direct method

  if i succeed in getting mr remsden
to relinquish the claw he said could
i count upon your influence to have the
news transmitted to those most inter-
ested-to tao chan for example

  you may be assured mr mcneill
that we will do all that we can for your
own warning if you so regard the pin you
found on your pillow we can hardly better
recommend you than to the wonderful
protective methods of your great city
many of which we hope to ultimately adopt
or adapt before we leave we hope to
give a banquet to those with whom we have
come in close contact may i hope that
you will be present

rjs dismissed down in the private
elevator and back into america
again mcneill went chagrined to his
own room he knew that he had failed
that he had touched only the shell of the
consciousness of the princes not one
shade of doubt of surprize of anger or
pity not one atom of any emotion had they
shown he might as well have spoken
to the lacquered images in the temple at
hoang lung but from that minute he
would watch the safety of helen she
must be made to understand her danger
the infinite sarcasm of his reception
burned within him he had been as im-
potent as a small boy blowing bubbles at
the feet of the great statue of buddha at
laiting

  he was before his time at the remsden
residence but helen was expecting him
the roses she had spoken of were in a tall
vase of metal-gorgeous american beauty
roses several feet tall

  the most exquisite royal things she
said and the thorniest but you have
to pay for them by the length of the stem
i understand i thought they were from
you and i was going to scold you for the
pricks i got in arranging them

  i wish i had thought of them said

mcneill regretfully and i am very
sorry for the damaged fingers was thee
no card with them

 no i looked carefully but they
came from your hotel

  mcneill looked thoughtful for a moment
i have promised to see your father
before i go he said i failed to convince
the princes they pleaded lack of interest
and in almost the same breath emphasized
the threat you have got to be careful
of your comings and goings helen promise
me that you will

  she noted his first free use of her name
as she blushed and then answered

  very well neill what do you suggest

chapter ix

the white death

the next day the princes went to wash-
ington by invitation to see the sights
of the capital city their suite was still
reserved but mcneill breathed a little
more easily the menace hanging over
helen seemed less imminent though he
could neither dismiss nor fathom the sug-
gestion of ten shin that it had already fal-
len and it had been an assertion rather than
a suggestion but the days went by and she
appeared as blooming as ever while rems-
den himself completely regained his poise

  no national president was better safe-
guarded than was he night and day the
protection extending to his stepdaughter
he no longer affected to hold mcneill at a
distance the irishmans polite covering
of the contempt in which he held remsden
may have enraged him but it also forced
him to at least an equal politeness as a lion
will go through tricks it hates from fear of
the tamer and his whip

  there were few allusions to the claw
twice mcneill urged remsden to do some-
thing toward the restoration of the claw
to communicate with the princes at their
hotel in washington but confident in the
power of his little army of protectors he
stubbornly refused to discuss the question

  it was a week after the departure of
liu chi and his cousin that helen made a
complaint that struck fear into the heart
of mcneill ever alert for danger against
the girl he loved and who he had reason to
believe returned his love in the shadow
that he still feared hung over them all he


adventure

had not spoken to her openly but there
were a hundred signs that cheer even
despairing lovers and mcneill was far from
being despondent

  he had definitely made up his mind to
force remsdens hand upon the princes
return scheduled for the tenth day after
they left for washington their banquet
had been set for the following evening and
all new york especially that part of its
social center that had not been invited
was agog over the rumored extravagance
of the affair

  it was to be an arabian nights enter-
tainment it was said there would be
magic wrought in more ways than one
and all the fabled magnificence of aladdins
gardens would fade before the spectacle
of the feast to be spread in the private suite
of their imperial highnesses as the society
columns still secretly delighting in titles
styled these two chinamen who claimed to
be representatives of a new republic
guests had been asked to attend in oriental
garb and all the glamour of a fancy-dress
affair fascinated the fashion-writers and
stimulated the curiosity and envy of those
not fortunate enough to receive invitations

  remsden rather in fear than bravado
mcneill thought had accepted for himself
and helen and neill himself had likewise
signified his intention of being present
helen and he were discussing costumes
when she presented her finger for his
inspection

  it is numb neill she said first
it was the upper joint and now it is the
second-the same finger i pricked so badly
with those roses  thought you sent me
i cant bend it between those twt joints at
all look at it

  as mcneill took the tapering finger a
strange fear gripped his heart the men-
tion of the roses seemed to have promoted
the presentiment helens hand was white
well kept the texture of a gardenia petal
though the tips showed the faint rose-hue
of perfect health the index finger of the
right hand was the one she complained
about and mcneill noticed that it was
subtly different from the rest

  he could bend it between the first and
second joints but there was no reflex action
the nail lacked color and the pinkness of
the tip was entirely missing the flesh
was unshriveled but it had a frozen look
it was like a finger carved in alabaster

a finger of galatea with all the rest of the
beautiful statue come to life

  a tiny light-brown speck marked where
the sharp thorns of the american beauties
had punctured the skin and drawn blood
there was a smaller mark lower down
made in the same way he strove to hide
his premonition he dared not gaze into
her face though presently he would have
to force himself to that inspection he knew
quite well

  how long have you noticed this he
asked

  since the morning after the thorns
pricked me she answered i thought
nothing of it but it has steadily grown
worse i asked dr hastings about it and
he thought there might be some slight local
infection but it has not swelled it has
simply lost all sensation he didnt seem
to consider it very serious it is my sewing
finger and i do sew occasionally she
laughed so i have noticed it

  by the way asked mcneill casually
though he made a strong effort to control
his voice you never found out who sent
you those roses

  no-no one has claimed the honor
youare quite sure you didnt leave a stand-
ing order neill it would be like you
quite sure i wouldnt worry about
this if i were you it will probably pass
oh i wont worry about it it is
probably a matter of circulation ill have
to be more careful of my diet and cut off
candy i suppose

  neill laughed with her and then de-
liberately forcing back all emotion he pro-
ceeded to the test he dreaded

  wont you play something he asked
steadying his voice

  she went over to the piano and neill
made a point of choosing something that she
must play by note to aid her in this he
turned on the piano lights and then settled
himself in a chair that gave him a good
view of her face turning it as she did
occasionally toward him to the ordi-
nary observer there would have seemed
nothing out of the ordinary save that the
face was very fair to look upon with its
perfect oval the scarlet lips and the steady
large eyes beneath curving delicately pen-
ciled brows it was at these latter that
neill directed his closest attention though
he managed to hide it from her smiling
when he met her gaze
the dragons claw



ppji when he left her that night his
oja nails had cut deeply into his palms

        the cowards he said the
curs and there is no remedy

  at the hotel he made discreet inquiries
at the flower stand-inquiries sped by a
jovial talk and augmented with a liberal
tip he traced the flowers there had
been no special attempt to hide their source
save from the lack of a card-a matter
easily explained by blaming an underling
secretary who would shoulder the responsi-
bility in case of inquiry they had been
ordered by the secretary of the two chinese
princes a not too unusual compliment
from the distinguished foreigners to the
daughter of the president of the museum
whose soiree they had attended and who
had been placed on the list of guests at their
banquet

  the flowers and their deadly thorns had
faded and long since been cast away not
to be recovered

  but they had accomplished their purpose
achieved the deadly end of the fiends who
had sent them how had the chinese
scribe written

a maid and a flower-both are beautiful

yet when the wind blows from the east

lo they perish as straws in the furnace

 the wind had blown from the east
helen was doomed doomed with the
living death the white death of china-
leprosy

  mcneill had suspected it in the numbing
thorn-pricked finger had confirmed it in
the slight but unmistakable leonine cast
of her brows a suggestion of furrows and
puffed flesh that is one of the symptoms
of the disease leprosy was infectious
and the thorns had been impregnated by
the deadly virus- the evidence was de-
stroyed but the girl was sentenced to a loath-
some ever encroaching dissolution from
which there was no cure only a horrible
segregation under the law

 black murder welled up in mcneill
but he forced it down remsden was the
one to blame primarily and he too would
be hard hit for neill felt that he loved
his stepdaughter as for the orientals
they had been hit and they had struck
back according to their lights and helen
his clear brain reeled for a few moments
as he contemplated the awful fate ahead of
her-a fate that he determined to share

as nearly as he would be allowed yet
there must be should be a reckoning
first doctors must be privately consulted
helen must be persuaded to see them on
some pretext the stiffening of her finger
the lack of circulation but she must not be
allowed to suspect it would drive a girl
of her vitality her love of life her sensitive-
ness insane

   for himself he could only determine one
course he could bluff up some evidence
confront the princes to what definite
avail he knew not but he must find some
vent for his own overmastering fury at the
unfair blow and remsden should not be
spared his selfish pride should be humili-
ated the claw should be returned per-
haps-

chapter x

mcneill

mcneill had gone up in the private
elevator by sheer force of arms
hiding behind portieres he had seized the
moment when a visitor descended from the
suites of liu chi and ten shin on the night
of their coming back from washington
waited until the man had disappeared and
the chinese operator lounged waiting for a
call and then he had come out shoved the
muzzle of his gun against the chinamans
blouse and ordered him to ascend

  the secretary met him at the top and
to him mcneill applied the same treatment
his lean face bossed with muscles from his
set jaws aided the imagination of the secre-
tary who walked before him death joggling
his ribs into the anteroom and so into the
reception room where the two princes sat
this time they were in conventional evening
dress their faces strangely incongruous in
the setting

   mcneill faced them with a crisp demand
for an audience

  certainly assented liu cm with the
-briefest glance at his cousin but there
was there is no need for violence mr
mcneill you can put that pistol away
we are quite adequately protected

   that is where you are mistaken said
neill mcneill i do not represent vio-
lence only force and that is quite necessary
and i am amply backed i do not give a
poppy petal for my own life at the present
moment he wtent on speaking in the


adventure

mandarin dialect save as it may accom-
plish an end and if it is wiped out there
are others who possess the actual evidence
i am about to present to you

  again there was that hint of a look the
swift shuttling of agate eyes but the
princes said nothing

  i do not know how intimate you have
become with the workings of american
justice- neill went on his voice as cold
as ever theirs had sounded-the justice
that you spoke of adapting to your own
new republic but there is such a thing
as international law and you have made the
mistake of supposing mr remsden to be
purely a private citizen without influence
at washington you can easily assure
yourselves of this mistake by discussion
with your embassy i am very certain he
has a great deal of power

  you affect to disdain the matter of the
claw in your affectation of new chinese
policies which you are forced to adopt by
the trend of the times in china you are
particularly anxious not merely to remain
upon good terms with the united states
and her allies but also to negotiate a loan
of considerable magnitude this has not
been made public and my knowledge of it
should show you that i have not been idle
and that mr remsden from whom i ob-
tained the information is in touch with
international affairs

  you sent some roses to miss remsden
i have the full evidence you will be held
responsible for the actions of your secretary
despite any denial he may make the
thorns were impregnated with the virus of
leprosy which was communicated to miss
remsden as you hoped by the pricking
of her hand those thorns have been sub-
jected to analysis not thrown away as
you expected i know the symptoms of
leprosy

  to that and the fact that the virus was
so strong as to bring out swiftly those
symptoms is due uie fact that the roses
were rescued in time your rank may keep
you from imprisonment but your failure
to make the loan the general loathing and
suspicion that will be cast upon all chinese
diplomacy and personality will not serve
to make you popular with your govern-
ment the evidence is in the hands of our
secret service or will be turned over to
them either upon my order or in case i do
not leave these rooms unscathed or am in

any way interfered with i have spoken
mcneill stopped talking unable to tell
from those impassive masks what effect his
powerful indictment had made it was
largely bluff remsden did have influence
and the wires had been busy ever since
he had disclosed to remsden the state of
his daughters health but they had been
unable to recover the roses still the cards
were hidden and the stakes were big

  we will converse in english answered
ten shin imperturbably you have de-
livered your tirade mr mcneill if such
a misfortune has overtaken miss remsden
we can understand your feelings and those
of her father powerless as we may be to
avert them

  remsden is not her father said
mcneill no blood of his is in her veins
and she is innocent of any complicity in his
affairs

  she is not his own daughter

  no

  there was silence for several moments
the two princes seemed to be in some
occult way transferring thoughts

  you play a good game mr mcneill
said liu chi at last and you place
your cards on the table but they are not
face up and some of them may be spurious

i may say without prejudice to our own
disclaimer in this matter that the question
of chinese vengeance lies largely in the
permanent punishment of offenders even
to the third and fourth generation the
fact that miss remsden is not of howard
remsdens own blood is i should imagine
quite a factor it is a pity it was not
known before-to tao chan for example

  as for your threats against us we will
dismiss them as quite natural under the
circumstances it is true that china is
anxious through all her representatives
to stand well with america to prove to
your people that we are not utter bar-
barians that we can even look at things
from the same standpoint of humanity
the principles upon which your country is
so deeply founded

  if you with mr remsden and miss
remsden will attend the banquet to-
morrow evening-twenty-four hours will
not alter the medical situation-we may be
able to assist you we shall expect mr
remsden to come half-way we accept no
responsibility in this we act merely as
mediators we can understand that mr
the dragons claw



remsden wishes to as we say in china
save his face we can perhaps arrange
that also

  you will convey our sentiments to mr
remsden for yourself chinese doctors
have long been held up to the ridicule of
the western pharmacopoeia as believers in
charms users of strange ingredients such
as those mentioned by the witches in
macbeth there may be merit in these
things all diseases of the body are not
cured in the body we are expecting a
notable guest with us he holds great
merit as a herbalist though that is not his
profession you shall meet him and
remember-for every virus there is a
serum-not always generally known as yet
but we orientals have our secrets we
can not prolong this interview we have
an appointment

  he clapped his hands and the secretary
appeared

  show in the gentlemen ordered liu
chi

   mcneill hope affecting him like a palsy
found himself acknowledging introductions
to several americans some of whom he
thought he knew soon he found himself
on the ground floor his hope growing
could it be that the chinese had found a
cure for leprosy

chapter xi

the fortune teller

the banquet that was to be the talk of
new york for many a day had pro-
gressed with wonderful eclat the costumes
of the guests the elaborately bizarre
decorations the strange music the unusual
dishes spiced with a bountiful supply of
occidental vintages the courtesy of the
hosts the exotic atmosphere-all had made
the affair a success from the start rare
souvenirs not to be pricedhad augmented
the entente cordiale

  with the cessation of gastronomies came
an entertainment of wizardry of parlor
acrobatics of indoor fireworks until the
bewildered beholders were brought to the
tiring point

  then at the sound of a gong a booth
was brought in-a hooded tent of silken
brocades and ten shin arose

  much of which you have so courteously
shared with us tonight he said belongs

to the past-the passing china soon we
hope to be revivified with lessons learned
from american ingenuity and advancement
but there is one element that always
appeals particularly to the fair sex that
element is the future a member of our
little embassy has arrived today from china
bringing important matters and while he
has been too fatigued from his long and
accelerated journey to join us he has con-
sented to give some manifestation of his
skill as a diviner

  there was a murmur of anticipatory
delight and again the gong sounded
from behind high curtains four chinamen
dressed in vivid emerald silk brought
forward a palanquin of brightest scarlet
lacquer on which were illuminated golden
dragons in raised and lustrous metal work
six-clawed they were noted mcneill tense
with the sense of something pregnant
this they placed by the tent and disap-
peared

  a weird chant high pitched nerve
thrilling came from unseen musicians
the shrill piping of the chinese clarionet
and the twang of the gekken the room
was very quiet and the lights grew gradually
dim then the scarlet curtains of the
palanquin glowed fiery red faint streaks of
fight appeared through the folds of the tent
and a figure emerged from the carriage
it was clad in silk of the vividest yellow
and the robes mcneill noticed as his fingers
gripped those of helen next to him were of
priestly cut the figure was squat in
its rotundity it might have been ludicrous
save for a certain dignity that emanated
from it and because of that of the two
princely hosts the face projecting from
the folds of the hood was that of a turtle-
was that of tao chan high-priest of the
hoang lung

  mcneill was not surprized but he
marked the effort helen made to suppress
her feelings of astonishment and perhaps
of terror though there was as he assured
her no fear of anything out of the way
happening there with so many american
guests present yet there was something
that thrilled him with a sense of hidden
power-of mystery he glanced at rems-
den remsden was staring at tao chan
as he might have looked at a basilisk his
eyes projecting his lower jaw sagging

  tao chan had evidently arrived with
the duplicate leaving some excuse or


adventure

perhaps a second replica behind him this
one was to be exchanged for the original
everybodys face was to be satfed helen
by chinese drugs to be cured remsden
to be left as president and relieved of his
damoclean fate only the museum would
suffer and be none the worse for it thought
mcneill knowing other spurious objects
venerated there as real

  he neill mcneill had brought this
about by taking advantage of chinas
position as the sick man of asia looking
to america for aid the princes had come
with a dual purpose-to get the claw and
to establish friendly relations which cause
they held the greater mcneill did not
venture to imagine he did not care
feeling certain that the evening would see
the end of their troubles unless remsden
proved obstinate in this case mcneill
promised himself that he would devise a
little pressure on his own account

   ten shin turned to the ladv on his right
would you read the future he asked
her i am sure that for you it will be
rosy

   tao chan had entered the little tent and
taken his seat before a stand of dark wood
the legs formed of writhing dragons there
was a dish in front of him

   you will not be spirited away i assure
you went on the prince i will not
guarantee that you will not be enchanted
but turn about is fair play

  the guest laughed nervously at his
raillery but consented to enter the tent
the curtains closed and there was only
a low murmur to be heard drowned largely
by the rising notes of the orchestra in
less than two minutes the woman came out
 your wizard is a flatterer prince she
said i wish i could believe half he
promised though he does not speak very
good english

  he has learned it for the occasion
said ten shin gravely

  liu chi next asked his dinner partner
and she disappeared mcneill could hear
the first visitant answering questions

   i cant describe it she replied wait
till your turn he showed me a funny plate
first and then-i dont remember really
what happened it was all over so quickly
but he told me a lot of strange things that
might come true i hope so

  chinese hypnotism whispered mcneill
to helen under cover of the chatter he

read her own wishes it will be your turn
next dont be afraid it is going to help
us i can guess what they are after

   at liu chis request helen went into the
 booth remaining there a little longer than
 the rest when she came out she was
 pale and mcneill handed her a glass of
 wine

  dont talk now he said tell us
later

  she nodded brightly at him

   it sounded like good news she said

   some of the fairer guests refused others
 accepted and the novelty began to wane
 tao chan pleaded or pretended to plead
 exhaustion and withdrew in the palanquin
 then the lights went up ten shin arose
 with a toast to the united states and
 another orchestra typically american
 broke spiritedly into the star spangled
 banner the brilliant assemblage rose
 as the strains died liu chi made his
 peroration

   heliogabalus he said smothered his
 guests to death with rose petals tonight it
 is my cousin and myself who are smothered
 with your good-will but not to death
 and though roses grow in china we have a
 more typical flower that bears the charm of
 sweet forgetfulness-the faculty of dream-
 less sleep the lotus may its petals
 bring to all ofyou that boon to end the
 night

  the canopy above the table divided
and a shower of fragrant blossoms fell
while all the room was filled with mystical
perfume laughing congratulating the
guests departed the princes standing to bid
them farewell

  we shall see you once more before
we leave i hope said ten shin to mcneill
and helen then as they passed on he
touched remsden on the arm

   a word with you sir he said pleas-
 antly and envious guests marked remsden
 as one given spacial favors

 the two waited for remsden in
the anteroom he came to them
at last with the face of one who has
seen his own ghost-his features twisted
like a man who has suffered a stroke all
the way back to the limousine he did not
speak but plucked clumsily at his own
fingers at the house he achieved speech
with an effort as if his lingual muscles had
suffered paralysis
the dragons claw



  neill and i will join you when you have
taken off your wraps helen he said

  she looked anxiously at him and then
nodded

  in the drawing-room she replied

  the men went into the library remsden
poured brandy and gulped it down then
he sank into the cushions of a big chair
like a man of ninety

  what is the matter with helen neill
he asked thickly

  leprosy answered mcneill bluntly
remsden clawed at the arms of the chair
gasping for breath and speech

  my god he said i never thought-
ten shin said-he said that-as a bruised
plum is to a rotten fruit as a stained pearl to
a bowl of slime so should my punishment
be compared to hers oh my god neill

  brace up snapped mcneill what
else did he say about the claw

  i am to show it him at the museum
tomorrow-tao chan i mean he is to
handle it the princes will be there
we-we may adjust matters i do not
know i can not trust them i must see
helen

  mcneill guessed what the adjustment
would be a little legerdemain such as
wilson had shown in the desert this time
with tao chan as the prestidigitator
but had remsden already been inoculated
how was he to be cured and helen

  there are various degrees of leprosy
of course he said do you fancy that
you are already infected

  remsden nodded

  i know it he groaned something
pricked my palm when i shook hands
with ten shin and he smiled when i
started but helen-helen has an anti-

dote i shall receive one tomorrow

after-

  the claws are exchanged supplied
mcneill let us go into the drawing-
room

  they found the girl waiting and mcneill
answering a plea in remsdens eyes put
the question to her

  what happened in the tent i can
imagine that tao chan hypnotized you
and questioned you by so doing he
could confirm my statement to the princes
of your innocence in the stealing and sub-
stitution of the claw but what did he say
that you remember

  why he told me that i had been suffering
from some trouble with my hands but
that i should soon be entirely well again
he gave me this

  she showed a tiny phial of gray jade
wonderfully carven in the shape of a dragon
and stoppered with a dragons claw of gold
that held a tiny ball of crystal within
were some pellets of dull orange color

  these are to be taken one every hour
she said dissolved in hot water i have
already taken one and i can feel a tingling
in my numb finger

  she held it out for inspection remsden
looked at it with a shudder

  and he said that mr remsden was in
danger of sickness that was to be averted
by the medicine that he tao chan would
give him tomorrow are you to see him
tomorrow

  yes answered remsden thank
god i am good night you two good
night

  they watched him leave the room feeble
bowed a man old before his time

  then youth turned to youth
   our camp-fire came into being may   with our june issue and since then
its fire has never died down many have gathered about it and they are of all classes
and degrees high and low rich and poor adventurers and stay-at-homes and from all
parrs of the earth some whose voices we used to know have taken the long trail
and are heard no more but they are still memories among us and new voices are
heard and welcomed

   we are drawn together by a common liking for the strong clean things of out-of-
doors for word from the earths far places for man in action instead of caged by cir-
cumstance the spirit of adventure lives in all men the rest is chance

   but something besides a common interest holds us together somehow a real com-
radeship his grown up among us men can not thus meet and talk together without
growing into friendlier relations many a time does one of us come to the rest for facts
and guidance many a close personal friendship has our camp-fire built up between
two men who had never met often has it proved an open sesame between strangers
in a far land

   perhaps our camp-fire is even a little more perhaps it is a bit of leaven working
gently among those of different station toward the fuller and more human understand-
ing and sympathy that will some day bring to man the real democracy and brotherhood
he seeks few indeed are the agencies that bring together on a friendly footing so many
and such great extremes as here and we are numbered by the hundred thousand now

   if you arc comc to our camp-fire for the first time and find you like the things we
like join us and find yourself very welcome there is no obligation except ordinary
manliness no forms or ceremonies no dues no officers no anything except men and
women gathered for interest and friendliness your desire to join makes you a member

as unde frank huston has put it to
press-agenting of course he was press-
agented even his best friends must admit
that but whether it was to a degree that
really affected the validity of his claim to
came is another matter and i dont believe
we want to start another drannan discus-
sion at camp-fire

elyria ohio

    i have just been reading about custer buffalo
bill and calamity jane there has been so much
bunk written and told concerning custer reno
buffalo bill etc that i thought it might be that
you would like to read a more truthful account con-
cerning those men

    my regiment the th u s infantry was ordered
into the fight where custer fell but the order being
counlcrmanded the th cavalry custers com-
mand was ordered into the fight while the th
infantry were detailed to guard the wagon-train
reno was not to blame for the massacre of custer
and his men for reno obeyed custers orders as
well as he could under the circumstances while
custer disobeying his own orders caused the
deaths of himself and his men custer had been

come more testimony concerning the
 custer massacre from a comrade who
was formerly of the  th infantry which
barely missed being in the fight itself

  what dr arnold said about buffalo
bill was mild enough in tone but well
takes the general point of view that to a
certain degree buffalo bills fame was due
the camp-fire	

vvamed for days before that the indians were out
in very great numbers but paying no attention
to his scouts he ordered reno to go down the
little big horn a ways cross over and after
circling around to the back of the indians camp
to fire a signal shot upon which custer and his
men were to charge upon the camp from the front
custer however bull-headed as ever never waited
for reno to get back of the camp and fire the signal
shot but dashed right in when as chief gall said
when showing a party over the field in  the
indians were as thick as the leaves of the forest
springing up from the ground and in lots of in-
stances clubbing the cavalrymen off from their horses

uster went into the fight with long hair all
stories to the contrary and it is no doubt all
bosh about his having committed suicide he was
certainly killed by either rain-in-the-face or some
other indian it was a massacre all right for
their carbines were mostly fastened to their saddles
and their horses breaking away they were left
with only a few carbines about a half dozen sabers
and their revolvers with which to defend them-
selves

  in the meantime reno and his men were sur-
rounded on a hill by indians and the th infantry
and a small outfit of cavalry the th if i remember
right rescued reno and his men afterward the
th infantry and the th cavalry helped to bury
custer and his men reno would have been wiped
out with his men if they had not been rescued just
in time

guffalo bill used to scout with my regiment
and  i used to know calamity jane calamity
jane was certainly a very noted woman she was
full of life and vigor and when she looked at a
person her eyes would almost bore holes through
them-dr william e arnold formerly musi-
cian co b th infantry u s a

a word from harold a lamb in con-
nection with his story in this issue

  a few points about said afzels elephant it
may seem improbable that three men could do
what abdul dost and bis friends tackled in india
at that time however a noble from the court trav-
eled with a large following of slaves personal
attendants eunuchs wives buffoons liafis or
poem-readers bearers etc

pew of such gentry were fighting men by inclina-
tion or training and even today the hillmen
of afghanistan such as the afridis are excellent
combatants when so inclined at that time tribal
warfare was the rule and the hillmen were skilled
in weapons they had to be

  as to said afzel the character of the opium-
using poet is not overdrawn drugs of varied sort
were in general use and it was the fashion to remaiff
stupefied for certain lengths of time the rajputs
were addicted to opium in very large quantities
one passage in the memoirs of baber relates tnat
he kept sober at a drinking party of his friencis in
order to see what the bout world be like he
watched them drink wine then change to bhang
and distilled spirits ending up with ooium and
more wine until they became senseless or began

 

to commit all manner of follies whereupon i had

a good deal has been written of the treasure
of the moghuls this was hardly so very
great in money but consisted of enormous quan-
tities of jewels especially diamonds and rubies
horses cloth-of-gold etc the amount of an

men he could buy hence the possession of a store
of riches as in this story was more valuable to an

thanks to our comrade ira a thomp-
son of el paso i have a copy of poi-
sonous animals of the desert by charles
t vorhies which is bulletin no  of the
agricultural experiment station college
of agriculture university of arizona
tucson arizona the bulletins timely
hints and reports of this station will be
sent free to all who apply among other
things it seems to give us a final and
authoritative decision on our old old
friend the gila monster it is poisonous
but the effects ol its bite are variable and
there seems to be no established case of
the death of a hun an being from its bite

  here is mr thompsons letter

el paso texas

  in your issue of august th you list  kinds of
rattlesnakes

  as arizona  the home of j kinds i take-the
liberty to send you lins booklet issued by arizona
state university wtn n state there are  known
varieties of rattlesnakes  of which inhabit
u s a and  of these art found in arizona
my  colt single-action i you please has
finished many a rattler

  re coral snake a mexican woman at a mine
about  miles south of the line lived abou-  or
 minutes after being bitten by coral snake

  you will also find something about mr gila
monster nothing like the bunk one sometimes
reads in stories nor for that matter is it much like
the stuff i have handed out to entertain some of
the new comers who as a rule will believe the lies
but not the truth-ika a thompson

  and here is a quotation from the bul-
letin

  just one other poisonous reptile belongs to our
fauna-the gila monster heloderma suspectum
cover cut this and a closely related species
heloderma horridum found only in mexico are
the only poisonous lizards in the world abso-
lutely no other lizards these including the so-called
horned toad are poisonous the gila mon-
ster has dois -glands but in the lower instead
a he upper jaw the secretion oozing out between
the teeth and the lower ups it has no poison
fang however and therefore no definite mechan-
ism for j-dbly injecting poison with a stroke as
does the rattlesnake it will snap and bite if
adventure



irritated and will cling like a bulldog when it gets
hold and poison may enter the wounds made by
its numerous small sharp teeth as a result of the
tenacious grip of the animal

the effects of its bite are variable owing doubt-
less to the impcrfect application of the venom-
ous saliva though some reports have it that
human deaths have resulted from the bite of this
animal these reports arc but hearsay and fade away
to nothing upon investigation the writer is in-
debted to a reputable physician of tucson who has
made considerable effort to authenticate a single
case of death caused by the gila monster and has
failed to do so an exhaustive report on the
venom of hcloderma by leo loeb published
by the carnegie institution as well as the re-
searches of other investigators shows that the
venom produces fatal results in various small ani-
mals such as rats mice frogs guinea pigs etc
as to effects on man we find no local data to dis-
countenance the following statement from loebs
report

 njo death of a human being has come to our
knowledge that can be attributed to the bite
of a gila monster a bite from this animal is in
man cither followed by no symptoms at all or by
a local swelling perhaps extending to the shoulder
if the bite affected the upper extremity in
all the reports concerning the local effect of the
bite of the ileloderma in man mention is made
of the rapid appcarancc of swelling and hcm-
morrhagic discoloration of the skin at the site of
injury we found that when fresh venom was
injected subcutaneously into an animal no swelling
or hemorrhage appeared at the site of injection
and when venom was injected intramuscularly no

hemorrhage was notedit is impossible

however to absolutely rule out mechanical injury
as a factor in causing the appearance of these local
symptoms when an individual is bitten by a helo-
derma the animal has very powerful jaws and
its bite would easily bruise a large area of flesh and
skin when the animal bites it clings tenaciously
and in endeavoring to extricate a wounded part of
the injury might easily be increased

whether potassium permanganate is destruc-
tive to helodcrman venom is not determined
therefore we can not recommend it as of value
in case of a bite by this animal we would only
suggest releasing the bitten part as rapidly and
yet as coolly and carefully as possible and then
seeking a physician perhaps first inducing some
bleeding and then washing the wound with an anti-
septic the venom is not to be regarded as deadly
to man hence there is no need for hysterical fear

  in closing on heloderma we would suggest that
there is no good reason for remorselessly slaying
every gila monster encountered rather should wc
class it with the road runner and the jxxcary as
unique features of our fauna a part of the charac-
teristic landscape of arizona like the giant cactus
among the flora of the state

  also in addition to a detailed statement
of treatment for snake-bite and poisonous
insect bites the bulletin takes up another
subject that has produced much argument

-the hydrophobia skunk its conclu-
sion is that there is no particular species of
skunk which can be designated as the
hydrophobia skunk but that skunks
are rather more likely to bite sleepers than
are coyotes wolves and dogs and that
perhaps a larger proportion of bites from
skunks produce rabies mr vorhies arrives
at one unavoidable conclusion-in case
of skunk-bite take the pasteur treatment

  i noticed in one of your recent numbers a request
for a poem from some party and one of your
other readers had supplied him with it through
your camp-fire pages a number of years ago
i read a poem called the ballad of boastful bill
in a book of cow-country ditties and have never
been able to get a copy of it since all i can
remember of it is as follows

        the ballad of boastful bill

    at a cow camp on the gila

      one sweet morning long ago

    ten of us was throwed right freely
       by a hoss from idaho

    and it looked as though hed go a begging
       for a man to bust his pride

    till a-hitching up one legging

       boastful bill cut loose an cried

       im an ornery proposition for to hurt

          i fulfill my earthly mission with a quirt

          i can ride the highest liver
          twixt the gulf and powder river

          an ill ride this thing as easy as id flirt

  if any of you readers can supply the balance of
this i would feel obliged i will watch your camp-
fire pages for results thanking you for your favor

tn the language of the poet you can
search me remember the strange
manuscript picked up in a bottle on the
nova scotian coast which passed on to
the camp-fire	

camp-fire brought forth a number of
interesting translations yes and remem-
ber that edgar young confessed he and
a friend had thrown it overboard in the
south atlantic as a hoax well that
seems to settle it doesnt it only it
doesnt for the original sender writes
indignantly that youngs message could
not be the one he has because the latter
was found before the date on which the
hoax was pulled off

  heres the letter from our nova scotian
comrade-at least such part of it as it
seems right to make public i pointed out
to the writer that edgar youngs address
appears in every issue of the magazine

- nova scotia

  while not disputing edgar youngs veracity or
intentions i note that he says he did this in 
and  was a miner full grown and earning mens
wages at a coal-face at that time it was in -
 we nova scotia miners had our twenty-two
monthsstrike for u m w recognition

kj ow to the point i can not understand edgar

    young says he wrote a message purporting to
be from hlackbume in  well this old chart
was found when i was a school kid and i left school
when  and am  years old now my uncle
died in  and he and a chum found this old
bottle in  so how does that rhyme with
comrade youngs statement

  its queer that there are two old - about

the jcality of the bay and rivers indicated also
a good clear spring in a line with that tree and
the anchorage also that tree which i have found
and identified-by markings which are similar
to some on the old chart which edgar young no
doubt can describe what i can not understand
is how he wrote it in  and it was found in
 as i have ascertained by going over some files
of old letters

jsjow im not boosting this thing for publicity

     im on the lone trail in this thing and have
reason to believe that there is a rich find for some
one if however edgar young can describe that
old chart and explain how it was written in 
and found in lhe fall of  also how i knew of
it and took it to the high school principal here when
a school kid of  or so and was a man of  when
it was written thats too psychological for me to
comprehend i would like to get hold of that old
account of that pirate hlackbume as i think ive
located lhe old fellows favorite rendezvous

  i wonder if edgar young can tell me where to
get it also id like to correspond with him to see
if he can fully describe the locality drawn on that
chart in my possession if his claim is authentic
and true then the whole thing is a hoax perpe-
trated and invented for the purpose of misleading
and deceiving it certainly accomplished its pur-
pose if so for i know ive spent hours untold in
corresponding about it and had offers to buy it
from folks who could decipher part of it and not
all so they said but were particularly anxious to
see the original

  this has been no joke in our family---

  and here is edgar youngs reply

                                    brooklyn

  the first thing that occurred to me when i read
what that fellow had to say about the capitan
blackbume manuscript was to shut up like a clam
he has his dates wrong and seems set on making
a liar out of me my first decision was to let that
ms remain a mystery and i was advised by a
close friend to say nothing about it even if i had
written it fate seems to be mixed up in this and
i was unable to follow my better judgment and
remain silent

there happens to be living proof to support the
details i gave you in the former letter this
is the man who was with me and helped concoct
the ms right here a funny tiling comes in
this man and  parted in anger in nicaragua in
 and have not spoken or written each other
since the cause of our disagreement was very
slight and i have always kept track of him through 
others for he was a true-blue pal one of the only
two i met up with we made the trip from colon
down the cast coast of south america and back
up the other side working in all the countries en
route he remained to work in ecuador and i
came to panama to work for the panama railroad
until he arrived we both went to nicaragua
where we worked as officials of the national rail-
ways i as auditor and he as general storekeeper
we separated after some seven months

  he blew up first and came to new york and i
blew up later and came to san francisco later
he returned to panama and went into the con-
tracting business and was civil engineer for some
panama government work i understand he is
now employed by the panama railway or was the
last time  asked about him i am pretty sure he
has kept track of me in fact  know he has for
a friend has passed along comments he has made
on stories of mine that appeared in magazines

i possibly owe him an apology for the words

  passed between us in nicaragua for he was

really trying to keep me from making a- fool

out of mvself which i later did but i do not
intend to write him an apology now at the present
time to get him to uphold a statement in regard
to a fool ms we placed in a bottle in  even -
if i did proof obtained in this manner would be
worthless the best tiling i can think of is to run
the explanation i have given in camp-fire and
right with it run the later letter of the man who
has the ms at the present time which makes a
liar out of me i am willing to appear in the

role he has placed me i am pretty sure that-

will come forward with a statement if he happens
to see the letters which he no doubt will see if
he does not i will still be satisfied however i
feel pretty sure he will not let that fellow put the
kobie on me

tn the meantime i have framed the card in a

  little frame i got at the five-and-ten and have
it hanging on lhe wall over my desk i remember
the exact words that passed when lhe ms was
wrillen part was writlen by each of us i

made the arrow pointing down stream-made

the little house in the comer and the anchor i
io

adventure

dont remember whether we showedit to captain
funcke or not if we did he may see the discus-
sion and come forward with further corroboration
he will no doubt remember the two strange pas-
sengers who refused to eat on the latter end of the
voyage and whom he came to visit in the room of
the best hotel in rio after we landed in company
with a ships chandler of the city

  it may be that some of the shipmates of this
mans uncle will write in and stale that the dates
he has are in error for they certainly arc i was
bom in  and i am sure i did not write that
before i was six years old i am saying it was
written with a watermans fountain-pen bought
from the panama railroad newsstand at gatun
of which mrs nolte was in charge on board the
good ship merkador between the th and st of
december  and thrown overboard between
barbados and rio

  these are the facts if proof comes naturally
let it come i have always been something of a
fatalist i dont know what reason fate had for
making me get mixed up in this from present
circumstances it looks as if she wanted to make

a liar out of me it may be that the ms -

and i wrote was intended to bring us together
after we had split up quien sabc and again
quien sabc

jjight here i rest my case if you wish to use
this letter please use blank spaces for the

names of-and- for the love of m iguel

what reason would i have to claim authorship of
a ms the sea has returned dont the editors
return enough of them thats a good one due
to the supply of mss we have on hand from the
mermen and mermaids we herewith return as
unavailable etc

  it has just occurred to me thatlets

find out lets get some dope on the other bottles
that were thrown over at the same time and some
of which i am sure have been found perhaps the
ink paper etc of these other messages contain
proof -i am idling the truth and have nothing to
fear from later developments-edgar young

  so there we are-or arent as i said
in the beginning you can search me two
documents instead of one perhaps a
scheme to arouse interest and capital in a
treasure-hunt doesnt sound so on the
face of it quite a number of possible
solutions offer themselves but no one of
them proves itself

  but im not holding out on you except
of course the mans name and address
which he gave me in confidence i can
add only the fact that i never met him
and know no more about him than you
do and the minor detail that when edgar
young first wrote me that he had set that
bottle adrift i replied asking whether he
were kidding me and was assured that he
was not if the two men have corresponded
since the above letters i have not heard
the results but im writing to both and

asking so maybe therell be more news
later

  at least lets hope that edgar youngs
old pal comes across the kind of man
mr young describes would hardly fail
to toe the scratch in such a case if it comes
to his attention

owing to something i dont remem-
ber but which was quite likely my
own fault henry leverages introduction
to camp-fire doesnt reach us in the same
issue with our first story from him but be
easy on me and meet him now if there are
any of the old karluk men among us they
can write mr leverage in care of this
office

new york

  in introducing myself to the camp-fire im
going to lie down fill up my old cord-wrapped pipe
reach for a brand and between pulls say

  the iron dollar my first story to sell to
adventure is almost fact i can see the picture
now coming home to san francisco a dirty
sawed-off whaler-twenty-four in the focasle-
and only two american-born among them

  we had beans for all three meals over the period
of two months beans-topped with salt-horse
the crew started promising certain things which
were gomg to happen to the skipper they sharp-
ened knives and mentioned the hrst time they got
the old man ashore

we landed and all hands went with the skip-
per into the nearest dive-it was called the
blubber room in those days he bought a
round of steam beers everybody shook hands with
him and he went out-without a knife in his back

  i dug in my dungaree trousers fished forth a
five-dollar gold-piece and offered to buy a square
meal twenty-three whalemen followed me into
the home dairy restaurant they glanced at
the menu card coughed stared at the wall where
signs hung inscribed roast-becf very rare
chicken fricasee liver and bacon

  they passed these up grinned sheepishly and
all ordered baked beans

  the next day i signed off received an iron
dollar for eight months labor and bade good-by
to the sea

  i wonder if any of the camp-fire readers were
aboard the karluk with captain mcgregor during
the season of  i would like to hear from
them-leverage

in some of hugh pendexters earlier
stories in our magazine we met the
oneidas pretty frequently and now here
comes a comrade with their blood in his
veins to talk with us when he wrote
two days before the armistice was signed
he was serving on the u s s roanoke so
you see it has been a long time coming to
the surface in our mail-bag perhaps by
the camp-fire	

this time he is at the headwaters of the
amazon according to his desire but if
walter r johnson remembers him and
will write him care of this office mr ben-
ton will probably get it sooner or later for
he sits in at our camp-fire whenever hes
where he can get to it or i can for-
ward to the name and address of friend
registered for mr bentons identification
card

  i	omit a small bit of his letter merely
because it endorses the idea of a badge for
us to wear and that badge has since then
been adopted and come into use

  mr benton spells it oniedoes not
oneidas and as his spelling is ok in
the remainder of his letter im wondering
whether that is the french form or whether
im all wrong as to oneidas being the
same tribe im no wiseacre on our old
indian tribes despite a strong interest in
them

u s s roanoke

  it has been a good while since i last wrote to
you but i can not give any account of myself at
present for military reasons but being a seaman
for some years gone you may be sure fritz has
received my cajjing-cards since we went into the
war

theres one thing i can mention i believe

    about three months ago i was caught in one
of the most beautiful ninety-mile gales that ever
visited these parts which shook all the tropic fever
i ever contracted out of my bones it turned the
tugs to the beach chased everything in general
to shelter and left me to fight it out with a -footer
my boots slicker and one perfectly good pair of
wool socks were missing when i reached my ren-
dezvous sorry i can not give a better description
of the incident but any shipmate that has had
experience at sea knows how she is whe she
makes you wish you were a longshoreman instead
of a common seafaring man

and i noticed also a letter from mr walter r

   johnson whom i believe i met in quito
ecuador and later in guacayilla quite a few years
ago and if my memory serves me right he offered
me a comrades hand and financial help perhaps
my looks justified his offer for at the time my sole
possession was a dungarie suit and a suit of serge
in the clothing line- but my most carefully
guarded secret was  english pounds at that date
four hours previous to our meeting i was beached
from the english tramp union for getting too
affectionate with a pinch-bar i was just barely
in my teens then and i havent grown but one inch
and gained four or five pounds since so perhaps
mr johnson would still know me if we chanced
to meet again which i hope will be in the near
future

  i may add that i have passed the expert rifle
course since that time and i long for the wars
end i crave a trip far up the headwaters of the

amazon and over the borders of bolivia after-
ward i still expect to return to the states and
become a settled hombre but i would be glad
to hear from mr johnson and would appreciate
meeting him again very much i would also like
to hear from mr young

  so why not give it a trial i have met many in
my years at sea the most famous of the places
i like to go to when i call there is wilcoxs in
colon i still cast a longing eye and heart in the
direction of the san bias country

  and i may say for the interest of all concerned
that i am a halfeast of the famous old tribe of-
the oniedoes as we were called by the french
and now known as part of the praying indians of
the north country and the other half scot-
english you may easily guess where my roving
blood was picked up and why it still bums-
learny j benton

  p s-i would be glad to hear from any member
of camp-fire and will answer any inquiries that
i can within reason-l j b

 i his letter was written november 
-  probably reached me a month
or so later and has somehow got out of
turn-as often happens-in the mass of
gool material waiting to be heard at camp-
fire	sorry for the delay but the

letter ms lct none of its interest ameri-
cans serving with the australians in egypt
and the holy land of course but even
yet were not quite used to the mixing up
the war gave this old world and its peoples

 penmanship what do we care about
his penmanship except to be sorry he
didnt come through the war-furnace un-
singed

port said egypt

  i have never written to you before but would
like to join the camp-fire gatherings

t am serving under the australian flag with the

  australian light horse the cavalry that has
done the great work in gallipoli peninsula egypt
sinai palestine and syria there are many more
yanks serving here in the australian forces besides
me we arc keeping up the name of the dear old
states over here

  i have had some great experiences since i left
home i have traveled about the hawaiian
islands society and cook islands the philippine
celebes borneo islands and knocked about china
japan australia ceylon and india i have seen
gallipoli all of egypt sinai palestine and a good
bit of syria since i have been here i have had
many thrilling adventures in my travels and was
shipwrecked on an uninhabited island in the china
sea for ten days

  now that the war is over i will return to america

  i am a lever of tropical countries and islands
so i intend to do more traveling about looking for
adventure after spending several months with my
old folks at home-trooper c h detert a i f
egypt

  p s-please excuse my penmanship as my
nerves are shattered


adventure

one of you suggested the old indian
sign as a kind of greeting or sign for
members of camp-fire when they meet or
when one of them wants to know whether
some other fellow is a member i sup-
pose there is still need to explain that any
one is a member who wishes to be i
wrote to uncle frank huston to be sure
of just how the sign is made he says

  hand up palm fonvard thumb and fingers
joined youve made the sign often and never
knew what it was of course made casually and
quickly the fingers are not always stuck and glued
together sometimes the hand is not raised above
the shoulder again level with ear again top of
head

  so there is the sign if any of you ever
care to use it if you do youd better
say so so that we can mention it at camp-
fire now and then to be sure that all mem-
bers new and old understand what it
signifies in our case

cactus barrel and giant some more
about it from one of our southwestern
comrades

prescott ariz

  just move along a bit will you and make room
for me to sit next you at the camp-fire circle

tn the camp-fire of your sept rd issue
is a letter which  found interesting and also
somewhat a bit in error the barrel cactus which
is a source of water for the desert wanderer is
quite accurately described by him the thorns are
hooked slightly and are rather more elliptical in
cross section than flat as he describes these

thorns are about  in in length the cactus grows
from  to  ft in height the best way to procure
the water it contains is to cut off the top as one
cuts the top of a soft-boiled egg when set in an
egg-cup dig out a bowl-shaped hollow take a
long-bladed knife or a clean sharp stick and jab
it up and down in the pulp thus freeing the water
which will accumulate in the bowl prepared
quite a quantity of refreshing liquor will thus be
secured and it is a god-send to the man on the
desert whose water supply has been exhausted

  the otlier cactus he refers to is the giant cactus
properly called saguaro pronounced in this part
of the country and in mexico sah-hwar-ro and
generally incorrectly spelled by the story writers
i have seen this cactus attain p height of  to 
ft in many localities of the southwest i am
enclosing a photo of a comparatively small one
beside which i had my driver stand for a com-
parison being a bit nearer the camera than the
cactus he is a little larger in perspective than his
true relative height would be the other small
photo is of a group of young saguaros which was
so unusual an occurrence for the number grouped
that i thought the photo worth taking the large
photo is of a young saguaro and behind it is an
ocotillo pronounced o-ko-teel-yo

vtow a bit of criticism if the comrade whose
letter i read walked from meyer mayer
to phoenix he probably took the black canon road
which passes east of the black canon proper and
between it and the agua fria rlver crossing the
latter at canon where it takes a short turn to the
west just below the mouth of the black canon
before continuing its southerly course i hardly
think he would have walked through the black
canon unless prospecting for mineral and cn
route to phcenix from mayer he does not get any-
where near cave creek which is quite some miles
to the east of the agua fria but he will cross cave
creek wash after he has got down on to the desert
which is a continuation of the salt river valley

looking
ahead
for
democracy

this summer at the national classical confer-
ence at the national education associations
convention in milwaukee the dean of princeton
university voiced the aim of the conference-the

study of the classics must be maintained because
they are vitally important to our own language
and said the dean to insist that there is no edu-
cation worth the name unless it involves training
looking ahead for democracy



the mind not for the sake of money place or
power but in order to develop our boys and girls
to their highest mental and moral excellence to
make them masters in thought and in expression
and thus to send them out equipped for lives of the
highest usefulness

  highest mental and moral excellence token in
its broadest sense and given fullest application is a
sufficiently high and comprehensive aim but
when stated as justification for an organized move-
ment to maintain the study of latin and greek in
our schools and colleges it crumbles into dry scholas-
tic dust proclaiming a vision of mans place and
usefulness in the social order that is academic in
the worst sense of the word narrow hopelessly be-
hind the march of real civilization

i atin and greek i had five years of one and
four of the other and to my own testimony i
i can add that of ninety-odd per cent of all other
classically educated men and women whom i have
questioned that such expenditure of time and train-
ing on these subjects is misguided waste except
for the extremely small proportion of students who
fit themselves for the clergy professorships or cer-
tain scientific lines

  mind training why not get the same kind of
training by learning modern languages that will be
of infinitely more and more practical use these
do not demand the same stiff mental labor wherein
is greek stiffer than real study of academic spanish
and is russian such childs play

  and is it definitely established that the study of
any language os necessary to proper training of the
mind

  the excuse of training is a childish one

  is it then that we should have some knowledge
and understanding of the customs history and
genius of the two peoples who so greatly shaped
civilization that is worth having-unless it
crowds from the boards more vital things but
which gives more of it-time given to conjugations
and struggling translation or a direct intensive
study of the thing itself instead of its medium of
expression

ulture what is culture our own con-
ception of it is as narrow and as selfish as the
huns conception which he calls kidtur he
frankly tramples on therights and welfare of others
ours is more dainty and anemic and merely turns
its back upon these things

  with us culture is a matter of learning not of
wisdom or understanding or even of common sense
to most americans culture connotates litera-
ture painting sculpture music history the niceties
of social attitude and behavior i grew up in that
atmosphere and yet there always arises to me one
smashing question-what right has any one to
culture while a stones throw from him people are
being starved or maimed in body mind or soul who
need not be thus starved and maimed if their

brothers and sisters would think less of this artificial
culture and vastly more of their obligations in mak-
ing human beings happier and more comfortable
how do you answer that question

  some day our whole selfish cold conception of
culture will crumple up and vanish before the de-
mands of the facts of life just as our whole stupid
selfish inherited conception of education has al-
ready begun to crumple under the blows of life
itself

 atin and greek yes they have their values

   but with preventable human misery every-
where staring us in the face with our politics filthy
in corruption our economic fabric black with
selfishness and cruelty and the very pillars of our
whole social structure shaking then the culture and
training from latin and greek become small things
in the scheme of life

  present culture and education have but one excuse
to offer and either too little or too much brains to
offer it the excuse of cain the first murderer-am i
my brothers keeper some day they will realize
that they can have but one sound cxcuse one pos-
sible purpose-making the golden rule more and
more a practical part of real living

  a fantastic dream not if you understand the
golden rule to be not a vague text from a book in
which you may not believe but the one and only
practical work-a-day principle that can bring the
greatest good to the greatest number

t attn and greek what good to teach a boy
latin and greek when you fail to teach him to
be a good citizen is the purpose of public schools
merely to teach each individual how best he can ad-
vance his own selfish interest or is it to teach each
one how each profits from all and all from each and
that the public welfare is not an empty phrase
but a direct and practical obligation lid upon
him

  and until we americans learn that truth and begin
to practise it neither labor nor capital republicans
nor democrats socialism bolshevism nor democ-
racy nor any other class party or theory can get
for us what every one of these claims it will get for
us you can not build a sound house out of rotten
bricks nor a sound government out of bad citizens

  there is no magic remedy there can be no real
democracy except in the minds of the people you
can put it there only by education the only way
to get that education working is by systematic or-
ganized effort

  latin and greek leave them in the schools if
there is room but let them have no place whatever
until youre sure the schools are making it their first
task to make good citizens by direct teaching

  cant be done it can be taught as easily as the
classics economics history and all the rest do
you not teach your own children moral standards
if you can teach your child individual morals can
you not teach him social morals-a s h

winter hunting in alaska

there is game a plenty for the man who
is used to roughing it and game of the
sort one can seldom find in any other part of
north america then there is the joy of
the vast silent places-the inimitable
wilderness

  question-i should like to get some information
regarding the best place in alaska or northwest
canada to spend several months i mean a place
where is plenty of big game and far enough from
civilization that one will not be molested by others
would i have to employ a guide for such a trip

  what is the regulation regarding hunting in
alaska also in regard to  colt revolver and 
automatic winchester rifle do you think that
one could find enough excitement to spend a whole
winter up there if so could two men carry enough
equipment for the winter as we are accustomed
to traveling light we would expect rough conditions
could the trip be made in a canoe

  any information concerning the route place and
equipment clothing rations etc will be thankfully
received

  what would you estimate the cost of the trip for
two fellows-w e wentworth u s army

  answer by mr solomons-you only have to
employ a guide on the kenai peninsula south of the
new railroad that is being built elsewhere a guide
is unnecessary and a nuisance the country is so
big and services of guides so little in demand that
there are no such things that are reliable any
weapons dependable in the states here are usable
and satisfactory in alaska except that for bull
moose and the alaska grizzly-a not very frequently
met animal-you want a pretty fairly heavy bore
gun of high power otherwise as to firearms in
general i advise light ones to meet the difficulty of
getting over the ground which is not inconsiderable
in the north and which calls for as light equipment
as possible

  i couldnt promise you excitement for a winter
in alaska as its a rather quiet country and you do
quite a bit of traveling for what you see and get
but if youre looking for a change and solitude and
wildness and a fair amount of game thats the place

  you could ascend or descend a river to a suitable
place in a canoe taking enough essentials for a
winter in the country but i do not advise this
unless youre bridle-wise to the undertaking it
means living mostly on the country

  youd need little equipment that part would be
all right but the grub end of it might give you
pause

  an alaskan winter is a long time and you eat a
great deal and your canoe to be handily handled
will not land you where you want to be with a great
deal of grub after your other impedimenta is de-
ducted but a steamer will land you anywhere on
either of the several big rivers and with enough grub
to be comfortable a very short distance from some
such point you could probably obtain the surround-
ings and habitat you seek and could get your outfit
there quite easily

  for a summers trip a canoe trip would be very
nice or one with a poling boat and you might run
into some game-some small game of course but

as you do not specify your preferences i could not
advise any definite part of alaska as your objective

  as to the cost of the trip-there is not much to
pay after you leave the last transiortation company
with your outfit the cost of the latter you can
estimate for yourself the cost of getting it into
the country will be about equal to the fare of one
man outfit for two to wherever you go but if
you buy all your heavier stuff in alaska as you
should it will probably come to somewhat less
thais all i can give you without specified inquiries
as to routes place equipment clothing rations

planting the south sea islands

here is some information which mr
mills could not give you while the
war was on do you want a plantation
where the climate is glorious where nearly
every conceivable kind of fruit and grain
can be raised where one can choose tem-
perate semitropical or torrid lands where
the fishing is unsurpassed and the hunting
fine theres plenty of elbow-room still
in the world where one can make more than
a mighty good living

  question-i am greatly interested in the south
sea islands as a money-making proposition i
mean planting and also adventure  am a motor
mechanic by trade nineteen years old my ques-
tions are

  	what is the best and cheapest way to get
there

   	what arc the licst islands to settle in

  	what are the lxst things to plant for quick
results

  	iiow much capital would be required

   	what is the per cent profit one could reason-
ably expect

  	what is the white population of most south
sea islands

   	are motor tractors used at all and how is the
planting done-leonard j richards bendigo
australia

  answer by mr mills-now that the war is
over you can get much information op the islands
that was forbidden during the course of the war
by the way if you will allow me the interpellation
this is a good tip too for the other readers of
adventure who have asked me for details which
were forbidden by the war censor it will interest
all and sundry to learn that when i started answer-
ing questions for ask adventure i recommended
my correspondents to write to the union and other
shipping companies trading in the south seas
asking them to send copies of their very interesting
pamphlets on tours of the islands some of my
replies were opened by the censor and then i
got an intimation from the union s s co that
their pamphlets had been withdrawn from circu-
lation during the war period i think that you
can apply to the melbourne office of the union
steamship company or the office of the bums
philp company sydney or brisbane for a copy
of their pamphlets describing tours of the islands
and on the conditions prevailing there they
i

adventure

are highly infqrmative publications now let me
get at your seven queries seriatim

  	the best and cheapest way to the islands
from bendigo will be either from sydney or bris-
bane according to the group you decide upon
that you should fix upon after perusing the sug-
gested pamphlets fares have altered so much
during the war period that i can not answer as to
cheapness here again the pamphlets will be of
value be sure lo tell the shipping company just
what you want

  	write to the honorable the minister of the
interior melbourne and ask him whether any
special inducements are on offer for settlers in
thenew guinea papua group and other parts
of the south seas that australia now occupies
make sure of the climates picking one that will
suit you

 	depends upon the group you choose you
have a choice between oranges bananas copra
coconuts-and what about cotton

  	have your ocket pretty well lined money
makes money even in lhe islands here again i
must be general not definite the money needed
depends upon the area you desire to take up

  	as in other parts of the world profits arc
according lo persistence

  	not many white folks on any of the groups
off the beaten track the whites are very few
there is quite a settlement of whites on raro-
tonga in the cook group and in samoa

  	the islands have many of the conveniences
of modern liie but i have not heard that they are
up to date with motor tractors the plowing is
done in the good old-fashioned way

prospecting the andes

in that wild little kuown country on
the eastern slope of the andes in ecua-
dor many believe bonanzas are to be found
its a land where only the daring and the
strong can succeed-the kind of the savage
jivaro one man brought out a bag of
gold but was insane other parties have
gone in never to return still fortunes
are being made there

  question- am anxious to obtain some infor-
mation on the advisability ol a trip to the west
coast of south america under the conditions men-
tioned

  there are two of us who will make this trip
our training and experience consists of many years
of roughing it in the yukon territory and alaska
and a university training in geology at one of the
best universities have had a wide practical
knowledge of metal mining including placer and
mining geology

  the primary object of this proposed trip would
be lo prospect for gold and silver and due to a
lack of knowledge of the mineral resources of the
country you might state the most advantageous
section which would be free from malaria and
other diseases and still possess some good possi-
bilities

  what would be the cost of such a trip from san
francisco including fare and equipment please
mention the caliber and make of any firearms we

would need considering the laws of the country
in question with regard to the importing of fire-
arms the size of the game and the chnee o secur-
ing ammunition

  would you advise the purchase of burros upon
our arrival to carry equipment and provisions
what would be their cost would the hostility
of the natives hinder us in any way in the section
you would suggest-victor e ekholm strawn
texas

  answer by mr young-possibly the richest
country in minerals of all south america is the
republic of colombia said to be the richest bound-
ary of land above water in the entire world since
  gold mines have made good and fcr
the past year the average in gold exported has
been over  dollars worth per month the
amount of silver that has been exported staggers
the imagination colombia also furnished the
world with the bulk of its emeralds mainly from
the famous muzo district from which emeralds
have been mined since immemorial times

  the platinum of colombia is much purer than
the russian metal and the supply is increasing
yearly formerly this metal was thrown away
and was a source of much trouble to the miners
to get rid of it from the gold now they are dig-
ging up the streets where it was formerly thrown
and panning the dirt copper tin lead zinc
mercury antimony arsenic sulphur coal asphalt
petroleum iron rubies sapphires garnets ame-
thysts are being extracted and exported

  however for the prospector due to the fact that
colombia has been fairly well prospected over i
would suggest ecuador as a more likely spot to
make a rich strike this is the same kind of
country and the minerals have scarcely been
touched i was talking last week to a man who
made the trip from rio bamba by foot to the
napo and on down to iquitos by boat and he
told me he saw the indians with lots of dust to
trade

  there is a tribe of very hostile indians called
the jiveros or jivaros up above where he struck
the river and it is impossible to get up into their
country due to the fact that they will not allow
a white man nor neighboring indians to enter this
mans name is walter r johnson

  when i was in ecuador a few years ago i met
up with a mr morley at huigra and he also told
me about rich gold country over there there
was a party went in and the lone man who came
out a negro the ninth man of the party who
came out at para brought a huge bag of very
large nuggets out with him he was crazy as a
loon but drew a map after he got back here in
the united states another party came down
with the map this negro had made and after they
went in nothing was ever heard ol them walter
johnson told me they were above the little village
of napo which is jivero and bad country he
says there s no danger below this village but
plenty of it above also he claimed the indians
were verytame after you leave napo going down-
stream the way he put it he said he would
guarantee that a man struck good placer ground
on this river the ecuadorian people are buffa-
loed by those indians over there and there is a
chance that there is a bonanza located there you
can take that with salt if you want to you know
ask adventure

how visionary we old prospectors get to be and
walt is as bad as i am

  that is the country i would pick if i went back
in south america to prospect due to the following
reasons colombia has been pretty well located
up peru was worked out fairly well by the incas
bolivia is solid full of mineral and has many com-
panies looking it over chili is mostly nitrates and
water is scarce

  my next bet would be either venezuela or the
guianas and then northern brazil

  there is a railroad operated by an american
company running up into the interior of ecuador
to quito from duran just across the river from
guayaquil guayaquil is a hell-hole for fever
but after an hours ride you arc above the fever
line and it begins to get cool you can go from
sea level to perpetual snow

  the climate after you get into the high plateau
about  feet high is delightful the good
prospecting country is on the eastern slope of the
country to my notion in the extreme headwaters
of the rivers flowing into the amazon right at
rio bamba you cross a stream that could float a
canoe which flows into the amazon it could
float one but it would be hard work for its just
a few feet across at this point i looked at it with
this view in mind and believe by wading part of
the way until a man reached more water he could
run a canoe right from rio bamba if he took it
easy and did not get smashed up

  there is a road running back into the archidona
district from quito and the trip can be made by
mule to papallacta there is a man in papallacta
who sends mules to quito to bring people out
from there its pack work with indian packers
i think they charge five dollars u s for the
eighteen days pack per indian from papallacta
to napo packing about a hundred pounds these
indian packers are wonders i just came across
a note in quito to bogota by a c veatch
which mentions them sending a message one hun-
dred miles in a day by an indian runner through
rough country there are other records of runs
of  and  miles that are unbelievable by a
white man they have been bred for the purpose
from ancient times they work for little pay and
will stick until the cows come home

  the first class fare from san francisco to guaya-
quil is about  second class is much less
and with a hammock and a few dollars to the
steward is not bad i prefer a freight boat and
if you could make connection with a captain who
would sign you on as super-cargo or purser and
then accept about fifty dollars it is much better
i never saw a captain of a tramp yet who wouldnt
carry a man if approached right

  firearms - rifle or carbine  or colt
standard  single shot or repeating for a able gun

  game puma jaguar bear tapir armad llo
anteater opossum capybara deer red and white
hare rabbit monkey birds of many kinds fish
of many kinds will not bite a hook but are killed
with berries by the indians in the lowlands
on both eastern and western side there are many
reptiles but these disappear in the highlands
in the extreme highlands game is scarce

  pack with indians instead of burros you can
get burros or llamas sulky brutes in the high
country an indian can travel ten times as fast
and is less trouble



  i am giving you a line on a rainbow end that
i would tackle if i had prospecting in my head
just at present

  write pan-american union washington d c
for the booklet ecuador

  there are a number of american outfits working
in colombia up around medellin and all of them
are good for a job if a man blows in its no use
to write them from this end though if you
stopped in colombia and looked these mines over
it might give you an idea of the formations to be
met with in ecuador but its a hard trip to get
back up to them in colombia due to lack of trans-
portation

  you can get all provisions necessary in quito
rio bamba or other cities and towns gold
pans etc should be taken from this end for the
wooden bowls the indians use are unwieldy for a
white man i have used a large frying-pan in
place of a pan

orange growing in california

the great exodus from city to farm
seems to be under way at least our
ask adventure experts are deluged with
letters asking how and where one can et
a living from the soil and make a real houc
if you are one of those who contemplate
such a move dont forget that oranges
yield often  per acre mr harriman
gives some sound advice about raising cit-
rus fruits

  question-in the near future my parents and i
intend moving to southern california therefore
i should like any information you can give regard-
ing this part of your state especially the section
lying near los angeles

  is orange raising profitable what books can
i read on orange culture is orange land expensive

  how large are the ranches usually owned in
southern california

  i understand there are agents who undertake
the sale of ones oranges and who also buy them
on the trees is this true

  we would like to board in los angeles while
looking over the ground can one rent a five-acre
farm with the intention of buying later and how
much clear profit might be expected from a good
crop on such a farm

  what is the fare from this city and how long
would travelling time be-francis j zoeller
brooklyn n y

  answer by mr harriman-yes orange culture
is very profitable to experts i have no lists of
books with me here for i am kx miles from home
yes the land is expensive about all available
land fit for citrus fruit lias been set to trees now

  an orange ranch in full bearing brings from
s to  an acre young trees on new
land with five years still to wait before bearing
bring from  to  an acre land with
one-year-old trees brings from  to  an
acre

  the orange orchards average around  to
 acres each though some are larger even up to
 acres
adventure



  the otange growers have associations that handle
the entire crop in any particular section but the
growers do their own picking mostly

  the best thing you can do about a boarding
place is to go to some hotel like the trenton on
olive street and stop there while you hunt up the
kind of place you like

  no owner of a citrus orchard would consider
renting it to any man who was unused to citrus
culture because an inexperienced man would ruin
it as for the clear profit that depends upon soil
the man in charge the use of fertilizer etc but
growers expect about  to  an acre profit

  see your brooklyn railway agent about fare and
time of travel no use in writing clear across the
continent to learn what is at your own door nor
is there any use in my bothering a local agent to
hunt up information you should get there

  be careful how you trust real estate agents

raising ginseng

many herb experts are now success-
fully raising this valuable plant in
the united states but korea seems to be
the boss land for ginseng as for cultivat-
ing it in the tropics there are many con-
flicting opinions has any of you ever
seen the plant grown in a hot climate

  question-i am desirous of experimenting on
my plantation with ginseng and as i know
nothing whatever about this root i will be very
thankful for any information which you may be
able to send regarding same

  we have good soil and a splendid rainfall and the
temperature varies from  to  degrees the year
round so you see we have no winter or extreme
heat-cnas e hamilton misima island papua
australasia

  answer by mr ritchie-as to trying the experi-
ment of raising ginseng in the papuan group i can
only give you the broadest first-hand information
but i am writing the u s department of agri-
culture at washington d c to ask if they have
any bulletins on ginseng culture if they send me
any material on the subject i shall forward it at
once to you

  as you know doubtless korea leads in the pro-
duction of ginseng though a small amount comes
from manchuria and in some of the southern
states of this country ginseng is raised with more
or less success the climate of korea is temperate
with snows in winter and rarely higher temera-
ture than  degrees in summer the korean
root is collected after the first frost when the sap
of the plant has all gone to the root it is pre-
pared after an elaborate native formula of macera-
tion in rice water and drying in a closed pot over
a slow fire

  offhand i should say that the great difference
in your climate over the korean would prohibit
the success of its growing with you it is dis-
distinctly not a tropical plant whether it can be
grown successfully in a tropical climate i can not
dare say i hope that the agriculture department
may have a bulletin which will give you much more
specific information than i can

ancient ruins of central america

f  hat a highly civilized race the mayas
existed in that region just south of
mexico is a proven fact their cities and
temples are fast being excavated but even
yet many remain undiscovered in the depths
of dark central american jungles by rail-
road or boat one can be carried almost to
the doors of these ancient ruins and the
great mysteries of this early race will no
doubt soon be solved

  question-i have read with much interest your
notes on central america as it is in adventure of
eighteenth april issue but i would like some direct
information on british honduras guatemala etc
in regard to the ruins of the maya period

  what is the best way to reach them and are the
principal ruins far from the beaten path from the
little practical knowledge i have on the subject i
assume the united fruit co steamers are best way
of reaching british honduras and guatemala
but how near one can get to the best known ruins is
what i wish to know and any information you can
give me on this subject will be gratefully received
-wentworth g field

  answer by mr young-quirigua ruins where
extensive excavations have been made is within a
mile of the railroad that crosses guatemala copan
which has been excavated revealing a city of great
magnitude is about sixty miles from the guatemalan
railway which is about as good a way to get there
as any other i think the road leaves from zacapa
for this ioint

  professor marshall h saville department of
anthropology columbia university has taken
several scientific expeditions down to central
america another american who spent the greater
part of several years making excavations in copan is
mr george byron gordon he wrote some articles
for century on this subject which were published
about  or 

  less extensive operations have been carried on in
the ruins of tical quiche tehuacan ciudad an-
tigua sebaco matagalpa boaca viejo san pedro
de lovago leon viejo granadanandaimodiriomo
pearl lagoon omelepe island and other islands of
the gran lago and the chiriqui ruins of panama
and costa rica

  the ruins in nicaragua arc fairly easy of access
but the work done there has been slight the
interior of honduras has only been scratched in this
respect i have not heard of any discoveries being
made in british honduras the principal ones that
have come to my notice being in spanish honduras
however i have no doubt ruins of this kind exist in
british honduras also

  the best way to reach guatemala is via united
fruit boat to puerto barrios and up by rail to the
interior spanish honduras is reached by mule
from the end of a small railroad running inland from
puerto cortez it is about an eight-day trip to the
capital there is an auto bus running up to teguci-
galpa from amapala on the pacific side i believe
better time can be made by crossing guatemala by
rail and then making the trip up from amapala
than by taking the mule trip from the atlantic
side
