new jersey clinic  of patients got
quick relief thousands hail the suc-
cessful results of listerine antiseptic

  if your hair is dull and lifeless   

  if your scalp lacks tone and vigor itches

vigoration those ugly dandruff scales will
begin to disappear as if by magic

treatment just douse listerine on the scalp and
accompany it with vigorous massage by the

fingertips do this once or twice a day and
keep it up systematically remember dan-
druff is a germ infection and requires persis-
tent treatment

  the moment listerine goes on the scalp it
bathes each hair in an antiseptic bath next
it reaches deep down into the hair follicles and
kills pityrosporum ovale the queer bottle-
shaped germ which causes dandruff freed
from this parasite the follicle the hair that
penetrates it and the scalp outside of it return
to normal gaining new vigor and health at

before you invest a single penny in any remedy claiming to re-
lieve dandruff ask yourself has it been subjected to authentic
research by competent authorities arc its claims backed by
ample clinical and laboratory proof so far as we know only
listerine offers such proof on its scientific record alone it
stands forth as the truly effective treatment for dandruff

scorpion on the moon

by m i h rogers

  author of curtains for three etc

chapter i

isle of mystery

ehind barry bartons seem-
ing composure burned a hot
wary excitement he sat
smoking his after-dinner
pipe on the flat end of a bamboo
chaise longue in one of the most
peaceful scenes he had ever known

-silas macgregors moon-flooded
veranda-but silas macgregor was
the man barton had come to hawaii
to investigate perhaps send to
prison

  in front of him marching back
and forth across the grass mats was
lehua macgregor in white organdy
dinner gown a lovely restless ghost


the kona wins

in tapping silver heels the breeze
lifted her black hair as she turned
and a great square emerald sparkled
from her breast her dark eyes were
stormy and her full red lips set in
a rebellious curve

  barton waited for her to speak
no stranger could ever have invaded
this tight little island kingdom
without an entree and barton had
cultivated lehua during the steamer
trip from the mainland with the
purpose of being invited his only
excuse had been that he had a job
to do but now he had a feeling that
lehua might need his help before

that job was completed

  bartons instructions from his cli-
ent were vague check up on silas
macgregor his fire losses have
run into six figures-too much to
be accidental look up jonah pelio
hes the one who tipped us off
and hes secretary to our agent
michael normand be cagy with
him pelio hints that hes in this
too

  when the steamer docked barton
had found jonah pelio among those
meeting lehua but there had been
no chance to see him alone waiting
now on the veranda lanai they called


street  smiths detective story magazine

it here for pelio to contact him
he could not guess that this was
to be his strangest case one which
he would win only by letting him-
self appear defeated down to that
last grim finale on the beach of
kalani

  in the far shadows lehua whirled
and came back into the moonlight
she stopped before barton and
started to speak

  youll have to help me i wont
be-

  the screen door into the house
opened and silas macgregor came
out a thin white-haired man with
deeply lined stern face and tight
down-drooping mouth he stood
squarely on his feet and puffed his
pipe into life watching lehua over
the match flame

 behind him was michael nor-
mand macgregors choice for a son-
in-law normand was a striking
figure bold featured with a white
smile flashing across his tanned face
a big britisher with blond sun-
burned hair and the wide shoulders
and slender hard hips of a man much
in the saddle polo barton thought
tough as barbed wire no man to
trifle with

  michael normand spoke i have
some papers to work on lehua
want me to stick around or am i
excused his clipped english
speech was not unpleasant

  youre excused lehua said
coldly were having singers
later

  oh are you his voice was
eager ill be down when i hear
them he turned to barton i
never get enough of the island sing-
ing it gets under your skin like
no other music on earth

  when he had gone lehua said
there are times when i almost like
michael he loves the islands nearly
as much as i do

 but ye would marry a main-
lander her fathers words struck
harshly on the soft air

  ill teach wes to love kalani
lehuas voice lacked conviction and
she added almost fiercely he has
to

 humph macgregor growled
ill be going up good night to
ye mr barton he stumped in-
side and up the stairs

  lehua took another swift passion-
ate turn across the lanai and back
again her tenseness seemed to
crackle like an electric spark to
break the strain barton spoke casu-
ally of the island home of the mac-
gregors

  kalani lives up to its name of
heaven a very small heaven from
the way you bragged i thought it
as big as oahu and here its only a
tiny islet

  the girl cried angrily my island
is not tiny how could it be and
have a mountain and an extinct vol-
cano

  barton chuckled and she stopped
still a moment laughed more easily
and said

  im sorry i didnt mean to yell
at you

  o k but kalani is small say
what is that gorgeous perfume
ginger blossoms the singers
are here

 there was a rustling from the
hibiscus hedge which grew in front
of the encircling ironwood trees
and three figures emerged into the
moonlight the lilting notes of uku-
leles drifting ahead lehua went
to meet them and barton heard her
exclaim in pleasure as she threw
her arms about a small feminine
figure in a moment she called
come here barry i want you
to meet moana shes jonah pelios
sister and the prettiest hula dancer
in all hawaii
scorpion on the moon



  barry went down the steps this
lovely child pelios sister she
couldnt be over fifteen moana
wore a skirt of split green ti leaves
a crimson silk sleeveless blouse and
her dark hair was wreathed with gin-
ger flowers a lei of the same waxy
blossoms encircled her neck like
small white orchids

  moana why are you on kalani
lehua asked

  there was a perceptible pause be-
fore the girl answered visiting
grandfather hes a very old man
and lonely

  im so glad that barry will see
you dance ready to start

  lehua led barry back to the lanai
watch her hands and arms she
advised him softly the hands tell
the story the hulas are the sagas
of hawaii and this one is about two
lovers who went to the mountain and
took along some okolehao-thats
native hooch they drank too
much

  the men were singing gayly as
if the words amused them and the
tiny swaying body was a miniature
poem in motion when a shadow fell
across the lanai floor there was a
firm step behind barton and a
quickly stifled curse

  michael normand stepped into the
moonlight and for a moment his
handsome features were sharp with
anger as he stared at the little
dancer gone was the genial skip-
per who had piloted them from
honolulu in the big red cruiser that
afternoon here was a man whose
capacities for ruthlessness could
only be guessed

  michael lehua said dreamily

its moana isnt she adora-

  so i see michael clipped out
the words and sat down on the step

  the peaceful languor of the night
was shattered for the second time
and barton felt a chill threat of

unspoken purposes creep and crawl
about them it was borne in on him
that these forces were stronger than
he was that this time he must wait
instead of act must follow and try
to figure out the strange ways of
these people who lived as their emo-
tions dictated he could wait but
he didnt relish it

  now moana was dancing only for
normand her big dark eyes never
left his face her haunting smile
was for him alone

  lehua vhispered that she was a
little fraud moana always thinks
shes in love with some one but
shes fickle as the rain

  the scene delighted and amused
lehua but barton could find noth-
ing amusing in the black rage of
the englishman he knew that nor-
mand was concealing his anger only
by an effort what lay between
moana and normand a sub rosa
affair but lehua had said that
moana and pelio were of good fam-
ily whatever the answer barton
felt that moana was in for a bad
time there was something too still
too controlled about normands tem-
per

  so engrossed was barton in this
new element that he was startled
when the screen door scraped again
he turned to see jonah pelio stand-
ing there his handsome face a frozen
mask of anger his eyes moved
darkly from moana to normand
just for an instant he stood starkly
exposed then moved back into the
shadows against the wall

  unaware of her brothers pres-
ence moana took a ukulele from
one of the musicians and dropped to
the grass she struck a lingering
chord raised her face until the moon
drenched it with silver and began
to sing

  barton felt that he was looking
into the very heart of hawaii and


street  smiths detective story magazine

for the moment forgot the two men
and the ugly passions which tore
them whispering lehua inter-
preted the song it was of love pos-
session desertion and death all in-
terwoven with moonlight and the
leaping white fire of the sea and it
fitted his obsession that in this place
strong natural forces would take
precedence over ordinary methods of
detection

  the song came to an end while
the four people on the lanai re-
mained motionless under the spell
of the moment moana slipped si-
lently into the shadow of the trees
the musicians followed

  lehua whispered her voice vibrant
with feeling i could never give
this up id rather die

  michael normand rose abruptly
made some half audible comment
and moved across the lawn toward
the foot of the garden pelio went
back into the house without speak-
ing

  barton asked why is pelio
angry with his sister

  is he i hadnt noticed proba-
bly shes in love again he wants
her to marry a haole

  and what is a haole

  any white person

perhaps barry said soberly
but its something pretty serious-
with pelio i mean hes furious
he takes life too seriously
lehua said absently

chapter ii

a scorpion in heaven

he moonlight broadened its
path across the lanai lehua
stirred uneasily turned to
face barton

  will you let me talk to you she
asked in a troubled voice confi-
dentially

  if youre sure you want to
thanks perhaps just talking
things over will help me straighten
them out in my mind you think
i should be happy here dont you
she waved one hand at the peaceful
beauty i could be if theyd let
me leaning toward barton she de-
manded could you give up this
island if you had been born here
grew up here

  ive been told you are your fa-
thers only heir

  i am she rose and began again
her restless pacing but he threat-
ens to sell kalani and buy liihau a
larger and more profitable island
unless i marry michael father
claims its because he is old and ill
and afraid to leave the properties to
my handling that isnt true he
has always planned to let the fisher
trust co handle the estate there
is something deeper behind this it
frightens me

  lehua turned her eyes flashing
he has never shown me one scrap
of fatherly affection hes selfish
and grasping and indifferent i
wrote him that i was in love with
wes what did he do he an-
nounced my engagement to michael
thats what he did and ordered me
home

  if this wes loves you hell wait
until you can get your fathers con-
sent or are of age barry said
calmly

  the next instant lehua had flung
herself down on the chaise longue
beside him thats just it her
voice quivered pathetically you
have to understand about wes hes
beautiful and strong and lots of fun
his hair is as yellow as the sun and

hes big and-

  wait up barton interrupted
i cant take it why wouldnt this
modern god wait for you

  lehua looked at her slipper toe
scorpion on the moon



and said unhappily hes poor and
there are lots of rich girls who run
after him

  oh barton was brutal hes
for sale and youre afraid to trust
him away from you

  this time lehua did not flare up
she sounded beaten i didnt ex-
pect you to understand men marry
girls because they can buy them
you understand that father
wouldnt object if i were his son
and chose a poor girl well thats
how i feel and ive grown to hate
him i cant give up kalani and
i wont marry michael

  barton said slowly if you un-
derstood your father youd see that
he must acquire and cling to what
he acquires its his nature

 and any one who gets in his
way is smashed after a moment
lehua said miserably i do know
that and it isnt true that i hate him
but he has never let me love him i
wanted to i might even have mar-
ried michael to please him if i hadnt
met wes i used to like michael
and you dont like him now

  i blame him for the way father is
acting michael is behind this even
if i cant figure out how perhaps
he wants to marry the macgregor
properties

  its quite possible that hes in love
with you

 then hed help me you heard
him mention papers a while ago
hes a lawyer and hes drawing up
a deed to kalani if i sign a mar-
riage agreement with michael father
will sign the deed giving me kalani
ive refused but he showed me an
option to buy liihau and i know
hell sell my island if i hold out
against him

  what are you going to do
lehua lowered her voice to a whis-
per ill sign the agreement get
the deed and go back to the main-

land until im of age and can marry
wes

  how old are you lehua
  almost eighteen

  it wont wash they could brinw
you back	

  her lovely face was suddenly dis-
torted by a primitive rage ill kill
them if they drive me too far i
will not marry michael i wont
during that five days on shipboard
lehua had told him of her hawaiian
blood dating back to when the first
silas macgregor married the dark-
eyed daughter of a king and founded
his island dynasty she was impul-
sive willful generous and lovable
but he had never before seen her
angry it accentuated this mixture
of scotch and hawaiian and it made
barton anxious for her happiness

  there may be another way he
suggested your signature as a
minor is valueless why dont you
stipulate that michael normand is
to change his name to macgregor
when you marry your father
would like that and your prideful
britisher would refuse that would
start an argument and give you time
to fight them

 thats an idea lehua ex-
claimed michael is very proud of
his name hed never consent

 for a moment then they sat in
silence each busy with new
thoughts a thin gray cloud drifted
across the moon took the form of
a sea horse with arched neck and
curving tail the wind caught at
it distorted it into a loathsome
shape lehua stirred and shivered

  a scorpion crawls on the moon
she whispered lets go in
mind if i dont barry asked
ill never get enough of these
nights a whole lifetime would be
too short

  after lehua left him he watched


street  smiths detective story magazine

the shadows as the moon lazed to-
ward the west in a night dreamy
with sweet trade winds he was al-
most sorry when a tall figure crossed
the lawn and jonah pelio sat down
beside him

  barton said she is very lovely
your little sister

 and very lolo-crazy pelio
squeezed his hands together tightly
between his knees his face was
darkly sad michael nor-
mand has been amusing
himself with my sister he
has broken his promises

he wants to be rid of her

to him she is only a hapa-
haole - half-white to-
night he followed her to
their meeting place and
cursed her for coming
here

 pelio unclasped his
hands and struck the step
with doubled fist if i had
only been there i went
to the house of our grand-
father and she came in
weeping his voice deep-
ened and bitter words
poured from his heart
to-morrow when he and
i are swimming in the
lagoon i shall challenge
him to fight one of us
will be shark meat

  for a brief moment bar-
tons blood raced hotly

what a fight that would
be two powerful men as
at home in the water as on
land battling to the death
stripped of all but the sim-
ple purpose to kill and to
keep from being killed

he said

  you cant do it give
me a chance to work this
out pelio theres a way

ill find it

  pelios head drooped i should
never have sent for you i should
have killed him now to punish
normand i must disgrace mac-
gregor and break the heart of lehua
to-morrow i will do what must be
done

  barry tightened his grip on pelios
arm such a move could only result
in defeat for all of them give me
three days he urged just these
scorpion on the moon



three days to clear everything

  for a long time pelio sat silent
then he said i will wait three
days

  barry leaned back relieved pro-
foundly now tell me whats back
of this arson talk

  barton stared frankly at his com-
panion jonah pelio was the same
golden color as his sister tall virile
with bulging shoulders candid dark
eyes and proud handsome features

  lets take the facts first barry
continued the sulsun insurance
co has in the past two years paid
claims totaling half a million dollars
to silas macgregor you believe
these fires were incendiary

  ive studied them carefully and
they are alike in these three things
pelio said soberly first mac-
gregor was never present at the time
of the fire second each fire oc-
curred during a kona wind and
third macgregor had visited the
property shortly before the fire
within a week

  barton mulled over that for a mo-
ment first what is a kona wind
it is a hot wind blown by the
devil from the south-kona way
we call it the sick wind it makes
every one ugly and mean and if it
lasts long enough it makes people
sick-and murderous

  then the fires always happened
during a south wind lets get this
straight whom are you accusing
macgregor or michael normand
both i figure that the old man
caused the fires and normand helped
him cover up and collect as nor-
mands secretary i knew that his in-
vestigations were toy casual

  silas macgregor has always been
a heavy insurer barry said we
must go slowly he waited but
pelio did not comment why
should normand help macgregor
break the law

  because he wants to marry lehua
and inherit the macgregor fortune
pelio answered bitterly for an in-
stant his eyes glowed with passion-
ate feeling

  you suggest that normand is
blackmailing macgregor it will be
tough to prove first well have to
convict macgregor of arson not
easy with one of the wealthiest men
in the islands i could have nor-
mand removed as agent

  thats no punishment pelio pro-
tested even now he is plan-

  planning what

  that is something i may tell you
later again pelio leaned toward
his companion and spoke earnestly
dont be fooled by michael nor-
mand hes as deadly as a tidal
wave hes clever and wicked and
selfish there was deep sincerity
in his voice the money does not
matter but i will not let him marry
lehua

  so that was it why dont you
come clean with me barry de-
manded why these reservations
it isnt smart to keep me in the
dark

  later there is time

  barton shrugged then let me
tell you that its dangerous to make
threats suppose normand should
die in some violent manner

  the hawaiian smiled to you
only do i say these things

  when pelio rose to enter the
house barton did not try to detain
him

  the night grew still again save for
the whispering of the ironwood trees
and the surf on the reef clouds
separated and drifted but always the
cool moon dreamed her heavy-lidded
way to her couch in the western sea
despite thoughts of intrigue and pas-
sion barry was grinning at a cloud
rooster sailing backward when a
throaty whisper from around the


street  smiths detective story magazine

corner of the house broke into his
reverie

  moana why you here so late
it was the voice of a man in the
shadows out of bartons sight plead-
ing poignantly

  so you followed me moanas
voice disdainful and impatient
let go my arm

  not until you tell if you come to
meet that haole

  where i go and whom i meet is
not your affair

  moana and a native lover barton
reached for a cigarette-his light
would warn them they were not
alone

  the man went on desperately
but moana you let me love you

i-

  let go my arm

  they had not heard the match
another actor now entered the
scene a deep resonant voice speak-
ing the girls name

  grandfather moana wailed
why are you here

  to take you home then the
old man spoke to the boy in their
native tongue harshly angrily and
in a moment moana and her grand-
father moved across the lawn with
their going a sighing sob came from
the shadows

  barton had just crushed out his
cigarette when he heard steps shift-
ing his glance he saw the tall white-
clad michael normand turn in from
the road he passed along the side
of the house and when he reached
that hidden corner barry heard his
startled curse

  damn it why are you skulking
here

i wait you it is of moana you
let her alone she not for haole
you confounded pup what do
you mean by such talk keep away
from here and keep moana away

too she followed me here now
get out

  this time barton rose and went
inside up the broad stairway to his
room there was no peace in kalani
where there are no poisonous snakes
but a scorpion crawls across the
moon

chapter iii

sting of the scorpion

a door slammed somewhere
barton opened his eyes to
sunlight some one ran
through the wide upper hall
and another followed as if in pur-
suit high-pitched voices orders
and a babel and confusion going on
below suddenly he knew that this
was not the usual process of bring-
ing the big house to life wide
awake he bathed and dressed hur-
riedly in the hall he saw lehua
hurrying toward her room with a
paper in her hand she stopped

  something terrible had happened
barry my father woke up blinded
this morning ive sent jonah to
honolulu for a specialist he went
in michaels cruiser

  while barton expressed shocked
sympathy his thoughts circled this
curious happening did people go
blind overnight without warning

  ill leave with the boat which
takes the specialist back he said

you wont want to be bothered-

  no dont go i want you to
stay she put a hand on his arm
i have a strange notion that im
going to need you here even if
michael invites you to go back with
him please stay tell him that i in-
sisted she laughed shakily
heaven knows when youll get
breakfast the kitchen wahines are
excited this morning be patient
with them i promise better service
for dinner she turned toward her
room stopped and came back
scorpion on the moon

is

  barry she said in a low trou-
bled voice before jonah left he
passed me the deed to kalani which
michael had prepared im going
to ask father to sign it she saw
the look in his eyes and hurried on
you think ive no feeling dont
you to ask him now but i tell you i
feel as if something dreadful were
going to happen-that i must hurry
i cant explain it you go down to
breakfast ill talk to you later
lehua went to her room opened
the deed and read it carefully brows
knitted a fever of impatience to
get it signed burned in her per-
haps her father would soften now
that his eyes had failed he had
never needed her before now he
might be more kind more under-
standing she folded the paper into
the pocket of her white dress and
went to his room

  michael rose from beside the bed
when she came he shook his head
sadly as she took his place

  are you still in pain father she
asked as michael went out

  its there silas macgregor said
shortly

  the doctor should be here soon
im terribly unhappy over this quar-
rel why cant we be friends i
cant bear to be with you all the
time and have you angry at me

  i have no wish to quarrel but ye
must obey

  father i have the deed to kalani
which michael made out wont you
sign it for me-without any strings
attached ive never asked you for
much and ill try to do what you
want-later she caught her breath
sharply just give me time

  an odd twisted smile showed on
the thin lips beneath the bandages
lehua waited breathless until he
spoke

  very well ill sign for ye

  she put the pen into his hand and

guided it to the signature line her
heart melted with tenderness and
pity and gratitude perhaps they
could have been friends long ago if
she had only tried harder

  you dont think this is greedy do
you she asked you know how
much i love kalani

 ye are a true macgregor he
said

 the words chilled her you
mean that i just love to own things
like you do youre wrong my
love for kalani is all tied up with
my childhood and mother

  at that the strange smile broad-
ened on his lips she stopped trying
to explain and haltingly thanked him
for the deed

  after a lonely breakfast barton
decided to explore the grounds
they had arrived the previous eve-
ning and this was his first daylight
look despite the new turn of
events he must go on with his in-
vestigation

  he crossed the lanai to the lawn
and then down to the coral sea wall
where he sat in the sun facing the
handsome old-fashioned house at
the south corner he noticed a wire
which carried from beneath the eaves
to a tall ironwood tree some forty
feet distant an aerial wonder-
ing idly he saw the radio aerial on
the east side of the house and re-
membered that the radio stood at
that side of the great room his
interest quickened barton was
first of all an insurance investiga-
tor the more he looked at that
wire the more it intrigued him
guest or no he had to see where it
led and why

  he went back into the house and
up the stairs to the second floor
michael normand was typing behind
a door in that slow uncertain way
of an amateur and barry went


street  smiths detective story magazine

quickly past until he came to a
boxed stairway leading to the attic
the door at the top was locked but
the outdated fastening yielded easily
to his manipulations

  many dormer windows admitted
plenty of light but it was infernally
hot and stuffy in the attic he took
off his shoes and went noiselessly to
the south corner sure enough there
was the wire drawn through a short
conduit in the wall just inside it
was twisted into a loop and a string
tied through it the string led to
a wooden box on the floor

  barton squatted to inspect the
box it had eyelets screwed into two
opposite sides and the string was
attached to one of these a rubber
band had been looped through the
other eyelet the box was loosely
filled with shavings and closely
heaped about with rolls of wallpaper
old magazines hat boxes et cetera
all inflammable

  grimly barton reached down and
pushed aside the shavings his lips
tightened the bottom of the box
was lined with coarse sandpaper
his trained mind supplied the miss-
ing ingredient lacking only was a
fat bundle of matches tied head
down between the taut string on one
side of the box and the rubber band
on the other

  imagination finished the picture
a strong south wind the tall tree
swaying that wire pulling the line
dragging the matches across the
sandpaper and the rubber band pull-
ing them back again friction a
flash of fire the shavings igniting
from the matches and flames raging
through the dusty attic

  and then the string would burn
away the wire would snap back to
the tree and hang there unnoticed
until it could be removed another
of silas macgregors properties
gone up in smoke another claim

for sulsun insurance to pay fiend-
ishly clever but this would not be
the same as those other fires this
was the home of lehua-the one for
which she was fighting

  barton stood up dusted his hands
and reflected on macgregors
viciousness he didnt doubt then
that the old man was the maker of
this contrivance the house was
safe for a while-a blind man would
hardly burn the roof over his own
head-and the matches were still to
be installed safe unless some one
else knew of the box

  he shoved at the box with his foot
it was nailed to the floor by the
time he had tied his shoes again and
fastened the attic door he was soak-
ing with perspiration as he went
to his room eager for a shower nor-
mand was still typing

  it was almost noon when michael
normand pulled the sheet of legal
paper from the typewriter with a
sigh of relief he had once been a
fair typist but the task he had set
for himself had brought perspiration
flowing carefully he went over the
document it purported to be the
last will and testament of one silas
macgregor and its terms made one
michael normand the legal guardian
of lehua and executor ofher estate

  it left all property to lehua and
stipulated that she was to marry
michael normand if she refused
she would receive only a stated in-
come until her fortieth birthday and
was to have no word as to the man-
agement of her properties until that
time

  it was a brazenly impudent docu-
ment and would have called for legal
dispute had there been other heirs or
had it been written in any other spot
than the baronial island where mac-
gregor ruled unchallenged michael
normand did not expect to record
scorpion on the moon



it the will was a private weapon
which he intended to use as a per-
suader

 he looked from his window and
noted that the red cruiser ulua had
not yet returned with the eye spe-
cialist stowing the will in his
pocket he went briskly down the
hall to tap on macgregors door
lehua was there and he asked her
to leave them alone for a moment
when she had gone he went in to
find macgregor sitting up more
dour than usual beneath white band-
ages

  ive brought the marriage con-
tract normad lied if youll sign
it ill see about getting lehuas sig-
nature

  silas macgregor chuckled rasp-
ingly put the pen on the line
lehua was in here with the deed
a while ago i signed it for her but
she doesnt know that it will not
make her owner of kalani-yet
he wrote his name in shaky letters
where normand placed the pen

  the tall blond man said nothing
for a moment he regarded mac-
gregor with cynical dislike unveiled
in his eyes and something of con-
tempt while he wondered how
lehua had secured that deed had
she rummaged through his room or
had pelio given it to her normand
decided that his clerk might need
more careful watching as to the
deed-hed take care of that when
the time came

chapter iv

the pencil tree

i he eye specialist arrived and
was taken to silas mac-
gregors room by lehua and
nomand pelio looking
fresh in spite of the long trip sug-
gested a swim and barry donned
trunks and joined him the water

 ds-

was warm and they soon tired of it
to stretch out on the narrow strip
of coarse sand under the hau trees

  before you leave kalani pelio
said in his deep grave voice i must
take you to the wet caves they
are exciting if you care to explore
long ago a native army in flight re-
treated to these caves hoping to hide
there from the enemy it is said that
there were two hundred men

 once inside they had to pass
through narrow trails in single file
and finally crawl one at a time
through a long tunnel the pursu-
ing warriors glimpsed the last man
to go through knew they could
never attack them in there and
rolled a rock against the entrance
they all died of starvation many
bones are still there

 id like to see them barry
agreed

  i acted as guide one summer for
a young geological student from
new mexico pelio continued he
shuddered as if a chill wind had
blown over him and then said
quickly there are many strange
places on kalani

  and strange things too barry
said frankly im puzzled and
skeptical about macgregors blind-
ness his eyes were o k last
night

  you think hes pretending to be
blind

  i dont know what to think the
specialist will settle that point its
queer-unnatural

  for a moment pelio was silent
he rolled on his side and regarded
barry from beneath long black
lashes then he began to talk in his
slow rich voice

 perhaps you should know that
we have a tree here whose leaves
look like green pencils its sap


street  smiths detective story magazine

causes blindness and is a deadly
poison if taken through the mouth

  listening to the incredible impli-
cations behind those quiet words
barry held his gaze on the clouds
you are suggesting that macgregor
could have been blinded acciden-
tally

  it is always possible-but i dont
think so

 barton sat up and went to the
point are you hinting that nor-
mand did this why he wants
to marry lehua the two men are
partners in many enterprises
frankly i dont get the point has
he been stealing from the old man

  he couldnt do that macgregor
is too cautious

 for a long moment barton sat
there silent then he lay back and
stared at the irregular line of the
hau tree against the sky if he
began it were macgregor trying to
injure normand id get it after
all normand knows that the old
man committed arson and its only
natural macgregor would like to
put him out of the way no i tell
you theres something wrong with
the picture

  there is another thing pelio
said michael normand is broke
also he is in love with an ugly long-
legged woman from australia a
breeder of horses he means soon
to join her down under that much
i know and this i guess-he intends
to take the macgregor money with
him

  he plans grandly barton said
and was intensely dissatisfied what
of silas macgregor still several
years from the grave and what of
lehua so young what of her
an icy premonition stabbed through
him only one thing would pry the
bony fingers of macgregor from his
moneybags and lehua had said she

would prefer death to losing kalani
if normand actually contemplated
two murders why should he first
blind one victim

  barry got to his feet if mac-
gregor could so easily be blinded
why not lehua too that sinister
box under the eaves two sightless
people groping helplessly through a
blazing house it was unthinkable
no man could deliberately plan such
fiendishness but barton knew that
he must warn lehua even at the risk
of revealing his profession to the
impulsive girl and perhaps through
her to others

  he hurried to the house to dress
haunted by the cloud scorpion which
had writhed across the moon sternly
reminding himself that hawaiian
scorpions are not poisonous that he
was getting the jitters instinct
suggested that the many-legged
creeper which had scuttled into
lehuas heaven might be from
colder more cruel lands

  pelio did not appear for dinner
and normand had gone to return the
doctor to honolulu so only lehua
and barton sat down at the big table
the servants were edgy and forget-
ful and neither diner had an appe-
tite

  lehua exotically lovely in a soft
sheer white gown a red flower in
her hair and little bare feet tricked
out in high-heeled red sandals apolo-
gized for the service she looked
tired and disheartened

  what was the verdict barton
asked

  permanent loss of vision some
unidentified infection poor old
man

 infection lehua have you
thought that he might have been in-
fected intentionally

  she put down her cup and stared
at him with fear behind her big dark
scorpion on the moon



eyes are you serious

  im afraid i am

  go on

  but thats all dont laugh i

have a feeling that- lehua be

careful of your eyes will you dont
let anything come in contact with
them-not even your fingers

  the girl stared her face whiten-
ing poignant unhappiness in her
eyes thats queer talk she said

  then lets stop it-but dont for-
get to be careful he looked at her
his keen eyes softened into gentle-
ness what else is troubling you
tell

  for a long moment she looked into
his eyes white and miserable then
she reached into the front of her
dress and handed him a scrap torn
from one of the papers brought that
day from honolulu

  there were the pictures of two
young people-a plain long-faced
girl and a handsome youth with reck-
less mouth and narrowed long-lashed
eyes barton read the caption the
girls parents were announcing her
engagement to wesley beesmaier

 shes an automobile heiress
theyll live in new york lehua
said

  barton looked up to see her eyes
bright with tears but her head was
held high

  thats that she said

  he wondered if she meant it

 will you tell me about those
treasures of old hawaii in the hall
he asked gently

 why not theyre all museum
pieces thats where they should
be only the macgregors hold tightly
to their own

  her voice was light and bitter it
stirred him to restless anger at the
old man upstairs and the young one
in the united states who couldnt
risk waiting for her

chapter v

the lunar rainbow ghost

arton retired that night
increasingly troubled and
thoughtful it seemed to
him that he was in some
strange ungoverned land far from
american soil where men silently
meted out their own justice and be-
hind smooth faces plotted dark cru-
elties he felt that he struggled
through a night tangled in a web
whose invisible meshes held him like
a fly is held

 moonlight poured into his room
bringing a restlessness which kept
him twisting and turning was
pelios information accurate con-
cerning normands finances and the
lady in australia what was nor-
mand up to did he have guilty
knowledge of that box in the attic

  batron realized that while he now
had evidence of premeditated arson
he could not prove in court that the
old man had actually placed the box
there and he had absolutely nothing
tangible against normand for
sleepless hours he brooded over the
case

 a sudden drumming of rain dis-
tracted him and he sat up in bed
the moon was shining brightly and
he remembered the lunar rainbows
of which he had heard hoping to
see one he went to the window and
was rewarded there it was lovely
beyond words like cellophane rib-
bons of pearly iridescence there
was a noise downstairs as if some
one had stumbled over furniture a
door slammed and he leaned out to
look down all was quiet he
waited shrill voices came from the
rear of the house

 suddenly a shadow moved close
to the house a tall dark-skinned
man wearing only a pir of white
shorts left the protection of the


street  smiths detective story magazine

house and ran across the lawn a
lunar rainbow floated about his body
waist-high a huge fairy belt of
color moving with him

  pelted by the downpour he ran
toward the trees and barrys first
thought was that it was pelio just
before the man reached the shadows
barton saw a curious thing and
stared wondering if the light from
the rainbow had touched the fellows
back no it was not the rainbow
he caught his breath sharply and
lingered there perplexed long after
the man had disappeared from sight

  the women servants were wailing
downstairs he slipped into his robe
and opened the door the hall
illumined by night lights was
empty he went quietly along it
until he came to lehuas door and
tapped softly hearing sleepy stir-
rings inside he rapped again after
a moment lehua struggling into a
white robe opened her door dark
hair disheveled eyes big and star-
tled

  what is it she asked is fa-
ther worse why are the wahines
making so much noise

  sorry to waken you barry told
her i only wanted to make sure
you were all right some one a
man just ran from the house it
was strange i was worried about
you foolishly i see

  he told her of what he had seen
and she turned troubled eyes on him

  you say he looked like jonah
but he is my friend my guest he
need not run from this house the
clamor below floated up in rising
crescendo what is the matter
with them she repeated theyll
waken father she came out into
the hallway and moved past barton
toward her fathers door

  something sent barton running
past her to reach the door first

  wait he said please dont

go in let me

 but-

  i dont know let me see

  he turned the knob the door
was not locked-any one could have
entered just as he was doing the
room was in darkness closing the
door he snapped the old-fashioned
lock lever and touched the electric
switch

  for an instant he stood paralyzed
by the horrible sight the killer
who had cut silas macgregors
throat had almost severed his head
from his shoulders blood still
ebbed from the red gash death
must have come in his sleep-there
was no sign of a struggle

  barton drew the sheets over the
sickening object and stood for a mo-
ment piecing together the threads
which had twined about him since he
came to kalani lehua tapped
lightly on the door calling in soft
urgent tones thankful for the in-
spiration which had caused him to
lock her out he put out the light
and went into the hall taking the
key with him she stared as he
turned it in the lock

  as gently as he could he told her
that her father was dead and when
she insisted upon going to him he
told her that macgregor had been
murdered

  her eyes widened and her lips
parted trembled as she tried to
speak you-you think the man

you saw-jonah- she wavered

and groped toward the wall for sup-
port

  barton put his arm about her
shoulders and steadied her he
couldnt express his suspicions just
yet or his fear that her life too
might be taken in some such awful
way he could only vow to guard
her until there was no longer any
need he could feel her stiffening
gathering herself together
scorpion on the moon



  i wont believe this of jonah
she whispered hes my friend

  she pushed barton away and ran
down the hall to pelios door
knocked demandingly there was
no answer and she went in looked
into the great closet and shower
room he was not there

  she turned stricken eyes to bar-
ton who had followed ill go down
and quiet the wahines she said
then well find jonah ill never
believe this is true unless he admits
it to me get dressed

  barton watched her as she ran
down the stairway before returning
to his room the wailing of the
servant women died away and he
heard lehua come up quietly he
did not have long to wait she
tapped on his door and he joined
her she wore a straight white linen
dress with low-heeled sandals and
held a flashlight her face was com-
posed almost stern unless you
caught the bewilderment and pain in
her dark eyes

  come she said well look for
jonah at the house of his grand-
father kali kamalani moana is
there she carried herself with a
dignity which reminded barton of
her royal blood

  out of the house across the lawn
to the trees and through trails which
were weirdly strange to him she
moved ahead the light she carried
pointing straight down from her
swinging arm snatched bits of path
from the darkness and made them
vivid for a brief moment all
around them the night was warm and
still blacker beneath the trees in
contrast to the white moonlit spaces
where the torch faded to nothing-
ness

  on lehua went sure of foot and
direction knowing the way as a noc-
turnal animal knows its way she
carried the flashlight only so that

barton might not delay her by stum-
bling suddenly they emerged into
a moon-bright clearing a small
high house covered with vines stood
before them deeply shadowed by
trees there was a light inside
lehua went to the door and rapped
owai kela a deep voice asked
open the door kali kamalani
the girl called it is lehua with
a friend we come to speak with
those inside

  a moment of silence and then the
door opened and moana and pelio
stepped down into the moonlight
the door closed behind them

  jonah lehua began my father
was killed to-night the wahines
in the kitchen quarters were awak-
ened and they say that you jumped
from the window and ran away in
the rain they think it was your
ghost that somewhere you lie dead
and your uhane came to kill

  but you see i am alive pelio
answered in a puzzled voice i have
been here with my sister and grand-
father lehua you say your father
was killed

  i knew you would not do such a
terrible thing the girl said you
are my friend but what shall we
do now the wahines will tell what
they think they saw you will be
taken to jail

  moana started to cry and pelio put
his arm around her turned to bar-
ton

  what do you advise my friend
pelio asked

  perhaps you had better hide until
the killer is found

  for a long moment pelio was si-
lent a tall brown man like silvered
bronze in the moonlight dark eyes
brooding moana trembled beside
him her head not reaching his shoul-
der her pretty face terrified

  i do not understand he said
finally some one who looks like


street  smiths detective story magazine

me kills and runs away the
wahines say i am a ghost some one
must be wishing my life away

  he turned and tapped on the door
a huge white-haired old man came
down walking erect carrying his
head proudly pelio drew him and
barry to one side away from the
girls

  my grandfather he said this is
mr barton he tells me that i am
in danger will you send a friend
to honolulu at once in my boat
tell him to find out just what the
haole michael normand did when
he went there this day with the eye
doctor tell him to learn if nor-
mand remained at his home or if
he returned to kalani bring the
message to me i will wait in the
inner chamber of the wet cave do
you understand

  i understand the old fellow an-
swered

 what do you understand
moana cried she had overheard her
grandfathers answer and came
quickly to them listen to me it
is all my fault i can find the guilty
man

  hush her grandfather com-
manded softly

  a branch snapped in the deep
shadows and there seemed to be a
movement in the undergrowth
pelio ran into the house and came
down with a small rifle he vanished
into the tangle of shrubbery and
they heard him moving about
stealthily then there was a sharp
report from the blackness

  moana cried out in mortal pain
sagged to her knees and as she
crumpled on the ground they heard
another shot barton caught moana
and laid her down carefully then
he ran for the trees and stumbled
about trying to make his way to the
spot where he had seen that second
orange streak of flame

 come back lehua cried
barry jonah come back
barton stumbled and fell his
knee came down on something hard
and when he put down his hand to
balance himself he found a rifle
his groping fingers next encoun-
tered smooth skin and he knew that
pelio lay there unconscious if not
dead he tried to lift the big fel-
low but inert pelio was too heavy
slipping his arms under pelios
shoulders he raised the senseless
body and dragged it into the open

  lehua was bending over moana
barry laid his burden on the grass
and quickly discovered that a bullet
had creased the side of his head lay-
ing open the scalp it was bleeding
profusely barton tore a strip from
his shirt and pulled the wound to-
gether binding it tightly as he
worked he could hear lehua sobbing
and the rich voice of kali kamalani
chanting a weird wail as he knelt be-
side his granddaughter when bar-
ton joined them moana lay with
closed eyes red creeping across her
breast

  the old man took her by the shoul-
ders little moana he ordered
sternly open your lips tell what
you know of this

  oh dont shake her lehua
sobbed shes dead

 not yet she lives moana
wake you must tell you must
it seemed a horrible act for bar-
ton too thought the little dancer
was gone then she opened her
eyes and looked up into her grand-
fathers face her lips parted my

playhouse in the guava- an

agonizing cough convulsed the little
figure and when it had passed moana
was dead

  she was delirious lehua whim-
pered what is this terrible thing
which stalks around my island mur-
dering people
scorpion on the moon	

 kali kamalani rose and looked
around he saw pelio and moved
over to him lehua cried

  jonah too

 just wounded unconscious
barton told her hell be o k by
to-morrow lehua do you mind if
we take them to your house i can
carry moana while you guide jonah
i must talk with him as soon as he is
rational and he doesnt know his sis-
ter is dead he might want to go to
her

  of course but barry who did
this there must be a madman on
kalani first my father then moana
and now jonah im frightened

  maniac barry barton wondered
grimly just how sane any killer is
would this one strike again to-
night make a clean sweep of it
he didnt think so but there was
something he had to know lehua
im sorry to be insistent to-night
when youve been through so much
but i must know if your father
signed any papers to-day

 i told you about the deed to
kalani which he signed for me
any for michael normand

  i dont know she looked at him
anxiously why

  was there an opportunity for him
to sign them


street  smiths detective story magazine

  michael was alone with him-
at noon he sent me away he
could have had papers with him-i
didnt see them

  i wonder

  barry turned gently gathered
moana up in his arms and carried
her over to the two men pelio was
sitting up both hands clasping his
head eyes blank and staring kali
kamalani stood straight and in-
scrutably silent in the moonlight

 kali kamalani lehua said
gently id like to take them both
to the big house to-night will you
come too

  to-night i will abide under my
own roof i must beseech the gods
he strode into the house and again
the wooden bar slid into place

  lehua urged pelio to his feet try-
ing to help him he mumbled in-
coherently but followed obediently
where she led as they moved away
the shutter opened and again the old
man spoke this time in his native
tongue a deep broken chant

  what does he say barry asked

  he says that death is riding in
on a kona wind lehua shuddered
the terrible konas they make
every one and everything hateful
and ugly but he is right the
trade wind has been dying since mid-
night

  they moved on through the hot
darkness barry found the slight
form growing heavy in his arms he
could hear the wind rising beating
at them in hot dry gusts his cloth-
ing was wet with perspiration

  at the big house they laid moana
on a couch and covered her lehua
went to look f r the servants while
barton made p lio comfortable she
came back to announce that the serv-
ants had all fled

  you must get some sleep bar-
ton advised ill sit with jonah

  to-morrow lehua said with a

deep sigh michael will be back
hell take charge hes marvelous
in times of trouble

  barton bathed pelios wounded
head and bandaged it properly the
big man had seemingly recovered
he sat up and listened while barton
told him moanas last words

  my sister is dead pelio cried
yes that first shot it was a
horrible thing to do

  moanas brother dropped his chin
on his chest and closed his eyes
tears squeezed from the lids and
dropped on his clenched fists after
a long wait barton said

  lehua wants you to rest here to-
night in the morning well hide
you away

  my little sister pelio cried
with savage passion murdered
how can i rest she tried to tell
us something remember she was
saying that she knew

  yes i remember what did she
mean-her playhouse

  i dont know i cant believe

that-

  pelio did you see the killer did
you fire your rifle to-night

  no the big man brushed aside
the interruption no but if moana
spoke of her playhouse with her dy-
ing breath she meant wed find the
answer there im going to see
now to-morrow bring lehua to
me at the wet cave ill tell you
what i have found only moana
and i knew about the playhouse

 his face tightened bleakly
wait normand knew moana was
meeting him there she told our
grandfather to-night

  he rose swiftly staggered for a
moment then took a blanket from
the bed and spread it on a grass mat
rolling them up together without
speaking again he went out bar-
ton did not try to stop him

  the dry kona blew around the
scorpion on the moon



house his high-ceilinged room
seemed stifling although the cur-
tains stood straight out with the
wind some great dark god thrashed
about in the ironwood trees shaking
them with a persistent threatening
roar in imitation of the deep thunder
of surf breaking on the coral reef
the rain clouds were blown from the
sky and the moon moved slowly to-
ward the horizon

  to barton it was a night menacing
beyond any he had known he felt
that he knew the man who had taken
two lives that night and yet he had
no proof it was a clever man in-
telligent ruthless and too deeply
involved to stop now he would go
on in a desperate attempt to accom-
plish his purpose knowing that he
gambled with his own life too

 barton could only defeat him by
being more clever and more ruthless
he had no evidence acceptable to
the law if he merely waited for that
evidence lehua might also be
sacrificed he chafed at his own
inactive role it was worse than
humiliating to himself and ex-
tremely dangerous for others

 as he lay on his bed hot and
dripping he tried to remember that
he was on american soil that only
a few miles away there were police
and prisons but the feeling that he
was in some ungoverned alien land
persisted hauntingly he was im-
patient for daylight

chapter vi
michael returns

arton opened his eyes the
next morning to see the cur-
tains at his windows whip-
ping in the hot wind
goaded by restlessness he got un-
der the shower when he came into
the hallway dressed in whites he
was aware of the hush pervading the

old house yesterday it had been
full of movement life shrill voices
to-day silas macgregor had si-
lenced the gayety in death as he
could not do in life

  barton wandered downstairs and
into the kitchen lehua stood in the
middle of the room she smiled
wanly at barton and lifted her hands
helplessly she wore a white sleeve-
less blouse and shorts her little feet
in sneakers she nodded when he
told her that pelio had left

  im not much of a hostess she
volunteered i cant even make
coffee

  thats what comes of being born
a rich brat barton teased you
can round up some fruit and ill at-
tend to the coffee

  lehua brought golden papaia from
the refrigerator and scraped out
the black seeds while barton went
deftly about his tasks when
they had eaten listlessly and were
dawdling over their coffee he told
her the reason why he was in the
islands

  an insurance detective sent to
investigate my father she re-
peated but why and why are
you telling me this now

 because i believe you are in
danger i want you to trust me-
to believe i know what im talking
about

  you think that the person who
did those horrible things last night
might also kill me

  i think youre in danger he
repeated soberly you remember
that i warned you when your father
went blind

  lehua shuddered closing her eyes
tightly like a frightened child
why should some one go around
my island killing what has hap-
pened to me i have no heartache

b

over my fathers death-just horror
at the way it came to him she
opened her eyes and looked at bar-
ton with a haunted expression do
you believe my father burned his
buildings

  yes

  i hope youre wrong she said
slowly but he might have he
wanted money to buy more land
they called him the baron because
he was so high-handed what dif-
ference will his murder make to you
will you go on with the investiga-
tion

  my client will probably tell me
to stay on the job and either prove
fraud or clear him if we prove
fraud the estate will be asked for a
settlement but there need be no
publicity now

  believe me lehua said ear-
nestly i will pay it back i am rich
and i dont want that kind of
money

  what will you lo now lehua
can i help

  yes by staying here with me
im asking you to do this knowing
that michael may not wish it fa-
ther will be buried on kalani as soon
as the inquest is over after the
funeral ill record the deed to kalani
and tell michael that i cannot marry
him

  did i hear my name michael
normands strong cheerful voice
came from the open window he
was smiling by all the gods you
look lovely lehua im afraid ill
have to insist upon marrying you
michael she cried i thought
you would never come dreadful
things have been happening

oh i say his face showed in-
stant concern right-o coming
his head vanished from the window
barton leaned swiftly toward the

girl say nothing of why im here
he warned

 normand came through the door
and straddled a chair at the table
lehua told him of the murder of her
father the tragic death of moana
and the flight of the servants he
listened soberly and when she had
finished visibly worried and angry
he took her hands bent over her

  you poor darling this is ter-
rible some one must go at once for
the police and a doctor did the
wahines see any one where is
pelio

  thats just it michael the fool-
ish things claim that jonahs ghost
was here last night and killed father
they kept crying uhane uhane
and then while we were away last
night they skipped out she
poured coffee for michael

  thats nonsense about ghosts
michael stirred his coffee scowling
thoughtfully at the spoon in its am-
ber whirlpool and what is this
i hear about you not marrying me
lehua flushed but she met his
eyes gallantly i hadnt meant to
tell you yet but im not going
through with it father is dead and
theres no reason for a loveless mar-
riage now

  michael said softly not love-
less lehua i love you

  pretending not to hear she hur-
ried on i dont want to buy any
more islands i have kalani yes-
terday father signed a deed giving
it to me

  the deeds worthless unless you
marry me michael said silas
knew that when he signed there
is a clause specifying marriage
lehua remembered then the smile
on her fathers lips when he put pen
to the deed and deep hurt showed in
her eyes he had known and was
tricking her to the last
scorpion on the moon



 

  normand said i have no wish to
persecute you but there was no
yielding in his face

  speaking to the girl while his eyes
met squarely those of normand
barry said now that your father
is gone lehua the deed probably
will not matter one way or another
you are his only heir why not de-
stroy the document and forget it
there was no change of expres-
sion in the englishmans eyes he
said curtly you may be right
well get a legal opinion but that
wont help any about the will to
lehua he said of course you
knew about the will appointing me
your guardian as well as your hus-
band

  michael how could you let him
do that

  let did any one ever let your
parent do things he was the law
but that can wait you havent told
me where pelio is

  barton frowned and shook his
head slightly missing his signal
lehua answered frankly

  jonah is hiding in the wet caves
because of what the wahines may
tell ill see him this afternoon
normand rose ill send at once
to honolulu for the authorities and
make the other arrangements
barton gave him the key to mac-
gregors room saying that he had
thought it best to lock the door

chapter vii

terror in the wet caves

here was no auto road
around kalani the steep
cliff formation of ancient
lava eroded in places came
to the very ocean edge modern en-
gineering could have hewed a road
but kalani belonged to the mac-

gregors and they had no wish to
modernize it there were many
trails and it was on one of these that
lehua and barry rode to the wet
caves

  lehua had donned white linen
jodhpurs and oxfords a package
of food for pelio and a big flash-
light were tied to her saddle at
the moment she was glad that the
narrow trail discouraged conversa-
tion she was tired unhappy and
confused

 do you know barton asked
gently that pelio is deeply in love
with you

  she twisted in the saddle to look
back

  is he she asked vaguely her
thoughts were too involved with the
difficulties of her situation to con-
sider the possible passion of an old
playmate i thought he got over
that years ago

  she faced forward again and bar-
ton said

  to the contrary i imagine each
year has only deepened it

  lehua said no more and he fell
silent he had tried to persuade
her to return to honolulu that day
and when she had refused had kept
an unostentatious watch over her

  did you know she asked later
that michael decided to go for the
police himself

  barton brooded over that strange
things had happened while normand
was supposed to be away from ka-
lani what would it be this time
as his mount followed the one
ahead bartons mind was in a tur-
moil behind his calm gray eyes

  lehua pelio even little floana
had all seemed so frank and yec what
did he know of their thoughts and
purposes only that each had secret
desires and clung to them mac-


street  smiths detective story magazine

gregor had merely tolerated him
the big fair englishman had kept
him at arms length only lehua had
been friendly he felt unhappy and
frustrated heartily weary of his
waiting role

 were almost there lehua
called

  her horse crossed a bridge and
beyond it they could see the green
and blue of the sea she dismounted
and he tied their horses to a tree and
took the package of food lehua
went ahead with the flashlight

  a short trail led to the cave en-
trance wide and low in the cliff
inside away from the sunlight and
hot wind it was like another world
lava walls glistened blackly with
seeping water a constant spatting
drip was heard and the rock floor
was wet and slippery they moved
forward daylight faded the
walls crowded closer and the circle
of light from the torch became in-
creasingly important the narrow
tunnel turned and twisted into the
body of the old crater like a tortured
snake barton followed closely
grabbing at the wet walls when his
feet slipped

 almost happily lehua cried
jonah moana and i used to play
here acting out old legends we
loved it

  its not the place id pick for
my children if i had any

 she laughed we ran wild it
was really quite safe where we
played although now and then we
did a bit of dangerous exploring
were almost to jonahs hiding
place as she spoke the passage
widened into a low irregular room
she flashed the light ahead and led
the way to a small opening in one
wall sorry but youll have to
crawl for a way she dropped to
her hands and knees and disappeared
in the bole

  the light which she held back-
ward toward barton bobbed along
and he followed her into the tunnel
beyond he could see a paler light
hear lehua call and pelios answer-
ing aloha nui oe his voice was
eager

  then lehua laid down the flash-
light and slid out of the far end of
the tunnel in another moment bar-
ton had joined her in a great rock
chamber by the light of a lan-
tern he saw pelio on the mat which
made a small island in the damp
floor his head was still bandaged
but he insisted that it no longer
pained him while he ate the food
lehua had brought he told them
that the man sent to report on
michael normand had returned

 to report on michael she
asked i dont understand
youll have to know this pelio
said michael was on this island
last night he took the eye doctor
back to honolulu but he did not stay
there at eight last night he left
his private dock in a small fast mo-
tor boat he did not return home
until four this morning then at
seven he boarded the ulua openly
and came back to kalani

  dark eyes glowing in the lantern
light lehua asked  what does that
mean

  it means that he came here se-
cretly last night that he killed
your father trailed you and barton
to my grandfathers house and shot
my sister when she would have
turned suspicion from me to him
moana knew something and he tried
to silence her when i pursued
he shot me	

 no you are jst guessing
lehua cried how do you know
we know

  i cant believe it its too awful

i wont believe- her halting

whisper rose in shrill uncontrolled
scorpion on the moon



protest not michael he loves
me he wants to marry me he
couldnt kill my father

  it isnt easy to tell you this
but-

  no jonah she interrupted her
voice gentle now youre distracted
with grief for moana this could
not be the truth

  bartons heart ached at this second
gallant refusal to believe evil of her
friends this pathetic faith in their
love and loyalty first pelio now
michael barton took her small cold
hands in his and gripped them
tightly

  you must listen for your own
sake jonah has good reason for
wht he says

  but it cant be true dont you
remember the wahines said it was
jonahs ghost you said yourself
that the man was tall and dark
michael is fair

  there was something i didnt tell
you michael normand is like jonah
in size and build do you know why
the wahines said it was a ghost be-
cause they saw him change color
i saw it too he ran into the pelt-
ing rain and it washed his shoulders
white the moon shone like day
i saw this lehua

  white she whispered her
lips quivered

  yes he was disguised with a
wash of brown stain something he
could remove quickly he disturbed
the servants deliberately so they
would think it was jonah when they
saw him and then the rain and moon-
light betrayed him

  lehua pelio pleaded you re-
member moanas last words

  the girl turned her stricken face
to him her lips moved stiffly to re-
peat without sound those pitiful
words -my playhouse-

  i went there last night pelio
went on moana must have taken

normand there i found-

  you mean that moana and

michael were-were meeting-

  yes thats what she told my
grandfather

  dramatically pelio turned back
the mat and brought out a wig of
wavy black hair and a pair of white
shorts streaked with brown dye he
laid them on the girls knee she
touched them they were soggy wet
and she swept them away with a
violent gesture

   its too terrible i cant bear it
she put her head down on her knees
and hard shudders shook her slim
shoulders

  pelio sat looking at her bowed
head in his eyes a desperate poign-
ant passion his handsome dark face
so rigidly controlled it looked like
stone

  barton said gently if you had
only gone away this afternoon when
i asked you to we might have
spared you this he put his arm


street  smiths detective story magazine

around her shoulders and held her
while she wept

  pelio repeated the story of the
woman in australia of normands
secret love for her his correspon-
dence and his intention to retire
there and marry her dont you
see he finished if you marry him
he becomes your heir and there
would be only your life between him
and great wealth-and the woman he
really loves

  lehua threw back her head the
lantern made little lights dance in
the tears on her cheeks and lashes
michael is rich he could go to

her without all this-

  hes broke pelio contradicted
i am his secretary i know he
knew that your father burned his
buildings and used that knowledge
to force this marriage on you
lehua said piteously you want
me to believe he is a monster
we only want to protect you
barry said do you think you
could act a part face him again
be as you were until i can complete
my case you know we must have
actual proof of guilt

  at that pelio spoke out in des-
perate intensity no you must
not send her back i tell you he has
some other plan ieeit he does
not intend to marry her and he does
not intend to wait it is much better
that i go and kill him in fair fight
no lehua protested there
has been too much killing

  ill go with her barton argued
he cant claim the estate unless he
marries her she will be safe until
they are married and ill watch out
for her what other plan could he
have

  i dont know he is a devil
pelio was stubborn but barton in-
sisted and it was finally settled by

lehua that she would return to the
house and play her part until barton
had worked out his case they told
pelio good-by warning him to stay
hidden until he heard from them

  lehua took the flashlight and
crawled into the tunnel pelio held
barton back and leaned in to call
after the girl

  i almost forgot when i typed
the deed to kalani i left out the
clause about you marrying normand
if your father signed it the island
is all yours

  she shouted her thanks but still
pelio held barton back his dark
eyes burning with the pain of unre-
quited love

  you will watch over her he
urged

  of course i will barton assured
him and tried to think of the right
words to say he failed and turned
to enter the tunnel the flashlight
lay at the other end shining in his
face as he crawled forward

  his head came suddenly against
a rocky barrier with a thud he sat
back and saw that the end of the
tunnel was closed with a flat sur-
face of rock bewildered he pushed
against it it was as solid as the
side of a mountain for one mo-
ment barton had a private spell of
the jitters they were entombed
helpless with his promise to pro-
tect lehua useless

  where was she now who could
have done this were all his careful
deductions haywire the horror of
his helplessness would have in-
creased a hundredfold if he had
known the answers to those ques-
tions an unsuspected element had
taken a part in the tragic tangle of
kalani

  what is it pelio called sharply
what has happened
scorpion on the moon



  weve been shut in and lehua is
on the other side

  the sound that came from pelios
throat was like the death cry of a
wild animal

  come back and let me see he
ordered

chapter viii

 bones of the long dead

arton backed out leaving
the flashlight and pelio
moved in his grunts
throbbed through the tunnel
as he strained and heaved with his
great muscles against the rock bar-
ton thought he heard the hawaiian
sobbing and called to him to come
back he did not at once and barry
waited impatiently his forehead fur-
rowed pulses throbbing

 ka wahi o ka make pelio
chanted the words echoed hol-
lowly

  what do you say

  the place of the dead

  so this was where the native army
had died long ago perhaps that
very rock was the one used to shut
them in

  almost in a panic barton called
come out pelio we must talk
he heard a shuffling movement and
added perhaps you were right

and i should have- he stopped

appalled by the terrible look on
pelios face as the lantern light
shaped it strangely with shadows

  the big man crouched in the open-
ing like some dark spirit of the an-
cient days his face was set as
though he held to life only by the
strength of his locked jaws an-
guish and bitter defeat glowed in
his eyes for the space of a mo-
ment he poised there then he slid
to the floor moving his lips by vis-

ible effort i should never have
let her go

 what do you fear normand is
not on kalani

  neither was he here last night
but he killed my sister pelio
crouched beside the tunnel opening
and rocked from side to side there
is another way out-i alone know it
-but it leads through the place of
the long dead

  then what are we waiting for
barton shouted well be dead
too if we stay here come on fel-
low lets go

 where is she pelio cried
what is happening outside

  his head fell forward in despair
and chin on great chest he sat silent
so long that barton touched his
shoulder

  lets get started he said crisply
pelio looked up eyes fearful and
shook his head

  what is it barton demanded
cant you find the way

  the spirits of the dead will shine
against us i promised never to
disturb them again

  instinctively the white man knew
that the modern educated pelio was
submerged at this moment of stark
reality beneath his primitive fears
and superstitions not far enough
had he come from the beliefs of his
ancestors who worshiped dark gods
of battle and vengeance

  pelio he urged the spirits will
give back your promise we are try-
ing to save lehua the gods must
love her too theyll help us
pelio searched his eyes and slowly
a smile broke the mask of his face
he stood to his full magnificent
height and lifted his shoulders
you are right they will help us
he took up the lantern and let it
shine on barton we must swim


street  smiths detective story magazine

a lake and dive beneath a wall i
must have a rope to guide you help
me

  he squatted again and began tear-
ing the blanket into strips tying the
pieces together as he worked he
told a strange story of guiding a
young geological student down from
the crater through the blowholes
they had penetrated to a new low
and found water the student had
argued that they must be behind the
wet caves he stripped and dived
and after several futile attempts
found an underwater passage he
returned to insist that pelio come
too and they emerged into the pool
over there he pointed into the
darkness

  there they had encountered the
ghosts of the dead warriors pelio
had been too frightened to tell of
this experience-too fearful of the
revenge of the uhanes barton lis-
tened thrilled by the daring of the
young student anticipating some-
what the difficulty of their own
escape

  the rope was finished pelio tied
one end to bartons waist and the
other to his own then he led the
way with the flashlight barry car-
ried the lantern they crawled
through another low wide passage
and emerged into a lofty chamber
something shifted under foot and
barton looked down

  human bones skulls femurs
ribs-the lost army no wonder the
hawaiian had feared to enter here
he felt a tug at the woolen rope and
picked his way to where pelio
waited below them the light was
reflected on black water-smooth si-
lent dead the opposite wall
seemed very far away

  we leave the lantern here pelio
said ill take the flashlight but
it may be no good after the swim
come

  as barton put down the lantern
pelio struck the still water with
hardly more splash than a dropped
stone barton followed little blue
lights clung to them with a weird
glow as they swam to the other wall
where the dim rays of the lantern
barely carried barton knew now
that these phosphorescent lights
were what pelio had thought to be
ghosts of the dead warriors it must
have taken desperate courage for
him to enter that lake again

  now they had brought up to tread
water by the wall pelio was mut-
tering about the lake being paved
with the bones of the dead whisper-
ing broken prayers for protection
v the opening under this wall leads
to a larger room he panted from
that room we can reach the mountain
top through blowholes made when
the lava cooled ages ago wait
he untied the rope from his waist
and handed the end to barton i
must locate the passage from this
side

  barton watched him vanish with a
queasy feeling pelio represented
his only hope of escape unless who-
ever had shut them in should return
to free them suppose the swimmer
never came up from that black lake
but in a few moments tiny blue
lights disturbed the water and
pelios head broke the surface he
took a deep breath and again fas-
tened the rope about him

  i will dive you follow the
rope will guide you if the uhanes
try to trick you with their lights
follow me

  his body arched into the water
and phosphorescence marked its
downward going that was the last
barton was to see of pelio for many
hours he filled his lungs dived in
and swam with the rope open-eyed

  down down down long vigor-
scorpion on the moon



ous strokes his lungs began to ache
for relief and still they went down
would pelio never turn how
much longer could his bulging eyes
follow that lighted progress ah
the blue specks were rising barton
followed turned and felt a pull on
the rope he shot to the surface to
expel his breath in painful relief and
fill his lungs again it was pitch
dark but the air was cool and fresh
treading water he heard the ha-
waiian draw great gulping breaths

  give me your hand pelio said
he put bartons hand on his shoul-
der ordered him to hold tight and
struck out slowly through the black-
ness after a few yards he said
rock go easy

  barton felt his hand taken and
let himself be guided out onto the
rocks in another moment he stood
dripping beside pelio in darkness
blacker than the eternal night of
hell he felt hollow and lost and
forced his mind away from panic and
the insane consequences should pelio
fail to find his way through the
crater another idea had been giv-
ing him a bad time-what if one
of the frequent earthquakes these
islands endured had clogged the pas-
sage above with rock

  he heard pelio snap the flash-
light and throw it to the floor with
a furious exclamation when it failed
to light the rope about his waist
pulled and barton drew up the slack
as he followed his guide

  barton could never put into words
his experience in the following
hours they were double-distilled
torture always on the edge of panic
which would have meant their death
of thirst and exhaustion had they
given in to it that slow blind climb
in stygian darkness was the basis
for many future nightmares from
which he would wake covered with

  ds-

cold perspiration and filled with the
conviction that he was still stagger-
ing through the dark depths of a
mountain cracking his head on low
spots falling down inclines leaving
his skin on rough walls all the time
clinging to that rope of wool

  the strange maze of low ceilings
sharp rocky openings and tilted
floors he could only liken to the work
of a giants child blowing soap bub-
bles with hot lava a cluster of them
had frozen solid into a mountain and
the air pressure forced a passage
until it reached the top bubble
when that one burst it created the
crater of this dead volcano

  how do you know where we are
going he panted once just to hear
his voice in the bleak silence

  he heard pelio gulp back the lump
in his throat before answering and
even then his voice was unsteady

  partly by instinct partly by the
air-when i take the wrong turn it
goes dead the kids used to call me
the owl they said i could see in
the dark it is true that i have an
instinct for direction even on
strange roads and in strange places

  barton kept telling himself that
it wasnt really happening to him
that he was having a bad dream and
would waken soon then hed hear
pelio curse in the blackness ahead
would crouch back against the rock
wall to let the big fellow retrace his
steps to a new start and fear would
again take him by the throat not
only fear for himself and pelio but
for lehua outside r a best guess
as to what had happened to her was
only a wild shot and he knew it

  their first warning that they
neared the surface was a new warmth
in the air the second a pale-gray
blur of light coming around many
corners ahead finally with inex-
pressible relief they were squirming
up through the last fissure to find

the sun had set and a bright moon
was rising silently they dropped to
the earth exhausted

bartons riding clothes were torn
and filthy the bandage on pelios
head was wet with fresh crimson and
their hands arms faces and shins
were bleeding the kona still blew
in sultry gusts and black clouds
moved swiftly ahead of the moon
where are we barton gasped
far side of ridge no use hop-
ing for the horses normand would
not leave them we must go afoot
i dont believe it was normand
suppose you walk into a trap
they cannot hurt me now pelio
rose a splendid figure terrible with
his grim bloody face i go to find
lehua

  again barton felt that he was far
from cities and laws and the firm
hand of uncle sam he closed his
eyes against the unreality and tried
to remember little common things
the modern kitchen at the big house
the nickel and porcelain equipment
the electric regrigerator this is
america he told himself i will
keep my head  i will

  come pelio said

 as barton followed down the
rocky side of the old crater he knew
that he must not let this man out
of his sight

chapter ix

the fire goddess

 d renched one minute by
sudden showers dried the
next by the hot wind bar-
ton and pelio worked their
way through the underbrush on the
sides of the volcano until they struck
a trail which passed above the cliffs
below they could hear the surf
pounding piled in huge combers by
the wind as they rounded a cliff

promontory a dull-red glow lighted
the sky

  pele jonah cried

  pele the fire goddess bartons
throat grew dry was that the big
house burning he thought then
of that small box in the attic had
he been wrong in thinking mac-
gregor had placed it there had
some one else supplied the missing
matches where was lehua the
stinging odor of wood smoke
whipped across his face he had
left the box for evidence he would
never forgive himself if his decision
had brought about the loss of kalani
house

  with a wild cry pelio plunged
ahead on the trail and barry raced
after him his heart filled with hor-
rified pity for this strange man and
his hopeless love he dared not be
separated from pelio without a
guide he might be hours finding his
way

  not so fast he called and his
companion slowed to a swift trot
partly by sound partly by help of
the moonlit spaces between trees
partly by stark necessity barton
kept near him they came at length
to the beach and found the horses
still tied to the tree reeling with
fatigue they mounted and turned to-
ward that red glow a few minutes
later they galloped into the clear-
ing and reined up

  lehuas beloved home was in ruins
the horses snorted and danced away
from the blaze now a welter of flam-
ing timbers and walls barton dis-
mounted turned his horse toward
the trees and gave it a slap the
animal trotted away he heard a
cry and turning his back on the fiery
inferno barton saw a movement in
the heavy foliage and ran that way

  it was lehua sitting against a
tree her ankles bound hands tied
scorpion on the moon



behind her back she was weeping
hysterically pelio joined them as
barry attacked the ropes he talked
gently steadily as he worked but it
was some time before they got her
quieted and heard a story of sheer
terror and of a majestic tragic ges-
ture to the ancient goddess of
hawaii

 some one-she didnt see who-
had struck her on the head as she
emerged from the tunnel and when
she recovered consciousness she was
lying on the grass here at the foot
of the tree unable to do more than
hitch into an upright position she
was alone and when she called old
kali kamalani paced majestically
from the house

  he was wearing the priceless yel-
low and red feather kings cape from
the macgregor collection around
his ankles were dog-tooth anklets
about his neck the ancient lei palaoa
-necklace of braided human hair
with its carved hooklike ornament
of human bone

  lehua had asked him to free her
and he refused speaking only in his
native tongue she begged him to
go back and release the men in the
cave but he told her they were to
die there and she must never never
tell where they had gone or the gods
would be angry

  she was terrified and prayed that
she might not lose her mind and
leave her friends to a horrible death
she tried to reason with the old man
reproaching him bitterly for what he
had done he insisted that both
pelio and barton were her enemies
that he had saved her from them he
said that he would not hurt her but
moana had loved wrongly and been
killed so he must pacify the god-
dess pele with an offering so she
would intercede for moanas uhane

  he turned and stalked away from
me lehua sobbed i called after

him but he never even turned his
head he went into the house and
in a moment flames sprang up about
the lower floor i saw him again at
the window of the room where
moanas body lay his face turned up
to heaven arms raised i screamed
and screamed no one came she
drew up her knees in the circle of
her arms and wept on them

  rain began to fall again but the
three at the base of the tree did not
notice

  the old boy had what it takes
barton said and was secretly grate-
ful that the fire had not started with
that cute little arson trick in the
attic drops hissed against the red
coals of the fire and steam rose to
mingle with the thick smoke

  pelio knelt beside lehua and took
her hand pathetically humble and
adoring you will forgive my
grandfather he was only an igno-
rant old man who went lolo

  i forgive him it was terrible
but it was splendid too lehua
drew her hand from his jonah
she began in a troubled voice kali
kamalani told me that this morning
he found the body of moanas lover
crushed on the rocks below the cliffs
he brought it to kalani house it
was cremated with the bodies of
moana and my father jonah he
also told me that it was not michael
who shot moana that you knew
moana loved michael hopelessly and
that the big fair haole had never
made love to her if that is true
how could you let me think that
michael had been cruel to her that
he killed her to keep her lips
sealed

  my grandfather did not know
what he was saying pelio pleaded
his voice rose wildly lehua be
kind to me i love you so

  you must not speak of love
kali kamalani said- oh look


street  smiths detective story magazine

she pointed toward the ocean

  through the rain they saw nor-
mands red cruiser rounding the
headland cutting swiftly through
the waves to the dock

  michael leaped to the float leaving-
two brown-faced uniformed police
and a white man to tie up the cruiser
he hurried ashore and up the path
to the group at the base of the tree
and took lehuas hands in his

 what has happened your home
-you poor little darling

  she tried to speak choked up and
began to cry again but she took her
hands out of his barton started to
explain and pelio stood erect for
a long moment he stood as if in a
daze looking at them then he turned
and walked away toward the water
he had reached the coral wall when
normand looked up and saw him
he rose and raced across the lawn
barton and lehua ran after them

  they were in time to see pelio
swing the ulua away from the float
normand made a splendid running
dive into the water and grabbed at
the cruiser as it slid past picking
up speed

  barton feverishly stripped the
canvas covering from a small speed-
boat while lehua cast off the line
the shower had passed leaving rain
and tears blended on her cheeks
the policemen who had gone up to
look at the fire came running back
one of them in time to jump aboard
as they headed for the sea

  they could see normand hoisting
himself over the side of the ulua in
another moment the big cruiser made
a wide swing apparently out of con-
trol and headed straight for the reef
moonlight made the scene as vivid
as day two figures appeared on her
deck struggling in mortal combat
as barton watched they went over-
board locked together and vanished

beneath the surface he headed for
the spot

  lehua screamed and pointed the
ulua struck the reef leaped high
and settled down in a welter of white
foam

 what is jonah doing lehua
cried theyll be drowned

  barton didnt answer the small
speedboat closed in rapidly on the
two heads now bobbing about so
close together in the water it was
a struggle to the death na mano
pelio had said one of us will be
shark meat they were still in-
side the reef and there were no
sharks there but pelio had been a
swimmer almost since birth-it
would be murder if-

 take the wheel barton
shouted to the police officer
slow

  he ran to the gunwale and grabbed
a boat hook as they drew along-
side barely maintaining headway
he cracked pelio over the head with
the boat hook lehua cried out in
protest but barton ran along the
side and extended the hook to nor-
mand who was now holding pelio
up with his left arm he grasped the
hook and barton drew them close
the man at the wheel manipulated
the speed boat skillfully while lehua
helped pull up pelios limp body and
then haul the englishman aboard
the officer headed back toward the
float

 thanks normand panted
close call no match for him in the
water hes part seal and part
shark drowned me sure if you
hadnt knocked him out

 it was you he was after from
the beginning barton said

  right-o all those clever lies
better tie the beggar up before he
recovers from that wallop you gave
him hes not to die until he sets
a few things right again
scorpion on the moon



 what are you talking about
lehua demanded

 michael said when did you
catch onto his game barton

  i was sure last night when he
was shot in the head i fell down
in the dark onto his rifle and the
barrel was hot he denied having
fired it of course his own wound
was self-inflicted

 and you understand michael
said sadly that he did not mean
to kill his sister he was shooting
to frame me he loved her dearly
i believe that but we have the
bullet from moana it will hang
him barton finished tying pelios
hands and stood up

 michael lehua asked again
what are you talking about barry
warned me against you he said you
killed my father

  barton interrupted pelio said
it and i let you believe him i had
to make him think i was still blind
and dumb

  then it really was jonah her
voice was still incredulous

  all the time my dear michaels
face was grim now his eyes bleak
he probably aimed at barton when
he shot moana-must have known
he was getting close to the truth
michael leaned toward the girl look-
ing her steadily in the eyes

  lehua there never was anything
between moana and me she told
her brother that story because she
vanted to punish me for loving you
there never has been any one but
you

  i know kali kamalani told me
but why did jonah do this to me
the bound man groaned and rolled
into a sitting position

  because he loved you michael
said simply he was sick heart
and soul with love for you i think
he hoped to drag your father down

to his size that way-to bring you
within his reach

 barton said what about last
night normand that was you i
saw running from the house wasnt
it

 michael nodded he told them
about returning to watch over
lehua frantic with fear for her
safety disguised to prevent recogni-
tion should he meet pelio i lost
him at the house and went in to
search for him it was then that my
clumsiness woke the wahines i
heard him outside and made a run
for it following him to the cabin i
didnt know what he had done in
the house until the next morning
you played right into his hands
barton said destroyed your own
alibi and you might have needed
one pretty badly everything
pointed to you did you know that
pelio found the wig and shorts you
wore

  the beggar had all the breaks
until his bullet killed his sister
lehua whispered kali kama-
lani knew pelio killed her he
didnt tell me but thats why he was
so implacable-leaving him to die
in the caves poor proud old man
confess barry broke in to di-
vert lehua from that terrible
memory that you faked that second
will normand

  michael grinned i had a wild
notion that if i could induce lehua
to marry me i might win her back
he turned to her you did love
me once didnt you

  he took her hand and she let it
stay in his

  barton leaned down to look into
pelios face tell me he asked
did macgregor know you burned
down his properties

  for a long moment pelio remained


street  smiths detective story magazine

silent a dark figure on the deck
then he did not know i fixed
it so he couldnt prove his innocence
so i could disgrace him unless he
let me marry lehua but i made one
big mistake i sent for you i
thought i could use you

  the boat rocked gently against the
float normand had his arm around
lehua and her head lay on his shoul-
der barton and the police officer

helped pelio out made fast the boat
and led the big fellow away

  in his heart the insurance detec-
tive was sorry that pelio had not
gone out alone to make his atone-
ment in the night-black sea to end
his life in a savage battle with the
sharks thats what pelio would
have wished but that was not the
way of the law and at long last the
law had come to kalani

ghouls steal -pound statue

nrreverent but industrious thieves stole two historic cannons
and a  pound statue from graves in rockland cemetery at
t sparkill new york the booming market for scrap metal on
war demands is presumed to have inspired the taking of the
memorials

   the cannons captured by american forces at vera cruz during the
mexican war were taken from the grave of general john charles fremont
famed explorer a conqueror of california and republican candidate for
president in  the statue was taken from the grave of doctor alexander
johnston chalmers skene internationally known gynecologist

    the statue of bronze was six feet in height it was the figure of a
draped woman standing beside the tomb and holding a palm leaf over the
memorial to doctor skene

    state troopers believe the thieves chose a moonlight night for their
depredations it would have been impossible to lift the statue to a truck
without a derrick the troopers said using crowbars and derrick and a
crew of men the thefts must have required several hours to complete it
is thought on a hill overlooking the hudson river the cemetery is in an
isolated spot and the work of the ghouls was not immediately discovered


thubway thams
thothial thecurity

 by johnston mcculley

   author of thubway tham and the stars etc

         up irom tne distant river tne
 warm sun benevolently bathed the
 earth men and women hurried about
 their duties with faint smiles upon
 their faces the world seemed at
 peace and people at peace with the
 world

  but thubway tham the little
 pickpocket whose nimble fingers
 helped him follow the path of least
 resistance through life was not in
 tune with the fine day

  as was his habit thubway tham
 sat on a bench in madison square
 early that afternoon watching the
 passing parade but he had no keen
 interest in it to-day the comings
 and goings of the citizenry did not
 intrigue him he was thinking
 deeply his brow furrowed and his
 eyes narrowed

  detective craddock wandering
 around in the hope that he would
 happen to see a man for whom the
 police were looking saw tham and
 approached him slowly craddock
 knew from experience that whenever
 tham had a deep thinking spell it
 was followed by an emotional out-
 burst so to speak and the outburst
 generally was followed by an epi-
 demic of watches and wallets being
 reported stolen by gentlemen riding
 in the subway

   craddock finally stopped at the
 end of the bench and remained voice-
 less until tham glanced up and saw
 him


street  smiths detective story magazine

  hello craddock tham greeted
thit down and take your weight off
your flat feet

  craddock sat down

  tham he said ive been watch-
ing you troubles seem to be heavy
on your soul or is it possible your
conscience is awake at last are you

deeds tham is the day of reforma-
tion at hand

puthled there ith a problem-

  perhaps i may be of service

peated my goodneth craddock

  true tham but you neednt
worry about that one of these days

youll hear the judge sending you
to the big house up the river and

your old age will be taken care of by
legal means youll have a roof
over your head in your declining
years tham-and what a roof you
wont have to worry about eats and
clothes and youll have a number

and your employer thendth in that
and ath much more and the govern-
ment keepth it then when you

ernment the thame amount

  i see you steal a wallet and
then make its owner send in a per-
centage of what you stole some-
thing tells me tham there might be

tinued i do not athume that i am

washington who cannot make head

tion other sections of our beloved

goin to think thome of it for my old
age

  and where are you going to get
this coin tham

  wouldnt you like to know
craddock about to make a warm
reply had his attention distracted
a short distance away two men in-
dulged in hot words and were in-
clined to come to blows there be-
ing no uniformed policeman handy
detective craddock moved quickly
in that direction thubway tham
arose from the bench and moved
quickly in another

  the idea of a sinking fund ap-
pealed to thubway tham he would
start a savings account he decided
make a habit of depositing money
in the bank and watch his fortune
grow he would put by something

saoe aeveralcents a pack try avalon cigarettes cellophane terap union made


street  smiths detective story magazine

against the day when his back would
be stooped his eyes watery his hair
thin and gray and his hands shaky
but to do all this he first had to
have the money

  assured that craddock was not
following him tham strolled over
to broadway and up it enjoying the
fine day he finished a cigarette as
he reached times square tossed the
remnant of it into the gutter and
descended to the subway platform

  it was too early for the wild rush
of humans trying to get home from
business the hour when thubway
tham did his best work but he
boarded an uptown local and traveled
as far as columbus circle where he
ascended to the street to kill time

  fate must have taken him there
for the circle was not one of thams
usual haunts he started walking
around it and stopped at the fringe
of a small crowd in the center of
the crowd a man stood atop a box
to which a flag was affixed waving
his arms and bellowing in stentorian
tones to defeat and overcome the
rumble of traffic

  this particular soap box orator
interested thubway tham because
of his appearance he was a huge
man with a mop of dark hair which
kept tumbling into his eyes and
which he continually brushed aside
with a magnificent gesture he
seemed to be the physical combina-
tion of well-known dictator and a
fairly well-known labor leader

  only another trick to get your
dimes he was roaring its taken
from your wages oh yes the em-
ployer has to meet the amount and
send it in but the employer is in a
position to cut your wages more than
enough to pay his percentage so-
cial security is it for whom for
you my downtrodden brothers no
more security for the capitalistic
tyrants who grind mens souls into

the dust

  tham had heard a lot of loose talk
like that but he remained to listen
because the orator was talking about
social security and because tham
liked to watch him brush his hair out
of his eyes

  without realizing it tham moved
closer worked in toward the impro-
vised rostrum as the crowd eddied
and surged then he was standing
almost under the orators waving
arms

  you and you are the victims the
speaker cried and you he
pointed directly at tham and paused
to gather his thoughts and draw in
his breath brother he asked
looking at tham whats your line
of work

  well i-im in the leather buthi-
neth tham replied

  a worthy pursuit here is a gen-
tleman in the leather business my
brothers no doubt they dock his
pay for this social security his
envelope is a few cents short each
week he could use those few cents
no doubt to buy cheap cigarettes-
such as he is smoking now cheap
cigarettes while his boss smokes ex-
pensive havana cigars is that not
correct my friend

 yeth and no tham replied
boldly

  and what do you mean by that
my friend

  thith ith not a cheap thigarette
and i have no botth

  he has no boss there you are
another man wandering around out
of work perhaps going hungry at
times perhaps sleeping in the park
perhaps looking hopelessly into an-
other dawn-

  i am my own botth tham in-
terrupted

  youre your own boss are you
perhaps we have made a mistake
perhaps you are not a brother per-
thubway thams thothial thecurity



haps you yourself employ poor
downtrodden men and take from

their wages perhaps-

 perhapth yourthelf tham
growled

  who sent you here to heckle
me the orator cried what mil-
lionaire is trying to stop my mouth
but it cannot be stopped no gen-
tlemen as long as i have strength
and breath to protest against the
cruelties of this modern age with its
unjust methods and unfair schemes
my voicell be heard come up here
-let the brothers see you

  the speaker lurched forward
reached down and got tham by the
coat collar and jerked him forward
tham was forced to put one foot
upon the box to keep from falling
he was as putty in this mans hands
before he realized what was happen-
ing he was on the box beside the
orator the latter holding him with
his left hand twisted into thams
coat collar while his right arm beat
the air in oratorical gesture

  look at him-the minion of the
plutocrats the speaker cried
paid to come here and heckle me
that ith a lie tham squawked
i jutht thaid that i am my own
botth and tho i am

  the grasp on the coat collar tight-
ened and tham felt himself chok-
ing his reaction was a natural one
-he kicked the orator on the shin
the orator howled and loosened his
grip and tham jerked away as the
orator swung at him

  let that little guy alone some-
body in the crowd howled

  and you keep out of this a sec-
ond barked at the first

  it was all that was necessary the
emotionally stirred crowd was keyed
to battle pitch somebody struck
somebody else and the fight was on

thubway tham found himself in
the midst of a seething fighting

mass the orator had been tumbled
from his rostrum and bellowing
with rage charged into the fray
his friends fought beside him and
his foes charged against him thub-
way tham was in the midst of it
wanting nothing except to get away

  whistles blew in the distance
traffic became jammed women re-
treated into shops and men rushed
out to learn the cause of the dis-
turbance

 thubway tham was knocked down
and men trampled over him he got
to his feet and found himself in the
midst of the battle with escape cut
off in every direction he wrapped
his arms around his head and tried
to protect himself

  sirens shrieked in the distance

 the cops cops somebody
screeched

  the fighting mob began scatter-
ing and thubway tham rushed for
the curb with some of the others
from instinct he made for the near-
est subway entrance and shot into it
like a hound-chased rabbit into a
hole

  on the crowded platform he sur-
veyed the damage he had lost his
cap his light-colored suit was
streaked with dirt and grease one
of his fairly new shoes had a cut
across it but he had managed to
protect his head and his face did
not have cut or bruise yet his body
felt as though somebody had been
beating him with a club

  panting half exhausted thub-
way tham leaned against the wall to
await the next train more people
came charging down the stairs and
tham saw the orator again

  he was rather disheveled but grin-
ning another man was with him-
an oily-looking individual thubway
tham distrusted at sight they
stood within a few feet of tham not
seeming to recognize his presence

  it worked the orator was say-
ing that sucker planted himself
in front of me just in time we
can spread this in our paper pluto-
crats send men to break up meeting
-something like that right of free
speech denied well stir the broth-
ers up then at the meeting in the
hall downtown ill be a sort of hero
well grab off a fat collection for a
defense fund-something like that

  great stuff the orators com-
panion agreed

  tham saw the orator brush back
his coat tail to get out a handker-
chief and mop the perspiration from
his face and the blood from his
knuckles in the other hip pocket
tham noticed the orator carried a
wallet

  inwardly tham grinned being
not an earnest and sincere worker
for this and that but a common
chiseler the orator was open to any
wiles tham wished to work on him
and it would be a pleasure for tham
to get that wallet he hoped it con-
tained all the orators available cash

  the cops nabbed about a dozen
the orators friend said

  the orator grinned let em ex-
plain to the judge theyll come out
of it sore at law and order heres
the train

  there was a crowd getting on and
thubway tham jammed into a car
behind the other two but there was
asudden surge of those inside and
he became separated from the orator
and his friend he tried to work
toward them but the train was at
times square before he could do so
and at the times square station the
orator and his friend got off

  so did thubway tham he fol-
lowed them as they crossed to the
express side plainly waiting to catch
a downtown express that was all
right with thubway tham he

  liked to do his nefarious work on a
downtown express he had a regu-
lar routine about it

  well tham settled your problem
yet a voice behind him asked

  he whirled quickly to find detec-
tive craddock standing there

  there are almotht theven million
people in thith town tham said
and i have to run into you

  nothing strange in that tham
ive been prowling around here an
hour or more orders are out to
watch for dips going to take a lit-
tle subway ride

  i am goin downtown tham re-
plied i am goin to the lodgin
houthe of nothey moore where i
live if it ith any of your buthineth
it ith a fine thing if a thitithen cant
go about hith buthineth without you
copth pethterin him all the time
tham had raised his voice and
men and women turned to look
craddocks face grew red the ora-
tor had turned to look also and he
recognized tham he saw that
tham was in an argument and felt
he owed tham something for using
him as a cats-paw

  whats the trouble here the
orator asked

 thith big palooka- tham be-
gan indicating craddock

  annoying you is he maybe id
better slap him down

  thats enough out of you crad-
dock snarled im an officer-

 a cossack yes we have them
even here the orator cried this
was an opportunity he could not
forego a cossack trying to ride

down an inoffensive citizen-

  shut up craddock howled

 ah the right of free speech
-where it is you hear fellow
americans this policeman this
cossack tells me to hold my tongue
thubway thams thothial thecurity



by what right-

  at that instant a downtown local
came in and men and women hurried
across to catch the express on the
local were certain police officers
who had been at the riot in the
circle one of them recognized the
orator

 there he is-grab him he
shouted incitin to riot grab
him

  he barged forward with others at
his heels the orator turned to flee
men and women fell aside before
him to give him a path of escape
thubway tham thrust out a leg
quickly and tumbled the orator on
his nose

  tham fell sprawling on top of him
and others hurled themselves on the
two until it looked like a scrimmage
on the football field there were
blows and shrieks and shouted or-
ders womens screams and chil-
drens plaintive cries

  tham squirmed from beneath the
mass as it started to disintegrate
he reeled back against the wall he
shook his head when craddock asked
if he had been hurt howling some-
thing about cossacks the orator was
led away

  thubway tham started for the
stairs

  thought you were going down-
town tham craddock said

  after thith i think i need thome
freth air tham replied im goin
up to get thome

  i need some too tham crad-
dock informed him grinning

  side by side they ascended to the
street thubway tham was nerv-
ous not for nothing had he tripped
the orator and sprawled across his
body in the right-hand pocket of
his coat tham had the orators wal-
let he had not had an opportunity
to extract the contents and ditch the

leather as long as that wallet was
on his person he was in danger

  still worrying about your social
security tham craddock asked

  that and thome other thingth
tham admitted

  what for instance

  bein pethtered by a cothack
said tham why dont you leave
me alone craddock and purthue
burglarth and men in the thnatch
racket

  most burglars work at night
tham and the snatch racket gents
are being cared for by the g-men
if i trail along with you maybe
ill be doing a public service per-
haps ill preserve the wallets of some
citizens

  lithten craddock i promithe
that i will not lift a leather to-day
word of honor craddock

  thats enough for me tham if
you give me your word i can depend
on it

  i am goin home craddock and
i am goin to thtay there till mornin
unleth i go out to a picthure thhow
i have to figure out thith thothial
thecurity buthineth craddock

  o k tham ill be on my way
craddock grinned and swung off
down the street through the crowd
thubway tham grinned also he
could afford to make that promise
to craddock for he already had
lifted a leather he would put aside
a part of what it contained for his
social security bank account and
with the rest he would sit in a poker
game that night at nosey moores
he never had won in a poker game
yet but perhaps this would be the
night in common with the rest of
humanity thubway tham had hope

  he walked leisurely along a side
street his right hand in his coat
pocket extracted what the wallet
contained tham felt a few papers
but could not be sure money was


street  smiths detective story magazine

there as he passed a trash can he
got the empty wallet out of his
pocket and tossed it into the can

 he gave a sigh of relief the
damning wallet no longer was in his
possession he walked on and
slowly drew from his pocket what
the wallet had contained

 thubway tham growled he held
some newspaper clippings lauding
the efforts of the orator-and a so-
cial security application blank

 not a thent tham muttered
and i promithed craddock that i
would not lift a leather to-day

  it did not occur to tham to break
his promise that thought by some
strange twist of his character was
beyond him he started back toward
the subway fumbled in his vest

pocket for subway fare and an-
other grunt escaped him

  he did not have so much as a
nickel evidently when he had
tripped the orator and made his fly-
ing attack on him on the platform
he had lost the two bills and some
change he possessed out of his
pocket

  oh well to-morrow ith another
day tham muttered

  he straightened his shoulders re-
turned to broadway and faced
downtown with short jerky
strides he began his journey it was
many many weary blocks to the
lodging house of nosey moore

  thothial thecurity thubway
tham mused it ith a good thing
if you can get it

the rebels

      he news room of the plains
city express was almost
empty desks marched up
the barren room in staggered
phalanxes the sun of early evening
streamed through the row of win-
dows along one side and made the
scarred desks the dusty and stained
woodwork look old and tawdry

  the fellow who called himself bill
eagles let his gaze march over the
rows of desks to the big desk behind
the tiny railing where some kind of
conference was in process his
wide mouth was drooped at the cor-
ners in a smile that made him look
as though he were smiling to him-
self he was tall and loose jointed

with a face that was brown and rub-
bery looking his eyes were the
brown of a spaniel with little puck-
ers of wrinkles at the corners as
though they were perpetually drawn
in the smile that rode so easily on
his wide mouth

 the man at the desk behind the
railing was stoop shouldered and
big knuckled his face was deeply
lined and dropped in sour contours
his eyes were small and shrewd and
twinkled like bits of gray metal he
rested on his elbows and kept his
eyes on the door while he listened
to the girl who talked to him

  the girl leaned on clenched fists
and wagged her head vehemently as
she talked light caught in her hair
and made it gleam like red gold
her eyes were as blue as sapphires
by b b

and shone now with something be-
tween anger and desperation

 her voice came across the news
room to bill in little stabbing jerks
of sound i tell you mr benson
ive got something dont drag me
off let me go through with this i
can turn this town inside out if
youll only give me a chance

 the man at the desk lifted his
head and said hush hush his
voice had a bitter edge as he went
on why turn it inside out what
would you do with what you found
it would only jump out from under
the wreckage and bite your pretty
head off anyway the express
isnt doing any crusading right now
forget it

  for just a second the smile left
bills mouth leaving it hard and

thin of lips the brown eyes hard-
ened and narrowed he knew this
layout he had heard of it before
he came to plains city the man
was hush benson city editor of
the express he got his name from
his habit of saying hush when
any anyone came in with anything
hot the girl was joan digby her
father had been deadline digby
veteran newspaperman he had
tried to push something too hot over
the deadline and had been found in
an alley with four slugs in his chest
it only went to show that turning
up hot stuff in plains city wasnt
too healthy

  there was a third person in the
news room his desk was some lit-
tle way from the railing he was
leaning forward his elbows on his

ds-


street  smiths detective story magazine

desk his chin resting in his cupped
hands he seemed to be reading a
paper spread out on the desk bill
eagles saw that he was listening in-
tently taking in everything hush
benson and joan digby were say-
ing

  hush bensons voice drifted across
the news room when old man
craig was alive this used to be a
newspaper he had a string of
sheets that tore hell out of the cities
they held down dirty politics and
hidden crime got pulled out into the
open craig was a newspaperman
but he had to die and now who
runs the paper his voice was
harsh and biting an estate a
damned cold-blooded board of trus-
tees who look after things for a
young snipe who plays his way
around the world the trustees
want profits so they put managing
editors in who can show profits to
hell with crusading to hell with
the power of the press to hell
with everything but profits

  his voice got soggy and heavy
i used to run a paper now i run
a billboard for mayor macgaffery
a sheet for a district attorney made
of putty a bulletin for fat slobs
like chief anderson to sound off
their stuff in honest joan if i
didnt have a wife and three kids
id get the hell out and go into some
other game

  all three looked up and saw bill
eagles at the same time the dark
fellow lifted his chin out of his
hands and showed a pair of hard
lips a lean jaw and hard black eyes
joan digby straightene  and her
red-gold hair made a halo against
the light from the windows hush
bensons eyes narrowed as he
growled

  well what do you want

  bill ambled across the room and
leaned negligently over the railing

his battered hat dangled on one long
bony finger the puckers at the
corners of his eyes were more pro-
nounced and his wide mouth wid-
ened in his easy grin

  i heard he drawled that you
were looking for a newspaperman
ive been working on the garrison
blade i thought maybe you could
use me

 a newspaperman hush ben-
sons voice was a snarl hell we
dont want any newspapermen he
stood up a big-boned man with the
tragedy of impotence in his face
he thrust a bony hand toward bill
and raged on

  ill tell you what we want we
want a guy who will hoof around
town and come back with a story
that reads it is rumored that little
bo peep is missing some sheep
interviewed chief anderson de-
clared little bo peeps flock is
safe in plains city we assure the
public that all of them will be back
in their fold before this time to-
morrow every man on the force
has his orders to spare no pains
the sheep will be home behind lit-
tle bo peep

  joan digby smiled and the smile
wasnt so pretty as a smile should
be on a face like hers the lean
fellow pivoted his body on an elbow
and stared impassively as hush ben-
son raved

  ill tell you what we want we
want more stories that read ding
dong dell pussys in the well who
put her in district attorney bas-
sett reiterating his faith in the
plains city police force said un-
doubtedly the work of the little
johnny green gang from upper
podunk we will show these out-
of-town hoodlums that plains city
makes short work of such as they
thats what we want to hell with
newspapermen
crimson deadline



 he shrugged and his shoulders
drooped tiredly what the hell
his face sagged in new lines as he
said heavily yes we want a re-
porter see the managing editor
clint williams if he thinks youre
safe hell hire you

  bill took his weight off the railing
and stood up he saw that joan
digby was studying him measuring
him with her eyes he grinned
broadly and she turned with a sniff
of disgust

 when will mr williams be in
benson glanced at the clock
hell be here any time now

 as he turned away bill caught
the eyes of the silent man on him
they were shrewd calculating eyes
that gave no hint of what the fellow
was thinking bills smile faded a
little this fellow looked like
something other than a mere re-
porter hed have to make it his
business to get a line on him

 bill lounged in a chair by the
door until he saw the brisk well-
groomed figure of clint williams
cross the news room toward the
door marked managing editor
williams was tall with a pair of
nice shoulders and the carriage of
an athlete he glanced at bill
briefly and strode to his office

 bill got a better picture of the
man as he faced him across the desk
he had a manner as brisk as his
walk he gave the impression of
smart efficiency devoid of any senti-
ment or silly scruples he sounded
like that as he talked to bill after
he had questioned him regarding ex-
perience and background

 the day of muckraking is over
in the newspaper world he said
crisply the times demand the
news uncolored by romantic non-
sense and clean of innuendoes and
implications the express is the
leading paper in a city rather de-

void of melodramatic happenings
we want that kind of news do
that and youll be all right get
boyish ideas of crusading and youll
only run into trouble i hope you
understand me

  yes bill said slowly i guess
i get you im kinda like that my-
self i know how to keep my
nose clean i figure the other fel-
low does if he doesnt i figure
its none of my business

 exactly williams snapped
report to benson hell give you
your assignments turn in the stuff
we want and youll be all right
so bill went back to the enclo-
sure behind the railing and faced
hush bensons sour scorn while he
listened to orders the story was
all there part of it in the face of
the city editor who represented the
school of hard-bitten hard-hitting
newspapermen who drag in the news
in spite of hell and high water the
rest of it was in the face of the man-
aging editor who believed in profits
with safety and comfort

  bill thought of men like deadline
digby and old rush craig who kept
his editors on his toes and made his
chain of newspapers respected by
honest men and feared by every
crooked politician in the area they
covered but now old craig and
deadline were dead and men like
williams bossed the job bill
glanced over at the weary droop of
hush bensons shoulders his gaze
traveled over the dark lean reporter
he now knew as dell priest and his
jaw tightened they came to rest
at last on joan digbys red head
and his grin came back

  he tried to know both joan digby
and dell priest better during the
next few weeks without much suc-
cess priest met his advances with
a cold impassivity that might mean
anything or nothing joan was


street  smiths detective story magazine

openly contemptuous her con-
tempt deepened as she saw the stuff
he brought in nice little stories
handed out at city hall sonorous
bursts of hot air from police chief
anderson or hal bassett the dap-
per district attorney

  in a way bill admired her for her
stand on the stories sometimes he
wondered just how long he could
carry in such tripe himself but
always the muscles of the big jaw
tightened and the brown eyes
glowed with a deep light and then
he went back to his beat affable
smiling as harmless in appearance
as a stray pup

  all the hot spots in town knew
him in time the bartenders and
waiters were his pals and every-
where he went he ambled along in
the same loose-jointed indolent
way he never lost his smile his
brown eyes remained as sleepy as
ever but he listened and remem-
bered things he heard and men
talked carelessly in front of him
he had the inborn knack of allaying
suspicion and arousing a sort of
contemptuous tolerance among the
wise boys

  a month from the time when he
had first ambled into the express
office bill lounged through the rail-
ing and tossed two sheets of copy on
hush bensons desk and watched
him with his sleepy eyes very bright
and expectant he watched the red
creep up under bensons collar
around his ears and up into the
scanty gray hair and his wide smile
grew more crooked and lopsided

  benson finished reading the copy
opened his mouth to speak but only
made thick gasping sounds out of
the corner of his eye bill saw dell
priest shift in his chair his ear
toward the city desk his dark face
hard and alert

  when words finally came from

hush benson they came in a rush-
ing torrent that i should live to
see this kind of drivel pouring
through this news room

  he stabbed the copy with a bony
finger and read in a thick voice
the body found beside the turner-
ville pike has been identified as that
of frank crossetti a chicago gang-
ster wanted in a half dozen cities
on various charges ranging from
murder down the scale police
chief anderson declared that the
killing was without a doubt one
of gang vengeance crossetti had
sought safety in peaceful crime-
free plains city but his killers
had found him struck and van-
ished

  benson put his head in his hands
and rocked it from side to side
frank crossetti has been in this
damned sinkhole of a town for six
months hes been taking orders
from the higher-ups and doing his
stuff for them he was the big mus-
cle man for the extortion racketeers
of course he was wanted half the
crooks in plains city are wanted
thats why they come here where
they can lay up and be safe as long
as they play ball with anderson
bassett macgaffery and whoever it
is heads their unholy line-up we
know that we know a hell of a lot
more than that and what do we
do we print this sort of cock-
eyed hooey

  clint williamss voice was like a
whiplash benson you know the
policies of this paper are you try-
ing to disrupt the news room force

  bill swiveled around on one heel
and stared at williams whose face
was white with rage and passion
his eyes were bright and hot ive
told you a thousand times he
snapped that we are running a
paper that keeps its nose clean
maybe things are not just as wed
crimson deadline



like them the only thing we could
do would be to get ourselves in-
volved in libel suits that would
practically wipe us out you know
that you know what happened two
years ago that court decision
against us cost us one hundred thou-
sand dollars a few more like that
and were sunk

  libel suits benson rasped bit-
terly loss of profits cripes
man the city is going to hell under
our feet and were not doing a damn
thing about it election time three
months off and not a decent candi-
date in the field we could have
hollister running for mayor if this
sheet would back him an honest
man running against a fat crook
and we could put him over

  williams opened his mouth to
speak but bensons voice rose to a
hoarse bellow libel suits sure
we lost our case and why be-
cause some dirty son sold us out
somebody tipped off the crooks and
they covered up

  williamss voice was icy youve
had your say benson now ill
have mine im running this paper
i turn in profits and the craig es-
tate is satisfied as long as im
here ill run it my way i suppose
i could get all steamed up and
launch a program of civic reform
when it was all over there wouldnt
b-e any express and the same men
would still be in office i know what
im talking about i know how this
paper is going to be run if you
dont like it you know what you
can do

  hush bensons face went gray and
cold yeah he said harshly i
know what i can do and i think
ill do it maybe im through
maybe im licked but there are
worse things than going on relief
williams

  his somber eyes began to glow

and the lines of his face went deeper
and tauter i know what i can do
i can use some of the stuff i know
and if some of the rats knew how
much ive collected sitting right
here at this desk theyd start look-
ing for holes right now i know
what i can do all right and im
going to start doing it im going
to start a one-man campaign of my
own watch williams hell is
going to open in this town

  bill jerked farther around as he
heard joan digbys voice as cold
and sharp as sleet not alone
hush i know when im through
im in on this with you ive got a
few notes to add to your collection
of facts

  her eyes looked very dark and
shining against the pallor of her
cheeks as she went on in a strained
hard voice my father was a
newspaperman williams he had
too much nerve and honesty to play
your game he went after the
crooks you know what happened
he was killed in the line of duty
and not a thing was done about it
his killers are still loose ive tried
to work on your sheet hoping to
turn something up ive turned
plenty up now im going to use
it

  hush benson came through the
railing shrugging into his coat as
he went joan caught his sleeve
and smiled up at him wanly

  lets go hush well show these
cowards that there are at least two
on the staff who are not afraid to
do something

  her eyes held bills for an in-
stant the smile she gave him stung
like a slap in the face she glanced
at dell priest for another second
but the dark impassive face did not
change a muscle bill thought he
saw something deep and triumphant
crawl in the dark eyes then it was


street  smiths detective story magazine

gone and the eyes were veiled and
guarded again

  i think you are a pair of damned
fools williams said harshly i
dont like to see you go like this
bencon youve seen long service
here im willing to forget whats
been said and let you go back on the
job

  to joan he said you are being
very foolish miss digby the ex-
press was powerless to do anything
about your fathers death all we
could do was give you a chance we
did that youre pulling down a
good salary

  yes joan said thinly im pull-
ing down a good salary for what
ill tell you to help cover up the
crooks who were responsible for my
fathers murder

 yeah hush benson snarled
were a couple of damned fools
but remember this williams were
a couple of honest damned fools
he stared around the news room his
eyes full of contempt that was tragic
in its bitterness only two damned
fools on a big staff

 joan tugged at his arm come
on hush she said gently dont
let it get you well show these
worms what we can do

 hush stopped at the door and
looked back he lifted his head and
the contempt was like a flame as he
snapped yellowbellies then he
was gone clumping heavily through
the empty corridor to the street

  williams stared from dell priest

chapter ii

door to death

      ill dropped heavily in his
chair and leaned back his
brown eyes were no longer
sleepy and amused he was
thinking of a line of newspapermen
like old rush craig deadline
digby and hush benson men who
saw that the news was printed with-
out fear or favor men who swung
elections and kept something ap-
proaching honesty in public offices
he stared at the door that closed be-
hind clint williams and his wide
mouth twisted sardonically

  the twist grew more pronounced
as he saw dell priest get up from his
chair and cross the room to the pub-
lice telephone booth as he went
priest let his hard gaze run over the
news room bill dropped his eyes
and leaned farther back in his chair

  he knew now that he had sized
priest up right he was something
more-or less-than a reporter
right now he was spreading the
news of what had just happened
the departure of hush benson and
joan digby was the signal for some-
thing hell bill decided was ripe
to pop

  cold consuming rage brought him
to his feet something was urging
him to cross the news room to the
telephone booth and tear the dark-
faced reporter away from the line
but colder reason told him to wait
dell priest was playing a double
game the only way to uncover
that game was to play possum and
wait for a break

  he turned back to his typewriter
and the notes he had brought with
him from city hall and began to
crimson deadline



hammer out his story the lopsided
grin slowly coming back to his wide
mouth it was there when dell
priest came back from his desk the
dark man stared at him for a second
then dropped into his chair and
hunched over his machine

  sitting at the bar at the pelican
bill could feel the tension in the air
it was all over town the rats were
lying low planning their moves
the tension in the air was chill with
the threat of death bill remem-
bered the story of deadline digby
and shivered something like that
would happen to hush benson and
joan digby if they had half as much
information as they claimed they
possessed

 when bill swung down from the
bar stool he had one fixed idea in
his head he would look up hush
benson and see if he could help
if hell was to pop he might help
head off the guns that would be
looking for joan and old hush

  he left the cab on the corner of
myrtle and walked along the quiet
street until he came to the modest
bungalow where hush benson lived
he pulled off his battered hat as the
white-haired woman opened the
door her eyes were dark with
secret worry but she smiled at bill
and he felt a little stab in his breast
these were the kind of people who
always took the shock of trouble
the swell decent people of the
world

  mr benson she replied in an-
swer to bills question mr benson
went out an hour ago with joan
digby and mr priest

  bill hardly knew his own voice
did priest come here after him

 mrs benson nodded the fear
deepening in her eyes yes joan
was having supper with us when mr
priest came the three of them
went into the living room and talked

for a long time when they came
out ron kissed me and said he had
to go out for a while

  that was the first time that bill
knew bensons first name was ron
he knew no other than hush

  as she talked the shadow in mrs
bensons eyes deepened ron was
a little frightened but he was ex-
cited too mr priest must have told
him something that upset him

  bill nodded he could see it all
now priest had come to the house
to get hush and joan away without
any fuss he knew suddenly that
unless he acted hush benson and
joan would never come home again

 he murmured some futile words
to mrs benson and went down the
walk to the street feeling her gaze
on his back as he went it made him
cold and savage inside he wanted
to smash someone he wanted to
tear the truth out of someone like
priest

 he called the office and got
priests home address he caught a
cab and drove to the apartment
house on the east side it was a
walk-up affair priests apartment
was on the second floor

  all was quiet on the second floor
bills knuckles on the door made a
dull empty sound he knocked
twice the second time he knocked
harder and the door swung a little
it was not locked it wasnt even
caught on the latch he swung it
open and stepped inside holding his
breath expectantly

  priests living room was simply
furnished a few etchings on the
wall looked quiet and tasteful
there were two deep easy-chairs and
a wide deep davenport against one
wall a lighted bridge lamp made a
cone of yellow light beside one of
the big chairs the room somehow
didnt fit with the picture bill had
been building of the man behind


street  smiths detective story magazine

priests impenetrable mask

 across the room a door stood
open bill could see a bedpost and
a straight-backed chair dead si-
lence hung like a shroud over the
room a silence made heavy and
thick by mystery and something else
that made bill feel cold and taut

 he crossed the bedroom and
looked inside beyond the bedroom
he found the bath from the bath-
room he went back through the bed-
room into the living room a door
across the room beckoned him
something almost like hysteria
clutched bill as he put his hand on
the knob of the door some warn-
ing inner sense was trying to tell
him something he opened the
door then leaped backward six feet
to get away from the body that
seemed to be trying to fall into his
arms

  down on one knee he turned the
body over the man had been shot
through the heart he must never
have felt the death that struck so
suddenly he had a lean hard jaw
and a mouth that even in death was
purposeful

  someone behind him said well
what do you make of it

  bill whirled as he came to his feet
the man was just inside the living
room he smiled faintly and some
of the chiseled hardness left his face
he had gray eyes that weighed bill
and waited for him to speak he
looked very sure of himself as he
stood one hand in his coat pocket
big shouldered hard of jaw

  he held out his left hand palm
up and bill saw a small badge

  the big man said f b i he
nodded toward the man on the floor
he was my side kick we were
working to bust the rackets in this
town wide open priest was in on
it somewhere jake came up here
after him i guess they got him

his voice was devoid of tone or emo-
tion

  bills voice took on a ragged edge
priest picked up hush benson and
joan digby i figured hed brought
them here i came aiong and found
this he in turn jerked his head
at the dead man

 the big man nodded slowly
youre bill eagles the new man
on the express weve wondered
about you we noticed you got
around a lot and did a heap of lis-
tening we just couldnt figure
you there was an interrogative
inflection in his voice as if he would
like bill to explain himself

  bill ignored the question in the
voice and said priest killed your
pal he must have hustled joan and
hush away after that

  thats what he did the big man
agreed he had a couple of thugs
with him when they killed jake
i guess they got jittery and beat it
but we know where they went how
would you like to come with ms
while we pay them a little surprise
visit

  give me a gun and show me the
way bill said harshly

  the big fellow smiled thats
the spirit kid he smiled faintly
again when this is over youll
have the story you were looking for
it will blow the lid a mile high
to hell with the story now bill
rasped the first thing i want to
do is get joan and hush out of
priests hands then well see

 the big fellow handed bill an
automatic as he reached the door
and snapped

  lets go

  bill climbed silently into the
coupe beside the big fellow he
kept one hand in his pocket his fin-
gers curled around the butt of the
automatic he leaned forward his
eyes on the road his thoughts
crimson deadline



chaotic and jumbled

 the big man did not speak the
whole of the long trip that ended
before a darkened warehouse beside
the river he snapped off his lights
and said to bill

  this is it lets step inside
something cold rippled along
bills nerves there was something
phony about this set-up he jerked
the automatic out of his pocket just
as someone stepped swiftly out of
the shadows and yanked the door of
the coupe wide open the man
loomed huge in the semidarkness
bill saw the glint of light on gun
metal just as he squeezed the trigger
of the automatic

  the dead click of the gun echoed
in his brain the fellow was com-
ing around the back of the car a
gun in his hand chuckling as he
walked

stepped swiftly
out of tiie shadows

  the sap fell for it he took it
like a baby takes candy hell it
was too easy the mans voice had
a raspy edge to it the damn punk
would have shot me if the gun had
been loaded he stepped forward
the gun in his hand raised to slug
bill

  the big man caught his wrists and
snapped

  dont be a damned fool gaff
you knew the gat was empty i had
to give it to him to make him think
everything was on the up and up
gaff said something thickly as
bill got slowly out of the car he
jerked his wrists from the big fel-
lows grasp and struck bill in the


street  smiths detective story magazine

face with his free left hand

  thats a sample of whats com-
ing to you sap

  bill sucked his split lip and stood
silent while the man who had duped
him snatched the automatic out of
his hand he felt a little sick and
empty inside he had had such wild
dreams of coming to the rescue of
joan and instead he had walked like
a sheep into a blind alley the gang
now had him as well as joan and
hush

  i suppose he said bitterly
priest had it all figured out he
knew i would walk into his place
and so he sent you to pick me up
the big fellow chuckled yeah
he said priest had it all figured out
all right

  gaff snarled huskily you talk
too damn much dev some day the
boss will kick you in the pants with
a handful of slugs

  dev laughed again there are
other guys who will come first gaff
the boss knows i got brains he
can use brains you oughta try and
develop some

  gaff jabbed bill in the ribs with
a gun bill could feel the strength
of the rage behind the gun dev
was smart he enjoyed ribbing this
yegg just now he seemed highly
delighted with the smoothness of
the trick he had played on bill he
chuckled to himself as he walked in
front of bill through the echoing
emptiness of the warehouse to a
flight of stairs that led upward
through the darknes to a gleam of
light that marked a door

  the man who lounged in a chair
across the room was so thin that
he looked emaciated his cheek
bones seemed to be on the verge of
breaking through the parchment-
white skin his eyes were deep set
in his head and looked dull and dead

his voice was like his face dry and
lifeless

  you picked him up i see
sure dev said heartily it was
a cinch vale it was like leading
a lamb

  vale fixed his dead eyes on bill
and said in his lifeless voice
weve got most of the nosey ones
rounded up now he stared at
gaff the boss is going to be
pleased about this you know some-
times he hasnt been any too sure of
you hell like the way youve
handled this

  sure dev said with the same
heartiness he oughta be pleased
but its like i told you i know my
way around i dont know why the
hell you guys got to act so suspi-
cious all the time

  we get to live longer that way
vale said dryly we gotta make
sure of our men theres too many
of these damn feds trying to horn in
on the inside

  dev grinned and took the badge
from his pocket he held it in the
palm of his hand again i told you
about the fed i bumped his
badge came in awful damned handy
tonight

  vales dead eyes glowed for a sec-
ond youll flash that badge once
too often he said hoarsely take
my tip and youll toss the damned
thing into the river some day a
g-man might catch up with you and
find that thing in your pockets
then it would be just too bad

  dev laughed i never let any of
them get that close vale i can
smell those babies a mile away
to hell with this flapdoodle
vale snapped weve got to get
poing tie that punk up and well
go collect the rest of them in a
few hours when things quiet down
well take them all for a nice boat
ride
crimson deadline



  bill shivered he knew the others
would be joan and hush the man
who controlled crime in this town
didnt miss much not a move was
made that they didnt have spotted
it would be easy bill thought bit-
terly with men like priest on the
inside keeping track of all the
moves spotting the ones who might
be able to cause trouble

  only one thing cheered him the
g-men were in on this sooner or
later they would catch up with these
thugs the trouble was that it
might be too late to do him any
good too late to save joan and
hush

  as dev tied him very swiftly and
expertly bill ground out

  how do you expect to get away
with this you can bump off the
odd punk but you cant snatch
and kill two reporters and a city
editor and expect to get away with
it

  to hell we cant vale said
flatly itll make a nice mystery
for a while but youll go down as
missing no one will ever find you
where well put you dont worry
smart guy we figure our moves
safely

  gaff came around in front of bill
and hit him another smash in the
mouth

  this damn punk is too lippy
gaff snarled if i had my way id
bump him now and get it over with

  dev finished tying bill and faced
gaff smiling easily

  if you had your way brainless
wed all be waiting for our turns in
the hot seat right now dev added
softly you want to forget your
own ideas just because you have
them is proof that theyre lousy

  gaffs big shoulders hunched for-
ward and his tiny eys twinkled
with hate his thic lips pulled

away from his yellow teeth as he
snarled at dev

 vales voice snapped coldly
stop the fool arguments dev let
gaff alone hes dumb but he
does what hes told

  to gaff he said stick around
outside the door the punk cant
get loose but if he does and tries
to make a break plug him

chapter iii

against odds

ill listened to their feet
echoing hollowly in the
emptiness of the warehouse
as they went down the stairs
to the street gaff slapped bill once
more across the face with a full-
armed swing of his beefy hand that
made bill see pinwheels of fire for
a moment

  you would try to plug me would
you he snarled and went out

  bill heard the key turn in the lock
the flimsy wall shuddered as gaff
leaned his big shoulders against it
outside

 bill fought silently with his
bonds as he strained his heart
leaped the cords that held his
wrists were slipping there was
something queer about this set-up
he thought about it as he pulled his
wrists free of the binding cords and
went to work on his ankles there
was something screwy about the
whole series of events then he
pushed his perplexity from him as
he began to figure it out

 he crossed to the window and
found he could raise it he looked
down by letting himself drop from
the sill he could make it he could
get away easily enough then he
halted sucking his split lips again
he rubbed a palm across the lump
that gaff had made on his jaw and
his mouth hardened maybe gaff


street  smiths detective story magazine

would know where joan and hush
were being held

  he put the window down silently
he picked up the chair and swung
it smashing the window glass and
frame he dropped the chair and
leaped across the room to the door
he was pretty sure what the slow-
thinking short-tempered gaff would
do

  gaffs feet thundered in the hall
as he leaped to the door he turned
the key jerked the door open and
leaped through pausing to stare at
the smashed window across the
room

  bill put everything he had into
the swing that came up from the
floor all the red rage that had been
distilled when gaff struck him all
his savage wrath at the thought of
joan and hush went into the punch
he felt pain streak like fire along
his arm numbing it to the elbow as
his fist found the angle of gaffs
jaw

  bill stood looking down at gaff
who fell flat on his face his gun
banging on the floor in front of him
he massaged his right hand with the
fingers of his left wondering for a
brief moment if he had broken his
knuckles but life began to flow
back into the hand to assure him
that it was still serviceable

  he slipped gaffs gun into his
side pocket and began to truss the
big fellow by the time gaff
groaned the job was  completed
gaffs wrists were fastened to the
ankles that bill had pulled up be-
hind him

  bill squatted on his heels the gun
in his hand waiting for gaff to come
back to consciousness the gang-
sters little eyes blinked then his
thick lips twisted and his mouth
spouted profanity

  the smile had come back to bills
wide mouth but his brown eyes

were cold and deadly as he stopped
gaffs profanity with a left-hand
smash to the slobbering mouth

  he slipped a handkerchief from
his pocket rolled it into a ball and
jammed it into gaffs mouth he
tied it there with another he took
from the gangsters pocket thats
to keep you from yelling when your
pals come back with the rest of the
party

  he was remembering what vale
had said that he and dev were going
to pick up the others and bring them
here that meant joan and hush
and with them probably the punks
who were guarding them there
would be heavy odds against him
thinking of that bills grin wid-
ened as his hand tightened on the
butt of the big automatic the
element of surprise should work in
his favor

  he was at the bottom of the stairs
when he heard someone open the
outer door and walk softly across
the warehouse he stepped back
into the darkness and waited for the
man who moved so stealthily he
shifted the gun to his left and
stooped with his right balled into a
fist as the man approached walking
as softly as a stalking cat

  he could see the gleam of his
teeth as he lifted his head to peer
up the stairs he was halted wary
watchful listening as bill stepped
in his fist coming up in a ripping
uppercut the swing of the long
arm lifted the smaller man clear of
the floor and slammed him back
against the wall he bounced off
the wall and fell forward on his
face

  bill rolled him over and lighted
a match his breath hissed through
his teeth the man he had hit was
dell priest he was out but he
wouldnt stay unconscious long in
dell priest bill thought he had the
crimson deadline



key to the mystery priest knew
plenty he could be made to talk
it was someone high up in the crime
ring of plains city who had got him
his spot on the express to watch
and head off any moves

  he was debating what he should
do with priest when he heard the
purr of a motor coming into the
alley that led to the warehouse
that meant that dev and vale were
coming back with reinforcements
and bringing joan and hush with
them

  he edged the door open and slid
through to stand glued against the
angle made by the doorway head-
lights blazed a white path across the
wharf and vanished into the dark-
ness over the river then the light
was switched off and the car loomed
hugely in the light from the lamp at
the end of the alley

 he saw dev and two other men
he had not seen before climb out of
the car he heard vales voice flat
and dead yet with an undercurrent
of excitement say

  get those two out of the car and
hustle them inside you dev get
back at the wheel and take the car
to the garage then come back and
do your stuff

  dev said o k and swung be-
hind the wheel slamming the car
door heavily

 bill swore silently he had
picked dev first lined him for the
first slug the big easily smiling
man was he figured the most dan-
gerous one in the crowd

  bill waited till joan and hush
were out of the car with a man on
each side of them and vale moving
ahead of them toward the ware-
house before he called sharply
stand right there and stick
them up hush take their guns
joans head jerked up suddenly as
she stiffened into alertness her

voice was queer and strained as she
said bill bill eagles then it
rose in a quick scream cracked and
flattened as she yelped look out

  bill saw it first vale was diving
sideways pulling a gun from under
his arm it jerked around at a queer
angle and spouted orange flame bill
felt the wind of the slug fan his
cheek as he fired at the diving vale
he saw vales body jerk and knew
he had hit him

  the other two men were trying to
get behind the car one of them
made it the other went backward
as though a hand had pushed him
his arms waving as though he fought
to get his balance the man behind
the car was slinging lead

  bill found his voice jump
joan jump you darned little
fool

  she ran for the front of the car
around it to the other side with
hush at her heels

  bill was yelling again as he fired
the gun joan was going to run
around the car the fellow on that
side would get her and there was
dev back of the wheel he was
cranking the window down so he
might be able to shoot

  the whole action had taken place
in swift seconds the gunshots al-
most blended one with another bill
crouched tensely he had to get
that man behind the car he had
to get him to save joan hed have
to get him if it meant charging into
his gunfire

  someone behind him made up his
mind for him a shoulder hit him
in the middle of the back and he shot
forward sprawling on his face on
the wharf as he fell he glimpsed
priest diving for the car the
door slammed and his voice rose
sharp and hoarse to dev

  get this crate wheeling its the
break


street  smiths detective story magazine

  the car leaped forward with a
roar of the motor it almost over-
turned as dev wheeled it around
the man behind the car was going
over backward bill pushed himself
up with his elbow and shot the gang-
ster before he regained his balance

  the big sedan came to a full stop
before it left the wharf priest was
leaning out of a rear window a gun
in his hand joan and hush were
the only ones standing frozen mo-
mentarily in something like stunned
surprise bill wanted to scream a
warning and knew that wouldnt
help he lined the gun on the sedan
window and pulled the trigger all
he got was a dead click he had
emptied the gun he dropped it and
leaped for vales weapon it was
lying there glinting in the dim light
where vale had dropped it bill got
splinters in his hand from the wharf
planks as he landed but he had the
gun he aimed at the sedan and
blasted lead at the rear window he
could see the slug star the glass
but the sedan was gone with a roar
of motor

  for a frozen second bill glanced
around vale was lying on his fice
his body twisted the man vho had
fallen over backward was flat on his
back his arms flung outward the
third man was also on his back with
arms clutched around his middle
rolling from side to side and moan-
ing in time with his rolling

  somewhere beyond sirens moaned
and screamed bill didnt know his
own voice as he snapped

  come on lets get out of this

  they caught a cab and put the
wail of the sirens behind them while
hush talked

  i dont know what the hell its
all about he said priest came to
us tonight and talked from what
he said he knew more than we did
about what was going on he told

us that our number was up that
word had gone out about us and that
we were marked for death

  the dirty son bill said harshly
he sent out the word hes no re-
porter he was placed there in the
news room he was telephoning
someone before you got through
quitting

  joan said nothing just shivered
she had caught bills hand and
hung onto it with trembling des-
peration

  hush went on shaking his head
as he talked i dont know bill
theres something sour about the
whole mess i cant tell who is
which and why then speculation
gleamed in his shrewd eyes but
how come you stepped into the pic-
ture i thought you were the boy
who knew how to keep his nose
clean

  ill tell you about it bill an-
swered but it will be later first
you tell me what happened priest
came after you what then
priest hush said priest has
got me stumped i cant figure him
at all then his voice lost its won-
dering note and went on he came
to the house as i said he claimed
to know plenty if we would come
with him he told us hed help us
break the thing right

  it sounded reasonable so we
went along he took us to his apart-
ment and left us there told us to
wait till he got back theres some-
thing about that guy something
that i cant figure something that
puzzles me

  the rat bill commented the
dirty sneaking rat

  hush shook his head i dont
know bill he resumed his story
again he left joan and me there
and told us to wait till he got back
we waited we were waiting when
the three men came in two of
crimson deadline



them had guns the third man un-
locked the door for them and came
in ahead inside he tried to make a
break and one of the thugs shot him
and stuffed him in the closet
joan shivered violently and bills
clasp on her hand tightened it
seemed to steady her

 hush went on they hustled
the two of us out into a car and
drove to an apartment uptown
the two men seemed to be waiting
for some word finally vale and
the man called dev arrived and
brought us here

  bill told them briefly how he had
walked in on it the thought of
the trick dev had pulled on him still
made him sore when he thought of
it the thought of priest made him
still sorer

  priest is tangled up with the mess
in some way hush said slowly
sure as hell he is but the guy
has got me puzzled i cant figure
him out

  ill figure him out if i catch up
to the rat bill said bitterly ill
take him apart hell squeal when
i put the pressure on and ill put
it on plenty his voice was thick
and heavy with passion

 then he turned his mind away
from priest and dev to the two in
the cab with him how much dope
have you got on the gang behind all
this he asked

 hush jerked his head at joan
shes got some real stuff i know
plenty between us we can cause a
hell of a lot of trouble for these rats
if he added bitterly we can get
any backing

  joan said sharply i know about
the crossetti killing i can link it
directly to chief anderson cros-
setti was killed by a cop he was
killed because he knew too much
and was beginning to get greedy
he had a swelled head so ander-

son acting on orders from somebody
higher up passed the word and
crosetti got it

  thats not much bill said
morosely we want more than that
to tack the crimes where they be-
long

  vale worked for the d as of-
fice hush said grimly i can prove
that and we can damn well prove
the snatching tonight some of the
boys on the paper know plenty if
i could sit at the city desk with full
authority i could turn out a couple
of stories tonight that would rock
this town to its foundations and
bring in state and federal heat
thats where were headed now
bill snapped ive got ideas i
think youll find a little surprise
waiting for you

  hush leaned forward in his seat
just who the hell are you youve
had me puzzled ever since you
walked in and asked for a job i
knew you werent the type of guy
to write the drivel you handed in
unless you had a damned good rea-
son for keeping your mouth closed
i figured you for a joker of some
kind

  i guess maybe i am bill said
softly but let it ride for the pres-
ent well see whats waiting for us
at the news room

  hush shrugged joan kept her
blue eyes on bill and they were
speculative hush broke the silence

  another thing has my goat the
fellows who were holding us in the
apartment had a visitor whoever
it was he stayed in the next room
and talked to the fellows who were
holding us there that means he
didnt want either of us to see him
i couldnt hear what he said to them
i could just hear the rumble of his
voice but it was damned familiar
it was a voice ive heard often
hush stared at bill his voice


street  smiths detective story magazine

mirroring the mystery with which
he wrestled then as the cab pulled
to the curb in front of the express
office he shook his head and sighed
i suppose ill find out sooner or
later

  well find out a lot of things
sooner or later bill said grimly
if we can get some action we may
make it sooner

chapter iv
preview

he old easy smile was on his
face when he walked into
the news room with joan
and hush the whole staff
halted work and stared an electric
tension seemed to run through the
room

  compton got up from the city
desk and came across the room he
had a telegraph blank in his hand
he shoved it in front of bill his
hand shook a little and his eyes were
full of puzzled fear

  what does this mean eagles
he asked

  bill read the telegram

 william eagles taking over
managing editorship express
to take effect immediately

cronin

  bill smiled cronin was the boss
at the top of the craig chain of
papers answerable only to the trus-
tees of the craig estate

 the smile got lopsided and
crooked as he said i guess it ex-
plains itself he handed the tele-
gram to hush and said do you
suppose you could get out the paper
youd like to print tonight if you
went back to the desk

  hush read the telegram over and
over the import of the message
seemed a long time in penetrating
joan digby stared over hushs

shoulder and red spots began to
glow in her cheeks the blue of her
eyes was very deep

  she was the first to speak bill

you fooled us but now- she

broke off to stare

 hush drew a long heavy breath
and got around to answering bills
question could he said in a
choked voice then his voice
mounted and grew stronger
could i holy cow could i
bill stared at compton who had
not moved since he had handed over
the telegram bills voice crackled
as he asked williams knows of
course

compton nodded bill turned
away with the nod saying to hush
wed better go see williams
with his hand on the knob of the
door the door pushed open a scant
inch bill froze

  williams was talking to someone
over the phone his voice was
harsh with desperation i tell you
this is the smash if you fellows dont
stop fumbling you had eagles and
the other two and you let them go
if youd hung onto them we could
still pull this mess out of the fire
bill pushed the door wide and
said his eyes as steady as the gun
in his hand

  but they didnt williams they
didnt hold us

  clint williams dropped the tele-
phone into its cradle as though it
burned his fingers his eyes were
wide and scared then they nar-
rowed as one hand dropped behind
the desk

  i wouldnt try that williams
bill said harshly put your hands
on the top of the desk-both of
them and sit tight

 hushs voice sounded as if he
could not himself believe what he
was saying it was williamss
voice i heard talking to vale i

should have known i should have
known

  i should have known too joan
said in a stiff unnatural voice i
should have known that father was
sold out from inside i should have
known that and guessed

  williamss hands were steady as
they rested on the desk after the
first shock of surprise he seemed
to have gained control of himself
his voice was as steady as he re-
marked you should have guessed
youre still guessing youll find it
difficult to prove anything

 not when we start cracking
down hush rasped when we
start putting the pressure on the
rats who were in this with you
theyll talk fast enough theyll
squeal to save their own skins

  bill put his head on one side and
gazed at williams speculatively
you were at the top he said
slowly that means you had plenty
on the others you had to have in
order to keep them in line a smart
guy like you would have documen-
tary proof that you could hold over
their heads

  the old lopsided smile was wider
than ever as he saw williams glance
at the safe the safe that was stand-
ing ajar as if williams had lately
been going through some of its con-
tents he saw also the spasm of
emotion that drew williamss face
into taut lines for a second he
froze half expecting that williams
was going to make a dive for it
then the emotion passed and the
editors face became cold and im-
passive but now the knowledge of
what he faced was in his eyes

 bill crossed the room in two
strides his left hand struck wil-
liams in the chest and the chair shot
backward on its rollers leaning
across him bill lifted the gun he
saw in the open drawer

 ds-

  without taking his eyes off wil-
liams he said look in the safe
hush and see whats there you
should get some stuff for swell front
page stories

  the papers hush pulled out made
loud rustlings in the silence of the
office out of the corners of his
eyes bill saw joan leaning over
hushs shoulder her breath was
coming in quick gasps hush said
nothing just stared at the papers in
his hands for a long moment then
whistled a long lingering note

  his big hands shook as he con-
tinued to paw through the papers
when he straightened he stared at
bill with stark unbelief in his eyes

  theres enough here to keep the
electric chair busy for a week he
said with this i can blast the
whole gang of crooked politicians
and crooks loose with one issue of
the express

  then hop to it bill snapped
never mind deadlines get the
boys started get an extra out as
fast as the works will take it ill
be here with williams when the
presses start

  hushs voice was strained and full
of awe he stared from bill to the
papers in his shaking hands that
i should live to see this day then
he leaped for the door with his voice
rising to a roar come on you lead-
footed sons and show me you can
turn out a paper

  bill grinned at joan hop to it
sister he said this is your break
you can write the story of your
father and put the responsibility for
his death where it belongs lets
see how good you are

  she halted a moment in the door
and stared at bill her eyes widen-
ing she smiled faintly then said
mister ill show you

  bill could hear hushs voice bel-
lowing in the news room hey am-


street  smiths detective story magazine

bers heres the stuff on the d a
work in the dope you already know
the proof im giving you lets you
cut loose with all your guns

  he sounded like the hush benson
that bill had heard about bellow-
ing black heres the dope on an-
derson you cully blow the dust
off your typewriter and bang out
this county story

  there was nothing hush-hush in
the voice that said to joan digby
kid im giving you your big
chance make it personal and hard
hitting smear the story of old
deadline give the crooks the
works for the snatch tonight you
know where the stuff belongs lay
it on their doorsteps kid

  watching williams who did not
move a muscle who leaned back
against the wall in his swivel chair
with the life and fire flowing out of
his eyes minute by minute bill felt
worry gnawing at his vitals the
gang behind the mess wouldnt take
this lying down there were tough
men out there beyond the walls of
the express office they might
make a desperate sally and try to
get back some of the stuff that was
now in the news room

 something of the same idea
writhed in williamss eyes he was
beaten but watching him bill
knew that the man was tough he
wouldnt hesitate at anything if he
could salvage something out of the
wreckage

  it was much later that hush ben-
son stuck his head in the office

  bill he said its on the way
i did anothet  thing on my own i
called up captain hicks hes a
square cop i told him to dig up all
the guys he could trust and fan them
out around the building if the
thugs that front for this racket want
action theyll get plenty of it
relief flowed in bills eyes as hope

flowed out of the man opposite him
he threw hush a quick grin

  swell hush keep the stuff roll-
ing he said

 the thought of priest still
prodded him there was a deeper
mystery behind him than had yet
been probed something told bill
that the stone-faced reporter was
tougher than anyone he had met yet

  through the closed door bill
could feel the tension that suddenly
gripped the outer room silence
dropped suddenly the machine
gun clatter of typewriters was
abruptly stilled then a murmur
ran through the outer room almost
drowning the voice that spoke with
quick authority

  bill backed to the door not tak-
ing his eyes off williams he saw
hope flare briefly in the editors eyes
then the door opened before he
turned his head bill knew it was all
right he saw the stunned sick
look in williamss face

  he half turned his head and saw
chief anderson coming through the
door the face of the fat police
chief was gray and sagging his
eyes were like the eyes of a dead
fish behind him the district attor-
ney tried to hold himself together
but his pale jowls were trembling
and his mouth was working con-
vulsively

  before the next man came into
his line of vision bill stiffened
the man spoke and the sound of his
voice was like a jolt to the stomach
as he said

  just a couple more of the boys
to join the party

  bill jerked around and saw dell
priest the dark face was no longer
impassive the tight mouth was
dropped in a sardonic smile his
right hand gripped a gun his left
touched the lump on his jaw as he
stared at bill and said
crimson deadline



  you certainly put authority into
your swings bill eagles

  behind priest was a tall man who
leaned negligently against the side
of the door and smiled easily bills
eyes narrowed none of this made
sense the fellow in the doorway
was dev the man who had snatched
him earlier in the evening

 dev said sorry buddy but
neither priest nor myself dared spill
anything to you we had to be
damned sure working on the inside
the way we were

  priest said when i took hush
and joan to my apartment i left one
of the boys outside to guard the
joint i know now how they took
him when dev got word to pick
you up he figured it would be just
as well but he figured you wrong
he thought when you found your-
self loose you would jump through
the window and make your get-
away instead of that you back-
tracked and nearly gummed the
works

  then you are g-men bill said
hollowly he remembered trying to
plug dev first he wondered if the
big fellow knew how close he had
come to getting a slug

  yeah said dev easily were
that kind of boys a bunch of us
have been in it here for some time
trying to untangle the mess he
stared at williams briefly it took
us a long time to catch up to the
head boy and now that we have
we find you already here swell
work kid

  bill felt the floor beneath his feet
begin to tremble that would be the
presses starting he glanced at the
clock on williamss desk

  priest glanced at it also then
turned to bill youre kinda push-
ing the deadline ahead tonight
arent you

  this said bill softly isnt the

real deadline this is a sort of pre-
view headline were going to pre-
view it right here i hope the boys
like it he swept the three faces
with a sardonic glance

  like it asked priest ironically
hell man theyll love it

 a boy rushed through the door
and threw a stack of damp papers
on the desk he smiled at bill
round eyed let his gaze travel
around the room then backed slowly
out saying in a scared voice gee
bill silently passed the papers
around the room glaring headlines
told the story of the death of the
crime ring in plains city

  hush benson and joan came into
the room to stand beside bill
quietly bill was watching wil-
liams the former managing edi-
tors face did not change as he read
the headlines then slowly he lifted
the paper till it screened his face

  bill sprang with priests yelp of
warning he moved fast so fast he
reached williams ahead of dev who
leaped like a panther

  williams himself jerked the paper
down from before his face his lips
contorted in a grimace of agony

  too late boys he said harshly
ive pushed my own deadline
ahead i guess plains city has got
a paper at last that means im due
to step out

 he pitched forward out of the
chair writhing by the time bill
had him turned over he was dead

  he was a nervy guy priest said
softly he must have known that
the day was coming sooner or later
and made himself ready for it i
guess he was a good enough news-
paperman to know that sooner or
later there would be a paper in
plains city

  he turned and stared at anderson
and the district attorney you boys
wont get a chance to pull anything


street  smiths detective story magazine

like that youll go to trial along
with a raft of crooks just like your-
selves its just as williams said
plains city has a paper its a sort
of symbol isnt it now well just
have you boys put away where you
can be quiet and think it over

  the procession had long since left
the news room when bill stood at
the city desk with hush benson
and joan digby beside him facing
the silent staff from the streets
came the hoarse roar of the crowds
crowds that read the express extra
and gave vent to their anger

  bill glanced at hush and smiled
he looked at joan and something
else came into his smile as he met
the gleam of her blue eyes then
he lifted his head and stared at the
staff and the smile faded

  im sorry i had to come in as i

did boys he said slowly you
know now that im not bill eagles
but bill craig for the past year
ive been making the rounds study-
ing the business firsthand doing my
stuff on a beat trying to learn
something about how to run a news-
paper plains city taught me how
necessary a good paper is

  he paused then went on with
your help i hope to run a real sheet
here thats all

  its one hell of a lot hush said
later as he watched joan and bill
walk slowly out of the news room
then he straightened his stooped
shoulders and his hard eyes gleamed
as he reached for his coat the
preview is over he bellowed to-
morrow you guys come in here ready
to shoot the rest of the stuff weve
got a newspaper now

author of desperate dues etc

is soul sick with dread eric
ashley tried desperately to
find a way of escape from the
situation into which he had
trapped himself he had taken eight
hundred dollars of the banks
money and he knew the shortage
couldnt be covered up any longer
his folly had caught up with him

  behind the steel grille of the
second tellers window he pretended
to be busy inside his cage but that
was only to conceal his panic as
his mind blundered around in the
same hopeless circle it always
brought him back to the same place

-flight was his only chance to es-
cape arrest

  yes ive got to get away and get
away fast he said under his breath
the bank examiners will be here
tomorrow

 he looked down at his cash
drawer the bills there were mostly
of small denominations and the
amount wasnt so large as it ap-
peared to be

  i can pinch out another thousand
for get-away money he thought
thatll get me to florida with
something to spare the horses will
be running down there if i can hit


street  smiths detective story magazine

a few long shots and send back the
money maybe thatll square things
a shadow moved between him and
the street window of the bank eric
ashleys head jerked up and he
forced a smile to his lips the
queen city national had a slogan
the bank with a smile

  good afternoon mrs kinsella
he said

  mrs martha kinsella short and
stocky good-natured and rich-rich
that is for a town the size of queen
city-was beaming jovially as she
thrust a check under the wicket

  ill have cash for this she said
ten hundred-dollar bills and the
rest in tens and twenties if you
please eric

  eric ashley picked up the check
and looked at it the amount was
fifteen hundred dollars

  looks like youre starting on
your annual trip south he said

  a west indies cruise this year
she told him im taking the seven
oclock train to new york tomorrow
morning the boat sails monday
ill send you some post cards eric
swell exclaimed young ash-
ley with mechanical enthusiasm and
reached for the cash drawer how
long will you be away

  six weeks eric the cruise
takes only two but im going to stop
over in new york on my way back
im fifty-five years old and have
never seen the inside of a night club
night-clubbing at my age keep it
a dark secret eric

  ashley counted the money twice
before he slid it across the marble
slab and mrs kinsella herself
counted it three times for all her
jollity she was always careful about
such things not stingy just care-
ful

  right she exclaimed briskly

and put the bills into her handbag
well so long eric ill not forget
the post cards

  ashley watched her as she moved
away from the window an idea
shot into his mind he looked again
at the check

 shes going to be away six
weeks he thought nobody to
watch her account while shes gone
if i could raise this check to twenty-

five hundred-

  but he knew the idea was no good
the new girl who posted the paid
checks on the banks ledgers came
close to being a handwriting expert
twice in a month she had ques-
tioned signatures that had got past
the tellers and only day before yes-
terday she had spotted a raised
check

  ashley didnt dare risk it flight
was his only possible escape at least
it seemed to be until still another
idea leaped into his harassed brain
desperate men think of desperate
things and he was thinking now
that mrs martha kinsella wasnt
leaving town until the seven oclock
train tomorrow morning tonight
she would be practically alone in
her big rambling house out on
maple avenue-alone with that
fifteen hundred dollars in cash

  eric ashley caught his breath
sharply his nerves strained taut
vibrating like strands of tightly
drawn wire

  yes he whispered thats my
solution the money to cover my
shortage and seven hundred over
nobody could possibly suspect a fel-
low whos got a job in a bank turn-
ing housebreaker this is my out
the more he turned it over in his
mind the simpler and safer the plan
seemed to be he decided to go
through with it

  eric ashley lived in lovelocks
the blue-black feet



boardinghouse out on taft street
on his way home from the bank a
little after five oclock he caught
up with helen hamlin the pretty
new school-teacher who taught first-
year latin in queen city high she
was with harry dreen and they too
roomed with the lovelocks

  despite his preoccupation with
the details of his desperate scheme
of burglary eric felt a hot flush of
resentment hed been getting along
swell with helen hamlin until this
harry dreen had pushed himself
into the picture

  what the hell did she see in the
fellow anyhow harry dreen was
a nobody a kid of twenty-two or
twenty-three who had drifted into
queen city little better than a bum
a tramp printer who ran a linotype
machine for the evening standard

  nobody would call him handsome
his features were too rugged for
that he wore cheap clothes didnt
have a car and never seemed to
have any money to spend ashley
couldnt understand why this gor-
geous girl with the streamlined legs
auburn hair beautiful eyes and the
most kissable mouth he had ever
seen should prefer the company of
a common printer to that of a man
who worked in a bank wore tailored
suits and was willing to buy theater
tickets

  for weeks eric ashley had de-
tested harry dreen with a growing
hatred which he was finding it diffi-
cult to conceal every time he sat
down at the boardinghouse table
with him or passed him on the
stairs he had an almost uncontrolla-
ble impulse to smash dreens face

  ashley steered his car over to the
curb and braked to a stop he con-
sidered himself a very natty figure
in his harris tweed topcoat pigskin
gloves and rakish hat harry
dreens overcoat was one of those

nondescript garments that are
bought in bargain basements for
fifteen dollars the sleeves looked
too short for his long arms

  hello there sang out eric
ashley how about giving you a
lift home helen he was making
it obvious that the invitation did not
include harry dreen

 helen hamlin darted a quick
glance up into harry dreens face
the latter was smiling in tolerant
amusement

  why sure helen he said go
right ahead if you like

  some people are so damn dumb
they dont know when theyre being
insulted thought eric and gave
young dreen a long hard stare of
withering contempt

  helen hamlins face flushed her
voice was crisply cool as she an-
swered thanks mr ashley but
we prefer to walk there was the
barest emphasis on the pronoun

  in a quick flare of temper eric
ashley slammed in the gears and re-
leased the clutch with a violence
that wouldnt do a car any good

  so help me he muttered as the
roadster lurched forward im
going to find a way to do something
to that guy he burns me up

  at dinner that night ashley made
it a point to laugh heartily at old
man matsons bum jokes just to
impress the others at the table that
he didnt have a worry or a serious
thought on his mind after dinner
some one suggested bridge and he
played for a couple-of hours con-
tinuing his role of being the life
of the party

  a little after ten he went up to
his room and locked the door from
the inside in his trunk he dug
around for an old suit which he no
longer used for anything except to
wear on an occasional fishing trip
it was pretty worn and shabby


street  smiths detective story magazine

which exactly suited his purpose

  for the next thirty or forty min-
utes he experimented with a disguise
and studied the effect in the mirror
with an old tweed cap and an im-
provised mask fastened across his
face he found it impossible to be-
lieve that anyone could possibly
recognize him as the natty dapper
bank teller who worked for the
queen city national

  only one danger ashley told
himself theres a bare chance i
might be recognized on the street

  this possibility however did not
greatly disturb him for his mirror
told him that when he pulled up the
high collar of the worn gray sports
sweater and yanked the deep visor
of the cap over his eyes his features
would be practically unrecognizable
in the night gloom of queen citys
none-too-wll-lighted streets

  for another half hour he practiced
a trick of hunching his shoulders
and disguising his voice he really
began to take a vain delight in his
masquerade feeling himself a qute
extraordinary fellow

  clever he exclaimed softly
damned clever if i do say so my-
self

  then he held out his hands and
looked at them amazed to discover
his nerves so steady he gave a
stare of appreciation at himself in
the glass grinning

  ive got to hand it to you mr
ashley youve got more of that
thing they call intestinal fortitude
than i thought you had

  ashley killed more time until the
clock on his bureau marked fifteen
minutes past one the time was
still a little earlier than he had
originally planned but he had now
such a feeling of boldness and safety
he decided to risk it

  after all he muttered this

burg is a nine oclock town hell
they even lock up the bars before
midnight

  he switched out the lights within
his room and carrying his shoes in
his hand to put them on just before
slipping out of the house started
creeping cautiously down the stairs
the lovelock boarding house was
wrapped in slumber the stair
treads creaked faintly and the eeri-
ness of the sound did something to
his nerves his hands wouldnt
have been so steady if he had
looked at them now

  reaching the bottom landing he
sat down on the last step put on
his shoes and slipped his hands into
a pair of gloves then he opened
the vestibule door onto the front
porch and it was all he could do to
check the outcry of dismay that
sprang to his lips

  the whole plan was knocked into
a cocked hat spoiled finished it
didnt have a chance

  upstairs in his room with the
window shades drawn to the bottom
of the sashes he hadnt known that
snow had fallen snow seldom fell
in queen city so early in novem-
ber and it gave him a suddenly terri-
fied feeling that the very forces of
nature were in league against him

  the snow had stopped now but a
white carpet covered the ground to
a depth of a full inch-a wet cling-
ing mass of the stuff that would take
and hold a mans footprint like a
matrix the very emptiness of the
residential streets-the thing he had
counted on for safety-made it cer-
tain that his own tracks would stand
out in a clear trail for the police to
follow straight from the boarding-
house to mrs kinsellas and back to
the lovelock boardinghouse again

  his shoes would fit those tracks
and he would be hopelessly trapped
the blue-black feet	

the scheme was all washed up

  overwhelmed by this ironic
calamity which had ruined his one
and only chance of avoiding the des-
perate necessity for flight he crept
numbly back up the stairs it was
even too late to take another
thousand dollars from the bank a
hopeless sense of futility crushed
him down escape how could
there possibly be any escape when
even the elements had joined in a
conspiracy against him

  harry dreens room adjoined his
own as eric ashley moved along
the second floor hall he heard the
sound of the printers heavy breath-
ing on the other side of the door
it was more distinct because the
door was not completely closed
only yesterday dreen had been com-
plaining that the lock would not
catch

  in his own despair ashley felt a
fresh rage against harry dreen he
moved on toward his own room
when something clicked in his mind
the complete unexpectedness of his
inspiration jarred him to an abrupt
stop literally with one foot lifted
in mid-air

  that inch of snow on the ground
-it wasnt a conspiracy against
him after all it was made to order
for him a trail of footprints lead-
ing straight to mrs kinsellas house
and straight back again-but they
would not be his own they would
be harry dreens

  eric ashley held his breath for an
instant

  perfect he whispered dreens
a stranger in this town he came
here down and out little better than
a bum hes hard up as hell-his
clothes show that nobody will be-
lieve he didnt take the money-
especially if the police find some of
it on him

  the bank teller tiptoed back to
the door of harry dreens room lis-
tened he pushed the panel open a
few inches enough illumination
filtered in from the dimly lighted
hall to reveal the linotype operator
lying on his right side his face to
the wall

  it was the cheapest and smallest
room in the house and lacked closet
space that perhaps was why
harry dreen had hung his clothes
neatly across a chair when he had
turned in his shoes were on the
floor beside the chair-worn shoes
that told a story of more than one
trip to the cobblers for repairs

  eric ashley eased himself within
the room if dreen awakened he
would say he had heard groans and
thought he ought to find out what
was wrong

  but harry dreen did not waken
swiftly ashley scooped up the
clothes including a fresh pair of
socks retreated into the hall and
into his own room hurriedly he
got into dreens things all but the
shoes again in his stockinged feet
-they were dreens socks this time
for they must be damp when the po-
lice found them-he went a second
time down the stairs jerked on the
shoes and let himself out of the
house

  the carpet of snow muffled his
footsteps along the narrow driveway
as he made his way to the lovelock
garage the garage door made a
little noise when he let himself in-
side he easily found what he
wanted the broken section of an
old automobile spring which love-
lock used as a tire iron to change the
tires of his ancient car ashley
could think of nothing better with
which to pry open a stubborn win-
dow

  with the tire iron hugged under
his coat he made his way back to


street  smiths detective story magazine

the street and walked very fast over
to maple avenue he kept looking
behind laughing a little hysterically
under his breath to see what a fine
trail of footprints harry dreens
patched old shoes made in the snow

  this will take care of you mr
dreen he thought itll take care
of you for the next five years

  mrs martha kinsellas house
stood at the corner of maple and
high a big roomy place built in
the days of large families and visit-
ing relatives it was forty or fifty
feet back from the street

  eric ashley squeezed himself
through the hedge pausing long
enough to let one of the hedge
thorns snag dreens coat and snare
a fragment of the cloth

  youll never get out of this mr
dreen he exulted

  eric ashley had been at the kin-
sella house many times in his
childhood he had played with the
kinsella boys they had all mar-
ried and moved away now

  he slipped around to the back of
the house his feet had begun to
feel cold from the moisture of the
melting snow which leaked in
through harry dreens shoes

 the kitchen window easily
reached from the back stoop was the
one eric ashley picked using the
tire iron as a jimmy he forced up
the sash and the snapping of the
lock made much less noise than he
had expected he began to have a
very good opinion of himself as a
burglar

  the kinsella house being familiar
the housebreaking bank teller had
no difficulty in finding his way the
furniture seemed to be in exactly
the same place as it had always been

  at the bottom of the stairs he
paused tied his homemade mask
across his face then moved stealth-
ily on up the carpeted steps the tire

iron gripped in his right hand it
made a formidable weapon a heavy
blow with a piece of steel like this
could split open a skull

  ashley knew too where mrs kin-
sellas bedroom would be the door
was wide open and so was one of
the windows mrs kinsella be-
lieved in getting plenty of fresh air

  for just an instant eric ashleys
desperate courage threatened to de-
sert him his mouth felt suddenly
dry and his knees weak and wabbly

  suppose his disguise wasnt so
good as he thought and mrs kin-
sella did recognize him then con-
ceit in his own cleverness and the
realization that he must either go
through with the burglary or take
the consequences pulled him out of
his funk

 he went on within the room
gently closed the door and snapped
on a light-the farthest one from
the bed to keep himself in the shad-
ows as much as possible

  mrs kinsella stirred muttered in
her sleep eric ashley hunched his
shoulders moved toward the bed
and prodded the woman with the
end of the tire iron he attempted
his best possible imitation of a thug
as he growled

  snap out of it lady you and me
has got some business together

  mrs kinsellas eyes opened re-
mained glazed with sleep for an in-
stant and then bulged wide with
astonishment and alarm her mouth
filled to let out a scream

  keep your trap shut and no-
body gets hurt rasped eric ashley
but one yelp outta you see and i
bash your head in-with this he
made a threatening gesture with the
tire iron

  mrs kinsella did not scream

  wheres the dough lady-that
big wad of kale i seen you takin
outta the bank this afternoon
the blue-black feet



come on now where you got it
i-i dont know what you mean

whispered mrs kinsella i-

  cut out the stalling snarled
ashley wheres that fifteen hun-
dred bucks or have i gotta give
you a good smack with this little
persuader

  most of the fear vanished from
mrs kinsellas eyes lost in a be-
wildered expression then her ter-
ror was gone entirely

 eric ashley she gasped in-
credulously what on earth does
this mean why are you pretend-
ing to be a burglar or maybe-
maybe youre not pretending still

i cant believe-

 ashley thought she had recog-
nized his voice he didnt know that
his mistake had been to mention the
amount of money mrs kinsella had
drawn from the bank and that her
wits had been quick enough to re-
member that only she and eric ash-
ley had seen the amount of the check
she had cashed

  all eric ashley knew was that he
was trapped and that now only one
thing could save him-the eternal
silence of this woman who knew
who he was and why he was here
perhaps if hed had a little more
time to think his hand would have
stayed but panic was hard upon him
and his hand gripping the tire iron
lifted

  mrs kinsella saw the expression
in his eyes she knew what it meant
her shrill scream stabbed out wildly
through the nights stillness
wait eric wait

  but eric ashley had got in too
deep to wait the two-foot length
of tempered steel crashed down and
struck what had been a case of
embezzlement was now a matter of
murder

  it wasnt pleasant to look at ash-
ley reeled back sick and faint grop-

ing for the door he was halfway
out into the hall before he remem-
bered that he hadnt got what he had
come for-the fifteen hundred dol-
lars

  he forced himself back into the
room began to search mrs kin-
sellas handbag was in the second
drawer of the dresser in plain sight
jerking open the clasp he groped
in his hand found the money
stuffed it into the outside pocket of
harry dreens coat

  racing down the stairs an instant
later he heard mrs kinsellas maid
who slept on the third floor running
for the stairs he got out of the
house before she had a chance to see
him

  pursuit he knew would not be
far behind his trail of footprints
would lead the police straight to
lovelocks boardinghouse

 on his way back ashley cut
across a vacant lot to save time
tumbling into a shallow gully that
had about a foot of water in it and
got soaking wet halfway to his
knees

 that was all right they were
harry dreens clothes and the more
evidence against harry dreen so
much safer it would be for himself

  eric ashley reached the boarding-
house let himself in with his key
and was taking off the wet shoes
when he realized he had the money
on him-evidence that would doom
him to the electric chair if it was
found in his possession

  where can i hide it he whis-
pered thickly not anywhere out
of doors the footprints in the snow
will lead the police to any place i
go its got to be cached somewhere
inside the house

  for an instant in his terror he
thought it might be the safest thing
to leave all the money in harry
dreens room-and take the conse-


street  smiths detective story magazine

quences for his shortage at the bank

  but he didnt dare to do that
either discovery of his embezzle-
ment mrs kinsellas check the
proof he knew she had the money
would put him under instant suspi-
cion

  eric ashley stood for a frantic
moment not knowing what to do
then because he had to do some-
thing he crept into the dark living
room to his left groped his way
toward the old-fashioned bay win-
dow where mrs lovelock kept some
potted plants the breath pumping
in and out of his lungs in hissing
jets of sound he clawed a hole with
his gloved fingers into the dirt of
a wooden bucket of ferns put the
money there and patted the dirt
back in place

  he would have preferred a more
ingenious concealment but in his
extremity with the minutes rushing
past and time so important and his
mind in a frightened daze it was
the best he could do

  the house still slept soundly as
he went up the stairs in his room
without turning on a light he
stripped off harry dreens clothes
with shaking fingers that fumbled
with every button put on his pa-
jamas then crept back into the hall

  harry dreen seemed not to have
moved although he wasnt breathing
so heavily now ashley put the
clothes back on the chair one of
the shoes slipped out of his hand
and struck the floor with a loud
thump the bed springs creaked a
little as harry dreen moved his
sleep disturbed by the sound

  but to eric ashleys relief the
linotype operator did not awaken
and eric tiptoed in his bare feet out
into the hall and back into his own
room where he crawled into bed
still without having turned on a
light for a few moments he lay

there trembling and shivering with
dread over the thought there might
be something he had overlooked
some detail that wasnt perfect

 murder he had committed
murder he kept seeing mrs kin-
sella who had given him cookies
when he was a kid and had spoken
a good word for him when he ap-
plied for the job at the bank with
her face all covered with blood her
scream kept echoing in his mind

  some of the horror passed some
of the fear was allayed by his con-
fidence that all the suspicion would
focus on harry dreen

  cant let myself go to pieces he
whispered through dry lips which
kept sticking together mustnt let
anybody see im afraid

  the waiting was longer than he
had expected or perhaps it only
seemed longer presently he heard
the sounds he had been listening for
-gruff voices men walking hurry-
ing

  shoes pounded on the porch of the
boardinghouse the front doorbell
rang with loud and prolonged per-
sistence grumbling drowsily old
lovelock went padding down the
stairs carpet slippers flapping

  eric dreen recognized the rum-
bling voice of sam harker the
queen city chief of police frag-
ments of sentences reached eric
ashleys straining ears

 mrs kinsella-murder-trailed
the killer here

  poplovelocks voice bewildered
and shocked raised in horrified pro-
test must be some mistake chief
chief harker replied sure
theres been a mistake-the kind
murderers always make this one
is dumbern hell-leaving a clear
trail of footprints in the snow
straight from the kinsella house to
here damned if i ever did see any-
ing as dumb as that
the blue-black feet



  pop lovelock muttered something
again insisting it couldnt be possi-
ble that anybody who lived under
his respectable roof could be guilty
of such a hideous thing

  these footprints were made by
a mans shoes chief harker said
how many men you got boarding
with you now pop

 only-only two gulped love-
lock eric ashley who works in
the bank and harry dreen
couldnt hardly be eric ashley
rumbled the police chief there
was robbery done too if eric was
of a mind to steal he could get a
hell of a lot more from the bank
than hed find in a womans purse
eric ashley felt a great relief
that was the way hed had it figured
in the first place-because he worked
in a bank he was free of suspicion
as a housebreaker

 this other one-dreen the
chiefs voice went on what do
you know about him

  pop lovelock told what he knew
about harry dreen it wasnt
much

  hes always seemed to be a nice
enough feller said pop

 take me upstairs and show me
which is his room ordered chief
harker ought to be easy enough
to tell if hes the guilty man
harker and lovelock were com-
ing up the stairs two other men
trailed along behind harker
pushed open the door of harry
dreens room groped for the light
snapped it on

  harry dreen sat up in bed startled
and blinking

whats the matter he blurted
chief harkers eyes were hard
his mouth grim as he took one broad
stride across the narrow room and
picked up dreens clothes from the

chair he knew that the legs of the
trousers would be soaking wet even
before he touched them with his
hand he stooped down for the
shoes the worn leather was limp
from immersion then he lifted
one of the socks dangled it in mid-
air a few drops of dark-colored
water dripped down on the floor

  harry dreen continued to stare
what is all this he demanded
whats happened to my clothes
pop lovelock shook his head
sadly looks like he done it all
right he said

  stupidest piece of bungling i
ever saw growled the police chief
how he thought he was going to
get away with it i dont know
harry dreen flung back the bed-
covers and swung his legs down onto
the floor

  what is all this about anyhow
he demanded a second time it

seems ive got a right to know-

  chief harker didnt waste any
time a pair of handcuffs clinked in
his hand swiftly he leaned for-
ward and snapped them firmly about
harry dreens wrists almost before
the latter could anticipate what was
happening

  no use bluffing dreen and how
you could have been fool enough to
think you could get away with it
is beyond me the trail of foot-
prints you left for us to follow in

the snow-

  snow repeated harry dreen
maybe you figured it would all
be melted off the ground before day-
light rasped chief harker
maybe you didnt know mrs kin-
sellas maid would hear the woman
scream when you broke her skull
open with that tire iron and would
get the police station on the tele-
phone within less than five minutes


street  smiths detective story magazine

-and maybe youre just a plain
crazy damn fool who needed some
money mighty bad and was willing
to commit murder to get it

  harry dreen looked at his hand-
cuffed wrists he looked at his wet
clothes the water-soaked shoes in
a dull dazed bewildered way he
must have realized the seriousness
of his predicament he stood up
in his worn faded pajamas his face
gone a dead white the links of
the handcuffs jingled as he moved
his arms

 i dont know anybody named
kinsella he shouted i havent
been outside this house since nine
oclock tonight i dont know whos
trying to pin murder on me but its
certainly clear that somebody
sneaked in here got my clothes and
is trying to frame me

 the boardinghouse had been
startled awake doors were being
opened heads thrust out into the
hall in the adjoining room eric
ashley decided that he had better
bestir himself also it might look
peculiar if he remained too long
without making an appearance he
got out of bed turned on a light
and slipped into his dressing gown
he almost collided with helen ham-
lin as he rushed out into the hall

 what is it he demanded
whats all the excitement about
is the house on fire

  i-i dont know helen hamlin
answered uncertainly i heard-i
heard the word-murder and there
seems- they were now out-
side harry dreens door and her
eyes caught a glimpse of police uni-
forms yes its the police

 chief of police harker had
grabbed harry dreen roughly by the
shoulders and shoved him back
down upon the bed

  you killed that woman dreen

he roared you smashed her head
in with a piece of automobile spring
you got that piece of spring out of
pop lovelocks garage your foot-
prints go from the house to the
garage-and straight from the gar-
age to mrs kinsellas house

 you jimmied open the kitchen
window went upstairs and killed
her in cold blood when she woke up
and found you rummaging in her
bedroom

 helen hamlin screamed no
no she cried its not true it
couldnt be true

  harry dreen would have been an
unusual young man if he hadnt
been frightened his hands were
trembling a little

 thank you helen he said
thickly i didnt do it somebody

has tried to make it look-

  chief harker caught a glimpse of
eric ashley standing in the door-
way

  you ashley come on in here
you sleep on this floor eh

 eric ashley nodded yes he
answered mine is the next room to
dreens

 did you happen to hear dreen
moving about a little while ago-
coming in say about thirty minutes
before we got here

  for the barest instant ashley hesi-
tated his first impulse was to tie
harry dreen up just so much more
tightly by saying that he had heard
dreen come in but he thought it
might look better if he showed no
eagerness to clinch the ftllows
guilt

  im a pretty sound sleeper chief
i didnt hear anything until a mo-
ment or two ago when all this racket
woke me up

  chief harker shrugged his shoul-
ders well i was hoping maybe
the blue-black feet



you did eric but it doesnt make
much difference either way the
evidence weve got here-

  he poked at the clothes suddenly
frowned looking dawn at his hands
there was a bluish stain on his fin-
gers he looked at harry dreens
bare feet and the frown deepened

 humph he grunted thats
queer

 eric ashley for no reason he
could name felt a quick tingle of
uneasiness he knew that chief
harker was looking now at his bare
feet he hadnt stopped to put on
his slippers

  whats queer chief he blurted

  chief of police harker picked up
one of harry dreens dripping
socks squeezed it between his fin-
gers a trickle of darkly discolored
water oozed out left a bluish-black
stain upon his hand

  yeah he growled thats where
it came from all right must be
just about the cheapest pair of socks
a man can buy-for the color to
run in cold water

 whats queer about it eric
the queer thing is that dreen hasnt
got any of them dye stains on his
feet-and that you have

  eric ashley looked down at his
bare feet both of them had the
same discoloration that was on the

police chiefs hands-the cheap dye
from harry dreens socks it was
sufficient proof for anybody that
eric ashley had worn them tonight

 the room seemed to be mounted
on an axis spinning crazily about
him his temples were pounding
with a rush of blood to his head a
thousand explosions were inside his
brain

 through a mist he saw chief
harker taking the handcuffs from
harry dreen eric knew that in an-
other moment they would be on his
own wrists

  he knew they were going to ar-
rest him-now there wouldnt be
any chance to get the money from
the bucket of ferns tomorrow
morning the bank examiners would
discover his shortage chief harker
would find out he had cashed mrs
kinsellas check for fifteen hun-
dred dollars it would all be clear
there was no possible hope of es-
cape

 the room whirled faster in a
crazy confusion of mental pictures
he saw mrs kinsella with the blood
gushing down her face he thought
he heard her screaming again

  but the scream which rang in his
ears was his own it was the cry
of a man who knows that he is
damned beyond hope

chapter i

a model and a murder

ergeant keen and lieu-
tenant mcintyre with a lit-
tle assistance from detective
blair were giving the works
to jim lekton when it all started
keen was urging a case on lekton
he was saying so if youd take
this job on a contingent fee jim i
think maybe i could talk the woman
into giving it to you

  sure mcintyre said its good
dough for a rising young private
detective a five-dollar dogs lost
and you oughta be able to get him
back in two days the womanll

give you half the price of the dog
and a dollar and a quarter a day aint
bad pay jim

  not bad at all blair threw in
and just think next time she
might lose a ten-dollar dog

  gwan jim said good-naturedly
hang the razz on me have a good
time and when i quit on my in-
come you guysll still be working
for the city and shaving twice a day
so the civil service wont know you
got white whiskers

 keen pretended to be hurt is
that any way to talk jim when
were trying to throw a case your
way well thats the way it is men

a guy quits the force and right

s
jim lekton kicked over the table fritz had a gun out
                fritz was shooting-

away hes too good for his old pals
no fooling jim blair began
have you had a case yet i mean

one that pays-

  he broke off he even took his
hat from the back of his bald head
and held it in his hand mcintyre
straightened up on his high bench
and quietly pulled his blouse
straight keen fiddled importantly
with the wires on his switchboard

  because a girl had come in not
the sort of woman you might expect
in a station house at one in the
morning but an elegant girl a
gorgeous girl a girl in a red velvet
evening dress that swirled and
swayed to show very fine ankles in
five-dollar hose a little fur jacket
that was white but was definitely not
rabbit clung around her shoulders
jim lekton looked and said to
ds-

himself model because she
had the funny swaying walk that the
girls used in news reels not a
natural walk but a walk that was
meant to call attention to the walker
and to the clothes she wore well-
bred attention

  she walked her way to the desk
and stopped

 are you in charge here she
asked mcintyre

 yes maam the old boy was
a little fussed lieutenant mcin-
tyre maam

 her voice was very cultured a
little tired there was not a hair
out of place on her head my escort
just died she said in the taxi-
cab

  blair put his hat-on mcintyre
slumped forward on the desk keen
forgot to play with the wires


street  smiths detective story magazine

 jim lekton watched them and
he watched the girl too this was
a new one this was a honey

 mcintyre was asking youre
sure hes dead

  oh yes the girl said quite
he doesnt breathe and he is getting
cold those are the signs arent
they oh yes and he is a little stiff
rigor mortis thats called i think
she did not seem bored just matter-
of-fact a man was dead so you
dropped him off at the police station
on the way home if you had a
thirst you went to a bar if you
wanted cigarettes you went to the
cigar store if you had a corpse you
took it to a police station

  mcintyre dry-washed his hands
and said mr blair here is the de-
tective in charge

  blair gulped and said yeah
yeah the-the cabs outside

  she nodded

  blair tried to put on a hat that
was already on and started for the
door

  it was none of jim lektons busi-
ness but he was interested how
come you came in and not the cab
driver

  he disappeared the girl said
i went into the game pit to cash
a check and when i came out the
driver was gone and my escort was
dead poisoned i imagine there
was a peculiar odor in the car
blair in the front doorway
stopped howd you get here
why the girl drawled i drove
the cab i mean one is supposed to
report to the police at once isnt
one

 yeah yeah the detective
banged through the front door

  jim lekton suddenly said hi
and stepped behind the girl putting
up his arms he was just in time
she had fainted he stood there

holding her looking around help-
lessly

  mcintyre snapped out of his fog
and said inhere he slipped off
the bench held the door open to the
corridor there was a big waiting
room there with a tremendous table
in the middle of it

  lekton hoisted the girl in his
arms carried her in and put her on
the table mcintyre trotted for a
glass of water bringing it up he
said

 she-she seemed to be going
fine

  training jim said bringing out
a handkerchief and wiping the girls
forehead shes an actress or some-
thing was so scared she-well sort
of forced herself to talk that way
scared me

  scared you mcintyre said rub-
bing the girls wrists huh i was
so pop-eyed frightened at that cold
way she talked that i nearly fell off
the desk hi shes wakin up

  the girls eyes fluttered and she
whispered im-im all right

  take it easy kid jim lekton
said

  blair slammed down the corridor
from the back of the house saw
them and stuck his head in dead
o k prussic acid from the smell

i gotta- what happened to the

dame

 she fainted mcintyre said
whatd you do with the cab

  ran it around into the garage i
gotta phone headquarters blair
went into the front room

 shes saying something jim
said shut up mac

 the girl whispered im so-
tired could i lay here for a min-
ute

  jim said sure sure just lie
still he stole a glance at mcin-
tyre the lieutenant no grammarian
at best hadnt noticed anything
hunch player



 mcintyre said that dope
blairll forget to have them pick up
the cab driver i better go tell him
he slammed out too

  jim lekton frowned and then got
the girls gold mesh bag he opened
it it contained an enamel ciga-
rette case a lipstick and compact to
match the cigarette case three cards
saying the jaybella clothing co
and an address in the garment dis-
trict and an unpaid light bill for
eight dollars made out to leah stur-
devant  longvue boulevard

  mcintyre was evidently telling
blair how to be a detective at least
neither of them could be heard out-
side jim lekton looked at the
girls lovely smooth face and pock-
eted the light bill a lot of things
were coming clear to him

  the girl moved again and he said
  are you comfortable lady

  her eyelids fluttered her eyes
were the darkest brown he had ever
seen

  ill-ill get up in a second are
you arresting me

  he stole another glance at the
door im not a cop he said
quickly just a private dick they
may arrest you theyve sent for the
homicide squad and those headquar-
ters dicks are tough

  i couldnt pay you now she said

but if youd help me-

 he hadnt meant to there was
no money in this the whole thing
was too plain to him a model for
a clothing house an out-of-town
buyer who might pay the light bill
for an evenings entertainment pri-
vate detective agencies dont grow
on that set-up

  he started to say no and heard
himself saying yes if youll tell
me the truth did you kill him
no i swear it but i cant get
drug into--

  i know only for petes sake

watch your english thats the sec-
ond mistake youve made watch
your english and dont tell them

who you are and-

  blair came back in o k lady
she said anything yet jim

  lekton said no she asked for
water once

  the girl tried to sit up fluttered
jim carefully maneuvered blair so
the precinct detective was the one
who helped the lovely lady to sit
up it was a little funny to see fat
middle-aged blair getting red in the
face because he had his arm around
her shoulders because her head
rested on his chest

  a little funny but very serious
because the girls sex appeal and
her manner were all that stood be-
tween her and prison he was sure
of it with nothing at all to go on
except those two mistakes in gram-
mar lay and drug used in the
wrong places funny thing to use to
construct a whole series of future
events on

  blair was talking now little
lady we just want to know who
was this guy

  i-i dont know just mr far-
ber thats all i know

  you was out with him and you
dont know who he was blair was
still gentle but getting tougher a
nice girl like you out with a fella
you didnt know he clucked

  miss sturdevant shook her head
and big round tears crept out on

those smooth cheeks i-

  blair said now look lady come
across mebbe it wasnt murder
mebbe he just had a weak pump and
see it wouldnt never have to get

into the newspapers-

 outside jim lekton heard the
cars coming into the back yard the
homicide squad cars yeah mebbe
it wasnt murder an accident
maybe mr farber might have


street  smiths detective story magazine

thought he was a butterfly and
attempted to preserve himself for a
collection

  yeah maybe yes mebbe

  he lighted a cigarette and
watched old blair go around and
around in circles like a cow with
her tail tied to her horns go around
and get no place except red in the
face

  the girl was clever clever and
an actress and he was a sap to
take this case for no reason that
he could put his finger on not for
money because if his theory was
right leah sturdevant-a phony
name no doubt-had no money not
for love because he knew plenty of
pretty girls

  maybe just for the experience
jim lekton the student

  darrsel of the homicide squad
stuck his head in the door said
 lo blair poisoning all right-
potassium cyanide this the little
lady

  blair nodded then he looked
wise and motioned darrsel out of the
room jim lekton winked at the
girl and followed them

  blair shut the door carefully and
said lissen darsie this is some
society dame out with a pick-up for
a good time see now the dame
dont want to give her name and
thats o k with me

  how come darrsel asked
ten to one she done it

  sure said blair remember-
ing blairs arm around the girl
blairs fatherly manner jim lekton
was a little amazed that he had ever
been a cop himself sure she done
it only look shes got dough
once she has to tell us who she is
shell get one of them expensive law-
yers down here we dont insist on
her name and shell give us all night
to work on her without a mouth-
piece

  something in that darrsel said
stuffing his mouth with chewing to-
bacco yeah ill ask the skipper
that ought to be all right sud-
denly he saw jim lekton and said
whatchu doin here you aint a
cop no more are you

  thats right blair said scram
jim

  jim lekton scrammed

chapter ii

two tough men

e had one theory of the girl
and of the case and the
cops had another their
theory was that the girl was
a debutante who had been having an
affair with a man unknown to her
parents and the man had tried to
blackmail her so she killed him

  jims theory was that she was a
model who had simply entertained
an out-of-town buyer and the kill-
ing had nothing to do with the dress
business

  his theory had started with her
walk he had seen rich women and
they didnt walk like models or like
rich girls in movies they just
walked this girl hadnt

  then when he had opened her
bag and seen the bill and the busi-
ness cards he had known he was
right about the first step anyway

  maybe it was because he had been
right that he had gone ahead maybe
that ha flattered him into it

  he stopped at the first corner and
bought a paper his theory was
going to get tested right now he
looked for the column arrival of
buyers in the commercial section
ran through it and found that lester
farber was staying at the lincoln
pat too pat a man couldnt be
right all the time

  he caught a surface car for the
lincoln because taxis were beyond

h
hunch player



him he had resigned from the
force three months ago with the
grand saved up it was going fast
supporting a license and an agency
that had no customers

  it was after two when he slouched
into the lincoln three old women
scrubbed the lobby floor and the
desk clerk was asleep with his eyes
open but buyers dont court pri-
vacy they want to see as many
clothing salesmen as possible while
in town there was a big board-
this was a commercial hotel-and
one of the thirty names on it said
lester farber the busy bee and
then the name of the western city
in which farber conducted his store
and opposite all that the room num-
ber 

  still without waking the clerk
or arousing the interest of the three
scrub women jim lekton climbed
to the mezzanine no  was
locked but hotel locks were no great
problem in a couple of minutes he
was inside the living room of the
suite

  he switched on the light tossed
his hat on a table and stood hands
on hips looking the place over a
long table where salesmen could lay
out their stuff easy-chairs a file
of letters

  he tried the file first looked up
the jaybella clothing co yeah
here mr farber was on friendly
terms with mr jacob errin of the
jaybella company his letters-
there were carbons-all ended with
love to bella

  ordinary correspondence could
use a gross more of the no  
if your terms are satis-

  have you anything in your line
like a suit sort of a sports-

  boloney here was a letter that
told dear jake that lester would
be in the city next week and was
looking forward to some of bellas

rinderbrust whatever that was

  jim lekton pushed the files away
and walked around the room whis-
tling

  the door to the bedroom popped
open and a head stuck out jim
drew gun before he thought

  the mouth under the tousled hair
said what is this a circus or
are you selling dresses this hour
the night

 house detective jim said
smoothly you left your front door
unlocked i was looking over the
place to see if anything was missing
before i woke you mr farber

  diamonds im not selling far-
ber said but wait i look at my
wallet it was under my pillow

  he went and came back into the
light with the wallet there was
money in it but jim staring over
the mans shoulder didnt bother
with that there were identification
cards too one with a photograph
this was lester farber wrong
note

  jim apologized got out not ex-
actly sure what to do next

 so the dead man was not mr
farber but leah sturdevant had
said he was jim fished out the light
bill and studied it might as well
go see miss sturdevants place of
abode but there wouldnt be any-
thing there there wouldnt be any-
thing any place and jim lekton was
a sucker to try

  he walked up a hill behind the
hotel to the district known as the
heights along a parapeted walk
there with street lights making rec-
tangular lines below him he
stopped for a moment and looked
down from here at this time of
night the city looked like a honey-
comb only there had been mighty
little honey in it for jim lekton

  he sighed and turned his thin coat
collar up around his neck anyway

this was better than just doing noth-
ing except sit in his office and read

  he turned in from the promenade
and went through streets-some go-
ing uphill some going down-that
got progressively worse until he
came to leah sturdevants address

  the walk-up apartment in which
the girl received her gas bills was a
determined attempt to appear classy
without expense lots of metal
strips on plasterboard walls white
metal mail boxes instead of brass
bad modern decorations

  he worked the front door lock
without resistance any door that
must open to a half hundred keys
will open to the fifty-first

  but leah sturdevants door was a
little harder a lot harder he
tried it with everything he had and
then started for the hall window and
a fire escape and supposing some
patrolman heard him and turned a
light up good-by little license
you never did me much good any-
way

  he was sliding the hall window
open as quietly as he could when a
voice behind him said

  hold it just like you are

  he held it his hands were
against the window sill in plain
sight

  a man came down the hall behind
him without any noise at all and
took jim lektons gun then he
said

o k turn around and come on
in the dim hall light the man was
moe mccall known as gumshoe
a two-time loser holdup man and
occasional loft robber

  lekton said o k gumshoe
where are we heading

gumshoe said you know cop-
per back into the girls apartment
jim lekton gave a wink that
meant anything or nothing and
meekly followed gumshoe back to

leah sturdevants apartment

  gumshoe stopped at the door
called o k fritz were coming
in and opened the door they
went in together and there was a
brief moment when jim might have
made a play for gumshoes gun but
fritz lieber was sitting across the
room watching them and fritzs
record was about like gumshoes
only fritz was known to be tougher

  jim said welcome home boys
i thought you two were on the lam
he lounged over to a day bed and
sat down leaning on one elbow
crossing his legs

  wise guy said fritz

  jim paid no attention nice place
you got here boys shows the
womans touch where did you two
plug-uglies get a dame to take care
of you

  he kept his face casual his glances
indirect but he thought maybe he
had scored a little puzzlement
passed from one mug to the other

  jim stretched and the guns in the
mugs hands moved all right
boys the skippers waiting down-
stairs for you hand over your guns
and i wont tell any one you were
carrying them

  listen copper- gumshoe be-
gan

  fritz said harshly he aint a
cop he quit the force months ago
jim lekton sighed the bluff
hadnt worked not at all he had
taken his cue from gumshoes mis-
take but fritz was not only tougher
he was smarter and he read the
newspapers

  youre a private dick fritz said
so-who you working for

jim grinned that would be vio-
lating my personal code of ethics
fritz lieber swore and came
across the room on his heavy bowed
legs

  you cut it out he said bitterly
hunch player



cut out them long words you
think were fooling you rat
gumshoe yelled easy fritz
but it was too late the barrel of
fritzs gun slashed at jim lektons
jaw yellow lights broke across jims
eyes and his head rocked he had a
vague idea he was flying and then
he picked himself up off the floor
while blood began to drip down on
his topcoat shoulder

  thanks fritz he said quietly
the words came out with difficulty
his jaw felt as though it had been
torn loose at the roots ill remem-
ber that when i make my pinch
fritz leaned forward from the
chair he had resumed there was no
apology in his voice thats to
show you we aint fooling who
you working for

  jim lekton felt the cut on his
jaw gingerly i guess youre not
fooling he said slowly i guess
not listen if i told you the truth
would you believe it

  fritz said try it it wouldnt
sound funny from a guy that used to
be a cop

  all right this girl youre wait-
ing for came into the station house
to-night the fourth precinct she
said the guy with her was dead
poisoned i took the case on blind
because im broke and because her
clothes looked like money

  gumshoe laughed thats where

you was wrong shes-

 shut up gumshoe fritz
snapped whatd she say the guy
was

  a mr farber jim lekton said
a dress buyer

  fritz said o k

  jim lekton should have expected
it he should have known but
maybe the pistol whipping had made
him foggy he realized as gum-
shoes gun cracked on his hat that

  this was next but it was too late
then

 he was out

chapter iii

the hunch

ome men are tougher than
others jim lekton was
tough as hard as nails
thus he was walking around
the apartment walking around in
circles minutes before he was con-
scious again there was enough in
him to pull his legs together get him
up start him moving without the
conscious part of his brain knowing
what he was doing

 when he found out he stopped
walking and dropped into the chair
that fritz had used his head felt
terrible the rest of him didnt feel
very good his topcoat was a mess
and there was a hole in his hat

  he wandered around till he found
the door that led to the bathroom-
first starting into a closet a kitchen-
ette and the hall-and took three
aspirin tablets they couldnt do
much harm afterward he found
some gin in the kitchenette and
took a slug of it it couldnt do
much good

  when the gin and the aspirin quit
fighting for the possession of his
interior he prowled the one-room
flat looking for anything at all that
might give him a clue

 movie magazines clothes an old
sunday newspaper hats a pamphlet
on the care of the complexion
shoes a fifty-cent fashion magazine
and a letter in a prison envelope

 he backed up to the day bed and
turned the letter over in his hands
not because he was reticent about
opening other peoples mail but be-
cause this had to be a clue to what-
ever was going on had to be it
was the only chance he had

s

  he opened it and it started dear
sis and he began to have hope

dear sis

  so things aint as bad as i thought i
am in the kitchen now and it is better
than the broomshop at least you get
plenty to eat chow is plain but not
cooked dirty like the cons say we have
to wash our hands before we even peel
potatoes

  if you see g and f you know who i
mean-

  here the prison censor had taken
a razor blade and cut out a para-
graph the letter ended

  so i will be out in ten months and
glad to see you but not some other people
except like i say

              your loving brother

joe

  jim lekton hoped that he was
thinking straight g was for gum-
shoe and f was for fritz and from
the last line-which the censor had
not been smart enough to cut-when
joe got out of prison he was going
to fix gumshoe and fritz a good
job too

  lekton put the letter in his pocket
and stood up he had to lean against
the wall for a moment to stop his
head from going around but it
stopped and he went and got the
book on care of the complexion
it said leah rosow  sturdevant
street

  that was where she had got the
elegant name she had used when
her brother was sent up and she be-
came a model rosow joe rosow
yeah a year and a day for loft rob-
bery offered clemency by the dis-
trict attorney because of his youth
and his clean record-if he would
tell the names of his confederates
and the whereabouts of the money
that had been in the loft safe
caught because he had given a piece
of the stolen silk to a neighbor whod
just had a baby

  being a dick in a small city had
its drawbacks when it came to get-
ting clients but it was all right when
it came to remembering major
crimes

 what jim lekton would have
called a hunch or a more educated
man have called deduction began to
crawl around in his head

 joe rosow hated gumshoe and
fritz his sister would know about
that they had got the kid to take
the rap and then run out on him
so there would be only one thing
that would make leah rosow of
sturdevant street have anything to
do with the two mugs

  getting joe out of prison was the
answer so mr farber miscalled
was the one who was going to engi-
neer either a break or a pardon and
the mugs had left leah the hard job
of contacting him

  jim lekton left the apartment
still unsteady on his heels he
walked to a trolley track there were
waiting booths all along the tracks
and they had phones in them

 leah of sturdevant leah van
sturdevant leah de sturdevant
he must tell the girl all the elegant
combinations he had thought out for
her name

  leah de la rue sturdevant that
was hot that was fine

 the cold wind found its way
through his torn hat and gnawed at
the bump gumshoe had given him
his heels beat a little tattoo on the
pavement

  he found a booth dropped in a
nickel sighing at the expenditure
police headquarters citizens
ought to be allowed to call the police
for nothing he put a handkerchief
over the mouthpiece talked out of
the corner of his mouth if youse
guys wanta know somethin about
that farber kill you pick up gum-
shoe mccall and fritz lieber he
hunch player



dropped the phone gently back into
its cradle while the patrolman opera-
tor was still asking who is this
calling and stumbled away from
there

  it was three thirty in the morn-
ing and he had two dollars to his
name and if darrsel and the rest
of the homicide squad ever found out
that leah had a con brother they
would turn her over to the matrons
and there was nothing motherly
about some of those headquarters
matrons

  what next what next if he were
still a cop he could go up the river
and talk to joe rosow tell him they
were going to put his sister away
and maybe rosow would help him
but he wasnt a cop

  well back-trail the girl said she
had gone into the game pit to cash
a check the game pit was a road-
house and-

 the cops would be there any-
way it would be closed now

  the taxi driver had disappeared
while she was cashing the check
and she really had cashed a check
because she would know the cops
would check on a thing like that

  o k then find the hackie the
cops would be doing that too but
maybe he could do it faster or
smarter he knew the other end
of the case knew what it was all
about those dumb flatties would
still be working on the blackmail
angle

  he wondered how leah de la rue
sturdevant was making out at head-
quarters all right he supposed
give that doll half a chance and
she would do just fine smart girl
good actress pretty girl maybe
the prettiest he had ever seen

  he constructed little pieces of in-
formation and happenings together
to make a plausible whole and then
moved crosstown to a street where

he could flag a night owl cab he
spent sixty cents to get to the fourth
precinct station

  gin plus torn hat plus glassy
stare-a drunk it was good he had
had that snort of liquor at leahs
apartment it made the act work
now

  the clock over mcintyres desk
said four stumbling in jim lek-
ton gave the desk a sloppy salute
reeled toward the stairs to the de-
tective squad office

 keen called hey jim where
you think youre going

  upstairs sleep

 you dont work here no more
howd you get such a big one so
quick

  mcintyre said disinterestedly
hes been gone about four hours
it is a pretty good one though
jim lekton kept boring for the
stairs he walked as though he were
going into a high wind keen came
around the switchboard put an arm
around jims shoulders said-
now jim you cant sleep in the
squad room youre not a cop any
more

  wanta go to bed wanta take a
cold cold shower and go to bed
whod you have the fight with
shower cold shower the
switchboard buzzed

  aw let him go upstairs mc-
intyre called and come handle
your calls theres nobody up there
but blair he wont mind

 keen let jim go while he an-
swered the switchboard and jim
made it to the old familiar stairs a
few months ago he had been in
charge of this squad now he was a
drunken bum the squad let sleep on
its cot no matter

  he acted a good deal soberer when
he hit blairs office hello blairsy
gome a skinful and tried to show
a truck driver jujutsu


street  smiths detective story magazine

  blair had been lying on one of the
cots shut up and leme get some
sleep

  jim stripped off his clothes and
went into the shower he could use
a shower he banged around enough
to get blair wide awake when he
came back blair was sitting up
dressed except for his coat a blanket
pulled around his shoulders

  jim lekton knew he was all right
now you cant kick a friend out
without his clothes on he put on
his underwear caught up a blanket
wrapped it around him indian
fashion

  blair said gwan get outta here
the day shift is due in a couple of
hours

  three four jim said he took
a cigarette from blairs package on
the desk howd that case make
out you had before

  you might pass me one of my
own cigarettes blair said aw
the gal did it i guess headquar-
ters took her away theyll send up
for the taxicab to-morrow blair
said and there was no longer any use
in jim lektons staying there

  lets go get a drink jim said
cmon blairsy lets go buy a
drink

  im on duty blair protested
anyway its after closing hours

 a drink jim bawled he
pounded on the desk gotta have
a drink mr private detective lek-
ton and his friend mr first class
detective blair are going to have a
drink

  shut up blair said shut up
or ill have to cool you this is a
police station

  so thats the way you treat old
friends jim said with drunken dig-
nity he reached for his clothes
who was it made you first class
me when i was a sergeant me-

  blair twitched uneasily look

jim no hard feelings see here
heres five bucks go buy us a bot-
tle an look you better go out the
back way in case some of the in-
spectors snoops are around

 jim nodded knew i could
count on old blair but he had to
fumble dressing so blair wouldnt
get suspicious he wandered away
finally down the backstairs hum-
ming a little

 not bad he had got a shower
to cool his battered head five bucks
to go ahead with and a legitimate
reason to go into the stations back
yard and look at the taxicab

  not bad at all he endured the
cool pity of the cop on guard back
there as he stumbled and half
lurched into the cab long enough
to find out that the drivers name on
the license was guffson unusual
name he endured being helped out
of the yard by the cop like any other
drunken has-been

  there was an all-night cab stand
down on the corner he took a cab
on the strength of blairs five-dollar
bill and said

  take it home pal

  the name on this license was rob-
ert callaly he noticed idly as the
driver said

 wheres home

  the stable jim said i gotta
make the rounds of the garages
hack department cop

 callaly said oh youre not
turning me in for anything

  no jim said what have you
done no you get paid for this
ride callaly

  i was worried callaly said on
account o theres a crumpled fender
im gonna change her to-morrow

 see that you do jim lekton
said and pretended to make a note
in his book

  he leaned back on the cushions
a couple of hours till dawn leah
hunch player



wouldnt tell them who she was
girls that have convict brothers
know enough to realize that they
havent got a chance with the cops
if that gets out and shed outbluff
them-if only nobody spotted her
occasional lapses in grammar that
gave her away without that they
could go on thinking she was a so-
ciety girl and as long as they treated
the matter as blackmail they would
stay far far away from the truth

  he must have fallen asleep be-
cause the driver was shaking him
here we are inspector

  jim grinned and climbed out of
the cab paying the exact fare no-
body expects a tip from a cop he
strolled into the first garage

  there were only six garages in
town licensed by the hack bureau
they were all close together across
the street were clothiers offering
specials in hack uniforms second-
hand tire dealers accessory stores

  he headed for the light in the of-
fice looking back the driver who
had brought him here was gone

 bonding company jim said
showing his private badge just
want a look at your books

  the office man said fine time
of night

  only time im sure of catching
some of these hackies at home jim
said carelessly thumbing through
the book no guffson he pretended
to copy an address or two wandered
on out

  it was immediately apparent in the
second garage that the word had
gone out there was a cop making
the rounds he didnt get a chance
to use his story about the bonding
company well that made him
guilty of impersonating an officer
but it was too bad

  the third garage had guffsons
name and an address across town
the office man was a wispy old boy

as bald as an egg

 headquarters dicks in here
earlier he said importantly
homicide squad

  theyre big shots jim said i
wouldnt know about that

  they picked up a stiff in a cab
out on the road seemed mad about
it

  every time those guys have to
work they get mad jim said and
got out

  oh this was bad he didnt dare
take a cab to guffsons the word
was out he was a cop who had been
nosing around the stables hack
drivers had a grapevine they were

a close bunch of-

  it was an hours walk but maybe
he could find a surface car he
walked toward the tracks oh quit
it and go home whats in it for
you maybe the girlll get out by
herself maybe she is guilty only
guilty or not theyll hang it on her
if they know about her brother it
isnt right but who are you jim
lekton to worry about right or
wrong it isnt right either that
you should starve for lack of busi-
ness but its true between being so
and being right there is a gap

  it is jim lekton because you are
in love with that girl the leah
rosow that leah de la rue sturde-
vant that leah van sturdevant
you sap you sucker to love a girl
you have seen once a girl with a stir
brother a girl you know nothing
about except that she looks like a
million dollars and makes little mis-
takes in her english

  light fog was coming down over
the city and a drunk reeled along
followed by a cat and panhandled
jim for two bits he gave the drunk
a dime and watched him reel away
the alley cat still following him
hopefully one bum hoping the other

leah

bum would lead the way to a free
lunch

  there you go jim lekton thera
you go a dick who was conceited
enough to quit the force a sergeant
and waive his pension conceited
enough to start a private agency
there you go dragging down the
gutter panhandling for drinks of
smoke

  and who are you to love a girl
named leah

  a surface car came clanging along
and he got aboard

chapter iv

the double-crosser

he entrance to guffsons
tenement house was smelly
with cabbage and babies and
too much living from prac-
tice jim figured out the location of
the guffson flat from the location
on the wall of the mail box and
climbed the rickety stairs

  cheap as leahs place had been
you could get a five-room flat here
for half the price of her one room

  climbing jim lekton did not
touch the rail because he had been
in enough of these places before
to know that the rail would be
greasy he had a horror of dirt
maybe it was because he had been
born in a place like this himself

  here this would be the door no
cop in the corridor probably no cop
inside he scratched on the splin-
tery panel now came the test of all
his hunches now he was either right
or wrong he would know before
he scratched a second time

  right

  some one was awake some one
was inside on guard waiting a
woman she said

  what do you want

  guffie back yet jim asked
they would call the hack driver
hunch player



guffie any mugs would

 what do you want

  gumshoe sent me up here to find
out why he aint showed jim lek-
ton said

  the woman cried oh lord oh
lordy and the door flew open as
she staggered back he-he aint
showed the scrawny woman asked
her hand clawing at her throat over
the woolen nightgown

 not never jim said where
could he be

  the woman sat down on a rocker
with a wire-mended arm it was
noticeable how even in her grief her
excitement she remembered to pull
her wrapper aside so it would not
catch on the wire i told him to
stay away from bums like you she
said sullenly cops all over the
place at night the neighbors hang-
ing down the air shaft hearing the
cops in here at night evidently
she was used to cops by daytime it
was nocturnal police that annoyed
her

 cops give you much trouble
jim asked

 trouble the woman took a
deep breath to tell him how much
trouble they had given they said
if he showed up and didnt report
right away they was going to take
away his license so then wherell
we be i suppose that fine fritzll
support us yes he will on the
townsend plan running around
with bums and having the cops come

in at-

  its too bad mrs guffson jim
said quickly only-why didnt
guffie come back to the game pit
the game pit the game pit
so thats where gumshoe and fritz
went after telling poor jason to meet
them at borgys no wonder he

hasnt- she began to cry and

all night me sitting here seeing him
dead in a gutter some place his

poor head- she choked

  jim said well ill go to borgys
and pick him up he edged over to
the door

  she had to heap some more con-
tumely on him before she let him
go but inside jim lekton was con-
gratulating himself all his hunches
were good hunches he had had a
hunch that gumshoe and fritz
wouldnt dare show up at guffsons
apartment because they would be
afraid of cops but he had known
cop routine and known they
wouldnt hang around guffsons be-
cause cops beve that hack drivers
are so afraid of losing their licenses
that they will do what the cops tell
them

 he banked and edged and got
away

  borgys borgys a restaurant
or lunch room probably a lunch
room where cheap mugs and hack
drivers would meet

  while he rambled the streets look-
ing for a drug store and a phone
book he thought maybe im not
in love with her maybe i just
wanted a case to run off sos i could
prove i could still do em up neat
like when i was on the force im
not tired i dont need my sleep i
can sleep all night in that thirty-
buck-a-month office of mine ive
had enough sleep what i ought to
do is go back on the force this
is what i love not a girl not money
but the working out of a case get-
ting one hunch after another mak-
ing them all dovetail in coming out
with the solution

 a lunch room yielded a phone
book with a classified section that
showed up one possibility borgias
coffee pot on third not far

  he went back into the false dawn
that made the city streets look dirty
and littered somewhere near by
paralleling his course a sprinkler


street  smiths detective story magazine

truck hissed along washing the lit-
ter of yesterday into the gutter in
time for to-days filth to be spread
out

  he chuckled a little at a lunch
room named borgias name your
poison gents then he came to
third and the water sprinkler met
him he stopped a moment to ad-
mire the way it crawled along the
cool jets of water hitting the street
rolling up dust and paper washing
it down into the gutters and so
away

  like that you turned your mind
on a case like that and all the mess
washed away leaving it like that
strip of black glistening pavement
-a blank for you to write your solu-
tion on to-morrow he would put
in his application to rejoin the force
he would lose his first-class pay
but retain his sergeancy better than
starving better than letting your
mind get rusty

  he walked along and saw his end
ahead of him he would get to be a
captain not an inspector because
that required departmental politics
and he was no good at politics he
would get to be a captain and then
sooner or later they would retire him
on half pay and he would take a
cottage on the edge of the city and
the neighbors would ask him to see
who was stealing their newspapers
off their steps or which kid wrote
in chalk on the garage wall because
he had been a detective once

  well it was something it was
something high for a slum kid to rise
to captain of detectives only
he had seen his fame written larger

 and here was borgias white
tile nickeled coffee urn like a hun-
dred others in this small city and
there were gumshoe and fritz sit-
ting at a marble-topped table look-
ing unhappy and a third man with
them guffson probably

  all right boy think think hard
ten minutes to four he didnt have
a gun so he would have to get the
cops into this somehow dumb cops
who had not been able to find gum-
shoe fritz or guffson dumb dumb
cops

  ten minutes to four middle shift
on at midnight off at eight dog-
watch shift the city became a map
in front of his eyes yes all right
this was radio car patrol stuff this
part of town and he wanted about
ten minutes though five would do

  he backed away hunted up an-
other of those trolley-shed phones
first call theres a man in my
back yard- first i gotta get
back home we dont have no phone
im in a trolley shed in my night-
clothes

  count thirty and picture the radio
cars going there getting people up
yelling carrying on and leaving
their radios unattended so that the
cars from the next district would
have to come on for this call all
right second nickel handkerchief
corner of mouth you dumb flat-
foots want gumshoe and fritz and
that hackie guffson theyre in bor-
gias the coffee pot

  now run run like hell lekton
and maybe all the pieces will shake
down into your puzzle and youll
have a pretty pretty picture

  he trotted back to borgias lunch
room going as fast as he could with-
out losing his breath no use arriv-
ing out of breath giving himself
away he stopped outside the door
settled his clothing strolled in he
was halfway to the table before
fritzs startled eyes picked him up

  jim lekton grinned and shook his
head spreading his hands wide to
show he had no gun he didnt
hurry in the rest of his walk to the
table but he wished he could this
was nervous work walking up un-
hunch player



armed on two gun carriers like gum-
shoe and fritz

  he sat down at the table yelled
coffee at the counter and leaned
back

  well he said mornings nearly
here

  so what

  gumshoe was sulky sleepy fritz
appeared tired but still alert the
cab driver only looked sullen

  so the game ends then jim lek-
ton said the cops are on their
way here now dawnll find you
three in your cells they already
picked up your wife guffie and
theyve phoned the prison to bring
rosow down for questioning

 i dunno what youre talking
about fritz said but he licked his
lips nervously

  guff son said hes bluffing
huh fritz hes throwin a bluff
aint he the hackie was pathetic
a stupid poverty-racked man who
had fallen into bad hands

 sure fritz said they
wouldnt bother your old lady hes
bluffing

  five minutes ten minutes and
youll hear the sirens jim lekton
said put that gun away fritz
put it away better still throw it
out the window and you too gum-
shoe and give me back my rod
youre better off if they dont find
you armed

  fritz told him obscenely to scram
jim lekton had never taken his
eyes off the clock on the wall time
time and more time if he could
pull a gun if he had a half dozen
cops at his back and could start beat-
ing on fritz or gumshoe he might
hurry this up they had to talk
before the cops got there had to
or he was sunk and the whole thing
fell back to-a convicts sister killed
a sucker

  whos this guy guff son asked
suddenly

  private dick fritz said care-
lessly

 oh the insurance company
guffson asked

  yes jim lekton said quickly
sure we want to find out where
that money is we had to replace
it my companyll pay five grand
to get it back five grand in cold
money against that hot dough or
well pay five hundred for proof it
wasnt all in that safe even if
rosows the only one who knows
where the dough is if he just had
proof that they claimed more than
they really had in that loft safe we
could-

 rosows the only one knows
where the dough is guffson said
hodson was goin to get him in his
cell an show him the note from his
sister sos hed-

  shut up fritz said

  there was a car coming up out-
side the cops without their be-
loved sirens jim lekton held his
breath knowing that if it were the
cops now his chances of breaking
the case-while better-were still
one in a hundred but let it be the
cops he was at a dead end he
was through he was getting no
place

  it wasnt the cops it was a truck
that slowed and heaved a big bundle
of newspapers at the door of bor-
gias the counter man slopped by
setting jim lektons coffee in front
of him half in the saucer half in the
cup and then lounged to the front
door fishing a knife out of his
pocket he opened the door pulled
in the pile of newspapers cut the
string that bound them and shuffled
back

  fritz said give us one of those

  the counter man acted as though
he hadnt heard jim lekton sipped


street  smiths detective story magazine

his coffee it was very bad coffee
fritz was going up front for a paper
jim lekton watched him

  he said take the reward money
and scram

  you got it with you guffson
asked his voice was eager

  jim lekton prayed oh let the
cops come let them come i can
bluff this out now i can break this
case

  fritz said harshly you cheap
lying shamus

 he threw the newspaper at jim
lekton and as it hit the coffee on the
table spilling it jim got a quick
flash of a large picture of leah
rosow and a huge caption who
is this beauty

 but jim lekton was busy he
kicked over the marble-topped table
and gumshoe squawked as the hot
coffee went in his lap

  fritz had a gun out fritz was

shooting-

  the bullet went two inches over
jim lektons shoulder and cracked
the table top as the counter man
begged

  not in here guys not in here
jim made a violent grab and got
gumshoes wrist and guffsons
ankle he pulled twisted and
lifted and the three of them became
one mass of bawling heaving flesh
somewhere in the middle of this
there was a gun and probably two
and in all probability jim lekton
was doomed

  a face came up at him and he hit
it with an elbow at the same time
sinking his teeth into an offered
wrist something nearly broke all
his ribs-a shoe-as he thought de-
tachedly of the old joke about the
wrestler who bit himself

  he rolled still hanging on to what
he had-an ankle and a wrist-and
realized that fritz was still in the
front of the shop emptying his gun

  something smashed into jim lek-
tons face blinding him a bullet a
fist a head or a foot

  he couldnt see but he put the
wrist over the ankle and jerked a
bone cracked in one or the other

  the warm stuff running down his
leg was probably coffee kicked and
battered and bitten and butted a
man couldnt tell whether he had
been shot too or not

  it was the wrist that had broken
it felt loose and floppy in his hand
he let it go and then as his sight
cleared saw a face and used his
free hand to grab for the throat
under it he was tightening down
on that throat when a gun went off
much closer than fritzs gun and
there was no use squeezing the
throat any more because it was
limp

  he rolled still holding the ankle
and got clear to his knees it was
guffsons ankle and guffson was
lying in a good deal of blood a
revolver was held loosely in his
fingers it was jim lektons re-
volver

  gumshoe he saw quickly was a
dead adjunct to the coffee pot and
fritz was gone

  jim lekton took his gun back and
staggered to his feet he was pretty
bloody and well paintfed with coffee
but the blood didnt seem to be his
own

  he tried to run to the front door
because it was necessary to catch
fritz and the counter man came
up from behind his counter and hit
him with a wooden mallet

 jim lekton turned and put one
shaky hand in the counter mans face
and shoved the greasy vest ducked
down behind the counter again
though the push could have had no
force

  yellow jim said just yel-
low but he couldnt run after
hunch player



fritz because his feet werent track-
ing

 he turned and dragged back to
the mess their fight had left on the
floor he went to his knees next to
guffson and said	v

  o k hackie come clean
guffson looked at him the whites
of his eyes rolling and babbled some-
thing red bubbling froth came out
of the cabmans mouth

 jim managed to get water from
the counter spilling most of it in
his erratic progress maybe water
wasnt the best thing for a bullet-
pierced hackman but there was no
time to take a course in medicine
he held the liquid up to the hackies
mouth and guffson drank said
tanks i guess im trough
youre through jim lekton
said fritz shot hell out of you
that fritz is gun-simple

 tough guy i needed-dough
sure sure i saw your old lady
that was a lie i told you the cops
wont bother her

 good oke i-i shouldnt a
got mixed up wit fritz

  too late for that lekton said
softly you double-crossed him
yah yah rosow an me was
takin the money to-to him i
talked the kid inta lettin me stash
it when the cops showed under the
front seat rosow an me let the
cops think he had just picked me

  so you killed this hodgson that
was going to spring rosow

  took two grand from his pocket
the-the girl had raised it fer her
brother

  hodgsons a prison guard

 ds-

  outside hot sun suddenly took
the mist off the street and the day
had started somewhere fritz
lieber was loose rambling around
the city somewhere the cops were
on their deliberate way to this place
it didnt matter now nothing much
mattered except that guffson should
live long enough to talk

  the hackie tried he tried with
all that was left in him but it didnt
do any good he said ugh once
but that red froth came again and
jim had to stagger for more water
then the fool had to say thanks
let that go jim cried whos
hodgson

  why hes- guffson said and

died

  on which note the cops stormed
in the front door and a sergeant
made the classic inquiry

  whats going on here

chapter v

on trial

dim lekton opened his
eyes and darrsel said con-
temptuously

- tough luck fella you

didnt die

 thanks jim said nice of
you

  but youll wish you had darrsel
said the skipper dont like cops
that go bad he spat on the floor
of the headquarters room where jim
lekton lay in a bed and then
opened the door stuck his head out
in the hall hes come to
outside somebodys big feet
pounded away

 they wanted to take you to a
hospital darrsel said you and
your pals sure used up a lot of bul-
lets the doc took two out of you
i didnt even know i was shot
jim said so the story is i was one
of them


street  smiths detective story magazine

  yeah darrsel said lighting a
cigar stool pigeon for a bunch of
crooks hanging around the station
house telling them what the cops
next move was

  pretty story jim lekton said
yeah aint it when we get
through with you were going to
turn you over to the fourth they
was sorry for you thought you hung
around cause you were lonely

  jim lekton said  i been thinking
of rejoining the cops now i think

darrsel laughed big-wind lek-
ton sergeant at twenty-seven con-
vict at thirty and a big windbag all
the time well windy this is one
you dont talk yourself out of

  it was having to associate with
guys like you that made me quit the
force jim said

  yeah darrsel put the cigar in
the corner of his mouth and ad-
vanced on the bed his eyes gleam-
ing me im like the skipper i
dont like cops that go wrong
neither

  a knock on the door brought him
away from the bed he opened the
door and promptly removed the
cigar came to attention

  captain lange homicide squad
chief followed the commissioner
into the room

  the commissioner said feel up
to talking lekton

  jim said certainly sir i be-
lieve that we should hold a com-
missioners meeting marshal our
evidence and then take it to a
magistrates court for record

  the skipper whistled boy what
nerve even gonna run his own
trial

  my trial jim hitched himself
up on the pillows attempted to put a
jaunty note into his voice why
i cleaned up that hodgson killing

was how i got these and an old
case too

  i wish i could believe you my
boy the commissioner said but
you were found in a lunch room
after a gun battle with three wanted
men and your bullets were sprayed

all over-

  wheres the girl jim asked
the society girl who came into the
fourth last night

  im afraid the skipper said
that hes bluffing lekton shes no

society gal shes-

  a dress model and the sister of
rosow who took the rap in a loft
robbery a few months ago jim
said and the man she was sup-
posed to kill was named hodgson
and he was really killed by a cab
driver named guffson who con-
fessed before he died

  got it in writing the skipper
asked

  i want a hearing jim said i
can make this thing hang together
you picked up fritz lieber

  he ran into the squad cars two
blocks from that lunch room the
commissioner said

  it was apparent to jim lekton that
the commissioner wanted him to
clear himself well maybe he could
there were a lot of holes in his story

  the commissioner gave himself
away he said if you could pos-
sibly explain your part in this mess
-that is before the newspapers be-
gin to-

  afraid of scandal afraid they
would say the whole fourth precinct
had been working hand in glove with
the mugs yeah and wouldnt the
newspapers love it

  he moved experimentally in his
bed i-i think i could get up
it would be better and a hearing
in the trial commissioners room
how soon the commissioner
asked
hunch player



  in half an hour and may i have
the commissioners permission to
look up some old records he hap-
pened to glance at darrsel when he
said this and the dick looked nerv-
ous jim grinned at him i want
the reports on the rosow case
darrsel relaxed and jim decided to
look into mr darrsel sometime but
probably it was no more serious than
drinking on duty

  the commissioner said yes he
snapped the skipper to him with his
chin and they marched out

  help me dress jim told darrsel
and then i want to go to the
library

  when he came out from the li-
brary he felt as though he had been
dieting on broken bottles for a year
there was nothing in him that didnt
hurt funny he hadnt known when
he was shot and now that he knew it
it hurt so much youd think a shot
that you didnt feel couldnt be very
serious

  it was eight oclock when he went
into the trial room leaning on darr-
sels arm and then he saw the girl
-leah rosow leah sturdevant
leah de la rue sturdevant-and he
knew that it was worth it he
walked over to her said softly

  so they drug you in leah de la
rue sturdevant

  youre too fresh she said all
you cops are fresh

  but you havent been crying he
said dont you see that makes it
worth while you didnt cry you
thought they were going to send you
up for murder but you didnt cry
he changed his voice feeling darr-
sel restive did the cab driver give
hodgson a cigarette

  she nodded

  he said and hodgson was an
official at the prison

  a dentist she said he visited
the-

  got it jim lekton turned and
darrsel had to catch his arm because
one of the bullets had been in his
thigh

  jim staggered over and took a seat
in the front row this was the dread
room where the deputy commis-
sioner heard the trial of cops accused
of bad conduct well he was on
trial here though no longer a cop
he took out his private shield and
pinned it on his coat darrsel took
out his own proud first grade badge
and did the same

  a stenographer in a patrolmans
alpaca office coat came in and
glanced curiously at jim lekton
then they brought in fritz lieber
and the hearing was on

  jim lekton took the stand there
was no oath because this was not a
trial he said i cant entirely ex-
plain my part in this not unless
you look at leah rosow there

when i saw her last night-

  the commissioner said stick to
the facts

  jim lekton gulped and said all
right say then i had a hunch a
hunch she wasnt guilty but i
opened her bag when she fainted and
i saw from it she was poor-an un-
paid light bill so on not a debu-
tante when they threw me out of
the station house i went to her
apartment lieber there and gum-
shoe mccall jumped me so i knew
my hunch had been right

  youre not making sense the
commissioner said sharply your

  im not delirious jim lekton
said i tell you im talking
straight listen this is what hap-
pened gumshoe and fritz-mccall
and lieber-wanted to hold up a
loft they got guffson and young

sons car then the dentist wants
a drink and the girl gets out to get
it and guffson slips him a cigarette
because he cant allow a note to go

ride em bad boy

ronchos for bad boys-thats the prescription of w h mitchell
former psychiatrist at the kansas state penitentiary at his sunset
ranch near boulder colorado he has gone into the business of
rehabilitating youths who are on the verge of losing control of
themselves

    mr mitchell accepts commitments by juvenile judges but prefers to
discover boys who are on the ragged edge before they appear in court
this contact is made through parents who realize that their sons are taking
steps which are leading them toward trouble and beyond the barriers
accepted by society the aim is to restore youths to normalcy when they
are threatened with losing their grip on contact with others

    consistent discipline is used by mr mitchell in helping the boys solve
problems with which they are confronted the split discipline exercised
by a doting mother and a stern father or the reverse is of no help to the
maladjusted youth the psychiatrist believes

    the sunset ranch boys who become adjusted to school life are enrolled
in boulder high school while those faced with maladjustment in their
school work are tutored at the ranch each boy has two horses for which
he must care he makes his own bed and has certain obligations to meet
conferences are held with the youths to aid them in freeing themselves
of either inferiority complexes or egoism

murderers macic

a true
crime story

      hen new york city detec-
tives meet to talk about
famous unsolved murders
the case always discussed is
one that the public knows little
about yet from a detectives point
of view this case is in a class by
itself-the most intriguing and ut-
terly bewildering mystery in the
history of the city

 the victim was isador fink a
laundryman whose business was con-
ducted by himself in a small front
room of a tenement at  east nd
street perhaps the fact that fink
was unknown and his murder so
baffling that there was not one clue
caused the newspapers to pay little
attention to it

  to the city police however the
case was and will always remain the
great unsolved classic in murders
only in fiction have the circum-
stances surrounding this murder
ever occurred before the whole
thing seems utterly impossible and
absurd yet what makes it so in-

triguing is the knowledge that some-
where is a simple and perfectly
natural answer to the enigma an
answer that detectives have over-
looked

 fink was young and unmarried
he worked hard and had few friends
and among his acquaintances he was
known as being somewhat eccentric
he always was possessed with the
fear that sometime he would be held
up and robbed and because of this
fear he kept the front door of his
laundry locked with a sliding bolt

  it was locked even in the daytime
when customers called he would
open the door a few inches and peer
out if he knew the caller he would
permit him or her to enter and when
the visitor had gone he would throw
the bolt back again

  behind the small laundry room a
room less than twenty feet square
was an apartment occupied by an
aged colored woman there was a
door leading from the laundry into
this rear apartment but it was bolted
murderers magic



and nailed and the lock was rusty
because the door hadnt been opened
for years

  there was only one window in the
laundry and this was covered with a
heavy bar grating the front door
was the only other egress from the
room and this was kept bolted day
and night above this was a small
transom barely large enough to let
a small child through

  at ten oclock on the night of
february   fink returned to
his laundry after making a delivery
to a customer several blocks away
the time was established later by the
police through an acquaintance who
saw fink returning

  it was a little after ten thirty that
same night when the aged negress
in the rear apartment heard screams
and curses in the fink laundry and
then followed two shots spaced a
few seconds apart and a third one
after a much longer interval

  the old woman ran out of her
apartment screaming for a police-
man a small crowd gathered around
her and patrolman george fineberg
appeared she babbled her fright-
ened story about the shots and the
anguished cries

  fineberg went to the front door of
the laundry and pounded on it only
a grim and oppressive silence greeted
his knocks he tried the door it
was locked from the inside there
was a light in the laundry and it
filtered through the small transom
over the front door

  after trying the door again and
knocking loudly fineberg went
back in the street and found a boy
small enough to slip through the
transom the boy had difficulty in
banging the transom open as fine-
berg held him up there but finally it
opened and the lad squirmed through
and dropped to the floor inside the
room

  he opened the door and fineberg
rushed jn he stopped very abruptly
a few steps inside the door
sprawled on the floor in the rear or
the small laundry room was fink
his head and shoulders in a pool oe
blood

  he was dead but the body was
still warm there were three
wounds in his body one in the
chest over the heart another in the
head and the third in his right arm

  detectives from the east th
street police station arrived at the
laundry a few minutes later patrol-
man fineberg had kept the crowd
back and had permitted nobody to
enter the death room

  the medical examiner came and
made an examination of the body of
fink he announced that death fol-
lowed almost instantaneously after
the bullet crashed into the dead
mans heart he found powder
marks near each of the wounds in-
dicating that the gun had been held
within six inches of the body when
fired

  meanwhile the detectives tried to
reconstruct the crime suicide was
the first theory but on questioning
the aged woman and learning that
she had heard the voices of two men
and that the third shot which was
undoubtedly the one that caused
death was fired after an interval
between it and the first two the sui-
cide theory was quickly abandoned

  a search of the laundry room
failed to uncover the gun and this
completely eliminated the suicide
theory examining the door leading
to the apartment of the colored
woman the detectives found it
nailed and the lock rusty and cob-
webs stretched over it

  the iron grating at the lone win-
dow prevented any person from en-
tering through it and the window
beyond this grating was covered


street  smiths detective story magazine

with dust and had not been opened

  patrolman fineberg told the de-
tectives that the front door had been
locked from the inside when he first
tried it the transom had only been
opened by the boy pounding hard on
it and knocking the paint away
showing that it had not been used for
years

  then suddenly the detectives real-
ized that they were faced with a
strange and baffling enigma how
did the murderer enter the room
how did he leave at first the full
import of these two baffling ques-
tions did not impress the detectives
but as the hours passed and the de-
tectives examined every inch of that
room and every board in the floor and
found no secret panels or hidden
doors the whole case became inex-
plicable

  the lock on the front door was
examined with the idea that fink
might have left it open and the
killer after committing his crime
had fled out of it and the door locked
itself when it was slammed shut

  but besides the regular lock was
a slip bolt and fineberg backed up
by the boy that had entered throgh
the transom stated that the bolt had
been slipped shut when the boy
dropped down into the room

another puzzling element in the
case was the fact that finks wallet

was in his coat pocket there wasnt
much money in it only a few dol-
lars but obviously the motive of the
murder was not robbery

  did the murderer fire through the
transom this theory was advanced
but the facts quickly ruled it out
the gun that fired the shots was
held within six inches of finks
body and his body lay fifteen feet
from the transom when found the
aged woman heard the voices of two
men inside the room and the tran-
som had obviously not been open for
years

  nine years have passed since the
strange murder of isador fink in
those nine years the enigma of his
death has intrigued every detective
on the force numerous theories
have been advanced as to where the
slayer stood how he gained admit-
tance to the laundry room and how
he made his houdini disappearance

  every phase of finks life has
been checked he was found to
have no enemies and few acquaint-
ances the fact that he always
bolted the door however indicates
that he feared for his life

  the police know that somewhere
there is a simple answer to the mys-
tery what is it they have
searched nine years for it and have
not found it

  can you find it

jails crowded

senologists estimating that the federal prison population will
increase fifteen to twenty per cent in the course of the year are

footsteps

by paul ellsworth triem

author of canceled life etc

     dderzook knew that the
sound wasnt real it was in-
side his mind-clump
clump clump the clubfeet
of little hunchbacked klauer stump-
ing along over floor or pavement

 then a time came when he had
to look round to convince himself
that klauer with his shaggy gray
hair and his bleary eyes wasnt back
there

 im a psychopathic type he
thought for he had been well edu-

cated im a hysteric-not the
kind that screams and kicks but
the kind that imagines things so hard
that they become real klauer isnt
walking along behind me hes
dead

  his hand went to his belt it
looked like an ordinary dress belt
but on the inner side just back of
the silver buckle was a zipper com-
partment stuffed with big bills that
was one way udderzook knew the
clubfooted shoemaker was dead the


street  smiths detective story magazine

------

money in the belt had been klauers

  just knowing that the footsteps
were imaginary didnt help the
sound of them grew more and more
convincing that was one thing ud-
derzook had never anticipated hed
planned the murder carefully as
far as headwork could make it fool-
proof he had cleared the way but
hed never thought of a splinter of
his own brain flying off on this tan-
gent

  udderzook tried for a time to ig-
nore those stumping steps then he
tried deliberately listening to them
they were growing louder and
louder as if klauer were coming
along a dark passage coming toward
the man who had killed him

  it will take more than phony foot-
steps to beat me he told himself
ill find some way of driving them
out of my mind

  he went one night into a cheap
eating place down below the dead-
line hed been hard up for a long
tine and had had to eat at such
paces part of his plan was to
ch ange none of his habits

  so he went into this place just
fter dark of a rainy evening there
were tables over at the left covered
with oilcloth and a counter with
round swivel stools in front of it

  udderzook walked over to the
counter he sat down on the stool
nearest the steam-filmed front win-
dow and directly afterward facing
him from the wall he saw his own
photograph

  it was on a sheet of paper about
ten by twelve inches in size and at
the bottom was the caption wanted
for murder

  beneath the halftone was a para-
graph in coarse type

for information leading to the arrest and
conviction of william udderzook whose
picture appears above the undersigned

will pay  wire phone or write
all information confidential

           signed

         john hanson

              administrator of the
              estate of abel klauer

  a yellow-haired waitress came
briskly along behind the counter

  what you eating to-night mis-
ter she asked

  william udderzook stared for a
moment at the greasy menu she
pushed toward him then despite his
fear and caution his eyes jerked back
to the poster

  the yellow-haired girl glanced
over her shoulder

  a guy came in about an hour ago
and stuck that up she said he
told me they were plastering the
state with them

  udderzook nodded stealthily he
examined her face she was yawn-
ing and looking indifferently away

  he ordered ham and eggs and sat
thinking he remembered early in
his acquaintance with klauer giving
the little shoemaker-at the latters
request-a snapshot of himself

  just to remember you by mine
friend klauer had explained with
his bleary grin i haf not many
friends always i keep this picture
where i can look at it

  but how had the law got hold of
it udderzook learned the answer
to this problem later in the evening
the newspaper which he took to his
shabby bedroom carried the story on
the front page he read

  at police headquarters a bulletin re-
porter learned that the homicide detail
has been in possession of a photograph
of the man suspected of murdering abel
klauer from very early in this baffling
case

  it was found under a rug on which
klauers body lay apparently he had
lived long enough to inscribe in shaky
letters on the back-and with his own
blood for ink-the name of the person
he accused but william udderzook if
footsteps



there really is such a person seems to
have vanished completely

  needless to say the offer of 
reward will spur every professional and
amateur detective in the country to
search for the missing man

  udderzook sat with the limp pa-
per sprawled across his knees so
klauer hadnt been quite dead
there had been life enough left in
his distorted little body to dig out
that snapshot from some inner
pocket and to paint the name of his
slayer on the back

  the whole state is plastered with
them udderzook muttered and his
lip began to jerk as if an invisible
fishhook were attached to it

  he stood up and examined himself
in the crinkled mirror of his dresser
the beard which he had allowed to
grow covered his face but he knew
it hadnt really disguised him not
only that but the beard itself-in
this day of shaven faces-would at-
tract the attention of every police-
man and detective in the country

  im sunk udderzook whispered

  he crouched down into his chair
and tried to think the chances
were that he was already under ob-
servation he had maintained two
rooms far apart in the city and had
checked out of the one where he
had lived before the murder and had
settled down here where he was
already known as karl mclean

  but ten thousand dollars was
enough money to quicken the eyes
of every man woman and child he
met that yellow-haired waitress
must have been as dumb as she
looked not to spot him

  for a long time his mind raced
like a clock that has lost its pen-
dulum he just sat shivering and
sweating and watching the febrile
thoughts race through his brain un-
able to check them then sheer fa-
tigue gripped him and he sank back

exhausted he groaned faintly

  the idea that came to him at last
was a bold one he would go to the
police-and tell them that he was
william udderzook he would ad-
mit having known klauer but would
deny any knowledge of how klauer
came by his death

  the only thing they have against
me is that blood-daubed snapshot
he thought if i try to hide theyll
find me-and ill look guilty if i
confront them of my own free will
theyll have to let me go

  it wasnt till next day when he
was on his way to police headquar-
ters that udderzook realized that
the footsteps had ceased shock had
driven them out of his mind-for-
ever he hoped

  he went along through the crisp
fall sunshine a policeman came to-
ward him swinging his club

  if he looks hard at me or stops
ill tell him who i am and that im
on my way to headquarters udder-
zook decided

  but the man in blue sauntered
past staring casually into udder-
zooks bearded face

  saphead william udderzook
muttered

  he turned into kearney street and
approached the concrete building
which was his objective he was
excited but determined hed seen
a rash of those wanted for mur-
der posters about town and he knew
this was the only way out

  he went up the steps and pushed
open a brass-bound door inside
the wide corridor he stared about
then spotted what he was looking
for over a door down the hall was
a sign chiefs office

  udderzook felt his knees giving
under him with each step but he
reached the door opened it and
pushed into the office beyond


street  smiths detective story magazine

  there was a high counter across
the room near the front behind it
at flat-topped desks three men in
blue uniforms sat writing or scowl-
ing down at piles of flimsies

  udderzook approached the coun-
ter and one of the policemen looked
up

  what dya want he growled

  i want to see the chief

  the other two policemen sat back
to listen

  ya got an appointment i sup-
pose the first said surlily

 no but-

  then be on your way roll your
hoop if ya got any squawk to
make go into the sergeants office
down front

  they all three sat eying william
udderzook disgustedly

  yer just one of them guys that
thinks the chiefs got nothing to do
but palaver a second of the trio
growled fly yer kite out of this
will ya

 william udderzook turned and
went toward the door the floor
seemed to be going up and down
like the deck of a ship in a storm
something-something immensely
important-was whispering to him
from the edge of his mind

  he went into the hall and stared
toward the front not one of those
men had recognized him nor had
the patrolman he met out in the sun-
light nor the waitress the evening
before

  they meet thousands of people
and im just one he realized that
snapshot probably doesnt look much
like me

  he saw the sign near the front
information the door was open
and behind brass grillework udder-
zook saw a husky red-faced man
writing in a big book

  out of a closed room across the
hall came a tall wide-shouldered

young fellow wearing a herringbone
suit and a snap-brimmed felt hat
he closed the door and stood staring
unpleasantly at udderzook

  well he said what do you
want got any business here

  udderzook knew that he was fac-
ing a detective and now he no
longer wanted to tell his story

  i-i came here to look for-for
a man he muttered

  a derisive grin came about the de-
tectives lips

  yeah i expect so well high-
tail out of this weve had enough
lugs hanging around-trying to
leave stink bombs in the phone
booths or maybe blow up the build-
ing beat it will you

  out in the street udderzook
wiped his face

  i nearly made a mistake he
thought no one is going to recog-
nize me all ive got to do is to keep
still my first plan was the best

  instinctively he listened for the
footsteps but they were gone he
ate breakfast and sat in the park
reading a paper he went home
toward night and lay on the bed
thinking

  those reward notices were just
one of the gestures the adminis-
trator of klauers estate was bound
to make plenty of innocent men
all over this part of the country
would be suspected and some of them
would be held for questioning

  you cant identify a man from a
snapshot udderzook realized

  in this sleepy rooming house there
was always a chance that some one
would ultimately suspect him
frowsy men and women were com-
ing and going at all hours they
were a suspicious breed

  ill move he thought

  for his next place of residence
he chose a room in an old-fashioned
footsteps



double house he chose it because
most of the rooms facing on the
street had room for rent signs
in the windows

  the building was old aifld decrepit
only the side with the room for
rent signs in the windows was
occupied

  udderzook routed out a rheumy-
eyed old woman from the basement
she hobbled up the stairs and along
a dark hall before him

 you can have your pick she
piped i aint got money enough
to fix em up nice and pretty and
theres too many rooms for rent in
this town anyhow youll have
things all to yourself

  udderzook chose a back room on
the second floor from the rear win-
dow he had a view over the hilly
section below he could see women
and children in tiny back yards
could see families eating in squalid
kitchens in the distance were va-
cant hillside lots with goats tethered
among the rubbish piles

 but this house was still-dead
still he could come and go as he
chose

  i wont get into the habit of stick-
ing in my room all day he resolved
im inclined to be psychopathic and
ive got to keep in the open as much
as i can

  so he used to leave early every
morning and not come back to his
room till night as he came up the
hill he could see the houses the
two sides of the double house appar-
ently peered with red eyes down at
him that was because the two
round windows in the adjacent doors
caught the red light of the setting
sun

  the days were growing shorter
fall was coming on and one night
returning after dark from a long
walk down the water front udder-

 ds-

zook again heard footsteps

  a thick brown fog had closed over
the town as he came up the hilly
street through it mysterious near
but invisible he could hear people
talking

  people going by him in the fog
then he seemed to pass into an area
of feltlike silence

  he was nearing the top of the hill
when he heard the steps-and this
time they were so distinct so out-
side of himself that he froze with
one foot ahead of the other and
looked slowly and fearfully back
over his shoulder

 they were coming uphill after
him-the stumpy steps of abel
klauers clubfeet no normal hu-
man being sounded like that and
this time they werent in his feverish
mind they were really coming to-
ward him through the fog

 nearer and nearer udderzook
felt sweat streaming down his face
and dripping from his chin he
stood for another moment then
whirled and was about to break into
a run the steps were so close that
in another instant he would see some-
thing horrible

  his feet seemed glued to the side-
walk he tugged at them and sud-
denly there burst from the fog not
the hunchbacked shoemaker but a
boy on stilts he came clattering up
the cobblestones his face hidden be-
hind a papier-mache mask

  its halloween udderzook real-
ized and felt the tension go out of
his muscles

  he walked slowly on home still
dazed by terror

  i hope that fright doesnt start
me to hearing things again he
thought

  he did hear noises during the eve-
ning troops of boys whooped
around the neighborhood torment-
ing householders till a police car


street  smiths detective story magazine

swooped down and grabbed some of
the offenders udderzook glancing
from time to time toward the black
mirror of his uncurtained window
heard the sounds of festivity gradu-
ally fade

  and he heard nothing else that
night or the following day slowly
he forgot the nervous shock he had
received

  but next night back in the silent
old house at the top of the hill he
heard the steps again hed been
reading and hed forgotten the time

  without warning he was jerked
out of his revery by a staccato vibra-
tion

  steps-quick hobbling coming up
the stairs coming straight for his
door-on the run

  udderzook dropped his book and
sprang erect

  his glaring eyes watched the door
the hobbling feet reached the land-
ing came along it

  he retreated to the window and
laid his hand on the sill his sur-
face mind had snapped out of gear
those footsteps were so horribly
distinct that he knew he was either
quite mad at last or that there was
something out there-something not
human something like abel klauer
come back from the other side of
death

 udderzook couldnt move he
leaned against the wall and his head
seemed drawn out of shape by the
effort to listen

  the steps had come along the
landing-toward his door-and after
that they just stopped

  whatever it was that had caused
them must be out there waiting

  ill never open the door udder-
zook whispered

  his teeth began to chatter as he
stood staring at the four battered
oak panels of the closed door he
seemed to see through it to see the

little shoemaker crouching out there
his shaggy gray head close to the
keyhole

  ill never open it he whispered
again-and began to creep toward
the door

  his terror had reached a point
where it drew him like a magnet to-
ward the thing he feared every-
thing was quiet-smotheringly quiet

  udderzook placed one numb foot
in front of the other his eyes were
stretched wide open his bared teeth
were clenched

  he came so close to the door that
he could touch it and stood holding
his breath was that-

  it came again-a babbling voice
something like that of a man with a
paralyzed tongue and palate trying
to laugh

  that was too much udderzooks
hand lashed out seized the door-
knob jerked open the door

  but the space outside-the land-
ing and hall-was empty

  he managed to close the door he
lurched back to his chair and fell
into it for a time he was only
partly conscious

  he got up later and went to bed
he was numb and stricken from his
experience morning came and he
lay trying to think there had been
a horrible objectivity about what he
had heard

  all that day it lingered in his
mind evidently his sick brain was
much worse never in all his
previous years had he heard any-
thing like this his hallucinations
had always been of thinner stuff than
reality but those footsteps were
more real than life

 he considered making another
move but as night came on he
headed back for the old house

  if i start to run from it ill be
chased to my grave he realized
    its true love

when it lastsforyears

when a feller wins the right gal he
dont go blind but if hes smart
the only wandering he does is with his
eyes    and not too much o that

its kind o like that between a man and

i might have escaped the police
even if they had recognized me but
id be taking this thing right with
me ive got to conquer it-here

  he let himself in and stood listen-
ing everything was still he went
slowly up the stairs testing each
step frowning down at them

  it must have been an echo from
the street he thought but he knew
better

  that night he couldnt read al-
though he tried to he kept look-
ing up over his book at the door
which he sat facing his sleep of
the night before hadnt rested him
but he was afraid to turn out the
light

  i shant go to bed till im sure it
wont come again he whispered-
and at that moment he heard foot-
steps coming up the stairs

  clump clump clump

  up they came hurried purposeful
-the steps of klauer coming up-
stairs toward udderzooks room

  again he found himself standing
his whole body dripping with sweat
his eyes distended he backed to-
ward the window-then with a chok-
ing cry sprang forward

  this time hed hurl the door open
while the steps could still be heard
if klauer was out there hed con-
front him

  he got across the floor and laid
hold of the knob it slipped through
his wet fingers he gritted his teeth
and twisted

  clump clump clump

  those fearful steps were near the
top of the stairs-were just outside
on the landing

  udderzook slowly drew the door
open he stood clinging to it star-
ing into the unlighted hall he could
still hear steps but there was no one
here

  then like the blow of a hammer an
idea came to him this was a double

house the other side was sup-
posed to be vacant but whatever was
making those ghostly footsteps was
over there

  the sound had ceased udderzook
turned and tried to draw his door
shut

  im imagining the whole thing-
now that ive faced it here it pre-
tends to come from beyond the par-
tition he whispered

  suddenly he turned back into the
hall descending the worn treads
with fumbling feet and weak knees
he reached the street door and went
out upon the porch

  there was a division here between
the two sides of the old house a
dark space ran straight down to the
concrete floor of the areaway but
udderzook leaned over and peered
at the windows the-e was no light
dust had made them grimy and
almost opaque

  he threw one leg over the iron
rail of his little porch stepped across
the areaway and stood facing that
other closed door he tried the han-
dle and found that it was unlocked

  udderzook went in but he left the
door open evidently this house
was a counterpart of the one he
lived in

  light from the street shone up
the stairs udderzook stood looking
up

  then he walked slowly forward
and began to climb he kept look-
ing up and listening everything
was still

  ill chase you out of here he
said ill confront you and turn
you into what you started from-
nothing

  he reached the second-story land-
ing and stopped no sound noth-
ing but the swell and thud of his own
heart

  the hall stretched away toward
the foot of another staircase which
footsteps



led to the third floor udderzook
laid his hand on the dusty railing and
felt his way slowly back-or for-
ward for he was now facing the
street

  he had approached to within six
steps of the foot of the staircase
when suddenly he heard the steps
they came from the top floor and
they seemed to be hopping about in
a grotesque dance

  and now they were coming down

  clump clump clump

  as real as his own shaking body
as real as his thick protesting voice
his words tumbled out without
meaning-and were answered

  that paralyzed babbling laughter
drove him to frenzy so klauer had
sounded when he lay dying he
had tried to talk and the blood well-
ing from his throat had choked him

  udderzook stood for another in-
stant his heart bursting his brain
seared and shriveling then he
whirled and ran

  down the front stairs-tripping
madly catching himself by the ban-
ister leaping on down through
the open front door

  his clammy hand gripped the iron
railing he leaped galvanically up
and over his hand slipped and he
pitched head downward into the

dark there sounded a crunching
smash

  udderzook lying on the cold con-
crete wasnt quite dead for he saw
the policeman who came running
down the steps but his eyes opened
and closed like those of a decapi-
tated rooster

 something was coming down the
steps-out of the other half of the
old house where he had lived

  and lying there dying udder-
zook understood it was only one
of the neighborhood goats caught
by some mischievous youngsters on
halloween and shut up in the vacant
half of the old house

  only a goat shaking its head frac-
tiously now as it stood looking down
into the areaway

  youre hurt bad sor the police-
man said did ye slip

  udderzook looked up but his eyes
were filming

  can you hear me the policeman
asked and can ye give me your
name

  udderzooks lips moved he was
trying to say im the man who is
wanted for murder

  but the policeman had vanished in
a great gray cloud and udderzook
felt himself being whirled away into
starless space perhaps into noth-
ingness

hours after he had
broken his date with the
hangman trigger haines
was only twenty miles from
cole county prison where in the
jail yard a scaffold had been espe-
cially built to receive him

 trigger was lucky to have got
even twenty miles with pursuit so
hard upon his heels it would have
been folly to keep to his original
plan of trying for a get-away in the
automobile that tessie had left for
him at the foot of west street the
ignition key hidden under the floor
mat

  all highways were blocked all
cars being stopped and searched
within twenty minutes after haines
had shot his way out of the death
cell a dark night and the confusion
of a violent rainstorm had enabled
him to take flight across the open
country and so far slip through the
net

  daylight was danger as the first
graying of dawn began to melt the
nights shielding blackness trigger
haines knew that his only chance
now was to get under cover-and
stay there until darkness came
again

 the rain had stopped but his

denim trousers and jacket which he
had been forced to wear in jail hung
soddenly to his short squat body
the chill of their clammy touch
soaked through his skin until the
very marrow of his bones was ice
mud caked his shoes and weighted
his feet almost completely ex-
hausted he emerged from a strip of
woods into a small cleared field

  just ahead was a small collection
of buildings dimly silhouetted
against a background of dirty gray
sky breath pumping through his
throat in wheezing gasps trigger
haines paused leaning against the
sagging fence which inclosed the
small meadow carefully he took
stock of his surroundings

  his flight made with a confused
sense of direction had evidently
brought him into the outskirts of a
small town the buildings appar-
ently belonged to a village farm
where a family kept a cow and a
few chickens but the place had a
run-down deserted atmosphere
which was noticeable even in the
darkness

  daylight soon muttered trig-
ger haines gotta get under cover
somewhere cant keep goin much
longer anyhow

wearily he crawled through the
fence and made his way through the
cops wife



wet tangle of uncut meadow grass to
investigate the buildings and deter-
mine how safe it would be for him
to use one of them as a hide-away
he reached the barn and found a
door that he could open cau-
tiously he struck a match shielding
the flame within cupped hands

 the barn was empty evidently
it had been in disuse for a long time
there was still hay in the loft he
could see that through the opening
above the stalls and the ladder lead-
ing up to the space under the eaves
the hay would be warm he could
burrow into the stuff and get some
heat into his shivering body

  trigger haines climbed the lad-
der and dug himself in slowly
very slowly a little warmth began
to creep back into his blood the
promise of daylight became an
actuality as the sun crept up over the
horizon and shot beams of light
through cracks in the barn wall

  suddenly just as the idea of sleep
began to take hold of him he heard
a sound which startled him fully
awake again a door had banged
there was the rattle of an empty tin
pail alarmed trigger haines
squirmed his head and shoulders out
of the hay and put his eye near one
of the cracks which gave him a view
of the rear of the house

 a woman had come out of the
kitchen she was young and pretty
and the gracefulness of her body
was a poetry of motion

  trigger haines wasnt interested
in her beauty he saw only that she
was headed toward the barn and his
heavy vicious face twisted into an
ugly snarl as his right hand-the
one with the first joint of the thumb
missing-moved toward his gun
jerking it clear of the crudely im-
provised holster which held it under
his armpit

  the other hand darted toward the

sagging pocket of his cotton prison
jacket heavy with the cylindrical
weight of a silencer swiftly he
fitted the silencer to the end of the
gun muzzle then he saw that these
deadly preparations were at least
for the moment unnecessary

  the comely young woman wasnt
coming to the barn after all she
was making her way to the well a
moment later the pump was creak-
ing plaintively as she drew a pail of
water trigger haines gave a grunt
as he relaxed and he was preparing
to crawl back under the hay when
his hand again tightened its grip on
the gun

  the staccato putt-putt of a motor
cycle beat loudly on the morning
air topping a small hill the speed-
ing machine came roaring down the
gray sweep of concrete highway
suddenly opening up its siren

 when he heard that trigger
haines didnt need to see the state
troopers uniform to know it was a
police motor cycle

  at the well the pretty young
woman put down the water bucket
and waved her hand the motor
cycle slackened speed turned off the
highway and into the path which
led up to the shabby house it did
not stop until state trooper fowler
braked to a halt beside the kitchen
door

  trigger haines watched warily
his eyes squeezed almost shut a
deadly light glittering through the
fleshy slits and his fingers tightened
about the butt of the gun

  o k copper get off your bike
and have a look around he said
under his breath youre pickin
the quickest way i know of gettin
yourself a ticket straight to hell

  state trooper fowler didnt have
his mind on the man hunt which had
kept the police on the jump through

the night he was not as trigger
haines supposed carrying out or-
ders to search all buildings up and
down the highway

 bert fowler was grinning as he
pushed up his goggles shut off the
engine and parked his machine

  good morning mrs fowler he
sang out

 and good morning to you mr
fowler the girl at the well an-
swered him with a happy laugh
arent you getting through a little
early this morning

  bert fowler drew off his gaunt-
lets walked over to the well and
kissed her they had been married
exactly one month and two days

  got to check in at headquarters
before i can officially call it a night
bert told her they pulled me off
my regular patrol to join in the man
hunt guess maybe you heard trig-
ger haines crashed out of jail last
night

 milly fowler nodded yes i
heard it over the radio have they
caught him yet

 bert shook his head nope
looks like he was smart enough to
stay off the highways some of the
boys think hes got away clean but
i believe hes crawled in somewhere
and will try to keep under cover
until the search wears itself out

 somebody must have been ter-
ribly careless-to let a gun be smug-
gled into a condemned man said
milly

  that was done pretty smart ex-
plained bert trigger haines has
got a girl a tough moll by the name
of tessie the cops over at ben-
sonville picked her up last night and
put on the pressure

  triggers cell was on the second
floor of the county prison and it
had an outside window as these
dinky local jails are likely to have
well this tessie wasnt fool enough
to try and smuggle in the gun she
knew she couldnt get away with
that

youre wondering how that hooks

  well listen-this is good that

terial-strong silk cord trigger
haines unraveled it and he had a
stout string long enough to reach
the street

  he drops it out the window
tessie is waiting down there with
the gun she ties it onto the end of
the string and trigger hauls it up
into his cell

  a gun with a silencer on it mind
you thats how he could kill
charley fay who was on the death
watch without the shot being heard
in the front office

  fay and trigger were playing
checkers through the locked cell

 bert walked back to his motor

swung the machine around kicked
the motor to life and went zooming
down the highway

 up in the haymow trigger spat
out a string of muffled profanities

snarled under his breath and i
dasnt stir outta here until it gets
night again i gotta stay put and

 the muttered words mumbled to
an open-mouthed pause as his nar-
row-set eyes popped wide with the
impact of a sudden idea the cun-
ning brain which had concocted the
clever scheme of the gun and the
knitted necktie had leaped to still
another triumph of ingenuity

 ah he breathed maybe it
aint such a bad break after all

  trigger hainess scheme began to
take on form he was thinking
aloud as he swiftly arranged the de-
tails

 yeah thats one way to get
clear-maybe the only way the

she heard the rear kitchen door
open and was a little bewildered
that bert could have got back so
soon or that he could have arrived
without her hearing his motor cycle
as she swung around from the
kitchen sink-the one which was
soon to be equipped with running
water-a strangled cry arose and
clogged in her throat and the stir-
ring spoon slipped from her hand
clattering on the floor

 this short squat man with the
evil face and narrow-set beady eyes
-she knew it was trigger haines
the denim trousers and jacket the
gun in his hand with the knobbed
protuberance at the end of the bar-
rel told her beyond any possible
doubt

  if you start yappin trigger
haines warned her ill have to
shut you up

 i mustnt let myself scream
milly fowler thought hell kill
me if i do no i mustnt let myself
scream

  she stood with the fingers of both
hands pressed tightly across her
mouth staring at him what did he
want clothes money food

 trigger haines moved closer to
the kitchen stove the heat felt
good but there wasnt enough of it
to suit him keeping the gun
pointed at the cops wife he jerked
one of the lids from the firebox
jammed in three fresh sticks of
wood then he opened the dampers
kicked open the oven door and
pulled up a chair to soak up all the
warmth he could

  milly fowler found the use of her
voice

  you-youd better get out of here
as quick as you can she told him
my husband is a state trooper
hell be back almost any minute

  trigger haines leered knowingly
sure his names fowler and hes

a dread whisper what-what do
you mean

  trigger haines thought himself a
very clever fellow and in his swag-
gering conceit he could not resist
the impulse to boast how clever he
really was grinning spaciously he
rested the knobby end of the gun
muzzle against his knee

  why i got an idea that id try
to make a little trade with your cop
husband lady his uniform and the
motor bike-i got use for em
maybe ill trade him a nice bullet
for em-if he gets foolish ideas
about bein a hero

  the walls of the kitchen swung
crazily in front of millys eyes
trigger hainess hard evil face be-
came an almost indistinguishable
blur as she realized what was going
to happen she saw it as clearly as
if it already had happened

  it wouldnt be that bert wanted to
make himself a hero but he would
try to do his duty a cops duty is
to have courage

  therell be shooting therell be
killing thought milly bert wont
have a chance he wont be expect-
ing anything like this

 then trigger hainess harsh
voice was saying and while were
waitin what about gettin me some
chow some bacon and eggs-thatll
be quickest

  milly fowlers brain cleared a lit-
tle but her mind still had a numb
dead feeling as she acquiesced to his
suggestion about bacon and eggs

  what am i to do she thought
desperately ive got to do some-
thing i cant let bert walk into a
trap like this i cant let bert be
shot down without a chance
there was no telephone in the
house but what difference did that
make trigger haines wouldnt
give her a chance to use it anyhow

self then when haines fires his
gun bert will know-

  but that was no good either trig-
ger hainess gun had a silencer on
it there would be no explosion to
warn bert if she screamed that
would only bring her husband a few
seconds more quickly-straight into
a death trap from which there was
no possible escape

  the eggs and the bacon were done
milly dished them onto a plate
trigger haines reached out one of
his dirty paws and pulled the
kitchen table across the floor so that
he could still revel in the heat of
the stove he kept one hand on his
gun

  what about coffee he growled

  milly moistened her lips i-

i	forgot about the coffee she stam-
mered

  youre a hell of a cook rasped
trigger haines fix me some
coffee

  milly fowler turned around to the
kitchen sink and reached to the shelf
above it where the coffeepot was her
fingers froze rigidly about the han-
dle as her ears caught the sound-
the shriek of the siren on berts
motor cycle he always signaled
her like that when he was nearing
home she had formed the habit of
measuring the time which elapsed
between the wail of the siren and

kitchen door after a last dramatic
racing of the engine usually it
took just about two minutes

 and then she saw a chance-just
one possible chance how the idea
came to her what had inspired it
she did not know it just leaped
into her mind-and there it was

  triggers eyes never left her even
for an instant he saw her take the
lid from the coffeepot pour in sev-
eral heaping tablespoons of coffee
from the coffee can he saw her fill
it from an earthenware jug

  he wondered a little absently
why a good-looking jane like this
would want to marry a cop and live
in a run-down house where she had
to carry water from out-of-doors

 she must be dumb as hell
thought trigger a doll with her
looks could write her own ticket

  for just an instant he had a mo-
ment of regret that he was going to
have to kill her but of course
that was necessary he didnt dare
leave her behind alive to send pur-
suit racing after him

 milly fowler turned away from
the sink and stepped over to the
hot stove the lids glowed red
from the heat of the extra fuel trig-
ger haines had put in the firebox
lifting a lid she set the coffeepot
directly over the flames

  it-it ought to percolate in just
-just a minute said milly and
withdrew to the far corner of the
kitchen her eyes had a bright set
look and she seemed to be holding
her breath

  again bert fowlers motor cycle
screamed raucously-closer this
time so close that now milly could
hear the explosive spitting of the
motor closer closer

  her eyes were fixed upon the cof-
feepot and the red-hot glow of the
stove upon which it rested her
lips moved mutely she was praying
silently-that the thing that must
happen would happen in time

cops wife



  berts motor cycle had turned into
the driveway she heard it slacken
pace heard the tires make their
crunching sound on the spot where
there were gravel and ashes just
outside the kitchen door trigger
hainess body straightened his eyes
glistened with a malevolent enjoy-
ment he hated cops all cops kill-
ing them was a pleasure the gun
lifted in his hand

  then without warning a sheet of
flame filled the room as the coffeepot
exploded with a dull roar blazing
liquid shot toward the ceiling de-
scended in a spatter of fire

  trigger haines got a lot of it over
his head on his shoulders with a
scream of agony he dropped the gun
and started beating out the flames
with his bare hands the room be-
came pungent with the smell of
burned hair

  damn you he shouted what
did you put in that coffeepot

  the gun had struck the floor and
slid five or six feet away from him
milly fowler made a leap for the
weapon scooped it up in her hand

  kerosene she said stay where
you are ive got the gun

  by something of a miracle trig-
ger haines had not been blinded
he made a lunge toward her

  gimme that gat he said between
his teeth

  millys finger found the trigger
she squeezed it-hard a pinging
sound a little spurt of yellowish
fire and trigger haines reeled back
his blistered hands clawing at his
chest-a wound not quite low
enough to keep them from hanging
him

  i mustnt faint i mustnt faint
milly kept telling herself a cops
wife doesnt faint

 she was still standing very
straight with the gun almost steady
in her hand as trooper fowler
flung open the kitchen door and
pounded into the room
