   we would greatly appreciate any informa-

   reply by victor shaw 

   the vulture range and gold mine are some
  miles to the southwest of wickenburg by
 road and this range tends northeast and south-
 west yougo  miles west of wickenburg
 on us-- to a dirt road on your left that
 runs southwesterly along the eastern side of
 this range the old vulture mine is on this
 eastern side too

   as for the big horn mts my latest map
 shows it to lie farther southwest of the vulture
 range about - miles which means theyre
 in plain sight from the vultures this range
 tends northivest and southeast near the west
 boundary of maricopa county at their north-
 western end they nearly join the harquahala
 mts and may be a spur from the latter range
 all this region is a sage desert

  ive been past the vultures and wickenburg

hell on wheels

by bart cassidy

even when old cheyenne tvas a real man for breakfast town the
classic feud between jed mink and pike welch created gun-smoke

history

cheyenne became the hell on
wheels town in the fall of 
and it was a foregone conclusion
that either jed mink or pike welch-or
both-would be too dead to celebrate the
meeting of the transcontinental  railway
tracks which were bound to meet in the near
future that one man would kill the other
even before the next end-of-track point
would be reached was not doubted by any
of the track-layers gamblers saloon keep-
ers or general camp followers who made up
the main but very temporary population of
one terminus settlement after another as
the union pacific thrust its steel ribbons
farther and farther into the west the dead-
ly feud between mink and welch was fast
reaching a definite breaking point but
what the payoff would be and who would
kill whom were moot questions you could
get an even bet any way you wanted it

  the bad feeling between jed mink and
pike welch started in a friendly poker
game at that time the terminal point was
north platte nebraska mink happened to
produce an extra and convenient ace at the
wrong time and welch took exception to
the play and cracked him over the head
with a broken beer bottle mink retaliated
with a quick knife thrust that grazed
welchs cheek   

  the two adversaries were quickly called
to account for their seemingly rowdy con-
duct by the section superintendent in north
platte weve got enough trouble as it is
with this floatin population the superin-
tendent pointed out without you two sec-
tion hand foremen settin a bad example to
the men its up to you to stop fights and
such-not to start em remember youre
leaders of men as far as the union pacific
is concerned behave yourselves

  the pair of chastened foremen saw the
light but only for a short time

  in julesburg colorado mink once again

came up with an unaccounted for ace in a
delicate game then with fists and knives
the two men had a set-to that lasted for an
hour spectators called it a draw and
cheered wildly

  but it was in cheyenne that the two
leaders of men had a gunfight on the
main street it was bloody but far from
fatal for either mink or welch however
it now became apparent to all that one man
or the other did not have much longer to
live they had already indulged in three
battles each worse than the previous one
but all had ended on an even score fate
was being tempted too far

  suddenly the betting started big tim
malloy proprietor of a highly portable sa-
loon became stake holder for hundreds of
bets at even money supporters of the
opponents were laying heavy wagers on
their favorite it was a case of betting on
which of the two quarrelsome foremen got
buried in the boneyard-as end-of-track
cemeteries were called-first

  on placing a bet with stakeholder malloy
the regular procedure was to lay your
money on the line and say fifty dollars
that mink gets in the boneyard first or
ten clams that welch makes the boneyard
before mink does

  malloy a happy and prosperous business
man merely deducted five percent of all
monies as his fee personally he didnt
care which killed which or who made the
boneyard first the feud was making him
anespecially rich man soon he figured
he could retire from this hectic railroad
building riot of a life take his profits from
saloon and stakeholdingand retire to the
quiet of the east malloy although avid to
take their money for the rankest of whiskey
always felt himself far above the railroad
workers their foremen and other denizens
of the floating town end-of-the-track

no matter where it happened to be he was
merely out to get some quick money and
let the boneyards fill up as they may he
had nothing but contempt for railroad build-

earned to him a tracklayer was the lowest
form of humanity except when he paid an
exorbitant price for a drink of malloys

stakeholder as he had proved many times

last long jed mink armed with a  and
getting weary of the whole business settled
the matter by shooting to death the un-
armed pike welch the fact that there had
been bad blood between the two for so long
made it necessary for a hastily summoned
coroners jury to decide it was a matter of
self-defense- hell on wheels was a broad-
minded place at all times

  that evening as the dead mike welchs
friends made arrangements for a fine funer-
al the next rporning jed minks faction
happily collected their bet winnings from
the stakeholder big tim malloy he cheer-
fully paid out approximately -after
deducting his legitimate fee-to the lucky
ones who had bet that welch would wind
up in the boneyard before mink did

  the following morning a sunday gave
the defunct foremans friends a chance to
give their champion a fitting burial acquir-
ing for the purpose a two-wheeled cart
drawn by a mule from the local butcher
the mourners placed the body in a long box
and placed it on the cart

  while one of the number went to find
some rope to make fast the coffin for its
ride through some mountainous country to
the towns boneyard a few miles away the
other mourners repaired into big tim mal-
loys saloon to drown part of their sorrow
at losing both their bets and their friend
as the rope procurer was gone quite a
while the burial party got fairly well or-
ganized orations were made and toast
after toast was offered in memory of mike
welch

  the mule left free at the hitchrack
got tired of waiting pulling his macabre
burden he slowly ambled off toward the
hills two hours elapsed before the mourn-

ers realized that the cart with its coffin
was missing and what was the sense of
going to the boneyard if you had nothing to
bury  joined by the rope getter who finally
came back minus a rope the party resumed
their drinking in touching tribute to the
departed friend who had now departed in
more ways than one

evening bad arrived then darkness
by the time anybody thought it might
be fittin to go out and look for the mule
the cart and welch

  a quick check with the mules owner in-
formed them that the beast had returned to
its home a few hours before sundown pull-
ing the cart but definitely minus the long
box containing the deceased foreman

  now if you was a mule asked one
puzzled mourner of another after the group
had once again gathered at malloys bar
what would you do if you wanted to get
rid of a coffin on a cart hitched to you

  dont rightly know came the answer
lets ask slim loper hes more like a
mule than any of the rest of us

  when asked the weighty question slim
loper allowed as how he would pull the
burden up the mountain road until he came
to a spot where the unfastened coffin would
just slide off and down into a deep gully
under its own xwer then hed head for
the home barn

  when it was proved the following morn-
ing that slims mule-like thinking was cor-
rect-the long box lid partly off had been
sighted from the road by an early rising
farmer on his way into town with produce
slim modestly disclaimed any credit
hell he said any fool jackass wouldve
thought of that

  pike welchs friends decided to let the
body rest in the deep gully until the follow-
ing sunday-the best day for a nice funeral
so long as welch had to go to the bone-
yard he might as well wait until the thing
could be done up proper-like

  the demise of pike welch left a void in
the daily and nightly life of bis killer jed
mink becoming bored jed found it neces-
sary to pick someone else with which to
quarrel he made the slight error of pick-
ing on a man who was very quick and handy
with a knife by the time mirk learned of
his mistake he was dead the dire and fatal
result of a jagged opening in his throat

ride with the
 gunsmoke judas

by
thomas thompson

 to everyone but chet w ainsworth gunther was the greatest leader
 the nesters ever had but chet knew that both he and the sodbusters
 could expect more mercy from the cattlemens guns than from the
 deadly friendship of their champion

to look at them no man could guess
that they had started as farmers
they were bearded and dirty armed
with knife and gun and rope and one of
them always stood near the camp on guard
ready to kill if need be they were wanted
in a dozen places and they were welcome
in a hundred scattered dugouts and soddies

  the leader of the band les gunther
leaned back on his elbows with a grass straw
in his mouth and his lizard eyes looked
across the shimmering heat waves of the val-
ley he was a long thin man with an angu-
lar jaw the knots of his knuckles the only


remaining sign of the years he had spent
grubbing in worthless soil that had never
raised a crop his wife had left him for a
man with money there was a hideous scar
on his neck where a cattleman had burned
him with a rope thats it chet he said
quietly looking out across the valley
heres revenge finally and along with it
a home for a lot of good people-and were
the ones that will get it for em

  the man called chet was young like
the others he was bearded and dirty and
had the furtive look of a hunted man about
him but there was also rebellion in his pale



fifteen western tales

blue eyes he laughed shortly youre be-
ginning to believe it arent you les he
said

  anger was like a drawn curtain across
les gunthers eyes you forgetting he
said

  not likely chet wainsworth said

  dont ever gunther said its pete
bryan that claims that valley does that
mean anything to you

  chet wainworth stood up he was tall
and well built and the grace of his move-
ments betrayed his youth i said i remem-
bered didnt i he said he walked off into
an oak thicket passing the four men
stretched out in the new grass coming at
last to the lookout stationed in a nest of
rocks at the crest of the knoll well chet
said

  tonight the lookout said his voice
was the voice of an old man and there was
a sprinkle of gray in his whiskers the
cowboys will be out at the ranch we can
ride in and take over the town and come
morning the wagons will be in the valley
and the claims will be staked out

  then comes the slaughter chet said
but we wont be there to see it

  whats the matter boy the old man
said quietly

  maybe im tired chet wainsworth
said or maybe im sick of lying to my-
self

  were giving the folks in that wagon
train a chance the old man said thats
good land down there free land they
got a right to it

  funny how convincing a man can get
when he decides to become a saviour chet
said les has even convinced you

  you better get some rest chet the old
man said

  chet shook his head and a tired grin lift-
ed one corner of his mouth maybe i bet-
ter get -some sense he said

he hadnt heard les gunther come
up behind him he turned and les
was standing there that lazy loose jointed
slouch making him look half asleep he
was grinning thats a good thought
chet les gunther said a little sense
wouldnt fiurt you gunther straightened
suddenly general meeting all hands he
said he snapped the order like an army
officer

  another month of this and youll expect
us to call you sir chet thought disgusted-
ly he followed along with nate williams
the lookout and presently the other four
members of the gang joined them under an
oak tree les gunther took his jlace in
front of them ramrod straight now his
hands laced behind his back he paced back
and forth his eyes on the ground while the
men waited tolerant half-grins on their
bearded faces

  men gunther said finally down there
is the free land we promised these settlers
they paid us to bring them here and we
havent failed em theres a cowman by
the name of pete bryan claims that valley
he paused dramatically i know that
name means something different to every
one of you but to all of us it means land
grabbing pete bryan wont like us moving
into his valley gunthers voice took on a-
deeper tone theres women and kids de-
pending on us men the law will call us
raiders and even killers but god is on our
side dont ever forget that even when things
go against us

  chet wainsworth felt disgusted he had
come from a deeply religious family and it
was this sacrilege that had first driven him
to examine les gunthers real motives he
knew now what les gunther was after and
there was nothing noble about it they
would ride down into that valley to plunder
and steal anything they could get their hands
on beyond the hill a dozen wagons waited
farm people who had been driven from their
land and who now followed the shadowy fig-
ure of les gunther and his raiders in blind
faith by morning those wagons would be
in the valley men and women would be
kneeling in prayer blessing the name of les
gunther and by nightfall those farmers
would be lucky if they were alive

  chet didnt listen to the rest of gun-
thers speech he had heard it a dozen times-
it was the only salve gunther ever used on
his conscience

  les gunther had been a self-styled preach-
er in the kansas cooperative community
that had once been home to the men in this
band he had a persuasive way of talking
and after that bloody night when every
building and nearly half the members of the
community had been wiped out revenge had
been an easy commodity to sell chet
wainworth only nineteen had buried his
ride with the gunsmoke judas



parents and joined up with gunthers raid-
ers

  at first there were more than fifty men in
the band an outfit pledged to land reforms
and justice for the nesters who were spill-
ing west in ever increasing numbers lured
by the homestead act and the cheap rail-
road land the national grange was just
starting to form les gunther called himself
its enforcement arm one -by one though
the members of the band dropped out as
they saw gunther bloat with his own im-
portance but they still supported him in his
reign of blood and violence in a few the
seed of hatred and revenge was too strong
so they remained with the band and with the
others the chance for plunder was the only
motive for remaining chet looked at the
men knowing them well old nate williams
metzger there by the tree cluny breck-
inridge kraft and himself

  it was the end of the trail and chet knew
it of the remaining band chet was the
only one not wanted for crimes that had
nothing whatsoever to do with land reforms
this was an outlaw band now different
from others only in that it could find sanc-
tuary in the homes of farmers for les
gunther knew a good thing when he saw it
he had never let the farmers forget that he
was a martyr to a cause hunted because he
had fought for farmers rights chet looked
at les gunther now seeing the hypocrisy in
the man and hating him for it he saw
gunther turn his head and open his shirt
exposing the scar of the rope burn once
the sight of that lynch noose had fired chet
wainworth to the point of blindness now
it disgusted him for he knew that like ev-
erything else les gunther did this too was i
a pose 

  this land is open to homestead les
gunther said youve seen the maps and
you know its so once we get our claims
staked there aint no law can put us off ex-
cept the kind of law you carry in a holster
and pete bryan himself taught us how to
handle that kind of law

  were finally going to fight then are
we chet said he saw nate williams
glance at him nervously he saw the quick
anger in les gunthers eyes

  were claiming homes for them that
need homes les gunther said were al-
ways ready -to fight for the rights of our
own folks

  youve said it so damn often you believe
it yourself chet said

  gunthers anger came to full flame the
other men avoided chets eyes theres
something on your mind chet gunther
said quietly you better get it off your
chest

  all right chet said i will im sick of
your speeches thats all i joined up with
you because a cowman killed my mother and
because i figured folks like my folks wasnt
getting a square deal

  the rest of us are here for the same rea-
sons chet gunther said convincinly

  chet laughed harshly look gunther
he said if were gonna rob the bank in
that town and loot the stores lets do it but
lets dont make out like we got guts enough
to fight pete bryan because we havent and
lets dont drag a bunch of farmers down
there with us and then leave em there to
fight it out alone

all the slackness was back in les gun-
thers frame those lizard eyes of his
came veiled and smoky his voice was a
lazy drawl ive never stopped a man from
quitting if he was of a mind to quit he
said i reckon you can find your horse
cant you

  damned easy chet said and i can
protect my back too he turned and
walked rapidly away

  there was tenseness in his muscles and
he had trouble with ljis hands when he sad-
dled his horse he saw nate williams com-
ing toward him and he busied himself with
the cinch trying to avoid nates eyes
dont do it boy nate said quietly
ive got to nate cht said

  even if you get out of this camp alive
nate said youll be dead inside a week
if the law dont get you right off some cat-
tleman will the nesters wont cover up for
you soons they find out you quit les gun-
ther gunther is like a god to em the old
man laid his hand on the boys arm weve
gone too far son he said- kindly there
aint no turning back once youve gone as
far as weve gone

  then go ahead chet said savagely
but dont pull a bunch of dirt farmers into
it with you go down there and loot and
burn the town but tell those farmers to turn
back tell em you made a mistake bring-
ing em here tell em the land aint open


jrlklfcen western tales

he clamped his jaws and spoke through his
teeth or tell em les gunther aint got
the guts to face pete bryan

   nates old eyes softened and it was as if
he were seeing things a long time gone
would it be because of lorraine petti-
grew he asked

   chets blustering denial betrayed him
shes a pretty little thing nate said
i jioticed you talking to her a lot the last
week or so when we was bringing the folks
out here his eyes clouded maybe i
dont blame you he said but ive come to
think of my own skin first gunthers crazy
on a lot of things i know but hes right
when he says we cant afford to have a man
quit the band nates eyes turned hard
and he gave chet a fiat stare i agree with
him there chet

   not you nate chet said softly he
reached down and took old nates hand
briefly and for a moment he felt a strong
companionship remembering the days when
this band had started out with such high
ideals and purposes let one of the others
do it

   nate williams clung to the boys hand
id watch myself there at the end of the
canyon if i was you he whispered thats
where id lay for you if i had to do the
job

   thanks chet said briefly he touched
his spurs and rode across the grassy ridge
and into the canyon that led to the tiny val-
ley where a dozen wagorts were drawn up in
a tight camp awaiting the signal to pull
across the ridge and claim land they could
call their own they waited there know-
ing there was trouble ahead willing to face
it because they were following les gunther
and his raiders secure in the knowledge that
les gunther and his men would help them
fight for their rights -
but les gunther wasnt going to fight
he would use the invasion of the nesters as
a cover-up for his own operations and when
the shooting started les gunther and his
raiders would be long gone

   chet thought of the nesters people who
were like his owri people you fools he
aid softly damn blind fools all of you
but my kind of fools

  he rode into the canyon and now he
had a rifle in his hand he had seen men try
to quit les gunthers band before he had
helped bury three of them

forewarned by old nate chet rode
cautiously alert to every movement in
the rocky canyon ahead of him he started
once when a ground squirrel skittered across
the trail straining his ears intently to hear
above the sound of his horses hooves

  somewhere there ahead of him a man who
had been a saddle mate was waiting now to
kill him it would be breckinridge chet fig-
ured he had always liked breckinridge he
felt no real malice toward him now breck-
inridge was a tool just as a rifle was a tool
the crime of murder if murder was a crime
rested on the shoulders of les gunther a
man who had started with a shining dream
and then twisted that dream to fit his own
purposes and the betrayal of that dream
was the real crime

  the ears of chets horse pricked forward
suddenly and chet tightened his grip on
the reins the sun beat down in the little
canyon its heat intensified by the reflection
from the rocks chet felt the burning of his
skin and knew it was partly from tension

  he didnt want to kill breckinridge he
didnt want to kill anyone but there was
no choice it was kill or die and again it
was les gunther who had brought that con-
dition into being

  for a moment chet considered sinking his
spurs and trying to make a run for it through
the canyon a man on a running horse made
a mighty poor target he might be able to
get away with it but before he could com-
pletely decide he saw the movement in the
rocks above the trail and-knew that breckin-
ridge had already drawn a bead on him
chets shout echoed back and forth across
the narrow canyon dont do it breck
and immediately shattering the echo came
the-blast of the rifle

  the lead tore savagely through chets
shoulder nearly knocking him out of the
saddle he fought to regain his balance
while he jerked his own rifle waist high and
fired he heard his lead screaming off a
rock and then an answering blast from
breckinridge chet kicked his right foot free
of the stirrup and dropped to the ground
using his horse for a shield

  he fired twice across the saddle before the
horse dropped without a sound shot directly
through the head chet stood there blood
streaming down his left arm he heard
breckinridge say im sorry kid im sor-
ry as hell
ride with the gunsmoke judas



  there was a smash of sound that exploded
into darkness chet felt himself falling into
a bottomless pit and a dark dizzying cloud
kept rolling down and piling up on him
smothering him in the moist blackness he
remembered the night the cattlemen had
come to the kansas community -he remem-
bered burying his mother and his father and
he remembered folowing the loose-jointed
avenger les gunther a man of god who
would lead grasshopper and drought starved
people a man who would grintl his heel on
land grabbing murdering cattlemen an eye
for an eye he remembered and he could
see his father reading from the huge illus-
trated bible but even now he couldnt for-
get that same bible taught a man to turn
the other cheek

  everything seemed terribly real the dark
pit into which he was falling had slimy stone
walls he gripped at the walls until his fin-
gernails were torn and the pain was alive in
his arms he lost his grasp and fell into total
darkness

  and there in the rocks above the trail
breckinridge looked at his still smoking
rifle he knew lhat he should pump one or
two more shots into the body that lay there
below him that was the way les gunther
would have done it but breckinridge
couldnt bring himself to do it damn it
kid he said softly you shouldnt never
have tried it shaking his head he mounted
his horse and turned back toward camp   

  it was deep night when chet wainsworth
opened his eves the velvet dome of heaven
was spangled with brilliant stars and there
were silver shafts of light reaching down to-
ward the black outline of the rolling hills
it made him remember the pictures he had
seen in his fathers bible he lay there quiet-
ly feeling a strange contentment as the soft
breeze funneled down the rocky canyon and
bathed his face

  for those seconds it seemed to him that
he should expect the fiery angels to be stand-
ing above him the ones with blazing eyes
and flaming swords the avenging angels
the thought- remained but a second and
then with a great physical shock he realized
that he was alive immediately he tried to
move and a searing wracking pain tore at
him pinning him to the ground a voice
said hes coming around do you have
any more of that whiskey sam

  a huge dark shape hovered over him he

felt a bottle pressed against his teeth he
fought against it momentarily then swal-
lowed and the hot stinging liquid trickled
down his throat and built a fire in his empty
stomach the dark shape spoke with a
deep rumbling voice i dont like ghosts
miss jane i never did like ghosts

  the mans alive the soft voice said
maybe he is the man said but hes
close enough to being dead that he might
still be a ghost and if he aint a ghost hes
one of them gunther raiders that shot up
the town i tell you miss jane-

chets eyes focused momentarily and he
saw the girl she was like an angel bend-
ing over him he saw the dim outline of
her face the soft contour of her hair under
a flat brim hat he couldnt be one of the
raiders sam the girl called jane said
hes five miles from town isnt he he
must have been one of the settlers and he
was shot by the raiders for some reason
what you aim to do with him miss
jane the man asked

  take him up to the line shack with us
the girl said can you lift him

  miss jane the man said with convic-
tion there aint nothing sam cant lift
the darkness came again and now there
was a soft swaying movement and chet
wainworth gave in to it he was not sure
if he had dreamed these things or if they
were so he only knew that at the moment
he didnt care it didnt make that much
difference death he decided was sometimes
easier than living a long time later voices
awakened him

  he stared up at rough hand-hewn rafters
and light trickling through the cracks be-
tween shakes he was in a bunk of sorts
his clothes had been removed and he was
wearing a mans shirt that was big enough
to serve as a nightgown he stirred uneasily
and realized that his torso and left shoulder
were bound tightly with bandages he let
his right hand stray to his face and found a
thick matted growth of-beard and when
he touched his lips they were dry and
cracked his cheeks felt sunken and hol-
low

  presently a door opened the light momen-
tarily blinding him and then the opening
of the door was filled with the tremendous
bulk of a man with a body like the trunk
of a tree and huge arms and shoulders that


fifteen western tales

sloped up into u bull neck chets eyes
moved up and the man grinned exposing a
mouthful of solid gold teeth you a little
late for breakfast mister he said

  youre sam arent you chet said

  the big man threw back his head and
laughed and the sound rumbled all through
the room of the cabin doggone i guess
you aint a ghost after all sam said
leastwise i aint never had a ghost call me
by name before miss jane doc he bel-
lowed

  two more people came into the cabin
one was a tall sparse man and chet thought
of him immediately as a preacher the other
was the girl and now chet started searching
his mind wondering if there had been dreams
scattered through the blackness or if this
was an actual person and she had really
bathed his face and brushed the hair off his
forehead the girl came to the bed smiling
its been a long time she said

  how long chet asked

  week the girl said im jane bryan
and this is doctor acton its lucky for
you and the rest of your people that he was
around

  its more than luck the doctor said
he had a deep resonant voice this boy
had the man upstairs on his side you go
on out jane i want to have a look at
him

  thoughts started building in chets mind
they were almost tangible as if he could see
them they were like an inverted pyramid
the small thought at the apeex was the name
of bryan focused and sharp and then there
was another row of thoughts and another
and another always building always ex-
panding until suddenly he was remember-
ing les gunther and breckinridge and old
nate and he was remembering the twelve
wagons in the  little valley the farmers
who were going to claim free land land that
was already claimed by bvran the cattle-
man

  the doctor was fumbling with his ban-
dages thinking about something son
the doctor said

  jane chet said jane bryan shes a
cattlemans daughter

  thats right the doctor said going on
with his work why

  a cattlemans daughter chet wains-
worth said she saved my life

  any reason why she shouldnt the doc-

tor said his voice firm and low and sure

  chet thought of the cattleman who had
killed his father and mother and the name
of bryan kept drumming against his ears
he squeezed his eyes tightly closed i dont
know doc he said theres so damn
much i dont know

  he opened his eyes and the doctor was
staring at him intently admitting that this
is the first step toward learning something
the doctor said quietly

chapter two

an eye for an eye

chet sat on a stump in front of the
line shack the good sun pouring
into his mending body there was
a basin of warm water on his lap and the
girl was standing by him her left hand
against the side of his cheek she dipped the
straight razor in the basin and shook the
water free and smiled at him if shaving is
such a painful process she said i should
think all men would wear full beards the
razor scraped noisily against his cheek

  i feel like a darn fool chet said i
never had a woman shave me before
well jane bryan said ive never
shaved a man before so were even

  why do you bother with me chet
said

  the girl looked at him intently she had
blue eyes the kind of blue that sometimes
comes in the twilight when the shadows lay
thickly against a bushy slope curiosity
she said and he knew it was more than that
i want to see what you look like under that
beard she puffed out one cheek distorting
her face do that she said

  he felt a soft langorous contentment such
as he had never known in his life and then
like a wedge splitting his peace of mind
came the thought of the settlers who had
taken their wagons into the valley he had
avoided talking about it but now he had to
know what happened that night he
said the night you found me

  she paused now and looked straight into
his eyes a band of raiders shot up the
town and tried to rob the bank

  tried he said quickly they didnt
get away with it	

  she was still watching him closely try-
ing to read his thoughts no one accom-
ride with the gunsmoke judas



plishes anything by force she said she
waited for him to argue that and when he
didnt she said doc acton was ready for
them

  doc acton he said puzzled

  doc is the marshal as well as the town
doctor she said she moved directly in
front of him and spoke as if she wanted to
shock him into some confession doc
killed two of them she waited expectantly
but he held his questions grimly silent
one man was quite short she said he
had red hair the other was a fat man with
two fingers missing on his left hand
clunny and breckinridge he thought to
himself he felt no real emotion i was
thinking about the farmers he said what
about them

  he saw the gladness come into her eyes
theyre your people arent they she
said

  i have no people he said brusquely
you talked a lot when you were uncon-
scious she said quietly i know theyre
your people

  he stared at her wondering how much he
had said wondering how much she knew
and suddenly he was seeing her as a cat-
tlemans daughter prying into his affairs
why did you save me he said so your
dad would have somebody to hang in the
middle of main street

  there was no responding anger in her
eyes but there was something deeper a hurt
if my father knew you were here you
wouldnt be alive she said softly he
hates nesters the same way you hate cattle-
men and just as unreasonably she turned
swiftly hearing a sound down the slope
and following her gaze he saw the six riders
in the flats below them she snatched the
basin from his lap and spilled the water
get in the cabin she commanded

  ive got nothing to run from he said
a deep anger in him

  nothing but a lynch rope she said
get in the cabin

  he stood up quickly and felt the pain in
his side and realized he would be completely
helpless to defend himself reluctantly he
went to the cabin and closed the door and
stood there breathing heavily remembering
old nates warning that he would be an out-
cast hated by nester and cattlemen alike
wanted by the law 

  there was a breech loading rifle hanging

on pegs on the wall and underneath a box
of shells on a little shelf he took the gun
and loaded it and stood by the front win-
dow peering between the rough curtains

  the riders were coming slowly up the hill
led by a giant of a man with a fierce red
beard chets mouth went dry and an old
hatred consumed him all the men were
armed with rifles and they had six-shooters
belted around their middles there were
coils of rope on their saddles he saw the
girl standing there in front of the door her
arms folded a completely defiant figure
the red-bearded man reined up close to her
ive come to take you home jane he said

  im not going father the girl said
quietly i told you that not as long as
you try to be god

  if i find rattlesnakes in my bed i kill
them pete bryan said he spoke across
his shoulder bring that horse up here
stinson if she wont get on it put her on
it

  a thick-set brutish man rode forward
leading a saddle horse you better come
along jane the man called stinson said
he was grinning wolfishly

  no the girl said

  i said put her on the horse stinson
pete bryan said

  stinson stepped out of his saddle he was
a thick man his sleeves rolled back to expose
hairy arms he started moving toward the
girl and chet from his vantage point could
see a growing excitement in the mans eyes
as he passed by then he stood beside the
girl and grinned dont run from me
jane he said ive got your dads per-
mission this time he reached out quickly
and put both arms around the girl pulling
her close to his own body deliberately pro-
longing the struggle the glass crashed as
chet wainworth pushed the rifle barrel
through	 

  get your hands off her stinson chet
said

at that moment big sam who had
-f- been out gathering wood came around
the corner of the cabin he stopped dead
still his eyes going wide and then he gave
a bellow of rage he rushed in and his
mammoth arms gripped stinson from be-
hind lifting the heavy man as if he were
a child he smashed him down against the
ground


fifteen western tales

  big sams chest was heaving his eyes
wild dont you never put your hands on
miss jane he murmured

  why you devil stinson exploded his
hand reached for his holster and chets
rifle exploded

  the bullet sprayed gravel in stinsons
face and stopped his draw pete bryan sat
there rage flooding his face peering at the
cabin who you got in there he said
finally

  no- one you know the girl said defi-
antly

  stinson picked himself up from the ground
its one of the nesters boss he shouted
who else could it be doc acton has been
takin care of the ones that got away and
shes been helpin him

  surround the cabin pete bryan com-
manded

  chet wainworth had reloaded the rifle
ill kill the first man that makes a move
he said softly im not one ot the nesters
im one of les gunthers raiders and i
learned the hard way how to deal with cat-
tlemen i been looking for you a long time
pete bryan ever since the night you burned
out a town in kansas just because nesters
owned it do you remember that night
pete bryan or shall i tell you about it

  pain that was greater than the wounds in
his body dragged at chet wainworth he
stood there in the darkness in the cabin
with the rifle thrust through the window the
bore centered directly between pete bryans
eyes his finger tightened against the trig-
ger and all the old memories and the old
hatreds were strong in him then the girl
moved directly between him and her father
and big sams hand reached into the waist
band of his trousers and came up with a
cocked six-shooter mr pete sam said
i worked for you a long time dont make
me turn against you

  pete bryan was suddenly an old man
he was tired and his shoulders slumped and
he stared instantly at his daughter dont
do this thing to me jane he said softly

  i cant stand any more father the girl
said and the tears were close

  the old mans shoulders straightened and
there was hatred in him too and old mem-
ories i aim to wipe out every nester that
was in that bunch that came into the valley
bryan said as far as im concerned it
makes no difference if theyre just dirt

farmers or part of les gunthers raiders to
me theyre one and the same and you and
doc acton wont change my mind if you
and sam and doc acton go on protecting
em jane ill count you as one of them
all right father the girl said quietly
then we know how we stand

  a sound that was half way between a
curse and a sob broke across pete bryans
lips he wheeled his horse savagely and
signaled to his men with a wave of his hand
he rode back down the slope toward the
flats spurring his horse wickedly and the
riders followed him a deathly quiet set-
tled around the little line shack

  the girl ran a short distance as if she
would follow her father then stopped and
stood with her hands gripped at her sides
she was sobbing so bitterly that chet could
hear her he leaned the rifle against the
wall and walked out into the sunshine you
were a fool to get mixed up in it sam he
said there was no need of it

  the mammoth man looked at jane bryan
and he looked at chet wainsworth what-
ever miss jane does is right mr chet
sam murmured i like to be right its the
only way a man can live with himself he
thrust the six shooter back in his waist band
and walked rapidly around the cabin

  for a long time chet wainworth stood
directly behind the girl as the memories that
were part dreams and part realities became
totally real in his mind she was standing
over him bathing his face pressing cold
towels against his forehead the memory of
her eyes was strong on him then he broke
away from his thoughts and said im sorry
jane your father wont change and neither
will i what i said just now was the truth
im not a farmer looking for land- im one
of les gunthers raiders im an outlaw and
a killer and it makes no difference to me if
a man runs cows or digs in the dirt just so i
get what im after

  she turned swiftly and she was facing him
the tears bright in her eyes the torment that
was in her plain on her face that isnt so
chet she said i told you you talked a lot
when you were unconscious i sat by your
bed and held your hand and you talked
to me as if you knew i was there you told
me everything you believed

  a man can lie he said

  she shook her head slowly not when
hes telling his dreams not when hes tell-
ride with the gunsmoke judas



ing of having his own land and building his
cabins and marrying and settling down and
raising children

  i never thought such a thing he said
bitterly

  you did chet she said and you had
talked about it before with a girl a girl
named lorraine pettigrew

his nostrils flared and the muscles were
tight knots at the butts of his jaw he
had talked then and he had told the
truth the real truth that lay deep within
him smouldering and churning the dream of
peace that was at constant war with his
hatreds and his thirst for revenge i lied
to her then he said i told her what she
wanted to hear there was deep resentment
in his voice ive ridden a long ways jane
and my one thought was to kill your father
anything i have done or said was building
toward that one thing i came here for
that reason and that reason alone if you
thought yoii could change me im sorry
about it because you cant

  i cant change you she said but a
man can change himself

  its a womans way of thinking he said
its broken a lot of hearts

  she seemed tired-too completely tired to
even raise her voice you fool she said
sadly you pitiful men you and my father
both if you kill my father will it end your
memories if he kills you will he sleep
better

  pete bryan sleeps well he said and
he eats well

  she shook her head theres no under-
standing in you is there she said you
dont see that what tortures you could tor-
ture another man do you

  i know what i know he said

  do you she said do you know that
my father made a mistake once because he
believed a lie do you know that he had a
brother-a brother he loved very much my
uncle my uncle was found there in kansas
stripped beaten and hanging from a limb
some said it was the farmers who did it and
my father was part of a band that killed and
slaughtered nd burned because of it

  she moved in front of chet wainworth
and made him meet her eyes my father
has never had a full nights sleep since chet
wainworth ive seen him sit in front of the
fire by the hour rubbing his hands together

twisting them and turning them trying to
rub the blood away and instead of getting
down on his knees and admitting his mistake
to god he keeps lighting swearing that
every farmer that ever lived brought this
thing on him when its only his own con-
science that bothers him a short sob broke
her voice and she shrugged her shoulders
as if it didnt matter any more go ahead
chet wainworth take a horse from the
corral ill give you your gun belt and your
gun and ill give you the rifle and the am-
munition too because youll need it go
ahead chet wainworth keep building a fire
under you revenge and your hatred and
sometime when it has consumed you com-
pletely think of lorraine pettigrew and the
dream you had-

  the tears spilled over and she ran toward
the cabin she paused at the doorway and
glanced at him briefly and think of me
she said bitterly

  she hurried inside the cabin and threw
out his gun belt and his six-shooter and the
rifle and its shells they landed in the dirt
in the yard and the cartridges scattered and
he had to pick them out of the dust then
the door slammed and through the shattered
window he could hear her sobbing chet
wainworth took the weapons and started
walking slowly toward the corral he saw
big sam standing there waiting for him
and then he saw the saddled and badly used
horse in the corral presently doc acton
came out of the shed and started unsaddling
the horse he didnt look at chet wain-
worth he spoke across his shoulder you
leaving chet

  you intend to stop me law man chet
said

  doc acton turned and looked steadily at
chet his cavernous eyes serious his thin
drawn face grey with tiredness why
chet he asked do you want t be
stopped

  i seem to have-run off at the mouth
chet said i figured maybe youd want to
be a hero you could set up a scaffold in the
main street of the town hang me and leave
me there for a day or so that ought to set
you in pretty good with pete bryan

  i suppose it would doc agton said i
suppose it would at that he stared stead-
ily at chet but im most interested in
setting good with myself chet that bay
there is a good horse youll find whats


fifteen western tales

left of the settlers in the little valley at the
end of the canyon and i reckon youll find
les gunther there too theyre about ready
for a leader fike him in spite of anything i
can tell them he turned ignoring chet
completely or maybe youd do as their
leader chet sam will saddle up for you

  big sam moved woodenly there was a
great weight inside big sam it puzzled him
and tormented him big sams thoughts
were simple and direct he had seen jane
bryan cry softly in the night during that
time when they didnt know if chet wain-
worth would live or die he had seen jane
bryan stand against her own father be-
cause of chet wainworth that was a
mighty big thing to sam that was a wom-
an choosing her man standing against the
world because of her man that was the
biggest thing there was sam figured he
shook his head i hope you know what
youre doin mr chet he said you bet-
ter know mr chet because if you dont
know i reckon im gonna have to kill you

chet rode away from the cabin slowly
he had put an arrogant set to his shoul-
ders for he wanted to show his contempt for
these people who seemed to be obsessed with
the idea that the world could be right

  he was fighting hard now to protect him-
self knowing that if he let down for even a
moment-if he dared to discuss this thing
with doc acton-he might be forever lost
again it was that old childhood struggle and
the complete inability to understand wheth-
er a man should claim an eye for an eye or
whether a man should turn the other cheek
he rode away and when he was out of sight
of the cabin his shoulders slumped and the
pain inside him hurt him until he wanted to
cry like a baby

  he made himself think of that night in
kansas and of those burning cabins and the
meetings that had followed he saw again
les gunther standing on a box shouting his
curse against all cattlemen into the torch
lighted night such talk had been food once
to chet wainworth and balm for his grief
it had been blood in his veins -y the something
a man needed to go on a man had to have
a cause and a belief and a strong belief was
one that was sired by blood and revenge
and the blind charge behind a flag

  chets shoulders pained him perspira-
tion was thick on his face and it ran down

his neck and down the crease of his back
he thought of jane bryan and not wanting
to think of her immediately thought of his
own father and mother and how they had
lived and worked together always striving
for something always struggling and get-
ting nothing he thought bitterly nothing
but flame and death for a lifetime of effort
and immediately he knew that was a lie
they had had each other they had had their
happiness they too had had a belief a
cause to follow and they had followed it
a belief that was imbedded in basic love
if fate had been cruel to them he supposed
that in their way they had turned the other
cheek and built upon those disappointments
and gone on but damn it they were dead
or were they

  he came at last to the canyon and the
scraps and remnants of the campsite where
he had broken with les gunther down the
trail he saw the very spot where breckin-
ridge had shot and wounded him and he
saw the place in the trail where he had fallen

  it gave him a feeling of great apartness
he sat there on his horse and stared down
at the spot where for a time at least he had
lain in death it was as if suddenly he had
become two different people one the dead
shell there on the ground the other this
whole man riding a horse and trying to make
a decision the feeling obsessed- him and
tormented him until it was almost as if he
had a choice to make right here in this very
place he could pick up that dead body
that empty shell and wear it again and ride
on or he could leave it there in the trail
start anew and make his decisions all over
again he rode down the trail glad to be
rid of the feeling that had been so strong on
him

  the little valley was a pleasant place its
grass carpet was sprinkled with wild flow-
ers that blared in the bright sunlight but
now there was a feeling of tension and ha-
tred that sullied the very air there were
two wagons there in the valley two out of
twelve suddenly chet knew the tragedy
that had hit this band of settlers

  he spurred his horse into a run forgetting
the pain in his shoulder and he searched
the faces upturned toward him he counted
them by the dead rather than by the living
ten men missing ten out of nineteen he
saw the women around the community cook
fire and by reading their faces he kew his
ride with the gunsmoke judas



count had been correct he dismounted
stiffly and stood there waiting to be invited
in or rejected not knowing which it would
be old luke pettigrew came forward
chet wainworth he said thank god
youre alive how about mr gunther and
the others

  the title of respect told chet that these
people hadnt recognized their betrayal by
gunther they still believed les gunther
was their leader and that he had fought for
them and been driven off i got separated
from the others chet said i dont know
how they are except that breckinridge and
cluny are dead

  good men both pettigrew said damn
good men his white beard trembled with
his rage and he shook his fist at his god
if les gunthers alive hes got ten more
teiders to ride with him i promise you that
ten more now and in time well have ten
times ten because therell never be no peace
until every cattleman is driven off the
plains

  there was muttered assent and glancing
at the men chet recalled again that first
night when les guther had talked his way
this was the dream stuff the building of the
fire the ideal that blinded a man until there
was no right except this one way it was
just a forward movement without thought
a stampede without reason

  he saw lorraine pettigrew detach herself
from the group by the fire and walk toward
one of the wagons he went to her and she
looked up at him her gladness unmasked in
her soft brown eyes ive prayed for you
chet she said quietly

chapter three

their type of man

he took her arm and walked away
from the wagon across the end of
the little valley where the wild
flowers were thick and the deep moist heat
of late spring lay over everything the fra-
grance of ie grass and growth was in their
nostrils needing only the scent of newly
turned sod to make a completeness it must
have been bad he said nodding his head
toward the wagons

  it was terrible chet she said we
were met by a blast of rifle fire her eyes
grew puzzled if you and mr gunther

and the others could have gotten to us-
he took both her shoulders and turned her
toward him look at me lorraine he
said look at me and listen i couldnt get
to you because i wasnt there in the first
place breckinridge shot me because i
wanted to quit gunthers band

  quit she said not believing

  gunther had no intention of helping you
he wanted to rob the town get what he
could get and go on gunther doesnt care
whether you ever get that land or not he
doesnt care about anything except himself
he saw the disbelief in her eyes and then
something that was almost anger you have
no right to talk that way about a man who
has dedicated his life to helping us she
said why do you talk this way
because its the truth he said

  she stared at him wanting to believe him
because she loved him not wanting to be-
lieve him because if he were telling the truth
then everything they had done was wrong
but pete bryan she said you told me
about him and of how you had to fight him
how you could never rest until you found
him-

  i found him he said and it was pete
bryans daughter who saved my life
lorraine pettigrew was staring deep into
his eyes she smiled but it was a smile that
trembled i see she said softly she
turned quickly so that chet could not see
her face i bless her for helping you chet
she whispered

  he stayed in the camp that night and was
fed and treated like a hero for no one but
lorraine knew that he had tried to desert
les gunthers band and the name of les
gunther was on every tongue almost like a
prayer

  if les gunther got away hell be back
luke pettigrew said i reckon if i know
les gunther hes out rounding up extra help
and well smash pete bryan and everything
thats his well clean a wide swash behind
us and let folks come in and settle and then
well move on to the next place wherever
there s a cow on free grass well move
chet wainworth listened a sickening con-
viction growing within him old nate wil-
liams had been right he was an outcast
even among his own people for as soon as
they discovered that he had turned against
les gunther they would turn  him with
a savage hatred for they were strange


fifteen western tales

these settlers they-were individuals every
one of them and yet they could be happy
only in a group they started making laws
before they unpacked their wagons for they
were a peaceful people but if any man broke
one of their laws their justice was wickedly
swift they avoided trouble and violence
but if trouble and violence came to them
they could fight back with the ruthlessness
of an indian

  well wait two more days luke petti-
grew said if les gunther aint back by
then i say we go it alone

  we need a leader pers legal said a
man cant jump on his horse and go off in
six directions all at once

  weve gol chet wainworth another
said you mary pour chet wainworth
another cup of coffee

  chet wainworth is the likely one luke
pettigrew said

  chet drank his coffee and stared at the
fire and the warm glow of being wanted as
a leader fell across him like a warm shadow
and then was gone maybe if we formed
a committee chetsaid carefully maybe
if we went under a flag of truce and talked
with pete bryan

  there was a long silence and then luke
pettigrew laughed uproariously and slapped
his knee danged if you aint got the sense
of humor chet wainworth youre shot
half to hell but you-can still joke

  the rest of the men roared their laughter
and it filtered out across the valley a strange
sound mingling finally with the weeping of
women whose husbands were dead

  so for two days they waited their impa-
tience growing as they saw their horses and
their cattle strip the little meadow clean
and saw their own food supply dwindle away
to nothing during those two days chet
heard much of the way doc acton and a
nameless giant had helped after the battle
there in the valley if it hadnt been for
them they all agreed they could have been
trapped and wiped out the giant had
packed in additional food and the doctor had
taken care of the wounded

  the doc worked as hard as if he was
gonna be paid for it one man said how
a man as fine as him can stomach livin in
a cow town is more than i can see

  the only reason he helped us is because
hes got an eye for business luke petti-
grew saidalways the cynical one he

knows if us farmers move in here therell be
that much more business for him luke
laughed shortly farmers have lots of
kids

  chet got up and moved away from the
men then he saw lorraine pettigtew com-
ing across toward him

tt was difficult for him to talk to lor-
raine now for there seemed to be so lit-
tle he could say to her every time he tried
to talk to her he found himself wanting to
explain about jane bryan he wanted des-
perately to discuss his feelings with her the
way he knew he could have discussed them
with doc acton or with jane herself but he
had no such basis of discussion with lorraine
and he found himself suddenly lonely when
he was with her 

  they walked together silently arm in arm
until they were a good distance from the
camp lorraine stopped suddenly she was
a pretty girl a small breeze stirred her
chestnut hair she looked up at him and
said quite seriously youve never kissed
me chet

  a man dont make a promise until he is
sure he can keep it chet said

  kiss me she whispered and she moved
close to him and tilted her face toward him
and he could feel the warmth of her the
longing

  he had dreamed of this girl a hundred
nights and he had seen her in the flame of
his campfire the fragrance of her flesh was
a memory in his nostrils and sometimes he
thought of her with a savage man hunger
for a swift second the possibility of fulfill-
ment was there in his eyes and she saw it
and waited expectantly and then she saw the
light die he leaned forward and kissed her
on the lips without taking her in his arms
she closed her eyes lightly and he did not
see the two tiny tears that squeezed from
between her lids thank you chet she
said its not a promise dont ever think
of it as such

  she turned and ran quickly back to the
wagon and he stood there tormented in his
mind knowing that in some way he had
hurt her not knowing exactly how

  a tremendous tumult rose over by the
camp chet looked that way and saw a
horse running erratically down the slope
a man was clinging to the saddle swaying
to one side and then the other one foot
ride with the gunsmoke judas



was out of the stirrup and the leg dangled
as if it had been shattered with an ax a
choking fear rose inside chet and he went
running headlong stumbling across the close
cropped ground the riders hat was gone
exposing the iron grey hair it was old nate
williams

   because he had been further up the valley
chet was able to reach nate well ahead of
the men from the camp he pulled the horse
to a stop and turned to help the old man out
of the saddle but he was too late nate had
already fallen he hit the ground heavily
and he lay there panting blood bubbling
across his lips he kept staring up at chet
his pupils round and bright i tried to quit
chet he panted glad to see vou made
it

  wheres leschet demanded kraft
and metzger they still with him

  the old man fought to answer his eyes
rolling wildly now his tongue licked the
blood from his lips kraft metzger les
he said theyre coming here les figures
he can organize a new band with these
men- the old man coughed fighting for
breath its wrong chet i tried to quit
after you left i knew i had to quit because
you were right chet dont ever forget you
were right-

  it was the last words nate williams said
or ever would say the men from the camp
came running up their breathing noisy and
heavy in the sudden silence nate wil-
liams aint it luke pettigrew said
vvhatd he say whatd he say about
gunther

  chet wainworth turned and looked at the
men and he looked beyond them to the wag-
ons and saw the women around the fire and
he saw lorraine pettigrw standing alone
and suddenly he knew that this thing that
had happened was not a fight that belonged
to these people or to any other group no
fight was a group fight but a struggle that
started in the individual and then spread
these folks were chips swept up in a tide
the same way he had been swept up and
they were wrong to be carried along this way
because they tvere not making up their own
minds to anything they were letting some-
one else do their thinking and that he real-
ized suddenly was the same thing that had
happened to pete bryan he had let others
do his thinking and he had ridden along on
a raid and because pete bryan was a rich

and powerful man his name had been re-
membered when other names had been for-
gotten

  what did les gunther say luke petti-
grew demanded again

  he sent word for you folks to wait right
here chet wainworth said

  wait luke pettigrew said then
what

  youll know by tomorrow chet wain-
worth said ill get word to you he
started toward where his horse was picketed

  and you luke pettigrew said what
do you aim to do

  i aim to go see les gunther chet said
him and me have got a couple of things
to talk over

  good luke pettigrew said explosively
then we can get things straightened out
around here

  thats what i figger chet wainworth
said softly you take good care of lor-
raine luke

tte was able to back track old nates
horse far enough to make sure that
nate had ridden down the canyon from
there he rode by guess and hope until he
came to les gunthers original campsite and
there again he picked up the trail and saw
that it led across the hogback down toward
the line cabin where jane bryan and doc
acton and big sam had been staying he
felt a quickening of his pulse as he thought
of jane but his real mission drove the emo-
tion from him

  he would circle around the cabin he de-
cided he didnt want jane nor the others
to see him for he knew now that this was
a thing he would have to settle alone

  he dropped into the swale and climbed
the low rolling hill and had reached the
top before he heard the first crack of rifle
fire coming from a great distance he
reined up sharply a sickening panic inside
him and then he sunk his spurs and rode
furiously down the slope his urgency put-
ting all thoughts of bodily pain from his
mind

  presently he came to the clearing he
could see across to the line shack and the
corral a good distance away and now there
was a rapid firing from the side window of
the cabin which he recognized as pistol shots
the answering fire from the corral was slow
and confident nearer on this side of the


fifteen western tales

cabin he saw three horses and knew that
one of them was les gunthers grulla dun
the horses stood spread legged heads down
they had been ridden to death and that ex-
plained to him the reason for les gunthers
stop here at the line shack why in the
devil didnt you give him horses if thats
what he wanted chet thought fiercely
why did you have to get mixed up in this

  he saw a man run from one cover to an-
other out there in the corral and he thought
he recognized the man as metzger chet
jerked his rifle from the saddle boot shoved
in a shell and rode straight in toward the
cabin intending to thrust himself between
the cabin and the men there in the corral

  at that moment les gunther and kraft
broke from cover and ran straight toward
the cabin crouched low ducking from side
to side there was no answering fire from
the cabin and chet remembered with a sick-
ening realization that he had let jane bryan
give him the only rifle big sam had a six-
shooter and probably not much ammunition
chet saw gunther and kraft plunging their
shoulders against the flimsy door as he raced
toward them and he was positive he heard
a woman scream

  chet threw himself from his horse ripping
open the old wound in his shoulder he
felt the throbbing pain of it felt the blood
seeping through his shirt he ran on foot
the rifle still gripped in his hand and now
he was yelling les gunthers name

  gunther half turned and in that second
the door opened and big sam came rushing
through his tremendous fists flailing stand
back sam chet yelled unable to fire now
for fear of-hitting sam

  but big sam didnt hear miss jane was
in danger and big sam knew only one thing
to do chet saw the big mans hands lock
around krafts neck he saw kraft jerked
from the ground and swung from side to
side and then sam threw him half way across
the yard kraft lit in a crumpled heap his
neck broken and sam turned toward les
gunther	v

  there was a muffled sound of a pistol shot
and sam kept pushing forward bearing
gunther down to the ground still fighting
with every ounce of breath that was in him
chet heard gunther scream there were
two shots from the corral and dust puffed
from big sams shirt as the bullets tore into
him

  big sam got to his feet and les gunther
darted inside the cabin there were three
more shots from the corral and big sam
stood there taking the lead shaking like a
tree under an ax with each smash of a bullet
he seemed to be totally blind and totally
unable to realize his position he started to
walk directly toward the rifle there in the
corral he walked with a steady deter-
mined gait that became a long shuffle and
chet could stand it no longer he too started
running toward the corral calling sams
name

  bullets kicked around chets feet and now
big sam had reached the corral fence he
tried to climb it he got one foot on the
bottom rail and that was as far as he could
go he fell that way and hung across the
fence his feet touching on one side his finger
tips touching on the other chet threw him-
self flat on the ground and started firing
reloading firing again he had never known
he was capable of the savage rage that was
in him now

  there was the sound of furious struggling
inside the cabin but no shots from that di-
rection over in the corral metzger was
fighting to keep cover behind a double cor-
ner post chet saw the mans shoulder
he snapped to his feet threw the heavy
springfield to his shoulder and fired metzger
spun out from behind the post gripping his
shoulder and chet fired again metzger
fell and chet loaded and deliberately put
another shot into the mans body before
running toward the cabin

  les gunther had knocked jane to the
floor at the sound of the door flinging open
he whirled to face chet a gun in his hand
chet swung the rifle barrel and crashed it
across gunthers shoulder the impact
knocked the six-shooter out of gunthers
hand and in the second he was off balance
chet swung the rifle again

  this time gunther was ready he reached
up and gripped the rifle barrel and twisted
savagely tearing it out of chets single hand
grip chets left arm hung uselessly at his
side an evil grin distorted les gunthers
face he came rushing in and jane there on
the floor reached out and gripped one of
his ankles

  gunther fell hard and chet was on top
of him slugging with his right fist beating
at the face of the man who had turned a
dream into senseless slaughter
ride with the gunsmoke judas



a dizzying blackness seeped over chet
and he could no longer tell what he was
doing the pain of his wound and the weak-
ness of his sickness overcame him he fought
against it and he heard his own breath sob-
bing in his lungs trying to gulp in new
strength he knew that jane was there with
him fighting with him doing what she could
he saw les gunthers face and he smashed
his fist against it and he knew he could not
raise his arm again there was not that
much endurance in a man

  when he regained consciousness he was
still there on the cabin floor the place was
a shambles the planks blood-splattered
he saw jane first her clothing torn her hair
hanging loose a wicked bruise spreading
across her cheek she was kneeling beside
him her hand caressing his face he looked
at her and knew he loved her and knew
that love was stronger than the hatred be-
tween a cattleman and a sodbuster he real-
ized suddenly that there were other people
in the room he turned his head and looked
directly into the eyes of pete bryan

  the old cattleman stood there his red
beard giving a fierceness to his appearance
but his eyes now were the eyes of a defeated
man pete bryan too knew that love was
stronger than hate he turned and stalked
swiftly out of the cabin a man who regard-
less of what came would have to keep his
pride

  doc acton came forward then he knelt
down beside chet wainworth theres
damn little use in patching you up boy
he said you just get yourself torn open
again

  chet tried to get to his feet les gun-
ther he said how about les

  hes outside doc acton said taken
care of

  howd you get here chet asked

  i hadone over to the settlers camp
doc explained i cut through town to pick
up some things and missed you that way i
guess jane and i decided that if we could
get the settlers up here to a meeting so we
could all talk we might be able to work out
something we couldnt go to their camp
because janes dad was watching for that
so i brought the settlers here

  theyre here now chet interrupted

  theyre outside with les gunther doc
acton said and by the way he said it chet
knew what it meant

   they decided to believe the truth about
gunther chet said

  it was big sam that made them decide
doc acton said big sam was a friend to
them when jane told them what sam had
tried to do and how gunther had shot him
dont talk any more jane said she
reached out and smoothed chets hair

   doc acton got up and left the cabin and
jane and chet were alone she leaned closer
and kissed him on the lips there was a
small sound that might have been a sob and
when jane and chet looked up lorraine
pettigrew was standing there in the doorway

  some instinct given only to women told
jane the identity of this girl jane stood up
slowly unable to meet the other girls eyes
and then she said quietly ill go lorraine
its your place here with him

   lorraine pettigrew managed a smile she
shook her head slowly from side to side
no jane she said

   he told you jane said

   thats right lorraine pettigrew said
and now her smile was genuine he told
me she turned and went outside

   on a tree a hundred yards from the cabin
the body of les gunther twisted slowly on
the end of a rope luke pettigrew and the
other settlers stood silently not proud of
what they had done and not ashamed they
were strong men men who hated violence
but men who would never run from it

   pete bryan saw them and in this moment
of rough justice he understood them and
knew them to be men of his own calibre

   if you come hellin and roarin back into
that valley pete bryan said me and my
boys will meet you with hellin and roarin
and if you think we give you a fight the last
time waitll you see the next one he spat
through his red beard if you come into
that valley quiet and peaceful like decent
folks he said youll be treated like de-
cent folks if you want to keep my cows
out of your corn you better build yourselves
some damn fences

   he jerked his horse around and rode down
the hill and the settlers looked at each other
and nodded their heads knowing that here
was a man they could understand

  inside the cabin chet wainworth and
jane bryan heard none of this but they
held to each other tightly knowing that
whatever had been wrong was now right
knowing for sure that it would always be
so

it teas bloody showdown hour in
painted rock and the sheriffs wife
could only count off the seconds
and hope shed won her desperate
battle to stay   

 the

deadly

second



the hands of the clock still
had several long minutes to
creep before they reached the
deadline

the knot under mattie camerons
heart tightened as she entered the
hunsaker store and read the pity in
the eyes of will hunsaker and when
pamela hunsaker darted a quick look at her
husband and began to chatter about the new
ginghams theyd just received from st louis
she knew it was true

  for the hunsakers were her friends a
the deadly second



kindly pair    friends of andrews too she
knew that well and she knew they were
sorry for her it was easy to see in their
eyes in their embarrassed manner for they
were simple people not skilled at pretense

  she listened to pamelas too-rapid discus-
sion of the new ginghams and fingered their
textures lovingly with fingers that were
numb and she too tried to pretend as the
hunsakers were trying but her mind was
racing

  so its a showdown she thought an-
drews going to fight him in spite of his
sore arm and she knew with awful cer-
tainty that andrew could not win not with
his draw slowed down by that stiff arm   
hurt two weeks ago when hed stopped a run-
away horse on the public square

  that pink and white checkd look awful
pretty on you goes just right with your blue
eyes and yellofr hair pamela was holding
up a bolt of cloth for her to admire but
mattie wasnt listening any longer she was
through pretending she had to talk to
try had to do something before she snapped
inside

  she pushed back the bolt of gay cloth
pam    will   she began then rush-
ing on cant somebody stop it andrews
in no condition to fight its all he can do to
hold a gun  or even use his hand to feed
himself she stopped staring at them from
one face to the other

  it was hopeless she saw it in their faces
andrew was the sheriff hed ordered bob
dell to leave painted rock shed overheard
scraps of conversation broken off abruptly
when she appeared at the post office earlier
in the morning now she knew bob dell
hadnt left town didnt intend to leave he
intended to stay and fight it out with the
sheriff    andrew

  and stiff arm or not andrew would face
him meet him for the showdown to see who
was boss in painted rock    law or outlaw
there was nothing she could do but she had
to try

  will hunsaker was squinting out the front
door of the store his leathery lined face
wore an expression of acute unhappiness as
he stared over toward the new yellow brick
courthouse in the square gazing over his
shoulder mattie saw that the clock in the
tower said six minutes before ten

  the store keeper shook his head and
turned toward her andys our sheriff

mattie he said softly he added and a
good one

  and hes also my husband    and i dont
want to lose him mattie said through stiff
lips

  i know i know will said gently then
he shook his head sadly this time but he
figures hes got his job to do i dont reckon
hed want anybody interferin in his affairs
and if hes made up his mind he wont
change it he never does

  mattie broke in hotly but what differ-
ence does it make whether bob dell leaves
town or not her voice was high strained
suppose andrew did order him to leave   
and he doesnt go what of it she felt
pamelas hand in a gesture meant to be
soothing sympathetic on her arm but she
shook it off why does it matter why

will hunsaker tried to explain pa-
tiently bob dells a gunfighter a
mean man hes like a diamond back rattler
apt to strike anytime and at anybody in
reach and hes lookin fer trouble if he
stays in town somebodys apt to get killed
 thats why andy told im to get out
of town figured it was his job to make him
leave before bob decides to throw down on
somebody

  that isnt it mattie cried you know
it isnt bob dells been trying for a year
to get a showdown with andrew wrhen hed
have an advantage like now when andrews
arm is still stiff she twisted her hands
nervously oh when will this country start
being civilized

  pamela answered as mattie knew she
would lbont you see honey she said
and her voice was low soft intense thats
why andys standing up to bob dell andys
part of what you just called civilization hes
the law and the law means civilization
and if the sheriff lets an outlaw gunfighter
back him down- she hesitated then
pointed to the new courthouse well that
new courthouse over there just wouldnt
mean a thing

  but mattie didnt want to listen she
pushed past her eyes blind with sudden
tears they didnt attempt to stop her
theyd tried to help tried to make her un-
derstand but she couldnt she didnt want
to she just wanted to save andrew-her
andrew

  outside her little heels beat an angry


fifteen western tales

tattoo on the plank sidewalk that ran around
the square she rushed blindly not knowing
where she was going

  then she wheeled suddenly held up her
skirts above the dust of the littered street
dodged between two teams and started
across the street toward the courthouse in
crossing she met mr stapleton the t  p
stationmaster who bowed and tipped his hat
politely but she hurried past him

   zack burnside andrews only deputy also
jailer was alone in the sheriffs office tilted
back in his chair with his feet on the desk
he was reading an el paso newspaper she
saw him gulp and hastily remove his booted
feet from the desk

  why howdy miz cameron this heres
a unexpected pleasure zack said uncom-
fortably he lurched to his feet removed his
battered hat to expose a damp fringe of
mouse-colored hair around a bald pate of
startling whiteness

  is mr cameron around anywhere she
asked trying to smile she never referred to
andrew by his first name in public and sel-
dom came to the office

  why no maam im afraid he aint
zack answered slowly seems like he said
he was goin over to sam sawyers hver
stable somebody stole a set of harness off
sam th other night

  something told her zack was lying an-
drew was somewhere else keeping an eye on
bob dell watching to see if dell left town
or not making sure no trouble broke out
she came to the point with a swiftness that
left zack no defense

   how long did he give bob dell to get out
of town her voice was hard andbrittle

  one oclock zack looked distressed
and fingered his bald spot nervously then
he unconsciously hitched up the heavy pistol
that sagged at his belt he frowned and
stared at the worn toes of his dusty boots

  what time is it now zack she asked

   zack tugged out a thick silver cased watch
he sprung open the cover and deliberately
studied the dial one minute before ten
he said not many men had watches in
painted rock but zack was one who did
clocks were scarce too in this frontier coun-
try such things were expensive luxuries
an idea began to form in matties mind

   do you think dell will leave she asked
quickly

  no maam i dont zacks tone was

blunt his voice roigh with some deep emo-
tion he continued to stare at his boots

  then theres no way to stop it she said
hopelessly

  zack shook his head not unless bob
leaves town before one there aint andy
cameron never changes his mind or loses his
nerve if bob aint gone at one hell be
right out there by them south steps lookin
for im like he told bob this mornin he
lifted his head and she looked into his eyes
eyes that held that faded bleak look she saw
in the eyes of so many western men   and
hated every time she saw it

  she tried another possibility is judge
musgrove upstairs she indicated the dis-
trict court room on the second floor over
their heads the old judge with his calm
good sense might know how to prevent the
battle

  no maam court aint in session this
week an i guess hes out at his ranch lookin
after things zack took a deep breath he
went on i reckon i know how you feel
miz cameron but they aint anything any-
body can do t stop it andy told im t leave
an if he dont pull freight outa here by one
-well-therell be trouble but ill be
around t make certain everythings fair
he paused and looked away

  there it was the western code nobody
could interfere to stop a gunfight once it was
fated all anyone could do was be around
to make certain everything was fair but
there wasnt anything fair about this she
knew it and zack knew it    and bob dell
knewit

  wearily she turned away thank you
zack its nice to know youll be around 
she swallowed    to be sure everythings
fair she went out aimlessly and halted in
the barren emptiness of the deserted corri-
dor down the corridor she could hear
voices in the county clerks office but she
knew no one there she wanted to see

  one oclock the fateful words rocketed
through her mind one oclock one oclock
one oclock clock clock

then the idea came to her a plan so
desperate she hardly dared believe it
might succeed she darted a quick glance
back into the sheriffs office to see if zack
were watching her but he had already re-
seated himself and was staring at the el
paso paper again with a troubled expression
the deadly second



on his tanned face she gathered her skirts
and stole quickly up the stairs

  when she reached the upper floor she
ignored the closed doors of the courtroom
she hurried instead to the ladder leading to
the attic which opened into the clock tower
she scrambled breathlessly up the ladder
and crouched in the hot darkness of the
attic feeling for the narrow plank walk laid
across the rafters that led to the base of the
sqfiare tower containing the huge clock

  it was the second time shed been there
once only a year before when the court-
house had just been completed and the clock
was being installed and tested andrew had
brought her his bride up to see its great
gears and mechanism at close range theyd
even watched by lamplight while the clock-
smith whod come all the way from philadel-
phia had installed the clock and adjusted
the hands of the four faces so theyd keep
the same time

  fumbling in the semi-darkness of the
towers base she found the heavy key a steel
shaft two feet long with a square end that
fitted into the winding gear she hefted it
in her hand wondering if it would serve her

purpose she started the swing that would
smash the gears of the clock

  then slowly sick with dismay she low-
ered the heavy key

  to smash the clock and stop it would not
accomplish her purpose out here in the
west a man who didnt own a watch or clock
could take a quick squint at the sun and cal-
culate instantly within a few minutes the
exact time of day the brief exultation she
had felt a moment before died away and she
sank down on the plank runway head buried
in her hands

  four feet from her ears she could hear the
heavy steady whirring and clicking of the
clocks gears somewhere in that intricate
mass of brass and steel something squeaked
faintly pleading for a drop of oil

  as she huddled there in her misery con-
scious of that relentless recording of the pas-
sage of time so near her she began to
grapple with yet another scheme it seemed
almost too fantastic  but there might be a
way time could be made to serve her in this
crisis hardly breathing she fumbled for the
tiny door in the north face of the clock
something clicked and it swung open leaving

fifteen western tales

an aperture just big enough for a man   
or woman  to thrust out an arm and reach
the hands of the clock she felt for the
hands

  it might-just barely might work she
muttered as her fingers closed over one of
the big metal hands  the long one    the
minute hand she pulled stoutly on the hand
moving it forward a few inches she paused
tugged it a little further then she snapped
shut the little door and turned to the south
face

  opening the little door facing south she
peered out searching in front of one of the
bars and saloons along the south side of the
square she saw what-she sought bob dells
big red chestnut gelding with the white
stocking on its right rear foot was tied to the
hitch rack in front of tims bar she rec-
ognized the horse instantly because it was
famous for its speed and dell was mighty
proud of it she made a clucking sound with
her lips if the horse was there dell was
bound to be inside   where he could see the
south face of the clock    and the south
steps of the court house every time he looked
out even if dell owned a watch he wouldnt
bother to look at it with the big clock staring
at him from across the street

  she reached out a hand that trembled a
little grasped the minute hand of the clocks
south face and pulled it back    hard
then she slowly closed the little door and
climbed down the ladder and stole out of the
courthouse

  if anyone had seen her tampering with the
clock there was no way she could know she
just had to take a chance on that sooner or
later someone would notice the clock faces
did not show the same time but it might go
undetected for a day or two  at least long
enough for her purpose

  with renewed hope she made a dignified
circuit of the square covertly observing each
of the four faces in turn trying mentally to
estimate how many minutes it took her to
walk around the little square

  the hands on the south face showed ten-
six those on the north ten-fifteen allow-
ing a minute or so for the time it took her to
walk around that meant the north face was
approximately ten minutes faster than the
south face

  there was nothing more she could do just
then so murmuring a little prayer she turned
north and walked the three blocks to her

home where andrew cameron according to
his custom would eat his noon meal at his
own table

  as she walked swiftly gazing straight in
front of her she hoped she had- not over-
played her scheme had not changed the
time so much the difference would be obvi-
ous she realized her entire plan was founded
on a slender thread of time-ten minutes-
and if the thread snapped - she shook her
head refusing to think

  she had his meal ready even before she
heard his firm step on the little front porch
then there he was looming big and tall in
the tiny dining room

  howdy honey he greeted her quietly
and she ran for his kiss holding him to her
feeling the hard muscles of his arms and
chest then she backed off looked up at
him a hand on his right arm how is it
today andrew

  he was taking off his coat then the heavy
belt with the big gun and cartridges he laid
the gun carefully on a chair before he an-
swered better he said almost well

  but she knew it wasnt true because shed
felt him flinch a-little when he held her to
him for that kiss she turned away silently
bringing food to the table

  she hurried because she knew he wouldnt
eat until she had everything on the table and
was seated with him that was just one of
the things about andrew she liked a quiet
natural courtesy

as she brought food to the table she
studied this big beloved man of hers
at thirty-two andrew cameron was easily
the best looking man in painted rock there
was a clean rugged strength about him that
revealed itself inevery little gesture now
he was offering her the meat platter holding
it carefully in a big brown hand not awk-
wardly but competently and carefully it
was his way

  she looked at his broad forehead wide
jet black brows over deep-set intensely blue
eyes rather long naturally wavy black hair
the long hard jaw the strong tanned neck
but the nose was what marked him it was
a strong mans nose high arched but perfect-
ly straight and on each side of it two faint
lines were beginning to etch themselves down
the cheeks toward the corners of the wide
firm mouth it was the face of a strong man
a leader the face of a man to inspire con-
the deadly second



fidence-and hold it as he turned his head
there was something commanding in the
movement then he smiled showing the
white even teeth she had always admired

  the words they exchanged were routine
casual andrew was not a talkative man and
she always tried to match his mood

  how you feel honey his voice for
such a big man was not especially deep but
it had a pleasant resonance that always
thrilled her

  oh all right just fine try the green
beans she held the bowl toward him we
wont get many more unless it rains the
beans had come from their own little garden
patch carefully tended in the backyard

  theyre good he complimented chew-
ing his eyes were watching her she noticed
hed hardly taken his eyes from her face
since hed entered the house one oclock
he too was probably thinking this might be
all theyd ever have together-just one won-
derful year yes that was it why his eyes
were on her so constantly like his eyes were
memorizing her face

  she realized then hed stopped eating was
just sitting there looking at her quietly he
started to say something appeared to change
his mind and picked up his fork again han-
dling it carefully because of his sore arm

  more steak she pushed the plate to-
ward him invitingly he shook his head
smiling

  then how about some hot coffee she
refilled his cup carefully and set the pot back
on the stove

  she sat back down and toyed with her
food not eating almost shuddering at the
thought of food she looked up and met his
eyes again there was love and kindness and
a great hunger in them    and sadness

  andrew she choked what made you
take the job as sheriff

  a flicker of something came over his face
then it was gone and he was composed
again but there was a strange darkness
deep in his eyes

  somebody had to they thought i was
the man

  but why you andrew werent there
other men

  he shifted uneasily in his chair sure
plenty of others but most of em were too
quick on the trigger or liked the bottle too
well or   he paused and she saw that
bleak expression she hated come into his

eyes that look she couldnt understand

   she didnt know how far she dared to go
in spite of the love between them there was
something at times about andrew that
warned her not to go too far not to tamper
with man business

   thisll be my last termhe said finally
think i might study law judge musgrove
has offered to loan me some of his books

   mattie gave a little cry oh andrew i
thik that would be wonderful ill bet youll
make an awfully good lawyer

   but in the meantime he went on his
voice suddenly flat and toneless im the
sheriff

   mattie thought for a minute hed tell her
about bob dell and the showdown but he
didnt he didnt ever talk about such things
and if one oclock meant the end he didnt
want to worry her about it ahead of time
andrew was like that

   they finished their meal and andrew went
to rest a few minutes in his big chair while
he read a book the chair faced the front
door and through the front door the court-
house clock was clearly visible she saw him
glance at the clock as he sat down and she
looked too the hands said seventeen min-
utes until one

   she stacked the dishes quickly then joined
him she always waited until hed left the
house to do the dishes she never tried as
so many wives did to impose on his mas-
culine pride by wheedling him into drying
them for her she felt his few minutes at
home during the noon hour meant too much
to both of them to be wasted on such a trir
vial task and today of all days she wanted
every second of his companionship

   as she sat eyes alternating from the dis-
tant clock back to andrew she took an em-
broidery hoop in her hands and made list-
less motions with a needle

   she saw him glance up again staring at
the clock then felt his gaze on her felt the
fierce intensity of it she steeled herself to
remain calm

   then he was rising reluctantly to his feet
almost one gotta go honey he stood
there for a moment flexing the stiff fingers
of his right hand

   she flew to him suddenly wild dont
go yet she begged she felt him drawing
away dont go she whispered she put
all the seduction and appeal at her command
into her invitation stay here with me


fifteen western tales

dont go back this afternoon she clung
against him her body close against his beg-
ging him

she could feel him quiver knew he
wanted to stay then his hands were
removing her arms from around his neck
gently but with a strength she could not re-
sist he kissed her tenderly buckled on his
gun belt slipped his coat on

  all her life she had been contemptuous of
those useless helpless women who sit -and
wring their hands in time of distress but now
she found herself doing it sinking down on
the edge of andrews big chair she sat grip-
ping her hands together staring at the clock
in the distant courthouse

  the hands of the clock now pointed
squarely at one that meant andrew not
suspecting the clock on the north face was
fast was already at the courthouse standing
at the south steps waiting for bob dell

  and if her plan had worked  as she had
planned    bob dell would still be in tims
bar thinking he had ten or eleven minutes
eft    waiting    watching the slow min-
utes creeping past    and seeing andrew
standing out there by the south steps waiting
for him

  that was what she was counting on-dell
seeing andrew there early according to the
hands of the clocks south face standing
there    early waiting for him

  she tried to project her thoughts into bob
dells mind make him wonder worry make
him weaken in the face of andrews calm ap-
pearance of confidence maybe his arm isnt
bad after all he looks too confident thats
what she wanted bob dell to be thinking to
himself as he looked through the door of the
bar and saw the sheriff over there waiting for

him   while the hands of the clock still had
several long minutes yet to creep before they
reached the deadline    one oclock but
suppose bob dell didnt weaken

  while she tortured her brain with these
thoughts matties own eyes were staring at
the creeping hands of the same clock   
the north face in a breathless agony of un-
certainty she watched those iron hands and
her lips moved silently as she counted off the
slow seconds and minutes trying to steel her-
self against the sound  if it came finally
she shut her eyes unable to look   

  at last she opened her eyes there had
still been no sounds of shots fearfully she
looked at the clock one-thirty

  then something broke inside of her and
she was running out of the door down the
street    running frantically all thought of
pride or dignity forgotten

  she found andrew in the courthouse cor-
ridor calmly talking with a group of men
but he drew away from them when he saw
her coming and came to meet her he didnt
try to pretend now but just opened his arms

  his nerve broke he left town andrew
said his lips against her cheek 
zacks gruff voice spoke at their shoulders
the boys over at tims said bob was full
of fight right up to a minute or two before
one then the strain of waitin so long got
loo much for im he pulled out probably
wont ever be back once a man dont stand
up for a showdown hes through

  but mattie hardly heard him her face
was buried against andrews chest and all
she could hear was the steady measured
beating of his heart that faithful heart she
knew would always be true to her and to all
the things he felt were his duty    such as
the law and civilization	o o o

- expensive victory -

  pioneers took strong views on such things as free elections heres
how one town kept them free in the simplest sense of the word officials
of appomatox kansas facing a county-wide vote that would determine
which village should be the county seat signed a written agreement
with the officials of other towns to refrain mutually from fraud they
agreed also that the winning community should pay all expenses

  in those days it was as much as their lives were worth-let alone
their job when appomatox won and news of the agreement got out
the citizens suggested elevating their leaders to even greater heights

jesse harder tied the sorrel pony to
the rail and took two long steps across
the walk to the swinging doors of the
saloon inside he paused briefly his tall
angular body relaxed his eyes moving lei-
surely about the almost empty saloon be-
hind the long wooden bar the barkeep
watched him indifferently the two other cus-
tomers storekeepers by their dress turning
momentarily to scrutinize him harder
moved up to the bar nodded his head at the
barkeep and dug in the pocket of his jean
for a coin he found one and felt it tenta-
tively except for a few smaller coins it

seemed singularly alone this would have
to be a fast job

 where do i find the sheriff of this town
 he asked casually

 the two storekeepers turned to eye him
 again

 if you mean old man clayburn stran-
 ger one of them said hed rightly be sleep-
 ing this time of day

 a good idea jesse said

 you a friend of marks son the store-
 keeper said

 jesse laughed a little despite his forty
 years there was always some old man to call




fifteen western tales

 him son but how much longer could that
 last

  i dont know the man he said

  he kept his eyes away from the two store-
keepers he had seen them when he came
in and that was enough he knew their kind
they were harmless useless little men and
when trouble started theyd dive for the
nearest table and the barkeep was the same
  except for the shotgun under the bar and
the right safe opportunity to use it the
man was checking the shotgun now he noted
for his eyes were moving from jesses face to
a spot under the bar and back again nerv-
ously harder smiled significantly at the
man but the man was stupid-he didnt
understand

  the whiskey had made jesse sweat and he
pulled a soiled bandanna from his jeans and
wiped his forehead carefully leaving an edge
of caked trail dust along the hair line

  its hot he said

  sure is stranger one of the storekeepers
said laughing it aint likely youll be able
to wake up mark clayburn on a day like
this

  jesse didnt answer he turned half-away
from the men and leaned his elbow on the
bar outside under the swinging doors he
could see the street of the little town it was
late afternoon and the street was empty the
dust lying thick but undisturbed he stared
at it for a long time then sighed and turned
back abruptly to the two men

  will one of you tell the sheriff i want to
see him

  the smaller man looked started for a mo-
ment and then shrugged his shoulders

  its like i say mister on a day like this
he aint likely to want to be waked up

  jesse smiled thinly but there was a look
of impatience on his face this was always
the hard part the preparation it was easier
more painless if it was done quickly it was
a cleaner neater job

  wake him up he said curtlv tell him
i want to see him tell him theres a man
over here that wants to kill him

  the storekeepers iaw dropped but he-re-
covered quickly and started to laugh a gig-
gling high-pitched womans laugh then he
stopped suddenly his mouth open again

  thats a bad joke mister he said

  tell him jesse said he turned away
from the man planting his elbows loosely on
the bar behind him he heard the man fidget-
ing and then the quick nervous sound of his

boots as he went toward the door in amo-
ment his companion had followed him

  jesse took the remaining change from his
pocket and put it on the bar he looked up
at the barkeep and found that the man had
moved away from him slightly

  pour me a drink he said then go
down to the other end and stand in front of
that shotgun if you see anything that you
dont like grab it but grab it fast

the man poured the whiskey his hand
shaking a little his breath wheezing loud-
ly in the stillness of the saloon jesse watched
with indifference as he moved down the bap
he took a sack of tobacco out of his cotton
shirt and began making a cigarette slowly
and methodically he frowned once when a
few grains spilled out one end of the paper
for his sack of tobacco was almost empty
but in a few hours he thought it wouldnt
matter a hundred dollars would buy a lot
of tobacco it would buy a lot of whiskey
too and a shave and a good bath and a
steak and maybe after that a woman not
here though in some other town where he
wasnt known or was already forgotten it
wa always that way

hed been in little butte fifty miles to
the south when hed met the tolman
brothers and the other man the little half-
brwd named ramos the half-breed had
sem him near gila bend once after he had
kilpd a counle of apaches for a mexican
randier and had heard his name that was
a lorg time ago before his name had gotten
around but the mex recognized him all
riwht

  the two brothers had come up to him
thev needed a man they said he hadnt
tried to deny that he was jesse harder the
samp tsse harder that killed men for a
prc he had simply said

  whats your proposition gents it
wasnt only because he was broke it was the
easiest thing to do

  the tolman brothers were thick burly
men fair-headed and the proportions of
their bodies were so identical that except for
their faces they might have been twins
they were well past their prime and the pale
flabbiness of their faces indicated a life of
softness and inactivity the leaner one
spoke first

  im cole tolman he said this is my
the bushwhack bargain



brother jack in case youre curious

  i didnt ask jesse said but then shifted
his eyes to the mexican inquiringly

  thats ramos cole tolman said they
had moved to a table in the saloon now and
the two brothers arranged their chairs so
they were facing harder the mexican sat
far to the left so that jesse had to turn his
head to watch him

  you need a job harder the brother
said he watched jesse out of small crafty
eyes	j

i asked whats your proposition jesse
said annoyed at the mans lack of direction

  i like you harder cole said youre
a man who comes right to the point he
smiled exposing the gold teeth and glanced
warily around the saloon theres a man in
beekers gulch a sheriff its an easy job
a gun slinger like you shouldnt have any
trouble

  i never did a job on a sheriff before
jesse said he looked at the two brothers
casually

  its like any other man jack tolman
said vit was the first word he had spoken
and his voice was sharp and cutting

  if hes this easy why dont you do it
yourself jesse said he looked over at the
mexican and found him staring at him with
black expressionless eyes this mex here
ought to be able to do the job even if he
has to use an alley

  the mexican started out of his chair but
at a look from cole tolman he sank back
again his mouth was set in a cruel menac-
ing sneer and his lips twitched for a mo-
ment but he didnt speak

  were known in beekers cole said
its too risky if we have to well do it
ourselves but this way there aint no trou-
ble

  i never killed a sheriff before jesse said
thoughtfully the price will be high

  we figured a hundred dollars cole said
leaning back in his chair and folding his
hands over the fatness of his belly

  thats too low thats injun money
jesse said he reached his hand into the
pocket of his shirt for tobacco and then
stopped the sack of tobacco was almost
empty only a few grains left there wasnt
enough for a good smoke he was trying to
bring his hand down again unobserved when

and now to my nephew eugene i leave my bottle

fifteen western tales

jack tolman threw a sack onto the middle
of the table as he did so cole said a hun-
dred dollars harder

  jesse looked at the sack and then at the
mans face it wasnt a decent price not
what he was used to he shouldnt have
shown cole and jack tolman that he was
out of tobacco but they were no dummies
one look at him had told them he was hard
up he sighed heavily moved his hand
slowly across the table and picked up the
bag of tobacco he rolled the smoke deftly
but carefully and when he was about to lick
the paper down he looked up suddenly at
the two brothers they were watching him
patiently but there was a flicker of amuse-
ment in their eyes jesse licked the paper
down twisted the end and put it in his
mouth he scratched a match under the
table with a long sweeping motion and
looked up at the men again

  a hundred dollars he said disgustedly

  fine fine cole said leaning across the
table he spoke in a lower voice now the
names mark clayburn we dont care how
you do it as long as were not figured up
with it beekers gulch is about fifty miles
north of here well ride up with you to-
morrow as far as the forks and make a
camp you got all the next day to make
your move well meet you again that night
on the east side of town theres a cotton-
wood grove near the river theres an old
broken-down fence that some nester put up
once you cant miss it well pay you off
there

  jesse sat up straighter in his chair and
stared reflectively at a spot somewhat above
cole tolmans head his eyes narrowed a
little and a thin smile came on his face

  youll be there mister tolman he
aid

  the mexican came up out of his chair
his hand rested on his pant leg in front of
the tooled gun holster poised and ready to
draw

  sit down cole tolman snapped jesse
smiled broadly at the mexican but there was
no humor in his eyes ramos hesitated for a
moment and sat down again but his body
remained tense and rigid the two brothers
stood up then

  well be there cole tolman said

  i know you will jesse said without
looking up at them

  but remember cole said this is your

show if anything goes wrong dont look to

us

  did i ask jesse said and met the stare
of the other man cole tolman watched him
for a moment a sure unfriendliness showing
in his eyes then nodded his head and the
three men moved away

  jesse watched them thread their way
through the tables and go out the door of
the saloon for a split second he wondered
why the tolman brothers wanted the old
sheriff of beekers gulch killed but he
pushed the thought back he didnt want to
know

  that was the only code that ha had if he
could call it a code it was a simple thing
to kill a man and knowing why it had to be
done only complicated the matter it made
you think and in his business he had de-
cided long ago that to think was a thing to
be avoided he got up slowly took the sack
of tobacco from the table and went out of
the saloon

they rode out the next day and that eve-
ning made camp at the forks in the low
foothills where the maria fanned out into
three smaller more sluggish streams the
next morning he had taken his time in cover-
ing the remaining ten miles to the little town
of beekers gulch he had ridden into it
that afternoon down the only street indif-
ferent to the houses and buildings and the
few people that he saw

  even now in the saloon while he waited
for old mark clayburn the sheriff there
was a manner of total indifference about him
he seemed oblivious even to the barkeep and
the hidden shotgun it had taken him many
years to develop this indifference but he had
done it well so that now they hardly seemed
like people to him but more like the stray
cow that he passed on the trail an unknown
cardboard figure on the landscape he had
learned long ago that the less he knew the
less he would care

  but still sitting in this saloon in this
town that he didnt know and where he was
not yet known a faint curiosity was working
at the back of his brain he thought of the
man that he was going to kill old mark
clayburn and that all he knew about him
was that he was an old man with a fondness
for sleeping in the afternoon there was
more to a man than that and what had he
done that cole and lack tolman and that
the bushwhack bargain



little greaser ramos should want him killed
and once he was killed who would care a
wife a family there were many questions
that needed answers and suddenly for the
first time that he could remember he won-
dered at those answers

  but outside he heard the tapping steps
on the board walk and he knew that it was
too late it was too bad maybe but he would
never know he listened to the footfalls
deliberate and unhurried the man had
guts he watched over the swinging doors
and saw the mans head the black tall-
crowned sombrero and then the old man was
inside harder pushed himself back gently
from the bar balancing on his heels his right
hand hanging loose and relaxed at hi side
he studied the old mans face saw the long
gray hair and the hard-set but gentle mouth
then let his eyes move slowly downward and
noticed with a start that there was no gun
holster on the old mans hip he looked back
into the sheriffs eyes and smiled thinly per-
haps clayburn was a coward after all he
had seen men before who wouldnt wear their
guns it was a way of looking brave without
ever having to prove it

  you the man that wants to see me he
heard clayburn say breaking his chain of
thoughts

  thats right mr clayburn jesse said
slowly

  what did you want mark clayburn
asked he was standing loosely his thumbs
hooked over his belt his eyes calm and
searching

  i thought i said mr clayburn jesse
replied impatiently i thought i already
spoke my business

  clayburn shifted his weight from one foot
to another and watched the younger man

  who sent yuh here he asked

  it aint my right to say jesse answered

  the sheriff wrinkled his brow and brought
one hand up to rub slowly across his chin
then the softness went out of his eyes and
he spoke deliberately

  we dont want no trouble here son i
been running a peaceful town we got trou-
bles enough im asking you to leave peace-
able like and dont cause us no commotion

  im telling yuh old man jesse said
sharply i came here to do a job and i got
until sundown to do it next time you bet-
ter be wearing a gun

  suit yourself son clayburn said there

was a look of weariness on his face yuh
see i got a job to do too ill be where you
can find me but if yuh come lookin for
me dont take any chances

  before harder could answer the old man
had turned about and was striding out of the
saloon he pushed through the swinging
doors with both hands and turned down the
sidewalk jesse listened to his boots rapping
on the boards until they faded out in the dis-
tance he turned found the barkeep still
standing white and motionless by the shot-
gun and cursed softly to himself it was
just his luck to come up against a man with-
out a gun otherwise it could have been
over by now the job finished he disliked
the prolonged complications the waiting
but it seemed as though things had been go-
ing that way lately perhaps it was because
he was getting older or softer but you
couldnt kill a mart who wasnt wearing a
gun he had never done that

  he went out of the saloon and stopped on
the sidewalk looking up and down the de-
serted street his horse was still standing
at the rail head down under the broiling
heat of the sun he untied the reins and led
the sorrel across the street to an alley that
ran alongside the hotel the sun had moved
west some now and there was a thin line of
shadow along the unpainted side of the
building

  he found a ring set in the boards hitched
the pony again and thought for a moment of
removing the saddle but there was no tell-
ing when he might need it he went back
into the street and went down it until he
found the window with the sign marias
cafe painted crudely on it he paused for
a moment looking in the window and then
went inside

the restaurant was empty a narrow
counter and stools ran to the back of the
building and at the end near the stove a
woman was standing with her back to him
when she turned jesse was surprised he
had expected a mexican woman the maria
of the sign outside but despite this girls
black hair her skin was purely white he
took off his hat nodded to her and leaned
against the counter

  you maria miss he said politely

  no she said smiling she had clean
white teeth-the type he saw infrequently in
the places he had been


fifteen western tales

  where can i find her miss he asked

  you cant she said still smiling its
just a sign but im the owner can i help
you	 

  he hesitated for a minute watching her
then put his hand in the pocket of his jeans
and pulled out a watch he put it carefully
on the counter shrugged his shoulders and
smiled

  i need a meal he said i want to pay
for it with this

  the girl picked up the watch examined it
casually and put it down again

  thats a lot of watch for beans and a
piece of steak she answered she spoke
softly with a note of kindness in her voice
that rang unfamiliarly on jesses ears

  its all ive got he said trying to dis-
miss the subject and a man dont need a
watch to know when its day and night

  she laughed at that a low throaty laugh
and for a moment her eyes met his then
moved instantly away she went down the
counter toward the stove leaving the watch
lying where it was and while she worked
jesse watched her when she was through
she put the food in front of him and stood
by the window a few feet away looking out
into the street

  are you out of a job she asked her
voice quiet and interested

  i reckon you could say i was on one
now he answered but i dont get paid
until its done

  then you can pick up your watch she
said hopefully

  i dont know when ill be back this
way he said he laughed a little to him-
self humorlessly because he knew he would
never be back there were many places he
had left behind she seemed to welcome him
now but by sundown it would be a different
matter

  she had stopped speaking and was looking
out into the street and despite the near-full-
ness of his stomach he watched her with an
empty-bellied feeling she was tall for a
woman with long black hair and a rare
gentleness about her mouth and eyes she
was younger than he not yet thirty perhaps
but the difference in the ages seemed slight
and she had the body of a woman he
thought although her dress revealed nothing
she turned suddenly catching him watch-
ing her and although she smiled understand-
ing he felt the flush of embarrassment

along the roots of his hair it annoyed him
a little and he forced his mind to think of
something else

  do you know two brothers cole and
jack tolman he said he had been sud-
denly uncomfortable and was trying to make
conversation now but by the abrupt change
on her face he knew that he hadnt suc-
ceeded she looked at him intently a hard-
ness in her eyes that he hadnt seen there
before

  why she said sharply are they
friends of yours

  no miss he said quietly despite his
curiosity about those men he regretted that
he had spoken i heard tell of them

  theyre gamblers she said they run
the lucky spot down the street dads been
trying to run them out of town now for two
years

  your dad jesse said bewildered

  yes she said im mary clayburn
my fathers the sheriff of beekers gulch

  he was holding the cup of coffee and he
let it down abruptly onto the counter top
for a long moment he watched it hoping
that she hadnt noticed his startled action
when he glanced up she was looking out the
window again and her face had changed
there were thin worried lines under her eyes
that he hadnt noticed before

  thats why im afraid she was saying
dads given them two weeks to pack up
theyve sworn theyre going to kill him

  talks cheap miss he said uncomfort-
ably

  you dont know the tolmans she said
there was a tone of bitterness in her voice
theyll stop at nothing not even killing an
old man

  im sorry miss jesse said he wanted
to leave now he had enjoyed the coolness
of the cafe and more especially the warm
comfort of this womans presence but all
that had changed now he was sorry he had
stopped here even though it might have
meant going hungry until morning he was
sorry he had seen this girl and talked to her
and he tried to push the thoughts of it back
in his mind

  dont be sorry she was saying i
shouldnt bother you with my troubles

  no bother he said standing up he
watched her for a second seeing the soft
steadiness of her eyes and then said good
lay miss and thanks for the meal
the bushwhack bargain



  she relumed ihe stare and moved up to
the counter

  here she said picking up the watch
her smile broadened youll need this
were having a dance tonight down at the
old barn near the river its at eight oclock
youll need this to tell the time

  he looked at the watch as though he had
never seen it before and then up into her
eyes for a moment hesitating forgetting for
an instant that he hadnt the choice of yes
or no 

  thats a right nice invitation miss clay-
bum he said slowly but i cant accept

  then take the watch anyway mister  
mister she looked at him questioningly

  thanks miss he said he ignored her
request for his name she would know it
soon enough he thought she would hate
him then and hate herself for having been
such a fool  always pay for what i get
he said and started for the door

  but come anyway she said its your
choice she wasnt urging him now only
being friendly warm and friendly in a way
that he had forgotten

  he stopped turned about and for a fleet-
ing instant met her smile there is no
choice he said and went out the door

outsi ie the sun had left the street and
off to the west in the foothills it was
going down in a red-orange glow in the sky
there were a few men on the street now
hurrying to their homes or toward the
saloon old mark clayburn should be
around somewhere he shouldnt be hard to
find harder hitched at his gun belt and
started up the sidewalk his face tightened
now and his eyes narrowed a little against
the final brightness of the sun

  but he was careless the job had seemed
too easy at first when he came to the cor-
ner of the alley and stepped off the high way
with a thud he saw too late the group of
men standing by his horse his hand made
an instinctive movement toward the holster
but the men had their guns out and he
stopped short cursing to himself

  thats the man he heard someone say
he recognized the little storekeeper and his
companion of that afternoon in the saloon
there were two or three other men men
that he didnt know he tried to back up a
step but he collided with the walk and
stopped abruptly

  let him have it the storekeeper said
a man next to him raised his winchester
and jesse started to leap aside toward the
corner of the building the shot went wide
but his boot heel caught on the edge of the
walk and he crashed into the building and
rolled back again into the street the man
levered home another shell and harder got
to his knees his hand jerking at the colt
when he heard the voice yell hold it
men he looked up and saw mark clay-
burn coming up the alley from the rear he
had his gun out held steadily in front of
him and there was a look of quiet anger in
his eyes

  jesse got to his feet and clayburn came
toward him then stopped half-way between
him and the group of townsmen

  since when do you coyotes do my fight-
ing for me he said back over his shoulder

  this mans a killer mark the store-
keeper said hes jesse harder a hired
gunny

  sure and  know who hired him clay-
burn said quietly but im the law in this
town not you this man aint done nothing
but talk and its my job to see thats what
he keeps doing

  dont count on it sheriff jesse said
his eves fixed on the muzzle of the old mans
colt

  clayburn noted the direction of jesses
eyes smiled and slipped the gun into its
holster

  lookee mister he said we all know
you i got a dozen posters on you down at
the office youre a tough man but there
aint no man so tough that he needs killing
as bad as these fellas think you do for me
maybe i would a thought different twenty
years ago but times have changed im old
now and im peaceable youre no pup
yourself therell come a time when killing
a man wont be so easy to swallow itll
stick in your craw it wont go down and you
wont be able to spit it up youll learn that
right now im givin you your chance get
on that horse and start riding and some-
day give a man the same chance that im
givin you

  you dont give me any choice mister
clayburn jesse said shrugging his shoul-
ders indifferently

  thats right son there isnt any choice

  harder looked at the old man once and
then moved passed him pushed his way


fifteen western tales

through the group of men and mounted the
sorrel he kicked it and trotted it out into
the street riding stiffly his eyes set ahead
unseeing when he had gone some distance
he reined in the pony gently and turned it
half-around clayburn was standing where
he had left him his gun still holstered at his
side jesse measured the distance with his
eyes forty yards it was an easy shot for
him he could drill the old man before he
got his gun up then hooked around the
neck of his horse hed be a small target for
the townsmen there probably wasnt one
in the pack who could shoot him before he
got out of range he needed that hundred
dollars bad as bad as hed needed anything
in his life after all the man was armed
now he had his chance

  he wavered his right hand motionless on
the horn of the saddle then suddenly reined
the horse about and kicked it into a gallop
at the end of town he looked back again
the old mqji was still standing in the street
and he saw the door of marias cafe open
and saw the girl come out shed been watch-
ing he thought and the sharp doubt of his
actions left him it was with a feeling of re-
lief that he forded the river and turned to-
ward the spot where the tolman brothers
would be waiting

it was almost dark when he found the
stand of cottonwood and the old rotting
fence he rode along it slowly until he could
make out the dim forms of the three men at
the edge of the trees not knowing why he
loosened the gun in its holster before he
swung his pony out of the shadow and rode
into the clearing

  that you harder he heard cole tol-
man yell

  yeah jesse answered he reined in and
waited for the three men to come out to him

  ive got your hundred dollars cole tol-
man said softly they stopped their horses
in a semi-circle around him

  i wish i could take it jesse said he
tried to make out cole tolmans face in the
half-light

  whats that mean cole said quickly
his voice rasping and suspicious

  i didnt do the job jesse said evenly
the old man outsmarted me

  i dont get it harder cole said the
same disbelief in his voice old clayburns
an easy man to kill i could do it with my

left hand and thats for sure piker

   dont try it jesse said softly he edged
the sorrel off sideways bringing the three
men into fuller view even in the darkness
he could see the smoldering anger in tol-
mans eyes

  lets move men tolman said well
have to do this job ourselves

  he started across the clearing the two
men falling in on each side of him

  see yuh harder cole tolman said

  jesse didnt answer he- watched them go
across the clearing waiting until they were
at the edge near the fence he slipped the
colt out of the holster before he called soft-
ly

  i said dont try it mr tolman

  but as soon as he said it he knew he had
waited too long

  the mexican had already taken his gun
out and at the words he spun in his saddle
and fired the shot whined by jesses head
and crashed in the cottonwoods behind him
in a split instant jesse had the colt up the
gun exploded alongside the neck of the
horse causing the sorrel to jerk over but
jesse saw the mex double up gut-shot and
fall thudding to the ground

  two shots plunked into the hard dirt be-
low him and then another higher up whined
off to his left he brought the colt up far-
ther trying to steady the horse with his left
hand the gun jumped twice he heard jack
tolman let out a yell and saw him crumple
in the saddle

  he swung further to his right found
the dim silhouette of cole and fired
two shots rapidly but from the long whine
of the bullets he knew he had missed he
brought the pony around then peering into
the darkness waited for the returning shots
that would tell him where his man was he
heard the two quick explosions and felt a
hot searing pain graze along his shoulder
he fired instantly and missed again and in
one swift jerking motion threw open the
cylinder of the gun he knocked the empty
shells out and reached down to the cartridge
belt not looking fighting against the panic
the blood beating violently in his swollen
temples

he saw cole tolman come along the fence
line and turn sharply toward him and then
he saw the horse stumble against the broken
fence log and go down throwing the rider

it was at moments like these that
ginton regretted hed sold his

never
sell your saddle

when your stomach thinks
your throats cut and youre
set afoot on a strange and
hostile range youve got one
thing you never let go-your
saddle and if youre as lucky
as ernie clinton you have
one more asset-a fierce and
unconquerable pride

when young clinton awoke ho
found the white mare lying on her
side dead this did not surprise
him too much the mare had been rather
old and young clinton had been fully aware
the day before that the mare did not have
long to go still she was all the horse hed
had and her death left him feeling sad and
bitter

  there was not much that he could do he
would have liked to have buried her but he
lacked the tools he thought of covering
her with rocks but after looking around
he concluded there were not enough stones
in the vicinity the mare would have to

be left to the natural inclinations of the
scavengers this made young clinton a
little angry but then he told himself this
was in keeping with the way his luck had
been running lately nothing turned out
right for him any more nothing would ever
turn out right for him again he was posi-
tive of this for he had reached that degree
of despondency where he expected only the
worst

  it was one of those tough years in the
cow country -the bottom had dropped out
of the cattle market with beef selling for
as little as thirty cents a head the hide was
worth more than the cow

  he could always ride the grub line he
was not the only one doing that these days
but now his horse was dead and hed have
to drift on foot unless some rancher made
him a gift of an old crow bait that was how
he had acquired the white mare however
clinton did not want charity he had pride
and he wanted to earn his way

  there was nothing to be accomplished
hanging around so clinton lifted his old bat-
tered mcclellan saddle on his shoulder and
started walking he wanted to turn for one
last look of the mare because he had liked
the horse but he forcibly restrained himself
he just kept on walking he could feel the
pebbles through the worn-out soles of his
boots

  the saddle became a dead oppressive
weight clinton could not see much of a
point in carrying it he had no idea how
far he was from the next town or even the
next ranch perhaps he could sell the saddle
like he had sold all his other possessions
this was all that he owned in the world-
the clothes on his back and a saddle that had
seen its best days

  still a saddle was the badge of his pro-
fession a man was no longer a cowpuncher
if he did not own a saddle however clin-
tons pockets hung limp and empty his
stomach twinged now and then from hunger
the saddle would have to be sold-if he
could find someone willing to pay him some-
thing for it thinking this left him mean
and bitter inside it was at moments like
these that clinton regretted he had ever sold
his gun

he was walking along wincing every
time a sharp pebble dug into his feet
tad trying not to heed the pangs of hunger

when he heard the sound of a horse coming
up behind him pride would not let clinton
turn to see who it was or allow him to come
to a stop he walked on trying to pretend
that the saddle was feather-light on his
shoulder and that hed been partaking of his
three-squares-dailv with regularity

  the rider rode up beside clinton and
slowed his horse down to clintons pace
the rider said nothing for a while he was
squinting far ahead as if he could see some-
thing interesting at the edge of the horizon

  finally the rider spoke that your mare
back there a piece son

  clinton stumbled as a particularly sharp
piece of rock stabbed up through a break
in his boots he made out that it hadnt
hurt a bit and shrugged

  thats right he said

  the rider still stared at the horizon i
thought youd like to know i roped your
mare and dragged her to a cutbank and
caved enough down on her to cover her

  im much obliged mister said clinton
his throat ached and his eyes stung as if
some grit had got into them he supposed
he felt this way because he hadnt eaten
since yesterday morning

  i see youve still got your saddle said
the rider would you be interested in a
riding job-if i furnished the horse

  young clinton came to a halt he set his
saddle down on the ground and lifted suspi-
cious eyes up to the rider there was re-
sentment in clinton he needed help he
needed it badly but he did not want pity

  the rider had reined in his mount it was
a sleek and wiry blaze-faced black that
looked cat-quick in its movements the
rider took his glance off the horizon and
laid it on clinton his eyes were black and
opaque and hard they seemed to hold as
much feeling as two lumps of coal the
rider was tall and gaunt his face was lined
and seamed with many wrinkles and the
skin was burned almost black by sun and
wind he looked like he had indian blood
in him

  im not looking for a hand-out said
clinton with stiff pride

  there was no emotion on the riders face
he stared at clinton as if he were looking at
a fence-post or a rock this aint a hand-
out the rider said in his quiet toneless
way i need a man and im on my way to
town to hire one and i see you and im
never sell your saddle



thinking i can save myself a ride you want
the job son

  clinton had known so much adversity he
could not believe his ears the suspicion
lingered in him that it was pity behind the
riders offer but then clinton took another
look of the face and figured there could be
nothing soft about the man nobody with
eyes as cold and dead as that could know
of such a thing as pity

  whats the job like clinton asked
why dont you come and find out you
can always quit if you dont like it son
clinton reckoned he had nothing to lose
after all he did want a job more than any-
thing else on earth maybe this was the be-
ginning of the change in his luck

  youve got yourself a hand mister he
said trying to keep the jubilance out of his
tone

  the rider told clinton to climb up behind
him on the black and clinton did he braced
his old mcclellan kak against a thigh and
they started off riding double the rider
smelled of horse-sweat and woodsmoke which
to young clinton were the sweetest odors
in the world looking down he saw the

gun in the mans holster the weapon was
a  colt with a long seven-and-a-half inch
barrel the handle was black and worn
very smooth as if it had seen much use

  after they had ridden about a mile clin-
ton said im ernie clinton mister

  im called valverde said the rider

  after that they had nothing to talk about
the only sounds that rose were those of the
blacks hoofs on the trail   

  valverdes place lay at the edge of the
badlands it did not look like much of an
outfit valverdes brand was double v and
to clinton the few cows he saw wearing this
iron were sleek and fat despite the sparse-
ness of the graze but this he figured was
probably because valverde did pot have too
many head and so what little graze there
was sufficed to put weight on the animals

  this set clinton to thinking if valverdes
place was rundown and he did not have too
many cows what did he want a rider for
valverde had just felt sorry for him clinton
thought and it made him angry to think
that he was getting charity again but he
told himself it wouldnt be for more than
one meal hed see to that

fifteen western tales

  valverde seemed to read clintons mind
when they had dismounted he waved a hand
towards the ramshackle buildings and corrals
and smiled

  it aint much he admitted but i got
business that keeps me away a lot i need a
man to fix up those corrals and to look after
the stock a frigid interest seemed to enter
those expressionless eyes youll earn your
keep son

  young clinton said nothing hed just
wait and see if the job was bona fide hed
stay on if it was charity and pity hed
pick up his saddle and start walking   

valverde had a partner name of duke
bedford he came out of the house
yawning and stretching as if hed just roused
from a deep sleep he listened while val-
verde said that hed hired a hand then
bedford said

  we dont need no hand

  ernie clinton pulled up short he was
carrying his saddle to the saddle shed and
bedfords statement halted clinton in his
tracks

  valverde said something soft which clin-
ton could not understand then bedford
spoke again he had a high twanging voice
that carried afar and he was making no
effort to keep it toned down

  you gone soft val give the kid a meal
and then tell him to move on we got no
need for no hired hand

  wrath and resentment ran through clin-
ton carrying his saddle he walked over
to the two men he felt valverdes eyes
flick at him with something more than im-
personal in them but young clinton was not
interested in that he knew only the swift
coursing of the anger in him

  bedford looked at clinton with uncon-
cealed contempt something of a dandy his
high-peaked stetson was cream-colored and
he was wearing a flashy red plaid shirt under
a brown and white calfskin vest a blue
silk scarf was tied around his neck his
trousers were pearl gray in hue and the legs
were tucked into the tops of ornate white-
stitched boots the gunbelt slanting across
his waist also had a lot of white-stitching and
the  in the holster had an ivory handle
however despite this fanciness of appear-
ance bedfords clothes all carried a layer of
dirt it was stuck on like grease on his hat
and vest and shirt and trousers and on the

skin of his face and hands it was as if
duke bedford had never heard of washing

  young clinton directed his words at bed-
ford i wouldnt take a hand-out from
you if i was starving and as if in mockery
clintons stomach gave a twinge he shoul-
dered his saddle and started away

  hold on son said valverde i thought
you were going to give the job a try now
youre walking off without so much as seeing
what its like

  clintons stride broke he stopped but he
kept his back to them

  valverde said quietly youre not being
fair to me son if you hadnt told me you
were taking the job id have gone on to
town and hired myself a man now ive
got to make that trip all over again

  clinton turned and lowered his kak to
the ground his eyes were defiant as he
stared at bedford i wont stand for no
shoving around clinton said stiffly

  you wont be shoved around said val-
verde i rod this place

  a small ugly smile played with bedfords
lips dont be a fool val what do you
know about the kid whats he like how
do you know you can trust him besides
we dont need no help

  for the first time a bit of emotion showed
on valverdes face the line of his jaw
tightened and his voice came quietly but
with a deadliness to it that was like a knife-
point jabbing against a rib

  im rodding this outfit duke any time
you dont like it you know what you can
do

  ernie clinton never saw too much of val-
verde and his partner they were gone al-
most every night returning at dawn and
sleeping most of the day it was in the eve-
nings before he rode off that valverde gave
clinton his instructions for the next day

  the job seemed genuine enough to young
clinton the ranch apparently had been
neglected for some time and he never idled
for lack of something to do he repaired the
sheds and the corrals he kept an eye on
the stock the place really needed a hand
and valverde and bedford seemed to have
no time for it

  still ernie clinton could see no point to
it the times were bad and beef on the hoof
was practically worthless it certainly did
not pay any one to keep a hand on at an
outfit like the double v wages had not
never sell your saddle



been mentioned when clinton had been hired
and he did not expect any he was perfectly
satisfied with his three-squares a day this
and the knowledge that the job had probably
prevented him from doing something wrong
he had been on the verge of going bad the
day valverde had picked him up

on this evening valverde came over to
clinton and said you could stand
some new clothes son heres an advance
on your wages run into town in the morn-
ing and get yourself a new outfit youve
earned a day off

  young clinton thought of the holes in
his boots and of the patches he had sewed
on to keep his clothes together and he flushed
a little he could feel valverdes eyes on
him they were keen and piercing as if they
were looking right into the maw of his heart
when he spoke valverdes voice was
strangely gentle

   a man neednt be ashamed of being poor
its bad only when a man has to be ashamed
of how he got rich remember that son
duke bedford came out of the house and
he and valverde mounted their horses they
rode off together ernie clinton watched
them go he knew it was none of his busi-
ness but he wished valverde wouldnt do so
much night-riding   

  the new clothes and new boots made
young clinton feel right good he could not
quite put it into words as he tried explain-
ing it to himself all he knrw was that the
new outfit had boosted his feeling of self-
respect not so much because it was new but
because he had earned it rather than having
 received it as a gift

   on the way back to the double v he was
overtaken by two riders they told clinton
to pull up and then they arrayed their
mounts side by side in front of clinton one
of the riders was a short beefy man with a
red face and a tawnv mustache the other
rider was tall and slat-thin with a gaunt
hollow-cheeked face

   the red-faced one said my names fred
aderhold that there is bruce partridge
were valverdes neighbors

  clinton nodded in acknowledgment he
said nothing his heart was pounding a lit-
tle as if in anticipation of something un-
pleasant

  you been working for valverde a month
now aint you said aderhold

  clinton nodded again

  aderholds eyes swept clintons brand new
clothes doing all right i see aderhold
murmured

  resentment and anger flared in young
clinton i bought these clothes out of my
wages anything wrong with that
no-o drawled aderhold with exag-
gerated indifference only we cant see
how an outfit the size of the double v can
pay the way of three men in times like
these

  i dont see where its any of your busi-
ness snapped clinton

  ill show you where its our business
said aderhold the color of his face deepen-
ing the timbre of his voice thickening
were warning you this time only kid
maybe you dont know it but valverde and
duke bedford and some others have been
running off our stock to some secret place in
the badlands there they butcher the cows
and skin them and dry the hides the hide
right now is worth more than the cow but it
wont last like that when the day comes
that beef prices go up again we want to cash
in on that to make up for these poor times
we wont be able to cash in if we dont have
any stock you understand kid

  i never stole another mans beef in all
my life young clinton said indignantly

  im not asking you to own up to it
said aderhold his tone flat and uncompro-
mising im just telling you that if youre
smart kid youll get out of the country
were going to find that trail into the bad-
lands one of these days and when we do
theres going to be a bunch of hombres kick-
ing out their lives at the ends of ropes   
duke bedford rode in alone one morning
he was driving a couple of calves and he
herded them into a corral they must have
strayed from their mammies he told ernie
clinton i thought id drive them in so you
can brand them

  with our brand asked clinton
whose did you think said bedford
dismounting he unsaddled and turned his
tired buckskin into a corral

wheres valverde asked clinton
vals away on business said bedford
hell be back in three-four days he was
eyeing clintons new clothes you buy
yourself a gun he asked casually

  there are things i need worse than a
gun said clinton


fifteen western tales

  i dont think so said bedford one
of these days youre going to wish you had
a gun

	he yawned and started for the house
clinton watching him go kept thinking
about what bedford had said of valverde
valverde could have gone to sell some hides
the thought made clinton angry and sick
he didnt want it like that he wanted
valverde to be honest and respectable but
clinton realized sadly that there was noth-
ing he could do about it he could leave
that was about all but he owed something
to valverde   

when valverde returned four days la-
ter he looked angry there was a hard
bright glint in his black eyes and his mouth
was pinched tightly a muscle kept twitch-
ing at the base of valverdes jaw

  duke bedford had done no night-riding
while valverde was gone clinton had begun
to hope that that part of it was over for good
he wished for that even if it meant that
he would no longer be needed then at the
double v

   valverde planted his boots firmly on the
ground his legs spread a little his thumb
was hooked in his cartridge belt when he
spoke he looked neither at clinton nor at
bedford

   ive come across a couple of our calves
following two of fred aderholds rafter a
cows who did that branding

  the pulse began to pound in clintons
throat i did he said

  why said valverde

  there was sadness in ernie clinton he
could see how it stood there was only
trouble for him here now and it would be
best if he left but he hated the thought of
going away

   i thought they were ours he said sim-
ply

  valverdes eyes moved now and fell on
young clinton valverde was squinting so
hard his lids almost touched his glance
was practically a palpable thing on clinton

  couldnt you read the brand on their
mammies asked valverde

  their mammies werent around said
clinton he wanted to explain the all of
it but there was a strange reluctance hold-
ing him back he had been tricked by duke
 bedford but he was not going to cry about it

  valverdes stare switched to bedford

why did you do it duke valverde asked
he must have known his partner very well
clinton thought

  bedford made no effort to deny it its
about time the kid started earning his keep
said bedford i thought id break him in
this way  a cunning smile curved the cor-
ners of his moiith hes no longer clean
val he can get sent to the pen for what he
did so he might as well start giving us a
hand in the badlands bedford spat im
sick and tired of the dirty stinking work
while hes here living on hand-outs

  i told you to leave him alone duke
said valverde this finishes us first
though i owe you something im leaving
the choice up to you duke either pull your
gun or drop your shell belt which is it go-
ing to be

  bedfords mouth twitched baring his teeth
in a grimace of rage and hate his hand
started to move toward his gun but then he
caught the gelid uncompromising glint in
valverdes eyes and paled a little the snarl
left his mouth then with a display of bra-
vado it came back wavered a little dis-
appeared he reached for the buckle of his
belt

  almost simultaneously the two heavy belts
hit the ground valverde turned a little drop-
ping his and in that instant bedford
rushed he loosed a wild swing that caught
valverde on the side of the head and sent
him sprawling bedford leaped in boots
seeking valverdes face

  valverde swore with hurt and fury grab-
bing one of bedfords kicking legs he pulled
and twisted bedford cried out as he lost
his balance and went crashing to the earth
but he was up instantly to meet valverdes
charge

  bedford started another prodigious swing
but valverde ducked under it and with his
head still down butted the dandy in the
stomach the breath whooshed out of bed-
ford his face turned green before he could
recover valverde was raining blows at him
his fists cracking with sounds as sharp as
gunshots at first bedford tried to retaliate
but he could not stand up to valverdes in-
sensate fury he worked on bedfords face
with a single-minded savagery the flesh be-
gan to split and the blood dripped from bed-
fords features to his clothes spattering the
close working valverde

  bedford was grunting with pain and fu-
never sell your saddle



tility he no longer tried to hit back rais-
ing his arms he sought to bury his face in
them for protection but valverde smashed
them aside and hit bedford flush on the
mouth

  he fell back moaning with hurt then
valverde smashed him again now bedfords
face was just raw bleeding flesh another
of valverdes blows struck him and he went
sprawling he was not unconscious but he
lay where he had fallen face buried against
the earth duke bedford had quit

  valverde stood there breathing hard
sweat dripping off his chin the mask had
slipped from his emotions and now his face
was a contorted grimace of pure and utter
ferality

  dont ever let me lay eyes on you again
duke said valverde because if i do im
killing you  

hphe sad and bitter part of it for clinton
was that valverde still rode at night
clinton was tempted several times to tell
valverde of the warning that had been de-
livered by fred aderhokl but then clinton
figured that valverde knew what it was all
about and he was just simply taking a cal-
culated risk besides clinton thought it
was none of his business valverde had never
once offered an explanation of his where-
abouts after dark and so clinton let the
matter lie but he felt ill at ease and ap-
prehensive about it

  this night ernie clinton awoke with the
sound of a running horse beating in his ears
he sat upright in his bunk his heart starting
to pound hard ears straining as he listened
to the thrum of the hoofs drawing nearer

  there seemed to be a sense of urgency and
merciless haste in the pounding run of the
horse and a thousand wild frantic fears
flashed through clintons mind then he was
out of bed and pulling on his trousers and
his boots the horse came to a halt now and
there was only the sound of its labored
breathing just outside the door

  clinton opened the portal and looked out
a full moon was riding high and clinton in-
stantly discerned the slumped figure on the
ground

  valverde clinton cried the sound
strangled in his throat valverde

  the mans head lifted as clinton reached
him he was trying to struggle to his feet
and clinton reaching down grabbed him un-

der the armpits and experienced the sicken-
ing feel of blood-soaked cloth under his
fingers

  valverde could not help himself to any
extent clinton dragged the man inside and
boosted him up on his bunk then clinton
lighted the lantern in its feeble light val-
verdes face looked drawn and gray

clinton stood there staring down at
valverde some of the smoke from the
lantern must have got into his eyes for they
began to sting valverde lay quietly eyes
closed his chest rising and falling the
blood from the wound in his back was al-
ready soaking the blankets

  what happened valverde asked clin-
ton

  a spasm ripped a small moan out of val-
verdes clenched teeth then he seemed to
relax that damn bedford he muttered

  was it duke who shot you asked clin-
ton

  dukes skipped the country said val-
verde eyes still closed but before he left
he sold us out aderhold and partridge and
i dont know how many others were there
waiting for us they strung five of us up
son i was the only one who got away
his eyes opened now and fixed on clinton
i had to get away

  youre safe now valverde

  valverdes mouth curved briefly in a gen-
tle smile it was the first time clinton had
ever seen anything like this on the mans
face then the smile died and a look of
anxiety came into valverdes eyes

  theyll be here after me he said reach-
ing up a hand and digging the fingers into
clintons arm youve got to run for it
son

  i cant leave you valverde

  dont start anything like that son
valverde said in his old hard way ader-
hold and his friends are in a hanging mood
tonight theyre out to put an end to hide-
rustling for good they find you here with
me theyll string you up

  but im clean valverde you know i
never was in it

  try telling that to aderhold said val-
verde his fingers dug with a fierce urgency
into clintons flesh look son i know
duke bedford and ill bet anything that
when he sold us out he told aderhold you
were one of us thats why i ran for it i


fifteen western tales

came to warn you son now get on a horse
and beat it take the blue roan im giving
him to you

  there was a cloying thickness in young
clintons throat he saw how inevitable it
was and grief rose overwhelmingly in him
im taking you with me valverde he said
i owe it to you

  again that strange and gentle smile
touched valverdes mouth forget about
me son you cant help me any more no
one can

  dont talk like that valverde

  a spasm of coughing hit valverde and
when it passed he was weak and shaken
blood edged the corners of his mouth and
his voice was barely audible in the quiet
room

  listen to me son be whispered for-
get about whats going to happen to me
itll only be something ive got coming i
dont hate aderhold or those others theyre
only doing what id do if i was in their
boots ive got a gun and when they come
ill shoot back but i wont try to hit any of
them you understand what im trying to
tell you son

  you helped me when i needed it val-
verde now i want to help you

  look son said valverde the only way
you can help me is to get on a horse and
beat it before aderhold gets here when i
was a kid i was broke and hungry one day
i was at the fork in the trail that day and
i took the wrong turn lots of times ive
tried riding back to take the other turn but
ii was too late for me you were at the same
fork the day i picked you up do you un-
derstand now son

  it was beginning to dawn on clintons
mind all the inexplicables were beginning to
unfold before his comprehension for the
first time he was seeing clearly the reason
for his job and the reason valverde had
never taken him into the badlands-and it
hurt

  some men have sons valverde went on
when clinton did not speak for them
dying is not too hard because they leave
something behind them they have sons to
do something good and fine after theyve
gone some men dont have anybody thats
when dying comes hard a man makes mis-
takes and he knows he can never fix them up
but if hes got somebody to leave behind
him and to live a good and clean life then

it kind of balances things and that man isnt
afraid to die any more do you understand
what im trying to tell you son

  it was crystal clear to ernie clinton now
it all made sense to him now he could
feel a mixture of emotions inside-regret and
sadness and grief but above all a great pride
that he had known a man like valverde

  you dont have much time son said
valverde aderhold should be here any
minute

  sure valverde sure said clinton in a
soothing voice

  he kept his back turned while he put on
his shirt and his jacket he did not want to
let valverde see the moisture in his eyes
clinton picked up a few belongings and went
to the door

  when he turned he showed valverde a
smile it was an effort for clinton but he
managed it rake him and dont grab
leather valverde he said

  thanks son

	then clinton was outside on the clear
night air he thought he detected a distant
murmur like the throb of galloping hoof-
beats clinton hurried to the corral and sad-
dled the blue roan he mounted and raced
away

  on a rise clinton reined in the horse in
the moonlight he could see specks deploying
about the buildings of the double v then
the shooting broke out he could see the
winking of the gunflames and the sounds of
the shots were faint and crisp after a while
the shooting stopped there was only silence
now clinton turned the blue roan and rode
away the throb of the roans hoofs keeping
time with the sad beating of his heavy
heart

  not long afterward times took a turn for
the better ernie clinton caught on with a
large outfit far to the north he made a
good hand he worked hard and saved his
money and when he figured he had enough
he quit his job bought a gun and rode off
in a hurry

  he knew how his life would be he would
settle down and live out his days in hon-
esty and peace but first he had a chore he
would not rest until this chore was done in
full

  in the seventy-two years that he lived
duke bedford was the only man ernie
clinton killed

it was getting along toward dawn in
dodge city and young barney stevens
was getting tired tired handing out
rotgut wiping glasses watching the bloody
shoot-outs tired of the texans in from
the chisholm trail who fought the civil
war over every night in the brackson-beg-
bie saloon

seth brackson strolled up the bar and
barney gladly poured him a shot of his spe-

cial reserve he studied barney from kind-
ly eyes beneath thick grey brows through
thick tobacco smoke and the smell of stale
beer the roaring sound circled round and
round barney his head ached his hands
werent steady

 still a hard town aint it barney

fifteen western tales

  hard as hell was barneys answer if
you hadnt giveh me this job seth itd have
finished me an i sure dont know what
poor clara would have done either

  how is clara

  barneys throat tightened a kind of sick
hopelessness hit him at the thought of his
invalid wife he shook his head getting
worse seth she just wastes away a little at
a time this towns killing her seth
brackson sighed youll have to have a
mighty big stake to take her back east
barney nodded i appreciate you taking
me in and giving me this job seth you pay
me good but a man cant save any money in
this inflated town i dont know what to
do

  brackson leaned forward this town
knocked the courage out of her and it did
the same thing to you barney you aint a
gunman you aint a cattleman youre a
farmer an thats what you came out here
to be i gave you a job when the texans
busted up your wagon an stampeded your
team but you need guts barney i cant
give you that

  barney flushed its money i need
thats all claras got to be taken out of
here and back where we can get a doctor a
specialist shell die in this country and i
got to get the money to take her out of it
brackson fondled his long black cigar
maybe she just needs some courage bar-
ney an aint gettin it from you

  barney tried to smile i know youre
tryin to help me seth but i know what
clara needs i got to get her back east i
was a damned fool for bringin her out here
but i thought i was gonna be a big pioneer
an start me up a nice farm my dad was a
farmer and its all i know but what chance
has a man got when the texans come in and
ride rough-shod over your land an bring in
cattle ticks and disease they never gave
me a chance anyway they got me before

i	even got unloaded

  it had been about six months since hed
come into the outskirts of dodge a bunch
of texans just in with a big beef drive from
texas had shot up his wagon run his team
off insulted clara and scattered his supplies
all over the plains then theyd made him
take off his boots and had chased him
through the main street of dodge firing 
slugs at his heels

  barney had a six-shooter on him then but

he didnt know how to use it well enough
hed figured to fight back at that band of
wild-yelling texans but he remembered
the leader was a big raw-boned tnan with
a thick black mustache who had worn a
grey stetson and a gray buckskin vest he
couldnt forget him

  and hed never forget clara either the
way shed stared her eyes getting big and
dark and how shed fainted when hed come
back sneaking through the dark like a
starved coyote then hed gotten drunk
and stayed drunk for weeks and gambled
away all their money hed been in a kind
of a daze until one night he woke up and
shook it off and taking stock realized what
had happened to himself-and to clara and
then hed found out that even in a wild town
like dodge city one man can be the friend
of another

  it was seth brackson who gave him a
job bar-hopping thats where barney had
been ever since licking his wounds be-
hind the bar he earned a bare living and
spent his spare time hating the west and
above all hating that nameless texan who
had insulted him

gitthis town aint so bad in its way
barney brackson was saying and
al texans aint untamable hellions that
big fella who broke up your wagon and shot
the ground from under your feet was a
gunman blacky jethro a damned good
gun rannie but not a thing to make friends
with

  theres too much money in this saloon
of yours barney mumbled i need money
and i see all this raw gold dust eagles an
double eagles going back an forth an i
think of clara up there wastin away an it
drives me crazy

  money is something you can use only if
youve already got the qualifications to use
it brackson said an as i said afore
barney that texan bunch put the fear in
your bones an thats what youve got to
rid yourself of

  barney ruffled then i aint a coward
brackson but who the hell would want
to stay and fight a town like this in his
right mind this town just dont make a
pretense a being a place to live in

   voices blurred in over the roaring volume
of course laughter there was the tinkle of
glass and tinny music blared from the piano
draw fast-or die



at the end of the sawdust floor several
gamblers came from the card rooms upstairs
and sauntered down the bar and stood be-
side seth brackson to order drinks

  barney served them and his heart swelled
and his stomach felt empty as he saw their
rolls of green and yellow bills big enough
to choke a longhorn steer one of the
gamblers a lean tall dude in a frock coat
with a bowler hat set back on his bald head
was corey begbie bracksons partner an
easterner who had helped finance brack-
sons saloon venture he was the brains
brackson the front

  as a tip begbie contemptuously tossed
barney a ten dollar bill barney slid the
wet paper off the bar and stuffed it under
his apron into his levi pocket

  another gambler a whiskey peddler who
made his pile sneaking in sugared alcohol
to the indians swore and pounded the bar
lost my damned dirty shirt agn he
yelled

  barney stared at the big roll of bills
another gambler was counting off casually
his fingers twitched on the bar rag and he
licked his lips the gambler who always
lost sneered at barney

  you got a real good racket you have
barney cant recall brackson or begbie
here ever hiring a dude tinhorn for a bar-
jumper afore dont even carry a gun do
you a fine racket big tips every night
all the free rotgut you want maybe filchin
the till here an then what a setup barney
you know i think ill get me a nice little
wifie an spread the word around that shes
fainty-sick near to dyin then maybe
bracksonll take me in an set me up with
a soft job if-

  bracksons usually kind face went hard
and his blue eyes iced over his right hand
flashed across the air the heavy diamond
ring glinting the gambler who always lost
swore and stumbled back a red gash ap-
pearing across his forehead blood running
down into his eyes

  brackson rubbed his ring thoughtfully
you been riding the kid too much he
said go out an peddle your alcohol and
stay out a here the kids all right but
youre not now keep yore claw away from
thet hoglaig-and git

  but anson didnt move instead he bent
in a half crouch snarling his hand hooked
above the walnut butt of his six-shooter

  barneys throat was dry as his hands
clenched the bar then he saw begbie and
the other gamblers step back out of range
as brackson flipped back his coat and
dropped his hand to a double-barreled der-
ringer in a shoulder holster

  an expectant quiet filtered down the
length of the long room and slid up the un-
painted stairs above the piano the little
fat man who had been playing the same jig
tune over and over stopped and turned
around tables and chairs in the mud-
colored sawdust of the floor scraped back
men backed away from the bar the busy
roulette wheels and dice tables in the far
corner went momentarily out of business

  barney felt sick in the stomach in his
nostrils the smell was thick and rancid and
hot the small of dodge the smell of death
and stale beer and bad whiskey a drunken
woman with faded blond hair looked up
from a table and laughed tonelessly then
dropped her head back down in her arms
overturning a bottle of whiskey

  barney had seen it too many times to be
bothered much except that now he thought
of seth brackson going down with a bullet
in him and it made him cold inside he
thought about how now if he had any guts
he might step in and repay brackson for all
hed done for him a  was under the bar

  but barney just stood there frozen his
hands gripping the bar edge

  and anson said your crooked house-
boys have high-staked me to hell fer the
last time brackson youve taken me fer
every cent i ever hauled in here you run a
crooked game here brackson an im callin
your dirty hand

  barney took a sharp breath everyone
knew brackson and begbies honesty
everyone knew what happened when brack-
son was accused of the contrary he was
honest and square and handled his own
scrapes though there had been very few
run-ins between him and dodge he wasnt
a gunman and he wasnt the type of man
to draw the fire of others just a fair and
honest man seldom crossed

  but now the showdown had come anson
was lightning fast on the draw and brack-
son was short on practice

barneys hand crept down beneath the
bar the  kept there by one of the
other bar-jumpers touched his wet fingers


fifteen western tales

his hand jumped away from it like the
metal was red hot he blinked sweat out
of his eyes and felt his lips stretch into
a thin sour line brackson was right
brackson had staked a yellow-bellied coyote
and could expect nothing in return from
barney stevens

  he heard begbie say calmly dont play
with him seth ive hired a man begbies
voice rose all right blacky

  barney moved his eyes and the sickness
in his stomach curdled

  a big raw-boned man was walking across
the sawdust from the stairs a big man with
a gray vest wearing a grey stetson and a
black mustache and two low-thonged s
barney remembered he could never forget
blacky jethro

  everyone followed the big rangy gunman
as he walked up and stood a little to one
side of brackson bracksons eyes narrowed
i handle my own plays jethro get him
out of here begbie

  begbie said dont be a damned fool
seth

  blacky jethro moved in front of brackson
he moved with a powerful rangy ease and
his eyes shone with a black bright eager-
ness

  he said in a soft drawl holster up and
rabbit out a here anson an dont come
back

  you aint talkin to me anson said he
wiped the blood out of his eyes with his left
hand but his right still hung overjiis gun
butt

  im savin it to you anson but only once
more flag out

  anson ran his tongue over his lower lip
and for an instant his eyes looked longing-
ly at the batwings then he spoke and his
voice was low and tight you put me out
an then i reckon ill stay

  few saw blackys draw when the lead
caught anson in the shoulder he was still
sliding his gun free then his hand froze
and he groaned as a sudden blood stain
spread on his buckskins

  but blacky wasnt finished his right
fist smashed into ansons jaw and his left
fist made a sickening slap in ansons belly
then he kicked ansons leg and the peddler
sprawled out in the sawdust and lay there
coughing and grunting

  after a while blacky dragged him to his
feet and started him toward the half-doors

he threw him outside into the street and
then returned and leaned against the wall
just inside the doors

  for a moment barney couldnt take his
eyes from blacky he licked his lips and
rubbed his hands together but couldnt
turn away then begbie said we need a
man like that here seth theres too much
money here and we got to take care of it
now i should have asked you but you know
how it is

  brackson buttoned his coat all right
begbie he glanced at barney his face
expressionless reckon we do need a gun-
shark but keep him out of the card-rooms
keep him here on the floor an no place
else

  looking at brackson barney wondered
whether he imagined disgust in bracksons
eyes and in his voice but dropped the
thought as brackson said

  you can go see your wife now barney
bifback at five this afternoon got a lot a
cleanin to do

  barney went out the back door when he
left blacky jethro was still standing by
the main half-doors up front   

  barney was free now he hurried along
the boardwalk of dodge down the long
block that took him every morning at dawn
back to that stuffy little room where clara
was he walked fast past the line of un-
painted leaning clapboard shells facing the
railroad on front street and cursed the
town as a blight a blot a lumped scar
on the belly of kansas

  then he thought of the money pouring
through bracksons saloons in glittering
floods and how if he had even a small share
of it he could take clara and go back to
pennsylvania in style and in a wav that no
one back there could laugh at

  there was plenty of money in dodge he
had watched it make the big gambling tables
groan watched the dregs of the plains from
canada to mexico the buffalo hunters and
whiskey peddlers eastern toiyists and eng-
lish lords and russian grand dukes all with
big fat rolls of bills and all barney got
was a measly weekly pay check and a tip
now and then tossed unseeingly at him
like bones to a dog

  he had to have his share had to get
clara out of here he climbed the dusty
stairs through the dim light and hesitated
outside the warped cracked door to their
draw fast-or die



room in the tarryington hotel thinking of
the woman who could only lie in the half
darkness of a hot lonely room and listen
as the guns flared and funeral processions
passed on to boot hill

   he stepped in and softly closed the door
on the white bed the moon shone through
the window she stirred and he saw that she
was awake she was always awake waiting
when he came home at dawn

  he dropped to his knees beside the bed
her hands were like a childs damp and
cold they seemed transparent to barney
as he held them she was beautiful barney
thought even now the moon made a golden
shine on her hair her eyes were sunken
in dark shadows and her voice seemed to
drift to barney from a long way off

  ive been worried about you barney
barney buried his head in the damp
coverlet her hand brushed the back of his
neck softly gently every time her hand
caressed him like this it seemed it would be
the last time

  i heard a lot of shooting barney i
thought they might have-

  there was a sob in his voice dont
worry about me clara they arent in-
terested in me nobodys gonna kill me
we dont belong here barney

  well leave this town pretty soon now
ill get the money someway

  but we dont need much money bar-
ney

  he jerked his face up and pounded the
side of the bed with his fist everybody
laughed when we left remember that
clara they told me i was a young fool for
not stayin there but what was there
clara you always had money that little
piece a land of my dads wouldnt ever have
done anything for us how did i know that
law an order went out of this country when
the texas drovers came in but im not
goin back without money theyll not be
laughing when we go back clara ill see
to that

  she sighed and turned her face to the
wall her voice was muffled

  i just lie here and worry about you
 barney i keep thinking every morning that
youll never come back

   he straightened up slowly he got to his
feet -and slid back until he dropped into
a chair he stared at the dawn bursting over
the town

chapter two

barney calls a bluff

late that evening barney went back
to his nightly grind his face was
haggard twisted with his thoughts
all he could think of were those thick yellow
rolls of bills in the gamblers hands all
night long he had slept fitfully in a strange
yellow rain a rain of hundred and thousand
dollar bills if he got the money and got
clara out of here she would forget that
evening when hed run from the texans lead
slugs whining at his bare heels his face white
and his brain glazed with terror

  maybe even he would forget that too
even forget how he had stood frozen par-
alyzed while anson prepared to kill seth
brackson

   he avoided looking at blacky jethro as
he mopped up behind the bar he wondered
if blacky remembered him he never gave
any sign of recognizing him but then
blackys face never showed anything it was
expressionless a kind of bronzed dead mask

   it was pretty quiet in the saloon not
yet late enough for the evening rush barney
eased around the end of the bar and slipped
up the stairs he stood in the half-darkness
of the upper hallway hed been here once
before the night hed lost all their stake in
an all-night session of black-jack the hall-
way was studded with fourteen closed doors
these doors led into the card rooms at
the end of the passageway was an open
doorway where an oil light still burned
faintly yellow

   hed see brackson maybe hed apologize
for turning yellow that morning brackson
had known there was a  at barneys
finger-tips but what the hell-there was
nothing he could say to brackson a door
to his right was partly open and voices
filtered through the sound of glass and the
smell of thick smoke

  a poker session still going barney
thought his mind spun dizzily he knew
what kind of a game that would be hun-
dreds of thousands of dollars piled on that
table like leaves on an eastern road at fall

   stumbling a little barney went on down
the passageway and looked inside brack-
sons office next o it was begbies office
closed and locked and silent

   there behind a flat desk brackson sat


fifteen western tales

his chin was slumped on his chest his hands
flat on the table top the ashes of a dead
cigar were like gray dust on the front of
his checkered vest

  brackson he whispered hoarsely
seth-

  brackson didnt move the oil flame
flickered in the lamp from somewhere on
front street came the staccato sound of
revolver blasts

  seth-

  he saw the safe against the wall it was
open he stepped inside the room seth
he stared at the shadowed corner where
the opened safe stood

  the voice spun him around it was
begbie he stood tall and expressionless in
the doorway his thumbs hooked in his
jeweled belt his bowler hat on the back of
his head maybe hes asleep barney may-
be he dont want to be disturbed hes
always falling asleep like that at his desk

  sure barney mumbled he went past
begbie and back downstairs and went to
work behind the bar as the time passed he
thought of brackson of that opened safe
of brackson sleeping with his chin buried
in dead cigar ash self disgust and fear was
a big lump in barneys stomach growing
bigger and thicker hed gone up there
looking for money he knew that now then
begbie appeared at the bar chopping off
barneys thoughts

  the gambler leaned across the bar his
pale face tight and his eyes too bright you
musta wanted the money awful bad barney

  what

  barneys eyes went through the haze of
smoke the almost visible mist of beer fumes
all at once the roaring sound of the saloon
seemed to slam into his brain he saw the
gray vest and gray stetson of blacky jethro
standing by the half-doors standing there
like hed never moved would never move
again

  i say barney that you must have
wanted the money awful bad seth wasnt
sleeping not the kind you wake up from
somebody gut-shot him

  he smiled leadenly at barney some-
body barney- he held out a button
then let it fall and spin on the top of the
bar it was a button from barneys shirt
i found it by seths desk barney

  barneys mouth was sticky the words
didnt come out very well it was hangin

  loose begbie i musta lost it up there
when i was up there to see seth you saw
me i just went up to see seth

  you saw him barney didnt you may-
be your voice was the last he ever heard
what did you say barney-thanks seth
thanks for that big dumb heart is that
what you said barney

  begbie began eating slowly from the red
cheese and cracker supply on the bar

  i wouldnt do any harm to seth brack-
son barney said

  no one will now begbie said he was
a great man but not for this business he
trusted people i already sent word to
the sheriff

  begbie turned and hooked his elbows on
the bar thevsaloon had quieted as a stocky
hard looking man came through the bat-
wings and without looking at anyone went
up the unpainted stairs with two deputies
behind him

  begbie said bat mastersons mighty fast
with a gun but ive seen sheriffs with more
brains im goin up and tell him some-
thing barney wanta come along

  wha-what you gonna tell him bar-
ney whispered

  dont know not for sure not right yet
begbie said whoever murdered seth got
a mighty big haul out of the safe what i
say depends on what he does with the bills
guess there must have been a hundred
thousand in tapped currency sheafs in that
safe barney but it aint there now i
went back in an i stood there an talked
with seth for ten minutes before  found
out for sure why he didnt answer then i
thought of you barney and how much you
wanted to go back to pennsylvania in style
think bat masterson might be interested
in that

  begbie turned and barney followed him
toward the stairs the piano had stopped
and men watched them the whisper running
from mouth to mouth that seth brackson
had been murdered the safe robbed then
barney found that  in his hand found
himself shoving it under the waist band
of his levis

  begbie hadnt directly accused him of
killing brackson merely suggested murder
and the money just suggestion thats all
it took in dodge city a peculiar sensation
stirred in barney as his legs moved mechani-
cally up the stairs a terrilf feeling that he
draw fast-or die



was trapped  and alone    forever

  with seth brackson dead and gone bar-
ney realized how much strength the quiet
old man had given him how much barney
had depended on brackson and he re-
membered what brackson had said once to
him

  youre something like my son was to
me barney he looked a lot like you he
was very young like you and he hadnt
learned yet to be tough he never got a
chance to learn a sherman man shot him
down by kennesaw mountain

  maybe he thought barneyd grow into
something like he knew his son would have
if he hadnt been shot down at kennesaw
mountain barneys breath choked in his
throat he was almost glad brackson had
been dead because now brackson would
never know that barney had come seeking
up here earlier to try to steal a sheaf or two
of dirty yellow bills

  barney stopped and begbie went on down
the passageway toward bracksons office
where bat masterson and his deputies were
looking around who had murdered brack-
son who could have-

  it didnt matter because theyd stick him
with it maybe they would maybe they
wouldnt but anyway brackson was dead
and hadnt deserved to die barney couldnt
face him now even dead he slipped out of
the passageway into an empty card room

it was dark he stumbled through the
dark toward an open window it was a
twenty foot drop or so to the ground hed
run for it tell clara-what would he tell
clara no-hed go on anywhere fade out
maybe that would be good for clara then
shed know for sure what he was he
tipped over a box by the window

  he started to climb out the window and
his hands brushed against the canvas sack
tied up fast and hard he knew what was
in it he knew where it came from he
crouched down his eyes growing accustomed
to the light hifr fingers fumbled at the
heavy cord and then he spilled the thick
sheafs of tapped currency

  minutes marched past through the dark-
ness of the room as barney crouched there
a sheaf of yellow thousand dollar bills in
each hand the killer had cached it here
temporarily hidden it in that box waiting
to make a getaway someone in the saloon

  one of the gamblers who knew they wouldnt
be using this room for a spell

  he stuffed the money back in the sack
and started to tie it up the door opened
slowly a ray of light fell on barneys
hands on the sack

  in silhouette he saw a tall thin outline
and then the door closed and begbie was
standing over him his jeweled belt glit-
tered as did the pearl handle of his 
colt in its studded holster

  barney half rose on one foot and knee
still clutching the sack he had the money
now all hed ever need he could still try
to get begbie and if he did he could run
with the money with clara he could get
out of town tonight theyd never suspect
barney not for a while maybe he could
get free live free give clara all the gold
of heaven-

  begbie said theyre taking his body out
now barney carrying it on a door i
didnt say anything to masterson i didnt
know-but now-

  i didnt kill him barney said i
couldnt i was scared and stepped in here
because i thought you were going to tell
the sheriff id killed him i was going to
try to get away i found the money and-
begbies laughter came down softly
through the dark you cant even lie
strong barney you sound guilty guiltier
than hell

  barney dropped the sack he stood up
dont try to jump me barney barney
saw the pearl-handled gun slide free heard
the oiy click of the hammer going back

  wait a minute begbie im tellin the
truth you got to believe im tellin the
truth whoever killed him brought the
money here to hide it until he could get
it out of the saloon whoever did it will be
here to get the money tonight right soon
probably well wait here begbie well
wait together and hell show up then
youll know if im lyin no one will come
begbie was silent for a while finally he
said all right barney a skunk deserves
a fightin chance well wait a while but
not too long masterson is the prowling
kind

  they waited for what seemed several
hundred years begbie had moved back into
a corner and gradually barney could dis-
tinguish the highlights of his face the white
shiny bone structure and the hollows and


fifteen western tales

shadows between his breath was long and
even always calm always smooth was
begbie the man from the east the man
from chicago

  barney leaned back against the wall by
the window and after awhile he realized that
his right hand was gripping the butt of
the big  hed thrust into the waistband
of his levis the gun felt clammy and cold
under his palm he felt his fingers curl
slowly until he was gripping the butt tight
and hard

  he stared at the closed door he couldnt
take his eyes off of it the sounds of the
saloon below seemed to fade the sounds
from the roaring hell of front street that
faded too nothing existed anymore but
that door and a few scattered memories
the things a man always wants to remember
before he dies

  the things clara had said

  barney    ive never even been on a
farm    i hear its awfully wild out west
   but i know you can handle anything
barney    i know ill never have to worry
as long as im with you   

  barneys lips moved in the dark re-
member when you said those things clara
and then remember tonight but forget
what happened in between

  he remembered the scattered advice old
seth brackson had given him like he would
have given it to his own son if he hadnt
fallen in bloody georgia by a blue coats
rifle

  every mans a coward up until his first
shoot-out some men never have that shoot-
out and they never know whether theyre
strong or weak    when a man really
dies its clean and quick  but a coward
dies every minute of his life   and a coward
always lives too long   

  barney whispered silently the words echo-
ing back into his brain

  where ever you are seth help me just
stand by- thats all just watch and if some-
thing starts goin wrong tell me seth
footsteps went up and down the passage-
way beyond the door voices faded off and
on money-talk ten thousand dropped with
one card twenty thousand on the barrel-
head   

  barneys lips stretched painfully sweat
trickled down his ribs again and again he
had to swallow to open up his throat and
he finally released his grip on the colt

handle and found his fingers paralyzed
numb he was flexing that hand when the
door opened abruptly

  the broad stetson the broad shoulders
the tall rawboned frame the vest and hat
would be gray if it were light jethro   

  the big gunman hesitated then came for-
ward and closed the door he stood breath-
ing heavily adjusting his eyes to the dark
barney slid the heavy colt free lifted it he
drew in a deep silent breath sweet rare
breath when its a mans last and he
thought of all the things hed wanted to do
the big plains farm he was going to build
the waving oceans of wheat that were to be
his    the kids wild free sun-blackened
kids they would have been his too and
the thought of clara made a throbbing
vibrant ache in his head

  he waited for that sick empty fear that
helpless vomity fear and it didnt come
there was no feeling at all just a gray vest
and a gray stetson coming toward him
through the last twilight

  he heard his voice say no use walkin
any further jethro might as well die right
there

  jethros huge frame seemed to freeze then
shrink down into a dark tense blob his
voice was harsh whatn billy hell he
said

  its me-barney stevens-the stubble-
jumper you never gave a chance to stubble-
jump one afternoon i ran down front
street without any boots on a certain wild
texan was shooting at my feet im going
to kill you jethro

  jethros laugh was short and low it
takes practice to deal that hand clod-hop-
per

 the way you dealt it out to seth
brackson shooting him in the belly while he
had his hands on the top of his desk

  any ole way at all clod-hopper it all
plays out the same

the dark blob moved tiger-fast
swooping to one side and there was the
slap of flesh on leather barney had never
shot a revolver even in the light hed had
practice with a squirrel rifle that was all
all he could do was stand and keep slam-
ming in shots slamming them blindly and
fast and he did that

  hed seen the blasting orange stabbing
at him and dimly heard the blare and thun-
draw fast-or die



der now the sound and the flame stopped
he staggered back and leaned against the
wall the dark blob shrank lower and lower
and it fell with a dull thump on the floor

   now barney felt the blood searing his
flesh knew the way that bullets burned
under his skin

  begbie moved out of the corner his
voice was tight you did for em good
barney god but it was short

   a coughing curse came lip from the floor
begbie swore he aint dead

  his gun swept up froze as the voice
gasped from the floor

   damn your cut-throat soul to black hell
begbie    you been here    you let
him get me    to shut me up    hire me
to kill brackson then   

   his voice faded out beneath the sudden
blast of begbies colt

   begbies body turned slowly now you
barney you know too much im damned
sorry too

   barney tried to keep his body erect keep
it from sliding down the wall that barney
guessed was about as far as his short road
went he tried to lift the  and then
wondered if it hadnt been emptied of power

   footsteps pounded along the passageway
outside but no one dared open the door

   barney whispered    you had blacky
kill brackson so the business would be all
yours    but maybe blacky decided to
take the money  or maybe that was part
of your idea  a blind    and you planned
to get blacky all the time to shut him
up   

   begbie said softly that was the way
i had it figured out barney but you
werent figured in i never thought of you
bein in it now you can take all the blame
i can tie you and fethro in together and say
you both had a shoot-out

   barneys hand had been closing around
the back of the chair with a final thrust of
strength he hurled it upward it lifted
begbies gun arm as the colt blasted the
ceiling

  barney pitched away from the wall
brought his right hand up and around in
a heavy arc the pistol barrel cracked
across begbies face begbie groaned he
staggered back and the gun in his hand
flashed blindly as barney struck again

   he felt bone and flesh crunch beneath the
heavy barrel begbie went backward he

was crawling and barney fell beside him
he grabbed begbies shirt and held him
and he kept lifting and bringing the pistol
barrel down and he was still doing that
when someone finally worked up enough
courage to open the door

  but it was too late then to do anything
for begbie and after barney told the story
 one cared

	 

  they patched him up down below barney
sitting at a table of honor with everyone
gathered around bat masterson was mak-
ing comments and admiring barneys nerve
for waiting up there like that for blacky
jethro and there was us marshal earp
biting a dry cigar he was a stringy man
with the alert cautious air of a fighting
cock and his fingers played constantly with
his gun the nails clicking the metal and he
too had complimentary things to say about
barney stevens guts and all barney could
think of was how much he wished old seth
brackson was around to hear what they
were saying and that he could see claras
face again

  they took a long time fixing him up a
deep side slash and a punctured shoulder
are not easy to patch now and then some-
one handed him a sht of bracksons special
reserve whiskey barney didnt feel any
pain

  mike barlow bracksons lawyer took the
opportunity to read part of bracksons will
and everybody heard it and congratulated
barney with loud cheers and roars of ap-
proval

  i seth brackson hereby bequeath my
half of the ownership of the brackson-beg-
bie saloon to barney stevens a lad who
should know by now whether or not he can
handle it the way id want it handled  

  barney got up and started across the
sawdust floor

  think you can handle it that way
barney mike barlow called after him
pleasantly

  barney smiled ill be back to see he
said

  he climbed the steps of the tarryington
hotel this time with a firm hard stride he
opened the door and went in he bent over
the bed and picked her up and carried her
to the window a little gasp came from her
as she saw the dried blood on his shirt the
bandages

  the rank smell of dodge city came up
and through the open window its yellow
lights cast a soft misty glow over the ugly
buildings the smell was close to the earth
thick and it drove out the prairie smell
stale beer bad whiskey and flesh rotting
off the thousands of buffalo hides piled
twenty and thirty feet high alongside the
railroad

  barney breathed it in deep full breaths
clara said let me down barney her
eyes were bright and color flooded her
cheeks they stood there and barneys arm
was around her he told her everything
that had happened

  she said softly i knew it was some-
thing like that barney  felt it as soon
as you came in she swayed weakly but
there was strength in her it had always
been there barney knew and he knew it
would always be there from now on into
the coming years

  well sell the saloon and buy a lot of land
here clara

  she nodded

  youll be all right now

  yes barney i wont be worrying about
you anymore

  you dorit want to-go back we could
do that

  no barney its what you want to do
thats important

  barney breathed deeply in the street
below a horse charged wildly as the sway-

shooters emptying them aimlessly into the
air the thunder of sound echoed and died
between the unpainted buildings then even
the hoofbeats faded away and there was si-

andy curtis was one of the quiet
unsung heroes of the frontier
where fighting off marauding
sioux and fixing the talking wire
so that a message of peace could
inspire the world was all in the
days work

there was a sharp wind blowing
when the three minneconjou sioux
came down the slope of crying wom-

argued with each other as they rode south
toward the telegraph line

it is a medicine wire fights his horses

men washakie was at fort bridger and
winnemucca was in smoky valley they
could not see each other they could not
hear but the white men told the medicine
wire and when washakie and winnemucca
met each knew what the other had said it
is a medicine wire and  say leave it alone
black calf slapped his flintlock rifle in its
deerskin case my medicine is stronger
than the wire he boasted when the wire
is broken one man comes to fix it  say
cut it and wait for him

  elk robe made the decision fights his
horses is right elk robe said but black
calf has strong medicine do you black
calf ride back and forth under the wire
if nothing happens we will cut it

  in sand creek stage station andy curtis
listened to the clatter of the morse relay
repeating a san francisco dispatch mrs
marples the station keepers wife was wash-
ing breakfast dishes marples dad purcell
and ribidoux the hostlers were in the main
room the sounder of the way wire came
alive and andy copied when the message
ended she stepped to the door

  dry wells says the stage is through the
gap he announced therell be six pas-
sengers for dinner

  marples nodded and returning to his
stool andy tried to call blue hill but the
line was dead beyond the window he could
see the poles marching eastward the through
wire and the way wire strung between them
sagging in long curves poles and wire were
not two years old the first transcontinental
telegraph spanning the nation

  damn it andy curtis said and tried
blue hill again

  intervals during the next half hour he
tested the line always with the same result
it was open to the west dead to the east
that was the rule test for thirty minutes
then search find and repair the break for
twenty-five miles in each direction andy
curtis was the western union telegraph
company operator and lineman too the
half hour ended and he assembled equip-
ment climbing irons tools and a brand new
spencer rifle

  marples ribidoux and dad purcell were
in the corral when andy saddled his mule
dad purcell grinned toothlessly and said
that this never happened when the pony
express was running them boys went right
on through marples eyeing the spencer

suggested that andy take another rifle

you just got her marples said and
you dont know how she shoots take mine

   she shoots seven times andy answered
and thats good enough for me

   he rode off toward the east the spencer
balanced across his thighs

  below the slope of crying woman elk
robe fights his horses and black calf
well hidden in a nest of boulders waited
with the patience of their kind their pon-
nies were tethered in a coulee and before
them a full poles span distant two wires
were on the ground

   he is coming now black calf said it
is my plan and i will shoot him

   if you miss him he will get away elk
robe objected fights his horses and i
will shoot the mule each man checked
his priming each pushed his rifle between
stones thumbed back a hammer sighted
squinting

   andy curtis came down the line of poles
looking at the wires three pole spans two
-he saw the fallen wires and stopped rifles
boomed in the rocks the mule went down
andy thrown clear held to the spencer
got up ran and dropped behind the mule

  you missed him elk robe accused
but we killed the mule now we must
make him shoot and charge him when his
gun is empty he moved cautiously expos-
ing head and shoulders from the breast-
works of the dead mule andy fired

   instantly the sioux were on their feet
running charging in but this was no muz-
zle loader that they charged behind the
mule andy curtis worked lever and fin-
gered his trigger elk robe flinched from a
bullet burn across his ribs wheeled and
dodged back into the rocks

   black calf dropped and crawled to safety
fights his horses hid behind a boulder an-
dy curtis thumbed  caliber shells through
the trap in the spencers butt-plate filled
the magazine worked- the lever and then
waited

   there was no movement in the rocks no
sign of life at all the wires lay on the
ground almost touching the dead mule
wind whipped the grass and overhead clouds
scudded by then on the slope of crying
woman well out of rifle shot andy saw
three riders they went up the slope dimin-
ishing growing smaller rounded a shoulder
and disappeared

tt was nearing sundown when andy re-
turned to sand creek station east and
west bound stages had come and gone wear-
ily-for twelve miles on foot will tire a man
-he told marples ribidoux and dad pur-
cell the happenings of the day still weary
he called blue hill and dry wells inform-
ing the operators that the circuits were re-
paired andy curtis had done a days work
but food restores a man

  after supper he sat on his stool listening
to the clatter of the through wire relay the
hostlers and the station keeper entered the
office

  whats the war news andy dad pur-
cell asked

  theres a dispatch coming now andy
curtis answered and dipping his pen into

hill to
hell

the endless prairie the burning
desert the stark mountains and
the hostile savages were easy
enough for big bill shawn for in
his years as a wagon scout hed
conquered them all   but god
save him from this caravan of
mutinous greenhorns whod lose
their way anywhere-except on the
road to hell



kalder cried ill stop you
shawn from leading us to
klin



    by robert
    trmnell

the mountains had been before them
for so many days that their eyes had
shriveled from squinting at them
through the glitter of sun on the alkali flats
their skins were burnt black or blistered to
a fiery red but still they made their way
through the burning wastes intent on their
goal

   it was rough in the heat the spokes dried
out and rattled and the wheels shrunk until
their iron tires suddenly clattered off but
not until the wagon tongues snapped did
their tempers go

  the brunt of abuse was heaped on big
over the hill to hell



bill shawn but that red-haired giant riding
at the lead let the insults break on his broad
back he was big this man in buckskins
and little things didnt often faze him near-
ing forty years of age and at the height of
his physical powers a score of trails had
burnt his body into tight ropes of muscle
and hardened his mind to many things

  he knew what hey were saying but he
didnt care they were saying that maybe
hed run twenty trains into santa fe but
theyd passed the santa fe trail a long time
back they might even h helling that he
didnt know the way in oeaon any better
than they did it didnt -itter he knew
his own bullwhackers were loyal and that was
the important thing even though the new-
comers had twenty-five wagons against his
ten and stood as a sreenhorn majority
against his seasoned trail men

  once he had dared them  all right go off
north to the regular trail if you want he
had said were through the pawnee coun-
try now and they say theres no bad injuns
ahead but remember im takin this trail

  that had riled them he knew well enough
they said that they couldnt go it alone it
was clear to them that he was trying to trick
them any fool knew that there were hor-
rible injuns everywhere so theyd mumbled
and grumbled through a meeting in which
joel kalder the lawyer had delivered a fire-
side speech against shawn and splitting up
the party and that had been all except that
kalder had somehow established himself as
spokesman for the immigrants but even
that was negligible for by hook and by
crook and by cursing and cajoling bill got
them to the mountains

  they had double-hitched to the first bench
there the trail seemed to go straight up
so bill shawn hitched five teams to a wagon
and dragged it to the second bench from
there a bluff rose two hundred feet to the
top where an easy trail led off into the
plateau beyond

  the first wagon up was one of bills own
he tied the great rope himself to the dou-
ble trees then carried it up to the pulley
which had been anchored to a rock outcrop-
ping by a loggng chain that he meant to
sell in oregon he reeved it through and
for a moment glanced down the hillside

  below by the wagon was the surly gang
that was to heave on the rope and below
them a ten-horse hitch was dragging the

next wagon up to the bench further down
the rising yellow dust murked where the rest
of the train straggled upwards bill shawn
growled to himself damn greenhorns
then he jerked the rope through and again
glowered down the trail

  after a while he jumped down off the
rock with the rope in his big red-haired
hands and lunged down the hill as the rope
shrilled through the pulley he was down to
the others when the rope hauled him up with
a jerk and a cloud of dust burst up around
his boots

  a man called out of the crowd you no-
tice that rain cloud shawn

tte had noticed it and now he looked
up again it was gun-metal gray and
hanging right over them he glanced at the
speaker it was joel kalder the lawyer
his long face was cut by a thin smile he
was pleased by that cloud

  if that cloud breaks kalder said it
will turp this hillside into a river

  shawn swore then dammit well tloat
the vigons uphill roughly he turned on
his crew now git onto that rope and take
a strain but dont you forget a minute that
if you slip this wagons goin to go down-
hill like a gunshot out of particular hell and
blow a hole right through those folks cornin
up now strain damn you strain

  grumbling they seized the rope and ar-
ranged themselves along it so each man had
space to grip in it took a long time

  bill watched his hands on his hips until
theyd finished then he roared you polers
when we take a strain yank those poles out
of the wheels and go up alongside ready to
pole in when we get on top now ever-
body pull solid dont jerk consarn ye
pu-ull

  pu-u- he bellowed and steadily threw
his own weight against the rope dont
jerk pu-u-ii

  the chain up above them grated into
rock the pulley screamed shrilly as steel
honed against steel poles clattered out of
the freed wheels and men grunted heaving
on the spokes the merest movement raised
choking clouds of dust that hid the peaks in
the distance and narrowed vision down to
the yellowed wheel spokes on which the men
hung their weight or the coarse rope burn-
ing at their hands

  shawns own fists were fastened on the


fifteen western tales

rope like twisted roots of some giant tree
he felt the great backward surge of power
driving out of his unflexing legs the wagon
was inching forward

  the dust steadily thickened as thirty pairs
of boots stabbed at the slope but the men
coutinued driving their weight back down-
hill dragging the wagon with painful slow-
ness up toward the pulley and the rock the
sun burned down hot on their backs and
sweat was stinging in their eyes but still
no one faltered

  the pulling men were down behind the
wagon now it hadnt more than twenty
feet to go and the polers were yelling excit-
edly and preparing to jam the pole through
they used oak timbers from a wagon that
had fallen off a ridge and smashed up for
shawn did not trust green poles to hold the
wheels up at the lead he struggled and
they worked like demons to keep pace

  git on it you boys shawn bellowed
git back there away from oregon back
away from oregon so the wagijns can go
ahead his muscles bunched powerful but
his legs held firm and he chanted in the
rhythm of his work git away from ore-
gon oregon

  they took up his chant until suddenly
the spell was broken by frightened yells be-
hind in an instant bill shawn felt the rope
in his hands come alive and jerk away from
him he felt the rope dance and heard rocks
clattering and saw the yellow dust thicken
around him as men below rolled it up then
somebody yelled they aint holdin ahind

  the dust whirled up from behind and
then a great swath of it rolled down the
slope it was all a yellow nightmare and
bill shawns iron grip on the rope was as
secure as a mans hold on a fistful of water
the rope tail whipped his back in passing
and ripping through his hands was greased
by his own blood then the pulley shrieked
and the hurtling wagon crashed down past
shawn and into the yellow cloud of dust
from out of which men were fleeing with
fraptic haste

  shawn watched a poler jam his wagon
tongue into a wheel on the far side and held
his breath so it caught but then the tip of
the pole rammed the wagon bed the pole
smashing out at the struggling poler with a
hundred times his own strength it caught
his knee and threw him as if he were a mouse
flung by a catapult he went screaming off

into the dust that hid him from bills view

  jump clear jump clear shawn heard
himself yelling but he knew it was too late
only those who had jumped by instinct
could get out of the way

  he watched open mouthed while the
wagon careened down the slope visible as
only an occasional spinning wheel jutted out
of the booming dust down toward the ant-
like forms crawling up from below lie
didnt want to imagine what would happen
if that spinning hell reached the women and
children he just stood and watched and
prayed   

  beyond the dust cloud loomed a giant
wind-twisted pine the wagon took a sud-
den swerve and smashed against it and the
tree shook like a twanged bowstring as
wheels and wagon timbers seemed to spurt
in every direction then slowly the pine
tree bent then wavered for a moment and
crashed to earth   

  a damp wind came along and eased the
dust away to show the shattered wagon and
tree lying in a crumpled heap far down the
trail   

 your fault shawn what a damn
hairbrained idea why dragging wagons
up a sheer cliff could have killed us all

  bill shawn did not reply he stood by
the fire with his thumbs tucked into the
waistband of his buckskin breeches there
was no use to reply the speaker was joel
kalder he was schooled in talking and
thoroughly pleased when he got an audience
he could talk rings around shawn and
shawn knew it so he kept his silence a
reply could only give kalder something to
rip apart

  here we are eighty miles south of the
main pass kalder went on with just
barely time to make it safely across to
oregon before snow comes you call your-
self a wagon master well spend weeks
here getting half the wagons across and
ill bet its your own freight wagon youll
want to take over first shorter route you
say but by the lord above man youll
maroon us here for the winter

shawn looked around the campfire most
of the eighty people in the train were
present listening to kalder shawn stood
with feet braced and took their stares
kalder on the other side of the fire stood in
front of a wagon wheel and gestured with
over the hill to hell



long graceful hands he was a tall slender
man with quick flashing eyes that swept the
crowd and examined the result of every
word he said once he had talked of a law
practice in oregon but shawn guessed the
law was only a stop-gap in joel raiders
career the man was cut out for politics
and his dream was a white-pillared gover-
nors mansion in this new land of oregon
shawn shook his head and waited for the
onslaught to end

  but kalder was just warming up 
wantto maroon us here he said youve
probably got indian friends just wailing
for a chance to attack us- -m

  shawns shoulders stiffened he looked up
suddenly at kalder he growled shut
your damn mouth

  kalders voice rose shrilly ah so you
want to keep off that subject dont you
shawn youd rather we didnt talk about
that  thought there was a reason and
now ive got it ill bet my shirt youd take
your freight wagons across and leave us here
to the tender mercies of the indians

  in spite of the rage burning red in his
cheeks shawn felt pleased at catching
kalder admitting that they could make it
across but before shawn could voice his
reply kalder was summing up

  i ask he cried can we trust such a
man as shawn to take charge of our lives
and destinies why what do we know
about him this so-called santa fe bull-
whacker

  a womans voice called hes golten s
this far

  shawn glanced quickly her way it was
the widow hannah dailey he blushed now
from new cause everyone in the train knew
there was something between hannah and
shawn he wished hannah hadnt spoken
kalder would quickly seize the advantage
offered him

  it seems to me uh mrs dailey kalder
said that some things may not seem clear
to those of us who are-uh-under the
influence of certain others

  at that shawn was already striding
across ihe firelit circle swearing under his
breath that no ring-tailed slick-mouthed
shyster gunning for a political career could
talk that way but before anything de-
veloped a half  dozen men rose up and
lunged between him and the lawyer

  bill stopped his face red with anger he

couldnt do what he wanted twist this
lawyer into a knot kalder was no match
for him physically all his muscle was con-
centrated in his tongue

   but bill spoke his piece he did it gruffly
and loud enough so that kalder couldnt cut
in he said

  if it rains we cant cross here if it
dont rain i think we can and it gives us a
bigger chance of beatin the snows to oregon
than if we head norih those men thats got
the guts to try can give me a hand come
mornin

  hesaid that and was gone   

  later he sat with hannah dailey by her
fire after shed put her two boys to bed
hannah was some years younger than he
plump cheeked and full bosomed it was
six weeks since shed lost her husband a
very short time to be courting again they
all said shawn agreed it was so but the
trail changed many things and left other
things intact one being that hannah had
more need of a mans help than ever

  hannahs husband had died before the
train left independence she had gone any-
way to bill it had been clear from the
start that she needed more help than the
rest could offer from time to time since
he offered the most help he was around
her the most and now he had almost for-
gotten her husband the trail had that wav
about it past events were like the dust
youd roiled and left to settle behind

  you -see bill she said mr kalder
wants to be captain of the train he knows
that in oregon everyone will be so new
that theyll all have trail memories a for-
mer trail captain would look big to people
-to voters

  shawn growled he can call himself
train captain anything he wants as long as
he dont stick his nose in the way of gettin
us over this hill he nodded up into the
darkness where the glowering mass of the
mountain was a black block in the cloudy
sky he squinted at the sky and felt the air
on his neck and cheeks there was a cold
tang in it he shivered with apprehension
rather than with cold he said why dont
we make kalder commandin general of
this train or admiral thatll sound good
to the voters

  hannah laughed and her hand fell lightly
on his arm but she sobered quickly no
matter what the title he might have he

wants leadership if he hadnt joined the
train late hed have objected to your being
elected captain he wants no sham titles
he wants leadership power you see

  he shrugged

  did you know-its said that- she
whispered bit her lip added you wont
be angry bill

  what dyou mean

  its said that mr kalder started the
rockslide that broke up the men hauling on
the rope it was just behind his place on the
rope that it started you see-dont say any-
thing the person who told me is an old
gossip-

  why that-that- he began to bellow

  its just talk she cried maybe it
wasnt that-maybe your pulley arrange-
ment wasnt good enough bill maybe it
just didnt work-maybe its your fault
after all

  he rose flaming with anger at kalder
and now turning it suddenly on her he bit
back his retort and pounded angrily away

  clodfoot sodbusters he swore to him-
self

in the morning he was up before dawn
and strode up the side of the mountain to
where the pulley was still chained to the
rock outcropping there he watched the
gray waves of dawn break over the hills
by god he thought if only id taken off
with my own wagons alone we could have
run to the north crossing and made it for
sure we got better horses and wagons-
and men too

  he swore and picked up a rock he hurled
it angrily down the slope jt struck a boul-
der and bounced out into space for a second
it was silhouetted against the hulking black
cloud the new light was beginning to out-
line and then arced to earth

  now the men were coming up walking
sluggishly mistrusting their hearts and
guts wouldnt be in the job ahead but bill
shawn tried his best

  as the first man came within hearing
distance he bellowed where you headed
for friend

  oregon the man yelled back

  oregon bill shawn cried back where
in blazes is that

  over the hill friend vhe man panted

  bill bellowed oregon again and they
all took it up until it rang down the line of

ant-like struggling men their figures jerked
as they climbed lively now and clawing
away at this mountain they meant to con-
quer those on the lower slopes were running
up toward the figure of the red-haired man
with his legs wide apart braced firmly as
the mountain itself bill shawn boomed
oregons movin west fastern you are

  he took the long rope now and poked it
through the pulley he kicked the pulley and
the chain and was reassured by the heavy
clanking of iron he kicked the chain all the
way around for a faint suspicion lurked in
his mind that someone might have tampered
with it an evil suspicion but it floated in
his mind he thought a man like kalder
trying to work a whole train of people for
his own good had made him wary even
thinking such thoughts made him shiver
with fury

  it was a long wait hissnerves tingled
with impatience they came so slowly in
spite of the echoing cries of oregon the
polers careful now took their posts the
men whod heave on the spokes assembled
the rest climbed up the steep slope to where
bill shawn stood with the end of the heavy
rope clutched in his hands he walked it
down to them when they had gathered and
they swarmed over the loose end until they
looked like a swarm of bees on a dead limb
soon the rope was lost among them

  shawn went down set his wheel men in
position and checked the tie of the rope to
the wagon doubletree he glanced once at
the pine tree and the wagon wrecked the
previous afternoon then returned to the
rope and bellowed anybody know whats
across the hill	

  there was a reply but quicker than hed
expected and different it was a single mans
voice hells across that hill

  he looked up standing on the rock to
which the chain was attached was joel
kalder its going to rain soon you better
get down the hill-before you cant he
cried down to them look at those clouds
he pointed a long finger up at the sky and
they all felt the murkiness of rain wind
washing over them and saw it in the flapping
of his long-tailed coat

he cried now ill not have you all
killed on this crazy venture theres an
easy way to cross the divide and we can
easily make it before snow why tear our-

tough and defiant in his jail cell
the kid wanted only to be as brave
as his outlaw hero  who even
then was serving that young bad-
man better than either of them
knew 



 toby miles lay still in the stifling
 heat of the cell choking back the
 nausea from the wound in his thigh
 and staririg through the half-darkness at
 the old man sitting on the bunk across from
 him a single candle flickered from a niche
 in the adobe wall casting yellow light onto
 the mans pale eyes and across the flat planes
 of his face

   you aint exactly a talkative critter the
 old man said

   that can go both ways toby said
 they jailed me an hour ago and you
 havent even asked how come i stopped the
while the gallows wait-



lead so i wouldnt throw stones if i were
you

  the old man shrugged he took tobacco
fand papers from a pocket of his frayed shirt
and tossed them across to toby

  dont get riled younker he said you
dont want to palaver its all the same to
me otherwise you can call me bonner ev-
erybody does

  toby sifted tobacco dust into a paper
spilling a little on the sweat-soured blanket
beneath him what the hell he said bit-
terly youd know soon enough anyway
he lit the cigarette and sucked the harsh
dry smoke deep into his luilgs a ranny
was sleeping behind the livery i tried to
lift his gun he woke up and let out a holler
like a stuck pig

  bonners teeth were yellow in the candle
light and what would a kid like you be
needing with a hogleg

  toby let his eyes narrow he was loose-
skinned and big-boned grown hard and tall
for his age

  i figured it was a thing id need he
said unless i wanted to be a dirt farmers
flunky the rest of my life i had epough of
that mister-back on pas place near con-
norsville i cut out two weeks ago and im
never going back tonight was just a bad
break

  bonners eyes showed nothing aiming
to hit the owlhoot eh he said softly i
can tell

  toby took a final drag on the cigarette
flipped it across the cell something like
that old-timer he lay back and the sud-
den movement brought another wave of
sickness flooding through him

  he was thinking now of the wanted
dodger in the pocket of his levis there was
no need to examine the dodger again the
face of cole mallory was engraved in tobys
memory mallory-the man the whole terri-
tory feared and envied the man who had
robbed a score of banks killed almost a
dozen men the man who had savvy enough
to use his brain arid a colt-instead of a
pitchfork and a plow

  bonner slid off his bunk and moved across
the dirt floor slowly to the high barred win-
dow

  getting sort of red in the east he said
sun will be busting up over them moun-
tains any minute now daylight comes
mighty fast in these parts

  fine toby said maybe theyll feed
us

bonner laughed tonelessly maybe
he grasped the bars in wide hands and
stood there rigid a tall man with narrow
sloping shoulders and thinning iron-gray
hair

  he said a man can just begin to make
out the shape of things now funny how
you can see so many thousand mornings
come and go and never pay them no notice
toby glanced at him sharply whats so
different about this one

  bonner edged closer to the bars this is
the morning they let me out

  i wish it was nie toby said

  they wont be too hard on you son-
seeing as how you aint much more than a
button

  cut that friend toby told him cole
mallory started even younger than me
bonner laughed drily pull in your
horns he said he was silent a full minute
then you know what id do when i got
out if i was you

  go back to a damn manure fork i sup-
pose toby said

   beats a lot of other things i could name
bonner pressed his face against the bars
yonders a creek and a lot of nice rolling
land good land for farming a lad like
you could work somebody elses place until
he saved enough for one of his own he
could-

  save it toby said youre talking to
the wrong gent bonner

  maybe so im just saying that if a man
put his mind to it he could have himself a
right nice place hereabouts next thing hed
want would be a little somebody to brighten
it up for him men aint built to go it single
saddle

  toby miles said nothing bonner was
loco that was for damn sure he wondered
how long a man had to be penned up before
he got that way he changed his position
slightly the wanted dodger rustled soft-
ly in his pocket he thought again of cole
mallory

  bonner made a soft sound in his throat
mighty strange i never thought out things
myself when i was your age

  a man works hard and stays honest he
can sleep nights he dont have to grab his
shut-eve a few minutes at a time with his


fifteen western tales

fingers hooked around a gun like cole mal-
lory and the rest of his breed

  yeah toby said shortly and mai
lory dont work no sixteen hours a day-
like farmers

  thats right son but when honest folks
get up they can face anybody and keep
right on facing them all day

  toby grunted you should rent a church
and have yourself a revival

  from the corridor outside the cell came
the clang of an iron door being opened and
then the thud of approaching boots

  bonner took a deep breath let it out
slowly

  funny he said the things  can see
out yonder that creek there free- anti
pretty and running any place it pleases and
that good rolling land just waiting to be
made into something a man could be mighty
proud of something a man wouldnt ever
have to run away from but its only for
them thats smart enough to see

  the cell door swung inward four men
stood there tense and silent they did not
look at toby miles

  bonners fingers clinched the bars until
his knuckles whitened then slowly he
turned and walked toward the waiting menr
at the door he paused and for a moment his
pale eyes locked with tobys

  you ought to feel right proud son he
said quietly youre lying on the same
bunk cole mallory laid on he didnt get
off it until two hours ago thats when they
took him out and hung him his voice went
down to almost a whisper i sided cole on
his last hold-up looks like ill pretty soon
be siding him again in boothill

toby miles lay there a full minute
feeling the pounding of his heart trying
not to be sick to his stomach then his
whole body screaming against the pain- he
pushed himself off the bunk and onto the
dusty floor dragging his bullet-torn leg
behind him he inched toward the window
not trying to hold back the tears any longer
knowing only that he had to look through

that barred window that nothing else mat-
terednow

  he heard the sounds of men moving
around outside and the soft curses and short
words of men who talk only because they
have to then the muffled sound of boots
on clay changed abruptly to the louder sound
of boots on pine planks

  he clawed at the cell wall trying to pull
himself upright his fingers slipped on the
smooth adobe time and again he sank back
to the floor weak from the pain in his thigh
and the cramping nausea in his belly

  at last his lingers caught the edge of the
window he hung there a moment getting
his breath outside there was complete si-
lence-and then he heard a sharp sound a
sound very much like the crack of a drovers
whip moments later he heard the beat of
boots on planking again then on clay then
silence once more

  tight-lipped he pulled himself up the last
six inches to the level of the window

  he stood there eyes straining at- the gal-
lows at bonners body swaying there at the
end of a new yellow rope he watched the
early morning breeze stirring the old mans
gray hair the new rope creaked softly on
the pine cross beam

  there was nothing else high adobe walls
enclosed the small jail yard that held the
scaffold

  there was no jree-rnnning creek no gen-
tly rolling land-there was nothing out there
but the high adobe walls and the scaffold
and an old man who hadnt had his break-
fast swaying at the end oj a rope

  toby miles sank slowly to the floor the
pain in his thigh was now only a vague dull
ache he stared across the heat-filled room
toward the bunk where cole mallory had
lain

  numbed fingers fumbled in the pocket of
his levis and drew out the wanted dodger

  with his eyes still fixed on the empty
bunk toby miles crumpled the yellowed
paper-slowly and with deliberate care into
a small firm ball and flung it into the far
corner of the cell	go
when dodge was
wild

by john t
lynch

jim kennedy gun in hand
edged to the open window

to most of the citizens of roaring
dodge city he was the most popu-
lar mayor ever to boss that godless
end-of-trail metropolis but to jim
kennedy his honor ivas just an-
other fugitive on the muzzle-end
of a long manhunt

a dramatized
factual story

by the time jim kennedy finally
caught up with the man he had sworn
to kill on sight circumstance forced
him to change his plan not the actual kill-
ing part of it just the on sight business
because you cant just blow into a town
and shoot the mayor as you could an ordi-
nary citizen and dog kelley had become
mayor of dodge city kansas in 

for three years jim kennedy had been
tracking down his enemy

up through texas all over colorado ne-




fifteen western tales

braska and missouri kennedy bad followed
the dim trail of the man he had originally
known as pitch willser but pitch had
changed his course as often as he had
changed his name so finding him had been
far from easy sometimes kennedy would
reach a place where willser had recently
been known other times he would lose
months in again picking up the trail not
that pitch knew he was being tracked down
by kennedy he thought kennedy was
dead

  it had been one moonlit night in 
down in the texas panhandle that kennedy
and willser had teamed up to rob a treasure
laden stage the holdup had been scotched
by an alert and quick acting shot gun mes-
senger who had succeeded in firing three
bullets into kennedy and one into willsers
right arm the stagecoach hadnt even
paused in the dust it kicked up as it rat-
tled on by the woukl-be and now wounded
road agents willser took one dim look at
his partner reached down and rolled him
over decided kennedy was very dead and
departed

  when the posse arrived on the scene of
the attempted holdup they found jim ken-
nedy lying in the road it took a close
examination to learn that he was still breath-
ing despite what looked like fatal wounds
taken into the nearest town he was first
doctored up then jailed recovering with
amazing speed kennedy was tried and sen-
tenced to spend the next six months in the
local jail good behavior and his pleasant
personality got him off in two months tt
was then that he swore to find the man who
had deserted him and kill him on sight

  without a system without a plan kenne-
dy set off to track pitch willser down all
he could do he knew was to go to as many
places as possible and wander around ask-
ing questions and keeping his eves and ears
open his wanderings got him close to his
quarry several times but not until he
reached dodge city did he finally see will-
ser it was at this first astounding sight that
jim kennedy realized he would have to be
patient 

  jim kennedy arrived in dodge city on the
fourth of july already he noted the
townsfolk were lining the edges of the main
street waiting for the parade to come along
jim took the opportunity to scan as many
faces as possible in the crowd always hop-

ing that one of them would be the hated
face of willser

  the parade came blaring along the fire-
mens brass band led the gala procession
right- behind them paraded a fancily deco-
rated buggy new and shiny pulled by a
pair of matched show horses in the buggy
one man sat and held the reins while the
other in high silk hat and frock coat bowed
and smiled to the spectators

  kennedy too busy scanning the faces of
the crowd to pay attention to the bowing
and smiling official in the buggy merely
gave a quick glance toward the passing vehi-
cle not until he resumed inspecting the
faces of the spectators did something regis-
ter in kennedys mind he gasped and
looked again at the silk hatted gent in the
buggy the man everybody was cheering
as our mayor

  our mayor now known as dog kelley
was pitch willser from planning for so
long to draw his sixgun and shoot at first
sight of his enemy jim reached for his
gun reason returned and he thought bet-
ter of the move one look at these folks told
him that they would not care to have their
beloved mayor shot dead-especially on
this great day and jim kennedy had often
heard-as had the rest of the country-that
dodge city people were quick to resent
strangers who were too hasty in reaching
for guns after youd lived around there
for a while of course you could use your
own judgment

within the next few weeks jim kenne-
dy had made a few friends and was able
to ask questions he learned that dog kel-
ley had been living in dodge city as a
store-owner and then as mayor for about
two years dog was popular and well thought
of by most of the citizens dog kelley was
in fact the most beloved person in dodge
aside from dora hand

  and who is this dora hand asked jim
kennedy

  the queen of all the dance hall girls
came the answer dora is loved and re-
spected by everybody in spite of her sing-
ing and dancing in ham bells variety hall
kven the married women in town will asso-
ciate with her because they know shes de-
cent and does a lot of kind things around
here nurses the sick helps the poor-
things like that
when dodge was wild



  that night kennedy went to ham bells
combination saloon and theater to see with
his own eyes this paragon of the dance hall
women dora hand jim had been around
long enough to be skeptical about the pure-
ness and decency of any dance hall dames
there were he knew many who were moral-
ly above reproach-but they were still very
much in the minority and he couldnt re-
member ever before seeing one it was with
avid interest that he watched dora hand
come out on the stage and start to sing her
sentimental ballads

  kennedy accustomed to the hoarse whis-
key soprano voices of most variety hall lady
singers was first surprised to hear that dora
hand had a truly beautiful and refined voice
at the same time he noticed that the lady
looked as beautiful as she sang

  within five minutes jim kennedy had
like most others in dodge fallen in love
with dora hand but unlike most-who
loved her from a distance only-jim decided
to do something about it

  between acts he went to one of the bar-
tenders gave him a tip and asked how
can i get introduced to dora hand

  the bar man laughed all strangers ask
that just introduce yourself like you do
any dance hall girl

  but she aint just any dance hall girl
she is in a class by herself-

  thats right said the bartender but
you tipped me now let me tip you-dont
try to get too friendly with dora the
mayor wont like it

  you mean pitch-er i mean dog kelley
wont like it why

  because lies been making a play for her
for a long time he aint gettin very far
but he resents anybody else tryin to horn
in kind of figgers she is private property
maybe

  on hearing this jim kennedy decided to
wait no longer lo kill mayor dog kelley
the very thought of such a man making a
play for such a lovely woman was enough
to edge jim into his grim decision-even
though he had not yet so much as been

within twenty yards of the saloon lady

  still playing his hand slowly and patient-
ly jim permitted five days to go by before
putting his lethal plan into effect meantime
he learned that the mayor lived in a nice
three-room house on the outskirts of town
he even ascertained which room the mayor
used to sleep in and found it was the center
one right across the room from the middle
side window

  not necessarily wishing to kill anybody
under such sneaking circumstances jim
kennedy salved his conscience by telling
himself that in this case there was no other
way dog had too many friends in town
also it wasnt just for revenge that the kill-
ing would be done it was to protect the
lovely dora hand from marrying such a
crook as kelley-a man who would run
away and leave a pal for dead in order to
save his own skin

  during his entire stay in dodge city jim
had kept out of the mayors sight this was
easy to do once he learned which saloons the
mayor preferred these he kept away from
even in the variety hall where both the
mayor and kennedy went to see doras act
kennedy always was careful not to come
into dogs line of sight kelley never knew
that jim was in town

  after three nights of going over the
ground secretly and laying his-final plans
jim decided to act

  it was shortly after midnight pitch black
on the edge of town when kennedy made
his way unseen to the house of the mayor
quietly sneaking around the side of the
house on which was the bedroom window
jim kennedy gun in hand edged up to the
open window dimly he could make out the
bed on the far side of the room bringing
up his sixgun jim fired four shots into the
lumpy part of the bed coverings that told
him his quarry was there as quietly and
surreptitiously as he had come jim kennedy
made his way back to town satisfied with
his nights work he went to his room in the
hotel anti went to sleep his long search
was over the mission of three years stand-


fifteen western tales

lng had been accomplished and he had
saved a good woman from a bad man   
but thered be hell poppin in the morning
when the folks found their beloved mayor
dead as hell in his bed

jim kennedy slept late the following
morning by the time he reached his
favorite hangout the lone branch saloon
he realized that the evident grief of the
people gathered along the streets in large
and small groups was more than hr had
bargained for even the men in he lena
branch seemed undidv sad about the pass-
ing of one dog kelley there were tears
coursing down the weathered cheeks of the
bartender

  whats everybody so gloomy about
asked jim kennedy somebody kick the
bucket

  the barman nodded silently

  must be somebody prominent said
kennedy playing it cagy

  it was somebody real prominent sniffed
the bartender we all loved her too there
wasnt nothin we wouldnt have done for
her she was so good to everybody-
kennedy stiffened her what dyoti
mean--her you mean him dont you
no-her dora hand was murdered in
bed last night poor dora

  kennedy braced himself he knew the
answer before he asked what the hell you
talkin about it was the mayor-

  no said the bar man he was too grief
stricken to realize the slin jim had just made
it was dora hand the bullets was prob-
ably meant for the mayor because nobody
would want to kill dora but dora was
sleepin in the mayors bed-

  did she always sleep in-

  no the barman shouted it aint what
youre think in see at the hotel where
dora lived thay been paintin and fixin up
her room to make it suit such a pretty wom-
an meantime dora had to have a place to
sleep well the mayor had to go to omaha
for several days he left yesterday so as
long as his house was vacant he told dora
to use his bed while he was away-until
her room was ready for her 

  kennedy in a horrified daze had heard
enough the enormity of his crime weighing
heavily upon him he plodded around town
until he found bat masterson calling bat
aside he said to the famous lawman bat

i want you to shoot me dead right here
right now

masterson always a cool head said sim-
mer down sonny i got enough trouble
here this morning whats wrong with you
quietly then jim kennedy told bat mas-
terson the entire story

  at this point bat masterson made one of
those highly original derisions for which he
was famous son he said these folks
would ivnch you right off the minute the
news was out

   then tell them i kilrd dora said jim
i deserve to die let them string me up
pronto

  bat shook his head wouldnt do no
good either wav i dont hold with lynchins
at all and they wouldnt let us hold you
for a trial you sure did wrong-but it
wasnt a deliberate killing now you go to
thr liverv barn gpt your horse and light
rut of town go bsck to texas this thing
ic just between you and m this wav itll
save touble all around now be a good feller
-and git

   but i want to die persisted kennedy
i killed dora-and i loved her

   maybe dvin would be loo good for you
son said bat youll be payin penally
enough just by thinkin what an awful thing
you done gil your horse and git out afore
i change my mind

   masterson went along to the livery stable
and waited while jim saddled up then he
rode to the outskirts of town and watched
kennedy disappear down the trail

   two days later a farmer bringing vegeta-
bles into market stopped his team on the
road and scrambled down a small hill to
gel a drink of cool water from a little stream
about three miles from dodge city but
he didnt get the drink lying in the water
was ihe body of jim kennedy he had shot
himself through the head a clear case of
suicide

   bat masterson brought to light the fact
that the whole thing might have been a
tragedy of error mayor kelley emphati-
cally denied that he had ever been known
at pitch willser and claimed he had never
seen jim kennedy before

   not only that insisted lhe mayor but
i absolutely never held up a stagecoach  
he was silent for a moment then added
thoughtfully in texas that is o o o

under the title manhunt

they found a horse with a three 
brand at the mouth of rawhide can
yon and because the horse was dead
they knew that clint farley had failed in
his desperate bid for freedom they knew
that they had run farley down that the
drama begun some two hours before-when
farley had shot his way from the saddle
rock jail-would end somewhere within the
towering walls of the rawhide

  mocking walls they must have seemed to

fifteen western tales

theater rimmed with stone no man willing-
ly would flee into such a place but for
farley afoot with a posse thundering close
behind there had been no choice

  sheriff leonard lean and melancholy
with drooping sandy moustache pointed out
the obvious fact to the members of his posse
standing by the three s horse dead with a
bullet through the brain the sheriff looked
down at ground marked by various little
signs which were like so many printed words

  hoss broke its leg he drawled so
clint piled up in that clump o sagebrush
yonder clint must have killed the hoss and
headed up rawhide afoot musta been
jolted some by the fall he never even
stopped to get his hat

  the hat a battered black sombrero was
half hidden by the brush sunlight gleamed
on metal and the sheriff stooped and picked
a silver dollar from the dirt he held it in
his hand clint wont be needin this he
mused and put the dollar in his pocket

  he wont need anything-after today
said jim blaney slowly

  the old sheriffs glnce caught momentar-
ily on the lean dark face of the big cross l
man jim blaney and jess mccaulley had
been partners in the ownership of the cross
l spread clint farley hiding now some-
where within the canyon had been con-
vinced and sentenced to life in the pen for
the murder of jess mccaulley blaney had
been chief witness for the state at the trial

  from blaney the sheriffs gaze went slow-
ly over the faces of those other men caught
up in the hasty loop with which he had gath-
ered his posse hugh miller proprietor of
the livery stable in town small slightly
built known for courage anse larson of
the box m crabby cantankerous incor-
ruptible larsons lean-flanked son art ed
siminole rider for the cross l who had
beenanother witness at farleys trial riley
hatch square-faced square-bodied bronco
twister and so at last the sheriffs eyes
came to rest on the grim face of sam fen-
ton his deputy

  perhaps then the sheriff was remember-
ing that fenton and clint farley had once
been close friends perhaps he was won-
dering how the deputy felt about this job of
hunting down a man who had been his part-
ner for his eyes dwelt long on fentons face
but he turned at last to study the frowning
walls of the canyon

  you gents all knew clint farley he said
slowly you know having gone this far
clints likely to go all the way hes some-
where in the canyon and i aim to get him
ten to one clint will elect to shoot it out

  he waited no man spoke they knew
clint farley-all of them they knew the
recklessness of the man they trailed the
devil-may-care quality of his courage and
every man there knew that farley would
fight until the end and go out smiling if it
so suited him

  he heaved up the crick bed continued
sheriff leonard which doesnt mean a
thin hes smart enough to quit the crick
without a track and hes nervy enough to
double back an steal our horses for a get-
away well leave anse with the horses
he can watch the opening in case clint tries
to double back the rest of us willgo on in
afoot weve got to round him up before
dark

  that was true enough and here and there
a head nodded at the sheriffs wisdom

  on the sheer cliffs which rim rawhide
canyon are seams by which a man willing
to gamble his neck might reach the top
by daylight this opportunity was denied
the fugitive for the trap would be long and
slow and would leave him exposed to rifle
fire from any point within the canyon but
it clint farley could keep hidden until dark
or if he could hold the posse off   

sam fenton big shouldered raw-
boned deputy listened with half an ear
to the careful last instructions of the sheriff
they would spread out in a line to sweep
the canyon three men to one side of the dry
creek bed three men to the other they
would move on slowly keeping in touch
when possible they would watch for tracks
   and then sam fentons thoughts strayed
off and the dry voice of the sheriff was no
more than a blur

  it was queer clint farley was a con-
victed murderer and he sam fenton was a
deputy sheriff tracking the escaped man
down so that the state might exact jull pay-
ment for the crime yet once they had been
friends and partners they had owned a
ranch together and the beginnings of a
brand but three years of hard luck had
left them broke and other things had broken
their friendship there had been an ugly
fist fight and for two years or longer he had
not spoken a single word to clint farley

  but sam fenton could find no joy in the
task which faced him now

  the sheriffs voice cut through the thick
shell of his thoughts fenton you and
blaney and seminole can take the north
slope art larson and riley and me will
take the other mind what i say-go easy

i	liked clint farley once and id rather
take him in alive but hes on the wrong side
in this deal dont take no chances with
him

  they started they moved forward in a
ragged skirmish line that would sweep the
canyon clean from end to end no chance
for farley to slip past that outspread line
no chance for him to evade discovery sam
fenton moved mechanically along the steep
slope a carbine in his hand below a hun-
dred feet or so was blaney above an equal
distance was ed seminole creeping for-
ward slowly taking advantage of every bit
of cover which lined the hillside closing in
on a desperate dangerous man crossing
gulleys torn by spring freshets swinging
around rocks crouching to study the wooded
slope ahead to listen for the chance sound
which might betray the fugitive then
moving again   

  fenton shook his head he and clint
farley had been partners once and now he
was creeping in to slip a noose about far-
leys neck a deputy sheriff sworn to up-
hold the law and yet before farley had
ever gone to trial he had tried to mend the
breach between them he had gone to far-
ley offering help-and farley had told him
curtly to go to hell

  the sun beat down out of a sky that was
like a brazen bowl the rocks were hot
beneath the big deputys hands as he moved
forward keeping in position in that slowly
advancing line below blaney had been
swallowed up by the thick growth of the
hillside he caught a glimpse of seminole
sliding shadow-swift between clumps of
scrub oak a third of the big box canyons
had been covered he dropped into a gulley
circling a tumbled mass of rock wher a
great chunk of stone had once crashed from
the wall of the cliff

   and a voice spoke softly close beside him
hold it fenton reach for the sky

  not six feet away in a bellow in the
rocks with a ten-foot high cut-bank at his
back squatted farley there was a sneer

on farleys lips in his left hand was a rifle
in his right a six-gun which hung level in
line with big sam fentons chest

  collecting some blood money fenton
the deputy came erect standing there
right hand still gripping his carbine he
studied out of pitying eyes the man who had
been his partner the man had aged
changed he was like a savage animal at
bay his hat was gone one cheek was
scratched and his face was streaked with
blood and dirt his bloodshot eyes glared

clint said fenton slowly you better
drop that gun and come on back with me
not in a million years rasped clint
farley go to the pen for something i
didnt do-

  and suddenly standing there the deputy
was glad that the thing had turned this way
he was glad that farley had the drop on
him that positions were not reversed he
had not planned it so but for facing that
desperate driven man sam fenton knew he
did not want to be the one to take clint
farley back to jail now the responsibility
had been lifted from him in the face of that
levelled gun he was helpless yet there was
duty-

  clint he pointed out you havent got
a chance this canyons full of men theyll
get you certain sure

  farley grinned mirthlessly not alive
they wont and its better than going to
the pen

  for a moment sam fenton forgot the
gun that was pointing at his breast his
mind flashed back to remembered facts in
the case which had ended with clint far-
leys conviction on a murder charge

  convinced of farleys guilt the big dep-
uty had been glad when a job in the lower
county had kept him from the trial but he
was acquainted with the evidence which had
gone to convict the map damning enough
in all truth that evidence had been

  jess mccaulley half-owner of the cross
l had been found dead at the gate leading
in his ranch-house his gun had been in hol-
ster so that it seemed that mccaulley must
have been shot down in cold blood beneath
the dead mans hand the name farley had
been spelled out in the soft dust of the road
because of the enmity which had existed be-
tween the two and because farley was the
last man known to have seen mccaulley
alive the name written in the dust had been


fifteen western tales

a powerful argument for the prosecution

  nor had clint farley at his trial denied
that he had visited the cross l man shortly
before he was killed denial would have
been useless anyhow for jim blaney mc-
caulleys partner in the cross l and ed
seminole a puncher for the outfit had met
farley as he rode away from the cross l
riding on they had found jess mccaullev
dead beside the gate so they had testified
at the trial

  accepting the evidence at face value sam
fenton had taken for granted the guilt of
the man who once had been his partner
now looking into farleys blood-shot glar-
ing eyes the deputy remembered that far-
ley throughout the trial had steadfastly
maintained that he was innocent of the mur-
der clint farley had been plenty wild he
had drunk too much gambled too much but
he had never been a liar   

  clint said fenton suddenly you got
no chance to get away this canyons bot-
tled tighter than a drum give me your gun
if you didnt kill jess mccaullev i give you
my word ill never quit until i clear you

  the fugitives lips curled back in a sav-
age mocking grin go to hell  he snapped
i want no favors from you-now or ever
you and me got all our business caught up
long ago you whipped me once but this
time i got the drop cut loose your gun
belt

  theyll get you clint you got no
chance

  let em farley was snarling now i
wont go to the pen unhook that belt id
hate to have to drill you

he had taken his stand in a hollow in
the rocks at the gulleys edge with the
ten-foot high cutbank behind him now
suddenly watching that passion-torn face
sam fenton caught his breath at the edge
of the cut-bank behind farley appeared the
face the figure of a man jim blaney

  and a great wave of relief swept over
fenton then for he saw that they would be
able to take farley in alive covered by
farleys gun he watched dispassionately
while blaney leaned far out over the bank
he watched the six-gun level in the big
mans hand he waited for the crisp com-
mand that would end the situation

  clint farley moved impatiently damn
you unloose that gun belt he snapped his

gun lifted menacingly i wont tell you
again

  still blaney did not announce himself
leaning far out over the bank gun poised
in his hand he still delayed the sharp com-
mand that would make farley prisoner

  then all at once sam fenton realized
that there would be no command there
would be no word of warning for the man
who covered from behind blaneys face
was a dark mask of hatred and his mouth
was set in a cruel line he was going to
shoot clint farley in the back his thumb
was on the hammer-

  no time then for fenton to shout a
wanvng hardly time for thought swifter
than thought was the deputy in action
ignoring farleys gun leveled at his breast
the deputy stabbed for his colt the gun
came up spouting blaney the avenger
smashed off balance by the slug let the gun
slip from his fingers and stumbled at the
very edge of the bank he grasped desper-
ately for a handhold as he tottered then
tripped and pitched head foremost into the
guiley blaney threw out an unavailing
arm in the instant before his head struck
against a rock then the big cross l man
lay quiet and still

  farley had spun around as blaney fell
now he looked at the deputy a long mo-
ment of silence and sam fenton spoke
grinilv he was going to plug you in the
back

  i had a dead -drop said clint farley
and there was a queer look in his eyes you
went for your gun you knew you was
taking chances why did you do it sam
sam fenton grinned at him you didnt
know blaney was there he said you
must have figured i was drawing down on
you why didnt you shoot clint

  they studied each other in that sun-
drenched hillside slowly clint farley shook
his head let it go sam im obliged
he dropped his colt into the holster call
the sheriff and lets get back to town
sam fenton stooped and turned the un-
conscious blaney on his back there was a
bump on the cross l mans forehead where
he had brought up against the rock blood
was slowly blotting out the color on the
right sleeve of blaneys shirt the deputy
slit the sleeve folded it back his hasty
shot had torn a jagged hole through blaneys
upper arm with a bandage he stopped the
bring him back dead



flow of blood frowning he regarded the
bare smooth-muscled arm of the cross l
man

  across blaneys forearm still faintly pink
was the welt of a freshly healed scar a scar
that must have been burned there by a bul-
let for a moment he looked at the scar
with thoughtful eyes but when at last he
spoke it was about another matter altogeth-
er

  he meant to drill you in the back clint
he muttered that sorts peculiar did he
have anything agin you personal i
mean

  ive had plenty of trouble with the cross
l outfit ever since i homesteaded next to
them said clint farley slowly blaney
and mccaulley both blaney and me had a
fight six months or so ago i took a gun
from him and whipped him all over a cor-
ral he seemed kinda provoked about it at
the time

  he was the gent who found mccaulley

  farley nodded him and ed seminole

  how do you and seminole stack up

  jest a drinking acquaintance why

  but sam fenton shook his head a hunch
was troubling the big deputy now-a queer
hunch that he was not willing to try to put
in words on the day following the killing
of jess mccaulley sam fenton had gone in-
to the little saddle rock bank on business
jim blaney had been standing at the cash-
iers window when he entered and fenton
had waited at blaneys elbow while the
cross l man scrawled off a check and a
little fact meaningless then and unimpor-
tant had lodged in a corner of fentons
mind-a little fact forgotten until now for
blaney writing had moved his hand in
slow and careful strokes so a man with a
sore arm might write

now crouching in a gulley in rawhide
canyon sam fenton was adding up the
score always heretofore he had assumed
that clint farley had killed jess mccaulley
now he was not sure on jim blaneys arm
was a fresh scar that must be a bullet burn
blaney had been troubled with a sore arm
on the day after his partner was found mur-
dered sam fenton lifted puzzled eyes to
clint farley fugitive from justice hunkered
there beside him

  clint he said i never got to take in
your trial there was one thing i remember

hearing which seemed funny at the time
way i heard it the testimony was that mc-
caulleys gun was in the holster but that it
had two empty shells

  that was the how of it agreed farley
a normal thoughtful gent carries an
empty to cradle his firing pin mused fen-
ton only a plumb careless hombre would
have two empty shells in his gun an jess
mccaulley was never careless

  which tallies up to how much

  clint said the deputy deadly serious
now mebbe jess mccaulley died with the
gun in his hand-might be he even got in a
shot before he died that would account for
the empty shell mebbe the gent what killed
him put the gun back in the holster and
then knowin you and mccaulley had trou-
ble wrote your name there in the dust
clint farley nodded agreement i fig-
ger something like that happened but you
cant make a jury believe that kind of story
not without knowing who killed mccaulley
or having some sort of proof to back up the
yarn

  and that was true the evidence which
had convicted farley while wholly circum-
stantial was yet so strong that absolute
proof would be required to overthrow it
sam fenton recognized that fact two men
had furnished the evidence one of these
was now lying unconscious at his feet the
other ed seminole was still somewhere
higher up on the steep side of the canyon

  a hunch was prodding the big deputy
now the time was short blaney was still
unconscious but he might recover at any
moment other members of the posse might
appear drawn by the single shot sam fen-
ton did not want that to happen-not yet
he had a plan a wildly fantastic utterly
hare-brained plan

  lifting his head carefully above the mass
of rocks he searched the hillside at the place
where last he had seen seminole it was
some little time before he found his man
seminole made cautious by the revolver
shot crouched in the shadow of a great
pinon tree but even as fenton spotted him
the cross l man began a slow advance on
hands and knees he was evidently taking
no unnecessary chances he reached a small
boulder in his path crouched there to re-
connoiter

  sam fenton completely hidden from
seminoles view by the depression in which


fifteen western tales

he stood picked up his rifle clint farley
watched him with puzzled eyes the deputy
thrust the rifle barrel between two rocks and
glanced at farley

  this aint accordin to hoyle he mut-
tered but i never did like seminole no-
how

  a dead shot with rifle or revolver he
squinted along the sights seminoles high-
crowned white stetson appeared above the
boulder as the cross l man scanned the ter-
ritory before him slowly fenton tightened
the pressure on the trigger the rifle barked
the white stetson leaped in a little arc as
though jerked by a string

  clint farleys face was a study in amaze-
ment as the deputy flipped a fresh shell into
the chamber seminole had dropped from
sight behind the boulder unfortunately for
the puncher the boulder he had selected was
not quite large enough to offer complete pro-
tection one boot projected again sam
fenton fired the boot twitched slightly
disappeared from view

  then a grim smile curving his lips the
big deputy emptied the magazine in a hail
of lead which spattered above the stone
sheltering the hapless seminole the rock
offered protection of a sort nothing more
no chance for seminole to return the fire
without exposing himself to that deadly
fusillade lead slugs flattened against the
rock kicked up dust along its edges plucked
at bits of clothing shown by the unhappy
puncher the high-walled cliffs sent back
rolling echoes of the gun-fire

  the magazine was empty sam fenton
looked at blaney the man was still uncon-
scious grinning at the puzzled farley the
big deputy filled the magazine and returned
to the bombardment spacing his shots fir-
ing with sure accuracy again he emptied the
rifle

  in the direness of his need seminole con-
trived to make the boulder shelter him he
did not offer to return the fire he was play-
ing dead wise enough under the circum-
stances for he knew that presently other
members of the posse would be coming to his
aid likewise sam fenton knew it

  he turned to farley slip down the gal-
ley clint he suggested theres some
brush down there where you can hide im
going to make peace with seminole and i
want you out of sight

  sam murmured farley this heat has

fried your brain what fool crazy notion-
get outa sight before i take a shot at
you said fenton i got me a scheme
sorrowfully farley shook his head but he
dropped down the gulley to disappear from
sight behind a clump of brush the deputy
watched until he was gone then he lifted
his voice to a bellow

  ho seminole

  and seminole answered hoarsely what
in hell yuh want 

  i got him seminole called fenton he
stood up facing the man who still crouched
behind the rock after a moment seminole
came warily to his feet

the cross l mans head was bare there
was a bloody smear across his face where
a splinter of rock had torn his cheek one
boot heel had been shot away he stooped
to pick up the white stetson then came for-
ward scowling

  mister he said as he drew near im
right damn glad yuh showed that buzzard
made this canyon plenty hot tor me shot
my damn hat off

  he came on limping slightly dragging his
rifle he reached the edge of the gulley so
that he could look down into the rocks
slowly the scowl upon his face was blotted
out and incredulity took its place

  thats blaney he cried what the
hell wheres farley

sam fenton shrugged thats blaney
hes all i bagged so far funny eh you
an him blazing away at each other-
there was a queer expression on ed
seminoles face as he looked down at the
unconscious man yuh mean to tell me-
he began angrily yuh mean to say-
sam fenton tried to explain shucks
he said soothingly he thought you was
farley an you thought he was farley
hell rasped seminole he knew
damn well i wasnt farley i was behind
him he shot my hat off-an farley never
had no hat-

  you must be wrong seminole sam
fentons voice was soft that dont tally
up why would blaney shoot at you if it
wasnt a mistake

  why seminoles face was venomous
ill tell yuh why because he owes me a
thousand dollars an he figgered to pay it
off in lead he thought-

  another voice interrupted jim blaneys
bring him back dead



voice whats wrong he asked groggily

  blaney was lifting an arm to shield his
face from the sun a patch of blood showed
on his forehead and his eyes were dazed as
he looked up at the two men seminole
glared down at him

  whats wrong- he jeered yore little
plan miscarried thats all yuh figgered it
cheaper to kill me off than pay me off safer
too nobody would be left to know that
yuh killed jess mccaulley an farley
would get the blame

  and jim blaney stared up at that furious
man with slowly comprehending glance
painfully the big cross l man lifted him-
self to a sitting position his dark face
twitched as he turned his glance momentar-
ily from seminole to sam fenton smart
he said smart as hell

  he was unarmed the deputy had
knocked the six-gun from his hand and now
his holster was empty he sat there on the
ground looking up at seminole

  yuhve said enough now seminole
enough rasped seminole yuhre
wrong blaney wait till i tell the story in
court wait till i tell a jury how yuh
cheated jess mccaulley-an killed him
when he found yuh out an offered me a
thousand dollars to testify he was dead

  slowly painfully jim blaney got to his
feet he was unarmed he had been tricked
and he knew it but he could not know the
manner by which it had been accomplished
a thin smile twisted his lips

  i promised you a thousand dollars he
repeated softly then suddenly swiftly he
moved his left hand snaked a hide-out gun
for an instant he stood still gun balanced
yuh yellow rat he snarled ill pay yuh
off-in full

  he fired the slug sent seminole reeling
backward hands clutching empty air he
threw another bullet at the swaying man
and seminole went down

  sam fentons colt leaped from his hol-
ster blaney whirled on him but fentons
gun was belching lead a brace of slugs
caught the cross l man at the belt line he
staggered back the gun slipped from his
fingers clint farley colt uplifted rushed
up the gulley just as blaney went down

  sam fenton bent above seminole the
man had been hit twice and hard but he
grinned faintly at the deputy im all
eight he whispered ill live-long

 enough he tried to raise himself up
 clint farley said heres the sheriff
 take it easy seminole said fenton
 gently blaneys outa the jurisdiction of
 the court now he straightened looked at
 farley that clears you clint

 clint nodded for the second time ta
 day sam im obliged

 forget it said the big deputy don
 say anything seminole is all right let him
 tell the story the way he knows it because
 sure as hell if sheriff leonard ever hears
 the truth of this affair ill be punching cows
 again

steve had icaited two years for the

and start stalking him

of the paradise just beyond the

listened to the excited babble of voices that

ing in there about his coming fight with

by jonathan craic


gun-meeting at midnight



con pardee he knew comparing his gun-
speed with pardees making bets on the
man they thought would walk away alive
and though he couldnt make out individ-
ual words steve jordan knew that most of
the bets would be on pardee

  con pardee had ridden into fever wells
late that afternoon and since that time the
hell-roaring railhead town had talked of
nothing else the town loved a fight like
this the meeting of two quick-draw artists
like con pardee and steve jordan pardee
whose specialty it was to let an opponent
clear leather before going into his own
lightning draw and killing him and jor-
dan the hated lawman the town-tamer
whose reputation stretched back to dodge
and abilene whose guns had met and beat
the best

  steve a tall man thinner than most
with eyes old beyond his years pushed
away from the front of the paradise and
shouldered through the batwings

   an instant hush came over the paradise
all motion was suspended it was a small
place hangout for hardcases nhddle tramps
and percentage girls cast off by other
saloons

   he moved across the sawdust to the bar
a space opened up for him as it always
did they bated him but beneath the hate
lay their fear and they paid him the respect
due his reputation

   the barkeep set bottle and glass before
him and moved away steve poured a
drink sipped it slowly thinking this drink
must be his last-until after the fight or
maybe simply his last drink after a mo-
ment the piano started up again and talk
along the bar was resumed but the talk
was quieter now most of it in careful whis-
pers

  the man beside steve said evening
marshal

  steve nodded evening lou he
knew the man well-a man dying of con-
sumption a soured bitter man who liked
nothing better than to taunt other men

knowing his sickness was protection from
both fists and guns steve cursed softly
wishing hed picked another place at the
bar

  i reckon youll be drinking light to-
night marshal lou said loudly enough
to carry the length of the crowded bar

  the murmur of voices stopped again and
steve knew they were listening enjoying
this he said nothing

  i reckon a man facing up to con pardee
would want all his wits about him lou
said thoughtfully folks say lies even
faster than you are marshal

  folks talk a lot steve said quietly
you especially

  they do for a fact lou said they
even say you got con sent to the pen just
sos youd have a clear field with iris man-
ning mind you i couldnt much blame
you that iris is about the prettiest little
baggage to hit this town in-

  shut up steve told him not raising
his voice youve said about enough
but he knew he was bluffing he couldnt
hit a lunger a dying man he glanced at
the leering mocking faces in the yellowed
bar mirror and then back at his drink

  dont get riled lou said you had
a job to do being marshal and all you
was the only witness to that little trouble
con had you swore he shot that gent
down in cold blood and thats good enough
for me

  theres a limit steve said youre
pushing it pretty hard lou

  lou pretended not to hear his voice
grew louder

  guess that judge wasnt none too sure
though he gave con a mighty short term
he coughed into a handkerchief even so
con got out a heap quicker than most of us
figured he would two years course he
got time off for behaving himself he
shook his head sadly damn shame hell
have to go right back for killing another
man

  shut up steve said again


fifteen western tales

  two years is either a short time or a
long time lou said depends on wheth-
er youre courting a pretty girl like iris-
or rotting in the pen and thinking about
somebody else courting her but dont get
me wrong marshal i think you done right
no matter what everybody else thinks he
tittered confident in his immunity

  steve put his drink down slowly feeling
the angry knotting of the hard muscles
across his shoulders he took a deep breath
let it out slowly staring hard at the death-
flushed cheeks of the lunger-and then he
turned and strode out of the paradise no
laughter followed him but he knew it
would come as soon as they were sure he
was out of earshot

ue pushed through the saturday
night crowds that surged in both di-
rections along the flare-lit boardwalk walk-
ing as rapidly as he could past the keeno
bar the bank lairds feed store thejrli-
lo-jack the nugget the granada the
den the unique cafe the blue chip-and
then he crossed the dust-filled ruts of main
street and paused a moment before the
screen door of iris mannings millinery
shop

  she was alone in her shop balanced pre-
cariously on a chair while she reached high
above her head to put a box on the top
shelf her soft blonde hair was caught at
the nape of her neck with a wisp of yellow
ribbon the tip of a tiny pink tongue came
out to touch her upper lip as she struggled
to push the box back farther on the shelf
nothing iris could do steve reflected
could ever disguise the lush beauty of her
young body just now standing on tip-toe
sideways to him she presented a picture
that helped to wash the turmoil and anger
from his mind she wasnt even trying to
conceal her curves tonight and the bright
dress she wore hugged her narrow waist
and swelling hips so snugly that steve won-
dered it didnt burst

  he opened the screen and closed it quiet-

ly behind him and took a step toward her
hello iris he said

  his voice startled her she gasped and
grabbed futilely at the shelf as the chair
wobbled beneath her

  he sprang forward catching her just as
the chair skidded away for an instant she
was a soft warm whirl of flaring skirts and
slim silken legs in his arms-and then she
wriggled loose and slid to her feet

  close steve said

  she smiled up at him steve you
frightened me but the smile was short-
lived and suddenly the green eyes were
cloudy he knew she was thinking about it
too about the gun fight-about con par-
dee he reached out and caught her in the
loose circle of his arms and she stood there
looking up at him trying to smile again
somehow holding her for what might be
the last time was like holding her for the
first time everything seemed clearer more
intense than it had in two years and she
was even more beautiful now than she had
been then honey blonde hair and warm
green eyes and a body that made a man
hurt just to look at it he wished he could
prolong this moment stretch it out through
eternity he breathed in the delicate scent
of her and suddenly he wanted to take her
and ride a thousand miles away from fever
wells and con pardee    ride away and
never even look back over his shoulder

he said i reckon youve seen con
she nodded not meeting his eyes now
they came out then the words he had
determined not to utter you never got
over him did you iris

  her wide-set eyes came up slowly and
they held an expression he had never seen
there before

  steve i  i just dont know

  its been two years iris

  she-moistened her full lips yes
  thats a long time

  yes

  time enough for a woman to decide
  she came close to him and her hands
gun-meeting at midnight



went up to press down on his shoulders

  i want to be honest steve with you
and with myself-and with con

  thats woman talk steve said quietly
it doesnt say anything

  he heard her sharp intake of breath and
felt her stiffen in his arms

  steve please be fair

  she was on the verge of tears he knew
but something deep inside him goaded him
on something born of his sickness and
hunger for her and the nearness of death

  fair he tried to choke back his bit-
ter laughter and could not fair jris is
it fair to keep a man waiting two years
she pushed his arms away from her
stood quite still before him please try to
understand steve

  i understand all right he said its
a little late but  understand you were
just marking time with me while you
waited for con

  steve

  its true admit it

  no its not true

  you said youd never got over con

  i didnt say that i-

  he laughed shortly and all the time
you knew i was putting damn near every
dollar i earned into the old frazee place
you didnt figure  aimed to live there
alone did you iris

  steve youve got to listen to me
sure he said ill listen ill listen
real hard for about ten minutes then
ive got to go out in the street and play
games with con pardee he sent word
from the inferno that hed meet me in front
of there at midnight i dont mean to keep
him waiting

she clasped her hands in front of her so
tightly that the knuckles showed white

  steve you cant go through with it
you and con were friends once how can
you-why must you want to kill each
other

why because it has to be cons fast-
er than i am iris you dont have to worry

much ill be the one to die not con
oh steve you twist everything i say
around to please yourself i cant stand the
thought of either one of you being hurt
you were going to do some talking
iris im listening

che was silent a moment when she
 spoke her voice was soft almost tone-
less with you steve everything has to
be either black or white right or wrong
yes or no cant you understand how it
might be different for some people how
it might be with me and the way  feel to-
ward you and con 

  go on steve said drily tall me how
hard it is for a woman to resist a hand-
some wealthy smooth-talking gent like
con pardee thats something i can really
understand iris

her shoulders seemed to slump beneath
the thin material of her dress she let her

                        i

breath out slowly

  its no use steve    i- suddenly
her hands came up to her face and she ws
crying her whole body shook

 almost instinctively steve stepped close
and took her in his arms hed been a fool
a damned crazy fool he was seeing the
woman he loved for the last time-and yet
hed made it a torture for both of them
why had he wanted her to suffer why
hadnt he been man enough to face the facts
the way he was man enough to face par-
dees guns why in hell hadnt he stayed
away from her

  he put the tips of his fingers beneath her
chin and tilted her face up to his he said
good-by iris  and kissed her

  her lips were moist and warm-and
there was the taste of her tears on them
her rounded young body was smooth and
firm in his arms he drew her to him
pressing the yielding curves hard against
him almost lifting her from the floor slow-
ly her arms came up and fastened around
his neck her lips moved beneath his own
hesitantly at first and then with a demand-


fifteen western tales

ing insistence that left him a little dizzy
blood surged through him pounded his
temples and for a long abandoned moment
steve was aware of nothing but the burning
lips against his own

  when he finally let her go her face was
flushed her green eyes seemed darker
somehow they were heavy-lidded veiled
with the dark tangle of her lashes he
watched the rapid rise and fall of her breast
as she tried to catch her breath

  he was filled with a sense of wonder
he had kissed her many times before but
never had she responded like this

  she brought one hand up to smooth the
blonde hair back from her forehead smiling
at him now with those strangely darkened
eyes her lips a little swollen looking

  please steve    dont go out there
dont fight with con please

  so that was it shed thrown herself into
the kiss because she wanted to soften him
up she was afraid for con pardee she
had wanted to get him off balance so she
could plead with him to back out

  his lips formed words but he couldnt
speak them the sudden white anger in
him choked him numbed his lips and
tongue he stood there feeling the cold
sweat crawl across his shoulders his big
hands balled into hard fists against his
thighs

  her eyes widened her lower lip quiv-
ered

  steve why are you looking at me that
way

  slowly very slowly he brought his
hands up to the butts of the s tied low
on either leg he tapped his fingers against
the cut-out holsters his eyes locked with
hers

  it didnt work iris he said tightly
therell be a fight his eyes darted
quickly to the clock on the wall and back
again in less than five minutes in front
of the inferno the tight knot of anger in
his chest made it hard to breath and
listen iri im eoine to kill con he may

get me too-but im going to take him with
me

  steve dont go

  what do you want me to do run

  yes run-do anything-but dont
fight with him

  he turned and walked to the door

  sorry iris he said running from a
fight is one thing i just never learned to
do

the swarming noisy street seemed even
more crowded than before as steve
stepped to the boardwalk and turned his
steps toward the inferno saloon he
walked with eyes straight ahead not speak-
ing to anyone vaguely aware of the curious
faces that peered at him from beneath the
wooden awnings catching now and then
the guarded mention of his name and
sometimes the names of con pardee and
iris manning

  he came abreast of the inferno the
street in front of it was deserted as he had
known it would be this was to be the
stage the arena he paused looking across
the wagon ruts at the garish front of the
inferno on either side of the ornate bat-
wings had been painted a red devil eight
feet tall in the wavering blood-red light
of pine-knot flares the devils seemed al-
most alive

  it was midnight

  a bright mass of brass-colored curls and
a white powdered face appeared over the
top of the batwings

  tell con hes got company outside
steve yelled at the girl and tell him his
companys already tired of waiting

  his hands went down his holsters once
more checking the position of them against
his legs he dried his palms on the sides
of his levis and forced himself to take long
deep breaths

  he was thinking of nothing but con
pardee now and of the one chance he had
to live beyond the next few seconds con
pardee was faster he knew he was the
gun-meeting at midnight



fastest man alive but he had had to sacri-
fice accuracy for the blazing speed at a
short distance there could he no beating
him but if he were forced to fight from a
distance the width of the street-forty feet
from boardwalk to boardwalk-then his
slight wildness might be just enough to
even the odds

  steve planted his feet wide apart on the
planking and waited

  the batwings burst open con pardees
tall wedge-shaped body stood silhouetted
against the curtain of light behind him he
was smiling a dark-haired dark-eyed man
handsome but with no touch of weakness in
his even-featured face

  con pardee stood between the batwings
a long moment smiling at steve he
seemed to be relaxed unhurried he turned
his head slightly to the left and said some-
thing over his shoulder to the room behind
him and someone guffawed loudly the
devils on either side of him writhed in the
flare light the single gun on his right leg
glinted dully it was the first time steve
had ever known him to wear but one gun

  pardee let the batwings swing shut be-
hind him and stepped out on the boardwalk

  now stve thought now his right
hand blurred toward his gun butt down
and up again in almost the same movement
and at the same instant he threw his lean
body to one side and felt the buck of the
gun against his palm over there across
the street another gun was thundering
something sledge-hammered into steves
shoulder and he felt himself jerked almost
completely around the boardwalk tilted
and swayed beneath his feet the flare
lights began to revolve lazily floating slow-
ly avvay from him growing dim and then
his face was in the dust of the street and he
was choking on it

  the sharp bite of the dust on his tongue
brought to him the realization of what had
happened he forced himself to his knees
reaching for the gun in his left holster his
right arm a helpless bleeding weight

against his side but the gun was no longer
in its leather his right gun had been
knocked fronwhis hand and now his left
gun must have fallen out of its holster
when a bullet knocked him to the ground

  he heard a man shout and somewhere
a woman screamed he jerked his head up
just in time to see pardee rushing him
and now he remembered what pardee had
promised the town he would do to him he
would wing him hed said-and then kill
him with his bare hands and hed winged
him all right even with that blazing
speed hed been accurate as a man could
be and now he was lunging forward to
keep the second part of his promise

  steve watched him coming sick in the
knowledge that his strategy had failed he
hadnt even scratched pardee and now
he had but one arm against the other mans
two-and he was losing blood from his
smashed shoulder he looked for his guns
he saw one of them half buried in the dust
but it was too far away to help him now

tte dug his toes into the dust and
slithered to one side a split instant be-
fore pardees heavy body crashed into his
own he was knocked flat on his back by
one of pardees flailing boots and before
he could move again the bigger man had
turned and was astride of him his fists
pounding against steves face like pistons
steve drew his legs up as high as he could
and slammed his feet down hard and
arched his back it threw pardee back over
his head

  but steve was free for only an instant
he scarcely had time to suck in his breath
before pardee was on him again fighting
with his feet this time kicking at steves
head savagely with his high-heeled boots
one of the heels caught steve on the side
of his neck-aftd for a moment he thought
the fight was over but pardee was too
anxious to finish him he rushed in too
fast too confidently as his boot went back

injun list

he had only his pride left
when that ivas gone the judge
knew it was time to die

they called him the judge he
lived in a little log cabin behind the
last chance saloon it might have
been big pete enright who started calling
him that because he worked for pete
swamping in the saloon pete owned the
last chance

  nobody seemed to remembered when the
judge had drifted into the little mining
camp of enright montana pete always
claimed that the judge had been around

injun list



town maybe a year before anybody ever
took notice of him pete liked to josh like
that pete just about owned the town
big redheaded bull-necked that was pete
he had discovered the last chance mine
and had taken a fortune out of it he liked
to run his own gambling house and saloon
sometimes he would deal other times he
would tend bar he did his own bouncing
and boasted that he could lick any man in
the little rockies yet he was good na-
tured and was always jobbing somebody

  it was pete enright who put the judge
 the injun list which hung above the
bottles and glasses on the back bar

  a wife a mother a father a son could
put a drunken relative on the injun list
providing they showed pete sufficient proof
of the charges against the drunkard and
why he should be so publicly listed pete
who was a law unto himself in enright
would pass judgment

  pete enright never realized how much
he had hurt the judge when he printed his
name at the head of the injun list pete
wasnt sensitive and therefore could not
understand how any man could be so deep-
ly hurt as he hurt the judge by his practical
joking only when it was too late did pete
realize what he had done

  you see the time had been when this
white-hair little old drunkard was a man
nobody knew who he was what he had
been or why he had become a saloon bum
cleaning brass cuspidors and sprinkling
sawdust on a barroom floor for that mat-
ter nobody much cared anything about the
judge one way or another mining camps
like enright are made up of hard-rock
miners and the sporting element who fol-
low the gold trails derelicts like the judge
are brushed aside ignored

  but somewhere some time the judge
had been a gentleman and scholar even
when he was drunk which was most of
the time he kept himself clean his thread-
bare suit was carefully brushed his shoes
polished his frayed linen washed and

      authors note-

       there is a lazv in the united states
       forbidding the sale of liquor to an
       indian in some montana cozvtowns
       lists of the names of men who for
       one reason or another were forbid-
       den to drink were posted in all the
       saloons these lists were called nat-
       urally enough injun lists

ironed he wore an old derby hat high
crowned many years out of date and his
talk his manner of speech was that of a
polished gentleman drunkard that he was
he clung with a pitiful desperation to that
slender thread of gentility    and in the
gray hours of dawn he would change to
overalls and an old flannel shirt and rusty
shoes and alone in the empty saloon
would clean the cuspidors and mop the
floor now and then helping himself to a
nip from the bottle

  in his own uncouth way big pete en-
right befriended the judge he had staked
him to grub and blankets and put a camp
stove in the cabin for him when stran-
gers came to town pete would always in-
clude the judge when they bought drinks
for the house and if the judge as was
his wont engaged someone in conversa-
tion holding them by the spell of his ora-
tory quoting shakespeare and the bible
and blackstone letting his listeners buy
more drinks pete enright would enjoy it
as he would have enjoyed a show after
his own rough fashion he liked the judge
in his own way he was kind to that bat-
tered bit of human driftwood he had found
and befriended

  the judge in his threadbare black
broadcloth suit his frayed white shirt his
black string tie basked in the warmth of
this false prosperity he drank his drinks
kept up his game of sham affluence with a
pitiful heroism his hours of agony came
when alone in the saloon lie swamped up
only whiskey could dull that terrible pain
of defeat and degradation to the judge it
was both his curse and his one surcease
from mental torture

  whatever were his hundredfold regrets
he kept them secreted in his heart in the
gray dawn the bar mirror reflected the
agony written on his face the light of de-
spair in his bloodshot eyes when he had
discarded his working clothes and later in
the day mingled with the men at the bar
he became mellow loquacious witty at
times and no man among them ever read
what torture what black despair was so
hidden by that gallantry

  how could pete enright roughneck
miner and saloonman have read any such
thing in the eyes of the judge that is

fifteen western tales

placed sense of humor it wouldnt be fair

they had hit a rich vein up at the last
chance mine pete enright celebrated
samples of the rich ore were on the back
bar other samples in his coat pockets
drinks at the last chance were free pete
enright was celebrating his mine was
going to make him a millionaire

  everbody belly up to the bar he
roared time after time

  nobody paid any attention to the judge
he was carelessly pushed and shoved aside
at the bar the mining camp of enright
was celebrating it bad no time for a dere-
lict swamper the judge drank alone
drink after drink his modulated bits of
conversation blotted out by blatant music
and loud voices when he had reached
his capacity he staggered out the back door
and to his cabin

  towards morning when the celebration
was at its height some whim suggested the
judge to the mind of pete enright he
wanted him to make a speech about the
new gold strike but the judge was in his
bunk asleep

  big pete enright reached up and took
the injun list from its place on the back
bar chuckling he printed boldly in black
letters at the head of the list the judge

  it was after the celebration was over
after pete enright had gone up to the mine
and the crowd had drifted to their cabins
that the judge unlocked the front door and
brought in bis mop and broom and bucket
the place was littered with cigarette and
cigar butts the gray light that filtered
through the big windows gave the place a
dismal appearance the stench of tobacco
smoke and stale beer hung heavy in the
air the judge shuddered with nausea he
needed a bracer he was pouring it with
unsteady hands when he happened to no-
tice the injun list propped against an
empty bottle on the bar

  the bottle and glass he had been hold-
ing slid from his grip smashing on the
floor he stood there bloodshot eyes star-
ing at the list disbelief something akin
to horror showed in his eyes his face
was as gray as the dawn that showed
against the windows

  he stood there a long time then he
picked up the injun list and put it back in
its accustomed place after that he went

slowly shakily about his work every
nerve every fiber of his wracked body
called for whiskey but he did not take a
drink when his work was finished he
went out the back way to his cabin just
as the morning bartender came on shift

  once in his little log cabin he sat down
weakly on the edge of his bunk he buried
his gray face in his hands sobs tore his
throat

  pete enright didnt know he had left
for butte to be gone indefinitely in the
days that followed nobody in enright
figured it was necessary to write him that
somebody had found the judge sick out
of his head locked in his cabin for a week
the judge hovered between life and death
then he regained his senses and his
strength when he was strong enough he
went back to work but he no longer made
his appearance in the saloon except when
he came with his mop and bucket

  perhaps a few of the crowd missed him
and his speeches but if they did they did
not take the trouble to find out why the
judge no longer lined up at the bar for his
free drinks in this rush for gold they were
too busy to care why an old bar-fly failed
to show up for the most part he wasnt
even missed

  but there behind the bar was the injun
list every morning when the saloon was
empty the judge would come in with his
mop and his bucket his gait was shuffling
old his hands were atremble with palsy
but his eyes looking up at the injun list
were no longer blurred by whiskey the
judge had not touched a drop since that
gray morning when he had found his name
on the list god and the judge alone knew
the never-ending struggle for booze that
tore at his vitals like a gnawing cancer
even as only god and the judge knew
why he no longer mingled with the crowd
that lined the bar

pete enright still in butte did not
know what he had done to the judge
he did not know what humiliation he had
inflicted on the whitehaired swamper it
had ridiculed the pitiful show of respecta-
bility that he had clung to it had shown
him up for what he was a barroom hanger-
on a drunkard impossible now to play
that brave game he had kept up with his
name posted there for all men to see the
injun list



last bit of life left him had been killed
that little glow of false happiness was now
a cold thing as cold as the bleak winter
mornings when he made a fire in the
saloon stove and fought back the terrible
craving for a bottle pete enright might
have murdered him and done a more merci-
ful thing

  sometimes the judge would stand there
in the chill dawn looking at his name on
the injun list he would stand there a
long time his mop in his hand a strange
look in his blue eyes which no longer held
the spark of a twinkle it was as if he were
reviewing his past delving back into
buried thoughts torturing himself with bit-
ter memories his gaze focused on the
injun list on the name that headed the
list the judge then he would go
back to work looking older his cheeks
more gray the luster gone from his eves

  there must have been times during those
dismal hours when the judge hated big
pete enright hated him as a man can
hate but few men but there were other
times when he was shut in his cabin
warm sheltered from the blizzards his
grub supply well stocked tobacco to smoke
when he remembered that pete enright
had given him all this even the set of
shakespeare the battered law library other
books that pete had picked up somewhere
and had donated to the cabin books that
had kept the judge from going mad at
times the gift of the one man in town who
had befriended him

  pete enright had found him drunk
asleep in a snowbank behind the saloon
one night pete had thawed him out
staked him to the cabin given him that
last chance to mingle with men once more
pete enright had befriended him the
judge felt that he owed him a debt of
honor even though pete had put him on
the injun list it was hard to hate a man
like pete enright because pete never
sought the enmity of any man the judge
knew that besides the judge had never
known how to hate that was perhaps
why he did what he did right there at the
end

  you see pete enright had gotten in
some time during the night it was snow-
ing hard and the town had gone to bed
early only a few men in town knew that
pete was back from butte he had come

back to buy up some mining claims be-
cause he always made cash deals he had
brought the money with him fifty thou-
sand dollars in currency he had it in his
pocket when he let himself into the last
chance just about dawn he wanted to
put the money in the safe the night bar-
tender had locked up the place was
empty pete turned on the light in the
office and squatted on his heels to open the
safe as he swung the door open a voice
behind him spoke evenly

  up with em enright plenty high
make a move that looks bad and well kill
you pete raised his hands slowly as he
got to his feet his back was still turned
to the man who had ordered him to stick
em up he had on a long coonskin coat
its frogs fastened no chance of getting
to his gun in its shoulder holster not an
easy job to put up a fight in a big fur coat
nevertheless pete took a chance he
didnt care about the money so much but
for pete enright the big mygul in the
camp to be stuck up that was what rubbed
he ducked and whirled a gun roared in
his face he fell the hot thud of a bullet
in his shoulder then he was fighting the
three men who piled onto him clubbing
at his head with guns

  the judge had seen the light in the
saloon as he came in the back way he
supposed the night bartender had forgot
to put out the lights when he went off
shift carrying his bucket and mop he
came in the back door then stood frozen in
his tracks

  up in front behind the frosted-glass
partition that marked the office a terrible
fight was going on the judge heard the
voice of pete enright snarling curses
other voices calling to each other drowned
it out then someone said

  kill im boys we got to now he
knows us git enright

  there was a gun behind the bar a
single-action  the judge set down his
bucket and mop and slipped along the bar
now he rounded the end of the bar and
his hand gripped the gun he didnt know
much about a gun he had never owned
so much as a  rifle but he knew enough
to thumb back the hammer and pull the
trigger aiming wildly at the three men who
had clubbed burly pete enright to his
knees

fifteen western tales

without thinking like a man
gripped in the icy clutch of a horrible
nightmare the judge kept shooting
vaguely he felt the heavy thud of bullets
hitting him there was blood a man
doubling up there on the floor twisting
pete enright on his feet his big hands
smashing down two blood-spattered men
kicking guns from their hands then the
judge didnt know anything more there
was a smear of red that turned to black-
ness

  when he awoke he was laid out on a
card table big pete enright was work-
ing over him with a basin of water and a
bar towel other men stood around

  bring him a drink one of you called
pete who was battered and bleeding
whiskey

  the judge shook his head pete en-
right followed the dying mans gaze to that
injun list then he knew all of a sud-
den he knew without being told he knew
the thing he had done to this little old
swamper who had saved his life

  pete enright walked behind the bar
and took down the injun list he went
back to the table where the judge lay with
his blood-smeared hands he marked off that
name the judge from the head of the
list

 the judge smiled and nodded the
look of despair was gone from his eyes
now in the lamplight the lines on his
face softened happiness was written
there then the weary lids closed

  the judge was off the injun list for

            continued from page 
again steves left hand snaked out and
caught pardees other ankle and jerked it
toward him pardee sprawled in the dirt

  before con could recover steve threw
both legs around his waist and locked his
feet together he closed his eyes and gritted
his teeth and brought every ounce of his
strength to bear on squeezing pardees
breath from his body he ground his knees
into the ribs of the threshing man between
his legs and then he bent forward sudden-
ly and caught his left arm around pardees
throat and jerked his head back

  pardee fought the only way he could
with vicious powerful jabs of his elbows
into steves stomach and ribs

  steve increased the pressure on pardees
throat pardee was choking he knew but
pardee was not going to die that way he
was going to die of a broken neck he
pulled the dark head back another inch lis-
tening to the big man gasp listening to the
soft sound of tortured muscles and bones

  and then over the shouts of the crowd
he heard a girl screaming and he knew it
was iris manning

  he opened his eves she was nearer than
hed thought in the street with them less
than ten feet away one tiny hand was
stretched toward them as if to stop them
and her face was twisted with hysteria she
screamed once more-and then she covered
her face with her hands and sank slowly to
her knees for a moment she rocked back
and forth sobbing and then she fell

  steve jordan stared at the small blonde
girl who lay there so near him-and slowly
the kill-fever drained from him and he was
very very sick he knew shame deep and
terribleshame he had never known ex-
isted and he knew hate-but hate for
himself and for what he had done because
his own heart was broken he had tried to
break iris mannings heart-break it by
killing the man she loved

  he looked at the blonde curls splayed out


  gun-meeting at midnight

in the dust of main street and he thought
it isnt too late i can give con back to her
-alive he would have killed me but i
cant kill him iris happiness depends on
his staying alive and thats all that mat-
ters i have to let con live because my love
for iris is stronger than my hate for him-
he relaxed his pressure on cons neck
enough for con to catch his breath

  he said con listen to me i know
theres one thing more sacred to you than
anything else your word give me your
word youll stop fighting if i let you go
moments passed  while con pardee
gulped air into his bursting lungs then
you win steve youve got it

  and one more thing con steve said
tightly i want your word that youll be
good to iris

  yes yes con rasped god steve
let go of me

  steve loosened his hold and got to his
feet he stood aside and watched pardee
come erect wary of any false move

  con turned to face him naked hatred in
his eyes hut there was something besides
the hatred and steve knew it for what it
was respect he watched as con walked
unsteadily toward the prostrate form of iris
manning the crowd had broken from the
boardwalks and was surging into the street
two older women lifted iris in their arms
her eyelashes fluttered and she looked
about her wildly

  it was enough to make any woman faint
steve thought but shell be all right shell
have con and everything will be all right
his whole body ached from the wound in
his shoulder he had to see doc greer
and then he had to get out of fever wells

nphe first yellow rays of sunlight were
a slanting through his window when
steve finally buckled the last strap around
his suitcase and set it near the door of his
room it had taken doc greer a long time
to dress his shoulder and packing with the

use of only one ijand had been a slow proc-
ess but thered been no real hurry the
first stage to puma flat didnt leave until
eight

  the knock on his door was timid hesi-
tant a womans knock he opened the
door and stood back and as he looked at
the fresh blonde beauty of iris manning he
wished somehow that he had died down
there in the dust of main street

  she smiled and closed the door behind
her quietly

   whats this he said bitterly

  she slid into the narrow space between
him and the window her warm body touch-
ing his her rounded arms about his slim
hard waist

   youve packed your suitcase she said
where are we going steve

   he looked at her at the beautiful face so
close to his at the full red lips

  we he said

   if  if you want me steve

  but-

   con left fever wells forever last night
steve she said but before he did he
told me what youd done you let him live
because you thought i loved him

  and i was right steve said

  no darling you were wrong i tried
to tell you that last night but you wouldnt
listen you couldnt understand that a
woman could love you and still have a little
room in her heart for another man
only women and sky pilots talk like
that he said what kind of a fool do you
take me for

 no fool steve no fool at all but a
man a hard man too hard to understand
how i felt about con he was kind and
gentle to me steve always and he loved
me i couldnt forget that i didnt want
you to kill him

   he looked at her searchingly is that
why you kissed me the way you did
the color rose in her throat and into her
cheeks


gun-meeting at midnight

  why then she was even lovelier
when she blushed he decided

  her voice was very low because i
knew you were my man

  somehow he knew-without quite know-
ing how he knew-that she was telling him
the truth and it came to him that con
pardee must have realized the same thing
he thought of his fight with con-but
there was no anger now no hatred con
was a man like himself he had loved and
fought and lost-and stepped aside and
he had paid tribute-to steve by telling iris
what steve had done you couldnt hate a
man with guts like that not any more

  she moved closer to him her lips
against bis cheek were soft

  there was still one more thing to be said
-one question remaining in his mind

  you kept me waiting two years iris
why

  he felt her arms tighten around him and
with his one good arm he drew her to him

  because you were a lawman steve
you rode the town every night and sooner
or later somebody    her voice trailed
off and then suddenly her young body
straightened and her clear eyes met his
but im not afraid any longer stevd im
proud of you ill be the proudest wife in
fever wells

  maybe steve said softly but you

fifteen western tales

             continued from page 
 selves to pieces and then find our caravan
 is split by a tilted ocean of mud theres
 nothing left on this slope but loose dirt
 itll wash and wash you with it look down
 the slope look down i dare you do you
 want to wash down that hill into the valley
 the wind was stronger now and all felt it
 pushing them and felt themselves teetering
 as people will in high places but still joel
 kalder stood on his perch far above them
 with the wind whipping at him

   a drop of water spattered on bill shawns
 forehead

   something began to flame inside him
 there was one thing kalder couldnt do
 and that was ask the heavens for water
 that much shawn knew he could not ex-
 plain it to them he hadnt the words but
 now he wasnt inclined to talk he began to
 climb he pulled himself up the taut rope
 clawing his boots at the slope he climbed
 steadily without speaking looking directly
 up at the man on the rock he thought only
 that they were going to oregon and going
 there now and no slick-mouthed shyster
 would stand in the way

   kalder cried you cant touch me-
 but his voice quavered as he cried out he
 saw shawn advancing relentlessly big hands
 hauling steadily at the rope lifting himself
 as steadily and forcefully up the slope as
 another man might descend now kalder
 cried ill stop you shawn ill stop you
 from leading us to ruin

 ralders long hand plunged into his
 pocket he pulled out a revolver a
 heavy short-barreled weapon he waved it
 around his head and then leveled it on
 bill shawns face and cocked it ill stop
 you stop you 

   better call for some rain to stop me
 shawn growled and climbed on it was only
 twenty feet now and he saw the mans boots
 bracing on the rock as wind threatened to
 topple him he saw kalders coat whip and
 then like a sudden blossoming a red flash
 at the mans fist for a second it hid his
 fist and the gun with one screaming swipe
 shawns hat was flung off and the bullet
 rapped and tore at his head he shook his
 head and dragged himself on

   bill saw that kalder had been thrown off
 balance by the kick of the gun and reckoned
over the hill to hell

he wasnt used to it gleefully shawn re-
flected that a lawyers best weapon was his
tongue and kalder was realizing that too
late like a great ape swarming up that
rope shawn flung all his strength into a last
spurt up to the rock and hurled himself at
the legs of the man standing on it he heard
the deafening blast of the gun but grasping
one of kalders boots in his fist he wrenched
at it the lawyers weight left him and h
went flopping through the air to tumble and
crash down below shawn looked down and
saw kalders coattails flapping as the man
hurtled down towards the group of men on
the rope then kalder stopped falling and
lay gulping for air at their feet

  shawn panting nodded grimly then
brushed his hands on his levis and bellowed
git onto that rope were headed oregon
way and he felt it in his voice again the
sureness the certainty that they would make
it up this ledge

  he clambered down the rope to the others
and they heaved they glanced once at the
bloodied lawyer sitting against a rock hold-
ing his head in his hands and heaved
slowly the wagon began to inch its way up
the slope they heaved laughing cheering
wasting breath on yells the wagon inched
up to that open almost-flat place by the
rock it rammed the rock with a quiver that
shook its whole framework and the polers
jammed wagon tongues through from wheel
to wheel until at last there was a wagon
perched on top of the mountain   

  those days when they tooled fast across
the plateau fearing snow shawn was often
with hannah riding beside her on the seat
of her conestoga

  she said one day you ruined a promis-
ing career in politics shawn

  he grinned ive seen likelier-looking
politicians greasin wheel hubs every night
the last two months heres two of the
best-a little young yet though he jerked
a thumb at hannahs two boys either one
of you younkers aim to be president of
oregon one day

  naw the younger one replied were
gonna be bullwhackers 

  shawn laughed and looked ahead through
the heavy green of the spruce forest off into
the blue distance where the land began to
fall toward oregon

fifteen western tales

             continued from page 
 north so im pretty well familiar with the
 vulture gold mines history as well as its
 geology

   however i havent a record of the big
 horn mts geology but believe it to be similar
 to that of the harquahala mts close to it for
 that matter the big horn rock formations are
 probably about like thoje of the vulture
 range which has gold veins and gold placers
 tht have been mined for a great many years
 tho new veins might yet be found

   this range is some  feet altitude above
 sea level and rises about  feet above the
 surrounding desert in general the rocks are
 gray granit in dikes and irregular masses that
 were thrust-up intruded into areas of pre-
 cambrian schistose sediments with later ter-
 tiary rhyolitic laval flows very promising
 formations for the contact type of ore veins
 chiefly with quartz-gold there are in fact a
 great many auriferous quartz veins seams
 and veinlets scattered widely over this range
 with the vulture mine on what is the largest
 vein yet found at any rate the weathering
 of all of these gold veins through centuries has
 resulted in gold placer concentrations from all
 the drainage area around the vulture mine

   they were first found in  and worked
 by dry washers with several hundred men
 working the washes and arroyos each per-
 mitted only  sq ft of ground many getting
  tf a day in coarse angular gold and
 nuggets but by  the richest was about
 all worked out though many came to work in
 late winter and early in spring using wet-
 washing methods from the heavy rains getting
 most of the gold from bedrock gravels that
 are always the richest all ground has been
 worked but govt report in - was 
 worth recovered from this entire area

   gold placers also have been worked around
 morristown about  miles southeast of wick-
 enburg on us-- on branch creeks of the
 hassayampa river flowing in from the south
 end of wickenburg mts in san domingo
 wash old woman gulch rogers and sanger
 washes etc

   now these mountains are known mostly for
 gold deposits and there hasnt been very much
 hunting for semi-precious stones in either re-
 gion youve asked about i have the gem-
 stones of all arizona listed but with rather
 little in maricopa county however if you
 locate any pegmatite dikes youll then have a
 good chance of a discovery of many types
 topaz beryl etc in any case youll find good
 agate cutting-material in the hills near mor-
 ristown with also some white opal and tire
 opal at times reported from there chalcedony
 carnelian north of wintersburg garnets in
 schists all over
hell on wheels

continued from page 

  jed was such an unsightly corpse that his
former admirers decided to inter him in the
boneyard that very night in a torchlight
funeral

  rig tim malloys saloon was half-empty
after the funeral party went on its sad and
dutiful way those left in the saloon had
refused out of respect to their own dead
foreman to join in the midnight burial
they would have their inning in the bone-
yard come sunday-and not before

of a sudden slim loper demonstrated
that he did not always think like a mule a
slow grin spread over his gaunt face as he
drawled men looks like we collect the
bets we made the minute they sink jed
mink in the boneyard out there we win
the money jed made the boneyard first
amid howls of glee and cheers of vic-
tory the welch mourners descended on big
tim malloy stakeholder par excellence
pay us off tim shouted somebody
wheel yelled another pressing up to
tim   

  it was some time before big tims pro-
tests could be heard with perspiring brow
and shaking hands he wailed but-but-
you boys know i already paid off to the
mink crowd i paid off when welch got
dead i thought-

  thought hell hollered a spokesman
for the menacing crowd our bets were
plain we bet that mink would be in the
boneyard permanent before welch would
thats all they is to it pay off

fifteen western tales

  big tim stalled for time to think also
he felt he wouldnt be so all alone in his
new misery when the mink crowd returned
from the torchlight funeral i dont pay
off until the other boys come back and tell
me that jed is definitely buried in the bone-
yard

  having learned the lesson about many
a slip  the welch crowd agreed to wait
until proof positive came in that mink had
been duly interred they had not long to
wait

  when the burial party came whooping
into the warmth of the- saloon they were
greeted by big tims anxious but foolish
question did you bury mink in the bone-
yard 

  they had tenderly and with grim final-
ity jed mink had beyond all shadow of
a doubt made the boneyard before pike
welch

  in that case shouted big tim mal-
loy all you crooks what i paid off too
soon by mistake will kindly give me back
the money i gotta give it to the rightful
winners the ones who bet on mink

  to the gathered railroaders this was an
hilarious remark they howled the worried
malloy down although they had been split
into two separate groups there were no
personal bad feelings neither mink nor
welch had been especially popular-both
being foremen-and the two factions were
merely split when it came to the betting
now they had suddenly joined together in
a common cause railroad builders versus
big tim malloy

  it took only a few minutes of rugged per-
suasion to convince big tim that he would
have to pay off-again tears were rolling
down his fat hog-like cheeks as he doled
out for the second time money to the win-
ners the new winners

  big tim had nothing left now but his
portable saloon and his stock of cheap whis-
key later that night one of the whiskey
barrels exploded the resultant fire com-
pletely destroyed the saloon and its con-
tents

  big tim suddenly found out that he
would have to demean himself and go to
work if he wanted to continue eating with
regularity within a week he was reluc-
tantly at hard labor-as a union pacific
track layer	o o o
the bushwhack bargain



          continued from page 
head first into the clearing he got three
cartridges into place and jerked the cylinder
shut cole tolman was on his knees then
his gun still in his hand jesses shot was
low and he saw coles legs slam out from
under him his second shot hit him in the
chest and he spun on his side and then fell
over on his face he moved once and was
still

  harder watched him for a minute reload-
ing the colt and listening to the quiet of the
clearing in the brush near the river he
could hear one of the horses moving aimless-
ly-

  he felt at the wound on his shoulder
but it was just a burn he slipped the colt

back into the holster spoke to the sorrel
and moved slowly up the canyon toward the
foothills

  once in the foothills he found an old cow
trail and rode listlessly along it the fight
gone out of his body when he reached the
ridge of the low hills he stopped and looked
back into the valley down below he could
see the few lights of the little town and fur-
ther down the valley near the dark outline
of the river he could see the lights of the
barn and a few people moving around it he
watched them for a moment his mjnd quiet
and lonely one more town left behind he
thought as he turned the horse back onto the
trail but out ahead of him somewhere in
the darkness was another one ooo
