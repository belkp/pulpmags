near dutchmans hill here was nothing lovely about dutchmans hill in that country of bleak barren uplifts this particular emi- nence had not even the dis- tinguishing factor of height it was squatty and covered with dun-colored rocks and sprawling cactus clumps ugly positively forbidding to the view from any angle dutchmans hill was a minus quantity so far as scenery was concerned yet jack wilkinson artist of los angeles was industriously transferring that hill to canvas-bring- ing to bear on the work all his cunniner ibtn craftsmanship all his masterful knowl- edge of the law of natural chiaroscuro in which masses of light and dark are played against each other in delicate contrasts that seem neither harsh nor artificial  had wilkinson been doing in oils a bit of his loved california sierras he could not have labored more faithfully as a matter of fact-and wilkinson would have admitted it cheerfully-he was out for the long green a pluto- crat had offered him real money in four figures to paint pictures of a scorched and blighted wilderness art for arts sake is all very well but many an artist is now pocketing his finer sensibilities on account of this h c of l if a b hero william- wallace coofe  top notch magazine plutocrat wanted a picture of dutch- mans hill of the box canon and caves of the cattywainpus of the lone cotton- wood on hardly able flat and of the historical spot in which the said pluto- crat had sold out his holdings in ojo caliente valley why it was up to wil- kinson to execute the commission and pull down the coin when a mans pocketbook crowds his heart out of a job the job is a real one wilkinson found it so neverthe- less under his big green sketching um- brella he sweated and mixed his colors and laid on the paint with a diligence and skill that threatened to make of that blistered desert barnacle a thing of beauty so true was wilkinsons touch and so fine his fancy that he could not put brush to canvas without leaving indelible marks of his own high nature in the work of his hand even when his inspiration was nothing more than a plutocrats cash he could have wrenched a better effect out of dutchmans hill had he done his sketching at sunrise or sunset but this was not in his contract the plutocrat insisted that he paint the hill in mid-afternoon also that he put a buckskin mule by a heap of rocks marked x on a penciled diagram and a man in a blue flannel shirt and an attitude of extreme dejection on top of the rocks-a man with the facial resemblance of the plutocrat at the age of twenty-five to put a complete hill on a canvas two feet one way by two and a half the other and then drop in a buckskin mule and a man recog- nizable as the plutocrat in his younger years callcd for ingenuity wilkinson was exercising his inge- nuity when a firearm without the least warning whatever exploded behind him the green umbrella went one way the easel went another and wil- kinson shot into the air and landed on all fours scattering paintbrushes he looked around cautiously oh im sorry i exclaimed a soft voice did  frighten you very much  a very pretty young woman was just sliding out of a mans saddle on the back of a pinto cayuse she had a revolver in her hand and plainly enough had done the shooting push- ing the revolver into a small holster strapped to her waist by a carved leather belt the girl ran to the over- turned easel and solicitously picked up the picture fortunately the canvas had fallen paint side up wilkinson arose to his feet fright- ened  he echoed certainly not whenever a twenty-centimeter shell ex- plodes under my chair it is my custom to go through a few simple exercises i hope i didnt annoy you he pulled a brushful of vandyke brown out of his hair and wiped a smear of gamboge off his chin the girl holding the picture in her hand looked laughingly across it at wilkin- son youre very good-natured about it anyhow she observed her eyes dropped to the canvas why she exclaimed this is a picture of dutch- mans hill r youve guessed it said wilkinson and youre an artist another guess i hope its correct he set up the easel and replaced the green umbrella in its proper position now then he inquired were you shooting at me or at the picture please be perfectly frank i know i ought to be shot for painting dutchmans hill but i was hoping i wouldnt be caught at it the girl placed the canvas carefully on the easel stepped back and indicated an object in the sand which had es- caped wilkinsons attention until that moment a rattlesnake neatly decapi- tated by the girls bullet lay within striking distance of the artists camp stool the diamond-back was coiled and rogue or hero  ready to strike the girl explained i saw it as i rode up you were so in- terested in your work that you didnt hear me or hear the rattler when it buzzed its warning i had to be quick wilkinson stared at the diamond- back then he advanced and bent over it six rattles and a button he re- marked straightening and i had to smash the last bottle of snake medicine yesterday to keep sam hooray from wandering among the rocks and coax- ing the snakes to bite him young lady what would have happened if you had failed to put that snake out of busi- ness wilkinson seemed io puzzle the girl she smiled at him and shook her head you give it up continued wilkin- son then listen and i will tell you he cleared his throat impressively i am here to perpetrate a series of six pictures by way of giving a panoramic view of the scenes of a plutocrats early beginnings if that snake had bitten the-er-artist-thank you-under the green umbrella this view of dutch- mans hill and of certain vistas up and down the cattywampus would never have been perpetuated in oils on be- half of napoleon g pendexter of los angeles and hollywood i thank you he bowed napoleon g pendexter there was awed surprise in the girls voice as she echoed the name you have heard of mr pendexter of course everybody has heard of him in this sun-scorched wilderness of rocks and sand touched with charm for the moment by the presence of a lovely young lady who knows how to shoot napoleon g pendexter once had what they call his habitat in other words that great man really lived and did strenuous things in these parts is that what surprises you why mr pendexter once was a half owner of the dolly varden claim which now belongs to my mother and he hired you to come out here and paint dutchmans hill she laughed i should think he would want to for- get this country and not have you paint pictures that will make him remember it thats my idea miss manning but when a plutocrat is self-made hes apt to be proud of his record i suppose somr wilkinson each surprised the other in the knowledge of names wilkinson ex- plained that he was the seventh son of a seventh son and had merely grabbed the girls name out of the air to prove his occultpowers still fur- ther he repeated her full name cherry manning then he wanted to know how his own name had dawned on her she answered ihat she had grabbed it off the lid of the battered tin box of paints rumor tells us miss manning re- marked that napoleon g pendexter is a hard-hearted disagreeable per- son one touch of rumor makes the whole world chin said wilkinson dont believe all you hear about na- poleon g i can tell you that- ah he broke off heres sam hooray and he comes in a hurry now whats to pay from the mouth of a little arroyo let into a ridge that faced dutchmans hill at a distance of several hundred yards a short brown man was sprint- ing he wore a high-crowned mexican hat a cotton shirt corduroy trousers and canvas shoes close to wilkinson he halted evidently abashed at the sight of miss manning banzai exclaimed wilkinson if i had pulled off a hundred-vard dasii like that this sizzling afternoon the sun would have bowled me over but sam here seems to be lined inside and out with asbestos miss manning this is my friend and factotum he looks after our camp while im out spoiling 	top-notci magazine some perfectly good canvas the big- gest difficulty about him is his name i cant pronounce it he comes of the old samurai however and so i have rechristened him sam hooray what appears to be the trouble sain please the japanese answered man fall from cliff he go to sleep  could not remain still for being troubled a man fell from the cliff re- turned wilkinson startled what cliff rattlesnake cliff honorable friend you come to relief of unfortunate per- son perhaps wilkinson whistled any man that takes a clean fall from the top of rat- tlesnake cliff he remarked has mighty little use for a relief party better bring a spade sam there is heartbeat and pulse move- ment said sam and i aspire to hope the girl climbed into the saddle on the pintos back where did this happen she inquired sam pointed toward a ridge that flanked the furrowed valley across from dutchmans hill the ridge el- bowed from north and south and trended away toward the southeast the angling face of it lay sheer to forming what was known as rattle- snake cliff around turn please said sam re- spectfully ill go with you mr wilkinson remarked the girl wilkinson told the jap to carry the picture and sketching outfit to the camp and then to join him and the girl on the scene of the accident ten minutes later the girl and the artist came to the bpot where the stranger had tumbled from the cliff and in the expressive words of sam had gone to sleep he was a man of twenty-four or twenty-five well built and wore brown corduroys and the laced knee boots of a prospector he lay in a huddle on his back and with his face upturned the girl slid from her saddle gave vent to an exclamation of alarm and sym- pathy and posted herself at wilkinsons side while he knelt and made an exam- ination sam was right about the heartbeat and pulse movement said he the heart action is strong enough for a man in robust health and it seems queer that this fellow should have stepped out the girl turned back to the pinto lifted a canteen from her saddle un- capped it and knelt on the opposite side of the sprawled-out form raise his head said she wilkinson did so and the mouth of the canteen was pressed to the mans lips the water trickled down his throat but consciousness did not re- turn there was not a mark or bruise about the man so far as wilkinson could see as the artist bent low over him the ticking of a watch was heard wilkinson removed the watch from the trousers watch pocket it was an ex- pensive timepiece with a gold case and having a cheap braided-leather chain on the front cover was a monogram consisting of the three letters h a p wilkinson returned the watch to the pocket started to his feet and walked thoughtfully back and forth at the foot of the cliff at that point the cliff was fifty feet high how could a man fall from it without suffering mark or bruise-or stopping his watch  something queer about this thought wilkinson chapter ii planned with care hen sam came wilkinson sug- gested carrying the injured man to their camp miss manning objected to this however and insisted on hav- ing him removed to her mothers adobe on the mining claim there were none rogue or hero  too many comforts at the adobe the girl explained but it was far and away better than a tent in an arroyo so the man in corduroys was lifted by the artist and the jap borne around a spur of the ridge and carried into the mud- walled house of the mannings t mrs manning was a woman of fifty wilkinson had been camped in the arroyo for only two days and was see- ing her now for the first time sam had told him about the mother and daughter who lived at the dolly yar- den picked up the rich float with their own hands and wrung the gold out of it by means of a wonderful little arrastre presumably sam had acquired his information in buenas noches but he was obliged to come from the arroyo to the dolly yarden claim for water and must have seen the two women at work mrs manning her sympathetic heart- touched by the misiortune of the stranger opened her house to him home remedies were tried in the hope of restoring him to consciousness but they did not prove effective it was a very puzzling case i cant understand this at all re- marked mrs manning a fall from the cliff might result in serious internal injuries i think we ought to have doctor wells come out from town we dont know that he fell from the cliff mrs manning said wilkin- son that is only a guess that makes the matter all the more puzzling and perhaps all the more seri- ous we should have the doctor if rou really think a doctor is nec- essary i can save you a lot of bother by taking the man to buenas noches in the automobile sam and i have in the arroyo wilkinson made the suggestion on impulse this affair of the unconscious stranger had an involved look to him and transferring the man to town offered an easy way for getting him off the mannings hands but the owner of the claim would not have it so heaven forbid she said that i should turn out of my home a man in the sorry condition of this stranger cherry will go to buenas noches for doctor wells no returned wilkinson well send sam in the flivver ill go over to camp with him and get him started if anything happens that you need me here fire that gun twice he nodded toward a rifle that hung from a big pair of antlers over a fireplace at a corner of the room ill hear the reports wilkinson added and ill come a-running mrs manning looked at her daugh- ter in bewilderment the girl laughed weve not going to stage any wiid- west show at the dolly yarden mr wilkinson she said why in the world should mother and i need you or any one except the doctor to help us take care of this ailing stranger its kind of you to send your man to town for doctor wells i hope she added that you will drop in on us occasionally to learn how the patient is getting along wilkinson answered that he would do that certainly then with a troubled glance at the form on the living-room couch he marched away with sam presently the two turned in at the mouth of the arroyo in front of them no more than a hundred yards away a small but comfortable wall tent had been pitched an extra fly stretched in front to form a sort of shaded porch two canvas chairs stood in the shade and on a bowlder off to one side a fold- ing gasoline stove had been opened out the usual plunder that accompanies an artist on a sketching expedition was scattered around mixed with the neces- sary paraphernalia of comfortable camping to the right of the tent stood the four-cylinder car in every way dependable although dingy and  top-notch magazine battered and showing other signs of hard usage there was one object in the camp however which wilkinson was seeing for the first time that object was a sorrel horse with one stocking foot under saddle and hitched to an ironwood tree looks like we had a visitor sam remarked wilkinson please said sam it is not a vis- itor mr wilk horse was discovered by me in chaparral of greasewood all my opinion is that animal belongs to person who fell from cliff i take lib- erty to bring horse to camp mr wilk and care for him so much as possible otherwise with his master incapaci- tated from giving care who is to do so ah i see exclaimed wilkinson give to gin satna a drink out of the five-gallon water bag then start for town and take the two-gallon bag with you get the doctor sam im anx- ious to have his opinion of the man we just left in the manning adobe it was sam who had dignified the flivver with the name of honorable foreigner wilkinson had been in the habit of referring to it affection- ately as the pop bottle but he had shoved that title aside to accept with a chuckle the togin sama of the jap in ten minutes sam was humming down the arroyo and out into the desert trail bound for buenas noches as soon as he had gone wilkinson went to the sorrel horse and loosened the sad- dle cinches the animal was thirsty and wilkinson drew water from the five-gallon bag into a canvas bucket and let him drink there was nothing about the riding equipment that would in any way iden- tify the horses owner sams infer- ence that the mount belonged to the man who had been carried to the adobe was a fair one while wilkinson stood surveying the animal two horsemen en- tered the arroyo and galloped to the camp one of the riders was reeves a dep- uty sheriff wilkinson knew him and had brought a letter of introduction to reeves from a mutual friend in los angeles the other man was a stranger both newcomers had their eyes on the sorrel horse that the cayuse newt inquired reeves newt who was evidently a cowboy nodded vigorously thats my pete hawse all right reeves he declared the jap steered us plumb right when he sent us here the deputy sheriff turned to the artist howdy wilkinson  said he we met your jap hiking for town in the buzz wagon and he gave us a tip that the sorrel was here shake hands with newt griffin wilkinson newts with the circle x crowd the horse belongs to him and was run off last night while newt was in town wvve put in the day trying to find the brute i can prove an alibi said wilkin- son laughing and so can sam neither of us was in buenas noches last night we cant be jugged for making off with this pete horse reeves grinned no ones trying to pin that to you old man you and your jap have a clean bill whered you find the sorrel in the chaparral sam did the finding and its been less than half an hour since he sprung the sorrel on me thats about what the jap told us reeves commented did he tell you anvtliing else no blame queer who fetched the cayuse out here muttered griffin we cant get any line at all on the feller that done it any stranger been visiting your camp lately wilkinson reeves asked wilkinson shook his head youre rogue or hero  the first visitors we have had since sam and i shook out our luggage and pitched the tent light wont you i dont think wed better the dep- uty answered its getting toward sundown and now that weve found what were after well be hitting the back track while griflin was unhitching the sor- rel and linking the animal to his saddle horn with a reata reeves chattered with the artist when ready to leave the deputy and his companion took long drafts from their water canteens and lighted their pipes im in luck and no mistake ob- served griffin with every show of sat- isfaction you see i allowed some greaser had run off the sorrel and scat- tered into mexico if any cimiroon comes lookin for the cayuse you hold him will you wilkinson newt that wont happen put in reeves if the thief returns for the horse i dont reckon hell inquire around any if he finds the animal gone so long wilkinson good luck griffin nodded and both men rode off with the pete horse in tow when they had vanished from the mouth of the arroyo wilkinson drew a long breath of relief but there was a wor- ried look on his face as he made his way to one of the canvas chairs in front of the tent and lowered himself into it sam didnt breathe a whisper about that fellow at mrs mannings he mused and neither did i looks like he was a horse thief among other things if im on the right track then chance has gone out of its way to put me wise to something of interest to napoleon g pendexter what im do- ing isnt in my contract with napoleon g but ive a hunch that hell appre- ciate my efforts all right if i- wilkinson broke off his reflections abruptly and was fairly lifted out of the chair by two reports of a firearm following each other in quick succes- sion the reports were from a dis- tance faint but clear and distinct i guess the wild-west show has started after all was wilkinsons startled thought he darted into the tent and emerged with a six-shooter then started at a run for the mouth of the arroyo half- way to the trail that passed the arroyo he drew to an astounded halt the man in laced knee boots and corduroys had appeared suddenly from the direction of the dolly yarden claim sprinting in a way that suggested robust health and remarkable staying qualities he flashed a dark figure against the yellow of the flat desert across the arroyos mouth and into a chaparral of grease- wood and white thorn losing himself in the dusty brush wilkinson gave vent  an amazed whistle the next instant a grim look came to his face and he gripped the six-shooter and raced on when the stranger emerged from the chaparral baffled and swearing wilkinson met him face to face wheres that horse yelled the stranger your recovery has been rapid wil- kinson remarked dont you know that we have sent to buenas noches for a doctor for you the other spat out an imprecation what have you done with that horse he went on the horse happened to belong to newt griffin of the circle x ranch griffin came after his property and brought the deputy sheriff along with him if youre claiming a sorrel with a stocking foot youll have to go to town and apply to the deputy but i dont think youll do that you- a thud of hoofs in the sandy trail reached wilkinsons ears out of the tail of his eye he saw a man on a buck- skin cayuse leaving the trail and career- top-notch magazine s ing into the arroyo hold that man shouted this newcomer hold him the man in corduroys stooped sud- denly and pulled a revolver out of the brush as he straightened with it in his hand wilkinson jumped for him and there followed a struggle in which the artist more than held his own wrenching the gun away from the horse thief the artist leaped back and covered the fugitive with his own weapon steady ordered wilkinson try to run and there will be fire- works the man on the buckskin cayuse rode up and dropped out of the saddle chapter iii not in tiie contract the man who had just arrived on the buckskin horse had a clear gray eye and a determined look he was in his middle twenties if wilkinson could judge and he was a lean brown tine-appearing person it was plain that he had important business with the horse thief ive been meeting people all after- noon remarked wilkinson and its a big surprise to me to find so much going on in this part of the desert whats the idea he asked the idea is answered the man by the buckskin that this fellow is a sneak and a scoundrel he pretended to be hurt and was taken to mrs man- nings adobe but you know all about that what you dont know is that he wasnt hurt but that he was shamming by malingering he succeeded in his pur- pose of getting inside the house on the dolly varden claim i rode up while miss manning and her mother were telling me about the fellow out in front of the adobe he was sneaking around inside the house-hunting for some- thing which he found and got away with he had to get away before the doctor came you see for if he hadnt he would have been found out he left by the rear door with what he wanted and what he had schemed to get when i stepped into the adobe to look at him he was gone mrs man- nings suspicions were aroused and something else was found to be gone too cherry-miss manning-fired the rifle twice from the door she hoped that would arouse you and that youd do something to head the fellow off as luck would have it you were able to do that very thing my name is alonzo condon the man added im a friend of miss manning and her mother and have known them for a long time wilkinson had been wondering who alonzo condon might be he had not been fully informed on that point but it was enough to know that condon was a friend of the two ladies at the dolly varden claim he has passed the buck to you re- marked wilkinson turning to the horse thief you are bad medicine thats sure and i doubt whether you can ex- plain this deal in a way that will let you out gracefully still youd better try remember he added warningly what i said about fireworks i dont think you want to be the central figure in the celebration first off who are you  jim higgins said the man in cor- duroys scowling try again requested wilkinson jim higgins doesnt match the mono- gram on your watch im jim higgins of yuma insisted the man angrily whats more i didnt steal the sorrel with the stocking foot nor anything out of the adobe what do you guys take me for he added in a blaze of well-assumed indig- nation i take you for a bad egg jim hig- gins wilkinson answered and if you have anything belonging to mrs man- ning now is the time to give it up v rogue or hero  higgins insisted that he was inno- cent of any thieving and wilkinson told condon to search him the search that followed was very thorough and there was a disappointed look on con- dons face as he stepped back theres something queer about this he remarked this man didnt fall from the cliff and im satisfied in my own mind that he was not unconscious what was his game if it were not to get inside mrs mannings adobe and take what has been found to be miss- ing as i figure it higgins planned on being found at the foot of the cliff by mrs manning and her daughter and taken to the house there was an ob- ject back of the scheme wait a minute said wilkinson this is his gun condon  he went on handing the weapon to condon you keep him covered while i do a little searching on my own hook wilkinson went to the greasewood bushes and at the point where higgins had stooped to recover his revolver reached into the dusty foliage groped about for a moment and finally with- drew a folded legal-looking document an exclamation of satisfaction escaped condon higgins swore under his breath this observed wilkinson calmly is a quitclaim deed to the dolly var- den claim executed in favor of mary manning by one joseph skeel is it what you are looking for condon thats it declared condon hig- gins ought to be jailed for stealing the deed there is something else he might be jailed for too wilkinson turned to higgins one week from to-day he went on ill have my camp pitched in the box canon of the catty wampus  ou report to me there jim higgins of yuma in just seven days from to- day dont forget between now and the time we meet again you try and behave why should i report to you an- swered higgins what business is it of yours where i go or what i do j ill do as i please its going to please you a heap to keep this date in the box canon as- serted wilkinson if youre not there according to schedule my laddybuck the deputy sheriff of this county will go hunting you for running off that sorrel horse now clear out give him the gun he added to condon condon broke the firearm emptied the cartridges out of the cylinder and then tossed the weapon to higgins the latter seemed to be in a quandary of some sort evidently he could not un- derstand the course of events turn- ing on his heel he slouched away to- ward the trail and vanished from sight in the direction of euenas noches that fellow is no good remarked condon why do you want to see him again wilkinson why are you interested in him  because of another person with whom i have a contract to paint a few landscapes in this blighted wilderness wilkinson answered come on to the tent condon and lets smoke a talk ill not keep you long condon hesitated a moment then led the buckskin into a scrap of shade and followed wilkinson to the camp the artist had cigars he offered one to condon and the two sat in the canvas chairs and smoked id better tell you about this deed remarked condon you havent ex- pressed any curiosity but what you have done this afternoon gives you a right to know what is going on sitting in the hot little arroyo with the sun dropping slowly behind dutch- mans hill condon related to wilkin- son a story of injustice and trickery which involved the dolly varden claim and mrs manning pendexters name was brought into the recital and wil- kinson listened with intense interest  top-notch magazine the recital began with an incident  which lay thirty years in the past nap pendexter was at that time struggling against poverty and dream- ing dreams of financial conquest among those arid mountains and mesas he had a pard known as pecos pete me gaffney-a one-eyed desert rat for whom pendexter had cherished a whole-hearted affection pendexter and mcgaffney had discovered the dolly yarden claim and in the upward fling of their fortunes had disposed of the claim to one joe skeel a prospector for six hundred dollars in cash skeel had had a friend named tobias man- ning manning had helped the pros- pector over many a rough spot in life and when manning died skeel passed his gratitude on to mannings wife and daughter skeel was stricken with ill- ness and mrs manning and cherry took care of him skeel died but be- fore his passing he tried to settle his debt to mrs manning by giving her a quitclaim deed to the dolly varden property mrs manning was in needy circumstances and she had moved out to the claim at once with her daughter and taken possession by gathering float and chipping out ore from an exposed vein the two women with skeels clever little water- power arrastre managed to secure enough gold to keep them in comfort all was going well when bill ranley a mining shark of buenas noches sud- denly presented himself before mrs maiming and claimed possession of the claim through a quitclaim deed given to him by skeel before the execution of skeels deed to the widow of his old friend ranley was a schemer no one in that part of the country thought for a moment that old joe skeel would trick mrs manning with a useless deed but mrs manning for some rea- son had not recorded her deed and ranley had filed his for record on advice of friends mrs manning held possession of the claim the sympathy of the mining district was all with her the law seemed to be on ranleys side but he was not popular and feared re- sults if he proceeded to law and ousted mrs manning from the claim by legal process it was condons idea that ranley had hired jim higgins to secure mrs man- nings deed with that legal instru- ment out of the way ranley might in time secure possession of the dolly var- den property with your help condon finished we have recovered the deed for mrs manning bill ranley is a tinhorn and jim higgins is a sneak thief in view of all this i cant understand why you should want to have anything more to do with a rascal like higgins wilkinson looked thoughtfully at his half-burned cigar tar and feathers he remarked along with a ride out of buenas noches on a rail would be abouf the right thing for bill ranley tll furnish the feathers and active co- operation condon if youll find the tar and round up a crowd of indignant citizens if youre willing to rough things up with ranley inquired condon why handle jim higgins with gloves wilkinson grew thoughtful he con- tinued finally napoleon g pendex- ter is a good old scout he is a real man in some things but a weak brother in others since he roamed around this benighted region with pecos pete pen- dexter has become a financial power he juggles with millions and in most ways he is an open-handed open- minded plutocrat youd think now that lies on the pleasant side of easy street and hobnobbing with governors senators and captains of finance and industry that hed want to forget these deserts and an old hassayamper like pecos pete but no he looks back on his free hard life amid this sand rogue or hero  and cactus with reverence and longing and in his study in his hollywood pal- ace he has fastened to the wall a plate of gold with this inscription  in mem- ory of pecos pete the best friend nap pendexter ever had can you beat it condons cigar had gone out his wits seemed to have gone out too for he sat in the canvas chair with his head bowed and his chin on his breast half dozing it seemed to wilkinson and only half listening now wilkinson went on pen- dexter has a son named hugh hugh had more money to spend than was good for him and a lot of it went to buy american beauties for chorus girls at fifty dollars a throw and wine sup- pers with five-dollar tips to the waiters and checks that made even his pluto- crat dad sit up and take notice you see hughs dad had billed hugh to play the lead in a wedding with a lady of the patrician class named hortense llewellyn-crosby daughter of a rail- road president and ex-senator and hughs stage-door activities rather marred the prospects dad stepped on hughs behavior with all the determina- tion of his two hundred and twenty- five pounds avoirdupois you might think hugh was flattened out condon but you have another guess coming continued wilkinson he said he wouldnt marry any girl who was named hortense and if dad didnt like it he could do the other thing the other thing was this hugh was sent to buenas noches with instructions to look over the scenes of the elder pendexters early beginnings-the idea being to inspire hugh to better things by intimate association with dutch- mans hill the caves of the cattywam- pus and hardly able flat while drawing inspiration from the desert country hugh was to receive a regular allowance when he reached the point where the name hortense appealed to him he could come back to los angeles and hollywood and not before the scheme worked out in unex- pected fashion hugh got acquainted with some desert girl the daughter of a prospector and completely forgot there ever was a lady named hortense his father wrote him to give up the desert girl or cease bearing the hon- ored pendexter name and never darken the hollywood doors again as near as i can figure out that is what hugh did he quite calling himself pen- dexter and went from bad to worse i suppose hes married to the desert girl now and has become a hard character napoleon g began an ambitious career in these parts but it looks as if hugh is ending a career among these deserts -a career that sheds mighty little luster on the name of pendexter what makes you think thatr de- manded condon looking up wtiy this answered wilkinson when i found higgins lying at the foot of the cliff shamming unconscious- ness in order to court the friendly in- terest of mrs manning i found in his pocket a very fine gold watch hooked cn to a cheap leather chain the watch -wilkinsons voice grew hard-bore the monogram h a p  condon bounded out of his chair what he exclaimed the watch bore the monogram of hugh pendex- ter exactly said wilkinson napo- leon g is a friend of mine i have a contract with him for half a dozen pic- tures but if i can do him a good turn not in the contract i dont see how i can pass it up do you no returned condon warmly and reached out and clasped wilkinsons hand you are a good sort wilkin- son and now i understand why you are disposed to look after jim higgins im amalgamator in the seven stars mill a few miles from here but i call at the manning adobe pretty regularly  top-notch magazine  if i can be of any help to you i wish you would call on me and if you can be of any help to mrs manning in her differences with ranley i hope i can count on you you can right from the jump ill go back to the adobe with the deed condon observed turning to his horse but well see each other again wilkinson it wont be my fault if we dont condon the buckskin spurred tu a gallop left the arroyo and headed toward the dolly varden claim chapter iv in the box canon roctor wells in a dusty road- ster trailed sam and the flivver out from buenas noches wilkinson headed off the two machines at the mouth of the arroyo and informed the doctor that the man he had been called to attend had recovered and left for parts unknown who sent for me inquired doctor wells i did said wilkinson ten dollars said doctor wells sam hooray looked horrified wil- kinson dug down and brought up a bill the bill changed hands if i wasnt rockybilt or vandefeller remarked the artist id rather be doctor wells the doctor put away the bill with a chuckle you see he confided pleasantly i went to school for this lood-by farewell doc wilkinson answered and watched the roadster melt away in the evening dusk almost i should call if highway rob- bery breathed sam cut out the almost sam and well be unanimous while sam was cooking supper on the collapsible stove wilkinson gave him a resume of recent events dont become fooled with this jim higgins by all means mr wilk begged the jap exkoos for making suggestion in two days wilkinson finished his work at dutchmans hill lnexpcct- edly he found his labor taking a pleas- ant turn miss manning and alonzo condon came in the afternoon to watch him paint and to chat with him and on the evening of the second day he was invited to the manning adobe for supper both women and the amalga- mator expressed regret because he was leaving the arroyo so soon for the box canon oh ill be back said wilkinson you see i must paint a picture of rattlesnake cliff and this adobe theyre mixed up with the early activi ties of napoleon g pendexter and he put them in our contract a day was consumed by wilkinson and sam in packing up moving to the box canon and unpacking again they pitched camp on hardly able flat which lay conveniently in an elbow of the gulch this flat with its lone cottonwood was to be the subject of another painting thus from that one camp on the catty wampus the artist would clean up on one-third of his con- tract for six pictures in the early days there had been placcrings in the box canon to this gravel bench prospectors had been in the habit of coming to pan out grub- stakes thirty years before nap pen- dexter and pecos pete mcgaffney had been in the habit of raiding the bench for the wherewithal to keep them going in the hills the gravel and black sand had long since been mulcted of the last trace of color but pendexter wanted the old bench done in oils so it could be hung on the walls of his study as exhibit b in the case of pendexter ver- sus fortune exhibit a was dutchmans hill on that uplift young pendexter double- rogue or iiero  crossed by luck and discouraged to the point where he had thought of mak- ing away with himself had slept and dreamed his dream was that his buck- skin mule tired and fretful had kicked him two miles into a valley marked with two needle spires of granite and a rock- ing stone as big as a house it was certainly a tremendous dream and would have been humorous had it not had such far-reaching results in alighting from his flight through the air pendexters dream had landed him in the valley directly below the rock- ing stone there he had found riches in the shape of a true fissure vein so rich in gold that the shock of the dis- covery awoke pendexter and he had opened his eyes to the hard realities of dutchmans hill rejoined by his partner pecos pete pendexter had related his dream pete considered it a good omen and the two went hunting for the valley of the twin rock spires and the rocking stone in their search they found the dolly var- den claim on which they filed and later sold to joe skeel the money secured from skeel the partners used up in fur- ther useless hunting for the valley that had so long eluded them out of grub and money the two repaired to the box canon and uncovered a pocket that netted them a bagful of dust and nug- gets they started for buenas noches to get their supplies but were waylaid on hardly able flat by an outlaw named vanette with a crowd of roughs at his back known far and wide as the tar heel gang in the fight that followed pecos pete was killed under the lone cotton- wood the bullet which struck pete down was fired by cady vanette him- self and had been intended for pen- dexter  but pete in thrusting pendex- ter out of the bullets path himself got in the way of the flying lead with fatal results that the sounds of com- bat had been heard by a party of dry washers who rushed to the rescue and saved pendexter and the bag of gold did not form the telling climax of the plutocrats reminiscences in after years he thought only of the effacement of pecos pete to the end that his loved partner had not lived and gone forward with him in fortune to such splendid results pendexter had told all this to wil- kinson in the luxurious study of the hollywood palace pete and me was brothers pendexter had said falling into the old colloquial strain which at times cropped out in spite of the pa- tient schooling of his wrife him and me starved together thirsted together and took all the hard knocks together the hard part of it was wilkinson that poor old pete ws snuffed out just be- fore the finding of the gold in ojo caliente valley i cant never forgive fate for that id spend all ive got to find cady vanette and put him through for what he done to pete directly after the fight with the tar heel crowd pendexter gloomy over the loss of his partner and striving to forget his sorrows in wandering about the hills looked around him on a cer- tain mid-afternoon and found he was in the valley he had dreamed about the big strike in ojo caliente was the result pendexter sold out for a mil- lion which grew into other millions with rapidity at a wave of the wand of speculation the scene by the rolling stone in which pendexter met the expert sent to examine the ojo caliente property and two representatives of the omaha syndicate who had hired the expert wras to be the subject of the final painting of the series perhaps a great mans weakness was exposed in this set of pictures but it was a very human weakness and en- nobled by loyalty to a comrade long dead and gone pendexter was proud of his desert record he wished to  top-notcii magazine have it visualized in landmarks on the walls of his study and he felt that it should be an inspiration to every young man who experienced difficulty in get- ting ahead in this particular instance there was too much ego in pendexters ideas the plutocrat as a prospector had jr- belled at his name of napoleon in later life he gloried in it and sought to trace a physical resemblance between himself and the little corsican there was absolutely no physical resemblance but in wilkinsons final picture at the rolling stone pendexter was to be sketched with his right arm in the breast of his coat his left hand at his back and his attitude that of the exile looking seaward from the island of st helena of course the plutocrat had said theres one difference between me and napoleon he had his waterloo and that is something nobody is ever going to hand to old nap pendexter the box canon was the worst place imaginable in which to paint a picture tn the part of it that held the old gravel bench twilight prevailed during the brightest hours of the day wilkin- sons nimble fancy was required here if he was to put on canvas a recogniza- ble bit of pendexters early experiences he proceeded to do his best however and in a few days sam hooray said the result would be perfect if wilkinson would paint a stork in the lower right- hand corncr standing on one leg and swallowing a fish a stork is all right sam said wil- kinson but it would be a long way from home in this cattywampus cation well have to spoil the picture by leav- ing it out and anyhow i dont think i could stand on one leg and paint a stork you are very jolly boy mr wilk returned sam chuckling softly and re- spectfully the cattywampus in past ages had gouged the canon out of the desert but to look at the stream one would never have guessed it had had so much energy in these latter days the catty- wampus appeared to have stopped run- ning and to be loafing in pools be- tween the pools a cloud of dust could be kicked out of the river bed ap- pearances are never more deceitful however than in the case of these des- ert watercourses they flow beneath the surface usually and appear only where bed rock forces them into view and there are times when a cloudburst in the mountains will make of a thin trickle of water a raging torrent there was a spring by the camp on hardly able flat ft brimmed over the edge of a little basin rolled away to a pool and lost its waters in the sands of the canon the week had passed the picture of the worn-out placerings wa finished and wilkinson was squaring away to sketch in the flat when jim higgins arrived he was about two days over- due and in a tearing hurry afoot his hat gone and his brown corduroys showing signs of hard usage he came down the canon like a frightened deer a crack of firearms accompanied his approach bullets tossing up little gey- sers of dust around his swiftly moving feet he collided with sam and the force of the impact knocked sam out of his way the next moment higgins had dived headlong into the tent leav- ing wilkinson and sam to face half a dozen enraged mexicans chapter v a matter of tact vhlkinson was armed with noth- ing more dangerous than a pal- ette and a paintbrush sam had his two hands and a working knowledge of jujutsu the two stepped shoulder to shoulder in front of the tent and con- fronted the six swarthy and excited rogue or hero  pursuers of jim higgins meeting this unexpected opposition the mexicans halted and held their fire whats the matter with you men wilkinson inquired the gringo is muy malol barked one of the swarthy crowd we get him you bet he ranleys amigo- no good this man tried to duck into the tent between wilkinson and sam wilkin- son dropped the palette and brush and caught the man by the collar of his cotton shirt not so fast he said and heaved the mexican backward you fellows behave it wont do for you to make a case of homicide out of thi no sabe homicide well it means bump- ing off the gringo-a thing that would lc pretty serious for all of you sup- pose we talk about this a little go over there and sit down in the shade of the cottonwood wilkinson turned to the jap sam he went on get half a dozen packages of smoking to- bacco out of our supplies and pass em around sam hesitated no doubt it looked to him like an awful waste of tobacco wilkinson repeated the order with firm- ness however and sam carried it out this was tact rice paper accompa- nied the tobacco the mexicans put away their firearms and began rolling cigarettes sam sighed heavily as the six bags went into six shirt pockets and the pursuers began to smoke the mellowing influence of the weed became apparent at once the disturb- ance took on a more tractable form sam remained at the tent to watch hig- gins while wilkinson led the mexicans to the cottonwood where all dropped down comfortably in the shade then the calise of the flight and pursuit de- veloped by degrees the six men were wood haulers one of them sanchez had a mining claim sanchez had been doing his assessment work right along that day he and his friends on their way into the hills for mesquite and paloverde had passed close enough to the claim to see bill ranley and jim higgins taking down the location notice of sanchez and tack- ing up one of ranleys in other words the buenas noches mining shark was jumping the claim 	sanchez immediately saw red end his indignant friends were with him to a man they rushed the pair at the center monument catching them at a disadvantage ranley had been bowled over quickly lashed with rope and then left in charge of a mexican sanchez and the remaining five of his com- panions had taken after higgins the chase had led them into the box canon and to the camp of the landscape painter after they killed higgins sanchez pleasantly remarked while rolling a second cigarette they wrould return to ranley and put him out of the way wilkinson could see that he was go- ing to need more tact so he had sam open a can of marmalade and spread it thick on six slices of bread this hand-out was passed around while it was being enjoyed wilkinson began his persuasions bill ranley judging from what wil- kinson had heard of him was a scoun- drel no doubt hanging or shooting was too good for him but americano law was peculiar for one man to slay another even when that other deserved it was bad form  in fact the law dealt harshly with men who made themselves instruments of justice to the extent of eliminating rogues like ranley wil- kinson declared earnestly that he was explaining this point to the mexicans for their own good and he hoped they would understand it as to the claim jumping that had been nipped in the bud ranley had been halted at the right moment jim higgins the man in the tent was  top-notch magazine merely a tool of ranleys he had just happened to be with ranley at the claim of course if a fellow is caught in bad company he usually has to stand the consequences but if it wasnt wise for the mexicans to massacre ranley it would be less wise for them to pro- ceed to extremities with higgins wasnt that plain just how much of an impression wil- kinson made on the wood haulers with this carefully chosen line of talk he never knew he finished his argument just as the last of the bread and mar- malade disappeared sanchez was reaching for the makings and thoughtfully considering what he had heard when suddenly the quiet was broken by four shots from down the canon the firing was done in a pecul- iar manner two reports in quick suc- cession an interval of silence then two more reports all the mexicans leaped to their feet excitedly and turned won- dering eyes on sanchez pablo sanchez explained the next moment he was off at his best speed his five companions trailing after him wilkinson was surprised and disappointed he felt that he had had sanchez and his crowd coming his way and that his tact would brilliantly have justified itself but for that ill- timed shooting curious to learn what was going on down the canon he took after the mexicans stay here and hang on to higgins sam he called as he ran past the tent his course carried him beyond the old placerings and around a turn in the canon walls there at a place described to him by pendexter as the cattvwam- pus caves he overtook sanchez and his friends another mexican was added to the crowd-a wild-eyed man with his left forearm bound in a ban- danna handkerchief this man was talking rapidly to sanchez and evi- dently explaining something when he had made an end sanchez turned to wilkinson this mexican is pablo said he ranley get away from pablo shoot him in arm run away to canon below here and lose himself in the caves pablo come after him shoot to let us know where he is and watch to see ranley not get out sanchez swore in a mellifluous and highly expressive manner you good amigo he added you talk fine but i not care for americano law por dios we wait here we shoot like a dog this ranley when he comes out and then we take what medicine we have to there was no use trying further ar- guments on sanchez this last exploit of ranleys had still further enraged the mexicans and they were deter- mined to have their revenge on the mining shark wilkinson withdrew to a distance and sat down on a bowlder the caves had been worn out of the canon wall by action of the water they w-ere holes of irregular shape penetrating the bosom of the cliff in a honeycomb formation pendexter knew the caves well and wilkinson searched his memory for all he had said about them one point took clearer and clearer shape in the artists recollec- tions pendexter had said that there was a secret way out of the caves where the water had seeped through a strata of the rocks and emerged to the river bed a hundred feet below the boles that formed the main entrance wil- kinson was about to tell sanchez about this but on second thought he kept the information to himself getting off the bowlder he strolled on down the canon looking sharply for a mass of granite that hid the secret exit if ranley knew about that hid- den gallery no doubt he would make his escape through it perhaps in fact he had already used his knowledge to that end wiikinson after a few min- utes found the splinter of rock at the rogue or hero  cliffs foot just as pendexter had de- scribed it between the spur and the cliff half concealed by trailing vines was the black maw of the passage w il- kinson stepped into it curiously he groped his way along between the un- even walls and he kept groping finally making a turn which brought him io a spot where faint gleams of day entered through the openings guarded by the mexicans howd you get in here demanded some one in guarded tones that was ranley no doubt of it wilkinson drew back startled then he stepped forward again ready to carry out a program that had occurred to him abruptly like a happy thought youre bill ranley he asked youve made a bulls-eye first clat- ter was the answer youre no greaser i can see that even in this in- fernal gloom who are you whats your business with me and howd you get here my names wilkinson- oh exclaimed the other the cim- iroon higgins was telling me about what- wait a minute the mexicans out there are waiting to do you up ranley if you want to save your scalp youll have to parley with me i can get you out of here and the mexicans wont know a thing about it youre a regular friend wilkinson those greasers have me cornered but if you can show me how to fool em maybe i can make it up to you some time howll we work it  theres a condition ranley wil- kinson went on two conditions in fact the first one is that youve got to promise to leave the man you call jim higgins alone youre making an all-around villain out of that young fel- low ill not have it i know more about him than you imagine all right agreed ranley promptly whats the other condition p tn youve got to stop trying to beat mrs manning out of the dolly  ar- den claim it belongs to her if youve got something to write on and to write with ill hold matches while you make a written statement to this effect my quitclaim deed to the dolly varden property is a forgery mrs manning is the legal owner and from now hence- forth i will do whatever is-demanded of me to restore her to full legal owner- ship of the property write that sign it and i will witness it what do you take me for de- manded ranley not for a fool ranley whatever else i take you for im giving you your chance do what i ask of you and ill let you out by the secret way i came in if theres a secret way ill find it growled ranley and ill not let you put a crimp into me try to get out and the mexicans will put a crimp into you went on wilkinson it will take me about a minute to tell them where to go to head you off ranley muttered under his breath if there were any bullets in this six- shooter of mine he said venomously id call your little game right here wilkinson but yotive got all the trumps ive got a location notice in my pocket and a fountain pen give me a little light what was that you wanted me to say ranley laid the location notice against a smooth section of the wall blank side up and while wilkinson looked over his shoulder and burned matches and dictated the mining shark did his writ- ing the dolly varden prospect is more trouble than its worth anyway said ranley giving up the written docu- ment but i hate like blazes to be euchred out of it in a way like this now i reckon the people in the min-  top-notch magazine ing district will leave me alone show me the way out turn to the right and move straight ahead said wilkinson ill trail along stumblingly the two made their way along the gloomy bore and finally reachcd daylight cautiously ran ley peered around the curtain of granite that masked the secret exit then whirl- ing suddenly he caught wilkinson by the shoulders and hurled him back against the rocks the artist was dazed by the suddenness of the attack be- fore he could rally his wits and inter- fere ranley had snatched the folded document out of his pocket and bounded off into the canon sanchez yelled wilkinson heres your man sanchez he raced after ranley only to have the surprise of his life flashed before his bewildered eyes hoofs pounded the sandy bed of the river and three riders raced into view one of them tow- ing a horse with an empty saddle the man leading the horse was jim higgins the other two were girdled with weap- ons and of a vicious and threatening aspect just in the nick peabody cried ranley jumping for the led horse and vaulting into the saddle you shore made a mix of it this time bill growled the old wrinkle- faced ruffian called peabody whos the yap over there he asked nodding toward wilkinson pendexters hired man said ran- ley i just fooled him i want to know exclaimed pea- body and gave the artist a sizing with his wicked little eyes lets ride urged jim higgins nervously ride ir is answered peabody spurs rattled hoofs pounded the sand and the four men vanished at speed down the canon wilkinson dropped heavily on a bowlder removed his hat and ran his fingers through his hair tag j w he mumbled gloom- ily  youre it chapter vi striking a snag iack wilkinson had experienced j a decided shock the tact on which he was priding himself as he would have stated it had suddenly left him what had become of the mexicans iiow had jim higgins succeeded in getting away from sam something must have happened to sam wilkin- son reasoned and he went back up the canon to find out in about two min- utes the mystery was made plain the little jap was sitting on the ground in front of the tent a stick had been thrust under his lifted knees and then his arms had been drawn for- ward beneath the stick and his hands hound together at the wrists across his shins he couldnt move but he had the use of his tongue and was saying things in pure and emphatic nipponese judging from the accent of his whoops grunts and falling inflections his dis- position had undergone a strain and his nerves had buckled there are others sam said wil- kinson busy with the knotted rope dont think for a minute that youre the only one to shake hands with johnny i-iardluck here on the raging catty- wampus we have been impractical about this business matter sam declared getting on his feet and kicking out his cramped legs i am twenty-four of my age and to le caught so is great calamity of judgment sam explained that two men had come down the canon riding two horses and leading two the strangers were armed and of evil disposition jim higgins had come out of the tent and made for one of the led horses sam had interfered and then the men with rogue ok hero  the guns had pointed grim muzzles at him and had made him sit down while the stick and the rope were adjusted then the newcomers with higgins had ridden down the canon and pretty soon sanchez and the other mexicans had come running back-in so much of a hurry to get away they had not stopped to release sam nor give him even a word of greeting or of explanation such was the reward for one half dozen bags of tobacco one half loaf of bread and one can of marmalade wilkinson floured the affair in this wise peabody and the other man had been waiting somewhere with their own mounts and those of ranley and higgins while the claim jumping was being carried out the disaster to ran- ley and higgins on becoming known to their waiting companions had re- sulted in a rescue they formed a hard crowd those white men what was the use in trying to do anything more for higgins he was going a desper- ate course and sooner or later would come to some bad end wilkinson would have liked to do something for higgins on account of napoleon g but fate seemed against it the artist made up his mind to give undivided attention to carrying out his contract with pendexter and for two weeks he was exceedingly busy with paint and canvas when the work in the canon was finished the camp was moved back to the arroyo by rattlesnake cliff and the dolly varden claim filled wilkinsons perspective the cliff no less than the adobe house was to have a place in that picture a pipe like the filament of a black spider web clung to the cliffs face all the way from top to bottom at the base of the sheer wall was a bicycle wheel rigged with buckets water descending through the pipe jetted into the buckets and flung the bicycle wheel around and around at mad speed a little way from this primitive water power was a wagon wheel mounted horizontally on a post a beam crossed the wheel and extended for two feet on either side of the rim to the ends of the beam a couple of stones were attached with chains the flutter wheel geared down and connected with the wagon wheel caused the wagon wheel to turn slowly the dangling stones were dragged in a circle around a groove neatly constructed of smooth bowlders this was joe skeels homemade ar- rastre mrs manning and her daughter carried ore threw it into the arrastre and the dragging stones ground the ore to powder it was toilsome work for women but yieided a return sufficient for their needs while wilkinson was painting con- don came often to watch him and talk with him cherry manning accompa- nied him occasionally it was not diffi- cult for the artist to detect the trend of affairs the amalgamator was in love with the girl and there was no doubt that the girl held him in high favor but there was something be- tween them in the nature of a barrier wilkinsons artistic temperament con- vinced him of this and he wondered what it might be that held them apart when a favorable moment offered itself wilkinson told condon of his at- tempt to clear the title of the dolly varden claim for mrs manning the amalgamators face lighted up with gratitude for thejnterest the artist had shown too bad you couldnt have won out on that play wilkinson said condon you had the right idea im posi- tive ranley forged a deed thinking it would be easy to dispossess mrs man- ning where he fell down was in fail- ing to foresee how the sympathy of the whole mining district would be with a woman whom he was trying to impose upon bill ranley is a trick scoundrel  top-notch magazine if he is allowed rope enough though hell hang himself he has been asso- ciating with a desperate crowd headed by old peabody those men are doing things the law wont stand for and sooner or later ranley will be brought up with a round turn what do you hear from napoleon g pendexter i havent heard a thing since i reached this part of the country na- poleon g lias told me what to do and he will expect me to report to him in los angeles with the six pictures one more after this and then sam and i will pull up stakes and mosey back to los what is the subject of the last pic- ture the scene is laid over in ojo cali- ente valley thats where i am-on the night shift in the seven stars mill ill bother you a good deal while youre there wilkinson the more you bother me the better ill like it the artist answered he had taken a genuine liking to condon and did not hesitate to show it but wilkinson struck a snag in ojo caliente valley pendexter had roughly- diagramed the scenes he desired repro- duced he had stood by the rocking stone when conferring with the mining expert and the representatives of the omaha syndicate and had marked the exact spot the picture was to have the rocking stone in the foreground pendexter was insistent on that point wilkinson making a preliminary trip to the valley to get his bearings made the astounding discovery that the rock- ing stone had disappeared condon explained to him that the huge bal- anced rock had been considered a men- ace and had been blown off its base and smashed to fragments by dynamite wilkinson at a loss what to do in the circumstances went to buenas noches and sent a telegram to pendexter kockmg stone gone suggest changing sccne to vicinity of twin rock spires an- swer the answer was not long in coming rocking stone historic monument was there lor thousands of years somebody must have tampered with it insist on having it in picture will come personally to help you recreate it and get it in final scene meet me thursday afternoon buenas noches wilkinson was astounded pendex- ter was wrenching himself away from his important business activities just to visit the desert country and make sure that the last picture of the series was correctly sketched what was there that he could say about the rock- ing stone that the artist could not learn and more completely from men at the seven stars mine pendexters re- membrance of the rock was dimmed by a lapse of thirty years and only two months had passed since the valley miners had blasted the rock to frag- ments pendexter however had made up his mind to come and nothing more was to be said about it there was a ripple of excitement at the seven stars mine and the dolly varden claim when wilkinson an- nounced the coming visit of the multi- millionaire condon looked grave if he comes he remarked hell probably find out about jim higgins have you written him anything about higgins wilkinson  not a word answered wilkinson w hat was the use while hes here ill try and keep him from finding out anything about jim higgins that will be best i think i think so too agreed condon mrs manning was all in a flutter over the coming of the great man hell not find things here to his liking im sure she faltered all the while he has been in cali- fornia he has dreamed about this des- ert and the scenes of his early strug- gles and triumphs said wilkinson rogue or hero  the hard knocks and the ugly reali- ties have faded out of his mental pic- ture but when he comes back to this blistering heal and the blowing sand and the ragged lonesome hills hell be due for an awakening you are right mrs manning hes not going to find things here to his liking cherry seemed distressed oh i wish he wouldnt come she exclaimed nonsense said condon and laughed let him come let him see just how much inspiration his son could draw out of dutchmans hill and the landmarks up and down the cattywam- pus maybe all that will prove an eye opener sam tried to groom to gin sama and make the flivver worthy of its task of transporting the plutocrat from buenas noches to the arroyo his ef- forts were pathetic so far as results were concerned perhaps honorable millionaire will stay in town he sug- gested we have not comforts in camp for illustrious person of such magnitude i hope hell decide to stay in town sam vilkinson returned but if he plants himself on the idea that he wants to be with us in the arroyo you might as well try to shift dutchmans hill as to move him hes the big boss and what he says goes sam looked worried and made out a list of luxuries he would have to get in town in case pendexter decided to share their camp with them on thurs- day the flivver its brasswork shining in sorry contrast with its dented and weather-worn sides pointed toward buenas noches wilkinson was at the station when the train came in and met the stout gentlensan who was ob- sequiously ushered out of the pullman by the porter the stout gentleman to the artists surprise wore olive drab khaki and wide-brimmed brown hat he looked like a general bound for the firing line hello wilkinson he called reaching for the artists hand here i am all ready for business what do you think of the uniform eh  mother reckoned i was going it pretty strong but you can bet i know whats proper for the deserts youll stay in town i suppose queried wilkinson stay in town me pendexter laughed not on your life my boy im going to get right out in tlft middle of the sun sand and solitude if you havent room for me in your wikiup then ill spread my blankets in the open it wont be the first time chapter vii a night warning dendexter was sixty years old it was his proud boast that no matter how fate dealt with him he was game calm-eyed steady-nerved he had played his first million in a stock gamble to double or lose he had won and financially he had continued win- ning ever since he had had his first stern lesson on dutchmans hill where he had once thought of self-destruc- tion had dreamed of fortune and had lived to see his dream come true but it was not his adventures in money mat- ters that proved him game so much as the manner in which he bore the sorrow and disappointment that had come to him through his only son  he had built his hopes on the boy and they bad been high and splendid all his plans had been leveled like a house of cards too little restraint and too much money had proved the un- doing of hugh and he had been sent into the southwest to commune with the deserts and to find himself there he had still further defied his fathers plans for his career and had been cast off and forced to go it alone pen- dexter had charted the course he was to follow with hugh and held to it  top-notch magazine with spartan determination ilis wifes health was almost broken by the blow and his own heart was scarred and em- bittered but pendexter did not waver he fell that he was doing his duty he prided himself on being game on his first night in camp pendexter stood in the mouth of the arroyo and looked across the level desert toward dutchmans hill there was a moon and the ugliness of the hill under the sun glare had given way to the dim loveliness of a landscape under a night sky powdered with stars and glowing with a silver radiance wilkinson stood at pendexters side and for the first time dutchmans hill made a distinct appeal to him 	the spell of the moment was upon pendexter he talked of hugh as he had never talked to wilkinson before what he said let in the side lights upon his character laying bare the wound which at other times he kept carefully hidden wilkinson  inferred from what was said that part of pendexters purpose in coming to buenas noches was to learn whatever he could about his son a wave of dread rolled over the artist what if pendexter was to succeed in getting the truth concerning hugh no doubt realizing that he was saying more than he should pendexter turned abruptly and made his way back to the camp in something else too pendexter was game all the inconveniences and hardships of camp life he bore with a cheerful and uncomplaining spirit he laughed that first night as he shook a scorpion out of his blankets by jiminv but that was like the old times he washed in the tin basin ate out of tin dishes held on his knees and drank coffee with condensed milk and brown sugar trimmings out of a tin cup his appetite was good and he seemed to enjoy the meal sam hooray thawed toward him i have not had the collegical life illus- trious sir said sam but i observe closely with what simple education i possess exkoos if i say you are re- markably fine sport for one of exalted rank allow me if i admire this was the sort of talk from sam that pendexter enjoyed the japs twist of speech and elaborate politeness were refreshing following breakfast that first morning pendexter suggested a call at the dolly varden claim wil- kinson accompanied him when they came within sight of the arrastre they saw mrs manning and her daughter carrying baskets of ore and emptying them under the dragging stones why dont they hire some man to do that  inquired pendexter pretty hard work for a couple of women wilkinson explained that not enough gold was recovered lo warrant the ex- pense of hiring a man while he and pendexter stood in the shade and watched wilkinson told about ranley and his designs on the claim pendex- ter waxed wrathful and indignant joe skeel was square as a die he declared if he gave the claim to mrs manning you can gamble there was no deed given to ranley its a plain case of steal and the woman should be protected they went on to the arrastre and the artist introduced the rich man to mrs manning and her daughter the ladies were evidently embarrassed they had been surprised at the rough work which their hard fate made necessary cherry in particular seemed taken aback a flush of color ran through her brown face but she carried herself with dig- nity wilkinson had never seen her more charming than at that moment pendexter was all politeness and con- sideration a pard of mine and my- self discovered this dolly varden claim maam said he to mrs manning we even figured out the possibilities of the spring on top of the cliff and the lim- ited amount of water power for this rogue or hero  sort of work he nodded toward the arrastre we sold out to joe skeel he went on and left it to him to de- velop the power id like to look at the adobe may i  mrs manning led the way to the house looking back wilkinson saw cherry staring after pendexter a strange wondering expression on her face the adobe had been built by pendex- ter and pecos pete mcgaffney the structure had been added to by joe skeel but the original mud walls held a powerful appeal to pendexter the last time i stood in this adobe i was pretty low in fortune the nabob re- marked thirty years pete and i did a lot of planning here-and pete never lived to see the end of it good old pete mcgaffney no better man or truer friend ever lived there was a rasping note in pendex- ters voice he changed the subject ab- ruptly you never can develop this claim properly working it as you are he said id be glad to help you get some machinery in here-if youd let me just for old times sake he added that is good of you returned mrs manning but there is only one way t can be helped my title to the claim is disputed i want the property clear you see a man named bill ranley- wilkinson has been telling me about ranley the other broke in i know the circumstances joe skeel was square and ranley is trying to put one over ill see that man and maybe i can do something it will be a pleas- ure he finished and stopped mrs mannings protestations of gratitude on the way back to the arroyo pen- dexter apparently had two ideas in mind one dealt with mrs manning and her daughter theres something fine about that girl he said and its a pity she must be held down to a hard life like this maybe i can persuade her mother to let me do something to help develop the claim and make life easier for both of them before i leave buenas noches you can bank on it that ill give ranley a bad half hour his other idea had to do with pete mcgaffney cady yanette never an- swered to the law for the shooting of pete he said vanette if living must be pretty well along in years by now i f i could get track of that scoun- drel and have him brought to book id consider diat i had done something for pete years ago i tried to get track of vanette and sent a detective out here from los angeles the detective reported that the fellow had disap- peared maybe yanette has gone the long trail i dont know in the afternoon wilkinson and pen- dexter were to take the car and ride to ojo caliente valley while they were waiting for sam to get the noon meal ready the artist showed his pic- tures one by one pendexter sat back and studied the pictures as they were placed before him he said nothing until the last canvas was exhibited and then he leaned over and patted wilkin- son on the shoulder i had to pay you a good price to come out here and do these for me he said but i wanted the best man i could get for the job and did not mind the expense you have certainly filled the bill wilkinson now if we can fix up that rocking stone we will- he halted abruptly a portfolio of charcoal sketches lay open on a bowl- der where wilkinson had left it in get- ting out pendexters penciled diagrams of what he wanted in the half dozen pictures pendexters eyes had dropped to the charcoal sketches and had been caught and held by the study of a head -a mans head with snaky eyes a lean leather- wrinkled face and a startling expression of viciousness and abandon he turned from wilkinson walked over to the portfolio and picked up the  top-notch magazine sketch when did you do this he demanded a week ago wilkinson answered a fancy sketch no from the life tell me about it said pendexter smothering his eagerness the artist told about the incident in the box canon carefully shielding his speculations regarding jim higgins his finding of ranley in the river caves was gone into in detail and he strove to put a little humor into his unsuc- cessful attempt to corner the mining shark and help mrs manning the rescue of ranley by the old ruffian finished the recital thats the old ruffians phiz mr pendexter explained wilkinson it sort of haunted me so i got it down in a rough sketch it-it reminds me of cady yan- ette averred pendexter of cady yanette as he might be thirty years after he killed pete mcgaffney heres another man i want to see and to learn something about instead of going to ojo caliente valley this afternoon sup- pose we go to buenas noches and talk with an officer wilkinson felt that pendexter must be mistaken in his eagerness to find yanette his judgment was playing him false but the trip to the valley was postponed and an excursion was made to town reeves the deputy sheriff was found and pendexter was intro- duced to him reeves declared that wilkinsons charcoal sketch was a dead ringer for a troublesome old rawhide called peabody the deputy didnt know much about peabody except that he appeared and disappeared appar- ently had no visible means of support nor fixed place to stay and was be- lieved to be a hard character and the author of several deeds of lawlessness bill ranley had been seen with pea- body on several occasions and possibly ranley could give some information about him-if he would the three of them called at ranleys office only to find a card on the door bearing the words out of town im going to be in this part of the country for a few days reeves said pendexter in parting from the deputy and ill give you a thousand dollars if youll find this peabody and bring him to me i think i know the fellow but i cant be dead certain of it until i meet him and talk with him ill do my best to corral that thou- sand mr pendexter reeves declared all the way back to the arroyo pen- dexter was preoccupied with his thoughts he broke the silence once to observe that it would be a remarka- ble thing if peabody turned out to be cady vanette in his own mind wil- kinson agreed with him as a coinci- dence it would be so remarkable as to be impossible pendexters judg- ment the artist thought was being warped by his overwhelming desire to avenge the taking off of pecos pete mcgaffney justice after thirty years is apt to miss the blind trails pendexter retired to bis blankets early that night sam about the same time curled up in the tonneau of the flivver and his snores filled the quiet air wilkinson with his pipe sat in one of the canvas chairs he was be- ginning to realize that he had a job on his hands in looking after napoleon g the plutocrat had already started to make things warm for peabody on the strength of a crayon sketch and the idea that the subject of it was vanette and he had scheduled for himself a warm session with ranley in behalf of mrs manning stirring up the bad men of the desert in such a way was sure to lead to un- pleasant results all around pendexter in the middle of a blighted wilderness and miles from the protection of the law might catch more calamity on the rebound than would be good for him rogue or hero  this was the prospect that worried wil- kinson and it was more than a pros- pect  it was a real foreboding the reflections of the artist were broken in upon by a figure that ap- peared suddenly and silently around the side of the tent it was a shadowy figure not carrying itself in a threaten- ing manner but startling wilkinson nevertheless i want to talk with you a moment wilkinson came in a familiar voice come this way will you dont arouse anybody youre the one i want to see and only you it was condon blowing in on the arroyo camp at a time when he was supposed to be on duty in the seven stars mill the artist smothered his surprise and accompanied the visitor to a little distance where they could talk without disturbing pendexter or sam whats on your mind condon wil- kinson inquired the amalgamator appeared to be very much wrought up pendexter is in danger he said reeves is out with a posse combing the hills for pea- body it has come straight to ojo cal- iente valley that peabody has sworn hell not be taken alive and also that hell do his best to get pendexter for starting this trouble condon drew a long rasping breath whats the meaning of it all he demanded wilkinson explained that pendexter thought peabody was none other than vanette long wanted for the taking off of mcgaffney theres not one chance in a million tiiat the old boy has got his bean down on the right number the artist added but hes loaded to the muzzle on this fool proposition and has got to explode i was just think- ing about this condon when you showed up pendexter doesnt realize what it means to make an enemy out of pea- body condon went on youve got to tell him wilkinson urge him to stop fooling with that desert gunman and have him take the next train back to los angeles he isnt safe here a minute now pass my warning along to him but dont tell him where it came from in fact and here condons voice grew intensely earnest dont say a word to pendexter about me one way or the other reeves didnt lose any time getting busy remarked wilkinson the offer of a thousand dollars hooked him pendexter didnt tell reeves to ar- rest peabody but just to bring him in for a talk peabody looks at that as a distinc- tion without much of a difference no doubt theres something in his past that he thinks pendexter has uncovered peabody is a desperate old rascal wil- kinson and he is not making empty threats persuade pendexter to go back home you might as well ask me to per- suade pikes peak to move down into new mexico said wilkinson when napoleon g takes the bit in his teeth hes going straight ahead and you couldnt make him gee-haw with dyna- mite im going to do what i can but i tell you now it will be a mistake youre putting yourself to a lot of trou- ble on his account wilkinson added it would be a terrible thiig to have an influential man like pendexter wiped out by a worthless old coot like pea- body its up to you perhaps to keep such a disaster from happening do what you can wilkinson condon led his horse out from the shadowy chaparral and vaulted into the saddle the best way to stave off disaster is to have reeves capture peabody as soon as possible the artist suggested im afraid hes too cunning for reeves was the reply if you cant get pendexter to go back to cali for- i 	v	top-notcii nia then do what you can to protect him so long  condon whirled his horse and gal- loped off wilkinson watched him un- til he had melted away into the shadows of the desert trail chapter viii a bcndli of money nt ext morning after breakfast wil-   kinsou tried to convince pendexter that camping out in the hills was bad for his health he suggested that they go to ojo caliente valley at once get the rocking stone and surroundings sketched in accordance with pendex- ters fancy and then hurry pendexter to buenas noches so he could catch the afternoon train for los angeles the magnate of the coast wouldnt hear of it he had made up his mind to knock around the deserts for a week at least there was business for him to attend to right there in the hills it would take more than a day to get the van- ished rocking stone satisfactorily re- created in fancy and on its base in the valley in fact pendexter declared he had made up his mind to hang around until that final picture of the series was finished then again reeves might corral peabody at any moment if the old scoundrel was really cady vanette pendexter wouldnt miss put- thing him through for what he had done to mcgaffney for a million dol- lars on top of that there was the dolly varden business to be looked after pendexter had pledged his word to talk with bill ranley and do what he could to help mrs manning as for his health-and here the nabob of los angeles and hollywood laughed-why he had never felt better in his life wilkinson had done his duty he had known very well that nothing he could say would hurry pendexter out of the country to hint at personal magazine danger would only have drawn another laugh and the artist had been wise to keep that angle of the situation in the background napoleon g was in the desert to stay until he was good and ready to entrain for home there was no prying him loose from the perilous country nor from the perilous business to which he had set his hand nor would napoleon g go to ojo caliente valley that morning there was no particular hurry about that and he had planned to call on mrs manning once more and learn further particulars re- garding the chicanery of the mining shark pendexter went alone to the dolly varden claim he hadnt been gone ten minutes from the camp when sam emerged from the tent where he had been rolling up the blankets and putting things to rights and handed wilkinson a fat wallet the carelessness of wealthy persons is difficult matter to comprehend sam remarked hon- orable pendexter leaves pocketbook un- der pillow for first man coming along to pick up please count contents of purse mr wilk should anything be gone i desire to be guaranteed inno- cent wilkinson opened the pocketbook and a bundle of brown-backed paper money was revealed he thumbed over the bills and found that they to- taled five thousand dollars carrying that much money in a country like this is what i call a crime said wilkinson if known sam returned it would be invitation to holdup rascals to com- mit lawlessness please to take charge of money mr wilk my mind will be very much released by shifting re- sponsibility he went back into the tent with the pocketbook open on his knees and the bundle of bills lying upon it in plain view wilkinson sat in the canvas chair wondering at the reckless- rogue or hero  ness of men of wealth why had pen- dexter brought all that cold cash with him  he ought to have known better if some men in that lawless wilderness ever learned that so much treasure was to be had by a quick raid then- wheres this multimillionaire pen- dexter i heard from reeves that you and him were at my office yesterday looking for me wilkinson lifted his eyes with a start bill ranley stood in front of him look- ing hard at the money a dozen yards in the background stood ranleys horse the mining shark must have ap- proached the camp with care and cau- tion or wilkinson would have heard him the secret of the money was out one of the slyest most unprincipled rogues in that section had discovered it wilkinson was glad pendexter was not around after the first shock had passed he began using his wits mr pendexter is not here at pres- ent ranley remarked the artist pick- ing up the bills in a seemingly careless manner and toying with them in a way that showed their denomination he wanted to talk with you about the dolly varden deed i think he can talk but he cant bluff me ranley could not take his gaze off the money whenll he be back ill wait here and talk with him if youll be in your office this after- noon ill tell him about it and maybe hell make another call hes got busi- ness to attend to just at present wil- kinson slipped the money into the wal- let and pushed it into his pocket i don t know that i can go with him to town though at three this afternoon im starting for hardly able flat to wind up a little deal the deal has nothing to do with painting pictures he confided youre going to pay over all that money for a mining claim eh  queried ranley dont jump at conclusions sug- gested wilkinson you wouldnt be fool enough to have so much of the long green about you if you wasnt calculatin on paying it out insisted ranley its a private matter while im attending to it my man can drive mr pendexter to town to see you when will you be in your office  ranley reflected make it three- thirty he said finally all right said wilkinson without another word ranley made for his horse mounted and spurred away sam wide-eyed stood looking out of the tent his face was troubled mr wilk exkoos he said but you are not planning expedition to canon alone with such vast amount of wealth  hardly answered wilkinson forget it sam not a word about this to pendexter or any one else un- derstand  ill thank you for my gat- ling sam ducked back into the tent and returned with the six-shooter wilkin- son slipped it into his pocket and got up im going to make a hurried trip to the seven stars camp he an- nounced if mr pendexter returns before i do just tell him im away somewhere but wont be gone long thats all get that what you say mr wilk i shall do said sam gravely one must use common senses in all proceedings that concern money and such rogues as ranley sam could be depended on to carry out orders he might be curious and he might be worried but he was de- voted to wilkinson and had sublime faith in wilkinsons judgment the artist was gone an hour from the camp long before pendexter re- turned lie was back much to sams relief wilkinson couldnt sing but top-notch magazine  whenever lie was particularly pleased with the course of events he made the attempt with the flivver in it accus- tomed place and himself again in the canvas chair in the shade of the tent fly he burst into something supposed to tie song oh a bold bad man was this desperado and he blew into camp like a young tor- nado- sam was working around the gaso- line stove getting dinner ready he smiled as he worked if mr wilk was pleased then sam was pleased the jap watched his friend and employer out of the corners of his eyes wil- kinson opened a portfolio leaned one flap of it upright against the tent wall and against the flap he stood the char- coal sketch of peabody for a few minutes he studied the sketch in silence nnd then he bounded out of his chair with a whoop sam staggered and nearly dropped a skillet of bacon something is wrong please he inquired my wits have been twisted and sque- geed sam declared wilkinson and im just beginning to get them untan- gled this is beginning to look like my happy day he closed the- charcoal sketch inside the portfolio and turned to watch na- poleon g pendexter who was just turning into the arroyo pendexter had had a pleasant visit at the manning adobe he declared that mrs man- ning was a wonderful woman and that her daughter was the most charming young lady he had ever met he was going to do something for those two ladies by george he would see ran- ley and force him to clear mrs man- nings title to the dolly yarden claim then just for the girls sake he would furnish the necessary capital to develop the claim and make it a big winner wilkinson had never seen him so en- thusiastic or in a more genial mood you left this under your pillow last night said the artist offering the wal- let i thought about it while i was over at mrs mannings was the answer but  knew it would be all right better count the money mr pen- dexter  i ut tut returned pendexter and was about to transfer the long purse to his pocket without a look at its con- tents thats a beautiful wallet re- marked wilkinson where could i get one like it pendexter promptly opened the pock- etbook took out the bills and tossed the pocketbook to the artist there you are son said he and wadded up the five thousand dollars and stowed the money away in his pocket this was exactly what wilkinson had expected although he demurred out of politeness pendexter insisted and this again was exactly as wilkinson had expected we had a caller while you were awav wilkinson announced reeves no bill ranley pendexter was intensely interested at once hell meet you at his office in town at three- thirty this afternoon the artist went on why didnt you hold him here and send over to mrs mannings for me pendexter demanded i thought of sending for you but when ranley made the appointment in town i decidcd to let it go at that sam will take you to buenas noches in the car i wont go along it will probably be better for you to be alone with ran- ley when you have your seance with him this i pretty good pendexter ex- claimed im all primed for that tin- horn and hell do the right thing or ill know the reason why it was after two when pendexter and sam left the camp as soon as they were out of sight wilkinson hur- rogue or hero  ried over to the dolly varden claim and borrowed the pinto cayuse of miss manning he explained merely that he wanted to take a little ride and wouldnt be gone long perhaps miss manning w-ould keep an eye on the camp while he was gone mr pen- dexter and sam had left for town and might not be back for some little time miss manning declared that she would be glad to watch the camp and would be right over back at the tent wilkinson took some sheets of paper from a sketching pad folded them and stuffed them into pendexters wallet then pushing the wallet into his pocket he lengthened the stirrup straps of the pintos saddle mounted and rode away he had done some close figuring was it to work out successfully or not  his plan was hedged about by many contingencies and if one detail went wrong the whole idea would work to- ward failure but he was hoping for the best you put one over on me at the caves of the catty wampus ranley he was saying to himself but im gam- bling on squaring accounts by this ride toward hardly able flat some more tact and this time a little finesse if that combination doesnt get me any- where ill be ready to throw up my hands chapter ix with amazing suddenness trail not often traveled and therefore dim and uncertain left the buenas noches road and mean- dered toward cattywampus canon wilkinson had covered the course once and had no great difficulty in covering it again what he was expecting came to pass and at one stroke fate swept aside most of the contingencies that might have marred his scheme in a bit of a swale littered with bowl- der heaps he was suddenly confronted by a man on horseback leveling a re- volver with each hand the mans hat was pulled down over his eyes and his coat collar was turned up about his face when he shouted halt his voice was husky and palpably disguised having invited the holdup wilkinson had no intention of disappointing the two-gun man at least not at that stage of the proceedings he halted another man rode out from behind the same pile of rocks that had served as a screen for the first man road agent number two also carried a brace of guns and his hat and coat collar were likewise adjusted to hide his face and confuse the details of identity he took up a position in the trail behind the pinto so that wilkinson- was caught between two fires howdy gents said wilkinson please dont get nervous writh all that artillery pointed in my direction some- times these guns work on a hair trigger and turn a pleasant little joke into a fatality dont get gay grunted the man at the pintos head sourly theres a bunch of boodle in your clothes and were after it cough up wilkinson tried hard to register con- sternation he talked wildly but even as he talked he was fumbling at his coat and removing pendexters wallet from his pocket the man in front put away one of his weapons spurred alongside the pinto and snatched the fat pocketbook  reckon that will be all he snapped you ride on and ride hard look back and well pepper you git wilkinson rode about twenty feet and drew rein as a sharp command went ringing across the swale up with your hands you two quick or well drop you out of your saddles the artist looked around then and turned the pinto so a comprehensive view might be had of the whole scene topping the swale banks on left and top-notch magazine right were four mounted men with rifles the riders appearing with amazing suddenness occupied the four corners of a great square in the center of which and below were the two as- tounded road agents the rifles were deflected to command the pair in the swale and escape was impossible slowly the men on the swale banks rode downward converging upon the cen- tral point the road agents were bill ranley and jim higgins if there had been any doubt of the mens identity in wil- kinsons mind it was set at rest by the clear view he now had of the baffled faces of the pair ranley and higgins held their hands high in the air their revolvers had been put away but ran- leys hands were not empty for in one of them he clutched the long fat wal- let just taken from wilkinson this  once ranley said alonzo condon in charge of the riders from the seven stars camp you have been caught red-handed and with the goods said the artist condon you were certainly johnny on the spot ill trouble you for that wallet bill ranley scowled blackly as he gave up the wallet im in for it now i reckon snarled jim higgins and ranley swore it was a sure-thing game-just frisking a lone painter of a bunch of the long green oh well i guess i can take my medi- cine two of condons men disarmed the captives the next thing t suppose remarked condon is to take them to buenas noches and turn them over to reeves tie them to their saddles boys he added to his companions wait a minute interposed wilkin- son if i can make a deal with ran- ley to clear the title to the dolly var- den claim why not do it a gleam of hope shot through bill ranleys face if you want to talk business with me lie said curtly eet busy have you got that statement you wrote out for me over in the canon- wilkinson asked no will you write out another yes if youll agree to drop this holdup matter right here nothing more is to be done about it and im to have my liberty how about my liberty demanded jim higgins im not worryin much about you said ranley youre to give wilkinson what he wants put in condon to ranley and leave the country for good within twenty-four hours all right was the surly response give me something to write on wilkinson fished a piece of paper out of the wallet ranley uncapped his fountain pen laid the blank sheet on the saddle horn and began to write when he had finished he handed the paper to the artist the latter read aloud mrs manning is the lawful owner of the dolly varden claim turned over to her by joe skeel my deed is a forgery this will be her warrant for having the record cor- rected and my deed set aside wrath blazed in the faces of con- don and the others from ojo caliente valley ranley ought to be lynched declared one and the rest vociferously seconded the opinion you forged that deed yourself didnt you asked wilkinson whats the odds youve got what you want havent you make a clean breast of it in writ- ing the artist went on what we want is the truth if we cant have what we want ranley well turn you over to reeves and youll get what you dont want-and that will be several years in the stone house at yuma ranley took back his written state- rogue or hero  raent added i forged the deed my- self and signed his name wilkinson and all four of the men from the seven stars mine signed their names to the document as witnesses now you can go bill ranley said condon if youre caught in this country after the twenty-four hours arc up well all appear against you for your work here this afternoon dont for- get that its in line with our agree- ment ive had my affairs in shape so i could dig out of buenas noches at a minutes notice returned ranley you fellows arent so blamed smart his spurs clattered and he made off down the swale higgins started to follow wilkin- son leaned down and caught higgins horse by the bits just a minute hig- gins said the artist you cant hold me and let ranley go cried higgins i just want a word with you lis- ten  if any move is made against na- poleon g pendexter well get reeves after you you can be held for this afternoons job all right if you make it necessary tell that to those wrho ought to know now clear out higgins galloped oft when he had vanished from sight condon burst into a gleeful laugh and caught wilkinsons hand thats the slickest job that was ever pulled off in the southwest he de- clared youve done a big thing for mrs manning wilkinson half the plan fell through though said wilkinson i counted on ranley getting peabody to take a hand in the holdup and thats what ranley didnt do thunder why couldnt the whole scheme have worked out without half of it going wrong at the pinch  i think you ought to be satisfied remonstrated the amalgamator have you given up trying to do anything for jim higgins he asked we dont know so much all the time as we do just some of the time an- swered wilkinson cryptically chapter x as if at a vision on don and his companions re- turned to the seven stars mine and wilkinson galloped back to the camp in the arroyo pendexter and sam had returned as wilkinson came within sight of his camp he saw the man from the coast sitting in front of the tent and chatting with miss man- ning sam greatly relieved in mind if his face and manner were any indi- cation of his feelings ran to take the pinto as his employer dismounted where in samhill have you been demanded pendexter of wilkinson been having a picnic was the smil- ing answer thats more than i had in buenas noches said pendexter fretfully ranley didnt keep his appointment i didnt see him at all i rather expected that would be the case wilkinson went on you see ranley couldnt be in two places at the same time mr pendexter about the time he was to meet you ranley and i came together on the trail to the box canon the man of large affairs frowned in his bewilderment you sent me on a wild-goose chase eh he asked sharply not exactly the artists genial smile parried the rising anger of a mag- nate accustomed always to being treated with the utmost consideration one or the other of us was to go on a wild- goose chase and it was about an even break which one it would be heres your wallet mr pendexter i found it mighty useful and that was my rea- son for coaxing it away from you the capitalists face was a study as he took the long pocketbook opened top-notch magazine  it and drew out the paper padding i never was much of a hand for puzzle he remarked ill work this one out for you said wilkinson miss manning im obliged lor the pinto sit down please im going to tell mr pendexter something that will interest you he began at the point where pen- dexter left the arroyo to make his morning- call at the dolly varden claim told of sams finding the wallet and the money and of the stealthy coming of bill ranley while pocketbook and bills were in plain sight on his-wil- kinsons-knees  the greedy expression on ranleys face while he looked at the cash was described along with the plan wilkinson evolved for letting the min- ing sharks greed accomplish his undo- ing  the call at the seven stars camp to get an armed party to watch the trail to the canon keep out of sight and yet be ready for a quick move at the right moment was detailed without mention of any names and then followed the narrative of events in the order of their occurrence climaxed by the writ- ten statement wrung from the baffled ranley the same man can fool me once said wilkinson but if he does it twice its my own fault look at that will you  he offered in evidence the writ- ten statement that was to clear for mrs manning the title to the mining claim pendexter whistled softly as he read the statement and then handed it on to the excited and wondering girl the latter after passing her eyes over the scrawl got up from her chair and took one of wilkinsons hands in both her own so without telling mother or me anything about it she murmured hap- pily you formed this clever plan and carried it out-just for us how can w-e ever thank you mr wilkinson give your thanks to the leader of the men from the seven stars mine miss manning said wilkinson signifi- cantly it was no easy job to watch the trail keep out of sight and then show up promptly right in the nick and pull the business through to a suc- cess pendexter getting out of his chair began walking up and down in front of the tent his head bowed in thought alonzo condon the artist whispered was a regular man at the show-down the girl blushed and then her eyes grew troubled as they swerved to pen- dexter mother and i she said are grateful to you both-more grateful than i know hovyto express pendexter halted in front of wilkin- son youre an artist my boy said he not only in spilling paint on can- vas but in beating a crook at his own game ill be hanged if that work of yours wasnt pretty smooth if you eer get tired painting pictures come around and tell me now who is this alonzo condon that signed the state- ment as a witness again the telltale red leaped into the girls rounded cheeks pendexter flashed a shrewd glance at her and withdrew his eyes to give wilkinson a significant look half humorous half sympathetic condon is an amalgamator in the seven stars mill wilkinson ex- plained  young or old young and as fine a lad as ever hung up a battery of stamps i hope to see him when we go over to ojo caliente valley miss manning in some confusion excused herself and started for the pinto i hope you will call at the adobe mr wilkinson she said as she moved away and give mother a chance to thank you when she had gone pendexter lighted a black cigar to-morrow he announced ill help you get started on the last picture of the set rogue ok hero  this was good news to wilkinson not until he had finished his work would there be any chance of getting pendexter to leave the country so far the activities of reeves and the machi- nations of peabody had not resulted in any harm to the wealthy old man but the danger would remain so long as peabody was at large and pendexter was where the old desert freebooter could get at him it was decided not to move the camp from the arroyo pendexter and wil- kinson would use the car for going and coming between the arroyo and the val- ley the first days work was largely preliminary pendexter reconnoitered in the vicinity of the spot where the rocking stone had been balanced on its granite base and carefully refreshed his memory while wilkinson was making pen- ciled sketches from his companions de- scription a man arrived on the scene from the seven stars mill he brought the very thing-a kodak picture of the mammoth stone taken by one of the mill hands just before the natural curi- osity had been blasted to fragments condon the millman explained had asked him to watch for wilkinson and to get the picture into his hands wheres condon  asked pendex- ter why didnt he bring the picture himself  hes away was the answer help- ing reeves round up peabody and his crowd pendexter after the millman had left expressed his regret at not being able to meet condon id like to make sure he remarked that hes worthy of that little girl at the dolly varden with the photograph to work from wilkinson had no difficulty in getting his picture sketched to pendexters lik- ing day after day the two drove in the flivver to the valley wilkinson painted and pendexter sat in the car and smoked or watched the picture btn taking form under the artists brush or strolled over to the seven stars camp and watched the mining and mill- ing but condon remained away and was not to be seen in five days wilkinsons work was done the six pictures were taken to buenas noches and left with a furni- ture dealer to pack carefully and ship by express to hollywood wilkinson was now ready to say good-by to the deserts to pack his equipment into the tonneau of the car and to hit the long trail for home but pendexter was not ready reeves and his posse were crowding peabody hard but they had not yet been able to round him up and get hands on him jfcist to make the dep- uty sheriff more industrious pendex- ter had offered him another thousand dollars for bringing in the old desert fox while were waiting pendexter suggested to wilkinson i might as well pay a visit to the box canon ive been thinking of that ever since i got here nows my chance the visit was to consume two or three days they were to camp on the flat and pendexter was to survey the old scenes at his leisure he was as happy as a boy over the prospect on their way out they halted at the adobe on the dolly varden claim they found reeves there with a couple of men the party had just ridden up to water their horses from the over- flow at the arrastre well have peabody mr pendex- ter the deputy sheriff declared confi- dently maybe this afternoon or to- morrow or next day were closing in on the old devil and he cant pos- sibly dodge us much longer  ive found out something about him-got it straight as a string years and years ago he used to be around here but he got caught at some of his tricks and was sent over the road ive found 	top-notch just one old prospector who remembers anything about peabody in those early days the prospector is jeff bly he says peabody wasnt the mans name when he used to be cruising around these parts but what he called himself then bly cant remember the ex-con- vict is a desperate case mr pendex- ter and hes made threats against you i think youd better go back to town and wait till we get him corralled go back to town echoed pendex- ter why because answered reeves bluntly youll be a heap safer there than if youre knocking around these hills peabody lays all his recent troubles to you with a record like hes got and all this other stuff on his mind it wont be hard to figure what hell try to do if he finds you within gunshot of him pendexter laughed easily why im an old desert man myself reeves he said and all i want is to come close enough to peabody to give him a good square look thats it a good square look ill consider myself in luck if he crosses trails with me reeves had said enough to make wil- kinson nervous not on his own account but on pendexters he tried to per- suade pendexter to follow the deputy sheriffs advice and put off his visit to the canon until peabody had been captured but pendexter was obdu- rate and resented such advice as an aspersion on his courage theres going to be a storm reeves put in looking at the cloudless sky and sniffing the still air the barometer says our annual rain is about due you wont have a very pleasant time in the canon if the water comes down on you during my ten years in these des- erts returned pendexter i saw only two rains there was a sprinkle for five minutes and not enough water any- where to give a road runner a drink bosh  magazine w hile pendexter was talking with reeves wilkinson went to the adobe and called cherry manning to the door i wish youd get word to condon miss manning he said to come to the vox canon this afternoon the idea seerned to stir the girl strangely why  she asked i wish mr pendexter wouldnt insist on having an interview with him i-i - her voice failed her and the crimson flooded her face  dont want him to come over there to see pendexter but to see me wil- kinson went on its important in that case ill go over to the seven stars mine myself said cherry the artist thanked her turned away and climbed into the car sam was already sprawled on the luggage in the tonneau and pendexter was waiting for wilkinson to take his seat so he could get aboard it was about ten oclock in the forenoon when they left the dolly varden claim and at eleven they were picking their course along the rockv bed of the canon toward hardly able flat pendexter was launched on a flood of reminiscences he was living over the old times with pecos pete mcgaff- ney and every landmark had its own particular story wilkinsons fears of peabody dwindled as he listened and when they reached the flat and pitched camp he was in his normal frame of mind and cheerfully ignoring the dread possibilities the surprise came after dinner while sam was getting the camp work out of the way and wilkinson was listening to pendexter describe the fight with the tar heel gang and the shooting of mcgaffney vanette and his crowd were among the rocks over there pendexter was saying and i was standing about here and pete was where you are throwing a diamond hitch over the pack on the buckskin mule all at once pete jumped clear over the mule and landed rogue or hero  on inc and toppled me over bang went a gun from the bowlders pete staggered and fell in a sprawl under the cottonwood i looked around and saw vanette leaning across the rocks a smoking rifle in his hand he was just where the rocks at the edge of the flat form a sort of notch- pendexter had turned to indicate the exact spot from which vanette had fired at mcgaffney his hand was lifted and his finger was pointing the words faded from his lips but his hand and pointing finger still hung in the air a man was leaning across the top of the bowlders-a man with a lean face wrinkled and leathery and out of which gleamed eyes that smoldered with the fires of hate he held a rifle pendexter drew a quick breath it was as if he gazed at a vision con- jured out of the past he drew in his outstretched hand and passed it across his eyes wilkinson whirled and started at a run for the car to get his revolver another man starting up as if out of the solid earth posted him- self in front of the car and waved the artist back with a rifle off to one side in the vicinity of the tent a yell of warning cut the still hot air like a knife tt was sam his body half crouched his hands half ex- tended awaiting the attack of a third man who was running toward him a trick of jujutsu in the most approved style settled for sams assailant the fellow went down in a huddle before the jap could straighten and whirl around however a fourth man had rushed up behind him and struck him down with a heavy blow straight from the shoulder i reckon youre mine now nap pen- dexter called peabody his voice husky with triumph as he stepped clear of the rocks you ort to have knowed better than to set the law on me and git me all stirred up now youll take whats cornin in that moment a cloud curtain was drawn swiftly across the sun a gust of wind sucked through the canon driving at the tent until every guy rope creaked under the strain overhead loose sand was flying like smoke bil- lows the blast whimpered and whis- tled among the rocks and crags and from a great distance came a mutter- ing ominous of what was to follow peabody continued slowly across the flat his rifle in the hollow of his arm his glittering eyes never once swerv- ing from pendexter for thirty years he went on lift- ing his voice above the clamor of the wind your shadow has been across my path in the old days you was called a man who never failed to run out your trail you hung to a grudge like a hound dawg to a bone you had swore youd git me and i knew it i slid around through the hills like a scairt coyote pickin up a livin as best i could and i was hooked by the law in the mogollons and sent up for raid- in a camp and nigh killin a man who stood between me and the grub i needed and had to have fifteen years i done for that when i come out i reckoned people had forgotten me but not you nap pendexter you dont never for- get i got word from noches you was cornin here and i got here first and laid for you i know what i got to do to save my scalp and you can gam- ble im goin to do it cady vanette exclaimed pendex- ter something told me i had you plumb to rights tar-heel yanette chapter xi while the flood raged there is no more peaceful occupa- tion in the world than that of painting pictures but jack wilkinson in following his chosen career seemed prone to adventure as the sparks fly upward there was his experience with  top notch magazine gar raeburn when at sleepy capis- trano he painted his now famous pic- ture the last requiem it was no fault of raeburns that wilkinsons own requiem had not been chanted that time and there was the trouble in sespe canon out of which came the noble canvas that had thrilled art lovers at many an exhibition again heralded wide and far for its symbolic beauty and sure craftsmans touch was the painting known as the -ast of his race hanging now on the walls of a palace in orange grove avenue pas- adena if that canvas could speak what stories it would tell of the old santa fe trail wilkinsons life had been so crowded with adventures that he had come to expect them and ex- pecting them he was rarely found un- ready at the pinch of a crisis never before however had he tried to weather adverse circumstances with a headstrong multimillionaire he felt his responsibility and was to be par- doned the flash of dismay that darted through him pendexter with only his two hands was confronted by an armed ruffian in a killing mood the link connecting cady vanette with death or life im- prisonment was this financial baron from los angeles and hollywood the logic of vanettes desperation was plain sam hooray was hat on his back and breathing in gasps between wil- kinson and togin santa where were stored all the firearms of the campers stood a wild-eyed man with a gun vanette counting himself had four in his party-ruffians all hard-pushed by the deputy sheriff and reckless and ready for anything sam striking with the edge of his flattened hand and gouging cunningly al certain nerves with his two thumbs had worked havoc with one of vanettes followers before he himself had been struck down there remained three against three in the event that sum recovered quickly and could bear a hand but three with guns could work their will against three without what was to be done wilkinson put the question to his wits and for once his wits had no ready answer then he saw the man bowled over by sam hitching on all fours across the sandy flat mumbling dazedly under his breath it was jim higgins wilkin- son already had changed his views about higgins he was not surprised to see the man there if higgins in his blind progress crawled close enough it might be possible to snatch the weapon that hung in his belt wil- kinson waited and watched only to be disappointed the fellow with the heavy fist who had accounted for sam ran to higgins caught him by the col- lar and dragged him to the base of the cottonwood wilkinson took another look at the man barring the way to the flivver the fellow was on his job and jeered loudly the wind snatched the wide- brimmed hat from the mans head hurled it across the canon and pinned it to the rocks the owner of the hat never even looked around he was there to watch wilkinson and he did it the flat was in two terraces on the riverside the car had been driven to the first terrace some five feet be- low the flats level the width of the terrace however threw the car into plain view of those above vanettes men had climbed to the upper surface where he could better command the sit- uation pendexter and vanette bracing themselves against the growing force of the wind were standing a dozen feet apart silence had fallen upon them twice vanette had half raised his rifle some quirk of the mind had caused him to lower the piece he delayed not because of any compunction rogue or hero  against dropping a helpless man out of hand for such a feeling could not square with his nature he had his enemy where he wanted him and per- haps he took heartless satisfaction in keeping him there for a space wilkinson was touched with admira- tion for napoleon g pendexter at that moment the captain of big affairs wqs game he did not flinch al- though he must have realized fully what vanette was planning for him great wealth no doubt makes many changes in a mans life but they are more often superficial than fundamental at least it was so in pendexters case down at the roots of his soul he was the same man who had faced the tar heel gang on that same flat thirty years before the wind increased in fury the twilight darkness in the canon deepened with the gathering rush of clouds the distant muttering grew louder some- where in the north there had been a cloudburst every lateral defile that opened through the walls of the main canon was delivering a stream into the headwaters of the cattywampus the river was no longer a joke but as yet there was no change in the box canon the pools rippled by the stirring air still were separated by stretches of dry sand rare as it is a storm in the des- ert country is about the quickest thing in nature vanette pendexter shouted to make himself heard over the roar of the wind youre a fool to think you can save yourself by putting me out of the way youve got to pay for what you did to pete mcgaffney i cant pay no more was the an- swer of the enraged vanette if i do to you now what i done to pecos thirty years ago and as i said youve got it cornin with a crash like the explosion of a cannon the guy ropes gave way and the tent was hurled across the flat the man between wilkinson and the auto- mobile was caught and enmeshed in the sailing canvas he was thrown off his feet rolled over and over and finally dropped neck and heels to the first ter- race the tent went booming down the canon while the man picked himself up dazedly and began climbing up to the flat again he had dropped his rifle wilkinson rushed for it picked it up and whirled to command the scene between pendexter and vanette which was fast approaching a climax a report echoed from the north side of the flat the man who had played such havoc with sam had planted him- self firmly with his back to the wind and his gun at his shoulder and was making a target of wilkinson he fired twice one bullet digging into the sand at the artists feet and the other fanning his face as it went on to flatten against the rocks then sam reviving caught the marksman about the knees with both arms and pulled him down vanette with a wild oath jumped for the cover of the rock heaps he was the only one on the flat in a posi- tion to shield himself it looked as if pendexter wilkinson and sam out in the open were to be at vanettes mercy get down to the river bed pendex- ter  yelled wilkinson and had hardly given the warning before he found himself at handgrips with the man whose rifle he had picked up sam was engaging the other man and the two rolled over and over on the ground just at that moment a wall of water charged into the box canon tum- bling and tossing like a tidal wave wilkinsons assailant wrenched away from him look out for the water he bellowed its cornin down on us with that he raced for the canon wall a deafening roar drowned out the words and wilkinson must have been the only one who heard them the alarm was unnecessary every one on  top-notch magazine the hat was aware of the approaching flood vanette startled out of his mur- derous scheme was scrambling toward the foot of an ancient path that scaled the cliff behind the flat wilkinson and sam rushed toward pendexter who a dim figure was beckoning with his hand pendexter followed vanette and wilkinson and sam trailed after pen- dexter they gained the narrow dizzy path and were in safety when the water hurled itself past them at race-horse speed submerging the flat and picking up the automobile like an inconsequen- tial chip and carrying it along a smother of rain dropped from the black clouds overhead it fell like a cur- tain shutting off from wilkinson the sight of his friends and enemies and almost beating him downward into the flood water ran like a stream in the path and wilkinson lay in it and clung to the rocks the deluge lasted for a few minutes only and ceased as suddenly as it had begun mists lifted slowly a few feet above him wilkinson saw pendexter hanging for dear life to a bush that grew out of the rocks directly below wilkinson was sam wedged securely between two bowlders are you all right pendexter  wil- kinson called im all right now was the gur- gling answer but i came within an ace of pitching off into the river in all the time i spent in these deserts i never saw anything like this before i remember this path it widens out just above me and turns around a shoulder of rock and leads to the top of the wall if you and sam are able wed better climb out wilkinson looked upward as he be- gan to climb then what he saw caused him to stop climbing just before the path turned the angle of the cliff it crossed a wide shelf under a high over- hang in this niche stood two horses one a pinto and the other a buckskin and on the pinto-could wilkinson be- lieve his eyes-was cherry manning calm enough although drenched to the skin the girl sat in her saddle her attention was riveted on alonzo con- don who had dismounted and was mov- ing across the shelf toward the point where the path fell steeply down to the flat the amalgamator was crouched forward and his soggy garments tric- kled rills of water as he moved be- tween him and pendexter and facing the man below was cady vanette vanette had lost his rifle but he was drawing a stag-handled dirk from his pocket it was quite evident that he knew nothing of the presence of the girl and condon in the path above him a slow horror gripped wilkinson at no time since he and pendexter and sam had encountered vanette and his men so unexpectedly had grisly trag- edy hastened more surely toward dread results than then he was powerless to help pendexter all he could do was to crouch in the steep slippery path stare upward-and wait chapter xii dame fortunes trump wanette descending toward pen- dexter with a slow catlike step pulled the thin blade out of the sheath pendexter started up the quickness of the movement caused his feet to slip on the dripping stones he went down flat but caught at the bush again and held himself sprawling in the path picking his steps with certainty and swiftness yanette came on he was obsessed with fears with the thought of vengeance long deferred the shadow of an evil past was over him urging him on to deeds more evil he came to pendexter and was bend- ing down when condon caught him from behind had condon delayed an- other moment it would have been too rogue or hero  late a breath of relief escaped wil- kinson one event had followed another so rapidly that the artist had had no time to wonder at finding the girl and the amalgamator with their horses half- way up the canon wall he had sent for condon the girl had come with him and it was a fortunate circum- stance that the two were there pendexter lifted himself to his knees as vanette faced about and began a struggle with the amalgamator cherry manning her face white and her eyes filled with anxiety leaned forward across her saddle horn and looked down not a detail- of the fight in the narrow path drenched and treacherous as it was escaped her vanette had a knife condon had only his bare hands but vanette was old and condon was young as the two swayed back and forth the amal- gamator gripping the wrist of the hand that clutched the knife vanette must have realized how unequal were his powers in such a struggle some wild thought struck at his mind and a fun of purpose showed in the twisting lines of his face he dropped the knife and clasped both arms rigidly around con- dons neck over condons shoulder he could see pendexter-meet his glance fairly for a moment one way i can git you nap pen- dexter if t cant another he rasped then deliberately he heaved both him- self and condon sidewise out of the steep path hanging to condons head and shoulders and dragging him into the boiling waters that filled the canon a groan wrenched pendexters lips and he dropped his face in his hands sam lifting himself out from between the two bowlders in which he had wedged himself called to wilkinson and held up a coil of rope where sam had picked up that reata or what mo- tive had swayed him when he did so v ii kin son did not know the tap was preparing for a quick cast when a pinto horse with a girl rider pitched off the shelf above for pure daring wil- kinson had never seen anything to equal that jump the pinto hit the water with a resounding splash cherry manning was curtained from sight for a moment by upfiung waves and a mist of flying spume then when she and the pinto reappeared they were whirl- ing down the canon fighting their way closer and closer to the two forms that battled amid the churning eddies thus the girl and the pinto and condon and vanette were hurled onward to- ward the old placerings and lost to sight of those in the path pendexter had lifted his face to watch then when he could no longer see he had risen to his feet and thrown up his hands his eyes were dull his face of an ashen color and he was shaking like a man with the ague theyre-theyre done for he whispered wilkinson nothing on earth can save them he seemed very old then he put out a hand to catch wilkinsons arm and steady himself pendexter had come to a point in his career where his strong spirit faltered and was near fail- ing him dont be so sure about their being done for pendexter returned wilkin- son the boy was fighting for me pen- dexter quavered and vanette pulled him down deliberately and with the intention of sacrificing himself if only he could take the boy with him that was alonzo condon the young fellow i have been telling you about and the girl murmured pendex- ter it was a deliberate sacrifice on her part too weve got to get out of this said wilkinson this narrow trail you say leads to the top of the canon wall brace up pendexter and well climb out   top-notch magazine pendexter could do little to help him- self wilkinson and sam between them got him to the shelf under the overhang then they turned the buck- skin horse got pendexter to the ani- mals back and went on slowly and carefully up the treacherous slope the path broadened beyond the turn so that sam could walk beside the buckskin and hold the drooping form of the los angeles man in the saddle in due course they got out of the canon by the same way condon and cherry manning had ridden down into it and there they met reeves dis- mounted and holding his horse at the cliffs edge a yell of satisfaction broke from the deputy sheriff by gorry here you are i didnt reckon id ever seen you again i warned you to keep out of the canon and- whats the matter with pen- dexter he asked of wilkinson star- ing at the drenched and disconsolate figure on the buckskin horse wilkinson started to tell him what had happened never mind that reeves cut in i saw most of it from up here-con- dons plunge into the water with pea- body and the girls dive after them on the pinto but pendexter neednt feel so broken up the girl made a land- ing with condon on the old gravel bench and my men fished out two of peabodys gang with their ropes i dont know what became of peabody but i guess that wont worry us he is- pendexter hung up his head you say the girl and condon arc safe he demanded come this way and tll show you said reeves he led them along the brink to a point not far from the caves of the river the wall was notched out above the caves and in the bottom of the notch stood three of reeves men watching the flood recede and keeping guard of the two who had been va- nettes aids during the recent troubles on the flat there was the man who had stood between wilkinson and the car and the other man who had struck sam down from behind the flivver a sorry wreck was hanging on the spur of granite that concealed the secret en- trance to the caves a wail went up from sam and he beat the air mournfully with his hands ai ai togin sania gone up the flume mr wilk honorable car all busted in pieces no more will togin santa carry you to painting scenes in california beauty spots beautiful ma- chinery all smashed by pig of a river ai ai sam almost wept painting material also gone  camp gone won- derful gasoline stove where is it this joke river has completed wholesale de- struction  he shook his fist at the river and said savage things to it in his native tongue below on the old gravel bench far up toward the side of the canon and well out of the flood could be seen the girl and condon and the pinto horse pendexter knelt and looked over the brink of the wall he stretched out his hands and happiness flooded his face hugh  he called hugh and alonzo condon waved his hand his right hand for his left hand and arm were around the waist of the girl both looked upward dad condon called back although a hundred feet of sheer wall separated those on the bench from those on the cliffs brink reconcilia- tion bridged the space destiny through the long years had worked un- erringly toward that scene in the box canon and fortune prodigal of the fa- vors she had showered upon napoleon g pendexter-had led him into perils merely that she might play for him her trump card rogue or hero  after some time wilkinson and pen- dexter reached the spot where the others were gathered the receding flood left the crumpled and lifeless forms of cady vanette and jim hig- gins far down the canon caught almost within arms length of each other by the same bowlder heap there was a significance in this for eart holloway one of vanettes men asserted that jim higgins was vanettes son james higgins vanette young vanette as he lay with the hair washed back from his brow up- turned a face that was almost smiling bart holloway explained further jim was with me and hed a been all right if hed stayed where he was but no when cady come down- stream fightin with condon and when the girl drove along on that pinto cayuse and grabbed condon by the arm cady was in a hard row o stumps jim went after him and cady grabbed the boy and they both went down thats the how of it he worked at the seven stars mill for a while said condon but he was discharged after that he got to trail- ing around with bill ranley from the crumpled water-soaked and sand-stained brown corduroy clothes wilkinson gently removed a gold watch with a cheap leather chain strangely enough that watch had not been lost out of the pocket that held it this is yours he asked handing the timepiece to condon the amalgamator nodded i missed it while jim higgins was on the night shift with me in the mill he said re- luctantly this watch caused you to make a wrong guess wilkinson he added a little study of the sketch of cady vanette caused me to revise that opin- ion i had another guess then and it was closer to the mark there was nothing in the face of jim higgins to remind me of napoleon g pendexter but there was in yours condon- where did you get that my mothers name said hugh dad-and he was quite right about it -had forbidden me to use the name of pendexter until i had shown myself fit- lets forget that boy cut in pen- dexter the amalgamator smiled willingly dad he answered alonzo was my middle name so as alonzo condon i was a stranger to those who had known me as hugh pendexter ive made many mistakes- weve all made mistakes pendex- ter interrupted he put out his hand and rested it on the shoulder of cherry manning one of my worst mistakes would never have been made had i known this brave and charming girl as i know her now he put his heart into the words when i saw the name alonzo condon signed as witness to that statement of ranleys he con- tinued and when i heard it from wilkinson and-others he smiled at cherry-i began to get my eyes opened i sent word to condon by miss manning spoke up wilkinson when you insisted on coming to the box canon in the face of reeves warning i wanted him around he had shown so much anxiety about you mr pendex- ter that i had pretty nearly figrred out the mystery i felt that condon would want to be on hand if you were in danger cherry brought the word hugh put in and insisted on coming with me we looked down from the rim of the canon while yanette and his crowd were making trouble and i started down the old goat path i hadnt an idea cherry was following the girl smiled at him arent you glad i did lon she asked  top-notch magazine chapter xiii receipting a bill ox the day following in the del- niontco hotel in buenas noches pendexter transacted a little business with jack wilkinson sitting at a table in the office the man of large affairs requested the artist to make out his bill it took wilkmson about two minutes napoleon g pendexter esquire to jack wilkinson dr to six desert landscapes as per agreement  each  pendexter looked at the bill then picked up a pen and did some writing on the document that looks better to me he said returning the paper how does it look to you wilkinsons eyes widened as he read to six landscapes as per agreement  each  to one flivver wrecked in the flood  to painting equipment do  to sundry experiences not in contract   kindly receipt that my boy said pendexter look here said wilkinson what are you trying to put over  me i dont know whether to feel like a rogue or a hero money cant pay you for what you went through with me on hardly able flat insisted pendexter i claim the right to make up to you in so far as possible for the danger and inconveni- ence into which i dragged you in the canon but if you deny me that right i shall fall back on our verbal under- standing in los angeles of paying a bonus over and above the price agreed on for the pictures your pictures have pleased me very much wilkinson i selected just the right man for that job thats all right wilkinson re- turned and j appreciate the feeling that prompts your generosity but i cant take pay on account of troubles we got into with cady vanette tf you were pleased with my work you ere to double the payment for the pictures he laughed you can go that far mr pendexter and right there i draw the line he amended the last item on the bill to read  to bonus as per verbal agreement  its all right to pay for the car and equipment he went on although you flatter l ogin sama and the stuff on the flat and in the tonneau but never mind ill remember sam out of the proceeds and maybe it will comfort him on account of losing the car ive already remembered sam said pendexter you didnt think for a minute id forget him did you and right at that moment sam came into the hotel office after an extended tour of the buenas noches clothing emporiums and haberdashers shops his wardrobe had suffered in the flood but he was now dressed in the extreme of the prevailing mode mr wilk said he observe what illustrious gentleman has done to me i have great passion for fine garments which inspire noble thoughts in wearers of same friends in los angeles will be cheered to learn of my ample for- tune theres a check for seven thousand dollars wilkinson remarked pendex- ter after scribbling in his check book and tearing out an oblong slip but im accustomed to having mv way and youll get the rest of it watch me he reached for a pad of telegraph blanks and wrote out two messages one he showed to wilkinson and the other he folded and pushed into his pocket the telegram wilkinson read was to mrs peadexter have found hugh mother he is a man grown and has proved it theres going to be a wedding and it cant go on without you catch first rn fr buenas noches wilkinson was pleased this is fine he exclaimed rogue or hero  youre going to stay for the do- ings wilkinson pendexter declared hugh and cherry insist on it so do i well have a few days in buenas noches before the big event and im going to start improvements at the dolly yarden a lawyer is busy now with that statement of ranleys ill stay of course said wilkin- son of course you will and while youre here youll paint a picture of cherry manning-of cherry on that pinto cay use ill give you a thousand for that gad but theres a girl look- here she comes with hugh the ex-amalgamator and the little lady from the hills entered the hotel at that moment cherry went at once to pendexter and took him by both hands her face was glowing with happiness youve come to know hugh as i know him havent you she asked i reckon thats the right way to put it but what has straightened out my differences with hugh is my coming to know cherry manning as he knows her pendexter drew a long breath what a fool an old money grubber can make of himself-sometimes he added regretfully son and he turned to hugh dutchmans hill ojo caliente valley the dolly varden claim and the cattywampus country are really inspiring after all eh for real inspiration dad said hugh with a quiet smile the dolly varden claim is worth all the rest of that scenery i dont know but youre right agreed pendexter chuckling mrs pendexter arrived next morn- ing and a happier woman wilkinson never saw what she had longed for had come to pass hugh had proved his worth and he and his father were again the chums they had been before domestic ties had been broken in los angeles mrs pendexter loved cherry from the start and was taken out to the dolly varden claim to get ac- quainted with cherrys mother napo- leon g and hugh went along leaving wilkinson and sam hooray in town in the afternoon wilkinson got a message from home have sold sea mists to art connoisseur named jor- dan for three thousand dollars come home and lets celebrate this was signed by mrs jack wilkinson wilkinson tumbled into a chair can you beat it he said to sam hooray that little girl at home has sold a picture i held at five hundred dollars for three thousand banzai cried sam mrs wilk is wonderful saleslady allow me to felicitate please she sold it to a man named jor-  dan wilkinson went on what difference so long as most excellent picture is disposed of well napoleon g pendexters law- yer is a man named jordan ah ha sam grinned delightedly so you receive what you would not take in spite of all by instrumentality of mrs wilk a most clever idea of illustrious pendexter i would call such proceeding in business parlance re- ceipted in full i suppose so sam its no use hang- ing out i can see that he wont rest until i accept the money well if he insists on paying that much for the picture my conscience is clear pleased to observe change of heart in honorable wilk wonderful talents for painting like yours will be recog- nized with great wealth in spite of per- sonal modesty all this makes me very- jolly boy mr wilk youre a jollier all right sam said wilkinson lets stroll around to the telegraph office pendexter told me to send mrs wilkinson a wire inviting her to the wedding well do our cel- ebrating in buenas noches pleased to do said sam happy times is good for celebrating chapter i somewhat over co n fden t hat last page of his fathers letter vexed fred creighton he was inclined to take it resentfully a fellows got to filter in a little recreation along with his studies he brooded again he picked up the closing page of the unusually long missive and read now for a final word fred dont think im scolding you i merely want to give you a word of advice the tone of your last letter leads me to believe that you are altogether too sure of yourself change your attitude son theres nothing on earth so had for an athlete as a swelled head that malady has lost more races than id care to count i want to have  win but  want you to go about it in the right spirit ou say youre absolutely sure of winning your event this spring how can you be isnt it conceivable that tartown is not boasting of her runners prowess ibis early in the season you can never tell what you are going to run up against until you oe the mark in the crucial race but enough of this just follow the lead and dont bank on seeming certainties about your request for an increase in your allow- ance i dont like it fred i dont grudge you the money but candidly i think youre having enough as it stands ur allow- ance i bigger than mine ever was i hope you are not doing excessive night running nothing will so quickly waste health and money but ill scold no more write soon fred and reassure me affectionately your father james b creighton p s-i inclose chcck as per your request fred folded the sheet and placed it with the rest of the letter in the drawer of his study table he was in argu- mentative mood if he calls going to a dance now and then night running he muttered sourly then i suppose im dissipating but theres nothing else to do in the evening-especially when  there arc  lesson assignments and the money- if some of the fellows would only return promptly what they borrow i wouldnt have to call on him for more he drew from his waistcoat pockct a fountain pen and uncapped it a search through the litter of books and papers on the table brought to light a little-used writing tablet he doesnt understand how it is fred ruminated the pen held loosely between his lips why tartown has absolutely  one who is worth beans in the furlong itll be a dead walk- away if dad were here and knew conditions as i do hed soon see the needlessness of worrying he added knowingly w ell here goes anyway too jure complete in this issue too sure ill have this letter off my mind to- night it took the young junior the better part of an hour to put his reply on paper but finally he had it done to his own satisfaction but it is very doubt- ful that had he been in his fathers shoes he would have interpreted much reassurance from the letter last year in a very close race fred creighton had won the two-hundred- and-tvventy-yard dash from a speedy tartown man but the latter had been graduated in the summer this per- haps was the clew to freds feeling of confidence the big dual meet was a month away still anyway he reflected and there remained plenty of time for hard work if unexpected talent should show up on the rival colleges team creighton was in the act of sealing his letter when a shrill whistle sounded below his window he jumped up from his chair and raised the sash that you will he called then receiving an affirmative answer be down in a minute he closed the window and settled his coat snugly to his broad shoulders be- fore his dresser mirror he gave a finish- ing touch to his hair with the silver- backed military brushes fussed with his tie and picking a checkered cap from his collection of headgear switched the light off and ran down the stairs will mallory was eagerly awaiting his appearance at the foot of the front steps we havent got much time fred he cautioned the train leaves in five minutes inasmuch as the station was only a couple of blocks distant they arrived in time will mallory might almost have been called a dandy he was tond of the latest in clothes and usually wore it always short of money he had cultivated fred creighton for that young man had never yet refused to tide him over the big-chested gray-eyed junior liked mallory in a way he knew that his money was what the other liked most about him but that worried him little for mallory knew more girls than any one else in scott college it was through him that creighton had be- come acquainted with eva stone she would be at the dance to-night that was the main reason creighton was going miss stone attended tartown college-the rival institution-and creighton had found her to be the most delightful of companions she was small in stature had adorable blue eyes and sunny brown hair and a smile that was worth going miles to bask in at half past eight they reached tar- town and fifteen minutes later they mounted the wide stairs of odd fel- lows hall creighton found miss stone in rare good spirits that evening and had several dances with her it was while negotiating the steps of the latest novelty to reach tartown that he chanced to look over her shoulder to- ward the door to an anteroom two persons in the doorways were evidently much interested in himself one was considerably older than the other had a brown mustache and a puffy face he wras looking intently in the direction the younger mans finger pointed-and that w-as directly at fred creighton but the hand was quickly low ered when they noticed that creigh- ton was observing them and they turned about nonchalantly andstrolled out into the smaller room the action of the strangers puzzled creighton and though his glimpse of them had been only momentary he could not banish them from his thoughts during the remainder of the evening he did not see them again in the hall even though he took the trouble in the interval between dances to saunter to the room he had seen them enter now be sure you dont forget fri-  top-notch magazine day night two weeks from to-night miss stone cautioned him as he and will mallory seized their hats prepara- tory to making a dash for the last train to scott itll be a much better dance than to-nights youll come sure its pretty close to the date of the meet creighton said but shucks ive nothing to fear yes ill come eva when after one in the morning creighton entered his room and switched on the light his eyes fell on an envelope on the table pshaw he muttered did i for- get to mail my letter to dad he picked it up and weighed it un- decidedly in his hand then putting on his cap he ran to the corner and dropped it into the mail box chapter ii news and a present vi ore than once in the days that followed creighton found his mind dwelling on the pair of strangers he had observed at the tartown dance why had they looked upon him with so much apparent interest who were they the younger of the two had appeared to creighton in the brief in- stant he had seen him to be a decent- enough-looldng chap but the older man had not made a favorable impres- sion on the scott college junior creighton determined if he should see either of them on his next visit to tartown that he would find out who they were he realized when he came to give it sober thought that he had no right to promise miss stone that lie would come to the dance-only two weeks ahead of the big meet that was the time when he should be train- ing hardest and staying in nights but he had promised on the spur of the moment so what was there to do about it saturday afternoon eight days after his evening journey to tartown with will mallory he picked up the grip containing his track togs and set out for the athletic field he changed his clothes in the dressing room under the grand stand and coming out vaulted the low fence separating the track and the bleachers and jogged once around the oval the scott college cinder path was not a quarter-mile one for the simple reason that the plot was not large enough to accommodate an oval of that length without pinching the width of the track every available foot of land had been used the total circumfer- ence was exactly three hundred and seventeen yards this explained the presence of so many whitewashed posts at various points along the inner edge of the track they were the carefully reckoned start- ing points of the several running events todd the trainer was on hand that saturday afternoon and directing creighton to go to the starting line for the two-twenty-yard dash he took his position at the finish and clocked the junior for a trial furlong as creigh- ton pulled up after crossing the line he joined todd from the expression on the trainers face he deduced that his time had not been very satisfactory too slow he asked slow  sneered tod why you couldnt keep up with a tow mule at that rate youre very bad whats the matter with you anyway  this was todds usual manner so it disturbed creightons equanimity but little its quite a while before the meet still he returned light-heartedly lots of time yet lots of time nothing said the trainer heatedly youre plumb out of condition and wont be worth a whoop unless you get down to hard work ive been watching you a good bit lately and it seems to me you dont much care whether you train regularly too sure  or nol now youve got to cut the foolishness and get in and dig you want to make the team dont you  this was going a little far even for todd thought creighton but even though the trainers words stung he wisely controlled his temper but be could not resist one attempt at argu- ment theres no one at tartown can beat me he said voicing his fa- vorite theme i dont see why i have to work my head off when i can win without training at all say young fellow retorted the trainer hotly you want to can that notion and mighty pronto if i hear much more of that brand of wisdom i wont enter you thats final todd turned away creighton after a few minutes more of desultory trotting around the oval returned to the dressing room soon he emerged in his street clothes his cheeks burned as he walked briskly back to the boarding house great scott but todd was in a huff he mumbled pugnaciously as he strode along but i guess he doesnt know everything and he talks about keeping me off the team id like to see him do it why the student body wouldnt stand for it a minute well one thing is certain im going to that dance next friday in spite of anything if todd had been a little more decent  might have explained things to eva and broken the date with her but i wont now i he added vehemently not for anything creighton was thoroughly angry and it would take some tall and tactful per- suasion to show him that he was in the wrong when creighton reached his room he found will mallory lounging comfort- ably in his own favorite chair will was not an athlete and never wished to be one he loved too well to be master of his own time whats the matter fred  he in- quired noting that the junior was not in his usual spirits todd get your goat never mind todd was creightons reply hes a mutt i know it chimed in mallory you fellows are fools to let him domi- neer you but say have you heard the news  what news tartowns got a new trainer names clemens hes from the state university what of it said fred he was in no mood for conversation oh nothing replied the other re- alizing for a wonder that his presence was boring the ill-tempered junior guess ill have to be going but i almost forgot it i called in at the post office and brought your mail along a parcel and a letter and say fred who is corresponding with you from tartown well so long he handed over the mail and departed creightons feelings softened some- what when his eyes scanned the girlish handwriting on the expensive envelope theres only one girl in tartown who knows me well enough to write to me he thought and thats eva stone he opened the envelope carefully and read the brief penned note it contained it was from miss stone all right but it merely told him that the tartown dance had been postponed one week and would he be sure to come r creighton wrote a warmly affirma- tive reply and went to the corner and mailed it before he thought again of the parcel mallory had brought from the post office when he returned to his room he gave it his first attention the superscription immediately made him cognizant of the fact that it was from his father then he recollected birthday present i suppose he told himself im twenty-two to-morrow takes the folks to remind a fellow of his age  top-notch magazne it was a small square package and had come by parcel post insured it did not take him long to unwrap it and lift the cover of the box inside good for you dad he exclaimed as he lifted out the contents ive wanted one for a long time it was an expensive gold stop watch to the ring was attached by a piece of colored twine a small card the brief line of writing on it caused creighton to ponder keep an eye on your time boy it read chapter iii an anonymous message preighton spent half of sunday in a sulk but toward evening he became more like his usual self and decided to go for a walk his feet carried him toward the public library and noting that it was an hour before closing time he entered the reading room having nothing better to do he chanced to pick up a current copy of the news tartowns modest eight- page daily in glancing through its col- umns his eyes came to rest  a small item having to do with athletics he dropped into a chair and read it with mild interest tartown college the paragraph recorded has been fortunate enough to secure the services of dalton clem- ens a brother of craig j clemens pro- prietor of the pool room and bowling alley of this town mr clemens has just been graduated from the state uni- versity where he enjoyed an enviable reputation as a sprinter though he has been in town for the last fortnight his advent here has been kept quiet up to now he is said to be as good a coach ns he is a runner and he has undertaken to train our home team for the big meet at the scott college ath- letic grounds two weeks hcnce it is confidently expected that he will de- velop a winning team and that he will bring to light unlooked-for talent in the sprints consequently tartowns hopes for a decisive victory are high humph derided creighton toss- ing the paper aside it takes more than a trainer to manufacture a win- ning team he has to have the right timber to work with and the material at tartowns on the blink this year happening to glance toward one of the reading tables in a farther corner creightons eyes encountered the al- ways recognizable figure of mat mur- phy captain of his own track team creighton got up and joined the other see that item in the tartown sheet mat  he said yes i saw it what do you think about it thats hard to say fred but tve heard that clemens is a crack-a bear for discovering new talent but theres nothing to discover at tartown remonstrated creighton the place has gone sound to sleep i dont believe that theyll take a quar- ter of the points in the meet i wish i were as confident as you said the captain have you any defi- nite reasons for your opinion im only figuring from the showing they made last spring stated the san- guine junior theyve lost all their best men by graduation and a fresh- man never amounts to much dont you believe that answered murphy theres been more than one world record shattered by a freshman i think youre taking too much for granted old man and thats the worst thing you could possibly do as for myself i look for victoryof course but a mighty close run for it-and noth- ing doing at all unless every man of us is right on the crest of good con- dition and to be fit weve all got to work like trench diggers creighton kept silence his opinion was directly contrary to his captains but for once lie was weary of arguing too sure  the matter why every one he talked to seemed to be afraid-even his father but he could make none of them adopt his viewpoint so- going soon mat  he finally asked right away if you want to re- plied the captain rising from his chair and picking up his cap lets go past the station and see the six oclock pull out surely agreed fred creighton and they sought the street and it was at the scott railroad sta- tion that creighton had his second view of the person that had occupied his thoughts considerably for the last few days just before the train pulled out a man with a puffy face and a brown mustache suddenly appeared and rushed up to the ticket window hi ticket purchased he made a bee line for the train fred clutched his friends arm mat do you know who that is he asked excitedly pointing to the figure which was mounting the car platform i didnt see his face replied the captain but from his back id say it was-but there-hes inside the car now at the third window yes its he all right but who queried creighton why clemens of course clemens not the new trainer no no his brother the pool-room man-a regular sport so they say bets on all the athletic contests he paused and surveyed the junior who was fol- lowing with his eyes the train as it steamed out why were you so in- terested in him creighton told murphy of the mans actions at the dance at tartown but the captain at once explained the matter away lightly probably he merely wanted to know who you were he suggested but why did he sneak the minute i spotted him questioned the junior b tn and why should he have wanted to know who i am i wouldnt worry over it advised murphy its too trivial you need your rest at night and if i were you i	wouldnt go to any more dances until the seasons over why not creighton was on the point of demanding but he curbed him- self and instead replied meekly thais so creighton and murphy parted in a few minutes the former setting out for home and supper so that was clemens eh the junior pondered well any one that looks at me the way he did at the dance isnt doing it for fun i wonder what hes been about in scott to-day when he reached the boarding house he found out-or thought he did at any rate a man was here with a message for you mr creighton the landlady an- nounced as he started up the stairs to his room a message for me did he leave it  yes she handed him a soiled en- velope addressed to himself on a type- writer what sort of a looking man was he he inquired before opening the message did he give you his name he didnt mention his name she informed him just gave me that en- velope and asked me to hand it to you he was a rather large man and had a mustache a brown mustache fred asked sort of a fleshy face-a derby hat and a gray suit yes thats him to a t suppers almost ready she added excusing herself in his room

undisturbed that the note had been delivered by the pool-room clemens he had not the slightest doubt but what did the message refer to  and what was the motive behind its delivery to himself it was a teasing problem and by bedtime he was no nearer its solution than he had been before supper it must be some game he is up to creighton thought as he got ready for bed and the only way i see to find out is to get up at the unearthly hour of five and pike down to the track it cant be a practical joker he questioned on second thought no it cant be and ill warrant that clemens being at the tartown dance and having me pointed out has something to do with this affair he wound his new watch and the alarm clock setting the latters alarm for four-thirty switched off the light and tried to go to sleep but it was a hard task when he finally did succeed it was only for a restless slumber ac- companied by many awakenings after what seemed to he several weeks and just as he was beginning to get a little rest the alarm sounded i le ruefully jumped from bed and got into his clothes in the half light of early dawn if i wasnt so keen after a little information youd never see me dress- ing at this

terminated at the college grounds the fresh early-morning smell of growing things was nectar to his lungs as he breathed deeply of the fragrant air he crossed the campus still damp with dew by a

ar- ranged that he didnt care to risk tear- ing his clothes in climbing it he stood where he was a moment and brushing the leaves out of his way peered in his eyes sweeping the ath- letic field from one end to the other but his gaze encountered nothing out of the ordinary shucks he exclaimed disap- pointed i expected to find some- thing doing dollars to doughnuts its a practical joke too sure

absolute limit and on a straightaway course at that but here he had witnessed with his own eyes an eighteen-and-two-fifth seconds fur- long he realized that he would stand no show at all against such a runner but it was also brought home to him that he had not been doing his best this season and he resolved that from now on he would set the pace for strictly living up to training rules he retired

his way to the bremen hotel and there established himself in less than two hours it be- came known throughout scott that any loo-e change any one might wish to stake on scott colleges chance of vic- tory in the coming meet with tartown would be cheerfully covered by mr tapwell-the name the newcomer had registered under it was will mallory who brought this information to creighton in the latters room that evening can you pare me twenty fred he asked as <oon as he had delivered himself of the news. “T could let you have it, Will-yes -” Creighton hesitated. "But if you are thinking of placing it with your Mr. Tapwell, I’m afraid I'll have to refuse you.” "Why so?” questioned the disap- pointed Mallory. "Are you so set against betting?” "I never did approve of gambling.’” stated the junior, “and I don’t intend to lend my money to be used for that purpose. If I were a betting man. I’d hesitate a long time before taking this chap up, anyway.” “But it’s easy money, Fred. He seems more eager to cover bets on the two-twenty than on the whole field day, though he refuses neither. And with you in it-well, it’s a cinch! And I’d like some of the pickings.” Fred began to realize that perhaps he had done an unwise thing in re- maining silent about the early-morning seances at the track. Tt might mean the loss of considerable money to the sportier, patriotic Scottites. “Don’t you believe it’s a cinch, Mal- lory,” he said earnestly. "You see all the fellows and spread the news that there’s a hen on. Tell them to hang onto their money, and that I say so.” “But-” protested the open- mouthed Mallory. "But-” “Do as I say,” urged Creighton. “You’ll wish you had afterward.” Mallory attempted to question his friend, but Fred was not inclined to talk. "If you are fool enough to bet your money after what I’ve told you, you deserve to lose it,” he said with finality. The nonplused Mallory de- cided to beat a hasty retreat. “I believe I’ll have to take Todd into my confidence,” Creighton mused, when the other had gone. "But I hate to admit to him that what I’ve seen morn- ings is all that has spurred me on to earnest work on the track. Still, I’d hate to see the fellows pass over a lot of money to that sure-thing worker.” Fred was morally certain that the newcomer was thoroughly aware of the ability of that marvelous runner he had himself watched for the last three mornings. Though averse to betting, he felt that, if some way to turn the tables on this sure-thing man could be devised, he could at least watch pro- ceedings without much compunction. “But there is no way that I can see,” he reasoned, "unless the phenom could be kept out of the race. But if he’s an amateur I should strenuously object to anything like that. No, there's no way out of it. That chap’s slated to win, and he’d have to be considerably out of form to lose-which isn’t saying that T won't do my best.” After all. he concluded, if folks were going to bet, that was their lookout. Before he went to bed Will Mallory returned. "Well, Bill, what’s this mean? Have you been the rounds* al- ready?” Creighton asked. “Plenty far, Fred,” replied Mallory*, his tone a little odd. "But I was too TOO SURE 55 late. That Tapwell has covered three thousand dollars on the two-twenty alone.” CHAPTER VII. A CANCELED ENGAGEMENT. HTHREE thousand dollars! Mallory's announcement almost struck Creighton dumb. “The boobs! The half-wits!" was all he could say “But that isn’t all, Fred,” his friend went on. “You have got yourself into hot water by sending me out with your warning.” “Hot water! What are you driving at?” “The fellows think it looks queer- your advising them not to bet on you after they’ve already placed their money. They talk as if they think you're double-crossing them.” “What!” Fred fairly shouted his amazement. “They think I’m going to throw the race? Is that what you mean?” he angrily demanded. “That's the way their talk sounds,” Will admitted. “But don’t think that I believe it.” Creighton became thoughtful. He brooded silently over the whole affair, and came to the conclusion that perhaps there was some ground for such an opinion. It might naturally impress one who didn’t know the inside facts that his action was queer-especially after his having repeatedly contended that he would win in a walkaway. “But they ought to know better,” he remonstrated aloud. “How was I to know they had put up their money? And if it were so that I intended to throw the race, do they think I would have come out in the open and warned them ?” Though he sympathized with the jun- ior, Mallory could offer little solace, so a few minutes later he left Creighton alone. "I should have gone to Todd the min- ute I learned what was going on at the track,” the sprinter chided himself. “But how was I to foresee that this was to be the outcome ? And now, when I do lose-as I'm certainly bound to, barring a miracle-what will the fellows think of me? Explanations afterward will sound hollow. I’ve got to confide in Todd to-morrow-before it’s too late.” The prowess of that mysterious early-morning runner had so dominated Creighton’s thoughts that he had for- gotten his promise to Miss Stone. This Wednesday night recollection of his promise to attend the dance at Tar- town Friday evening came to him. “But I can’t do it,” he decided in- stantly. “I hate to disappoint Eva, but I can't break my training at this crucial time-even for her. I’ll write a letter now. She’ll understand how it is.” He searched for writing materials, and soon was at work on the missive. He walked to the corner and mailed the letter, then returned to his room and prepared for bed. Next morning he went as usual to the track, and for the fourth time clocked each of the runners. The phenomenon was not at his best this time, but nine- teen seconds flat was remarkable enough, Creighton thought. At classes that forenoon Fred was aware that he was being regarded by fellow students in an altogether un- usual manner. Most of them seemed to want to hold themselves aloof, but one of them went so far as to remark threateningly: “If you don’t win, Creighton, you’ll regret it as long as you live.” Creighton was sick at heart when he returned to the boarding house for lunch. He had not yet seen Todd, but was determined to see him that after- noon. He was certain the trainer was the proper person to confide in. A let- ter awaited the junior on the hall stand. It was from Miss Stone-a mere note. “Don’t come to Tartown Friday,” it 56 TOP-NOTCH MAGAZINE read. “I never would have invited you if I had known. I will explain every- thing when I see you. Please heed this tor your own sake.” "Well, that makes it certain that Eva won't be mad at me for not coming.’’ Creighton reflected. “But I wonder what could have- made her write like that?" He was not given much time for re- flection, however, for half the noon hour was gone already. He ate a light lunch and returned to the campus. That afternoon, after classes, he walked down to the cinder path, his track suit in the light valise he carried. He cpotted the trainer over by the jumping pit, and immediately started toward him. Before he could speak, however, Todd accosted him. "I want to see you, Creighton,” were his words, and the manner in which they were spoken caused the junior some uneasiness. The veteran coach led the way to a bench at the other end of the field. "I want to know what’s what,” he said, coming to the point immediately. "There's some talk floating about the campus that doesn’t make a hit with me. No doubt you know to what I refer?” Creighton nodded, but didn’t speak. "I thought, the last few days, you had taken in the slack, and were getting your nose down at last. It encouraged me. Now they tell me you don’t in- tend to win your race. How about it?” "I never told anybody I didn’t intend to run for all 1 am worth,” contended Creighton. "But, Todd, I can’t win.” "What! You can’t win? What do you mean by that?” "I can’t win. That’s all there is to it. I’ll try, but I can’t make it.” "That's almost as bad a malady as overconfidence,” stated the trainer. "Might 1 ask the reason for your sud- denly reversed viewpoint?” "If you’ll meet me near the gymna- sium a little before five to-morrow morning,” Creighton proposed, "you’ll see the reason quick enough.” "The gymnasium? At five in the morning? Have you gone nuts?” "Not a bit of it. But if you’ll be there you'll see something that’ll make your mouth drop.” The trainer was genuinely interested now. Perhaps there was some method in Creighton's madness. "I’ll be there,” he said. "Get into your togs and go through the regular stunt.” Five o'clock Friday morning found Creighton and Todd sharing the little space among the trees that lined the west side of the oval. In silence the two watched the performance with which Fred was only too familiar. Each of their watches recorded the flight of the first man-the one wearing the black Tartown upper. Twenty-two and a fifth seconds was the time both chronometers caught. Todd looked curiously into Creigh- ton’s face. “Is this all that’s been bothering you?” he inquired, the trace of a smile on his lips. “Just wait a few minutes,” Fred re- plied. At half past five the second dark horse and his companion appeared. Todd evidently recognized the puffy- faced individual, for he muttered under his breath : "The nerve of him, using our track without permission!" Creighton wondered why he had not commented similarly on the first pair, but Todd vouchsafed no information. The athlete who was a phenomenon in Creighton’s eyes .crossed the field, and the two onlookers prepared to time him. The man across from them clapped his hands, and the trial was on. Todd gave a smothered exclamation as the runner rounded the turn, and glanced sharply at the face of his watch. For an instant an expression of amaze- ment appeared on his face, but it sud- denly vanished. His eves followed the TOO SURE 57 sprinter, and his finger stopped the re- cording hand of his watch as he crossed the line. "What time did you get?” whispered the excited Creighton. "Eighteen and one-fifth seconds,” re- plied the trainer in a voice whose calm- ness surprised the junior. “Not bad,” he added. "Not bad!” exclaimed his amazed companion. "What-” Todd slapped him heartily on the back. "Is this all that’s been bother- ing you?” he said, his sides quaking with suppressed mirth. "All!” exploded Fred. "Come on; let’s get out of here be- fore they hear us. Creighton, I’m sur- prised at you. You get in and dig when your race comes and you’ll do all right.” "But-he made it in eighteen-one,” protested the wondering junior. "So could you if you had to,” was Todd’s mysterious reply. CHAPTER VIII. A GLEAM OF LIGHT. QBEDIENT to Todd’s wishes, Creighton ceased making his five- o’clock pilgrimages to the oval. The trainer had refused to give any ex- planations, saying that the joke was too good to give away this early in the game. “If I were a betting man, I’m afraid I’d be tempted to place a wad with this Tapwell myself-but I’m not,” he had remarked. A change had come over Creighton during the last few days. He had be- gun to have a great deal of confidence in his trainer, and his hat would now fit easily on his head. Saturday, the day of the meet, ar- rived at last, and after a quiet fore- noon Scott turned out in full force and made its way to the athletic field. As Fred walked in front of the grand stand, on his way to the door to the dressing room, he caught sight of a cer- tain familiar figure on one of the higher tiers of seats. He ran up the aisle and grasped heartily the hand of a middle- aged man who seemed as pleased as he at the meeting. "Well, of all things! I never ex- pected to see you here, dad!” Creighton exclaimed. "And you, Eva?” She sat next to his father. "Allow me to make several introduc- tions,” broke in Mr. Creighton. "This gentleman on my right is Mr. Stone, of Tartown.” "Your father, Eva?” "Of course.” "Mr. Stone and I have been friends a good many years,” the elder Creigh- ton explained. "And here. Fred, are two gentlemen I believe you have heard of before-Mr. Graham and Grant Sterling, the world’s professional cham- pion in the furlong. Mr. Graham is his manager and trainer.” In bewilderment Creighton acknowl- edged the introduction, for the two men before him were the two he had watched so many mornings on the oval. Sterling was the athlete who had worn the Tartown upper. "Don’t look so stupefied, Fred,” said his father, amused at his son’s absolute dumfoundment. "I am going to con- fess to a little underhanded work.” Fred’s surprise only grew, to the keen enjoyment of the several seated before him. Eva’s eyes twinkled. •	"When I got your answer to my let- ter,” Creighton, senior, went on, "I was completely up in the air. I decided that I must find a means to knock a little of the-I’ll mention it in a whisper- conceit-but you needn’t be embar- rassed-out of you. T finally hit on the plan of hiring Mr. Sterling, the profes- sional, to do some fancy sprinting for your sole benefit. I corresponded with my old friend, Mr. Stone, and he wrote an anonymous note for me.” “I wasn’t able to deliver it myself," 58 TOP NOTC11 M AC5 AZIN F. Stone put in, “but I had a friend of mine, a Mr. Clemens, do it for me.” “So that explains Clemens’ mission in^Scott,” said young Creighton. He chuckled on wondering what Clemens' emotions might have been had he known the note's contents. Evidently he had no knowledge at all of the earlier running of Sterling. He had no doubt conceived the idea of training his star man on the track where the crucial race would be run, and had set the training hour a little later than Ster- ling’s. “Then I’m not to run against Mr. Sterling?” said young Creighton, with some relief. “Certainly not,” replied his father. “I merely hired him to make you see that there could be such a thing as a chance of your losing. I’m here to-day to see how my scheme panned out. Were you so confident of winning half an hour ago ?” “No. And I'm not confident now,” Fred stated emphatically. “But what made you cancel our date, Eva ?” he asked. “When I realized that it meant break- ing training rules for you, I couldn’t do otherwise,” she replied. “I want Tartown to win, of course, but not by taking advantage of any one. Well, father, don’t you think we’d better be going to our own section of the bleach- ers ?” “And I’ve got to report now myself,” said Fred. All was excitement in the dressing room which had to serve for the mem- bers of both teams. The secret was out. Tartown had discovered the greatest speed marvel in the history of athletics-that is, Clemens, the coach, had discovered him. Clemens had al- lowed his brother, who knew somewhat of conditioning himself, to direct the athlete. And-all the training had been done at an early hour in the morning on the Scott oval. Tartowners were bubbling over with optimism. The find would also run in the relay and assure the winning of that event. Todd’s at- titude toward all this talk was a little puzzling to Creighton. The ttainer seemed not a bit impressed. Beedle was the discovery’s name, and he was much in evidence in the dress- ing room. Creighton surmised that rec- ognition of his ability had gone to his head. Suddenly Creighton remembered that he had a question he would like to ask the man. He approachcd him. “Do you remember the dancc a few weeks ago at Tartown?” he asked him. “Sure," the other replied. “Some one told me you were Creighton early in the evening, and I pointed you out to Mr. Clemens, who has trained me.” Creighton was taken aback. Was that all it had amounted to? ‘ But why did you fellows clear out as soon as you saw me watching you?” “You don't think that was our rea- son for going?” the marvel laughed. “No. Clemens had come to tell me it was time to go home and to bed.” The frankness of this explanation satisfied Creighton. After a few more words he returned to the Scott side of the room. The afternoon wore on until the time drew near for the two-twenty. No, the meet did not hinge on this event. The furlong was not the last event on the program, either. It occupied its usual place. Tust before the last call was given, Todd drew Creighton aside and spoke a few words of advice into his ear. “Just start out with the gun and tear,” he said. “Don’t be afraid of any one. Run your own race.” The athletes went to the starting line, and Fred noticed the expression of chagrin that marred the phenom’s countenance as he drew his position from the starter’s hat. But Creighton did not guess just then what was trou- bling Beedle. Three men were entered from each collcge. Beedle drew the pole, and Creighton the next position. Beedle’s knees trembled as he crouched, and Creighton noticed it. “Is he getting nervous?” he wondered. The crowds in the grand stands were on their feet, and the whole trackside blazed with colors. Arms were waving pennants, and hoarse voices were yell- ing. The starter’s pistol spoke, and Creighton left his holes abreast his rival. And then-to Creighton-an amazing thing happened, or, rather, didn’t happen. He had confidently ex- pected to see a flying figure buzz past him and shoot round the turn into the straightaway. But nothing of the sort took place. Instead, he was amazed to find himself still in the lead when there were but seventy yards left to go. But he dared not look behind; Todd’s rules were strictly against such tactics. The other might be teasing him; might be holding back on purpose, intending to skim into the lead in the last few yards, and thus play himself up to the bleachers. The tape was parted by Fred Creigh- ton’s chest, and he had time to turn around before the Tartown speed demon crossed the line. Before he had time to give voice to his astonishment, Todd had him by the arm and was leading him to a quieter spot. “You poor simp!” exclaimed the trainer in his characteristic vein. “Aren’t you hep yet ?” Then something dawned on Creigh- ton. They were standing near the post where the milers were already lining up. “Can it be that-” “What else? We were looking di- rectly down the track that morning, and couldn’t judge very well. The posts aren’t marked, and Beedle-” “Started all those trial sprints from the mile post," put in Creighton. “No wonder he made it in eighteen some- thing. It’s only a hundred and seventy- five yards!” “Do it yourself, couldn’t you?” Todd laughed. “But they’re calling out the result of the furlong. What’s that? Hear that, Fred? Megaphone man says twenty-two seconds flat, breaking the record!” "What I’m thinking of is Clemens, the poolist,” said Creighton, laughing. “Yes,” acquiesced the trainer. “I have positive information that he put up all the money Tapwell bet. But say. you have never told me what put you on to the doings at the track?” “Ask Clemens,” was Creighton’s re- ply-	_ The Swiss President THE most modest and unassuming ruler in Europe is undoubtedly the President of the Swiss Confederation. It is an astounding fact, but even in his own country his name is not widely known, and if a Swiss who resided out- side his native land were asked the name of Helvetia’s official head, he would invariably express complete ignorance on that point. The president, who is elected by the federal assembly, holds the office for only one year, from January ist to De- cember 31st, and usually the vice presi- dent succeeds him. His chief duty is to direct his country’s foreign policy, for most of the internal administration is in the hands of the cantons or dis- tricts. There are thirty-five cantons, each of which is represented at the two Houses of Parliament. The president this year is Mr. Ed- mund Schultheff, and his official sal- ary is twenty-five hundred dollars, with an additional three thousand dollars for expenses. He has a federal council of seven, which forms a sort of cabinet, and each member receives twenty-four hundred dollars per annum. te S oiiarcjr laiKjlo i % Lyonrle HE director of the Central Film	Corporation-Bill Wright-finished his expo- sition of the latest script and put it down before him on the desk, gazing inquiringly at the faces of Rowland Harding, the lead, and Edith Morrow, who played opposite him. They maintained the silence for a space, and Harding returned the direc- tor’s gaze a little sullenly. Edith was quiet, with a calm, introspective look in her clear blue eyes that seemed to indicate that she was so busy with her thoughts that she had heard nothing. This, however, as both knew, was not the case. Finally Harding broke the silencc. just before it began to be awkward. “Nothing doing, Bill,” he said, shak- ing his head. “There is absolutely nothing stirring.” “What do you mean?" queried Wright, flashing a quick glance at him from his keen eyes. “Just what I say. T won’t do it,” Harding announced calmly, with flat decision in his even tones. “You’ll have to get a double for me in the stunt.” learsoiL A stunt double is a dare-devil of the films who takes the place of the lead in a dangerous scene. Some stars are never “doubled,” preferring to take their own risks; some are always dou- bled. It is a question merely of per- sonality and temperament-not to say courage. The scene under discussion was risky; there was no question of that. The script called for the hero to take a jump from the top of a freight train, going at a dangerous rate of speed, to the top of a freight standing on the next track. Not only that, but the heroine was to be in his arms. It called for a nervy piece of work where a misstep meant, at the least, broken bones, but it had been planned by a scenario writer who had never done anything more dangerous than defying a hat boy in a Broadway restaurant. “I won’t do it,” Harding repeated. “My value to the pictures ib too great for me to risk my life doing a stunt like that. I also insist that you get a double for Edith in that scene. It’s much too dangerous for her to attempt. It’s-” “Speak for yourself, Mr. Harding!” THE SQUARE TRIANGLE	61 flared up Edith at this, casting him a glance from her usually calm eyes that caused the blood to mount in his cheeks. “I am quite capable of judging how valuable / am to the films without the help of any one.” “Oh, I say, Edith,” protested Hard- ing. “I was thinking only of your own good-” “I have thought of all that,” broke in the director, with a troubled glance at Edith. “It can’t be done; there will have to be no doubling in this scene. It’s got to be a close-up. I’m going to shoot it from the top of the car.” "Well, I won’t do it,” said Harding stubbornly. “As you know very well, it is not a question of my personal courage”-here he glanced obliquely at Edith-“I’ve done enough stunts for you to know that. It is only-” “How about me? I’m going to do it,” cut in Edith wickedly. “And you won’t.” “Well, you’re very foolish,” Harding persisted. “There’s no use in arguing about it,” said the director. “If you really won’t do it, then I’ll have to get some one else for the lead in this script, because the whole story hinges on it.” Harding and Edith looked at him quickly. “You haven’t got anybody,” declared Harding. “I will have by to-morrow morning. There’s a new man coming-Clifton Rogers.” Clif Rogers coming!” echoed Edith and Harding in one voice. A steel- blue gleam crept into Harding’s eyes, and the lines about his jaw hardened. The good old-fashioned triangle was complete once more. He and Edith and Clifton Rogers had worked together for the same company before the organization of the Central Film Corporation. Rogers and he had been rivals then, the hypotenuse of the triangle being Edith. Neither one had appeared to make much headway. The girl had liked them both. When the triangle was broken up by the shifting of Edith and Harding to the new com- pany, Harding had breathed a sigh of relief at having a clear field once more. The Central’s studio was in Fort Lee, New Jersey, and with Rogers working in Hollywood, California, it had seemed to Harding that things would be easier. They were not. Edith was as far removed as ever, and although she seemed to like him as much as she ever had, he was getting nowhere in his suit. He stole a look at her now. She was gazing at Bill Wright with that familiar, lovable, far-away light in her eyes, but there was a softer gleam, it seemed to Harding, in them now. He knew what it was-the thought of Clifton Rogers, and the knowledge of this made him furious. Not that he and Rogers were ene- mies. They had been very good friends in spite of their dual aspirations to Edith. Edith had distributed her fa- vors evenly, however, and neither could say that he had the advantage. TT. ^LIFTON ROGERS came the next day. A tall, good-looking chap he was, as handsome in his Grecian-god way as was Harding in his more rugged type. They greeted each other in a friendly enough manner, with even a tinge of warmth in their tones, and stood chatting until Edith came in. When Rogers saw her he detached himself from the little group of actors that had formed around him, and hur- ried to her. “Hello. Clif!” she said as he took her hand. “Edith-it’s good to see you again,” he said. She looked up at him gratefully, and 62 TOP-NOTCH MAGAZINE he mistook the light that was in her eyes. “Will you marry mer" he asked in his impulsive, impetuous way. “ 'Nobody asked me, sir/ ” Edith quoted, but her eyes sobered in an instant. “No, certainly not.” she said decidedly. “You're much too rapid a worker. Give me a chance to get used to seeing you around again, will you? Talk about speed !” They both laughed. “I thought maybe you had decided.” Rogers apologized, “so I took a chance.” Harding watched the pair with dark- ening eyes. The Central’s studio is an industrious place, and there was no time for the play and cross-play of emotions ex- cept before the camera man. Rogers started work that afternoon. The company owned a short spur of track a few miles back of the studio, where they took their railroad pictures. The actors, director, and camera man crowded into two touring cars and drove out there. “Now,” said Bill Wright, as they stood in front of the freight trains, “I don’t want to have any retake on this, so let's rehearse it once slowly.” The camera was fixed firmly on the roof of the train. In front of the cam- era were Rogers and Edith. “Going to be nervous, little girl ?” asked Rogers, smiling. “Of course not,” she flashed back, “and don't call me little girl.” “The train is going to pull slowly past the dead freight-very slowly,” said Wright to them from his place be- hind the camera. “This is just to get your distance, so that you can be a little familiar with the jump when you make it. Jump in the direction we’re going-and don’t try to stop short. Tt will cost you a couple of legs if you do. Take Edith by the waist; and you, Edith, jump at the exact moment he does, but.be careful not to deflect him. “And, Clifhe added, "if anything happens to Edith and you come out of it alive. I’m going to bash in several inches of your head.” He looked at Edith with wearied, worrying eyes. “Oh, don’t worry, Big Bill.” She laughed back at him. “Nothing will happen.” The rehearsal went off as scheduled, and the train pulled back to the starting point. “Think you ha\e it, Edith?” asked Rogers solicitously. “Yes; don’t worry about me. You have the hard part of this,” she an- swered. “Not afraid, are you?” she asked. “Afraid? With you acting as if it were just a little vacation trip! You would never know it, any way, if I were.” he replied, smiling into her eyes. “Now!” said Wright very soberly. “And for Heaven’s sake let’s have no accidents. Oh, wouldn’t you rather I put some one else into this picture, Edith?” he asked, gazing at her in- tently. “No; certainly not,” she hurled back at him. Big Bill grunted, as was his way when moved, and motioned to the engineer. “Go ahead!” he shouted. “Camera!” The wheels of the engine began to gain speed, and the whirring, monotonous grind of the camera was heard over the jarring brakes and grunting ex- haust. The speed of the train increased rapidly. Poised in front of the camera were Edith and Rogers, his arm around her waist with a clutch that was like a vise. In their tensed, expectant faces could be seen the strain under which they labored as they waited for the train to come abreast of the stalled freight. Now they were alongside. They poised themselves on their toes. THE SQUARE TRIANGLE 63 "Action! Jump!” rasped Wright above the noise of the train. The two jumped on the word, landed on the freight roof, lurched forward, regained their balance, lurched again, and tumbled in a breathless heap as the flying train ripped past. They were waiting on the ground when Wright came running back to them. “Fine-wonderful!” he congrat- ulated them. “Hurt ?" “No,” they both answered. “Except that I feel a little shaken up,” added Edith. “Whew!” exclaimed Wright in a low tone, wiping his forehead. “I’m glad that’s over. I was sorry just as soon as I gave the word,” be said to Edith. III. DOGERS went through with the rest ^ of the picture, and on its release it proved to be an unqualified success. There was a lot of ability-hitherto latent-in Rogers, and if he had not attained to a reputation such as Hard- ing had made, it was only because he had not been given the opportunity in his former position. As for Edith, she seemed again to distribute her favors evenly between Harding and Rogers; to the outward eye there was scarcely any difference between her treatment of the two. They both courted her assiduously and persistently. Harding, however, felt that there was a difference, and that he was on the weak side of it. He expressed this in a subsequent conver- sation with Edith. “No,” said Edith in reply to his question. “T’ve said no to you three times this week. Nobody is going to marry me yet, Rowland,” she added more softly. “You know, I really like you an awTful lot and-” “I know you used to,” Harding said a little bitterly, “but since the time I refused to go through with that darned stunt pictu.e-” “That has never made any difference to me,” she cut in, but there was a shade of dubiousness in her tone, and he sensed it instinctively. “Yes, it has,” he insisted. “You think that I’m lacking in courage be- cause I refused to risk my life for a film. You should know better than “I was willing to risk my life,” Edith broke in, led into the argument through his persistence, “and so was Clif Rogers.” Harding was silent for a space, star- ing off into nothingness, as he mused upon the case of Clifton Rogers. “That’s the trouble,” he said finally. “Clif. You think that because he took a risk that I side-stepped that-” “Nothing of the sort,” she said. “I like Clif very much, as I do you, but your physical courage, or cowardice, or Clif’s, is nothing to me.” That was where the matter rested, then, for a while. Nevertheless, Hard- ing had hit very near to the truth. Al- though Edith had not expressed it, even to herself, there was a vague feeling in her mind that Clifton Rogers was the better man. She was a woman of unlimited courage herself and could, in her state of mind, scarcely be ex- pected to have patience with a man whom she suspected was lacking in that respect. It was not that she considered Hard- ing lacking-she knew that he possessed nerve of a sort-it was only that in one instance he had struck a false note by refusing to take a risk that she herself had accepted merely as incidental to her work. And then Clif Rogers had come back suddenly and gone right into the thing without a thought or a ques- tion. Whether she admitted the fact or not, it made a difference. Rogers, while he felt that there was 64 TOP-XOTCH MAGAZINE a certain warmth in her attitude to- ward him, did not know to what special gods to attribute it. He did not know that Harding had refused to perform the stunt which he himself had gone into so unhesitatingly. It was after Rogers had been there for seven or eight months that awaken- ing of a kind came to Edith. Awaken- ing, that is, to the points of difference -or rather similarity-between the two men. Perhaps the incident might not have happened if Rogers had known of the disagreement that had preceded his arrival. The scene was almost identical with the one that had been held before in Bill Wright’s little cubby-hole of an office. He had finished the exposition of a script that called for a hair-raising adventure on the part of Edith Morrow* and Rogers. Rogers looked at the director fixedly for a space. Finally he spoke: “Noth- ing doing, Bill.” He shook his head. “What do you mean ?” asked Wright, although he knew perfectly well. “Just what I say; I won’t do it,” Rogers said flatly. “You’ll have to get a double for me. My value to the pic- tures is too great for me to risk my life doing a stunt like that.” Thus unconsciously did Clifton Rog- ers repeat the exact words of Rowland Harding on a similar occasion. Edith looked up at him, startled for a moment, with the feeling that comes to one who thinks that some time, in a previous incarnation, perhaps, he has lived through a similar occurrence. Her mind flashed back to Harding, -and it occurred to her that in her thoughts she had either been unjust to him or over just to Rogers. She could not think it out yet. Through the haze of her reflections, Rogers’ words came to her. “And I think you ought to get a dou- ble for Edith,” he was saying. “Oh, never mir.d me,” she broke in wearily, “You people are so busy thinking about yourselves that you needn't bother about me. 1 am quite capable of taking care of myself.” Wright’s troubled gaze fell upon her then. “I was thinking of that, Edith,” he said slowly. “I am not much in favor of all these risks you are taking for the pictures. But my main busi- ness is to follow orders here-the or- der> from headquarters-and  have to give them what they want thus did rogers wipe out whatever advantage may have existed in his fa- vor he

seafaring man because as he said the nautical gen- tleman had told him that the parrot spoke spanish and arthur thought that it would help him in his study of that language but developments disillu- sioned him for when he repeated some of the classical castilian he had ac- quired from his feathered tutor to the maiden lady from whom he was taking lessons the result was disastrous one evening several weeks ago he came home in such jolly good humor that i asked him by how many runs the home team had won home team  he questioned ab- sently oh yes to be sure they won hands down three to one but i wasnt thinking of that dorothy i was thinking of the great bargain i struck to-day biggest thing ever what utterly impossible thing have you been buying now i asked i fully expect that some day you will come home and tell me that you have acquired a slightly damaged second- hand family tree what is the very wonderful bargain you have secured for answer arthur produced a piece of paper from his wallet exhibit a he said gleefully a pawn ticket for a classy gold hunting-case watch thin model seventeen jewels water- cooled radiator nonchoking carbu- retor fully equipped with peerless shock absorbers wind shield and one- man top a  model warranted not to skip skid or turn turtle arthur armitage oliver i asked what in the world are you talking -about  arthur laughed say dorothy he exclaimed i feel so chipper over this deal that i could kid the ears off an army mule but  am not an army mule i objected thats where i score one on the army he laughed but joking aside this ticket sure does represent some watch from the description of it i got from the fellow who sold me the ticket it must be a dead ringer on the one that i won in the tennis tournament the year we were married and that sure was some watch yes i agreed that was some watch-while it lasted but it didnt last long enough if i remember rightly a pickpocket relieved you of it the first time you wore it  top-notch magazine yes said arthur he did and he was some slick guy to get it he got my time all right ive always wanted to get another one like it and to-day when that fellow offered to sell me the ticket for five dollars after de- scribing the watch and telling me a hard-luck story of having to pawn it on account of having gone broke in a poker game i fell for it and bought the ticket arthur i said severely do you mean to stand there and tell me that you encouraged a poor man to lose money in a poker game the fact that you got the watch for five dollars is no excuse for such an act but i dont get the watch for five dollars said arthur there is some- thing like twenty-one-twenty to pay on it  twenty-one-twenty i exclaimed what for why replied arthur the fellow borrowed twenty dollars on it and- well i interrupted if he bor- rowed twenty dollars on it why in the world doesnt he pay it back  i dont see why in the world you should pay another mans honest debts dorothy said arthur when it comes to business you are absolutely hopeless a man pawns a watch for twenty dollars the watch is worth probably fifty dollars then as it is impossible for him to redeem the watch he sells tire ticket for five or ten dol- lars and the one who purchases the ticket has to repay the loan with legal interest added to get possession of the watch that is a straight business proposition now wasnt that just like a man the idea of telling me that giving a man five dollars for the privilege of paying his debts was a straight business proposition ts it any wonder that so many men fail in business why with ideas like that it is surprising that so many of them are successful but arthur is so headstrong-especially when he knows that he has made a business blunder-that i did not argue the matter further with him instead i reminded him that he had only twenty minutes to dress for mrs bouviers reception ii the next evening when arthur came home he brought the watch with him it really was an excellent- looking watch and i told him that i thought he had got it real cheap for five dollars but he protested i didnt get it for five dollars i had to pay the pawn- broker twenty-one-twenty for the watch no such thing i argued you gave the man five dollars for the pawn ticket and to my mind that repre- sents what you paid for the watch if you were foolish enough to assume the mans debts i cannot see that that has anything to do with the cost of the watch all right said arthur resignedly well let it go at that but there is something in the watch that didnt cost me a cent he snapped open the case and held it toward me for inspection good- ness me i exclaimed isnt he too awfully cute for anything i wonder who he is search me replied arthur who- ever pasted that picture in the case has a kid to be proud of arthur was right the picture in the case was that of the cutest dearest sweetest little boy that ever was he was about three years old with a chubby little face like you see in the pictures of cherubs in those quaint old european churches tight little curls covered every spot of his head where curls belong and i knew positively that more than a guess  they must be golden a pair of laugh- ing eyes which absolutely could not be anything but blue gazed into mine and --oh he had the cutest cunningest pair of dimples that ever won any ones heart i loved him the minute i laid eyes on his picture some kid believe me exclaimed arthur in a tone that was almost rev- erential say dorothy if we- the doorbell shrilled an impatient summons cutting short arthurs half- expressed thought and i am awfully glad it did i would not for worlds want you to know what  know he was going to say arthur called down the speaking tube and asked who was there he listened to the reply with a puzzled frown on his face and then he pressed the button that opened the door in the lower hall in a short time a tall dis- tinguished-looking man stood on the threshold of the apartment and ar- thur invited him to enter i trust you will pardon the liberty i have taken in calling on you mr oliver he said as he entered but as my time in your city is limited i thought it best to call upon you at once this he continued producing a card and handing it to arthur will tell you who i am and the nature of my business hamilton w keene investigator read arthur aloud mr keene he continued i am very pleased to meet you i know that my wife is just dy- ing to learn the object of your visit permit me to present her dorothy this is mr keene mr keene my wife mrs oliver-the brains of the establishment wasnt that nice of him mr keene smilingly acknowledged the introduction and after we were seated he plunged right into business mr oliver he said you may not be aware of it but i sat next to you in the trolley car this evening as you were coming home when you pulled your watch out of your pocket i no- ticed it particularly because it is like the one which t carry but when you opened it and i beheld the picture which it contained my interest in your timepiece went up about a thousand per cent are you aware mr oliver that that picture is a photograph of little raoul delacour who was kidnaped from his home in chelsea several weeks ago  arthur was too astonished to reply and no wonder for it seems to me that every time the dear boy does any- thing there is always a kick to it as he says when he bought that pawn ticket for the watch and obligated him- self to pay another persons honest debts i am sure that he had no idea that he was also getting mixed up in a kidnaping case goodness gracious mr keene i exclaimed it isnt possible that any one would kidnap such a sweet child the very idea i am sorry to say that it is not only possible replied mr keene but it is a fact the child disappeared mys- teriously several weeks ago and his parents whom i know personally are nearly frantic i have been unable to take up the case as i am at present engaged on a very important one for the government nevertheless when i saw little raouls photograph in mr olivers watch i determined t follow the clew what makes it all the more mysterious is the fact that the little fellows parents never have had his picture taken and i did not know that there was a photograph of him in ex- istence if that is the case i said that photograph may have been taken by some one who was implicated in the kidnaping that is quite possible mrs oliver agreed mr keene <rYVill you permit 70 TO P* N OTC11 M AG AZIN E me to examine the photograph, Mr. Oliver?” For reply Arthur handed the watch to Mr. Keene without comment. The poor boy seemed dazed at the turn events were taking-. Mr. Keene took the watch and gazed at the photograph long and intently. "Poor kid,” he finally remarked; “it is his picture all right. Mr. Oliver, would you mind telling me how it came into your possession?” "I will be only too glad to do so/' replied Arthur, and lie told Mr. Keene all about purchasing the pawn ticket and redeeming the watch. “And the fellow from whom you purchased the ticket was a stranger to you?” questioned Mr. Keene, when Ar- thur had finished. ‘‘Absolutely,” replied Arthur. “I never laid eyes on him before.” "Would you know him if you saw him again?” asked Mr. Keene. "I certainly would,” exclaimed Ar- thur. ‘‘I’d know that guy in a mil- lion.” "If by any chance you should hap- pen to see him,” said Mr. Keene, "have the police authorities shadow him. They may be able to locate the child through him. I am extremely sorry that other duties prevent me from fol- lowing this clew. It seems to me that the only thing we can do is to turn over what evidence we have to the local police and let them get busy, but I would much prefer to put the matter into the hands of a good private detec- tive who could devote all his energies to the case.” "I wonder-” I said, looking at Arthur. "So do I,” said Arthur, who seemed to sense my unuttered thought. "The poor dub would be tickled to death to be called into this case.” "To whom are you referring?” in- quired Mr. Keene. "A local, half-baked detective,” re- plied Arthur. "Mrs. Oliver has an ex- aggerated opinion cf him. Thinks he’s a wonder and all that kind of stuff.” “No such thing,” I expostulated, “but I certainly do give Mr. Judson credit for having been successful in every ca-e he has undertaken, and he is cer- tainly energetic and enthusiastic.” “Just the man we want,” said Mr. Keene. “Would it be possible to have him in? I know that the Delacours would approve of any step I may take with a view to recovering the child, and if Mr. Judson is agreeable I will turn the case over to him and acquaint him with all I know about the kidnap- mg, Arthur got Mr. Judson on the phone and urged him to come over; told him it was the chance of his heretofore in- nocent and uneventful young life, and a lot more stuff of the same kind. Really, I think it is awful the way Arthur talks to the poor man. but Mr. Judson seems to take it good-naturedly. He asked Arthur a few questions, and told him he would be over in a jiffy. III. \\/HEN Mr. Judson arrived, Arthur introduced him to Mr. Keene, who seemed to be very favorably im- pressed with him, and after a few com- monplace remarks he started telling him all about the kidnaping case. Then he showed him the picture in the watch, and told him how it had come into Arthur’s possession. Mr. Judson listened very attentively to everything Mr. Keene said, and when Mr. Keene showed him the watch he took it and examined it very critically. "This is practically a new watch,” he said. “The case does not show any evidence of it having been carried very much.” Then he fixed his attention on the photograph, and after he had gazed at it for a few minutes a happy thought seemed to strike him. MORE THAN A GUESS 71 “Mrs. Oliver,” he said, turning to me, “can you let me have a cup of hot water and a teaspoon ?” “Why, certainly,” I replied, wonder- ing- what in the world he wanted with them. I went to the kitchen, drew a cup of hot water, and, returning to the living room, I placed it on the table in, front of Mr. Judson. “Mr. Oliver,” he said, addressing Arthur, “I am going to take liberties with your watch. Won't hurt it a bit. Just want to prove a theory I have formed.” “Go the limit, old scout,” said Arthur heartily. “I'm in this thing to the finish, even if you have to drain the spring of that watch to the last drop of water.” I was all pins and needles wonder- ing what Mr. Judson was going to do, but he didn’t keep us waiting very long. He filled the teaspoon with water, and then very carefully poured it into that part of the case containing the photo- graph. He let the water remain for a minute or so and poured it back into the cup. Then he poured another spoonful of hot water into the case, and after letting it remain for a while he poured that also into the cup. He re- peated the process about a half dozen times, and then he was able to lift the moistened photograph from its place. Then he took his handkerchief and wiped the case dry. looking intently at the inside as he did so. A smile of triumphant surprise flashed over-his face as he closed the case and laid the watch on the table. “So far so good.” he announced, rub- bing his hands together. “Mr. Keene,” he continued, addressing that gentle- man, “when you showed me that pho- tograph in the watch I was puzzled. I could not understand why any one who had anything to do with the kidnaping would take the chance of putting an incriminating photograph in the case before pawning the watch. If it was put there, it must have been for a pur- pose. Can you think of any reason why any one would put a photograph into a watch when about to pawn it t “No,” replied Mr. Keene slowly, “I cannot.” “Neither could I, until I happened to think that it might have been placed there to facilitate the pawning of the watch.” “But I fail to see how the picture would enhance the value of the watch,” said Mr. Keene. “It would enhance the value of the watch by covering up something which might prove a bar to its pawning,” as- serted Mr. Judson. “Pawnbrokers, as a rule, are unwilling to accept pledges that bear any engraved inscriptions upon them. Unredeemed pledges which bear any such engraving are very hard to sell. This watch bear£ an inscrip- tion on the inside of the case, and it was absolutely necessary that it be con- cealed before the kidnaper attempted to pawn it.” “Why do you think that the watch was pawned by the kidnaper ?” asked Mr. Keene. “Because,” replied Mr. Judson, “the photograph was made by an amateur. It's a mighty good photograph, but it is an amateur one just the same. You have said that there was no photograph of the child in existence. Consequently this photograph must nave been made after the child was stolen, and my the- ory is that it was made for a purpose. I will get you to verify that theory by and by. “The kidnaper has the child on his hands, safely hidden, of course; and it becomes necessary for. him to raise some funds,” Mr. Judson went on. “What is more logical than that the crook should turn to the place where he could most easily get money? He has the watch, but the inscription in- side the case is a bar to its pawning. He still has the negative of the photo 72 TOP-NOTCH MAGAZINE he took of the child, and he makes an extra print and pastes it in the case. The fact that Mr. Oliver acquired the watch with the photo in it will give color to my theory." "But,” objected Mr. Keene, "do you think that the kidnaper would take the chance of pawning a watch with the evidence of his crime pasted in it?" “A photograph in a pawned watch is as safely hidden as if it were locked up in a safe-deposit vault,” replied Mr. Judson. “The fact that the ticket was afterward sold to Mr. Oliver doesn’t prove anything except that the crook may have needed money so badly that he was willing to take a chance. This amateur photographer is also an ama- teur at the kidnaping game, and he is a purely local amateur at that.” “A local one!" exclaimed Mr. Keene. ‘‘Say, Mr. Judson, did the watch tell you that, too?" “Sure thing," replied Mr. Judson. “I’ll leave it to Mrs. Oliver," and he handed me the watch, opening it as he did so that I might read the inscrip- tion on the inside of the case. “Goodness, gracious me!” I ex- claimed, as I read it. “Arthur Armi- tage Oliver, this is really the most as- tonishing thing that has ever hap- pened," and I handed him the watch. Arthur took it and read the inscrip- tion. His face was a study in emo- tions. As they say in the moving pic- tures, he registered everything from surprise to unbelieving astonishment. “Well, T’ll be bombed!” he ex- claimed. “This is the identical watch I won at tennis two years ago V* TV. A FTER the excitement incident to the discovery that it was Arthur’s own watch that he had bought had died down, Mr. Judson went into further details. "The watch was stolen by a local crook, and an amateur one at that," he reiterated. "If it had been stolen by a professional pickpocket, it would have been disposed of immediately. Those fellows don’t take any chances. The fellow who stole it feared to sell it, but when his needs became press- ing he concealed the evidence of his crime beneath the picture of the kid- naped child. Would it be possible for you, Mr. Keene, to get the Delacours on the long-distance phone?” “Certainly,” replied Mr. Keene. “If Mrs. Oliver will be so good as to let me use the instrument. But what is the idea ?” “I have a hunch that the Delacours have received a duplicate of that pho- tograph within the last week,” replied Mr. Judson. “The kidnaper made the picture with the sole idea of impress- ing them with the fact that he meant business and of proving to them that he has the child.” Mr. Keene went to the phone, and, after what seemed an age, succeeded in getting the Delacours. It really was remarkable how Mr. Judson had grasped every detail of the case, for in his conversation with Mr. Delacour, Mr. Keene learned that a letter had been delivered to them in some mys- terious manner. The letter, Mr. Dela- cour stated, had contained a small pho- tograph of their son, and the writer had stated that the child would be re- turned if satisf actor)' arrangements could be made about the ransom. Mr. Delacour further said that the writer had not stated the amount he desired for the return of the child, but had intimated that arrangements might be made through the personal columns of a prominent New York daily paper. “A rank amateur,” exclaimed Mr. Judson, when Mr. Keene repeated what Mr. Delacour had told him. “He's got the child and he’s all up in the air about landing the ransom. He's as good as caught. Mr. Keene, I think that you MORE THAN A GUESS 73 may safely assure the anxious parents that we are on the right track and that the child will be returned to them very shortly.” Mr. Keene did as Mr. Judson ad- vised. and I know the assurance must have been very heartening to the par- ents. After telling them to be patient for a few days more, Mr. Keene hung up. Then, after complimenting Mr. Judson on the able manner in which he had taken hold of the case, and urging him to give it his best efforts, he announced that he must be going. After promising to call upon us when again in our city, he took leave of us, accompanied by Mr. Judson, and Ar- thur and I sat up until nearly midnight, talking over the wonderful affair. Mr. Judson called Arthur up at the office the next day and got the name of the pawnbroker from whom he had re- deemed the watch. Arthur told me this when he came home that evening, and added that “Jake” would be around that evening to discuss the matter, and 1 knew that if he came he surely would have something to report. Sure enough, when Mr. Judson called later in the evening, he was fairly bubbling over with good spirits. “Well, Jake, old man,” said Arthur, "what’s the good word? You look mighty happy.” “The smiles are indications of suc- cess,” replied Mr. Judson. "I’ve done a good day’s work. I called upon our pawnbroker friend, but at first he didn't seem to be able to give me any definite information as to who had pawned the watch. Said that the name Lacey on the ticket was no doubt a fictitious one and that he thought it would be a waste of time to try to locate any one by that name and try to fasten the theft of the watch on him. Of course, I hadn't told him anything about the kid- naping case, as I thought it best to let him think that I was merely trying to trace the fellow who stole the watch. "I asked him whether the fellow had pawned anything besides the watch, and, after consulting his books, he said that a camera had been pawned by a man named Lacey on the same day as the watch. "At my request, he got the camera and let me examine it. It proved to be a camera such as would take a pic- ture like the one that was pasted in the watch. The camera seemed to re- fresh his memory, and he said that, to the best of his recollection, the man calling himself Lacey was about five foot ten, well set up, dark-complex- ioned, and fairly well dressed. What did the fellow who sold you the pawrn ticket look like, Air. Oliver?” "Short, red-headed chap,” replied Arthur. "Looked like a pugilist.” "Lacey evidently gave him the ticket to dispose of,” commented Mr. Judson. "Didn’t care to take any chances him- self. After leaving the pawnshop, I stopped in at several others, and, after showing my authority, I asked whether a man giving the name of Lacey had pawned anything with them lately. They looked over their records, but could not find that he had. Finally I struck an obscure place near the northern end of the town, where the pawnbroker found that he had a pledge which had been left there by a man giving that name. It was a tennis racket and it proved to be a high-grade one at that. It had the letter ‘L’ en- graved on the butt of the handle, and it looked as if it might have belonged to a professional. Did you ever meet a professional tennis player by the name of Lacey, Mr. Oliver?” "No, can’t say that I ever did,” re- plied Arthur. "But say! No, it couldn’t be. The idea seems preposter- ous.” "What idea ?” asked Mr. Judson. '“Why,” replied Arthur, “the fellow from whom I won the finals in that tennis tournament was named Lessig.” 74 TOP-NOTCH MAGAZINE “Ah!” exclaimed Mr. Judson, rub- bing his hands together. “This sounds interesting. What became of this man Lessig f" “Search me/* replied Arthur. “He was a poor .sport, and 1 didn't culti- vate his acquaintance. He got as mad as a wet hen over losing the champion- ship, and some of the fellows at the clubhouse said they heard him vowing to get square with the dude who de- feated him, but I didn't take much stock in the chatter. Wonder if he could have pinched the watch from my lockei the day after the match ? I went out there to limber up the next day. Remember, Dorothy?" "I certainly do,” T replied. “It was when you returned home from the club that you first missed your watch.” “Case is closed against Lessig-alias Lacey,” exclaimed Mr. Judson. “He’s the man we want to find. Guess I’ll tear myself away and get busy trying to locate him. Call you up to-morrow and let you know how I make out.” V. IT was late in the afternoon of the next day when Mr. Judson called up and asked for Arthur. I told him that Arthur had not yet returned, but that I expected him any minute. “All right, Mrs. Oliver,” he said. “Won’t you tell Mr. Oliver that I’ve located a fellow who goes by the name of Lacey? Lives out on the Bluebell Road, about five miles from town. I haven't been able to get out there to- day, and I was wondering wliether Mr. Oliver would drive me out there in his car. I ihink the fellow is the one we are looking for.” "How perfectly exciting,” I said. “Have you seen the man ?” “No.” replied Mr. Judson; “but from what I’ve learned of him T think it is the tennis sharp who was known as Lessig.” Just then Arthur came in, and when T told him what Mr. Judson had said he called to him over the phone and told him to come right up and the car would be ready for the run out to Bluebell Road. Of course it was absolutely out of the question to let them go aione, and when Mr. Judson arrived the three of us started. It was a perfect evening, and the July sun was just beginning to lose its intense glare when we struck the coun- try. Our car purred along, like the perfect machine that it is, and, had it not been for the excitement of the chase, T would have given myself over to the enjoyment of the occasion. Wre bowled along mile after mile, passing very few houses, and when the meter showed that we had traveled about five miles along the Bluebell Road, Arthur halted a man who looked like a native and asked him if he knew where a man named Lacey lived. "Lacey ?” mused the man. “Seems to me that’s the name of the fellow who moved into the old Deering place a couple of weeks ago. He's a young fellow and lives there with an old lady who looks as if she might be his mother. They've got a little chip of a girl run- ning around the place.” “Sounds as if it might be the man Ave are looking for.” commented Arthur. “Where is the place?” “Turn to the left, first road you come to,” replied the man. “You can’t miss it. It is the only house there.” Arthur thanked him and proceeded to follow his directions. As we turned into the road indicated, Mr. Judson told him to drive slowly so that he might take a look around and pick up any possible clews. As we neared the place a mite of a girl in a gingham pinafore, with a cute little blue and white check sunbonnet on her head, came racing out of the house. She seemed to be pursuing MORE THAN A GUESS 75 something. Presently she caught it, and, with a shriek of delight, she straightened up, holding the cutest and most adorable little kitten by the tail and swinging it around as if it were something inanimate. I never before in all my life saw such cruelty. It made me awfully angry. "Stop the car, Arthur!” I managed to gasp, and as he did so I called to the child: "Little girl, put that kitten down immediately. Do you hear?" The little vixen paid absolutely no attention to my command, but at the sound of my voice an aged woman ap- peared at the door of the house and took in the scene at a glance. "Ruth," she shrilled, "put that kitten down. Do you hear ?” "The little imp stopped her antics and glanced at the old woman. Then the kitten was given an extra violent swing and deliberately tossed into a clump of bushes just as Arthur started the car. "I wonder whether there are any more children in that house,” said Mr. Judson as we pulled away. "I should hope not,” commented Ar- thur. "Not if that is a sample of the rest.” "I never saw such heartlessness in all my life,” I exclaimed indignantly. "Why, that child has evidently had ab- solutely no bringing up. The poor, dear little kitten. To think that a little girl would-” I stopped as an ut- terly impossible thought flashed into my mind. "Stop the car, Arthur, please,” I said. "What's up now?” he asked, as he complied with my request. "I wish to go back to that house on foot,” I replied. "Now please don’t ask any questions, but do exactly as I say. Turn the car around and keep the engine going, and when you see me wave my handkerchief from the gate rush down as quickly as you can and pick me up.” "All right,” replied Arthur. "1 don't understand what it is all about, but I’ll do it.” When I reached the gate of the house the child was playing around the gar- den, while the old lady was puttering around among her plants. I stopped and called to her. "Madam,” I said, as she approached, "I came back to see whether you would let me have the little kitten to take home. I am afraid the little girl i* making its life misera- ble.” "I would gladly let you have it,” re- plied the old lady, "but I am afraid that Ruth would miss it very much. She is very fond of it, aldiough she does mistreat it dreadfully.” Just then the kitten emerged from the clump of bushes where it had been tossed, and started racing toward us. The child saw it, and. with a shriek of delight, started racing after it. "Oh,” I cried, "she will hurt it!” As the little imp pounced upon it, I clutched my heart and staggered, as if about to fall. "What is it ?” asked the old lady anxiously. "Are you ill ?” "Water,” I gasped. "My heart!” The old lady started for the house, and I waved my handkerchief wildly to Arthur. As the car raced up the road, the kitten escaped from its tor- mentor and came running toward me with the child in full cry after it. As the car stopped at the gate, I rescued the kitten from its tormentor. "I want my kitten,” wailed the youngster. "Come with me and I will give it to you,” I said, running toward the car. The child tugged at my skirts as I ran, and, as I reached the car, I handed the poor animal to Mr. Judson. Then I picked the child up bodily and sprang into the car. "Drive like mad,” 1 told Arthur, and he did. When we were several miles 76 TOP-NOTCII MAGAZINE away, Arthur stopped the car and turned to me. “What’s the big idea?” he asked. “What are you going to do with that kid ?” For reply I tugged at the strings of the little blue-check sunbonnet. They were tied in a hard knot, and 1 had quite a time to undo them, but finally I succeeded. Then I pulled the bonnet off. “This,” I said, exposing a little round head covered with the cutest little golden curls, “is the answer.” “The Delacour kid!” gasped Arthur. “He's the original of the picture in the watch, all right.” “Well, I’ll be-blowed!” exclaimed Mr. Judson. “But how in the deuce did you guess that it was a boy, Mrs. Oliver?” “That was more than a guess, Mr. Judson,’’ 1 replied, laughing happily. “It is the result of nature study. If you know anything at all about little girls, you should know that they never pick little kittens up by their tails. They cuddle them like they do their doll babies.” “That’s a new one on me,” said Mr. Judson. “Guess I’ll have to take a course in nature study.” When we reached home 1 telephoned immediately to Mrs. Delacour and told her that we had recovered the child. It is needless to state that she was over-- joyed. She said that she would motor right over and get him. She said that it would take about two hours to make the run, and then she asked me what little Raoul was doing. “Oh,” I replied, “T wish you could see him! He’s marching up and down the room, as happy as a king, swinging his little kitten by the tail. It looks just too cute for anything.” “Judson’s going out to get that fel- low Lacey,” said Arthur, as I hung up. “I’d like to be on the jury that con- victs him. He’d get his all right. About fifteen years'd be the fitting end of a perfect jay.” The Other Fellow's Troubles TTHE tendency often is to believe that others are belter situated than ourselves. Those who are earning sal- aries and paying the higher prices charged for nearly all articles of food and for many articles of apparel, are almost unanimous in believing that the farmer has the best of it. But a farmer not far from Boston, who says he is the owner of a fair- sized improved farm, stocked with horses, cows, swine, and chickens, has written to a Boston newspaper an- nouncing that he cannot make wages, under present conditions, and that he is ready to sell his property and work for some one else. Perhaps the discontented farmer doe- not know the other part of the story as well as he knows his own. Why Didn’t He? AN amusing anecdote is told of Lord Cardigan, who fought in the Crimean War, when a coalition of Eng- land, France. Turkey, and Sardinia fought Russia. Cardigan was a chol- eric old general, whose bursts of tem- per were a constant dread of all his subordinates in the army. It once happened that provisions for the troops ran very short; in fact, the army almost faced a famine. One morning, when the general appeared for breakfast, the cook came before him and said, in a troubled lone: “Pardon me, your Iordstjip; I have set the table in the dining tent, as usual, hut there isn’t any bread!” “No bread?” roared the general. “Why didn’t you buy some?” “There isn’t any to be had; the stores are all run out,” replied the cook. “Well, don’t stand there like a bloom- ing idiot! Why under the sun don’t you get me some toast?” 9*0 WESchutt A COMPLETE NOVELETTE) CHAPTER I. ON A LUCKY FLUKE. T was the third down, with three yards to gain. Wal- lace, Cornwall’s right end, shook the grogginess out of his reeling brain and tried to get to his position without staggering too much, and thus revealing to the State College quarter that he had had all flesh and blood could stand. It seemed to him that every play since the beginning of the last half had been di- rected at him; it seemed that half that incredible distance since the kick-off had been made around his end, either by straight rushes, or by trick plays that the others saw too late to back him up, when his sole hope was to wriggle through the interference, with no chance to tackle; when he could only cling to the man with the ball and feel himself dragged yards and yards until some one finally found the ball and stopped it. Wallace blamed himself for it. The fact that the State College backfield outweighed theirs so much was no miti- gation to his self-humiliation ; nor the fact that they had set out persistently to kill him oft by constant hammering. Dazed as he was, he could not believe that the Big Blue team was not back- ing him up properly, for to his mind the team could do nothing wrong. Of course, by this time he could not over- look the fact that something was amiss, but he held himself, and not the team, accountable for it. The Cornwall team was demoralized, utterly routed. State College had dum- founded them, left them stunned and gaping. This game with a supposedly minor team, the last one before the big game of the season, had been looked upon by Cornwall merely as a part of the schedule to be run through as a practice game in preparation for the crisis against Pittsville. And Cornwall had counted on annexing the Confer- ence Championship! Thus fat they had 78 TOP-NOTCH MAGAZINE met no defeat, had not even seen their goal line crossed. Ihey had started this game with practically all substi- tutes, in order to save their best men for the Pittsville game. Man by man, the varsity regulars had been sent in to save the game, until Wallace was the only sub left. For, in spite of State College being only a minor team, Cornwall had to save the game to win the champion- ship. One defeat, even by a minor team, would knock them out of it. Still the game was unsaved; and it almost seemed as if the Big Blue team grew more ragged as the regulars came in. It was an unaccountable slump from a championship to a third-rate team, and Wallace could see only himself to blame for it. Throughout the first half, he had held his own as well as and even better than could reasonably be expected of a man of his weight. That, however, was not the only reason why they left him in so long; or, at least, so he thought. The real reason was that “Slim” Gib- bons, regular varsity right end, simply must be kept in shape for the Pittsville game. Slim Gibbons-many of the men had changed his nickname to "Slime” in the past year-had to be coddled ; they could afford to take no risks on his playing against Pittsville. although there was always a question as to his litness. In his sophomore year, he had been a whirlwind; had been named unanimously as an all-varsity end. In his junior year he had lost out on the greater honor, but had played admir- ably for Cornwall in the bigger games. During this, his last year, his nocturnal habits had made his condition decidedlv shaky. But he had braced up. had shown unmistakable flashes of his old-time brilliance; so that, with the proper nursing and care, the varsity depended upon him to accomplish marvels against Pittsville. «At the sai^e time, every one understood that a hard game now was sure to put him out of condition for the Pittsville game; and Wallace knew quite well that they must not put Gibbons in at end except as a last des- perate resort. Moreover, Wallace knew that, preceding the last three plays, Captain Karlson had mutely signaled the coaches to put in Gibbons, to save those murderous attacks. From the coaches’ refusal, he gathered that the risk was too great, comprehended that he had to stick it out somehow because they banked on him to save Gibbons. The State College men crouched with grins on their faces. They could afford to grin. For, though the score was three to nothing against them, Cornwall had not made a score since the first two minutes of play; there were at least ten minutes more to play, the ball was theirs on Cornwall's fifteen-yard line, and Cornwall had been on the run dur- ing the last half, with holes every- where in their line. It was too easy for their quarter; any old signal was as good as any other, or had been since the intermission. It was just possible, however, that Cornwall would take a brace in the shadow of their own goal posts, and manage to knit the line to its old impregnable defense. As State Col- lege quarter’s eye roved over his op- ponents, he knew what play they ex- pected from the look on their tense faces. “Seven, thirty-two, six, twelve," he barked out, almost before his cen- ter had gripped the ball. State College’s signals thus far had been baffling. But Wallace, by pure de- duction. knew what was coming. State College was only eighteen yards to a touchdown, making five or ten yards at will. To Wallace, there could be no question as to what that signal meant. Their guards locked legs with their center to keep Cornwall out; their full back stepped back; their left end came out opposite Wallace tc pick him off, or so it looked. There was every in- ALL FOR THE GAME 79 dication of a drop kick for goal. Wal- lace knew that his own line would play for that-charge straight through in a forlorn hope of blocking the kick. He knew that he must kill their plav alone; for State College was not going to be satisfied with three points when they could as easily make it seven, with no appreciable risk. As the ball snapped back, Wallace leaped to the left and dodged the State College end, who was there to lay him low. He side-stepped their half as he started to lead the interference, and dodged out again, a little wide, to escape their other half. The full back, already starting with the ball on his fake-kick rush around right. saw Wallace through and charging him. He changed the ball to shove him off, and at that instant Wallace catapulted into him. The ball was down, at a loss of yards. No, not down, either; for then the miraculous happened. The full back lost the ball as he went down, insecure as it was from being suddenly changed. It bounced, bounced high from the very force with which Wallace tackled. Their right end, circling to complete the interference, scooped it up on the run, and went on ; and he, protected by the half backs whom Wallace had dodged and not picked off. ran the eighteen yards to a touchdown. There went the game, beyond possi- bility of dispute; on a fluke of the luckiest, to be sure, but the game nev- ertheless. True, they probably had the game sewed up, anyway; but this-this was rank treachery, a present of seven points to State College. Jeers and cat- calls came from the grand stands; a cry or two of “robber, robber!” But Wal- lace was past hearing these, so that it did not worry him whether the remarks were directed against him or against the State College end who had made the touchdown on the fluke. But Wallace, stunned at the incredi- ble result, half blinded by tears of rage and mortification, was not permitted to doubt what the disgruntled Cornwall team thought of his play. As they lined up on the goal line to receive the try- at-goal, Davis, the varsity tackle, said in an undertone: “You blind idiot, why didn’t you play wide and pick ’em off, instead of coming in?" “Playing it alone/’ panted Wallace; “had to get the man with the ball. How could I stop their whole interference?” “You’re playing too much alone/’ growled Davis. “If you’d play more for the team and less for the grand stand, these dubs wouldn’t run over us.” Wallace could not have replied, even if he had had the wind to talk. Com- pletely fagged out, choking with resent- ment at this unjust criticism-for Wal- lace knew he had played it right and that the varsity was wrong-his first word would probably have ended in a choking gasp. State College kicked the goal, of course. As Cornwall moved to the kick-off, Captain Karlson took matters into his own hands, and yelled to the side lines for Slim Gibbons. This sum- mons knocked out of Wallace’s head all thoughts of himself. The Pittsville game was more important, vastly more difficult, than this game. For weeks it had been drummed into them all that Cornwall could not win it without Slim Gibbons playing up to his old form. Slim must be saved for the Pittsville game. All this flashed through Wal- lace’s brain as one thought; fear of in- jury to Gibbons cleared his brain as a swift wind drives away fog. and pulled him together. He rushed to Captain Karlson. “Give me another chance, cap/' he begged. “Don’t put Slim in. He'll get hurt, sure as fate.” Karlson withered him with a glance. “Play without an end, eh?” he said, in a tone that can be imagined. “You get off the field.” 80 TOP-NOTCH MAGAZINE “But I'll come through yet,*' Wallace said. “I’ll hold 'em from now on. Two good runs by Moffatt, and '* “Off the field, Wallace!° Karlson commanded; and again he raised his voice and shouted for Gibbons. Back by the gate that led lo the club- house, out of earshot of the nervous, blanket-shrouded substitutes, the head coach and the end coach were holding a powwow. Presently the word was given. Slim shucked his blanket, danced up and down a few times to get his blood in motion, and ran out to his place, greeted by an echoing thunder of applause in the grand stands as the desperate rooters found new hope in the arrival of their old-time hero. “I’m going to get you for this, you simp/' Slim Gibbons said to Wallace as they passed on the edge of the field. “Maybe you think you can play foot- ball, but--” “Oh. Slim, play it safe/’ Wallace broke in. “If you get hurt, I'll-” “Aw. bunk!” Gibbons shot back at him. “Why didn’t you think of that sooner?” Wallace hurried on to hide his shame in the seclusion of the dressing room, though he was followed in closely by Hartigan, the end coach; and Harti- gan’s grizzled face, oddly enough, was beaming. CHAPTER II. FROM THE INSIDE. DEHIND the newspaper stand in the lobby of the Palace Hotel, Miss Heaton thrilled to the victory cheer that broke over the city like a storm from the Cornwall athletic field. Meager de- tails spread rapidly, that Cornwall had won by the score of ten to seven; that Slim Gibbons had come in at the last moment and saved the game with his first two plays. She paled a little at the mention of Gibbons, but every one in the semideserted lobby was too en- thusiastic at the moment to notice her; and she could not bring herself to ask any one what was of greater importance to her-what part Jimmy Wallace had in the game. It remained for her to learn this from the lips of a stranger. This stranger had been something of an enigma to her. He was a power- ful ly built, but rather debauched-look- ing, man of thirty or more, who had registered the night before as Theodore Paulsen, of Milwaukee. But his first demand upon her had been for the Phil- adelphia papers. Through her, he had bought the best seat to be had for the football game against State College, and, in paying for it, had flashed a roll of impressive size. He was the first man to enter the ho- tel after the football game, coming up to her with the easy familiarity which her position forced her to endure. “Philadelphia papers in yet, little sis- ter?” he asked. ‘‘Not until six o'clock, sir.” “Say,” he went on, “I ought to get half my money back for that grand- stand seat. Punkest exhibition of foot- ball I ever witnessed in all my evil life.” “I understand that Mr. Gibbons made some spectacular plays/’ Miss Heaton vouchsafed, with just sug- gestion enough to draw him out. “Sure; spectacular's right. Just two plays, only because State College was afraid of him at first. He ran down the kick-off, and ran on to a touch- down from blocking their kick. And then your great Gibbons shot his wad. He’s N. G.; he’s all in. Two fifty-yard runs was all he could stand. After that he didn’t play as good a game as you could’ve played yourself. If time hadn't been called just as it was, State College would’ve had seven more.” “He didn’t get hurt!” she exclaimed anxiously. “Hurt nothin’,” said Paulsen. “He’s done himself as a football player. Too much booze and night life. He can't ALL FOR THE GAME 81 stand the gaff any more. I know Gib- bons, and I know football. He's never played a game since he entered the varsity that I haven’t -seen." “But probably they can get him into shape for the Pittsville game,” Miss Heaton went on, still timid about ap- proaching directly the subject that most interested her. ‘'They’ll simply have to, I understand." “Don’t you think it, little sister," said Paulsen. ‘‘I know this game of foot- ball from A to Z and backward. Played myself, and coached. Take it from me, Charley Rourke don’t care a hang whether Slim Gibbons plays against Pittsville or not. They’ve un- earthed a new end that can play circles around anything Slim Gibbons ever had. This man Wallace has got the brains, I tell you. If he had the weight, he'd be a second Tom Shevlin-" “Wallace,” Miss Heaton interrupted, with a gasp, as if she could not be- lieve it. “Aha, little sister,” Paulsen re- marked. “Interested there, are yon ?” Miss Heaton said nothing, but she could not keep down a blush, even if she did make a pretense of rearrang- ing the newspapers; and Paulsen had as good an answer to his question as words would have been. “Well, little sister,” he said, ‘‘you can take it from me, that Wallace is the bright particular star of the Cornwall team this year. He played like a fiend this afternoon ; only man on the team who played anything like football. The rest of the bunch was outclassed, sore because they were licked from the start, and they took it out on him. I could see plain as day they were blaming him for their defeat. I was in a grand- stand seat right behind Charley Rourke and Hartigan when they were discuss- ing taking him out to save him for the Pittsville game. He’d had just about all he could stand. W allace had, play- ing for eleven men with his hundred 6B TN and forty pounds ; and then Cornwall got sore on him because State College got through on a fluke after he’d played it right.” “But-are you sure, Mr. Paulsen:” the girl asked, still incredulous. “They took him out, you say? You must be mistaken about his being so good.’’ “Listen ; I was tellin’ you,” Paulsen went on. “I heard the coaches-Char- ley Rourke and Hartigan-when they decided to call him off the field. So, it I don’t know this game well enough to judge, I overheard what they thought about him. They knew the rest of the team was sore on him; they knew he was light and had been playing for eleven men. So Hartigan, the end coach, tells Charley Rourke that they’d better take him out before he punishes himself too hard, because they wanted to save him for the Pittsville game; and they shoved Slim Gibbons into his place because Slim was rotten, anyway, and they didn’t much care what happened to him. Of course, Slim made a couple of big plays, but that’s all he’s good for. He wouldn't last more than two minutes in a real game, and Charley Rourke knows it by this time. It just happened that Slim made the winning touchdown, and Wallace was blamed for their fluky points; so Slims the popular hero again and Wallace is the dub. That’s what all the undergrads think now; but you can’t fool a pair of old-timers like Charley Rourk° and Hartigan-and me. So put that in your perfumed cigarette and smoke it, little sister.” “Some way,” Miss Heaton murmured doubtfully, “I can’t believe it yet. Mr. Wallace-and every one-has been telling me that Mr. Gibbons-” “I know; that's Wallace. He don’t half know how good he is; and that’s one reason why he plays such a crackajack of a game. Hartigan fol- lowed him into the dressing room just to ease the youngster’s mind and keep 82 TOP-NOTCH MAGAZINE him from brooding; but Hartigan won’t take any chances on spoiling him by telling him how good he is, so that’ll be up to you. I’ll bet you’ll tell him good and plenty, won’t you?’* Paulsen grinned knowingly at her. “I’d certainly like to,” said Miss Hea- ton; "but if it’s likely to spoil his game, I think I’ll deny myself the pleasure.” “Aw, take a chance on it, anyhow/’ suggested Paulsen, a little more seri- ously than he had spoken heretofore. “Say. it would make him worship the ground you walk on if you'd tell him all this. I know how I’d feel if 1 got an earful like that from a girl like you.” “There’s no danger of that,” said Miss Heaton coolly. Paulsen grinned at her and walked away. Miss Heaton looked after him a little curiously. What was he. anyway, this Mr. Paulsen? What was his inter- est in Wallace? It almost seemed as if he had wanted her to spoil Wallace’s game. CHAPTER III. TAKING NO CHANCES. OLIM GIBBONS, once more the worshiped hero of the undergradu- ate body, could not resist the tempta- tion to show himself in the grillroom again for a little while, and bask in the admiration of such boisterous students as frequented the hotel of nights. After dinner at the training table, he strolled down with one or two old cronies. He need not break training, of course; there would be no harm in a lemonade and a sandwich. And it was so long since he had received the homage of his fellows that he could not withstand the temptation. His entry into the noisy grillroom was the signal for a varsity yell that raised the roof; instantly he was set upon by half a dozen, raised to a throne atop of a table, and called upon for a speech; though, as always upon such occasions, the speech could not he heard for the shouting of the revelers. This public worship failed to please Gibbons as it had done in the past. Gibbons knew that it was his last court, and that he scarcely deserved even this one. He knew', in his own mind, that the death knell had rung upon his foot- ball career. Though he kept it to him- self, and did not think that any one else realized it. nevertheless he knew from the last few minutes of that game to-day that he was through. And even if he had not heard a smattering of that conclave between the coaches when he was sent out to supplant Wallace, nev- ertheless he knew the game well enough to understand that Wallace had far out- played him, that it was now Wallace, and no longer Slim Gibbons, who was to be coddled for the great Pittsville game. He hated Wallace for outplaying him, for robbing him of these sweet honors he was now receiving. That threat which he had muttered to Wal- lace as they passed on the field had been no idle one. Slim would have ruined Wallace if he could, out of sheer vengeance for a fancied wrong; but Slim could not figure out any way to do it so that his own hand would be concealed. From his table-top throne, through the smoke-laden atmosphere and over the heads of his roistering fellows. Slim suddenly saw a familiar face framed in the doorway, a huge figure that beck- oned a discreet summons. As soon as he could, Slim slipped down and worked his way to the door. " ’Lo, Carter, old scout,” he said. “What are you up to now ?” “ ’Lo, Slim. Saving you from sure destruction just now,” Paulsen re- turned jovially. “No place, that, for a varsity man, and you ought to know it.” “Shucks/’ returned Gibbons. "No ALL FOR THE GAME 83 harm done. Soft drinks and a sandwich and a yell or two-” “But the smoke and the beer fumes -say. come on up to my room a min- ute. now you're clear, and let's have a talk. I’m lonesome. Besides, that’s no place for you, and now you're clear of the bunch, you’d better stay clean” “All right; ten minutes with you. Then I’m going to hit the hay.” As the elevator let them out on Paul- sen’s floor. Gibbous repeated his ques- tion: “What you doing here, Carter? Spying for Pittsville?” “Sure; but nobody would guess it but you. Pittsville sent me up on the Q. T. to get a line on the game you fellows are playing. And say, go shy on that Carter stuff; I’m Paulsen here.*’ “Trust me. Everybody does it. Hot bunch you saw in action to-day.” “Bunch of prep-school freshmen-• all but Wallace. He shows you up for a clothin’-store dummy.” Paulsen shut his door behind them, motioned Gibbons to the one chair, and himself sat on the edge of the bed. He started to light a cigar, but re- frained out of deference to Gibbons and his training rules. “Come again. Carter,” said Slim. “Wallace is all right in a dinky game, but he wouldn’t be there against your bunch.” “He played circles around you,” said Paulsen calmly. “That’s because„I haven’t been in very good condition this season so far; not as much practice as I should have had. But I can do a lot in the ten days between now and your game.” "What are you fooling yourself for, Gibbons? You know, as well as I. that Charley Rourke has already decided to play Wallace, and not you, against us next Saturday week.” Gibbons grimaced, was about to remonstrate, saw the futility of it, and laughed uneasily. “It’d take a bigger man than I am to tell you anything about this game,” he admitted, with an ill-feigned air of jocularity. “How d’you feel about it. Slim r” asked Paulsen, with an unusually keen glance at Gibbons. “Bad, of course,” growled Slim. He waited a second for Paulsen to say something, and when Paulsen main- tained silence, Gibbons burst out with an impassioned invective like a pent- up torrent of hatred. “I tell you, it’s awful, Carter. Look at me. will you? All Conference end as a sophomore, lionized and worshiped by everybody that knew my face. You know about: it; you were there at that dinner after the game when I first made my rep; you know what the fellows did to me that night. Then, the next year, my game went off; I was just good, and that’s all. I managed to get into the big games, and won my C, but I was no better than any other end, and that was almighty hard for me. And then look at this year, my last year; why. Carter, the way it iooks now I won’t even make my C. Me, Slim Gibbons, the All Conference end two years ago. can’t even make my C in my last year unless I get into that Pittsville game. I tell you, it's horrible; when 1 think of it, I just about go mad with the shame and disgrace of it. I wish to the deuce I’d have broken an ankle, or even my fool back, in that game to-day, so I could have an alibi for not playing in the Pittsville game. Then it wouldn't have been so bad ; then the men could have said that Slim Gibbons would cer- tainly have made some of his old bril- liant plays if Wallace could have kept him from getting his leg broken. But as it is, what excuse can I offer? What other reason is there for not getting my C, except that I wasn’t good enough, except that Wallace, a little undersized. Sunday-school boy, who never played a decent game in his life, was better than I am. By Jove. Carter, sometimes it hits me so hard that I feel as if I could mur- TOP-NOTCH MAGAZINE der that little runt so he couldn’t play against you fellows, so Charley Rourkc would just have to stick me in and I could get my last letter.” Paulsen examined his nails, probably without seeing them. "There are plenty of ways,” he said softly, "short of mur- dering Wallace, to keep him out of that game.” “What do you mean?” demanded Gibbons, instantly bristling. "Just what I said,” returned Paulsen calmly. “What’s it to you, anyway?” “I’ve seen Wallace play; I’m not hankering to have him in against us any more than you are,” said Paulsen. “You’re batty, Paulsen !” (iibbons ex- claimed. “If he doesn't play, I would be at end myself; so where would you Pittsville people be any better off?” Paulsen passed a hand across his month as if he might be concealing a smile, although his face was quite grave as he replied: “We shan’t quarrel about that, Slim. It’s a matter of in- dividual opinion. At any rate, you don’t want Wallace in the game with Pittsville, in order that yofr can ha\e his place; and we don’t want him play- ing against us, for no matter what rea- son. Between us, we might figure out a little scheme-still, Gibbons, I don't want to have the appearance of sug- gesting anything against the interests of your team,” he added craftily. Gibbons spoke up quickly: “If it were really against the interests of Cornwall, I wouldn’t listen to it. But 1 know I can play as good a game as he, if not a better game, once I get fit. So come across with your little scheme.” “You’re in too much of a hurry.” Paulsen smiled back at him. “The thing only just occurred to me. I haven’t had time to figure it out well enough yet; and you know as well as I do that no rough stuff is going to get past Wallace and Charley Rourkc. Whatever it is lias got to be pretty clever.” “That’s right enough,” admitted Gib- bons, plainly disappointed. ‘Can I bank on you for a little help, in case I need you?’1 ‘Not if any one’s going to get wise to my part in it,” replied Gibbons promptly and emphatically. Again Paulsen passed his great hand across his lips, and again his face was grave as he spoke: “I’ll protect you, right enough. No one can get wise to your part in it. as you’ll see for your- self when I tell you what I want you to do. Fact is, the way I see it now, I may not want you to do anything; but if 1 should need you, it’ll be the sim- plest thing imaginable." “What is it ?” “I tell you. I’ve got to think it out carefully. It’ll require a lot of figuring. Time you were in bed, if you’re in training at all. I’ll work it all out to- night, and drop you a special-delivery letter in the morning about it. I sup- pose you’ll have sense enough to de- stroy the letter.” "I’m not going to take any chances.” ”1 thought not,” said Paulsen, rising. "You’ll have a letter from me to-mor- row morning. I’m pulling out of here on the first train. But I’ll be back the night before the Pittsville game, and you can get a chance to drop me a quiet word as to what you think about it.” “I know beforehand what I think about it,” declared Gibbons, with a grin, "if it’ll get Wallace out of the game without putting me in bad.” “That's exactly what it will do.” Paulsen said, and walked to the door to let Gibbons out. CHAPTER IV. ALL SEALED UP. AN the night before the Pittsville game, which was to be played this year on the Cornwall field, Paulsen registered again at the hotel. He smiled graciously at Miss Heaton as he passed her newspaper stand in the lobby, and ALL FOR THE GAME 85 went straight to his room. His first act was to telephone Slim Gibbons at his fraternity house, giving the noncom- mittal name of Jones. But when Gib- bons came to the phone, he introduced the subject in such a way that Gibbons must know who was speaking. “Did you get my letter a week ago Sunday morning?” he asked. “Oh, this is you, eh ?” said Gibbons cordially. ‘‘Sure I got it.” “What do you think of the idea?” “Finest young scheme ever hatched,” replied Gibbons. “And I can bank on you to put it through ?” “You certainly can ; only you won’t need any help from me. He won’t last the first four plays at that rate.” “Sh-h,” Paulsen warned him; “this is over the telephone!” Gibbons took the tip and hung up. Paulsen went down to the hotel lobby, found it practically deserted, and took occasion to renew his acquaintance with Miss Heaton. “How’s Wallace?” he asked her teasingly. “Frightened to death he can’t make good in Mr. Gibbons’ place.” she said. “Really, I feel very sorry for him-his first big game, and all that, with Mr. Gibbons’ reputation to uphold, and the whole varsity censuring the coaches for putting him in the place of Gibbons.” “1 know just how he must feel,” Paulsen said, summoning to his aid a tender note of sympathy. “I’ve been there myself. I’m a Cornwall man; used to play quarter years and years ago.” “Really?” She looked at him with a new light of admiration in her eyes. “Really,” Paulsen declared. “Ask any old-timer. I’m pulling hard for Cornwall to-day, and if Wallace doesn’t play up to form, we’re going to be licked-everlastingly swamped. And say, if you feel as sorry for Wallace as you say you do, why don’t you buckle in and help him out a little?” “But how can I help him? What can I do?” Paulsen looked round the lobby and saw that no one was within earshot. “Know anything about this game of football?” he asked her finally. “Of course I do. I know as much about it as any one can who has never played. I see every big game; I shall be there to-morrow.” “Then you know what signals are?” “Certainly 1 do. I’ve worked them out lots of times for fun.” “Then listen sharp, little sister. It cost me considerable money and more trouble, but I’m a loyal Cornwall man and I'd give a year’s salary any old time to see the old varsity lick Pitt; so I don’t begrudge what I’ve done. Fact is, I’ve”-here he leaned far over the newspaper counter, and whispered -“I’ve got the signals Pittsville’s going to play with to-morrow’. I bribed the janitor of their clubhouse to let me in- stall a dictograph in their blackboard room when the coach gave out their signals, and I’ve got every blessed one of them.” “Gracious!” gasped Miss Heaton. “Exactly,” Paulson hurried on. “But now I’ve got ’em, I don’t hardly know how to pass ’em on without revealing myself. See the point? If I go ahead and give 'em straight out to Captain Karlson, or to Charley Rourke, it’s sure to get back to Pittsville how I got hold of ’em, and I don’t want to get that poor janitor in trouble. So I thought' maybe you’d take the job off my hands. It’ll help me and the varsity, and, above all, it’ll help Wallace. All you’ve got to do is to hand him this, and tell him that a friend got hold of the sig- nals and wanted him to have 'em. But, above all, don’t mention my name. Are you game, little sister?” “But it seems so perfectly incredible that you actually have got their sig- nals,” she said, a peculiar light in her eyes. 86 TOP-NOTCH MAGAZINE He laughed jovially. “A man can do anything when he’s got money enough and motive enough. I’ve got both; I’d rather see old Cornwall trample on Pittsville to-morrow than inherit a mil- lion dollars. That’s why I’m doing this. Hut all the same, I don’t want my name known. Of course, if you don't want Wallace to have the benefit of them, when you know how much they will help him, I shall figure out another way of giving them to the team.” “Oh, but I do want to help him,” she said, instantly putting out her hand. “Please give them to me.” Paulsen beamed upon her. “That’s the kind of a girl I thought you were. I ought to claim a little personal re- ward for this favor I’m doing you, but -but I’ll leave Wallace to claim that. Here they are, little sister, all sealed up in this envelope. Wallace ought to be eternally good to you for this.” The envelope changcd hands, and Paulson hurried away. Miss Heaton’s eyes narrowed as she watched him go. "Friend of Slim Gibbons, eh?” she said to herself, as she thrust the envelope into the back of her cash drawer. CHAPTER V. AT THEIR FINGER TITS. 'Y'HE first half of the great game ended with a goose egg apiece. But toward the last of it the Cornwall team had been on the run, with the ball far in their territory most of the time. 1 hey had recovered from their shock- ing slump against State College, and although their offense was mediocre, nevertheless their defensive game, espe- cially when they were in the shadow of their own goal posts, was of champion- ship caliber, owing principally to the play of Jimmy Wallace, His football instinct, his nose for the ball and for trick plays, was something uncanny. Time after time, he dived through and stopped the ball with a loss, until finally Pittsville confined it- self to line rushing. The rest of the men seemed tacitly to acknowledge his leadership in defense, followed him, backed him up admirably. For the first three or four minutes of play, the Pittsville quarter back seemed to watch Wallace with more than ordinary intentness; and, after plays, there crept into his eyes an ex- pression of bafflement, as if things were not happening which he expected to happen. It took him iust about four minutes to realize that that which he had expected was not going to materi- alize; and thereafter he played as if he had expected nothing. But Slim Gibbons, waiting under his blanket on the side lines, could not so easily readjust himself. He had ex- pected that Wallace would be hauled out of the game, thanks to Paulsen’s clever scheme, before he had been in six plays; and here Wallace was play- ing straight through the first and sec« ond periods, playing a star game, far and away the best of the Cornwall men, amply vindicating Charley Rourke’s choice of him at right end, amply prov- ing his superiority to Slim Gibbons. Gibbons nervously bit his nails and bottled up the flood of his jealous rage against Wallace, bracing himself for the final stroke of the joint campaign against W'allace. After digesting Paul- sen’s letter to him. Slim had been cer- tain that he himself would not be called upon to take any part. But the unex- pected had happened. Now he must make his play. Slim preceded the team into the dressing room and awaited his oppor- tunity. The head coach could not have given him a belter opening than that which cropped out in the coach’s usual vitriolic comment to the team upon their play in the first half. "They’re going to smash you fellows eternally now,” he said quietly. "They’ve got you on the run now; you ALL FOR THE GAME 87 couldn’t score on 'em if they let you have the ball all the time. Best you can do is to hold ’em. Make it a tie with this bunch and I’ll be satisfied. You’re all doing as well as could be expected from a prep-school team, and that's about all you amount to this year. You know that as well as I do. Wallace is the only man playing anything near varsity style. I give you credit for one thing-you’re wise enough to fol- low him and back him up. That’s all.” This was Gibbons’ opportunity. “No wonder Wallace can play a star game!” he burst out vehemently. “He’s got their signals. He knows every play be- fore it starts. No wonder he can stop the bail for a loss every other play.” Gibbons’ startling announcement was greeted only by a desultory laugh of de- rision from one or two of the fagged- out men. The possession of their op- ponents’ signals was a charge so mani- festly absurd that they didn’t even take the trouble to consider it seriously. ‘‘You couldn’t have made the team, Slim, even if you did have ’em,” the burly right guard jibed him. “Laugh all you want to,” Gibbons re- torted angrily. “It’s straight goods. I know it for a fact; I’ve got a straight tip. Look at him, will you? See how he’s squirming, and see if you don’t be- lieve me.” As a matter of fact, the charge had hit Wallace rather hard ; and keyed up as he was, he could not have dissembled if he had wanted to. Moreover, Char- ley Rourke had watched him rather keenly while the others were laughing at Gibbons; and the head coach was convinced that there was something in this charge. “What about this, Wal- lace?” he demanded, in no gentle tone. “Have you got hold of their signals?” "Just what do you mean by that?” Wallace asked. “Exactly what I say. Do you know their signals?” The head coach was thundering now. “No. Charley, I certainly do not know their signals,” Wallace replied. “He lies!” shouted Slim Gibbons. “He's got ’em, and I know it.” By this time every one of the twenty- odd men in the room was sitting up- right and staring from Gibbons to Wal- .lace. “No wonder he can play a star game,” sneered Davis, the right tackle, w'ho had never liked Wallace since the State College game. “Who couldn’t, with the opponents’ signals?” “Slim, what do you know about this?” asked Charley Rourke. “You’ve been talkin’ a lot and not sayin’ much so far. If you’ve got anything to say, come out and say it. Where’d you get your tip?” “Bell boy in the hotel told me that a Pittsville man gave ’em to Millv Hea- ton; and if she got hold of ’em, you know which one of us would get ’em from her, don’t you?” Gibbons asked, with fine sarcasm. “You leave her out of this, Gibbons,” Wallace shot at him. “What passes between us is nobody’s business but ours.” “Did she give you the signals. Wal- lace?” asked Charley Rourke. “Answer yes or no, or I’ll kick you off the team for the rest of the game.” “She gave me an envelope in which she said were the signals. I don’t know anything about it; I didn’t even look at em. “That’s a beaut of a tale to stuff us with!” cried Davis. “I see you or anv one else having the signals and not studying ’em up.” “Got ’em with you now. Wallace?” demanded Rourke. “I should say that was my affair. She gave them to me; the man who gave them to her said the}* were for me. I took them, not to hurt any one’s feel- ings. But I’ve never looked at them from that minute to this. If I play football, I’ll play the game right.” “Hand ’em over, Wallace!” com- 88 TOP-NOTCII MAGAZINE manded Charley Rourke. His voice was trembling- with rage and excitement. For him, it meant the renewal or re- fusal of his coaching contract, whether Cornwall defeated their great rivals that day. Till now, he had foreseen defeat, or a tie at best; and had braced himself to meet it. But now that he saw sure victory in their grasp, with the possession of Pittsville’s baffling sig- nals, he was as a man beside himself; he forgot everything except what it meant to him for the Cornwall team to have the signals, and he would have taken them from Wallace by sheer physical force, if he had to. “What do you want with them, Char- ley ?” countered Wallace. ‘‘To light his cigar with, of course.” said Davis ironically. “Come across with the signals, and see if some of the rest of us can’t play a star game, too,” said another. “I make a move,” said a third, “that we get the whole varsity to boycott Milly Heaton for playing a favorite like that; and where’d she be if the varsity didn’t buy from her?” There was truth in this. Without the trade of the varsity men, Milly’s sales would fall about nine-tenths. Wallace could not be stubborn in the face of that threat. “She didn’t mean any par- tiality by giving them to me,” he spoke up. “She told me to do what I wanted to with them. She gave them to me merely because she happened to know me better than she does any of the rest of you.” “If that's true,” growled Rourke, “come across with the signals. And if you are lying about that, keep your sig- nals. But I won’t have any man on the team who hogs every advantage so he himself can play a grand-stand game, and leave his team in the lurch. Take your choice, and take it quick, Wallace.” If he had had only himself to con- sider, Wallace would probably still have withheld that sealed envelope. But he perceived at once how costly it might be for Milly Heaton. He turned 011 Rourke wrath fully, and through him addressed every man in the room. “I’m sick and ashamed of the whole bunch of you,” he said. “If you call it playing football to have the other side’s signals in a dishonest way, then take them and much good may they do you. Here they are, in a sealed en- velope just as 1 got them. And if yon study them, and take advantage of them, I’ll quit the game right here. If 1 play football, I’ll play the game to the end; and this is the end of the game. I shan’t show myself on the field for the next half if you go out there with those signals at your finger tips. Now you take your choice.” Wallace strode to his locker, fumbled with his coat, took the sealed envelope, and shied it across the room to the head coach ; and Rourke ripped it open with unconcealed eagerness and obvious pur- pose. “I reckon Slim can put up as good a game at end as you,” said Davis, “now that he's got the signals.” "All right, then,” said Wallace more quietly, watching Rourke’s eager eyes take in the signals. “I might as well change my clothes right now.” Thus Slim Gibbons got his oppor- tunity in the Pittsville game. But to look at him, one could not have guessed that he had finally realized the ambi- tion of a year past; one might almost have judged that he was awaiting the hangman, or worse. For suddenly it dawned upon him how ingeniously Paulsen had entrapped him and the whole team. But Gibbons said nothing, for ex- planation would be a confession of his own guilt, and he had to protect him- self. No one noticed his queer appear- ance, for no one had eyes or mind for anything but the signals. Thus the Cornwall team went to the second half, ALL FOR THE GAME 89 eager, confident, anxious for the one- sided battle in which they would know beforehand their opponent’s every move. Wallace, left behind by his own choice, delayed changing to street clothes long enough to see the game start again, to see Slim Gibbons charge down the field under the kick-off, to hear the deafening applause from the grand stands as the popular hero beat the ball, threw the Pittsville man in his tracks, and made it first down on Pitts- ville’s fifteen-yard line. Wallace could even fancy that he heard a vast, con- certed sigh of relief as the packed grand stand settled back, much as if each man of the multitude were saying to himself or to a neighbor: “Thank heavens, Slim’s in the game. Now we’ll see something doing.” And the grand stand did see some- thing doing, but not Wallace; for he hurried back to change his clothes and join Milly Heaton in the bleachers. CHAPTER VI. SOME QUESTIONS ANSWERED. \\7ITH an imprecation that would have made Captain Kidd blush, Charley Rourke burst in upon Wallace as he was unlacing his shoes. From the labyrinth of epithet, Wallace finally gathered that the head coach was charging him with some heinous crime. “I don’t quite get you, Charley/’ said Wallace, looking up calmly. ‘‘What’s the fuss about?” “WhatVe you done to those signals?” Rourke thundered. “Nothing. I've never even looked at them. Why?” “Why? Why?” Rourke bellowed, standing over Wallace and trembling with rage. “You double-dyed, blank- ety-blank traitor, you’ve done us up, you’ve smeared us, you’ve robbed us of the game.” “What happened?” Wallace was finally becoming curious. “Touchdown. They’ve got a touch- down from their first play! That’s all that’s happened. It’ll be one a minute from now on.” “How’s that? Can’t the bunch stop them if they know beforehand-” “Aw, dry up. You did it on purpose. You had it in for us, and faked the signals.” “Tell me what happened,” Wallace requested once more. “According to the signals you gave us,” snarled Rourke, “their quarter called for a forward pass from kick formation. Everybody played for their ends; and their quarter went through between tackle and guard, and ran the length of the field for a touchdown be- fore any one knew where the ball was.” “Well,” said Wallace indifferently, “if your bunch hadn't crammed the sig- nals, theyM have watched the ball and stopped ’em. What d'you come squeal- ing to me for? You know the kind of football you want to play ; go ahead and play it.” Wallace took off a shoe and threw it contemptuously into his locker. He couldn’t understand the sit- uation, and didn’t try to; he had wiped his hands of the whole business when he passed over the signals. “You’ll be lynched when this game is over!” cried Rourke. “How so? WhatVe I got to do with it?” “You faked the signals. You did it purposely to show us up.” “I tell you I never even looked at the signals. I gave them to you just as I got them. When would I have time to fake the signals? Are they in my handwriting?" “Is that straight goods, Wallace?’* demanded Rourke, beginning to be con- vinced by Wallace's demeanor. “You can prove it by Miss Heaton if you want to. She’ll know the hand- writing on the envelope I gave you; and you know yourself that envelope was sealed when you got it.” 90	TOP-NOTCH Hartigan, the end coach, burst in with a groan. "Three points more for the robbers,” he announced. “They sig- naled left half through left guard. Quarter dropped hack and booted her over clean as a whistle while our bunch backed up the guard." Kotirke swore, “What are we going to do about it ?’* “The hunch is getting wise. Karl- 'on’s called for time and is talkin’ to ’em. They'll probably forget the sig- nals and play a straight game from now on. Hut ten to nothing-what can they do? Say, Wallace, you'd better make yourself scarce around here; if that hunch once gets hold of you-” "I think I'll stay/' said Wallace. "Maybe you’ll be wanting to put me in at end the beginning of next period.” He reached for his shoe and began to readjust it. Charley Rourke’s sudden anger beat itself out against Wallace’s coolness; perceiving that anger netted him nothing, he got himself under restraint. "What’s the history of that envelope?” he asked. “Where did Milly Heaton get it?” "She told me that an old Cornwall man gave it to her to be passed on to a member of our team. She knows me better than she does any of the others, and so-” "Who was it?" Rourke interrupted. "What was his name?” "She didn’t want to tell, and I didn’t press the point. I wasn’t particularly interested in the signals. T preferred to play without knowing them." Rourke winced a little. "What sort of looking man was he?” he asked. “I didn't ask anything about him. I merely took the envelope she gave me because she wanted me to, and stuck it in my pocket, and forgot it.” “Do you know where 1 can get hold of her? Somebody’s playing us for simps, and I want to find out who it is.” MAGAZINE “She’s in section No. 8, first row. If you want to talk with her, I’ll take you to her. Come along.” Rourke and Hartigan followed Wal- lace out. and along the boarding in front of the bleachers until they came to where Milly sat. The teams had lined up again for a scrimmage, but neither of the coaches looked at them now. "Whatever’s happening out there?” cried Miss Heaton despairingly, as soon as the three stopped before her. "Why did you take Mr. Wallace out?” she asked, turning directly to the head coach. "Because lie refused to play/' said Rourke grimly. "A little question of that envelope you gave him. Some- body’s been faking us, and we want to know who. How did you get hold of it, Miss Heaton ?” Milly went white. "Somebody's fak- ing you/’ she repealed, visibly alarmed, and looking at Wallace with an inde- scribable expression. "How so?” Wallace told her briefly how he had been forced to give up the signals to ihe team. "The question is.” Rourke spoke up before she could talk, "who is the man who gave you those signals? If you don’t know his name, describe him to > me and-and its those fake signals she said that gave pittsville those ten points just now it certainly is said rourkc they wouldnt have given pittsville the ten points wallace corrected him dryly if you hadnt studied them dont rub it in wallace rourke requested him and prompted miss heaton to answer hi question its my fault she said in a voice that choked i-i faked the signals myself i gave mr wallace the wrong envelope you-you what rourke asked and wallace could only stare all for the game  i-i never thought it would work out this way she stammered i-i did it only to-because i was afraid that- what raged rourke why did you do it why did you change the signals and give the wrong ones to wallace  although he was completely baffled by the mystery wallace was deeply moved by sympathy for the girl see- ing how she writhed under the lash of rourkes angry tongue dont worry too much about it milly he spoke up its as much their fault as it is yours if they had left those signals alone as they should have done- oh all right wallace rourke growled i grant that but lets get to the bottom of this what about it miss heaton she was calmer now the truth is i suspected the man who gave them to me because i knew he was a friend of slim gibbons i saw them together the night after the state college game mr gibbons went up to his room and stayed there half an hour and i hap- pen to know that mr gibbons hasnt any love for mr wallace so as i say i suspected some trick or other that would get mr wallace in bad this man paulsens story sounded too extravagant besides i think hes a pittsville man at heart because he always asked for the philadelphia pa- pers and i didnt want to worry mr wallace by telling him that he might expect treachery on his own team so i simply solved the problem by substi- tuting another sheet of paper for the one the man paulsen had given me i wrote down an old set of signals so that in case mr wallace did look at them which i didnt think he would there would be no chance of their get- ting him in wrong then why have given them to me at all  wallace asked so paulsen would think his plan had succeeded and not try another one where is the original envelope r rourke asked in a queer tone i have it here she said reaching into the pocket of her heavy coat i was going to give it to mr wallace after the game and explain things rourke took it grimly well miss heaton youve managed to knock us out of a victory to-day you certainly gummed things up for the cornwall team excuse me rourke but i must ob- ject to that statement wallace said if you hadnt- but its not too late yet is it milly asked if you would put mr wallace in again- he couldnt go in again anyway now weve taken him out until the end of this period rourke said but theres hope yet she returned the cornwall men seem to be holding them now pittsville is only ten points ahead if they can stick it out until the end of the period- this drew their attention to the game again cornwall had discovered the deception they could not fail to do so after the first three or four plays they had forgotten the signals which they had crammed during the intermis- sion and were playing straight foot- ball  and although they were far down in their own territory they seemed to be making a stand wallace refused once to play rourke reminded the girl that was because i thought we had the real signals said wallace now theyre playing football again ill go out if you want me to miss heaton spoke up impulsively with a stifled sob in her voice i wish that you could half imagine how i feel about this in spite of what you say its my fault if cornwall is defeated and i should never dare look any one in the face again   top-notch magazine wallace comprehended as his eyes met hers squarely that she was making a direct appeal to him quite as if she were confident that he could go into the game in the last period and over- come that big lead that pittsville had piled up it cant be done he said as to him- self half unconsciously and regretting instantly what he had said turned quickly away so that he might not see the pain in her eyes for he knew more than any one what it meant to her to see cornwall defeated now chapter vii right down to facts joing in for the last period wal- lace feared that the team in the belief that he had purposely faked the signals would be against him to a man but gibbons was worse than useless to- ward the end of the third period so that the team fighting desperately to hold their opponents and forgetting for the moment personal animosities in the battle welcomed any one who could bolster up the end and save them from an overwhelming score against them the period started with cornwall in possession of the ball on their fifteen- yard line fourth down and six to gain they elected to kick of course the kick badly judged and carried by a side wind went out of bounds in mid- field there followed an exchange of kicks which ended by wallaces recov- ering the ball on a muff on pittsvilles twenty-yard line directly in front of the goal in the next play cosgrove cornwalls full back had booted it over for three points easy as his own part was cosgrove got the credit for it in the cheers that greeted the play the spectators were down on wallace from the start for having displaced their fa- vorite  and no one took note of the fact that it was wallace who had made the play a certainty afraid to try again their kicking tac- tics with wallace fresh again and fast as a sprinter pittsville took to straight football and for the next ten min- utes hammered the cornwall line from tackle to tackle shoving them down time and again to the shadow of their goal posts only to be held there with a defense that became impregnable in the critical moment then wih the time short and the game sewed up by a lead of seven points they abandoned offensive tactics and held to their ad- vantage the ball was given to cornwall on their own twenty-yard line cosgrove was thrown for a loss on a straight buck  quarter tried a delayed pass and netted three yards then called for a fake forward pass to wallace wal- lace got clear and signaled for the ball but cosgrove wouldnt change his mind carried it through and gained a yard wallace ran down the kick that fol- lowed and held the runner to a ten-yard gain playing still defensive pittsville kicked on their first down cornwalls quarter blocked it and recovered the ball and then the same tactics con- tinued as before give me a chance sandy wallace panted to the quarter as they untangled themselves from the first scrimmage it was second down eight to gain on pittsvilles forty-yard line and not over two minutes to play aw whats the use returned the quarter wearily and aloud as if he didnt care what the pittsville men heard you robbed us of the game in the first place so why get excited about it now just one chance begged wallace almost choking with despair for now he realized what the spirit of the team was oh all right returned the quarter in disgust anything goes now he signaled wallace around the opposite end taking no pains to conceal the fact all for the game  for now that the situation was hope- less he didnt seem to care much what happened the pittsville team with ample warning of the fact moved over to kill the play as soon as it was started  for this play was too simple but in their eager confidence they had be- trayed their defense play a fraction of a second too soon and wallace took ad- vantage of it instead of tearing on after his interference when he had taken the ball he turned back with the lightninglike twist that only his small size made possible and while pittsville to a man was wrecking the useless interference wallace dodged back around his own end with the field to the goal quite clear except for their hovering full back he caught off his guard was no match for the slippery little end and within five seconds the grand stands were echoing to a thunder of cheers for the touchdown while the disgruntled pittsville team were still looking for the ball wallace still hugging the ball in a sort of grateful frenzy behind pitts- villes goal line thrilled excusably to this belated but no less wonderful recognition of him no matter what had gone before he felt himself vindi- cated true cornwall could not win for the whistle was even then piping for time but they needed only one point to tie and in the circumstances a tie was almost as good as a victory and cosgrove could scarcely fail to make that one point by kicking the goal wallace held the ball for the try shut his eyes and clinched his teeth as cos- graves foot swished past his head then he heard a second impact which in the deep hush that marks a tense and breathless multitude resounded like a gunshot he forced himself to open his eyes and look the ball hit the upright hovered for a sickening moment and bounded back into the field thus cornwall went down to defeat by a score of ten to nine and the sour looks of his teammates told wallace whom they held accountable for their defeat defeated as they were they couldnt even give him credit for the points he had won they could think of nothing but the faked-up signals they looked upon him as a pariah as one to be shunned and detested wallace strode on to the gate look- ing neither to right nor to left his head down seeing nothing and hearing nothing-nothing at least until he passed the place where miss heaton sat she called to him her voice sharp with command he crossed over to speak - with her im awfully sorry- he began though he did not avoid her eyes they hate you she said the think youre to blame for the defeat its wrong of them her hands clenched and her eyes were bright with tears they cant even give you credit for what rou did let em think what they want to wallace said but i shant let them think that she protested im going to tell them the truth i dont care what it costs me they must respect you they sim- ply must give you the credit- cap- tain karlson come here a moment please she lifted her clear voice more in entreaty this time than in command karlson leaving the field at the head of his team looked sharply from wal- lace to miss heaton hesitated a mo- ment and then came over i want to tell you said the girl as if she were in a great hurry to get the disagreeable confession over and done with i want to tell you that it was i who faked those signals it was i and not mr wallace you have no right to blame him- hold on there a minute charley top-notch magazine rourkes heavy voice broke in as he came running from the gate the team to a man came up closer and gathered about karlson while rourke spoke the whole business comes right back to slim gibbons he said to them all  suspected him after i got more facts and made him con- fess when i hauled him out of the game whatd he got to do with it  karl- son growled trick of his to get wallace hauled out of the game earlier made it up with carter the old pittsville man who posed to miss heaton as paulsen and a cornwall man rourke explained but how could carter and gibbons get wallace out of it davis asked with a sour glance at wallace cinch wallace was to have the signals and study them up no one else was to have them carter worked out a set with the pittsville quarter so that wallace couldnt get wise too soon not till hed been drawn in wrong after the first six or eight plays and made a fool of himself so consistently that id have to pull him out of the game then gibbons was going in and get his letter for to-days game then why didnt it work out that way queried karlson much as if he did not yet believe it simply because wallace was man enough not to look at the signals car- ter-or paulsen-suspected that he might not and that led him up to the bigger game that gibbons didnt even suspect carter was out for a pittsville victory he feared that signals or no signals wallace might defeat pittsville his sole object was to get wallace out of the game carter did not consider gibbons at all dangerous gibbons charged you with having the signals and all he expected then was that td pull you out for unfair play but car- ter figured it out exactly as it hap- pened that youd have to turn the sig- nals over to us and so he would get us all instead of wallace alone car- ters signals were fakes just as much as those miss heaton substituted karlson turned to rourke his big face livid in spite of his fatigue do you mean to say charley that slim gibbons sat by saw us cramming those fake signals knew they were faked and let us do it he certainly did said he was afraid to confess and took a chance where is he davis growled say he wont last long- hold your horses davis rourke put in hes not much worse than we are when you come right down to it besides hes cleared out scared to death of what youll do to him i think slim gibbons has left this vicinity for good said he was going to he had better said davis truc- ulently fact is rourke went on wallace here is the only man in the bunch and that includes me i admit it and if you men amount to anything youll admit it too a little abashed the men looked at wallace who stood with his back to the boarding his arms folded indif- ferently then as with one accord they gathered round him and lifted their voices in three hearty cheers the hard defiant expression left wallaces face he felt a light touch on his shoulder and turned to see miss heaton smiling at him speechless with emotion but with shining eyes then karlson and davis tore him away set him on their shoulders and started for the clubhouse with the team and the substitutes surging about them from this post of honor wallace looked back and saw miss heaton on her feet waving at him he turned away quickly and blinked his eyes it certainly was fine of her he said to himself as they passed through the gate alwaystfiere

trouble makes the whole world kin widmer grinned his eyes suddenly lighting i wonder now if the don wouldnt appreciate a little assistance unmindful of his personal appear- ance he turned and started toward the house as he approached he saw that the automobile held a man and woman both of whom had now alighted the man being strenuously engaged in cranking the machine just before widmer arrived upon the scene the solution to the trouble was discovered the man looked into the gasoline tank and found that it was empty bah he exclaimed from the girl beside him-for she was little more than a girl-widmer caught a distinct titter the next moment he had joined them ill give you a hand sir and well run her in he suggested pleas- antly in spanish the two turned upon him simulta- neously surprise their dominant emo- tion for they had not noticed him ap- proaching at first meeting widmer felt no particular liking for the man he was about fifty years of age small wiry with a vandyke beard and alert beady eyes it was those eyes that prompted widmers aversion for they held a certain shifty light that he had encountered before and knew how to interpret but the girl surely she must have been the belle of guatemala she was not more than eighteen a dark beautiful creature with a wealth of blue-black hair a full white throat and softly glowing eyes widmer who had seen no woman of any sort for weeks stepped behind the car in con- fusion suddenly and supremely con- scious of his unconventional appear- ance his embarrassment was relieved by the voice of the girls companion i thank you senor i shall be very glad to have your assistance he joined widmer at the rear and together they pushed the antiquated vehicle through the gate and up the smooth pebbled drive there the little man straight- ened himself gave a twirl to his long black mustache and gazed upon wid- mer with a peculiar searching expres- sion i thank you sehor and now allow me to introduce myself i am miguel carrajos a tobacco planter this is the sefiorita teresa barrasca my niece and you senor i take it are an american  the next instant he gave a start of surprise for widmers attitude sud- denly underwent a most astonishing change he drew himself up to his full height his eyes flashing ameri- can  he repeated quickly is every man who is born and bred in the united states an american call me wid- mer if you please and let it go at that there was an instant of strained and awkward silence the man and girl started at him astonished as much by his words as by his sudden exhibition of temper but while the girls eyes expressed only a vague wonder the mans held a keener knowing light after his first shock of surprise he glanced at the stranger with a new in- terest beneath widmers vagabond

therefore if you will go to live in this house what food and clothing you desire shall be yours you shall be supplied with horses and a carriage and you shall receive at the end of a month one hundred pesos is it not a fair proposition  fair for a moment widmer was too taken aback to reply he had to look hard at the man to make sure that he was not jesting but the eyes of the little guatemalan held anything but humor in fact they sparkled with a most avaricious light a light that in any other circumstances would have caused widmers previous suspicions to strengthen but he was too excited to notice such things now besides the material benefits he would gain by this offer he was thinking of the girl the prospect of meeting that radiant crea- ture on her own social level was too great to be ignored he stepped forward quickly his heart pounding and held out his hand done he said i dont know whose side the favor is on and i dont care ill accept the proposition at its face value chapter ii

pretentious as that of his host was one of the finest in champerico it stood on the crest of a hill overlooking sea and town and save for the element of loneliness came fully up to his expectations he found himself possessed of more good clothes than he could wear a larder supplied with the choicest of wines and food and a handsome barouche and spanking team of bays truly senor carrajos had carried out his promise to the let- ter in return for all this widmer had to do nothing but pose as a gentleman of means and claim that the property was under his protection protection indeed it was not likely that the sol- diers would have injured the building itself and beyond the furnishings that senor carrajos had given him from his own house he could discover nothing that required protection save six large cases of tobacco in the cellar again and again did he rack his brains for a motive for the planters action for that there was a motive behind it all he was confident senor carrajos did not look to him like a man who did things with- out a reason but the more he pon- dered the more puzzled he became until finally deciding that this was no con- cern of his anyway he gave up guess- ing and proceeded to enjoy his good fortune widmer did this in the most ap- proved fashion when he was not din- ing or driving he was sitting upon his shaded veranda a cigar between his lips and a sparkling glass at his side gaz- ing down upon the sea and town be- low one day while he was thus en- gaged he was attracted by a cloud of smoke on the southern horizon watch- ing it intently he made it out to be a united states gunboat several of which since the revolution in mexico had been ordered to patrol the central american coast line immediately his attitude changed he sprang erect  top-notch magazine and menaced the oncoming vessel with his fist thai for you he said his eyes alight with a fierce exultation ive kotowed to you for the last time you big conceited bully im a citizen of the world now no matter how much widmer might be enjoying himself up there on the hill however he could never quite get his thoughts away from the broad rambling ranch house below a pair of black glowing eyes and scarlet lips haunted him through the day and night now that the girl and himself were on a common plane he forgot his pre- vious embarrassment andbecame ob- sessed by an insatiable longing to be with her one day a week after his arrival being unable to endure the sus- pense any longer he attired himself in a suit of neat-fitting flannels or- dered out his barouche and started boldly for the planters residence as he drew near he caught sight of senor carrajos automobile swinging in through the gate the don himself was at the wheel and in the tonneau and the seat beside him sat four uni- formed soldiers of the republic won- dering vaguely what the trouble could be widmer joined them at the veranda buenas dias srfior the little planter called cheerily it is at a most opportune time that you have come to visit me his excellency the presi- dent has received information that i am plotting against the government-i miguel carrajos senor one of guate- malas most loyal citizens-and he has ordered that my property shall be searched tt is very good humor eh senor come you shall enjoy the fun with a resumption of his former hearty laugh he turned and bowed the soldiers into the house widmer with a sudden suspicion for which he could not account followed him he was no novice in the art of house searching for years that had been in his line of duty but never in all his experience had he known so thorough a search as he witnessed now no door did they encounter that was not open d no floor or wall that was not sounded no nook or cranny that was not explored to its innermost recesses just what they were searching for of course widmer did not know and he did not feel as if he were privi- leged to ask but that the article occu- pied a goodly portion of space was made evident by the very nature of the search in the end as the planter had predicted the investigation came to naught the officer in charge shrugged his shoulders resignedly there seems to be nothing here senor carrajoshe admitted but you have other prop- erty i believe there is the house on the hill the little planters eyes lighted with a peculiar triumph ah yes my dear comandante i have other property true but unfortunately for your pur- pose it is immune the house on the hill is at present occupied by my friend here senor widmer a born american citizen there could be no mistaking the sat- isfaction with which he pronounced these words while widmer stood there struggling between anger and in- dignation the soldiers turned and stared at him quite a respectful stare it was albeit tinged with a great surprise the officer in charge removed his cap and bowed in that case of course he stated quietly there will be no further search any house that is occupied bv a citizen of the united states is sacred toward that country we feel only the closest friendship and the deepest re- spect sefiores i bid you good day  that was all he took his position at the head of his men and the little company filed back to town they left widmer standing there staring after always there  them like a man in a trance his cheeks were flushed his eyes snapped he felt duped exploited betrayed so this was why senor carrajos had been so generous with him he had been merely bargaining for the protection of his american nationality a nationality which he had hoped would forever be kept secret it came over him suddenly that he was merely the tool of this contemptible little scoundrel a hired accomplice engaged in some gross and illegal enterprise he was just about to give expression to his thoughts when carrajos inter- rupted him buenos senor you are an admirable assistant i do not think those fellows will bother us again eh  his black beady eyes were fairly aglow with cunning and elation and widmer gazing at him found his former suspicions increasing to abhor- rence and disgust his hostility toward the man mounted to the boiling point but he had no idea of backing out of the affair his interest in it now had increased to such an extent that he was determined to see it through at any hazard and even as he stood there his brain alive with conjectures hit upon a solution that staggered him it was with difficulty that he retained his poise you are indeed most for- tunate senor he said pointedly but if you will excuse me now i shall re- turn there are some stupid affairs of my own you know that simply must be attended to widmer seemed obsessed by a con- suming eagerness and curiosity hav- ing reached his house he hurried im- mediately to his cellar perturbed by a sudden fear that the object he sought might be gone but the six large cases of tobacco were still there and seizing an ax he pried one of them open in- stantly he stepped backward giving vent to a single suppressed exclama- tion for a long time he stood there staring panting beneath the stress of his conflicting emotions then he seemed to come to a sudden decision with quick skill he hammered the lid of the box on again ascended to his rooms and secured a pair of binoculars as he stepped out upon the veranda his cheeks were glowing his heart was thumping wildly she ought to be coming back by this time he said sweeping die horizon but the sea lay about him as bare as a ballroom giving an exclamation  of impatience he was about to turn back into the house when he caught sight of a small dirty lugger anchored some distance below town there should have been nothing strange in its appearance for such craft came and went continually but widmer was now in a mood where he suspected anything and everything that he could not im- mediately account for sweeping her with the glass he perceived no move- ment upon her decks to all appear- ances she was deserted but this merely heightened his suspicions a vessel that lies idle in the day- time must carry on her work at night he declared grimly i think shell bear watching chapter iir seen and understood it was in the early afternoon of the next day that as he sat on his veranda widmer was greeted by a dis- tinct surprise on the road below him he discerned approaching the anti- quated automobile of senor carrajos he wondered what business the planter could have with him now for since the events of the preceding day he had lost all desire for further acquaintance but the next instant he discovered that carrajos was not alone in the seat beside him was the senorita teresa herself looking more radiantly beauti- ful than ever in a flutter of excite- ment widmer hurried inside to make himself presentable  top-notch magazine a hot day senor said the planter as he dragged himself puffing and per- spiring from his seat we thought to find it cooler up here on the hill widmer engaged in the very pleas- ant occupation of assisting the girl merely nodded the house is yours my friend if you will come up on the veranda i will have refreshments served immediately though he spoke casually he was in reality keenly alert despite car- rajos explanation and the presence of the girl he suspected some ulterior mo- tive in this visit they had not been on the veranda half an hour when senor carrajos glancing casually toward the harbor in- dicated the mysterious lugger with a nod by the way he remarked with a characteristic twirl of his mustache the vessel that is to take my tobacco came down last night senor i shall set my men at work loading her to- day most of the tobacco is already at the wharves but i have a small por- tion up here you may have noticed it-the six cases in the cellar his tone was quiet almost indiffer- ent but as the black beady eyes met widmers they held a certain challenge and it was only because he had been expecting this challenge that widmer found himself able to meet it his heart beat so loudly that he was com- pelled to drum on the table top to still it when he spoke however his voice was comparatively calm yes i no- ticed it i guessed it was tobacco and which way does it go senor- south the planter rose to the bait guile- lessly no north there is a firm in mazatlan whom i am supplying reg- ularly but see here come my men rising excitedly he indicated an an- tediluvian oxcart that was toiling la- boriously up the hill widmer rose with him his recent air of satisfac- tion becoming replaced suddenly by one of keenest excitement in the midst of his dilemma he turned upon the girl to find her gazing at him her eyes alight with understanding and a mute appeal that appeal it was that re- stored his own balance with lips grimly set he faced forward again sweeping the sea with his sharp eyes and as he did so he could barely re- frain from crying out for there hull up on the northern horizon was the same gray gunboat he had observed a few days before perspiration sprang out upon wid- mers forehead his hands trembled how soon would she arrive how near would she come how could he get away without arousing suspicion but his reflections were cut short by an exclamation from his companion how slow an ox team is it will be half an hour before those fellows get here what do you say senor to a game of cards widmer could have shouted for joy capital ill get the cards myself almost before he had finished speak- ing he was away but he did not im- mediately carry out his errand in- stead he rushed to his room secured a large american flag with which senor carrajos had provided him and climbed through an opening onto the roof the gunboat had drawn nearer now so near that tliose on board could discern him easily with glasses with practiced skill he unfurled the flag stepped to the edge of the adobe roof and began wav- ing it in a manner that would have aroused the interest even of the unini- tiated that his signals were seen and un- derstood by those on board the gunboat was made evident a moment later a triangular flag broke from her mast- head her funnel smoke thickened and her bow wave became a regular cas- cade with an exultant whoop wid- always there	 mer laid down the flag and hurried below a moment later cards in hand he had joined his companions well what shall it be he asked cheerily making no effort to conceal his elation poker pinochle bridge or- but senor carrajos who was star- ing intently seaward interrupted him i see we have a visitor senor wid- mer  he said frowning an american gunboat i am afraid the card game will have to be postponed i have cer- tain interests which might be imperiled if i remain away come teresa we must be going he turned as h spoke and started to leave the veranda but he had not taken three steps before he paused squarely in his path stood widmer an automatic pistol in his hand his attitude one of grim determination im sorry he said but that privilege i must deny you senor carrajos you will please consider yourself my pris- oner chapter iv always the same there was a simultaneous gasp from the girl and carrajos but while the eyes of the girl held only open astonishment those of the man lighted suddenly with the fear of a trapped an- imal he caught the table edge in a palsied grasp his face white his teeth achatter your-your prisoner senor you are joking miguel car- rajos has never harmed you why then should you wish to detain him widmer smiled you are a poor pretender my friend he said your safest course is open confession i sus- pected your real vocation from the day i first saw you and later events have confirmed it beyond a doubt you are interfering in the mexican revolution where guatemala would remain neutral you are a filibuster sir engaged in furnishing munitions of war to that arch rebel villa i can prove this by the six oblong cases in the cellar they are to be shipped to mazatlan and they contain not tobacco but rifles there was a quick gasp from the girl but that was all miguel carrajos merely stood there and stared impo- tently into the barrel of the automatic his beady eyes aflame his hands twitch- ing convulsively in the end he laughed but not pleasantly even so but that is a matter between myself and president carranza of mexico my fellow where do you come in  widmer did not answer him imme- diately he sent a brief searching glance over his shoulder the gunbct had come abreast of the town now and was already turning her prow shore- ward the oxcart containing four persons was halfway up the hill i come in he said as one of those directly injured wlien you were aid- ing villa you were conspiring not only against the soldiers of carranza but against the american troops under per- shing as well for that as a born american citizen i demand repara- tion his voice had risen a little when he finished his cheeks glowed with more than their ordinary color carrajos reading beneath the voice and the color became suddenly as vindictive as a wasp and who are you to talk of patriotism he jeered you are an exile an outcast a fugitive fror amer- ican justice perhaps you are prob- ably as much in danger from that gun- boat as i am stand aside you fool and let me pass widmer however stood firm the sudden tightening of his lips argued that carrajos shot had struck pretty near home but instead of causing him any embarrassment it seemed merely to add to his determination all trace of his former hypocrisy had van tied now he stood before them like a man top-notch magazine redeemed his head erect his eyes shin- ing fugitive  may have been he de- clared tensely and a deserter too but thank heaven i am such no longer a month ago i held the rank of lieutenant aboard the united states gunboat c hauettge the vessel which i have just now signaled to stop but my captain and  got into a quarrel over a pair of black eyes and too much spanish port and in my frenzy i knocked him down as a consequence  rendered myself liable to court-mar- tial and dishonorable discharge from the navy rather than endure this dis- grace however i slipped overboard one night when we were abreast of ocos and swam ashore my country had wronged me i thought and i vowed never to return to her again but when my rage had cooled and i discovered your infernal plot against her i thought otherwise i discovered that to be an american once is to be an american all the time the spirit is always there now i shall never rest content until i have turned you and your contra- band articles over to the authorities my own punishment i shall submit to gladly his concluding sentences rang out clearly aglow with the joy of a man who once lost has found himself again but senor carrajos did not seem to share in his enthusiasm all the time widmer was speaking he had kept his eyes on the gunboat the vessel had come to anchor now and a swarm of white-jacketed marines were pouring over the side the planters eyes sud- denly acquired a desperate light as he stood he was between a chair and the table with a hand laid support- ingly upon each at the precise mo- ment that the american finished speak- ing he leaned upon his supports brought up his foot with the rapidity oi lightning and sent the blue auto- matic pistol flying off the veranda hi manuel carlos he shouted to the approaching peones and at- tempted to follow the pistol though taken altogether by surprise widmer recovered himself instantly carrajos had not gained the veranda rail before he was upon him then the two went at it hammer and tongs though widmer was the bigger man his antagonist was as slippery as an eel and so vicious as to use his teeth as well as his limbs the american would have cherished no fear for the out- come however had the two been alone but even as they fought he saw that carrajos shouts had reached his men and they were coming up the hill on the run the marines though like- wise en route had hardly come to the outskirts of the town it was practi- cally impossible for widmer to per- form the double task of holding to his prisoner and warding off his assailants until they arrived and he soon saw that his little coup was likely to be a disappointment still grimly he fought on as to the senorita teresa widmer was vaguely conscious that she was standing white-faced and silent beside the table just before the peones reached the house however he heard her give a quick gasp saw her dart to the veranda rail and leap lightly over fie surmised naturally that her move was one of flight and though he could not blame her for it he felt slightly piqued at her for her desertion but he had sterner things to think of just then than regret encouraged possibly by the nearness of his fol- lowers carrajos made another attempt to wrench himself free bv a serpen- tine twist he managed to jerk his body forward and throw it halfway across the veranda rail though widmer held to him tightly the move destroyed the balance of both of them the american was conscious of a sudden always there  descent of a violent blow upon the head and then-darkness chapter v not to be outdone hen widmer came to himself again he was lying on the lawn with his head pillowed upon something soft an aroma of heliotrope was in the air tender hands were bathing his forehead he heard a gentle voice he was not surprised therefore that when he opened his eyes he should find his bead resting upon the lap of the seno- rita teresa oh cried the girl quickly i thought senor that the fall had killed you shyly she removed his head from her lap and laid it upon the grass but once conscious widmers strength re- turned quickly he sat up rather diz- zily and looked about him and simul- taneously he gave a start of surprise roundabout stood a group of white- jacketed marines at rest upon their rifles grinning in their midst held firmly by the arms were the four peones who had accompanied the ox- cart and on the grass ten feet away lay the form of miguel carrajos whom two of the marines were industriously engaged in bringing to completing his gaze widmer saw another figure beside him the figure of an officer at sight of whom his face suddenly flushed and his hand mechanically went up in salute you-youve got them captain deming he asked they must have led you a merry chase i think they ran away when i fell off the veranda there was a second of awkward si- lence on the contrary returned captain deming quietly it was the senorita teresa who got them when we arrived we found you and senor carrajos unconscious upon the grass and the lady holding up the peones with an automatic pistol she has been kind enough to give us all the particulars of her uncles plot widmer turned quickly and glanced at the girl though her face was flam- ing she did not look away but met his gaze bravely and what he read in her eyes started his heart to pounding and set his brain on fire for a moment sheer joy held him spellbound then in a flash he appeared to remember his dream faded his eyes clouded his lips curled into a bitter smile slowly he arose and faced his superior officer if the lady has told you all sir he stated grimly there is no need of my explaining further but i realize that there is another matter for which i must account which does not con- cern senor carrajos i have prepared myself for this accounting for some time past i am ready to go aboard now sir as your prisoner there was another silence a silence prolonged and acute the two men stood there staring at each other each as splendid an example of the young american naval officer as our country affords the countenance of captain deming was the first to relax his gray eyes softened his bronzed cheeks acquired a tinge of color he came forward and lowered his voice this matter that you speak of lieutenant widmer was a personal af- fair was it not there is no need for making it official unless i choose to do so for the sake of your coun- try you have just now sacrificed your liberty and placed yourself in danger of disgrace am i as captain of my vessel to be outdone in patriotism by one of my officers id be pretty much of a cad if i werent willing to make some sort of a sacrifice too as one gentleman to another he held out his hand widmer reading the mind of his captain as he would have read his own forgave as readily as he had been forgiven his own hand went top-notch magazine out and gripped the others firmly captain deming he began brokenly if ever you need- but his commander cut him short with a laugh pshaw i think the affair has furnished a lesson for both of us widmer and now  must be getting these fellows aboard the vessel as to yourself he glanced at the senorita teresa and his eyes twinkled i dont think ve shall require your presence until the trial comes off will you come aboard or remain ashore widmer looked at the girl and in her flushed cheeks and glowing downcast eyes he seemed to find his answer when he faced captain deming again his own eyes were shining i think ill stay ashore sir he said and re- port later colors unfurled by everett earle stanard dy heat and fire and smoke ol the battle fray o the mountainside by

threatened with consump- tion due to a reckless life grace winslow daughter of the senior member of the firm of winslow  addison lumber barons was staying at camp balsam on clear pond really she had come up into the maine woods to escape the unwelcome attentions of danforth addison son of her fathers partner one day grace got lost in  gloomy part of the great woods known as haunted land so named from a legend to the effect that here tommy hatchet an indian had killed his wife and wytopitlock baptiste with whom she had run away and then died on the spot himself the story was that the spirits of all three haunted the place and reenacted the tragedy as grace thought of this she heard wild yells and screams looking around in ter- ror she saw a powerfully built grim and bearded man sitting on a log smok- ing a pipe and quietly watching her expressing his contempt for the sounds he guided her back to the camp which jurtl	- was run by louie le barge and anne his squaw wife whose brother seely booker was employed there grace made her rescuer stay to supper he interested and puzzled her she did not know as yet that he was bob bain- bridge of bangor returning to the lumber game after several years dis- appearance bainbridge had been a big man in bangor and a terror to the lumber trust and all crooks but he lost interest in life when his wife died but now he was back and was behind the northern west branch company an independent concern which was building a sluiceway through haunted land to get its logs from made pond to the kennebec-the only way out for them as winslow  addison controlled the penobscot after supper the camp was unex- pectedly visited by danforth addison johnny orz the w  a manager andy pick a w  a spy and cam mcdougal a crooked timber boss who had been discharged bv bainbridge bainbridge frankly admitted his iden- tity and his responsibility for the sluice-  top-notch magazine way scheme in a rage addison de- clared that winslow  addison would use every means to wreck the plan and crush the man behind it mcdoogal attempted to strike bob but bain bridge threw the bullys arm out of joint- afterward throwing it back and apolo- gizing to grace for being the cause of such a scene in her camp when he left those in the room knew that they were dealing with a big man grace felt it and she looked at addison with increased disgust bain bridge spent the night alone in haunted land he wanted to investigate those mysteri- ous sounds to find out who made them and why he found no explanation however and was returning to the n w b camp at made pond when sud- denly he came on the body of a dead man with an indian arrow through his heart the man was nick webb whom bainbridge had ordered dis- charged for smuggling whisky to the men bob reported his discovery to condon his camp manager and said he suspected that the killing of webb with an indian arrow and the yells and screams in the woods were all part of a plan to intimidate the superstitious french canadians employed by the n w b with bill spratt an old guide parson hall a quaint character dowd one of his men bainbridge set out to give webb a decent burial reaching the spot he was surprised to find addison pick mcdougal and seely booker looking down at the body raising his finger and pointing pick accused bainbridge of the murder addison showed his gleaming teeth in an unpleasant smile youre in deep mr bainbridge he exulted weve got the goods that will make you come to terms-or land you in court charged with murder if wins- low  addison demand your arrest the high sheriff of the county wont lose much time about nabbing you and put- ting lhe irons on your wrists chapter xvi the man of nimbler wits it was not easy to tell what eltect the words of danforth addison pro- duced upoa bainbridge even at a short distance the dull light partly veiled the expression of his face and his eyes were shrouded in the deeper shadow beneath the lopping brim of the old felt hat that he wore for some seconds he stood without speak- ing apparently turning addisons threatening statement over in his mind dowd and hall were somewhat un- easy bill spratt was grinding his gums together his under jaw working from side to side for he was boiling witji wrath and almost bursting with a de- sire to tell the son of old dig addison just what he thought of him the self-restraint of bainbridge was some- thing the indignant guide could not quite understand presently bob spoke his voice was calm and smooth and pitched a trifle lower than usual if anything it was not apparent that he had been greatly impressed or disturbed by addisons threat nevertheless he asked  and if i come to terms what will happen lets have a clear understanding i dont propose to be fooled you cant double cross me addison youve got to speak out flatly so that therell be no misunderstanding of your meaning what are the terms you refer to you know i dont have to tell you answered addison you are the man behind this crazy scheme to construct a sluiceway for the purpose of getting logs out of the woods and into the ken- nebec only for you such a thing never would have been dreamed of go on well never allow it to go through but itll be easier for us if its dropped youve got so much pull with the n w b people that you can make them drop it haunted land  and if i do that this webb affair will be dropped too is that the idea is that what youre suggesting i tell you ive got to have it straight from you here and now no vague uncer- tain stuff come across with your proposition addison believed bainbridge was weakening if so then it must be that bob had killed wade and was fearful of being brought to trial for the crime up to this point in spite of the accu- sation he had made a doubt had lin- gered in danforths mind now the doubt disappeared webb had fol- lowed bainbridge into haunted land with the revengeful intention of kill- ing him there if he could find the fa- vorable opportunity for the black deed aware of the deadly purpose of the shiftless wretch bainbridge had struck first in a way it was self-defense but with winslow  addison arrayed against him the man who had com- mitted the act was afraid to face it through before a jury ive got you my troublesome bird thought addison his exultation leaping to a high point at one time you may have deserved your reputation of being a man nobody could beat but you havent the nerve you had in those days and luck has given me a club to ham- mer you flat with itll be a big sat- isfaction to know that im the first man who ever did it had he been less exultant less posi- tive in his conviction that bob was really alarmed and weakening he might have been more cautious his failure to realize the fact that he was up against a man whose cleverness he could not match with his far less nim- ble wits led his tongue to blunder like a person stumbling in pitchy darkness nobodyll ever bother much about what has happened to webb unless somebody with plenty of influence takes the matter up and pushes it he said even if it becomes known that he was killed here in such a mysterious way whos going to take trouble and spend valuable time to solve the mys- tery and bring the one w-ho killed him to trial  of course you understand said bob that im not admitting that i had anything whatever to do with the affair oh of course said addison wisely and sneeringly you dont have to ad- mit that but you are quite positive that i did it theres circumstantial evidence that makes me absolutely positive and if i pledge myself to see that the projected log sluice is never built through these woods youll do-what i tell you that youve got to come out flat with it if you want to make a bar- gain with me ill see that the matter is hushed up money will do that he gave a faint but significant nod toward his companions you wont have to worry about being arrested and put on trial you can go your way and leave it to me then bainbridge nearly knocked ad- dison over with the words that were shot from his lips i want every per- son here to take notice and remember what that man has just said not only has he proposed to condone a crime but he has proposed to enter into a conspiracy to conceal it he has pro- posed to make himself an accessory after the fact in order to gain an advantage of importance over business rivals he has stated that he would pay hush money to seal the lips of those who knew about the crime addison youre a bungling dub enlightened concerning the reason for bainbridges restraint and delighted by the trap into which danforth addi- son had been led bill spratt burst into a jeering chuckle baked beans an frizzled flapjacks he cried addie top-notch magazine  sartin made a runnin high dive an went under all outer sight will he ever come up  mcdougal swore yer talked too much mr addison growled the lum- berman tenderly feeling of his lame shoulder while he glared at bob ive found out that you dont never want to talk to him ther way to do is hit him quick before ye ever say a word thats ther way illdo next time andy picks mouth worked nervously and queerly but no words came forth hands on his thin hips seely booker remained silent also his immobile face giving no hint of his thoughts addison gulped and sought to pull himself together you-you may think that youre pretty clever bain- bridge he faltered but youll find out that your cleverness wont do you much good when winslow  addison get after you i-i was only trying to lead you  anyhow i never in- tended to make a bargin with you if you had agreed it would have been additional proof that you murdered this poor fellow and it would have been used against you anyway i think theres proof enough to lay you by the heels but youll never try to use it re- turned bob with an air of absolute certainty your protestation of your purpose comes late and has the cracked ring of a poor lie then danforth addison gave way to a fit of wrathful chagrin that made him almost incoherent as lie snarled and raged at the man who had outwitted him mice sweet-tempered baby com- mented spratt if he was to bite somebody nov theyd have the rab-bies sure i dont wonder miss winslow wouldnt have him in the camp last night an made him pound his ear in a hammock out on the veranda ill get you bainbridge ill get you shouted addison you cant make a fool of me if the remark warnt so gosh- darned mildewed an mothett muttered spratt id tell him that natur had done that job aready mebbe hes goin to choke chapter xvii the deadly arrow addison and his companions had found the body of nick webb and were in possession of it bainbridge and his friends willingly and gladly left them to do whatever they chose to do with the dead man with bob again in the lead they turned their faces to- ward made pond although spratt kept looking over his shoulder until the woods and the shadows had wholly blotted out the quartet that was watch- ing them take their departure even andy pick didnt darst try to shoot anybody in ther back said the guide mebbe he would if hed bin alone but there was too many wifr nesses to see before they had proceeded far hall unable longer to repress his desire to warble began to sing a familiar hymn this time bainbridge did not stop him for he no longer felt that there was any reason for not wishing to attract attention to their presence in haunted land and hall appeared to find great relief and comfort in droning the hymn in the most lugubrious manner imagi- nable spratt however was irritated id ruther hear a passle o cats squallin in the night he declared why any- body with a voice like that should wanter murder the peaceful silence is moren i can guess although the singer heard the re- mark he continued through to the end of the hymn then he addressed the guide william spratt he said youre a lost soul steeped in sin and haunted land  wandering in darkness i shall pray for you huh grunted bill go ahead old boy they were still within the limits of haunted land when bainbridge called a halt well hold a council of war you and i bill he said weve got plenty of time and theres no need to rush i want to smoke and id like to know what you think about some things well talk over smokins easy an agreeable said spratt but thinkin thoughts ahvus was like work fer me they sat down beneath a huge tree against which bainbridge leaned hall and noisy not having been invited to take part in the council seated them- selves on a small fallen tree a short distance away having filled his old black pipe and lighted it the guide began to chuckle i didnt see what you wras up to when you took addies sass so sorter quiet an onresentful he admitted an thats proof that i aint got no hair-trigger thinker i didnt see what you was leadin him into he didnt nuther by golly he near went right out from under his hat when you slapped him with that condonin-crime and excessory-after-the-fact stuff he thought he had you down on your mar- rerbones an pladin it set him back worsen losin a jack pot with an ace full in his fist ive formed a poor opinion of dan addisons reasoning power and judg- ment said bainbridge hes not in- herited much of his fathers foxy cunning although hes just as unscrupu- lous he ought to realize that getting me out of the way isnt going to stop the n wr b people from building the sluiceway im only one individual and though i originated the scheme it has gone beyond my control now youre an individual thats goin to have gobs o trouble with gentle ad- die if he can make it fer ye hell hate ye like pisen arter this an try ter do ye a nasty turn outer pure spite keep your weather eye peeled says i what i want to get the right slant on bob stated is the part andy pick is playing in this performance of course he found the body of webb and led the others to it likely co-rect addison stated that pick was the one that see it its my theory that pick knew where it was before they came anywhere near the spot you dont think do ye asked spratt softly that andy was the party that give webb his ticket i havent made up my mind defi- nitely but ill admit that ive asked myself if it might not be possible anythings possible mr bain- bridge but why should he go for to kill nick webb-with a bow an arrer remember what you told me about pick over at made pond a short while ago-about how he was the only person who gummed this strip of woods and how he claimed to have seen and heard the most bloodcurdling spookv things here yep of course he wras lying about the spook stuff if he had ever heard or seen such things hes such a coward that nobody could get him within miles of this section but youve heard an sen queer things here yerself which andy pick himself may be responsible for by golly said the guide mebbe but whatd he ever be cuttin such didos for not just to keep other gummers away he wouldnt kill a man he didnt have northin aginst just to scare folks off i cant blieve that bad as he is mr bainbridge ill allow that im foggy concerning the motive behind this fake-ghost stuff confessed bob my original idea was  top-notch magazine that the w  a people had become wise to our sluiceway plan and had hired somebody to do the ghost business in hopes that our workmen would re- fuse to do a stroke here it seemed childish but i couldnt think of any- thing else that might be behind it what i heard last night at camp balsam knocked that theory out of my head vow my suspicion has fallen on pick but ill admit that having gummed the territory over last winter hed be fool- ish to go to such trouble merely to keep other gummers away if hes behind the spook business hes got another and bigger reason what is it gosh said spratt if you dont stop youll set me to tryin to think an thatll give my head a cramp spratts whimsical manner caused bainbridge to smile well well get off that line now bill the connections too poor for us to do much intelligent talking over it didnt you say that grace winslow refused to permit dan- forth addison to sleep in camp balsam last night yep an all his cooin round her didnt make no difrence she was un- feelin enough to insist that hed have ter snooze on the veranda even if the skeets loved him so much thet they ett him up alive shes afraid of him not prezactly afraid mebbe but i guess she wouldnt trust him no fur- thern she could fling a bull moose by the left hind laig wise girlj oh she knows a thing or two even it she is almost too good lookin to have brains just bein with her brother to take keer o him wasnt her only rea- son for cornin up here inter the woods an not lettin nobody know ceptin her own immjyate faraly just where she was gone to louie le barges got two ears an of course hes heard her an her brother talkin it over some louie let slip enough to wise me to it that she wanted to keep away from addie who was botherin her extensive because shed handed him the mitten after bein engaged to him or near engaged it pears that her own dad wasnt never high pleased with the prospect o havin addie for a son in-law even if he was the spring-off of kirk winslows pard- rer in business crime mr winslow figgered it that his daughter could do better than to let addie put the halter on her artd it was him that had the camp at clear pond fixed up arter she left he give out the impression that shed gone west to look the rocky mountains jver an if hed known of dig addisons plan dan addisiond never got up here an found her this was merely a confirmation of what bainbridge had already suspected or deduced from what he had heard and seen it had been apparent that grace winslow was chagrined and an- noyed by the unexpected appearance of dan forth addison at camp balsam and in spite of her undoubted courage bob believed she was afraid of her former suitor its too bad that he found her he said he may make it so disagree- able for her that shell have to leave camp balsam and get out of the woods i have a feeling that she isnt safe there well le barge can be trusted an hell try to look out fer her kirk winslow knew louie was all right an thats why he hired him how about booker the guide removed his smelly pipe from his mouth and wrinkled his nose seelys an injun but theyre like other human critters sometimes theyre all right sometimes they aint just now hes traipsin around with dan addi- son which aint good for him if ad- dies brung in a cargo o forty rod seely likes the juice but he tries to keep away from it havin the sense to know its bad for him if addie was haunted land  to get him loaded an pass him a sup- ply o sperrits fermenti seelyd keep slewed fer ten days an wouldnt be no use to help look after the girl perhaps the fact that miss wins- lows the daughter of danforths busi- ness partner will hold danforth in check mebbe mebbe but i wouldnt reckon on it too extensive hes got his old mans notion for takin what he wants no matter who it blongs to spratt cocked an inquiring eye to- ward bob his pipe slanting upward at an angle from the corner of his mouth he had a desire to say something per- sonal and it was not his custom to smother such a desire even with a man like bainbridge for whom he had the greatest deference i dont mar- vel that youre ruther consamed about the girl he stated shes the kind you hear about but dont often see about my interest in her declared bob quietly is the interest that any man might have in a woman in danger otherwise i have no interest in any living woman it was an implied rebuke that made spratt suddenly feel a little ashamed of himself knowing as he did how tremendously crushed bainbridge had been by the death of his wife and how following that bereavement he had shut himself off from the moving world had practically disappeared and become a solitary hermit in the northern wilds even now after more than a year of hermit life and even though fate had drawn him into the activity of a timberland business struggle he was de- cidedly different from the ever-cheer- ful clean-cut bainbridge of old who had been almost scrupulously careful of his personal appearance when such a thing was possible his ragged beard and his soiled and worn old clothes made it evident that he still cared not at all how others might look upon him perhaps when the time came that the sluiceway was built and successfully put into operation he would again vanish into the wilderness there to re- main for years to come with only the birds and beasts and untamed creatures of the woods for companions it was not hard to imagine him in his natural human desire to talk to somebody pour- ing out the sorrow of his heart to his wild neighbors and friends not only did bill spratt feel rebuked for verging upon familiarity in such a way he was suddenly whelmed with sympathy for his companion and would have given anything he possessed had he known of some delicate way to ex- press that sympathy he cleared his throat with a rasping sound well he said we owe thanks to addie an his bunch for savin us the trouble o plantin nick wonder what theyll do with him bob shifted his position and dropped upon one elbow i havent- he began the twanging sound of a bowstring was heard in haunted land some- thing struck the tree against which bainbridge had been leaning a moment before the quivering feathered shaft of an arrow stood forth from the trunk of the tree in which its head was buried and it most certainty would have pierced bob bainbridges throat had he been still sitting with his back gainst thetree chapter xviii unaccountable vanishing at inscrutable fate whose shield- ing or guiding touch we sometimes feel and recognize had saved bain- bridge from almost certain death he had changed his position at precisely the proper instant to make ineffective the accurate and deadly aim of the unseen bowman he saw the trem- bling arrow in the tree spratt saw it  top-notch magazine iley exclaimed the startled guide looker that cornbread an mer- iasses the critter just missed ye seizing his rifle bob leaped up spratt scrambled to his feet shooting iron in hand his piercing eyes search- ing the shadows look out he warned the sneakin whelp may let another one fly bob knew the direction from which the arrow had come he could see no living thing in those shadows but the would-be assassin must be there some- where crouching and springing to one side to get the cover of a clump of underbrush bainbridge ran forward spratt did the same and although somewhat slow to grasp the meaning of what had happened noisy dowrd and hall followed them plunk him if ye see hide or hair o him  urged the guide fiercely thats ther way to fix that kind of a ghost bob had no intention of letting the murderous unknown get away should he see him while he did not relish the idea of shooting a human being he was now roused to the point of doing so rather than to let the wretch escape it would be more than justifiable it would be a duty in order to protect others from the homicidal miscreant even spratt had no keener or quicker eye than bainbridge yet hur- rying with recklessness toward the spot fromwhich the arrow must have been sped bob looked in vain for a human figure or some moving shadow seeking to flit away into the deeper shadows save for himself and his associates the immediate woods seemed to be as utterly empty of life as ever where is the gosh-blamed skul- lion  panted the guide cant ye see northin of him hes just gotter be right round here somewhere bob slopped and glanced back if he proceeded farther he would pass beyond view of the tree beneath which they had sat he had reached the far- thermost point from which any human being could have shot the arrow with him in sight even here it seemed it must have been difficult to single him out in the gloom beneath the tree right around here bill he said in a low tone look sharp we must beat every bit of possible cover we must get him ill get him if i clap a blinker on him returned spratt his rifle ready for instant use his finger on the trig- ger dowd and hall drew near both searching every place of cover they approached

tracks thats just about as good as seely bookers an i aint been able to find any that we didnt make now bainbridge likewise had a clever eye for signs made by the feet of hu- man beings or animals and

out leaving some such sign for the prac- ticed woodsman to perceive gosh  muttered bill spratt aint it a funny feelin to have your hair rare up and stand on its hind laigs even bill was awed by the seeming uncanniness of the affair if a man like him could be frightened how much more terrified would the superstitious french canadians be should they have an experience of a similar nature bainbridge realized far better than he had before this that the mysterious occurrences that were transpiring in haunted land might bring about great and undesirable delay in the construc- tion of the

when they approached made pond again from a distance they heard the screech haunted land  of the mill saw and the chugging of the hoisting engine for condon was working the men overtime and paying them double wages for it the same as when they departed they avoided approaching the laborers who were handling and piling the sawed lumber on the top of the bluff and came down to the pond by a course that enabled them to arrive there without attracting particular notice tlirough the treetops and above them the western sky was burning red and the reflection of it flung upon the bits o water of the pond from which the crowding logs had been removed gave that water the color of blood all signs seemed to foretell another day of parching heat and one could only guess when the baking spell

refreshing they were drawing near the long building when a figure that caused bainbridge to catch his breath in sur- prise appeared in the doorway a sec- ond later grace winslow came hurry- ing toward them her tanned face aglow with relief oh she exclaimed im glad to see you back mr bainbridge im glad that youre alive and safe i would have tried to follow you and warn you but mr condon wouldnt let me he was sure that you could take care of yourself chapter xx about men who conspired dob gazed at her in wonderment he had not dreamed of seeing her here  at made pond her words seemed to denote that she had known of some particular danger that had menaced him and had made a great effort to reach him and put him on guard had her knowledge to do with anything that had happened in haunted land he asked himself was it pos- sible that she had somehow learned something that would serve to help in clearing up the mystery miss winslow he said taking off his battered hat this is a surprise how did you get here walked there wasnt any other way it wasnt nearly as far as i tramped through the woods yesterday who came with you nobody evidently getting lost hasnt made you afraid not so much that i would hesitate when i knew you were in danger i owe you something for what you did for me i always pay my debts she was quite grave and sincere her ways were frank and straightforward her brown eyes were eyes to believe in eyes to trust bob was about to question her when condon came striding swiftly in their direction uttering a hail and waving his hand he nodded his head to the  top-notch magazine girl as he came up i told you miss winslow that bob bainbridge could take care of number one he said he knew where he was goin and i knew hed keep his lookers skinned so that there couldnt nobody or nothin get near enough to take a crack at him bob smiled weve had some lively and interesting adventures hank and somebody-or something-did take a crack at me but missed grace uttered a little cry i knew i told you mr condon lets not talk here said condon quickly lets go inter my shanty wont need hall and dowd will we no all right boys you can go and clams never talk too much were the clammiest clams you ever saw brother condon hall assured him absolutively confirmed noisy condons shanty not far from the mill was an insignificant little slab shack containing one room only which was a combined living room sleeping room and office at one end of the room was a bunk of single width on which however there was a comforta- ble mattress and proper bedclothes for it was the custom of the n w b company to furnish every employee with a decent bed and provide him with food no living man could kick at near the bed was a wash stand made from a long orange crate stood on end it supported a tin washbasin in which now stood a metal pail that was filled with water a piece of cotton cloth served as a curtain for the open front of the crate above the crate on the wall beside a cheesecloth-screened window was a cheap square mirror on a shelf beneath the mirror was condons shaving outfit i here was only one real houghten chair in the room and that was a wide stout high-backed affair with arms and having a cushion that was merely some old garments folded to fit the seat the other chairs were of the homemade sawbuck variety the armchair stood beside a large rough table on which were scattered letters papers maps timber surveys and reports condon insisted that miss window should take that chair he urged bob and spratt to sit down also now first thing he said i want to hear from you mr bainbridge you got my curiosity all haired up i want to know wliat you meant by sayin that somebody or something took a crack at you and missed of course if any of the details would be shocking or unpleasant for miss winslow you can leave them out but enlighten me on that one point if you dont mind doin so you may as well have the whole story said bob when we arrived at the spot where i had found the dead man we discovered that another party was there ahead of us the members j of that party were danforth addison mcdougal pick and seely booker and addison promptly proceeded to accuse me of murder ruther interesting commented j condon promises to be a story worth harking to reel it off bainbridge did so in as few words as possible while condon and the girl listened with rapt attention spratt re- frained from interpolating any remarks whatever although he felt a strong yearning to throw a few high lights on bobs rather bald narrative espe- cially in reference to the mysterious affair of the arrow and the unseen bowman say said condon when bob had  finished much more of that sort of business aint going to be good for us i could see by the look of hall and dowd that somethin had shook em up it takes somethin staggering to ruffle noisys nerves too whats your explanation of the way it was done- haunted land  i regret to say that i havent any explanation now but im going to have one that will explain this is the first time ive found it imperative to catch a spook but im going to catch this one you must be careful mr bain- bridge-you must exclaimed grace winslow earnestly you have enemies who will hesitate at no dastardly deed to destroy you i know that is what brought me here to-day i heard them talking-danforth addison johnny orz and that dreadful creature pick  saw them with their heads together outside the camp near the edge of the woods and i could tell by their actions that they were arranging something wicked so i slipped out of the camp by the back door and crept through the woods until i was as near to them as i could possibly get without being seen they were talking in low tones and i could get only a word or two now and then but what  heard was enough to convince me that they were plotting to kill you it was pick who was urging that it should be done and danforth addison-danforth addi- son-listened and agreed to the mon- strous proposal where was seely booker ques- tioned bob quickly you didnt men- tion him as one of the party he was not they didnt take him into their confidence oh no seely wouldnt have a hand in such dreadful business hes annes brother hes law-abiding and loyal she was quite as earnest in her de- fense of the indian as she had been in her expressed horror of addison the man she had once fancied she cared for enough to become his wife merely to speak the name of addison now seemed repugnant to her and doubtless the thought that she had trusted and admired him at one time possibly had fancied she really loved him filled her with a sensation of humiliation and shame like many another clever ras- cal he had been able to mask his true character midst the artificiality of mod- ern city life but once in the big woods and afar from the restraint of being constantly beneath the eyes of hun- dreds who knew him hundreds upon whom he wished to impress the convic- tion that he was a person of high moral rectitude and superior importance his real nature was asserting itself but booker was with them when addison accused me of murder in haunted land said bob because asserted grace after hearing them plotting i told him what i thought they were up to and asked him to get in with them stick to them warn you if possible balk their dread- ful scheme i was doubtful about booker con- fessed bainbridge you are a good advocate for him if you hae made no error in your estimate of him im glad he was with them for he may learn or hear something that will aid me in defense if they really try to make legal trouble for me by pushing this ridiculous murder charge they wont do that said condon im not so sure returned bob it could be done and it might be done just to get me away from here for a short time while i was being taken be- fore a judge for examination miss winslow just what did you heai when you listened in the woods near camp balsam  pick was whispering and i couldnt get his words but i could see him and he made gestures that were horribly significant and expressive it was like a person creeping upon something and shooting at it then orz nodded and said to addison andys right bain-  bridge must be put out of the way and thats the way to do it then addison told him to speak lower and after that  top-notch magazine i caught only the words dead man ambush mustnt fail and must be done quick perhaps i might have un- derstood more if my heart hadnt made such a pounding noise it seemed loud enough for them to hear it how long was this arter i quit off with addie an pulled my freight asked spratt not long andy pick showed up within fifteen minutes after you left he came in a great hurry and got ad- dison and orz out by the edge of the woods for that talk where was mcdougal at the time questioned bainbridge sitting on the veranda nursing his lame arm i had given him some lini- ment for his shoulder he was ugly and sullen i think he was sort of keep- ing watch while the others consulted orz wasnt with the party when we encountered them in haunted land no he stayed at clear pond to watch a crew of men who had appeared on the eastern shore and were doing something over there our pipe layers- said condon with bates the engineer in charge of the bunch orz can watch his head off bainbridge seemed to be -turning something over in his mind  dead man ambush he thought tts possible they were speaking about nick webb not me webb was dead and he had been ambushed i have a theory that pick knew all about that when he returned to camp balsam me may have told addison and orz and per- haps they were afraid to take mc- dougal in on it then when the bunch started out mcdougal was taken along so that he could testify afterward that they came upon webb by accident as it may have seemed to him they were willing that booker should be with them too so that he could also say that they stumbled upon the murdered man in an accidental manner all this is more or less in the way of guess- work but it may be an accurate and correct deduction nevertheless sounds reasonable allowed con- don  mustnt fail and must be done quick may have meant that they mustnt fail to put the onus of the crime on me and must be in a hurry about doing so said bob but johnny orz said that you must  be put out of the way  reminded the girl  surely they could put me out of the way most effectually if they could i get me tried and convicted of murder  returned bainbridge giving her the  faintest of smiles im not seeking to depreciate in the slightest what you have endeavored to do for me miss winslow and i want you to know that it will be a long time before i forget  it it was a brave thing for you to hurry here alone and unprotected through the woods in order to wam me at this a flood of warm color flowed  into her cheeks i had to slip away  secretly she stated if louie le  barge had suspected he might have < raised a fuss. My brother was having j his regular daily nap, and I pinned a j note on his breast, telling him where j [ was going and that I might not even I be able to get back to-night. I knew | there was an old. overgrown road that \ would bring me close to this pond, if j I could find and follow it. I found j it, but a mile from here I came upon I a big crew of men who were at work j clearing out the road. They didn’t see me, and I struck into the woods and j circled round them.” “Our swampers,” said Condon, “get- ting the road into condition so we can skid the pipin’ up along the line to i Clear Pond. Though they wouldn't trouble you, mebbe it was just as well you didn’t let ’em see ye. A girl, all HAUNTED LAND 119 alone in these woods, would be bound to stir up some excitement.'’ Bill Spratt had been covertly watch- ing- Grace Winslow. He had weighed the motive that had impelled her to make that lone venture through the forest. He had taken note of her flush following Bob's frank praise and state- ment that he would not forget what she had done. “Well,” thought the guide shrewdly, “mebbe he’s the sort that won’t never tie up a second time, and mebbe he ain’t got no more int’rest in her’n lie would have if -she was hombly as a hedge fence; but I’ll bate my last year’s Mack- inaw that, having seen a real man what is a man that makes Dan Addison look like a wart on a hackmatack tree, she's gone under, head over heels. She may not know now just how hard she’s smit, but she ain’t no fool, and it’s goin’ to * dawn on her mighty violent an’ upset- tin’ that she’s gone an’ let herself fall in love with Robert Bainbridge, esquier. An’ when a girl like her knows she’s done a thing like that, she just lays herself out to collar the man an’ lead him to the hitcliin’ 'post. They have ways of workin’ that trick that makes it seem like they ain’t never thought of no such thing, but they get there with both feet. If Bob Bainbridge con- tinners to want to play a lone hand an' play it safe, it won’t be long before he’ll have to take ag’in to the onknown an' oninhabited forest depths, an’ forget to leave his address behind. That's sartin as juniper tea makes good spring med’cine.” CHAPTER XXT. WHEN THE WHISTLE DID NOT BLOW. QRACE had supper that night by lamplight after the laborers had finished eating in the dining room of the long building. Bob Bainbridge and Hank Condon ate at the same time. “Of course,” Bob told her, “we can take you back to Camp Balsam to-night, if you want to go. I’ll g£t Spratt, and we'll take lanterns. It would be a fool- ish thing to try if we weren't sure of the ground, and it won’t be easy or pleasant, anyhow. Still, with our knowledge of the territory, and with a compass, it can be done.” She rested her elbow on the table and supported her chin with her hand. “I -I know I must be a perfect nuisance and awfully in the way here,” she said, “but I just don’t see how I ever could keep my feet under me to tramp all that distance through the woods again to-night. I didn’t know' I w'as so tried. I don’t understand it, for I never am really tired-much; but somehow' I seem to be all in. It must have come from the excitement, the anxiety. But if you think that I-” Condon heaved a protesting growl. “What’s the matter with her stayin’ here if she wants to, Mr. Bainbridge?” he demanded, glaring at Bob. “I guess she’ll be safe, all ^ight. I guess we can put her up and look out for her. She can have my shack, and there’s a bar to the door and there’s a gun, and if she gets scart she can holler, and that’ll bring us humping it hotfoot to see what’s the matter. She is tired; she shows it. And it’d be plumb in- human to make her hoof it back to Clear Pond to-night, besides bein' a fool thing to try.” “I proposed it merely because I thought she might feel that she had to go,” said Bob, Condon’s indignation compelling him to grin. “I w'as think- ing that her brother might have fits over-” “Oh, he’s had them already,” Grace said, laughing softly. “Poor Roy! He has fits over everything I do that he doesn’t approve of, and he certainly would disapprove of me coming here on any pretext. But he’s entirely safe at Camp Balsam, and I don’t believe 120 TOP-NOTCH MAGAZINE it’ll do him any great harm to stay there without me tonight. He's become alto- gether too lacking in self-reliance. He’s been petted and humored all his life, and his illness has caused him to show how much such treatment has hurt him. I’ve merely been waiting for him to get a little better before forcing him to show more manhood and to depend on himself to a greater extent/’ So it was settled that she was to spend the night at Made Pond. After supper was over the two men csc'orted her back to Condon's shack. At the door, she paused to listen. From the little shanties where some of the laborers slept, beyond the long build- ing, the sound of a violin and some one singing to the accompaniment came through the breezeless darkness. The singer had a surprisingly clear and melodious voice, and the words of the old song reached them plainly: I’s cornin'! I's cornin’! Mah head is bendin’ low! I hear those angel voices callin' old Black Joe. “The boys is pullin’ off a little grand operv to-night before turning in,” said Condon, with a laugh. “Mebbe they’ll all turn to and gargle before long. But they won’t keep it up long, Miss Wins- low, so your rest won’t be disturbed any to speak of in that fashion.” “I wouldn’t mind it at all,” she re- turned, "ii they were to sing half the night." "But I would,” he declared quickly. “They’re hired to work, and they got to get their sleep, and plenty of it.” There was a brief period of silence, broken only by the peeping of hundreds of frogs around the margin of the pond and by an occasional laugh, faintly heard, coming from the direction of the shanties. Then suddenly one voice started the famous Maine rivermen’s song, to be joined almost immediately, it seemed, by twenty others: The river’s on the rise and the drive is on the run. We’re sluicing down the logs, and mebbc it is fun. We’re on the jump all day. and mebbe half -the night, And when we get our grub we only snatch a bite; For bed wc have the ground, and it’s rotten cold and wet, Hut there’s belter times to come, so what's the use to fret! So what's the use to fret, my boys. oh. what’s the use to fret! When our logging days are over, we’ll whoop ‘er up, you bet! There’s lots o’ gals in Bangor, and likewise lots o’ rum. So whoop 'or up, my boys, for the rousin’ time to come. The roaring chorus made the woods echo far across the pond. The tune, as well as the words of the song, gave an impression of rollicking, half-savage recklessness; of daring men who found excitement and joy in the hardships they endured while compelling the forces of nature to aid them in the serv- ice of their employers, the lumber barons; of men who would unhesitat- ingly risk limb and life for their monthly wage, all the while looking for- ward to a time of roistering when they would squander in a few hours per- haps what they had earned in weeks of lusty toil-not infrequently all that they had earned during an entire sea- son. “Fools!” said Condon. “Daring, big-hearted children,” said Bainbridge. "Anybody that should call one of ’em a child to his face would have a fight on his hands,” Condon declared. “I guess you know, as well as me, how sudden they are to resent it if they think anybody’s sorter looking down on ’em from aloft, so to speak. I’ll step inside and light up for you. Miss Wins- low.” When Condon had lighted the swing- ing oil lamp in the shack Grace entered, and Bob stepped just within the door HAUNTED LAND 121 for a moment, closing it behind him to keep out the mosquitoes. *T hope you’ll sleep well, Miss Wins- low/' Bainbridge said. “I’ll see you back to Camp Balsam as soon as you wish in the morning. As Condon has said, you're quite safe here. Put up the bar lo the door when we leave you, and-” The door was flung violently open. Danforth Addison came in, followed by Johnny Orz and Seely Booker. Ad- dison’s face was heavy with wrath. “I’ve come to take you back to your camp, Grace,” he announced, ignoring Bainbridge and Condon. She had paled a little, but she faced him resolutely, defiantly. “You could have saved yourself the trouble, Mr. Addison. I am not going back there to-night.” Her voice was quiet but determined. “Oh, yes you are !” he told her. “You can't stay here. I won’t allow it.” “You!” she exclaimed scornfully. uYou won’t allow it! You haven’t anything to say about it.” “I have! You can’t refuse to rec- ognize my right, which, finding you here, is a duty to your father, if noth- ing else. I shall protect you.” “Protect me! You.! I need none of your protection. Besides, I am in no danger whatever. I’m sure that I’m much safer here than I would be at Camp Balsam to-night” “Safer here! Safer in a camp of tough lumberjacks and rowdies ! You’re crazy, Grace. You don’t know what you’re talking about. You've got to come out of this with me, and come now. I shall compel-” “You won’t compel her to do any- thing at all, Addison,” Bainbridge cut in upon him. “She has given you your answer, and you'll take it-and get! It’s your move. Move !” Danforth Addison turned on the speaker a look of deepest malignity. The hatred within his heart was de- picted in his eyes and his face. His lips curled back from his white and even teeth. His expression was wolf- ish. "You had better let this young lady alone, Bob Bainbridge!” he snapped. “You’re in trouble enough already, but you’ll get in still deeper if you try any tricks with Kirk Winslow’s daughter.” “A common, trick)’ scoundrel like you,” Bob answered him, “thinks every other man must be full of the same sort of low dodges. Miss Winslow has your number. Her father will have it, too, before long. Don’t you think you’d better be on your way before you’re given a start?'’ “Which is going to happen in about a minute,” growled Hank Condon. “Don’t try any rough stuff with me!” snarled Addison. “You can't bulldoze me, not even here in your own squat- tery. When I go, Miss Winslow goes with me. Orz backs me up in that, and Booker, too.” “Sure we do,” affirmed Johnny Orz nervously. But the Indian remained silent. Standing near one of the screened windows, Condon held up a silver whis- tle. “When I blow this,” he told Ad- dison, “anywhere from fifty to a hun- dred timber terriers will come on the jump, all eager to fall on the neck of anybody I point out to 'em. They’ll handle you with a great deal of gen- tleness-I don’t think! I’m gettin’ ready to let her blow.” “And keep your hand away from your pocket, Dan Addison!” Bain- bridge warned sharply. “I don’t want to break your wrist with a bullet, but I assure you that I’m watching you, and I know that I can pull a pocket gun twice as quick as you can.” Orz edged away from the immediate vicinity of Addison. “Better not, Dan- forth/’ he said quickly. “They’re on their own territory, and I know what II happen to us if something starts here.” 12 2	TOP-NOTCH MAGAZINE “Wise little Johnny," sneered Con- don. “He’s not itching to swing from a limb/’ “They wouldn't dare touch me,” de- clare.! Danforth. "I’m the son of Digby Addison.'* “They’d touch you some and ask your name after they'd finished the job,” said Condon. “They have a way of being hasty and heedless in their do- ings. Do you go or does she blow?” He was ready to put the whistle to his lips. “We’d better go, Mr. Addison,” urged Orz. “What can we do against such odds?” Danforth made one final appeal to the girl. “Come, Grace!” he besought her. “Let me take you back to the carrtp.” “I wouldn’t dream of it,” she said. “And I want you to keep away from Camp Balsam hereafter. Away from me, too. I’ve found out just what you are, and you’re worse than I ever imag- ined you could be.” “Bainbridge has been lying about me!” he snarled. “You’ve believed his lies. But when you see him under ar- rest, when you learn what sort of a man-” “Last warnin!” came from Condon. “She blows!” “Hold on !” begged Orz. “We’re go- ing-w'e're going right now. Come, Mr. Addison. If you wait another sec- ond, I’ll leave you here.” “You’re a quitter,” said Danforth. “If I had any backing- All right, I'll go, Condon. I’m coming back, though, and it will be different when I do. As for Bainbridge, he’s close to the end of his rope. He knows what I mean. Let him tell you about it. lie’ll be sure to add some lying details, but-” He stopped and turned to- ward the door, for Johnny Orz had run out of the shack and left him. “Come on, Booker,” he commanded. “I stay,” said the Indian. “In the morning I take Miss Winslow to Camp Balsam. 1 stay, and she is safe, any- how.” “But don’t let that encourage you to linger anywhere within miles of Made Pond, Addison,” cautioned Condon. *'I may send some of the boys out a little later to look around for prowlers. If any such are seen in the dark, they’ll certain get hurt bad. Touch the high spots, Addison. Good night, and good riddance to bad rubbish. Please ciose the door after him, Seely. That's right. Thank you."’ CHAPTER XXII. THE HUSn BEFORE THE STORM. OAVE for the usual hustling activity of the N. W. B. laborers, it ap- peared that very little worth recording took place at Made Pond or anywhere around there for more than a week. The work of laying the piping to bring water down from Clear Fond to the sluiceway was carried on steadily and rapidly by one crew of men, while an- other crew \\*as hard at it building the sluice itself. In seven days they had constructed it from the top of the bluff to within a short distance of the border of Haunted Land. “It’s too all-fired quiet,” Condon told himself and Bainbridge more than once. “Somethin’s going to bust loose with a crack before long. I feel it in my bones.” All the while Bob had been doing his level best to keep his promise to cap- ture the spook and clear up the mys- tery of Haunted Land. In that time there was not a single night that he did not pass in the black and silent woods of awesome repute. But in order to carry his determination into execution, as well as for his own protection from the unknown assassin, he thought it wise to enter and depart from that region secretly; therefore he nearly al- ways did so under cover of darkness. HAUNTED LAND 123 One whole day he lay hidden near the locality where he had first heard the dreadful shrieks and shouts, and within sight of the spot where he had found and examined the puzzling footprints. He seemed to have wasted his time. Nothing happened in the deserted woods; the silence and desolation re- mained unbroken. “I know what the trouble is,” Bob told Condon one day, laughing shortly. “The ghost doesn't know that I’m there. He’s the sort of a h’ant that one has to advertise himself to in order to start a seance. He never performs unless he’s sure that he has an audience.” “Well, he’ll have one in another day or two,” Condon returned, “and then I suppose lie’ll begin cutting up didos that'll make half the crew quit. I wish you could nail him before we get to buildin’ her through that black tim- ber.” “You don’t wish it any more than I do,” declared Bainbridge; “for, besides falling down on my promise, I’ll own up that there’s something about those woods that is beginning to get my goat. The lack of life, the crushing silence, the impression that there is something horrible and uncanny hovering close at hand-well, it’s threatening me with a case of nerves, and T never was both- ered with anything like that. Why, the very atmosphere there seems to weigh down upon a person after a time. I’ve told myself that it’s nothing but imagi- nation,, and that’s what it must be; yet I’m getting so I can’t rid myself of it.” “I don’t wonder much,” confessed Condon. “I don’t know anybody else that’d care to creep -in there in the dark and set up all night watchin’ for a critter that’s a sneakin’ assassin, even if he ain’t a ghost. Doing that, and keepin’ it up, ought to give you the wagglewoggles.” Twice during that week Bob visited Clear Pond and presented himself at Camp Balsam. He found Grace Wins- low at the camp each time, and he was a bit puzzled to detect an odd change in her. Somehow she was not like the frank, straightforward, high-spirited girl she had seemed to be. Not that there was a particle of slyness or con- scious deception about her, but she seemed to have grown somewhat shy and timid and reserved, and he noted that whenever he appeared she flushed amazingly and then became almost deathly pale for a short time. Nor could she seem to talk with him with freedom and without restraint, though it was apparent that she made an effort to do so. And, like that, she interested him even more than she had at first: for he was a strong man, and his were the fine instincts of such a man, who e sympathies are always moved by a wish to give protection to one of the oppo- site sex who may seem to need it. There’s a whole lot in that stuff about the sturdy oak and the clinging vine. Danforth Addison and Johnny Orz had disappeared from that region after their unsuccessful visit to Made Pond, but Bob believed that Grace must be in constant dread of Addison’s return ; for he had vowed that he would come back, and there had been an open threat in his vow. But she professed that she was not afraid of him. “Seely is staying here all the time now,” she said, “and he’ll see that noth- ing happens to me. Louie would fight for me, too. Besides that, I know how to shoot, and I keep a loaded weapon within reach. But really Danforth wouldn’t dare do me any actual harm, lie would fear the wrath of Kirk Wins- low.” Bob did not mention Andy Pick. Seemingly the gummer had taken him- self away also; for none of the N. \Y. B. laborers had seen him, and Roy Winslow, when questioned, stated that Pick had not shown himself again at Camp Balsam. Bainbridge wondered 124	TOP-NOTCH MAGAZINE if the absence of the gumrner accounted for lack of further ghostly demonstra- tions in Haunted Laud. Roy seemed to be as fretful and peevish as ever, although Cob almost believed that he could see a physical improvement in him. It was during Bainhridge's second visit of the week to Camp Balsam that something caused Grace to leave him alone for a short time with her brother on the veranda. Suddenly Roy said: “I don't see why Dan Addison doesn’t come back. He said he would. He said he didn’t pro- pose to let your crowd put through the scheme of running a log sluice with water taken from this pond. And I know that you’ve got your pipe line almost laid and are nearly ready to turn the water on now. I’ve been watch- ing your men over there on the east shore. You’ve got a lot of them, all that can work there, and they’ve been hustling making the water gate for the pipe line. Addison will be too late if lie doesn’t get a move on.” Bob smiled. “He’ll never stop us, my boy. We’ll operate that sluice, just as we’ve planned to do, even if I have to hire an arrncd patrol at my own expense to guard every foot of the pipe line and sluiceway.” “Well, if he comes back there’ll be a little excitement around here, anyhow. I’ll be glad of that. I’m going crazy for the want of it. Specially since sis- ter’s got so queer and dreamy. She isn’t a bit like herself. She won't even talk to me any more unless I just force her to. And sl>e doesnt want to be doing things the way she used to half the time she arts like shes in a trance sometimes i have to speak to her two or three times before she even hears me i wonder if shes going to be sick bainbridge made no response for of a sudden a most disturbing idea had entered his mind it did not seem possible and yet-what was it bill spratt had said to him about grace winslow  when the girl came back to the veranda it was bob who was changed and constrained his manner had al- tered and he was distant to the point of aloofness within three minutes he ro-c abruptly saying that he must get back to made pond a while later sitting on an old log in the woods he thought it over again he told himself that it was impossible that there was no sense in it but some- thing seemed lo whisper to him that it was true and the possibility instead of pleasing him filled him with deep regret if it is so he diought pres- ently i cant see how i am to blame its all wrong im sorry but i cant see her any more i shall keep away from her then he arose and went on his way toward made pond from the mill condon saw him coming and hurried out to meet him barker our mail carrier is just back from kittston a little while ago said die foreman he says theres seven or eight lads hangin round there that he never saw in these parts before and he knows most evry- body that ever put his nose into this shank of the woods they peared to be just loafing round and doing nothin barker said tough-looking gang too they eyed him up a lot we should worry about seven or eight tough-looking customers said bob laughing mebbe theres plenty more to foller or perhaps theyre round about some- where right now we dont want to be took by surprise i havent yet brought myself fully to believe that w  a will try any militant maneuvers against us they might against a weaker crowd that could be frightened oh i havent for- gotten dan addisons threats but he s a hothead and hed have to have the backing of his fathers company now listen here mr bainbridge barker was tipped off warned warned  yes by whom  boggs the storekeeper uh-huh boggs watched for his chance and whispered inter barkers ear look out for squalls over your way pretty soon-that was what he said he wouldnt darst come right out and say it and that he darst whisper it to barker comes pretty nigh provin that we better give heed bob was thoughtful for a moment of course there may be something in it he said presently the w  a crowd is unscrupulous enough to do anything that they think they can get away with but theres a law- dont talk about law in the same breath with them  exclaimed condon hank said bob i have an idea that the spook of haunted land is off on a vacation so i think ill take a little scout over kittston way to-morrow and see if i can find out if there really is anything brewing for us chapter xxiii in the grip of menace in spite of condons apprehension that bainbridge would get into trouble at kittston bob persisted in his de- termination to go there and to go alone he declined even to take spratt along although the guide had complained dur- ing the past week that it didnt seem right for him to be drawin down merely for sitting around made pond and eating three squares a day ill play this hand without any help hank bob told the disturbed fore- man im not worrying over anything half a dozen timber thugs will do to me in kittston theyll be careful there and if any of them should try to follow me when i leave it will be a simpler matter for me to do a fade-out by my lonesome in the woods than it would be if i had somebody along to bother about dont fret oh have your own way  condon grumbled i know you will anyhow you alwus do from made pond to kittston as the crow flies it was five miles at least but anybody who tried to make the shortest possible cut through the woods would be forced to tramp much farther than that because of necessary detours to get round swamps and impenetrable jungles the usual way to travel from made pond to kittston was to go up the inlet from the river until the river was reached and then follow the path of the log drivers down the western bank of the river that way however it was said to be more than ten miles bainbridge chose the shorter route striking out early the following day instead of his heavy oil-grain boots he wore stout moccasins which he had been wearing during his recent nightly visits to haunted land not only were they lighter and easier to the feet es- pecially in warm weather but they en- abled him to slip through the woods with greater silence he took his time for he felt that there was no reason to hurry and need- less haste in the big woods is a folly that experienced woodsmen rarely per- petrate nevertheless although they may appear to be merely swinging along at a lazy jog they get over the ground in a way that soon tires any greenhorn who tries to follow them  it was past mid-forenoon when bain- bridge drew near kittston a place of one house a combined general store and post office and a big square build- ing that had been erected to take care of logging crews going in in the fall and coming out in the late spring at this point on the river had been con- structed the koomoobes dam pro- jected for the purpose of holding a  to i-n c tc  m a azn li supply of water that would be of great value iu running logs laic in the spring it was the back flow from this dam that had filled made pond following round the side of a hill hob stopped suddenly for he was look- ing down on two men

men glanced upward and perceived bob also instantly he grabbed his companions arm and drew his notice to the unin- tentional eavesdropper the latter smiled as the pair quickly slipped into the woods and hurried away no need to fear me he muttered   m not interested in maine gold mines  agree with dave that there amt no such animal still taking his time he descended the hill and followed the men who had apparently made for kittston he could hear the dam rips roaring and in a short time he came forth into a clearing with kittston before him the three buildings of the place all faced to the south and bob approached from the north with the dam on his left above the dam a crew of men were at work on a boom from which logs were being methodically sent into a current that carried them through an open gate of the dam and down the river below the drivers were attend- ing strictly to their business and none of them seemed to jay the slightest at- tention to bainbridge as bob approached boggs store a squatty single-story building the sounds of a harmonica came to his ears somebody was playing a lively dance tune on the mouth instrument suddenly from the front of the store there rose a burst of wild hoarse gargantuan laughter followed by shouts of applause from several throats that was enough to denote that some- body or something was providing great amusement for a gathering of men who were not at work of course they might be rivermen of another company waiting their turn to send logs over the dam then again they might not bainbridge did not pause or hesitate until he had passed the side of the store and arrived at a spot where he could see what was going on besides boggs avho stood in the open doorway there were nine persons in front of the store some

burst of laughter bainbridge had heard was a singularly grotesque and hideous creature a be- ing who in many ways bore a remark- able resemblance to a gorilla not over five feet in height he had short

his feet seemed somewhat too large at this moment they were bare of any covering the toes were long and sin- gularly prehensile in appearance the soles of those peculiar feet looked as if they were calloused and hard as leather set on a thick corded neck the head of this creature-it seemed almost bor- dering upon libel to call him a man- was shaped much like that of a gorilla there was the same massive under- shot jaw the same retreating head above the bushy eyebrows and scarcely any forehead at all the eyes were beady and black and restless a growth of coarse bristling black hair extended down the back of his neck and disap- peared beneath the tattered old shirt that he was wearing that shirt was open in front exposing a powerful hairy breast his old trousers were frayed and tattered below the knees at the moment of bobs advent upon the scene this travesty upon humanity was standing in a crouching attitude his dangling hands almost touching the ground his blinking eyes fastened in

Where You Can’t Catch Cold IF you want to avoid all likelihood of catching cold in future, you had bet- ter turn explorer and trot oft to the arctic regions. There sneezes are un- known, and a cough would probably scare a polar bear out of its life. Although the clothes of explorers in those regions are often saturated with perspiration, and are a mass of ice when they retire for the night, and despite the fact that they often have to sleep out in the open in their sleep- ing bags, and that this is their only means of thawing themselves, their health does not suiter in the least. Then there is the classical, and some- what mythical, instance of the St. Kilda cold. On the rocky island, lying some forty miles beyond the \\ estern Hebrides, there are about one hundred inhabitants, access to whom is practi- cally impossible during eight months out of the twelve, owing to the stormy seas. Oddly enough, however, when- ever a steamer touches at this island, all the inhabitants, including the very infants-so runs the legend-are seized with violent sneezing fits, which de- velop into colds. Exposure is not the direct cause of colds. It simply acts on a lowered vitality. The only safeguard is con- tinued exposure. is an Did Maid ? Edtfar White o :F course I struck him, and I’d do it again!” exclaimed Phil Caxton, whose arms were held by two men who ran between Caxton and the monocled Harold Douglas, the target of the blow. ‘There, there, old man!” said Victor Grove, who had charge of Caxton’s right arm. “Don’t be so rough. He only said she was an old maid. That wasn't treason to the government. Some old maids are nice.” "He’s an infernal cad!” cried the flushed Caxton. “A man that will men- tion-” “Tut! Tut! Let’s get back to the game and forget him.” The affair occurred on the golf links at Forest Highlands. Douglas had mo- tored out with some friends, and, while crossing the field, had passed near where Caxton was making a drive. Then some whim prompted him to say: “Saw that gay old maid of yours over in town to-day, Phil.” Like a flash Caxton straightened up and struck him. The players ran to the fracas, and to the query of “Doc” 9B tn Halstead, Caxton replied as first quoted. The woman in the case was Helen Halstead, the pretty niece of Doc Hal- stead. She was light-haired, blue-eyed, and lively. She was a sort of protegee of Phil Caxton’s. Phil, who lived with his aunt out at Forest Highlands, often called of an evening and took Helen for a ride in his car. As he was on the downward side of forty, with frost touching his hair, he regarded Helen as little more than a child. In the few months he had lived out at the High- lands, he noted that she did not seem to have any young men companions. He imagined that she must be a little lonely, and that was why he drove over for her at- intervals and took her out in the car. Sometimes her aunt would accompany them and at other times Caxton’s relative would go. But more frequently the aunt couldn’t go and Caxton and Helen would go by them- selves. Pie taught her how to run the machine, and, when she became used to it, he let her go to the garage and get it whenever she wanted to. Caxton, down in town, was a very 130 TOP-NOTCH MAGAZINE busy man, and, aside from his aunt and Helen, he had no associations with the other sex. He liked Helen in a sort of fatherly way, but that was all. She seemed so young and fresh along- side a commercial veteran like himself that it never occurred to him that the interest between them could be more than platonic. As he thought over Douglas’ “insult- ing'’ remarks, Caxton began to feel as if he himself were not altogether free from blame. When a man of middle age is seen with a feminine friend pretty regularly he should expect some more or less good-natured banter. So Caxton reasoned the way to prevent embarrassment to Helen was to stop driving around with her, and let her associate with some one he considered more suited to her years. The incident on the golf links that afternoon, bad as it had been, would have some value as a warning of the plight into which he was getting Helen. Of course, the fel- lows out there would say nothing about it, and there would be no likelihood of the affair ever reaching Helen’s ears. W hen Caxton got home that evening he found Helen seated in the auto wait- ing for him. She was attired in a loose-fitting gray suit, open at the neck, and with her gloved hands on the steer- ing wheel she looked wonderfully healthy, competent, and distressingly pretty. ‘‘Jump in,” she said. “I’ve been waiting ever so long for you.” She flung open the front door of the car for him. She had cranked the engine when she saw him coming. It was a terrible temptation, but after what happened that afternoon Caxton knew it would not do. I le took off his hat and ran his hand through his hair as he approached. “Miss Helen,” he said gravely, "I-I have some work to look after down in town this evening. Suppose you take Doc Halstead or your aunt out riding instead?” She looked at him with swift suspi- cion. “There's a carnival at Maitland," she told him. “1 thought you’d enjoy driving over to see it.” "So I would,” he declared earnestly; “but I--I-you see I just have to-” "Very well,’’ she said, and got out of the car. "Now, please don’t be angry, Miss Helen,” he said hastily. "Drive over for your folks and take them out- they’d enjoy it.” "If you don't want to go, that ends it,” she returned coldly, her head high in the air, as off she started afoot for her home. He was tempted to run after her and surrender, but on reflec- tion he knew* that their breaking off was bound to occur sooner or later, and that this was the way it would be. As he looked at her moving away so proudly, yet so deeply hurt, his heart sank with the realization that the one real happiness of life had gone out. But it had to be. He was forty and getting gray. Even now the fellows in the office were referring to him as “the old man.” For him to keep on running about with a pretty, vivacious girl like Helen would only cause other and per- haps more disagreeable incidents than the one with that “cad” Douglas. II. A LTHOUGH Caxton, in his course of self-abnegation, reasoned that he was a “has-been” and would soon be on the shelf, he knew he was as good and as strong a man as ever he was, and that he did not look his age by five or six years. He had never sow-n his wild oats, and there were no lines of dissipation on his thoughtful face. Early manhood had brought to him the care of invalid parents and later he had helped to rear some younger brothers and a niece or two. Middle age found him the head of a fairly prosperous business, and the idol of an aunt who WHEN IS AN OLD MAID? 131 lived with liitn. Aunt Becky and the Halsteads had become good friends since the Caxtons moved into the neigh- borhood, and particularly Aunt Becky was fond of Helen and watched with interest what she regarded as the grow- ing intimacy between the young lady and her favorite nephew. Caxton had supposed that the affair on the links was closed. It was a star- tling awakening when Victor Grove told him that Douglas was preparing to bring a civil action for personal in- juries to his nose, doctor’s bills, and “public humiliation.” “How much does he want?” asked Caxton, with a whimsical smile. “Not much,” answered Grove. “Just a hundred thousand dollars.” Caxton jumped out of his chair. The smile was gone. “The man’s crazy!” he cried. “He knows I can’t raise any amount like that!” “I wouldn’t give him a darned nickel,” advised Grove. “You can beat him at the trial.” “But that girl,” protested Caxton; “they'll have her name in the papers. Perhaps the rascal will subpoena her as a witness just to mortify her.” “I expect he’ll talk about doing that very thing for the purpose of scaring you to come across with an offer of ten thousand to compromise,” said Grove. “I wouldn’t give him a cent until I had the last say-so from the highest court in the State.” Nevertheless, Caxton hurriedly got together cash and securities to the amount of twenty thousand dollars and went around to Douglas’ office. The man with a one-hundred-thousand-dol- lar injury' put up his monocle and scru- tinized his caller. Douglas was tall and thin, and had what people call “an in- tellectual countenance.” But all his intellect ran to cynicism. “Ah,” he said, “it's Mr. Caxton! Won’t you have a chair?” Caxton went directly to the issue. ’“I understand you’re about to file a suit for one hundred thousand dollars against me, Mr. Douglas,” he said. “Yes,” returned Douglas calmly; “I believe my lawyers are drawing up some papers of that description.” “That's ridiculous!” “Yes; but not any more ridiculous than to hit a man in the face for noth- ing. I didn’t say anything to justify such-” , “Well, passing that,” remarked Cax- ton impatiently, “how much will you take to settle this thing?” “A hundred thousand dollars.” Caxton frowned. “You know all- fired well, Douglas, that you don’t ex- pect the jury to give you a twentieth of that!” “Then why not wait and see what the jury will do?” logically asked the prospective plaintiff. ‘“Because a trial will necessitate most unpleasant notoriety to a modest, re- fined young woman. It will nearlv kill her.” “I presume it would be embarrass- ing,” conceded Douglas thoughtfully, “but it wouldn’t be any more so than for a fellow to get a lick on the nose in the presence of a-” “Let that be, Douglas! I'll give you ten thousand dollars casTi not to file that suit. 1 have the money right here with me. What do you say?” “No.” “Fifteen thousand?” “No.” “Twenty thousand ?” “I tell you, Mr. Caxton, that this is a waste of time. The only settlement I have authorized my lawyers to con- sider is one hundred thousand cash- the amount to be named in the plead- ings.” “You’re an infernal scoundrel!” cried Caxton hotly. Douglas adjusted his optical aid and calmly scribbled something on a paper. Then he casually observed: 132	TOP-NOTCH MAGAZINE "For that we’ll put in an additional fifty thousand dollars for slander. I’ve written the words down on this paper -see?” Caxton hesitated as if considering whether to twist his adversary’s neck or punch his head again. Fearing his rage would get the better of him, he abruptly left the office. Ii he could have raised the one hun- dred thousand dollars without depriv- ing his aunt of her home and seri- ously crippling his business, Caxton might have done so. But his better judgment rebelled against his going to the limit in his efforts to compromise, even at the cost of some humiliation to Helen. He wrestled with the problem sev- eral days; then decided to lay the mat- ter directly before her in order that she might know what he had done to pre- vent the inevitable, and be fortified against it. Since the day she had walked away from him with her chin in the air he had not seen her. Re- membrance of that unpleasant event made his present task doubly embar- rassing. Then he had offended by re- fusing to go riding with her; now he was coming as an apologist for his failure to raise enough money to save her from a mortifying publicity in the newspapers and (he courts. Certainly there could be no hope of any good results from such an interview; yet he saw no other way. Perhaps if she knew' that he had done what he could, she would not hate him quite so much. III. p?OR the sake of his peace of mind Caxton hoped he would not find Helen looking so neat and trim as when he last saw her. That picture of her had remained fixed in his memory, the sparkling blue eyes, the cunning ringlets of light: hair under the broad- brimmed hat, the gloved hands on the steering wheel of his machine-she was all this and more, and she was there waiting-wailing for him! Aunt Dinah, wearing a red bandanna over her kinky locks, greeted him: “Why, Mas’ Caxton! Ain’t seed yo’ for de longes' time! Yo’ been poly ? Ain’t lookin’ so well, somehow. Workin* too ha'd, Ah reckon. Mis’ Helen ? Sho’! Ah’ll sen’ de chile right down to yo’. Jus’ step into de settin’ room-lemme take yo’ hat." Helen presently appeared, and Cax- ton’s heart sank into his boots.. If she were pretty in her loose-fitting gray suit, she was lovely in her house gown, with its rolling collar and short sleeves, allowing the white, round arms free- dom of movement. Her light hair wasn’t mussed up as he hoped, but waved seductively over two shell-like ears, and was caught up in a. bright braid behind. There was the bloom of health on her face and in the eyes- not sparkling as he knew them-but of steady, unfathomable blue. She did not offer him her hand, but casually indicated a chair. In all his life Caxton never felt greater embarrassment. The wonder- ful charm and beauty of the girl, her reserved, but entirely composed, man- ner, made him feel like something that crawls. While he was struggling to pull him- self together and nerve himself to ex- plain to her as briefly as possible the disagreeable situation, and to offer sug- gestions that might make it easier for her, there persistently intruded the thought of his forty odd years, his graying hair, and his general air of antiquity, while across on the other side of the room sat, as he saw it, youth in its flower, coldly waiting to hear why he had dared, to come into her pres- ence. He began falteringly and with dis- connected sentences, hiding things here WHEN IS AN OLD MAID? 133 and there, blunderingly trying to keep out what he had done to protect her, but letting enough in to indicate the nature of the suit he would have to defend, and why it had been impossible for him to keep it out of court. "He has subpoenaed me as a wit- ness,” remarked Helen quietly. “The villain! He’s simply done that to make it as embarrassing as pos- sible.” “No; it's to prove you were not jus- tified in striking him. He says that he spoke of me as an old maid-” ‘‘I never told you what he said,” protested the amazed Caxton. “No; but I heard. He spoke of me as an old maid and you struck him.” If Caxton had not been so excited he would have observed a tender note in the voice that would have inter- ested him, but all he could think of was the infamous expression Douglas had used. “To be sure I did!” he ad- mitted. “And I’d do it again. The idea of his lying like-” “He didn’t lie.” “Wha-what did you say?” “When does a girl get to be an old maid?” asked Helen. It was like throwing him in a pond without a life preserver. “Why, I-I never thought. I guess when she’s ’long about thirty-I don’t know. Of course you are not-” “Of course I am,” replied Helen, with determination. “I’m thirty-three!” She looked at him steadily out of those deep blue eves, which said, if eyes ever talked: “What are you go- ing to do about it, sir?” Caxton stood up. Helen also rose, but kept her eyes on him. “Why, Helen,” he said, involuntarily moving toward her, “if that’s the case”-he was close enough to reach her, but she did not move back-“then I’m not- I’m not-” “Too old?” she asked, laughing. “Nobody said you were. You’re just a-a-” Whether the smothered word was goose or gander or something else was never put in the record, but with the understanding that followed the com- pact, Caxton was surprised to note that every vestige of fright over the one- hundred-thousand-dollar case had flown, and Helen clinched that view in these words: “Let him go on with his trial if he wants to; it would be lots of fun-the way things are now.” On Its Reputation MR. NEWRYCH, thinking that a motor car was essential to his po- sition, decided to obtain one at a cer- tain place recommended by one of his friends. “I want a good, reliable car,” he said to the manager on his arrival the next da}r. “Yes, sir; we have the best in the trade.” “I want the best on the road,” com- mented Mr. Newrych. “There it is !” exclaimed the manager, pointing to a certain car. “I should be pleased to take you for a trial spin in it,” he added. “All right,” said Mr. Newrych; and they started. Everything went all right for about a mile, and then the machine gradually slowed down until finally they stopped. The manager jumped out and made an examination. “Wonderful, wonderful!” he ex- claimed. "What is the matter?” asked 3.1 r. Newrych. “Why, there’s no blessed engine on this car!” “Then what in the world has it been going on?”	* “Simply its reputation, sir-simply its reputation!” proudly replied the manager. ncurne ames orrance CHAPTER I. A DOUBTING THOMAS. 'LL day, while the westbound limited click-clacked across the level sweeps of Nebraska, he rode the observation plat- form at the rear of the heavy train. As the hours passed and the miles were flung back to the east, a frown deepened upon his tight-skinned face. His grumblings, which at first had been quite unintelligible, began to take audible form, the burden of their complaint being, "1 knew it! I knew it r He was a man of featherweight body, with a head that, by comparison, seemed abnormal. One glance at his garb and paraphernalia proclaimed him a “round- tripper’' of the summer-tourist class. He was dressed “according to Hoyle” -the Hoyle of the railroad folders-a Norfolk suit beneath his duster, a soft- collared shirt, a peaked cap with jockey visor. He carried everything that had e\er been recommended as useful on a transcontinental journey and some pre- cautionary equipment that was evi- dently self-inspired. One shoulder (COMPLETE IN THIS ISSUE) strap held a small camera, another crisscrossed his chest to suspend a long spyglass. He sat upon his o’.vn folding camp stool, a sure defense against the plat- form “hogs” that appealed to at least one of his more experienced fellow travelers. His eyes were protected by goggles; at his feet, neatly rolled, was a steamer shawl, which, with the ther- mometer frolicking at one hundred degrees above, seemed slightly incon- gruous, although not more so than the miles of snow fences which the railroad permits to stand on the windward side of the track throughout the long sum- mer. Nor was this all. Beside his privately owned folding stool sat a black box of mystery, lacking the slightest external hint of its contents. Across his knees rested a rifle case, its open flap indi- cating the first step of preparedness, but nothing to show whether it was carried for defense against train rob- bers or with the idea of pot-shooting big game. Upon this leather-clad ar- mament lay a “journal” in which he made occasional brief notations. The mystery of the black box ex- « THE UNCURRIED WEST 135 ploded when a white-clad figure ap- peared in the door of the club car and there issued from an ebon)' face, “First call for luncheon in the dining car!” The box held a compact lunch, com- plete even to a small thermos bottle of tea. The overequipped passenger need miss no scenic detail by waiting his turn in the dining-car line. Later in the afternoon other facts concerning him became evident by de- duction. The twang of the questions he put to the rear brakeman stamped his home range-Holyoke or Newton Center, or perhaps Augusta, Maine. His general eagerness, the innumerable picture post cards which he addressed and stamped, his careful study of map and time-table assured those who were watching him that it was his first trip West. But for the answer to his “I told you so”-set forth by the repeated and com- plaining “I knew it!”-we had to wait. The show-down came after darkness had fallen to make the electric-lighted club car more attractive than the dusty rear platform. His chair was next to the one I occupied. Suddenly he turned, and, without preface, put a question: “Isn’t it disappointing?” There was an eagerness to my'‘‘What disappoints!" born of the sort of thrill that comes when one is about to fit in the last chunk of a jig-saw puzzle. “The West,” he returned gloomily. “That depends on what you expected to find,” I ventured, recalling the in- cased gun and the spyglass, which might have been handed down in his family from the days when New' Eng- landers sailed clipper ships. “It’s not at all like. I’m telling you, stranger-not at all like.” "Like what?” He seemed to have an ingrowing mind, and the question was necessary. "Like the magazines and the movies paint it.” With that he was off for a flying start. The pent-up flood of his observ tion-platform repression was looser it1. His voice raised oratorically until the attention of the whole car was caught and the intensity of his arraignment held it. “I knew it,” he began. “In my heart and soul, I knew it before i started, but I just had to come and’see for myself. Now that I’ve seen, I’m going to show them up, those deceiving authors and actors.” Discovering that he had general at- tention, he paused to send a searching glance along the aisle between the padded chairs, perhaps in search of agents of deceit, then hurried on: “Just hark back a moment to the West they "put on printed pages and picture on the screen. Wild and woolly, isn't it? Cowboys and girls dash up to every station on prancing cayuses to meet every train, don’t they? Ropes swish out with snakelike hiss and towns are shot up pronto, aren’t they? The boys wear chaps-whatever they may be-and the girls carry six guns on every hip; isn’t it so in the magazines and movies? Buckboards and horse strings, longhorns and free range chuck wagons and wranglers, outlaws and sheriffs, wily squaws and scalp- trimmed bucks-oh, I’ve read and squinted until I’m up to snuff on the West they say that is.” “Maybe the West was like that once,” protested a fellow tourist, who per- haps had a friend who wrote ranch stories or had been introduced to some cow lady of the pictures. The incensed one sniffed. “That’s not the f>oint my friend they write and picture in the present tense theyd have us believe that their fake west is not was but it isnt as youd very well know if youd

passengers-tall upstanding youths with leather-tanned faces-and no won- der both wore chaps with fur on differing only in that one pair was white the other black both had re- volvers riding in holsters at their hips their shirts were of flannel and open at the neck their headgear which they quickly removed on noting the presence of women must have had the stetson brand inside there was the metallic jingle of spur rowels as their high-heeled boots trod the soft carpet of the aisle to two chairs near us is this yesterday or to-day i asked the recent protestant when he had ceased to gasp

crop of automobiles and widespread the barbed-wire fencing that the breed of the plains stock has greatly improved since the intro- duction of the morgan strain was strongly emphasized by the many beautiful mounts on exhibition clasped by the legs of gayly caparisoned riders the improvement showed too in the running time of the speed races and the relays which were participated in by both men and women but when it came to the bucking con- tests in which the punchers had oppor- tunity really to show their skill the morgan stock remained in the corral for there never will be harder fighting

expect the only concession made to the fair riders-and they did not ask that it was set down in the rules and regula- tions by the men managers-was that in the relay races they were not re- quired to change saddles as were the men nor did the names of their horses seem to bother them any more than did the outlaw spirit of the beasts there was one filly named morning-glory but the girl who drew

could tell by look- ing at them that they would swap their shirts for the chance to show again with every entrance came reels of excitement the outlaw was blind- folded under strenuous protest some- times not until teeth had been planted in twitching ears a saddle was thrown across an unwilling back and double cinched for the struggle that was to come then the contestant vaulted into the saddle

and fight in order not to be killed it is the same with one and all each one from the smallest to the largest has an enemy or enemies able to mas- ter them yes their lives are fraught with trouble but it is the law of the wild and they expect nothing else however it is of the life of red pan- ther we are telling-red panther who without doubt had as goodly a share of trouble in his varied career as any of the furred or the feathered or the finned his very entrance into the world was amid trouble when he and his little brother were born inside the dark deep cave in a crag of rock high on the moun- tain hi father was outside giving bat- tle to a grizzly bear with whom a long feud had been carried on and so the first noise that came to his little ears was one of strife the first sight that came to his eyes was one of battle moreover his sire holding the vantage point sent the bear retreating down the mountain with a sadly torn nose and peace prevailed tor the moment yet red panther always had a dim rec- ollection of knowing trouble before anything else later during the days when he was forced to lie still in the black cave and wait for his mother to come and feed him things were none too easy it was a hard lean grilling year and the crea- tures of the forest were hard pressed to obtain sufficient food to sustain life in their bodies consequently red panther and his little brother spent many weary hours many hungry hours waiting in the dark lair for their parent to return and give them the milk that would dispel their hunger still later through the period when the mother and father look the two lit- tle whelps out to learn their first les- sons of the hunt the youngsters had out of his element  no easy time of it they had to lie in wait silent rigid ever ready for hours and hours that in the end would bring them nothing then too there were various prowl- ers who were always on the lookout for such a tender and dainty morsel as a young panther cub ready to snatch them on the first bit of carelessness exhibited by either parent red pan- ther therefore had to be constantly on guard and he had it firmly instilled in him that when he was alone in the cave he was not to so much as breathe aloud red panther managed however to get through the very early days of his cubdom without serious mishap al- though many times danger had lurked close to him always he had used his brain watching learning remember- ing wisely realizing that he was see- ing things that would hold him in good stead in after life things that were in fact the very foundation of his exist- ence consequently there were few cubs with a quicker eye with a shrewder brain with a more nimble body he tracked and brought down his kill with such marvelous wile and valiancy as to cause a proud flutter in the hearts of his parents indeed there were few if any of his age who could equal him and then just as he was about to pass over the critical weeks where his par- ents help was so sadly needed in order to render him fit to stand completely on his own feet trouble and tragedy visited him with what might truly be termed a vengeance ii ded panther and his brother were out one day on the hunt with their father the other youngster growing bold insisted on occasionally darting off to follow what he thought a scent that he alone had discovered but red panther knowing full well that b tn it was wise to stay close to his parent made no such mistake the father was sorely tried to keep sight of the truant cub and several times he had to cuff him severely still he persisted on making little excursions of his own and it was on one of these that he met his fate quickly almost before he knew it a pair of fierce starving lynx made des- perate by hunger pounced upon him and tore him to shreds while he was making a single pitiful cry ordinar- ily they would have refrained from at- tacking a panther cub but it was a lean hard year and the situation was serious red panther always remembered the roar of rage that issued from the throat of his sire when he discovered the death of his offspring remembered the maddened leap he gave as he rushed through the forest to the fray it was a wild lightninglike bloody battle-the game panther bent on revenge fighting against two-to-one odds with a fury and a strength that almost made it seem as if he would come off the victor but finally the inevitable happened red panther through the trees saw the two lynx tear down his father and sever the jugular vein with wicked slashes for a time he stayed crouched behind a pine wide-eyed and krtowing that to show himself would mean in- stant useless death then when the fierce pair had walked off he slunk silently and carefully from his hiding and made his way back to the lair where his mother was waiting for a few brief days after this first tragedy he lived what was to him a peaceful gorgeous existence with his mother he prowled about the forest on the hunt enjoying fairly good luck and meeting with no danger to speak of the days seemed well-nigh perfect he was now progressing both men- tally and physically with surprising strides his body was lithe and grace- ful with perfectly proportioned mus-  top-notch magazine cles that were as lean and hard as steel his head was that of a fighter with alert ears sharp eyes dangerous fangs and a tenaciously punishing jaw he was nearly half again as large as any of his age and his fur seemed to have a darkish reddish tinge that would make him stand out against his ilk any- where yes red panther was as nearly a perfect specimen of his kind as one would ever see i el tmien black mogridge entered his life red panther playing before the lair with his mother suddenly had that instinctive feeling of danger close by springing to his feet at the same time that his mother drew back he caught a glimpse of a tall ugly black- bearded giant of a man ascending the tortuous trail to the den then before his mother could retreat or resort to strategy there was a flash of red fire a crackling noise and the big panther beside him toppled over with a shriek lying still and inert-dead red pan- ther as the man-creature came forward with a fierce cry of triumph and a wicked grim leer ran for the cave there was a hoarse laugh from out- side as the little cub flattened himself against the farthest wall of the deep cave then after the man had ascer- tained that there was no other mode of exit from the den there followed the extremely disagreeable process-to red panther at least-known s smoking out he caught a glimpse of flames lick- ing the entrance then they died down and thick pungent choking smoke filled the lair he shut his eyes and firmly closed his mouth yet he coughed and sputtered as the smoke came thicker he fought it stoically bravely but soon he had to give it up and with a valiant snarl and bared fangs he hurled his little body through the opening a stout club wielded by the brutal hand of black mogridge met him squarely between the eyes and he went down in a heap coming to he felt his hind legs roped together and saw that the man was in the act of doing the -ame to his front ones still he was game with a snarl he pulled his right paw loose bared his claws and with all the power of his sturdy body behind him he slashed out like lightning for that black-haired ugly face and drew his claws along the check and laid open the flesh to the bone but then with an imprecation the man struck him a terrific blow that stretched him out unconscious and nearly dead each bore the scars for life the man a jagged red tear along his cheek that made his face even uglier and fiercer the panther a deep rough gash where the hair never grew again di- rectly across his head so began red panthers slavery under black mo- gridge the renowned animal trainer tv dei panther from the day of his  captivity began a life that was to torture him black mogridge was a hard and cruel man a still harder trainer and still more cruel one a hu- man of the breed who really seem to delight in wreaking their vengeance on helpless animals without provocation he cuffed the little whelp kicked him clubbed him lashed him and did the youngster so much as snarl his anger or glare at him balefully after these beatings a still worse one was his por- tion having the unquenchable fighting blood in his veins red panther always battled the man back although he re- alized that it did no good every chance that he got he slashed out with his claws or snapped with his teeth down he would go beneath a heavy club and weakened though he was he would be up and after mogridge out of his element  almost instantly down be would go again-and up again so it would con- tinue time after time day after day until he was beaten and scarred but never broken then when he was a little older his master placed soft bulky things on his paws and made him stand on his hind feet and flail the air with his front ones every time he bit or snarled he was whipped unmercifully and given no food  every time he parried a blow and endeavored to deliver one in the same style he was gruffly compli- mented not beaten and given a plenti- ful meal finally realizing that he was com- pletely mastered-at least for the time being-he gave in to black mogridge and stood up on his hind legs and boxed for months it was all he did soon indeed he became highly profi- cient at the business even eliciting words of admiration from mogridge still through it all the deep intense hatred for the man never abated never left him several times he made at- tempts on the mans life always of course he was subdued for black mo- gridge was constantly on guard after a good half year of this daily training red panther one night found himself brought out in a larger cage than the one he had previously called his own and thrust in the bright daz- zling light before rows upon rows of people at first he was a trifle stunned a trifle puzzled as to what it all meant but then when his master entered the cage ordered him to put up his paws placed the gloves on him and com- menced to spar he realized that he was but meant to do his daily task then for perhaps a year this was red panthers almost nightly work sometimes daily and nightly he went through it all while before the crowd with absolute perfection in fact he afcnost liked it nevertheless when- ever he got the chance-or thought he had-he made another try for the throat of black mogridge always though the man got the better of him sending him down with a club and occa- sionally following it up with a light slash from the knife he always carried between them was that friction that undying hatred that would never be for- gotten for it was just as strong on both sides without doubt red panther re- membered the death of his mother and that first wicked blow without doubt black mogridge remembered the cause of that livid repulsive scar v dlack mogridge was a heavy gambler his band of trained ani- mals were a profitable thing for he was a man who knew animals and knew how to train them though his methods were usually unnecessarily brutal however with a large sum of money in his pos- session there always came to him the idea of doubling or trebling it and the quickest wa to him seemed a turn at the black and red wheel nine times out of ten he lost for he went ahead in a mad wild way there- fore he was frequently hard put to it to find enough money to make the next town the addition of red panther the only boxing panther in the world had meant much to him finan- cially nevertheless he one day found himself in a particularly tight place- a place where he simply had to get money or go completely under it was impossible to borrow it therefore he did something which he knew would hurt him financially in the future but which would save him for the time be- ing-he sold red panther to a travel- ing circus for he was the only animal that would fetch the necessary price and so it was that red panther left the slavery of black mogridge-at least for the first time a sequel to this story will appear in the next issue of top-notch complete in this issue paused a-ha chapter i professional troubles arl mephisto was walk- ing along a country road his battered suit case in one hand and his bag of tricks over his shoulder when he suddenly and exclaimed drawn up at the roadside near the edge of a wood were two automobiles of the kind known as fliv- vers there was a look of dilapidation about the flivvers but mephisto had once been a chauffeur and none knew better than he that a rusty hood often conceals a very capable motor any- how he was weary of the road and not in a discriminating mood the cars seemed deserted mephisto laid his burdens on the running board of one of the machines climbed into the tonneau pushed aside a bag of base- ball bats and with a sigh of content stretched himself out on the padded seat he would wait and rest until the owners of the cars returned and then he would beg a ride to the next town he dozed complacently his feet ele- vated to the back of the front seat the silence the warm morning and the lush fragrance of the countryside all con- spiring to make him forget his night in a straw stack the breakfast he had missed and his other troubles carl mephisto in real life was carl smedders but smedders was no name for an artist in sleight-of-hand smed- ders would do for a chauffeur but it was nothing to conjure with as a magi- cian the smedders was dropped for mephisto when carl became an uncle tommer and juggled trunks and prop- erties and barked like a bloodhound when eliza crossed the ice and came out in black clothes between the acts and took ribbons cannon balls and rab- bits out of a borrowed hat and held a shovelful of blue fire in the wings when little eva was shown welcoming ltncle tom at the pearly gates carl remained mephisto even now when a provincial sheriff had levied on the tent and the props and the com- pany had disbanded and gone its in- dividual and separate ways with or without money from home and with or without personal belongings involved in the writ of attachment carl was un- fortunate in having no home from which to secure a remittance but he was fortunate in dodging away from with red men and magic  the sheriff with the suit case and bag of tricks the stranding of the company had come to pass on the preceding satur- day now it was saturday again and for a whole week carl had worn out shoe leather on country roads and in country towns looking for some one any one who had a steady job for a man who could cover a cupful of bran with a handkerchief wave a wand say presto and turn the bran into a bunch of tissue-paper flowers no one seemed to want a magician however he had done a few tricks for meals off and on but the fare had been slim and barely sufficient to keep him going true he had been offered substantial remuneration for juggling cordwood into stove lengths with a bucksaw and for exercising his leger- demain at the steering wheels of cars of various makes and he had refused firmly when a man has mastered an art- he reasoned-he should take pride in it and not abase his gift to ignoble ends that the art was powerless to conjure a porterhouse steak out of an aching void made no difference with carl me- phisto if he starved to death and if his cmaciated frame was found crum- pled up in some highway clutched in his hands would be that useless bag of tricks-to which he had proved faithful to the end all very fine if one looks at it in the proper spirit suddenly carl dropped his feet from the back of the front seat and sat up all ears in the seat-behind what was it he heard from the depths of the wood an eerie note was being struck somewhere in the sylvan shadows it was like the distant beat of a drum- turn tum-tum turn tum-tum so un- usual was the sound that carl decided to investigate it he got out of the car and started into the woods but halted and turned back for the green felt bag chances could be taken with the old suit case but not with his stock in trade bag in hand he cautiously made his way among the trees guided by the tutu tum-tum whose mysterious staccato beat grew louder and louder in his ears at last he came to the edge of a glade and halted with a chill in his blood and a buckling of his nerves a lot of indians had a white man bound to a sapling and while one banged a tom-tom with his fist the rest of the redskins hopped a war dance around the helpless victim carl mephisto caught his breath and would have taken to his heels had not a weird discovery held him chained to the spot he knew the white man his name was hannibal bisbee in an old high hat and black frock coat he had played the role of lawryer marks in the late lamented uncle tom company bisbee was a melancholy person and consequently just right for a comedy part he had one object in life every- body in the company had known about that his wild soulful yearning was to distinguish himself in his home town to cut a dash in his native place and shine as a person of worth and ability who could do things if he set his mind to it and bisbee had tried for a year to compel the admiration of his home- folks only to have his budding ambi- tion nipped by the frosts of fate he had apprenticed himself to an aeronaut with the idea of startling his friends and neighbors by making bal- loon ascensions during home-coming week in derryville but two days be- fore the balloon was to be moved to derryville it had taken fire while being inflated and was completely destroyed after the failure of the balloon idea bisbee learned that a street-carnival company was to fill a fall engagement in derryville under the patronage of a local lodge of elks forthwith he joined the carnival aggregation and practiced a high dive for several weeks  top-notch magazine so proficient did he become that he could fall backward off a fifty-foot platform and drop in the exact center of a reservoir of water ten feet square this performance was warranted to make some splash in derryville but it never did the day before the com- pany was to unload at derryville liis- bee was kicked by an ostrich that formed one of the carnivals attrac- tions while the celebration was on in his home town bisbee lay in a hos- pital twenty miles away and bemoaned his hard luck a dozen times he tried to reach der- ry ville in some role or other that would compel the towns attention and a dozen times he was double-crossed by fate almost at the corporation limits of his native place it would have been discouraging to a man less purposeful than hannibal bisbee or to one with an object less inspiring topsy it was who had discovered that object she had passed the mighty secret on to st clair and he had confided it to legree and then iegree had peddled it to all the rest of the company everybody knew then that bisbee was in love and that he had a rival named golshaw and that golshaw as manager of the derryville white stockings was the apple of derryvilles eye and that bis- bees case was hopeless unless he could do something that would enable his per- sonal splendor to compete with gol- shaws the uncle tommers were to play derryville thus affording bisbee an- other of his numerous chances to back golshaw out of the king row but the company had gone on the rocks and again the bisbee fortunes had become the sport of adversity and of what adversity carl mephisto shuddered as he stood at the edge of the glade thought of bisbees past and watched the red men hop-hopping around to the eerie banging of the tom-tom all the indians wore baseball uniforms the white letters on their blue flannel shirts spelling apaches eight were dancing around bisbee each with an armful of firewood when a point in the moving circle came directly in front of bisbee a fagot was hurled upon the rapidly growing pile at bisbees feet mephisto was convulsed with horror it was necessary to do something for bisbee but what mephisto had an active mind he knew that indians are superstitious why not work upon that weakness in an attempt to save bisbee reaching into the bag of tricks mephisto brought out of it a long and slender sword dropping the bag he gave a loud yell and leaped clear of the bushes sword in hand he won the instant attention of the indians and their captive the red fist hung in the air above the tom-tom and the fagot bearers halted in their tracks straightened and whirled to an about face poor bisbee lifted his drooping head before them all stood carl mephisto a valiant figure his long sword shining in the morning sun the indian at the tom-tom threw aside that particular in- strument of torture and jumped to his feet eight bundles of firewood dropped on the ground nine red men started toward carl mephisto with war whoops then halted suddenly bunched together and stared in amazement mephisto had struck a pose had thrown back his head and was calmly swal- lowing the sword out in the road an automobile could be heard approaching honking and de- parting another indian also in uni- form pushed through the brush was that the machine moon gazer called bisbee a thrill of wild- ness in his voice ai answered moon gazer squaw and paleface make um shoot past in buzz wagon ai me-see um with red men and magic  why didnt you stop them why didnt you send them here ugh grunted moon gazer his startled eyes on mephisto me too busy watching paleface eat uni long knife wow injun git plenty fun this grass then bisbee barked something at mephisto that almost spoiled the sword trick say carl what in sam hill do you mean  whats the idea of but- ting in here like this mephisto withdrew the sword in haste and peered at bisbee in bewilder- ment the whilom lawyer marks pulled himself loose from the sapling disgustedly kicked the fagots away from his feet walked into the midst of the red men and leaned wearily on the shoulder of one of them why murmured mephisto i thought you were going to be burned at the stake i was going to do a trick with the sword get the indians inter- ested then chop through your ropes and make a run of it with you i- a steak or a chop boys exclaimed bisbee and all he did was to cook our goose whoever heard of such blooming luck  heap tough said the red men chapter ii with his plume on straight xhe idea was complex although the explanation was simple in bloss- burg six miles from derryville bisbee had unexpectedly met nick pender captain of the white stockings pen- der had told bisbee that golshaw in his roadster was to leave derryville for blossburg at ten oclock that morn- ing to secure an ex-league pitcher for the afternoon game with the roving apaches miss hattie ray was to ac- company golshaw just for the ride now nick pender had gone to blossburg to sound out the ex-league pitcher scanlon by name and see if he could be secured for the afternoon engagement scanlon had resisted the offers of the captain of the white stockings and the latter had called gol- shaw on the telephone scanlon was planning to leave blossburg on the eleven a m train and golshaw had phoned that he would pick up miss ray and be right over bisbee did not want the ex-league pitcher in the game against the apaches he might help the white stockings defeat the red men bisbee naturally was wildly eager to defeat his rivals team in order to delay gol- shaw and keep him from reaching blossburg until the eleven oclock train had departed with scanlon bisbee had staged that little play in the timber moon gazer had been sent to watch the road when golshaw and miss ray came by he was to halt them and beg them to intercede with hi redskin teammates for the life of bisbee the moment the manager of the white stockings and his companion left the roadster they were to be delayed until the local had left blossburg but carl mephisto in his ignorance had inter- fered with the plan and set it at naught moon gazer his attention di- vided between the road and the queer proceedings of mephisto had allowed the golshaw car to pass without a hail so scanlon would very likely be se- cured to pitch against the apaches this meant that the indians were in for the hardest kind of a battle mephisto was inclined to argue the case in his own defense golshaw was in a hurry he said and do you think for a minute bisbee that hed have stopped to save anybody let alone you  why man to have you eliminated by the indians would probably have filled golshaw with happiness if he had stopped for moon gazer at all at the report that you were in danger he would have shifted his gears into high and rushed on toward blossburg at top  top-notch magazine speed there was nothing clever about that idea of yours listen returned bisbee earnestly he would not have dared run away and abandon me hattie-he caught his breath on that loved name-w-as with him golshaw could not have shown the white feather with hattie beside him dont you see and hattie-is she- yes yes cut in bisbee wnldly shes the young lady of my dreams carl lie laid his hands on his heart and looked skyward soul fully shes the belle of derryville and has a hun- dred thousand dollars in her own right she finances the white stockings and golshaw must have been taking her with him to blossburg to pay over a good big retainer to scanlon and now-now mourned bisbee in great dejection the deal will be put through and the apaches will lose as manager of a losing ball team he asked sorrow- fully how can i hope for a smile for a kind word from hattie ray mephisto gave it up bisbee seemed to be milling around without much rhyme or reason perhaps bisbee could win a smile and a kind word from miss ray by defeating the ball team which she was financing and golshaw was managing but it looked dubious to mephisto success exclaimed bisbee thats all a lady thinks about when she con- siders a gentleman seriously if i read the signs aright golshaw will have all the success this afternoon better that declared mephisto than for you to show up with an in- dian ball team and defeat the nine of your own town being in love with a lady hannibal appears to play the deuce with a gentlemans reason oh you dont understand you dont understand  no i guess i dont certainly i dont understand how you happen to be connected with these red ball play- ers when did it happen and how this explanation also was simple the former manager of the apaches liad run away with all the money in debt to the players for two months sal- ary all around and owing a three days board bill at this zoological moment -to quote bisbee-the late lawyer marks arrived in blossburg with dis- couragement in his heart and a hun- dred good dollars in his pocket how he had saved the hundred from the wreck of the uncle tom company he did not explain but he had it-and that was the main thing-when he fell in with the forlorn apaches saturday the roving redskins were scheduled to play golshaws nine in derryville when bisbee learned that he went to the rescue of the apaches and became their manager the club owned the two flivvers the defaulting manager had failed to take one of them and had preferred to dig out of blossburg on a midnight train the cars were necessary as the apaches toured the country in them bisbee had planned to swoop down on derryville with his savages meet gol- shaw in the diamond lists and battle for the favor of his lady then he had met nick pender and had learned of golshaws attempt to secure scanlon to pitch against the apaches medicine chief the regular pitcher for the indians had heard f scanlon and was afraid of him tall timber the substitute pitcher was also afraid of scan ton both pitchers had refused to play in derryville if scanlon was in the opposing line-up from this in- formation mephisto learned how necessary it had been to eliminate scan- lon it seemed therefore as if there was to be no game in derryville that afternoon bisbee hardly had finished his ex- planations however when the supersti- tious notions of the indians allowed the with red men and magic   prospects to brighten heap big medi- cine said moon gazer addressing mephisto in awe you eat urn long knife some more huh  mephisto not only performed with the sword but went through his whole ibag of tricks the red men looked at each other in bewilderment grunted vvonderingly and then withdrew by themselves and held a powwow me- pliisto and bisbee watched from a distance you have made a hit with that bunch of wild ones carl averred bisbee ive an idea that something promising is to come out of that per- formance of yours i are all the players apaches me- phisto inquired i theres only one apache in the lot bind thats eagle feather-the chap with the flannel band around his fore- ead and the plume sticking up out of it from behind he plays center field ever man in that crowd has his little centricities take eagle feather for stance hes a phenom in the mid- le suburbs so long as his plume is on traight but if anything happens to the red band or the feather its a case f p-sticks until he gets his headgear ad- justed half a day the stocky lad over ere is our catcher he nails em too as big medicine or tall timber puts across but hes badly gun shy if any one happens to shoot during a me half a day drops everything and ns for his life then theres man in a hurry our ortstop bisbee went on a black t is warranted to make him take to the woods if two players on the team happen to have their off days in the same game medicine chief our twirler oes all to pieces and when the chief ets rattledlone wolf the captain and first sacker invariably halts the ime for a medicine dance they are an eccentric combination of poor los au right but if nothing rubs their su- erstition the wrong way the things they can do to a league ball are a cau- tion ah bisbee broke off suddenly here comes big thunder left fielder and silver-tonged orator of the clan he has a chance to orate and cant let it get past him big thunder had picked a red blanket off the ground from beside the tom-tom and looped it gracefully about his uniform and over his right shoulder he strode forward with dignity and halted close to mephisto and bisbee and facing them white brothers he said the braves of the diamond have counseled the palefaces are like sands on the sea- shore or like leaves of the forest in summer once the red men were many but now they are infrequent and only here and there we ball players come from our distant lodges into the pale- face country we are stout-hearted when the medicine is good when it is bad our hearts are weak scanlon is bad medicine our pitchers say so with scanlon against them our pitch- ers cannot wind up they cannot throw the ball they become like children afraid of the shadows but if sword swallower stays with us all will be well he has fine medicine our pitchers will be strong they will pitch against scanlon the paleface batters will not be able to hit them we want sword swallower and his medicine i have spoken hope was shining in bisbees face you hear that carl he asked how about a job with the apaches these boys have an idea that if luck goes against them you can catch their sal- aries out of the air dont say no begged bisbee you know how often i have tried to reach derryville with a specialty that would make the town sit up and take notice and how i have been backcapped foiled and double- crossed now at last j have the best chance yet surely you cant refuse top-notci magazine  all my future happiness swings in the balance what do i get tor being head medi- cine man for this redskin nine hanni- bal  queried mephisto anxious to help bisbee yet keeping an eye on the main chance twenty a week your transporta- tion board and lodging answered bis- bee promptly done said mephisto and right there the joyous war whoops of the indians rent the air and the triumphant echoes faded to silence in the distant woodland chapter iii some method in it ju ephistos first job as medicine man came within five minutes after a start had been made for derry- ville in the flivvers the leading ma- chine balked sputtered and came to a halt lone wolf captain of the nine handed mephisto the tom-tom and or- dered him to exorcise the evil spirit that was playing hob with the flivvers works mephistos old trade of chauffeur helped him in the emergency but to tinker with the car like a mechanic when he was supposed to remedy such troubles with the tom-tom and an in- cantation would have been fatal to his supposed powers he managed to combine the occult with the practical after he had opened the hood he banged the tom-tom and talked to the motor then he touched the carburetor jumped back banged talked and touched the carburetor again finally he closed the hood and calmly climbed into the car good work old scout said bisbee with a chuckle as the machine started off three miles out of derryville the third baseman young man who sits by the fire suddenly remembered that he had a charley horse he rose up in the tonneau of the second machine and brought both cars to a stop with a yell he wanted a treatment at once in fact he wouldnt go any farther to- ward derryville until the companys medicine man had put him in his old fighting trim  i can see where im going to earn that twenty a week muttered me- phisto getting out of the car the third baseman had started some- thing nearly every man in the nine suddenly discovered that he had a trou- ble that called for a little conjuring a cold lunch was served in the midst of the incantations and when the apaches finally resumed their journey toward derryville they had barely time to reach the ball grounds for the game when they drew within sight of the town a roadster passed them a man and woman on the seats and a husky fellow in gray uniform on the running board uhg grunted medicine  chief scanlon bisbee was breathing hard hat- tie he murmured and she never oce looked in my direction youll have her looking at you all right before the afternoon is over said mephisto i wonder if uncle jasper will be at the game went on bisbee appar- ently catching at one straw of hope as another failed him i didnt know you had an uncle jasper returned mephisto he is my only relative carl bis- bee continued he owns half of der- ryville i lived with him until he or- dered me out of the house and told me never to darken his doors again un- til i had distinguished myself somehow and proved that t amounted to some- thing oh how i have tried to get back here with a balloon ascension a high dive and an unde tom company just to show the old gentleman what i could with red men and magic  do if i set my mind to it now i have my chance mephisto was surprised i thought golshaw was the secret of your strug- gle to get back he said miss ray primarily corrected bis- bee but golshaw and uncle jasper in- cidentally my reasons for wishing to distinguish myself in my home town are comprehensive but the principal reason of them all is hattie from rising ground they gazed off over ihe village roofs and steeples a hungry pathetic light gleamed in bis- bees eyes he held out his arms to derryville at last he exclaimed tin coming back i never realized be- fore how lonesome i was for the old town theres uncle jaspers mill by the river and uncle jaspers business i block and uncle jaspers cement works and uncle jaspers bank and creamer and row of tenement houses and-and -carl and bisbee turned to his friend isnt it worth the effort of a mans life to make good in such a town  its worth a bigger effort to make good with uncle jasper seems to me answered mephisto what uncle jasper doesnt own be- longs to hattie said bisbee and me- phisto grew thoughtful and wondered if after all there might not be consid- erable method in the madness of ex- lawyer marks chapter iv to make it interesting phe apaches had a way of charging the players gate and spilling them- selves over a diamond that was cal- culated to send thrills through grand stand and bleachers and chills along the backbones of the opposing team they went to the fray like braves to the warpath filling the air with blood- curdling yells at derryville mephisto led the rush making big medicine with the tom-tom bisbee had counted on making a dramatic reappearance in the town the stage was set for just that sort of thing he galloped across the sward fearless in the midst of his howling aborigines presently he was to show his authority by lifting his hand in- stantly the bedlam would stop but proceedings went otherwise that after- noon on the derryville grounds chaske alias jim waterbury right field swung a bag of bats in front of bisbee and fouled his course bisbee stood on his head on the third sack and all his old friends and neighbors greeted the extempore performance with wild applause bisbee picked him- self up dusted his clothes and looked to see if miss ray was present she was his chagrin was touching but he manfully lifted a hand and brought the yelling to a stop scanlon warming up his mighty right wing turned to grin at the apaches it took more than a lot of war whoops to throw fear into his pro- fessional heart golshaw drew bisbee aside and talked with him for a mo- ment when their brief conversation was finished mephisto was surprised to see the two rivals shake hands lay- ing aside the tom-tom mephisto walked over to bisbee and inquired about that unexpected show of amity weve struck a bargain carl said bisbee in a quiver of happiness if the apaches win golshaw retires from the field in my favor if the white stockings win then i retire naturally returned mephisto picking a boutonniere out of the air casually and pinning it to his lapel one ball team has to retire in favor of the other when the games finished you dont understand if the apaches win then golshaw retires as an aspirant for the hand of miss ray  top-notch magazine and if the locals are the victors then vice versa with me  dont like the looks of scanlon whispered mephisto let us hope it wont be vice versa with you not a chance averred bisbee with confidence you have saved the day for the red nine with your bag of tricks just watch these indians thats all medicine chief was to pitch for the apaches he began tossing the ball to half a day with every show of calm- ness and confidence out on the dia- mond the snappy way the red men passed the ball around certainly dark- ened the skies of hope for golshaw the whistle blew the white stock- ings went out and the apaches came in the umpire announced the batteries peeled a white ball out of the box and flipped it to scanlon then scanlon proceeded to strike out half a day man in a hurry and lone wolf with a steadiness and ease that caused grand stand and bleachers to grow wild as lone wolf came over to the bench to drop his bat he looked om- inously at mephisto you no make um right kind of medicine he growled in a voice that made mephistos hair crin- kle why you let um strike out our men huh  you do heap better or catch um heap trouble then for the first time mephisto re- alized the responsibilities of his posi- tion but luck was on his side medi- cine chief fanned the first three to face him and the contest began to look like a real game lone wolf smiled and shook hands with mephisto as moon gazer picked up a club and took his position at the plate heap fine he said mebbyso you give um apaches two runs this inning huh  i believe ill make it two answered mephisto after a moments reflection whoop-a-la exulted the captain and went down to the coaching line as moon gazer singled and went to first like a comet chaske sacrificed medi- cine thief hit three times at nothing more substantial than thin air and young man who sits by the fire lifted a mighty one way out in the distant gardens brought moon gazer home and made a happy round of the bases i guess that will be all for this round lone wolf remarked me- phisto two next time huh the captain demanded ill think about it said mephisto just to make things interesting and give the crowd an idea theyre getting their moneys worth i believe ill let the white stockings bag a couple eagle feather went down on a pop- up gathered in by scanlon then nick pender got to medicine chief for two bases and bangs next man up like- wise doubled pender came home lohe wolf and medicine chief looked towrard mephisto and made trouble signs mephisto pounded reassuringly on the tom-tom and the next three white stockings were struck out flied out and put out at first during the work necessary to accomplish these outs however bangs stole home with the score two-and the diamond pro- ceedings looked more and more like a real ball game mephisto had been guessing remark- ably well the indians of course saw no guesswork in it at all before they went to bat in the first half of the third lone wolf demanded thr-ee runs of mephisto injun make um sword swallower eat bat all same long knife you no give um three runs the cap- tain threatened and held an ash club over the official medicine mans head just for that said mephisto reach- ing up to pull four bits in silver out of the end of the club youll not get a thing this round dont get ornery with me wolf or worse things than that will happen to the apaches lone wolf was cowed mephisto with red men and magic  may have seemed calm but in reality he was scared blue not until the cap- tain of the apaches had turned scowl- ing away did lie dare to draw a long breath according to forecast the poor los drew a goose egg in their half but the white stockings did no better in the half that followed lone wolf happened around and humbly thanked mephisto for holding the lo- cals in that handsome manner me- phisto waved his hand magnanimously and told him he was always glad to do what he could for a friend who showed a proper spirit the game rockcd along in a nip-and- tuck fashion until the last half of the seventh inning then the white stock- ings captured three runs and for the first time led in the scoring the black- board on the fence at the beginning of the eighth looked like this apaches  w s  the red men threw dark looks at mephisto but had reached a point where they were afraid to do any threatening or make any demands the eighth went by without a run for either side now if the white stock- ings could hold the apaches for the first half of the last inning all derry- ville could rejoice in a victory chapter v handy to have around pagle feather first up got a hit then big thunder got an- other right here with two on bases half a day came to bat a fearful al- most an agonizing silence settled over the spectators the indians seemed to be pounding scanlon all over the lot the prospect now had a hopeless look for the locals then a boy over on the bleachers ate the last peanut out of a bag inflated the bag and struck it with his open hand the result closely approximated the explosion of a firearm and in the stillness echoed loudly across the dia- mond half a day with a horrified yell dropped his bat and started like a deer for the distant fence some of the apaches started after him but the pur- suit was useless fear lent wings to half a days feet and he was over the fence and away before any of his team- mates could come anywhere near him tall timber the reserve pitcher went in to bat in half a days place he fanned and eagle feather and big thunder still roosted  the bases man in a hurry was the next apache to grab a club and confront scanlon golshaw leaned over the grand-stand railing and made a gesture to a man on the bottom row of the bleachers this man unobtrusively emptied the con- tents of a gunny sack into the ball field a black cat darted across the diamond a frantic cry escaped man in a hurry and he dropped his club to watch the somber streak fade into the outfield before man in a hurry could recover scanlon had put three pretty ones over striker out boomed the umpire eagle feather and big thunder still roosted on the bases medicine chief became rattled he began prancing up and down in front of the players bench and saying things in ute or piute or whatever it was the effect on lone wolf the next man up was distressing he sounded a call for a medicine dance the umpire gave him two minutes to face the local pitcher bisbee came out of the ob- scurity in which he had temporarily wrapped himself and begged his red captain to go on with the game but lone wolf would not listen eagle feather might have romped in during the excitement and at leat have tied the score but the white stocking on third plucked the plume from his red headband and eagle feather was out of it with two minutes gone scanlon tossed three balls over the plate and lone wolf was declared out the game was lost to the apaches  top-notch magazine and what of bisbee he felt as if lie had lost the world his one con- suming desire was to get out of der- ryville by the shortest route and never show himself in the town again carl mephisto also had a consuming desire and it was to get away somewhere by himself until he knew just how the indians were going to take their de- feat he was hustling around the end of the bleachers when he collided with bisbee they moved on together only to tind themselves suddenly confronted by golshaw dont be in a rush said the manager of the white stockings i want a word with you bisbee and i want a word with you flared mephisto you had the kid burst that paper bag and you had a hireling drop the black cat on the diamond and by your orders your third sacker snatched the feather out of the headdress of our base runner dont tell me all that wasnt a frame-up golshaw judging by his appearance was not in a triumphant mood he had in his hand a copy of the derryville evening times just from the press he turned on mephisto sadly guiltily pender found out all about the ec- centricities of your red nine while he was in blossburg golshaw admitted so i planned at the critical moment to start the boox to working well what of it what of it cried bisbee wrath- fully well it wasnt square it can- cels our agreement i dont have to retire from the field in your favor read that bisbee said golshaw pushing the newspaper under bisbees eyes and indicating an item in the col- umn of society news read that and i guess our agreement wront make much difference to either of us mephisto read the item over bisbees shoulder it was a small item but staggering tt announced that miss harriet ray was engaged to marry mr crittenden bolt of the well-known firm of bolt  blue haberdashers des moines bisbee reeled as from a blow between the eyes  never dreamed of such a thing averred golsliaw nobody in town ever dreamed of it i shall resign as man- ager of the white stockings and leave this part of the country forever he put out his hand and the two rivals of other days buried the hatchet then and there they had no ground for differences now well here you are it was a rasping voice and bisbee and mephisto whirled around a thin middle-aged gentleman with gray side whiskers was the speaker his small sparkling eyes were fixed on bisbee who fell back apparently overcome unc-uncle jasper he gasped yes uncle jasper was the crisp response at last hannibal you have done something worth while for the first time in years i have been interested in a ball game he took off his straw hat and displayed the battered brim and the loose crown in my excite- ment i destroyed this two-dollar hat he went on i never dreamed that i could forget myself so far hannibal i enjoyed the game and for the first time in twenty years i have laughed heartily come back to the old home boy you gave me this pleasant after- noon and i wish to reward you reward me asked bisbee exactly our butter maker wants an assistant mid you can go to work in the creamery to-morrow at sixty a month uncle shouted bisbee frantic with delight excuse me exclaimed mephisto and started off at a run lone wolf with all the apaches at his heels suddenly appeared in the offing they were on mephistos trail and he knew it although mephisto ran his best yet he was overtaken and with red men and magic cornered in an angle of the ball-ground fence you think um injun mad huh queried lone wolf naw half a day heap fool man in a hurry heap fool all injun nine heap fools we hold um council decide we want um isword swallower for manager you come with us huh we got plenty game to play plenty money in sight for the first time that afternoon mephisto had guessed wrong he ex- perienced a feeling of immense relief with hannibal bisbee reconciled to fate once more on good terms with uncle jasper and hooked up with the creamery as assistant butter maker  mephisto could accept the job of man- aging the apaches without supplanting anybody lpne wolf has a good heart spoke up big thunder he speaks with an honest tongue white brother the palefaces are many and the indians are getting scarce you are big medicine with my own eyes  have seen you take cigars out of an empty hat also eggs out of an empty bag you will be handy to have around will you take the job on a fifty-fifty basis ill go you said carl mephisto it is well my brother remarked big thunder lone wolf banged the tom-tom and the compact was sealed paradoxical pete by terrell love holliday arlse my countrymen to arms indignity must cease is manhood shackled by the charms of craven shameless peace in such a strain bloodthirsty pete from morning until night in offices upon the street declared we ought to fight one evening peter shouted hark the time for talk is past with lead well back the war dogs bark ive got him up at last selective service pete was called and unencumbered fit he had the chance for which hed bawled- to do his meager bit conscription is a crime said he this number-drawing plan is foolish why theyve drafted me im not a fighting man  a complete novelette dear me how very interesting which -who is he hes down on your books as rich- ard royce sir ive just made inquiry thais his right name too the nervy beggar hasnt even taken an alias as most of them find it convenient to do he has a job as a shop hand in the assembling department it isnt a posi- tion of great responsibility of course but just the same i thought it better to open vour eyes to the fellow s rec- ord hehas been out of sing sing less than six months did a three-year stretch for grand larceny-a matter of five hundred dollars that he helped himself to from his employers safe you are sure that he was justly convicted macomber inquired unquestionably sir kenney re- plied as a matter of fact he was caught with the goods on him and pleaded guilty in court it was that and the fact that it was his first offense which enabled him to get off with such a light sentence the detective paused chapter i  unsolicited information yen before his visitor said a word silas macomber sus- pected the nature of his er- rand although petersboro was more than fifty miles from new york it was not the first time that the head of the macomber machine shops had been honored by a call from a representative of the po- lice department of the great metropolis and recollection of those other experi- ences brought a grim almost hostile expression now to his rugged features well sir he demanded sharply what can i do for you you cant do anything for me mr macomber lieutenant kenney grinned the shoe is on the other foot i am here to do you a good turn -to put you wise to the fact that you have an ex-convict on your pay roll indeed said macomber with a trace of a sneer an ex-convict eh safe and sound  of course you didnt know that be was a jailbird when you hired him no i didnt know that he came here the other day looking for work and i took him on without asking any questions a glint came to the man- ufacturers eyes i am much obliged however for the information dont mention it returned the offi- cer you see i happened to be out here on another matter and i acciden- tally encountered him on the street coming jauntily along to work with his dinner pail in his hand the instant i set eyes on him i recognized him and i says to myself heres where i settle the hash of that bird you have a personal prejudice against him	 not at all the fellow never did me any harm but duty is duty and of course it wouldnt do to see a crook filling an honest mans job and not give his employer a friendly tip macomber sat for several seconds in silence regarding his visitor with a steady scrutiny which caused the lat- ter to feel somewhat uncomfortable you look like a pretty decent sort of chap the manufacturer remarked presently so did most of the other central-office men who have been here from time to time on errands of a sim- ilar character im blessed if i can understand it understand what sir the detec- tive asked frowning why some of you policemen should be so keen on keeping a man down why you should see fit to go out of your way to prevent a poor fellow who has made one mistake from having an- other chance the central-office man shrugged his shoulders i didnt go out of my way i told you that i ran into this fellow royce by accident in the circum- stances i deemed it my duty to warn you of course if you want to keep him in your employ knowing what you nb tn do about him mr macomber thats your own funeral and doesnt make any difference to me most employers would be mighty grateful though for being put wise macomber laughed i am going to tell jrou something kenney that may surprise you this young man you speak of isnt the only ex-convict who is working here for me at the present moment scattered among my help there are fifteen others fifteen yes some of them have been on my pay roll for several years and have climbed from the bottom of the ladder to positions of responsibility all of them are doing their work conscien- tiously giving me honest value for every dollar i pay them i gave them a chance here because i believe in the principle of live and let live and never in one single instance have i had cause to regret my decision the policemans face lighted up oh yes he exclaimed i remem- ber you now ive heard this shop spoken of at headquarters youre the gentleman who has been stirring up such a fuss about the way our prisons are run you would like to see the jailbirds served ice cream seven days a week and have a morris chair in every cell a chap with a penitentiary diploma is more welcome here than a college graduate he got up from his chair i apologize for having both- ered you sir if id recalled who you were at first id have known better than to waste my time coming here to give you the tip about young royce you can be sure that what you have told me about him is not going to prejudice me against him the owner of the machine shops declared frown- ing at the others irony of course not its more likely that ive given him a boost instead of a knock was the sneering response i suppose now that you know that  top-notcii magazine lies a jailbird he stands an excellent chance of promotion sixteen jail graduates working here eh suffering cats if  were in your shoes mr macomber id be mighty careful not to keep anything of value in the office safe with that bunch around- he broke oil suddenly as his gaze rested on a small safe in a comer ah i see that youre well protected in that respect you have one of the new phono-lock safes here a very wise precaution in the circumstances macomber scowled if you imag- ine that i installed that particular type of safe because i do not trust my em- ployees you are very much mistaken he declared angrily the owner of the patent happens to be a friend of mine and that was my only reason for selecting that model there isnt a man working for me no matter what his past in whose integrity i havent the most implicit confidence of course sneered kenney but just the same youre fortunate in hav- ing a safe here that has a phono-lock instead of the ordinary kind of com- bination even an ex-convict you know may turn out to be a crook and with this bit of sarcasm he took his leave chapter ii the turning point qecilie macomber visiting her father at his office a little later found him in no very pleasant frame of mind i am somewhat upset my dear by an interview i had half an hour ago with a detective from new york the old man explained when the girl in- quired what had disturbed him those confounded man hunters always get me stirred up when they come here to hound my employees and this fellow was particularly disagreeable cecilie frowned sympathetically which one of our men was he inter- ested in dad she asked an anxious expression on her pretty face no one that you know my dear a nice-looking young fellow who came here the other day seeking a job i hired him myself and put him to work in one of the shops he looked to me like a chap who had seen better days but there was nothing about him to sug- gest a prison past it was a great surprise to me when that policeman told me that he had been in trouble but of course that isnt going to count against him here certainly not the girl agreed then after a meditative pause  would like to meet him dad wont you please send for him her father was not at all surprised at her request nor did he misinterpret her motive cecilie in spite of her youth was as ardent and sincere a worker as he in the cause of prison reform and social uplift she took a warm personal interest in the careers of all the employees but particularly in those who had come to the factory with the shadow of the penitentiary hanging over them macomber pressed a button on his desk go to the assembling shop he said to the clerk who responded and tell mcpherson to send young royce to me the young man in overalls who came presently in compliance with this sum- mons certainly did not bear the appear- ance of one whose reputation was scarred honest and fearlessness seemed to be stamped on his smooth- shaven prepossessing countenance his clear blue eyes met his employers gaze unfalteringly you sent for me sir he inquired i wanted to find out how you were getting along macomber explained in a kindly tone how do you like your work  first rate thank you im afraid i am still a little awkward im not- safe and sound  er-i had never in my life handled a post drill until i came here i think i can conscientiously say that i am getting a little better at it each day in fact i have the foremans word for that his employer nodded approvingly youll soon get the hang of things theres no reason why in time you shouldnt make an expert mechanic just put all your mind into your work and dont let-er-anything else bother you by the way a man from new york came here to see me a little while ago-a police officer named kenney the young workman started i-to see you about me he faltered yes but dont be alarmed royce we judge men in this shop by what they are not by what they have been  dont worry about it at all i men- tioned the matter merely to let you know that you have nothing to be afraid of here thank you sir is that all you wished to see me about that is all royce except that while you are here i would like you to meet my daughter cecile who had remained in the background until now came forward and offered her hand to the new em- ployee-an act which brought a rush of color to his face i am very glad that you have come to work for my father mr royce she said pleasantly i am sure you will get along all right royce was about to make some re- sponse when sears the managing clerk came into the room i beg your par- don for disturbing you mr macom- ber he apologized but heres a message from one of our important cus- tomers in south america that proba- bly needs immediate attention unfor- tunately it is written in spanish and- carter being away sick-there is no- body here who can translate it youll have to send out and try to get hold of somebody said macomber frowning in perplexity at the docu- ment the managing clerk had handed him send to new york if neces- sary confound it why cant those people conduct their correspondence in plain united states if i can be of any service to you sir royce volunteered i can trans- late spanish you can eh where did you pick that up at business college a business-college graduate are you why didnt you mention that to me the other day i might have found a place for you in the office instead of in the shop i didnt suppose there was any chance of that the young man ex- plained smiling i inquired of one of the clerks and was informed that there were no vacancies in the office in the circumstances i was glad to get work -any kind of work-in the mechanical department macomber stroked his chin reflec- tively go out with mr sears and run off a translation of this message on the typewriter he ordered that incident proved to be the turn- ing point in royces position when he returned presently with his task sat- isfactorily performed he was offered a place in the office at twenty-five dollars a week a few months later macom- ber who had been watching his work and behavior closely and with growing appreciation called him into his room and asked him how he would like to become his private secretary at twice that salary i should like it first rate sir royce replied with a wistful smile but- er-as my duties would be of a more or less confidential character perhaps before i accept the promotion i had bet- ter tell you something about-about that visit of kenneys i shouldnt like to say- not at all his employer cut him  top-notch magazine short there is no need to go into that matter my boy as i told you when you first came here a mans past mistakes are not counted against him in this shop but it is only fair that you should know- not a word the kindly old man broke in with a reassuring smile not another word on that subject in the words of my favorite poet let the dead past bury its dead ill have your desk moved into this room and you start in on your new duties to-rnorrow morn- ing chapter iii the real reason in his new position royce made him- self so useful to his employer dis- played such rare initiative and rapidly acquired such a comprehensive grasp of the details of the business that grad- ually macomber learned to lean on him more and more inside of a year he was drawing a bigger salary than any other employee and was treated by the clerks in the outer office with almost as much deference as the boss himself as a crowning mark of his confi- dence macomber took him to new york one day and introduced him to the manager of the phono-lock safe company i want you to make a record of mr royces voice he told that official although the small safe in my private office contains only my personal papers i want him to have the power to open it in case of emergencies royce who had gone there in igno- rance of what his companion had in mind looked at him in astonishment surely that is not necessary sir he protested in an undertone you have already given me the combination of the big safe in the outer office if as you say the small safe in your room contains only your personal effects and has nothing to do with the business  by should i have the power to open it in fact-he hesitated-while of course i deeply appreciate the compli- ment i dont-i would rather not have the privilege why not my boy because it is just possible that some- thing might be stolen and in that event i-you would naturally suspect me  ou know i made the same objection when you insisted on giving me the combination of the big safe but as there were business reasons why i should accept tht responsibility  allowed my- self to be persuaded this case how- ever is different you need not worry on that score his employer reassured him there might be a chance of somebody getting hold of the combination of the big safe and robbing it but with the phono-lock that would be absolutely impossible wouldnt it mr deeming absolutely impossible the mana- ger of the safe company echoed smil- ing we positively guarantee that no- body but the persons whose voices are recorded on the steel disk can open one of our safes except by violence even though a thief knew the countersign it wouldnt do him any good onlv the original voice or voices from which the record was made would release the mechanism perhaps you are not ac- quainted with the principle on which the phono-lock works mr royce i have only a hazv idea of it royce admitted do you mean to tell me that anybody who knew the countersign and was a clever mimic could not success- fully imitate the voice of the owner it could not possibly be done deeming declared positively it is a scientific fact that no two human voices are exactly alike they may sound identical to the untrained ear but a careful comparison of the respective records of the vibrations always reveals marked differences and the mecha- nism which operates our lock is con- safe and sound  trolled entirely by the thin wavy line which is practically a vocal signature of the owner of the safe-a signature that could not be forged in our recording department to which i shall presently take you mr royce he continued is an ingenious contrivance consisting of a tiny mirror on the needle of a phonograph when the person whose voice is to control the combination speaks into this instru- ment the mirror throws a ray of light up or down with each vibration of the needle and its movements are thus re- corded on a photographic film unrolled before it at a certain speed in this way we get a perfect record of the voice vibrations which is later engraved on a steel disk and installed in the mechanism of the phono-lock on the outside of the safe as you are of course aware is the mouthpiece of an ordinary telephone transmitter attached to its diaphragm is a delicate needle the other end of which rests on the groove of the steel disk which bears the countersign when this countersign is spoken into the safe by the same voice which made the rec- ord the vibrations of the needle coin- cide with the record on the disk and a continuous electric contact is made which when completed releases the mechanism and causes the massive door to swing on its hinges royce nodded i see he said and if any odier voice but the right one were to speak into the transmitter the vibrations not being exactly the same would fail to make the electric contact  thats the idea the manager laughed you understand now how groundless is your fear of being made the scapegoat of somebod elses dis- honesty  yes i guess i should be thoroughly protected royce assented i must confess that always until now i looked upon your lock as somewhat of a freak not knowing exactly how it worked i scarcely could believe that it was really and truly as safe as it was sound macomber grinned at the little pun nov that the invention has been ex- plained to you my boy you have no objection to sharing the combination with me he asked not if you really wish it sir but if youll pardon me for saying so i still fail to see what is to be gained by it what have i to do with your pri- vate affairs nothing of course but if i were to die suddenly or were to be stricken dumb it would be necessary as the combination now stands to blow the safe open in order to get at its con- tents perhaps i am seeking to guard against those contingencies but you told me the other day that miss macomber has the combination yes that is so my daughters voice is on the disk macomber laughed well my boy if you must have the real reason it was cecilie who suggested my taking this step he glanced toward the manager of the safe company who was engaged just then in talking with a subordi- nate she wants you to know how implicitly we trust you he continued in an undertone laying his hand on the young mans shoulder i keep several thousand dollars in negotiable securities locked in that safe royce we want you to feel that we have such confidence in your integrity that we are not a bit afraid to give you access to them chapter iv acainst expectations ecilies suggestion that royces voice record be added to the com- bination of the phono-lock safe was by no means the first indication the girl had given of her great personal inter- est in her fathers confidential man  top-notch magazine the development of their friendship had kept pace with royces rapid pro- motion at the machine shops in cor- dial sympathy with her philanthropic work among the families of the men on her fathers pay roll he had eagerly volunteered his services and had soon made himself as indispensable to her in her sociological activities as he was to her father in the running of the busi- ness already he was beginning to dream dreams in which his employers attrac- tive daughter played a star part and for a time there was certainly nothing about cecilies attitude toward him to discourage him in his agreeable pastime of constructing aerial castles then suddenly the girls manner ab- ruptly changed she discontinued her frequent visits to the office which ob- viously had been largely inspired by his presence there and whenever they met she treated him with such cold formality that a much less sensitive per- son than he could hardly have escaped the conclusion that he was being snubbed this sudden change in miss macom- bers attitude naturally puzzled royce greatly he pondered over everything that he had done seeking to find a reason for it but finally gave it up in despair of course he reflected it was quite impossible for him to seek any explanation from the girl one evening a few weeks after royces visit to the office of the safe company a glum-looking pale-faced young man in blue jumpers entered macombers private office at sight of him the head of the ma- chine shops grinned in that outfit i can almost forget that you answer to the name of reginald st john van- diveer he remarked chuckling of course it never was really fair -to hold that against you but i couldnt help being prejudiced he patted his vis- itor encouragingly on the shoulder how do you like your job my boy young vandiveer scowled if you want a frank answer i dont like it at all he declared sullenly surely that doesnt surprise you it is hardly to be expected i think that a man brought up as i have been would enjoy putting in eight hours a day handling a beastly greasy drill in company with a lot of coarse uneducated laborers the work itself is degrading enough but the associations are even worse and the insults and abuse of that vul- gar ruffian of a foreman are really a bit more than any gentleman could tolerate how do i like the job he laughed bitterly well now mr ma- comber thats what one might call rub- bing it in a glint came to the elder mans eyes so youre going to quit eh  he asked you dont intend to stick it out oh i didnt say that the vandi- veers are not the quitting sort if you insist on my going through with this -er-this disagreeable experience be- fore you will give your consent to my marrying cecilie i shall go through with it no matter how painful and humiliating i may find it cecilie is well worth the sacrifice but couldnt you be reasonable sir and change the conditions a bit give me a position of some sort here in the office instead of outside in that beastly shop and ill soon satisfy you that im not afraid of hard work macomber grinned and shook his head the man who marries my girl has got to take my place here some day he said quietly he has got to have a thorough knowledge of the business and the best place for him to acquire it is out there in the shops if youre afraid of grease and grime reginald and are ashamed to wear jumpers i reckon you dont quite meas- ure up to the specifications of the son- in-law im looking for safe and sound  it isnt the grease and grime van- diveer protested scowling or these confounded togs either it is the sur- roundings that i find so disgusting- the disagreeable company into which you have thrust me why i under- stand-i can hardly believe it but i have heard the same thing from sev- eral sources-that some of those wretches with whom i have to rub shoulders are actually criminals- rogues who have seen the inside of a prison is that really so mr macom- ber  the old mans face darkened he glanced apprehensively toward royce who had sat at his desk throughout this conversation apparently engrossed in some business correspondence yve have no criminals or rogues working here vandiveer macomber said sharply some of my people- several of them-have been in trouble ye dont hold that against them in this shop any more than we hold it against you that you are afflicted with the name of reginald st john there is one thing that we do hold against a man however he continued angrily it is a rigid rule of this concern that any person employed here who is proved guilty of making a slur- ring remark about the past of any of his fellow workers shall be instantly discharged that rule goes for you too young man ill overlook your offense this time but be careful that it does not occur again after vandiyeer had gone out ma- comber turned with a grin to royce what do you think of my future son- in-law he asked the younger man hesitated if he is miss macombers choice i guess he must be all right he answered dif- fidently she wouldnt-she usually shows good judgment cecilie likes him pretty well his employer remarked frowning but as a matter of fact hes more her mothers choice than hers he has been calling steadily at the house for the past few weeks and he has made a great hit with mrs macomber what she sees in him i cant imagine he has got a college education and a family tree but apart from those fancy trim- mings he looks to me like a total loss royce could readily understand why the possession of a family tree would be a big point in vandiveers favor so far as mrs macomber was concerned that lady he knew was not at all in sympathy with her husbands and daughters democratic views and frowned on their sociological work she was the leader of petersboros up- per ten and the great fear of her life was that her daughter would make the mistake of marrying beneath her how does miss macomber feel about it  royce asked somewhat anx- iously does she-has she-decided to marry him  well theyre not engaged yet ce- cilies father answered whether they will be or not will depend largely on how he makes out here my daughter is in full sympathy with my plan to test his mettle by putting him to work in the shop she believes hell make good but i have my doubts the old man grinned as a matter of fact i have a hunch that hell quit cold be- fore hes been working here a week macomber was mistaken however to his great astonishment vandiveer stuck resolutely to his humble job in the assembling shop and before many vveeks had passed the head of the con- cern got excellent reports concerning him from mcpherson the foreman hes the biggest surprise that has ever been handed to me sir mher- son declared the first day he wasnt worth the room he took up and was in fact if youll excuse my saying so a nuisance to have around but the second day he came down and pitched into his work as if he had been used  top-notch magazine to it all his life and he has been going at that gait ever since i cant say that hes the most cheer- ful worker on the premises the fore- man continued theres a scowl on his face all the time and he never has a word to say to any of the other hands treats them all as though they was be- neath his notice but apart from that theres certainly no fault to be found with him chapter v unwilling to explain jpor six months vandiveer continued to make good he disliked his work almost as much as he did his fel- low workers but one of his ancestors had battled and bled at bunker hill and some of that heros fighting blood flowed in this young chaps veins- enough of it to sustain him in his strug- gle to qualify as macombers son-in- law the old man shifted him from one department to another so as to give him a varied experience in the mechanical end of the business and receiving fa- vorable reports from all the foremen under whom he worked finally ad- mitted to his wife and daughter that he had made a mistake in his original estimate of cecilies suitor im broad-minded enough to ac- knowledge when im wrong macom- ber told them theres much more to reggie than i thought i cant say that his disposition makes a hit with me but then its you thats marrying him cecilie not i so long as he has convinced me that hes no quitter and isnt afraid of hard work im satis- fied to leave the rest to you and mother then they-we can formally an- nounce the engagement mrs macom- ber asked eagerly her husband frowned meditatively well i wish you would wait a little longer before you take that step my dear he requested just a few months more to-morrow im going to put reginald to work in the office so that ill have a chance to watch him and see what kind of a head he has for business you know im getting to be an old man he added smilingly and it probably wont be very long before it will be up to my son-in-law to run the shops nonsense dad cecilie protested youve many good years ahead of you yet why you dont look a day over thirty-five you ridiculous man but when-when that time does come i am confident that the business will be safe in reginalds hands he is really very shrewd-even though he doesnt look it besides he will have mr royce to help and advise him macomber nodded with rayces help he may make out all right he said then after a long pause if only you were marrying roycfc my dear instead of that other chap then i would have no reason to fear that the business to which ive devoted the best years of my life would be run on the rocks he regarded the girl wist- fully from under his shaggy brows do you know i had an idea at one time that you were becoming rather fond of richard until- the idea  mrs macomber cut in indignantly cecilie marry that man how could you suggest such a terrible thing silas why you have admitted yourself that the fellow is an ex-con- vict what difference does that make her husband rejoined frowning so far as cecilie and i are concerned the young mans unfortunate past wouldnt count against him he looked keenly at his daughter you wouldnt refuse him on those grounds eh my dear the girl hesitated why discuss the subject she returned evasively mr royce has never asked me to marry him safe and sound  and if he had her fathers keen eyes looked searchingly into hers if he had i-i am afraid i should have been compelled to refuse him dad because of his past again cecilie hesitated yes-be- cause of his past she answered pres- ently a queer inflection in her tone mrs macomber warmly expressed her approval but her husband looked dum founded great scott  he exclaimed and this from you of all persons after all my efforts to broaden your mind to teach you to judge people by a more christian standard of human values than most of the world employs you turn out to be as narrow as the rest of them the old man laughed bit- terly so all your enthusiasm for up- lift work has been a sham  cecilie winced that is not so father she protested i am thor- oughly sincere in my work when i say that mr royces past would make a difference i dont mean that the fact that he had been  jail would count against him what then macomber inquired with a puzzled frown cecilie paused reflectively he- there is something i dont care to ex- plain just now she replied and her father was unable to get any further information from her on the subject chapter vi a point-blank refusal wandiveer discarded his blue jumpers without regret the next morning and began his final term of probation in the office of the macom- ber machine shops a third desk was installed in macombers own room and the new arrival was assigned to assist royce in a clerical capacity and ad- vised to keep his eyes and ears open and absorb as much as he could of the latters business methods again his prospective son-in-law proved an agreeable surprise to ma- comber he soon made it apparent that he had a good head for business and in several instances when his employer tested his judgment by consulting him in matters which came up for consid- eration his responses satisfied the old man that he had initiative and clear- sightedness true his demeanor toward the clerks in the outer office was overbearing and his attitude toward royce-whose well- meant efforts to teach him the ropes he haughtily resented-so insolent that macomber on several occasions was compelled to remonstrate with him macomber however was hopeful that in time and with cecilies assistance these defects in his character might be toned down i think hell do all right the old man told his wife and daughter one evening- to-morrow as a final test i am going to take him to new york and have a record of his voice made for the phono-lock safe a final test mrs macomber echoed arching her eyebrows a test of his trustworthiness her husband explained i dont as a rule approve of leading men into temptation but in this case where our little girls happiness is concerned i consider the experiment justified mrs macomber frowned surely you dont question reginalds integ- rity she asked indignantly that is absurd it is an insult silas even to suggest the possibility of his taking advantage of your confidence her husband shrugged his shoulders ive got to be sure that hes an honest man before i trust our girls future to him he insisted he knows that there are over fifty thousand dollars worth of negotiable securities in that safe i took care to bring the fact to  top-notcii magazine his attention i have been making in- quiries and i find that in spite of the airs he gives himself and the bluff he throws he is dependent almost en- tirely on the small salary im paying him of course  dont hold that against him my son-in-law doesnt have to be a rich man but he has got to be on the level as if reggie could be dishonest mrs macomber murmured probably not macomber assented but if there should be a crooked streak in him it would be very likely to show itself if those fifty thousand dollars worth of bonds were put within his reach we shall see how he acts when he has the combination of the phono- lock but vandiveer was not put to that test when macomber told him of his intentions the next morning without of course explaining the real motive behind the offer he refused point-blank to have his voice recorded on the steel disk whats the idea his prospective father-in-law inquired in astonishment vandiveer shrugged his shoulders if i were to give you my reasons he said with a contemptuous glance to- ward royce i am afraid i should be breaking one of the cardinal rules of this office all i will say therefore air macomber is that although i have no doubt that you intend it as a com- pliment my self-respect will not permit me to accept the honor with mrs macomber however when he called at the house that eve- ning he was more explicit of course your husband meant well enough he told her but the idea of his asking me to share such a responsibility with a fellow who has worn prison stripes really that was going a bit too far as a matter of fact that upstart royce has been getting on my nerves ever since i went to work in the office to have to play second fiddle to a jail- bird has gone decidedly against my grain you have my sympathy dear boy returned cecilies mother i too have no liking for that man royce i al- ways have predicted that silas is going to be very sorry some day for giving him so much of his confidence chapter vii a changed opinion week before christmas mrs macomber again brought up the subject of the formal announcement of her daughters engagement to reginald vandiveer the poor boy has been on proba- tion long enough she told her hus- band it is preposterous and unfair to keep him waiting any longer i am sure he is entitled to great credit for the patience he has shown in enduring your ridiculous tests now that you have satisfied yourself that he has busi- ness ability and is not afraid of hard work what more can you reasonably ask i would like to announce the en- gagement at the dinner table on christ- mas day i am inviting quite a large party macomber glanced inquiringly at his daughter howr do you feel about it little girl  he asked cecilie hesitated i dont think we had better announce the engagement just yet she replied im not-i want a little more time mother to make up my mind a little more time her mother echoed with a rising inflection good heavens surely my child after all the sacrifices the dear boy has made for you all the hours of slavery he has endured in that horrid shop for your sake you are not thinking of re- fusing him the girl frowned dubiously i dont know mother in some respects reginald has more than come up to my safe and sound  expectations but frankly there are sev- eral things about him which jar me i appreciate the efforts he has made to please dad on my account and for that reason and the fact that you are so keen on my marrying him i am trying my best to see only his good points but i-you mustnt ask me to decide just yet her father looked at her shrewdly by the way he remarked talking of christmas dinner reminds me that i am thinking of asking young royce to spend the day with us he is all alone in petersboro you know and- youll do no suchthing silas mrs macomber cut in an angry glint in her eyes you can turn your place of business into a refuge for ex-con- victs if you wish i have nothing to say about that but i positively set my foot down when it comes to receiving any of your jailbird proteges in my home her husband scowled and cecilie looked at her reproachfully mr royce isnt- the latter began then abruptly checked herself surely the christmas season is hardly the time mother to entertain such prejudices she protested christmas season or any other time no man with a prison record is going to sit at my dinner table mrs ma- comber declared and of all the ex- convicts employed in your factory silas i particularly dislike that man royce i dont believe that his refor- mation is sincere i am sure that sooner or later you are going to regret bitterly the day that you put him in a position of such responsibility macomber dismissed this prediction w-ith a laugh a more trustworthy high-minded young man than dick royce never lived he declared loyally if you wont let me invite him here for christmas i suppose that settles it youre the boss of this shack my dear and with that the discussion ended late in the afternoon of christmas eve cecilie came down to the factory in her electric runabout to call for her father she found him alone in the office vandiveer had left town the day before to spend the holidays with his parents in boston and royces desk wtas also vacant dick went to new york to spend christmas with some friends macom- ber explained his keen eyes observing the girls wistful glance toward the young mans unoccupied chair he had to catch a train and left early if you had been here five minutes sooner you would have seen him hes only just gone the old man went to the safe with the intention of taking out his christ- mast gifts to his wife and daughter a few seconds later cecilie heard him give vent to an ejaculation of mingled astonishment and dismay he was kneeling before the open safe staring dazedly into its interior what-is anything wrong the young woman asked anxiously macomber laughed grimly as he got to his feet who would have thought it he exclaimed then he turned quickly to his daughter you say your car is outside good let us hurry there may yet be time to catch him at the station catch whom mr royce good heavens dad-surely you dont susoect that- i dont suspect-i know macom- ber cut in huskily the bracelet i bought for you the necklace for your mother and over fifty thousand dol- lars in negotiable securities are miss- ing only royce could have taken them i would like to give him the benefit of any possible doubt but un- fortunately in this case there cant be any doubt great scott i would have given every dollar i possess sooner than have this happen they caught royce at the railway  top-notch magazine station just as he was about to board a train he vehemently denied that he was guilty i have never in my life opened that safe he declared although you in- trusted me with the combination  have never made use of it ill be hanged if i can understand this tiling mr ma- comber but i swear it wasnt my count- ersign that worked the lock his employer shook his head it is no use royce  am positive that t locked the safe all right the last time i was at it and the combination was in perfect working order when i opened it to-day so it couldnt have been tampered with he paused  perhaps i am partly to blame myself for having put temptation in your way at all events i am disposed to be lenient if you will confess your wrongdoing and restore what you have stolen i shall not prosecute it rests entirely with you whether you get a chance to make a fresh start or whether you-eat your christmas dinner in a police-station cell royce glanced wistfully at cecilie im sorry he said quietly but if thats the only alternative then im afraid its the cell for me chapter yill  a new twist in thecase ix spite of macombers efforts to avoid publicity the news of koyces arrest reached the new york press and the christmas day issue of the morning papers contained a brief telegraph re- port of the incident police lieutenant kenney of the new york central office read that rc- porl with interest and although the case was outside of his jurisdiction de- cided to apply for a short leave of ab- sence in order to give it his personal attention early the next morning he visited the new york office of the phono-lock safe company and had an interview with deeming the manager the lat- ter went minutely into the details of the construction of the device unscrew- ing a plate from the interior of a safe in order to make his explanation of the mechanism perfectly clear then he showed the sworn reports of a hun- dred exhaustive tests which had satis- fied a jury of experts that the lock could not be successfully tampered with and thoroughly convinced the po- lice officer that only the original of the voice or voices engraved on the steel disk could operate the mechanism of the combination that settles it said the detective smiling as he rose to leave as a matter of fact mr deeming i was pretty well convinced before i came here we have never had a case at headquarters where your safes had been tampered with but i thought it best to make absolutely sure before i went any further in my present inves- tigation later that day he arrived in peters- boro and entered the office of the ma- comber machine shops i have come to look into the robbery he announced macomber did not receive him very graciously i should have thought the local authorities could have handled the matter themselves without calling in the new york police he grumbled the case is a very plain one unfor- tunately there isnt any mystery about it he stared hard at his visitor youre the detective who came here some time ago to warn me about young royce arent you he continued scowling i suppose youre feeling rather good over the unfortunate fel- lows downfall  kenney shrugged his shoulders will you kindly open the safe for me he requested the first thing i would like to do is to examine the mechanism macomber obediently went over to safe and sound  the safe and spoke into the transmit- ter amen-amen he enunciated softly and at the final syllable there was a responsive click and the massive door swung open the police officer took a screw driver from his pocket unscrewed a plate from the steel box which inclosed the mechanism as deeming had shown him and proceeded to detach the metal disk on which the countersigns were re- corded who else has the combination be- sides yourself and the man you ac- cuse he asked examining the thin wavy lines on the steel through a lens only one other person-my daugh- ter and she of course is above sus- picion the old man scowled again that question is unnecessary as it is insult- ing he rejoined hotlv i beg your pardon the detective apologized a case of this sort has to be looked at from every angle he again made a close examination of the disk with the aid of the glass you are sure there are only three counter- signs he asked presently there seem to be four here no there are only three macom- bers face suddenly lighted up oh  know what you mean the fourth impression is another record of my own countersign-for use over the tel- ephone ah that sounds interesting ex- claimed kenney so you can open this safe without being on the spot macomber nodded it can be opened by putting the receiver of the telephone right in front of the transmitter on the lock he explained at the time i bought the safe mr deeming the manager suggested that i might as well put in that additional countersign as it might come in useful some time he explained that the voice vibrations being different over the wire an extra record would be necessary in order to work the combination at long range more because the novelty of the thing appealed to me than because i had any serious intention of making use of that rather freakish feature of the lock i took his advice but since we tried it at that time i have never had any occasion to use it the detective looked at him keenly you are quite sure mr macomber that you have never worked that com- bination over the telephone  he asked i have already told you that i have never had occasion to do so was the impatient response kenney lapsed into a thoughtful si- lence where were you on the night before the robbery wras discovered he asked presently part of the time at my club and the rest at my home you have a telephone at your house of course but really i fail to see the idea of this line of questioning sir it may lead to important results the police lieutenant assured him with an odd smile did you use your tele- phone that night did vou call up anv- body to the best of my recollection i did not but somebody called me up at the club-a young man employed here in the office that however has nothing to do with this unfortunate case his visitor did not seem to be w ill- ing to take that for granted what was said over the wire he asked nothing of any importance yan- divcer-thats the young man who tel- ephoned-was going to boston to be with his folks over the holidays he called me up at nine oclock to bid me good-by i hardly know what made him do that for he had already said good-by at the office before he left in the afternoon but i guess he was feel-  to p-notc m ag a ne ing pretty good his voice sounded as if he had been taking in a little prema- ture holiday cheer the old man grinned im sure this in formation must be of great value to you it may prove of more value than you imagine kenney rejoined where is vandiveer now he is in boston he intends to remain there until the end of the week will you be good enough to give me as accurate a report of your con- versation with him over the wire as you can recall the detective re- quested macomber complied and observed with amusement that his visitor ap- peared somewhat disappointed by his recital you are quite sure that was all that passed between you die detective asked that was all except that he wished me a happy christmas and i wished him the same was the ironical re- sponse ah exclaimed kenney after a pause thats a little better one thing more mr macomber will yoube good enough to give me the home ad- dress of your night watchman-the man who was on duty last night on receipt of this information he de- parted but a couple of hours later he again visited the office his face now wore a complacent expression where was vandiveer supposed to be when he telephoned you that eve- ning he began abruptly at the railway station at least i understood him to say that he was call- ing up from there while waiting for his train kenney laughed he was misin- forming you he was here in this oitice at the lime i have interviewed your night watchman he tells me that mr reginald vandiveer came back here about nine oclock-the time you say he called you up at your club be- ing employed here and an intimate friend of your family it was an easy matter for him to enter these premi es without arousing the watchmans sus- picion macomber frowned what on earth was he doing here so long after closing hours he exclaimed he told the watchman that he had come to get a christmas present that he had left in his desk said kenney with a grin but of course his real motive in coming here was to rob the safe he rob my safe why that is out of the question he didnt have the combination i had offered it to him as a matter of fact some time before but he refused to have his voice put on the record the detective laughed neverthe- less he succeeded pretty well mr ma- comber-with your assistance my assistance the old man cried angrily what nonsense is this are you daring to accuse me sir of being an accomplice to the robbery i am kenney replied i am not saying that you were a willing accom- plice but-mr macomber will you be good enough to repeat the exact re- sponse you made to vandiveer when he wished you lhe compliments of the season over the telephone i wished him the same but- you said the same to you my boy and many of them didnt you those were the very words you used   of course macomber admitted frowning that is the conventional response that anybody would have made in the circumstances but what has that to do with the robbery of my safe the other grinned mysteriously ill wager a new hat that he made you repeat the sentence he remarked he didnt seem to catch what you said the first time eh  now that you speak of it i believe safe and sound  that did happen but really sir i fail to comprehend-- i knew it the detective cut in with a triumphant laugh mr macomber we are now going to conduct an in- teresting little experiment will you be good enough to go to the safe and speak those words into the transmitter -the same to you and many of them  macomber grudgingly complied he became indignant when no perceptible result followed and demanded to be informed if his visitor was trying to make a fool of him certainly not kenney reassured him our experiment is not quite complete yet try it once more please with a shrug macomber obediently started to repeat the sentence but be- fore he got to the last word he stopped short with a startled exclamation as the word many left his lips there was a responsive click from within the mechanism of the safe and the heavy door suddenly swung open good heavens he cried aghast so the phono-lock is a failure-a fraud that is hardly fair the detective protested the phono-lock was not to blame tt did all that its inventor claimed for it it was its business to open when given the countersign by the right person and you unintention- ally and unconsciously uttered the magic words when you exchanged the compliments of the season over the tel- ephone with mr reginald st john vandiveer chapter ix with good reason a look of enlightenment came to macombers face i see he said the word same combined with the first syllable of the word many made the first amen of the combina- tion exactly kenney assented and vandiveer pretended not to hear you the first time and made you repeat your response-which gave him the sec- ond amen and enabled him to help himself to the jewelry and bonds well ill be jiggered the old man exclaimed that rascal must be more clever than i gave him credit for to have thought of such a trick i re- member now telling him how i could open the safe over the phone it was pretty slick work the de- tective agreed he must have over- heard the countersign many times when you were opening the safe and then or later the idea came to him that the syllables of the password in their con- secutive order were embodied in the conventional response that ninety-nine persons out of a hundred make when wished a merry christmas or a happy new year after that all he had to do was to wait for the proper season to arrive so that he could work his little game on you a pretty safe game too-or at least so he thought the police lieutenant continued it was a trick that could be turned with a minimum of risk he knew the watchman would tell later of his coming here after office hours but he had a plausible excuse ready to account for his presence at all events he figured that you would have no reason to suspect him that the blame would surely fall on young royce macomber nodded and he would surely have got away with it if it hadnt been for you sir he remarked gratefully by the way i owe you an apology for what i said to you that day when you came to warn me of royces past i accused you then i believe of taking a keen delight in hounding an unfortunate man i see now that you are generous enough to give even an ex-convict a square deal when you find- a chuckle from kenney interrupted him it is you that are entitled to  	top-notch magazine an apology the latter declared  i gave you a wrong tip that day  his young man royce you are employing is not the man i look him for so far as  am aware he has never in his life served a day in jail cecilie happened to enter the office in time to hear this announcement of course he hasnt dad she chimed in an angry glint in her eyes mr royce has been deceiving us  have known that for some time deceiving us her father echoed blankly he has been working here under false colors the girl declared indig- nantly i dont believe his name is dick royce and he isnt an ex convict i made that discovery several months ago at the time i brought the warden of sing sing prison here to look over the plant to my surprise mr royce as he calls himself did not recognize our visitor i could see from his man- ner that he had no idea of his identity that aroused my suspicion and pres- ently i spoke to the warden about him and he took a good look at him and told me that although he bore a re- semblance to a man named royce who had served three yeas in sing sing for grand larceny he-the warden-was positive that he was not the same man there were some marked differences between the two the warden said and later when he got back to the prison he looked up the records and verified his statement that the man wre have known as dick royce was an impostor that was what i meant dad the young woman continued when i told you that day that there was some- thing about his past that i could never forgive i didnt care to reveal his secret to you then because t have been hoping all along that sooner or later he would confess his deception for the same reason i have never broached the subject to him but why on earth should he have done such an extraordinary thing asked macomber with a frown ol be- wilderment nphanged if i can un- derstand why a man should voluntarily assume the role of an ex-convict when he- the answer is very simple cecilie cut in with a scornful laugh he has been acting a lie of course because he supposed it was to his material ad- vantage to do so he knew when he came to work here of the great interest that you take in men who are making an honest effort to redeem their past he saw men with prison records in your employ promoted to positions of responsibility and he made the mistake of assuming that an ex-convict who evinced a desire to reform stood a bet- ter chance here than a man who had never gone wrong dont you see dad it was nothing but a sordid scheme on his part to win quick advancement  he thought tliat if he could make us believe that he had a prison past his prospects would be much brighter i cant see that your explanation is right my dear macomber returned royce may have let us think him an ex-convict but he never told us that he was our information came in the first place from lieutenant ken- ney royce had nothing to do with that and if he kept silent when i alluded to the subject later he may have had some other reason than you suggest lieutenant kenney smiled of course he had he asserted if he hadnt i shouldnt be here now it was because i knew the young mans story knew that he had a mighty good reason for sailing under false colors one that entitled him to a whole lot of credit that when i read that he was in trouble j said to myself that it was up to me to come out here and sco if i could do anything for him  learned the truth about him a month or so after  called here to give safe and sound  you the tip that he was a jailbird the policeman continued that was an honest mistake on my part he was down on the books here as richard royce and he bore such a strong re- semblance to his brother that my eyes deceived me his brother macomber and his daughter echoed simultaneously the young man who is working here is howard royce the detective ex- plained it is his brother richard who is the ex-convict he assumed the other mans name because-well perhaps we had better get him out of the lockup and let him tell you his own story i have an idea miss that when you hear it youre going to for- give him chapter x from a different standpoint a wire to the boston police re- suited in the prompt arrest of reginald st john vandiveer on the charge of grand larceny as soon as that astonished young man learned the facts that would be produced in evi- dence against him he obligingly saved the authorities a lot of bother by waiv- ing extradition proceedings and admit- ting his guilt he was in desperate financial straits he confessed and his creditors had been hounding him in the circum- stances the artful trick he had dis- covered for working the combination of the phono-lock safe had looked like such an easy way out of his difficulties that he had been unable to resist the temptation he had felt absolutely confident that royce would be- blamed for the theft and that development he admitted would not have been alto- gether displeasing to him but several hours before this confes- sion reached petersboro macomber and his daughter sat in the office of the machine works listening to another b tn confession from the lips of howard royce when my brother dick came out of prison the young man explained he found it very difficult to get a new start in life you see there are few places like this where a mans past doesnt count against him and every- where he went he was hounded be- cause of his one unfortunate error driven out of one job after another as soon as his employers learned that he had served a term in jail the poor chap was well on the way to become a down-and-outer then the idea came to me that if i assumed his name i might in that way help him i knew that i could stand the police badgering better than he could and in appearance we are very much alike so far the plan has succeeded for nearly a year now my brother under another name has been holding a good job in a western city an exclamation came from ceciiie and you have been willing to make that sacrifice for your brothers sake she said softly royce shrugged his shoulders it hasnt been much of a sacrifice after all he responded not nearly so bad as i expected at first i was turned out of a couple of positions when our friends the police felt it to be their duty to whisper in the ears of my employers that they were giving a jailbird a chance to make an honest living then my luck star directed my steps to this place and since that day-well i have had no cause to complain but dick-i mean howard ma- comber put in why on earth did you not tell us this before surely you could have trusted us with your secret  well sir royce replied you can understand that i was not surprised when you told me that a police officer had called to see you about me at first i was going to tell you the truth  top-notch magazine then but in a moment i decided to keep my own counsel and say nothing for a time while you showed me that you did not hold a mans past record against him i did not know how you would look at what i had done you see i was helping my brother to de- ceive his new employer ami you might not have thought that was right of course t knew my brother and the cir- cumstances which led him to make his one misstep but i could vouch for his innate honesty and knew he was sure to go straight and so all along i have hesitated about letting you know until something happened which-well i just couldnt tell you at all then what do you mean macomber in- quired what can have happened to keep you from confiding in us you saw how i trusted you and promoted you out with it man what was the trouble  royce raised his head and looked steadily at cecilie then he looked straight at macomber well sir he said if i must tell you it was on account of your daugh- ter on account of me cecilie gasped what had i to do with it everything in the world miss ma- comber royce replied quietly you know that for some time we have not been as good friends as we used to be during my first few months here you -well your manner to me changed a lot i couldnt tell why but- that was when  learned from the warden of sing sing that you had never been in his charge cecilie broke in i was angry with you because you had not told us the truth i couldnt know that royce went on and the only thing i could think of was that mr vandiveer was the cause that he had said something or raised some objection to your being friendly with me i felt that to tell you my story then would have put me in a false light in your eyes you might have thought i was trying to place my- self on a level with the other chap but you could have told me ma- comber insisted i-m im afraid i thought only of how your daughter would look at it royce interrupted thats all  cared about tears were in cecilies eyes as she jumped up impulsively her hands out- stretched oh mr royce she said can you ever forgive me

to- day that we citizens of d d gave a swell banquet-a sort of farewell dinner -to our esteemed fellow townsman j adolphus binger now there was this about j adol- phus  he seemed to be ever laboring under the impression that he was a twelve oclock feller in a nine oclock town well maybe he was at that he had been around quite a bit espe- cially down in the south sea isles where he got hold of a number of well- paying coconut groves and had made a lot of money from his copra and trad- ing with the natives but if j adol- phus thought he was just a little bet- ter than the rest of the herd in daw- sons dells it wasnt because he had money nor because of his big stock of copra down there in the south seas it was because he actually believed that he-individually-was just about the best little singer that ever gargled an impassioned love ditty or took the dry- fog vapor cure in the picturesque little village of salso-maggiore well i guess maybe he had a pretty swell set of pipes at that but as i say if any of us citizens of dawsons dells ever heard j adolphus doing any heavy bragging it was not about his boodle but rather about how he could yodle some singer-that binger at least to hear him tell it well one day he came in the grocery store with a telegram hed just re- ceived in his hand boys he said kind of important like it sort of looks like id have to be leaving you all soon why hows that we all asked well you know i hate to talk about myself but you know as well as i do that i am some singer- oh sure and this fact so it appears from this telegram has reached far beyond the peaceful environs of dawsons dells hows that queried speck bo- ner our assistant depot master they want me to come to new york -to sing that sure made some commotion w-hen he told us that the news spread around town and a big throng was on hand to listen when finally he read the telegram out loud j adolphus binger dawsons dells we arc forwarding contract which please fill in at your own figures we will pay your price wire us metropolitan opera company iso top-notch magazine now when a mans got the goods right in his mitt to show i guess theres no call to accuse him of stalling is there hardly and though we of dawsons dells were momentarily stunned by the stupendousness of the whole thing we quickly rallied and ex- tended our congratulations the singer himself j adolphus bin- ger took it all modestly enough you see he said to us patronizingly as i figure it the company-the metro- politan opera company-has been sort of up against it this year per- sonally i think that pasquale amato and some of those old birds havent been going good of late the company has felt the need of new blood hence this telegram to me will i accept well well will i the next night we gave a big spread for our talented and celebrated singer in the hall over the grocery store all the elite of the town were there j adolphus was on hand all dressed up like a horse and looking very haughty well there were speeches galore and complimentary addresses and just as we were about to sit down to the big cats speck boner came running up and handed our singer another telegram j adolphus took it a smile playing about his lips i guess they want me to hurry up he said he read the telegram and his face went white then crimson he picked up his hat and bolted for the door dropping the message in his haste but the dinner exclaimcd the committee in charge were all ready to sit down to eat well i cant repeat what j adolphus said in reply it would be censored anyhow he told them all where they could go to eat the dinner theyd pre- pared and it wasnt to any frigid zone at that as binger disappeared through the door speck boner picked up the telegram from thfc floor and read out loud j adolphus uinttn dawsons dells error in transmitting instead of metro- politan opera company read metropolitan cofra company-m our assistant depot master read no further he turned to the throng that contract he said simply wasnt to get bingers services as a singer but to get his nut food the crowd groaned aw well said speck boner lets eat  october th-still cool rather quiet why we shave it is difficult to find

 -- i-- w alifax had known elise ever since she was a little girl it was a blow to him when she married felix ray- don it soon became evi- dent that raydon was not the man for her he spent her money and neg- lected her even now he was living in an apartment in the city leaving her out in the village of bellport one night halifax called on raydon to pro- test there were hot words halifax struck him and raydon crumpled to the floor and lay still as halifax stood there filled with horror a key turned in the door and doctor bazarin a dark-skinned man of spanish or italian birth came in hfc was a fash- ionable physician whom halifax had once met in raydons company hali- fax frankly related what had happened bazarin then made halifax a peculiar proposition if halifax would come to work for him a week hence in his pri- vate hospital-obey him absolutely without question-bazarin would get him out of his present fix halifax agreed and as ordered by the doctor left the apartment at once he re- turned in a short time however as he had forgotten his stick and gloves he found the apartment empty and his stick and gloves gone the elevator man said that he had not seen any one leave the apartment a few days later elise much perturbed called on hali- fax she said that her husbands cred- itors were swooping down on her and she feared something terrible had hap- pened halifax filled with conflicting emotions admitted having called on him and quarreled but evaded telling her the truth at the appointed time he went to the address in the bronx given him by bazarin it was a gloomy old house a middle-aged woman mrs nicholls admitted him then left him to wait for bazarin on a desk halifax saw a paper with raydons name on it and some strange figures suddenly upstairs he heard a peculiar cry rushing to the hall he saw at the head of the stairs the swaying fig- ure of a man being led by mrs nich- olls it was raydon entering at that moment bazarin took halifax back to the library as- suring him that what he thought he  top-notch magazine had seen was an illusion he took halifax upstairs and showed him ray- don stretched on a couch dead baza- rin would not tell how raydon s body came there he would give no explana- tion of what halifax had seen or imagined he had seen his brain reel- ing halifax accompanied the doctor to his madison avenue offices where bazarin said halifax was to work in- stead of in the bronx later on the street halifax met his friend jack martin a lawyer to whom he had sent elise in a friendly way martin ques- tioned him about raydon it was evi- dent that martin had his suspicions halifax returned to madison avenue bazarin plainly upset told him to avoid elise then ordered him to go to the house in the bronx and bring an instrument case to an address out in hempstead long island where baza- rin was going on a hurry call in the bronx house halifax again came on mrs nicholls supporting the figure of a man-raydon beyond a doubt halifax ran upstairs the figure was now stretched on the floor there seemed no doubt that raydon was dead -but halifax saw an arm twitch and move hoarsely he demanded an ex- planation from the woman  if you want to know the truth about what you have seen she said harshly you must ask doctor bazarin but remember my warning there are some things better never known there was a look of tragedy in her face furrowed with lines as she spoke and now go she went on or an- other crime will be laid at your door chapter viii bazarin everywhere phfre was something in the man- ner of the woman that startled halifax and compelled him to obey all right he said turning from the ghastly object at his feet but cost what it may i intend to solve this dreadful riddle she did not speak but merely raised her hand with a sudden gesture and pointed to the door with an involun- tary shudder halifax hurried away leaving her in the room ill lighted by the flaring gas jet alone with the material presence of felix raydon dead-yet not dead in the taxicab he drove with all speed to the pennsyl- vania station and took a train for hempstead it seemed ages before the cab that carried him from the station at hempstead drew up outside a large house in one of the best streets of that suburb the roadway was covered with straw to deaden the sound of traf- fic the door was opened by a man- servant who answered halifaxs ques- tions in a lowered voice yes he said doctor bazarin is still here will you come in please he showed the visitor into the li- brary there halifax paced up and down the room awaiting the appear- ance of bazarin suddenly the doctor stood before him his face was ex- ceedingly pale his sunken eyes shone with a feverish brilliancy when he spoke his voice was unnaturally low it was the calmness that precedes the storm you are too late he said so softly that halifax mistook his suppressed rage for a gentler emotion what has delayed you  i knocked several times and got no reply halifax said his voice rising as he spoke i had to get into your house the best way i could was mrs nicholls not there he asked with a change of tone yes she wras there she was with felix raydon ahl he paused then he stretched out his hand give me my case with felix raydon halifax re- secret supreme  peated who is not dead at all i saw him move lower your voice commanded bazarin if not for your sake then out of respect for this household then he came very close to halifax so that they stood glaring into each others eyes so that is what your promise is worth he said cuttingly you have been prying tell me what you have seen i saw raydon supported by your woman nicholls heaven knows what she was doing to him he was fully dressed then she laid him on the ground he moved his arm-twice bazarin checked an exclamation he was clearly agitated by what halifax had told him taking his case he made as though to leave the room abruptly but the other stopped him you must tell me what it means halifax cried i have the right to know you are practicing some dread- ful art on raydon you are trying to force me to be your accomplice by per- suading me that i killed raydon it is not true if raydon is dead- he made an imperious gesture for silence a lady on whose face were evidences of great grief had entered the room when she saw that it was oc- cupied she turned away without giv- ing halifax a glance bazarin followed her into the hall talking to her in a low gentle voice for some time halifax remained in the library hesitating what to do then the servant who had let him in en- tered doctor bazarin has gone sir he said he had balked halifax again he had determined to have done with the doctor there and then but now he re- alized that if he wanted to discover his secret he should have to return to madison avenue and tackle him there at the gate he felt a touch on his arm by his side stood a big policeman the thought that he was there to arrest halifax made his heart stand still but his words were reassuring is it all over with the gentleman in there sir he asked ingratiatingly i dont know halifax replied hur- riedly i think so somebody has died in that house at any rate ah thats him right enough then said the man well its just as well for you couldnt have said that he had lived at all for several years could you  halifaxs interest was aroused what was the matter with him he asked sort o paralysis i think said the policeman glad to get somebody to talk to he got hurt in a motor-car acci- dent about five years ago picked up for dead he was im not sure but they was going to bury him when doctor bazarin took the case up youve heard of doctor bazarin havent you well this was the case that made him there was columns about it in the papers what did doctor bazarin do brought him back to life as you might say although it wasnt much of a life being wheeled about like a living corpse couldnt speak could the poor gentleman and they say that he couldnt eat either i only saw him once for they never took him out i had to go into the house once to tell them about a faker that was supposed to be collectin for the heathen and i saw him being carried across the hall i thought sure he was a dead man at the time and he was like that for five years the constables words set halifax thinking the description he had given applied exactly to felix raydon a living corpse-that was what halifax had seen in the gloomy house in the bronx he walked back to madison avenue and when he arrived there he learned  top-notcli magazine that doctor bazarin had telephoned that he would not be back that night halifax left the house next morn- ing not troubling to consider whether he was neglecting his duties or not for all he could think of was the extraor- dinary power of bazarin he resolved to see elise raydon again first be- cause he was uneasy in mind regarding her welfare and second because he fancied that he might be able to elicit from her some information about baz- arin as soon as possible he went to bell- port long island he had some diffi- culty finding the house in which mrs raydon lived there wras nobody about of whom to inquire so at last he made up his mind to ring the bell of a house called the laurels and ask there where osborne was to be found he pushed open the little gate and pressed the electric bell as he waited for some one to open the door he saw farther up the road a man come out of a house and make his way quickly along the street the man was bazarin  his back was to halifax but there was no mistaking that imposing figure the next moment he had disappeared round the corner osborne said the woman who opened the door was five houses up the road halifax thanked her and took his departure the fifth house up the road was the house from which he had seen bazarin go away his presence there alarmed halifax what had he been doing there hali- fax knew that he and elise hated and feared each other but what could a gentle highly strung girl like elise avail against bazarin halifax hastened to the door and rang the bell there was no reply he rang again and again and then knocked loudly the door of the next bouse opened and a woman with a broom threw a suspicious glance at him there aint no one in that house she volunteered at length does mrs raydon not live here halifax asked she did but she dont now when did she leave i dont know for certain-twfo or three days ago but is she coming back that i cant say but the furniture is still in the house halifax urged after a glance through the window near the door what there is of it-yes the woman began sweeping the steps keeping an eye on him as he tried in vain the handle of the door a nameless dread made his heart heavy as he turned away what had happened to elise where had she gone these again were questions that he should force bazarin to answer that he could answer them halifax had no doubt at all he felt convinced that bazarin was in some way connected with the disappearance of elise and it did not console him to know that the doctor was none too scrupulous in his methods at the station he had to wait an unconscionably long time for a train back to new york and as he stamped up and down the platform he made up his mind to see martin as soon as possible after his arrival there was a chance he believed that elise had told martin where she was going the train got in a quarter of an hour late but this did not deter halifax from carrying out his program mar- tin lived in a studio building on the west side and there halifax drove at once martins greeting halifax fancied was less cordial than usual he expressed a somewhat chilly pleas- ure at sight of the visitor and asked what he could do for him i have just returned from bellport halifax said i went to see elise did you see her martin asked with some eagerness secret supreme  no i did not i was lold that she had gone i came to ask you if you can tell me where she has gone mar- tin rose from his chair and paced up and down the room no i cannot he said i experi- enced the same surprise yesterday three days ago i wrote and asked her to call on me i got no reply then i wired and yesterday after meeting you i went down to bellport to see what was the matter the house was shut up i have just posted a letter ask- ing you to call on me i thought you might clear the matter up halifax shook his head i cannot understand it he said where can she be and what has prompted her to take so sudden a step demanded martin why has she not let me know there are a hundred and one things i want to talk over with her he stopped pacing about and con- fronted halifax have you any idea at all what can have induced her to give us all the slip like this he asked insistently none at all unless- unless what nothing halifax said shortly at least its not worth mentioning out with it man martin said testily any suggestion is better than none well the other answered unless it has something to do with bazarin martin banged his fist on his desk the identical thought that occurred to me he exclaimed when i saw mrs raydon last she told me that you were going to work for bazarin she was most fearfully upset i could see that she hated the man as though he were the devil himself do you know why he asked abruptly no i do not i wish i did well continued marlin when i went out to bellport to call on mrs raydon who do you think i should see coming into the station as i left it bazarin halifax cried his heart leaping  the very man how did you guess because this morning i saw him coming out of mrs raydons house he narrated his experiences of the morning and the two occasions on which he had seen bazarin his ex- citement got the better of him for he talked vehemently about bazarin mar- tin listened carefully while he spoke his expression changed from one of surprise to one of deep concern if you distrust bazarin like this he broke in at length why on earth do you not have done with him  his question brought halifax to his senses how can i do that he grum- bled he is the first man i have met for a very long time who was willing to pay for my services martin came over to halifax and laid his hand affectionately on his shoulder that is not the reason old boy he said kindly and you know it you are keeping something back from me when you care to tell me i shall be ready to listen and if i can help you my services are at your com- mand im fond of you halifax he added in a queer voice i wish youd let me be your friend you are my friend  the other cried impulsively the only friend ive got at present he was silent for a mo- ment and then he said more quietly you are right martin i am keeping something back from you-something so mysterious and horrible that i can scarcely bear to think of it i cannot tell you now please heaven you will know everything very soon he rose to his feet and caught martin by the arm what we have got to do he said with all the impressiveness at his command is to find elise raydon that she needs our help i am prepared  top-notcm magazn e to swear that she is in danger i know too well i too am in danger great danger if anything should happen to me martin look after elise martins eyes seemed to read hali- faxs soul his expression softened i will old hoy he said and he gripped his friends hand vyou can rely on me but he sighed i wish you could point to me the direction from which you fear this danger halifax hesitated for a moment then he made up his mind if i do lie said will you give me your word of honor that you will keep it secret either until i give you permission to speak or until you are positively forced by circumstances to do so i give you my word of honor mar- tin replied gravely halifax openedhis mouth to speak when there was a knock at the door come in  cried martin a clerk entered with a card in his hand martin glanced at the slip of pasteboard well of all the- he began he handed halifax the card on it was printed the name of bazarin chapter ix the eye of suspicion viartin and halifax stared at the card in puzzled amazement id better see him alone said martin go into that room i shall not tell him you arc here halifax passed quickly into the ad- joining room where two clerks sat writ- ing at a desk martin shut the door and he was left to his own thoughts for nearly half an hour he sat there wondering what bazarin had to say to martin he was relieved when the door opened and martin called his name hes gone he said slowly he looked worried and ill at ease he is a most extraordinary man he paused and halifax waited impatiently for him to go on he called to find out where mrs raydon is did you tell him i toid him ail i know which is nothing what made him come to you i asked him that he said that mrs raydon told him i was acting for her then he has seen her evidently but when and how i cant make out probably he lied that is possible but if mrs ray- don did not tell him who did not i at any rate halifax de- clared ive never mentioned your name to him could he have followed you here this morning asked martin it is unlikely i was driving and he was on foot besides i dont think he saw me but what does it matter halifax cried did be say what he wanted to see elise for he said that he had a message for her from whom from her husband what halifax exclaimed rising to his feet those were his words replied martin watching the other closely i asked him where raydon was if he were alive or dead well  he replied that he was under a sol- emn promise to raydon to give his mes- sage to his wife alone and that he could give no further information halifax breathed more freely it was at a time like that he realized how completely bazarin had him in his power how the dread of his guilt being discovered might leave him for a time but only to come back in full force in times of danger he was remarkably frank with me secret supreme   said martin musingly he said that he knew that mrs raydon lacked money and that he would like to be able to help her he said that he was under an obligation to help her con- found him cried martin testily i believe he told me a pack of lies and then i half think he was speaking the truth if bazarin is a dangerous man he is a clever man as well it is a good thing i could tell him nothing or he would have wormed all i knew out of me well at any rate halifax said its a good thing that he does not know where elise is but can we believe that perhaps his inquiries were intended to make us think so you must know what my sus- picions are i suspect bazarin of hav- ing something to do with raydons dis- appearance from inquiries i have made i have learned that bazarin and raydon were on terms of intimacy if not of friendship bazarin had a key to raydons flat he used to visit him frequently occasionally they were heard quarreling i think-although i have only the vaguest grounds for the suspicion-that bazarin supplied ray- don with money halifax listened with growing shame he was acting the hypocrite to the man who thought he was his ally one word from him would have set martin on the right track not only was he allowing suspicion to be cast on the wrong man but he was stand- ing in the way of redress to elise he berated himself for a blackguard and a coward now everybody knows that ray- don was a scoundrel went on mar- tin pie was a flippant man of the world a rake of the worst type what interest in the world could a man like bazarin have in such a man as ray- don  why did he call on him so often  over what topics did they quarrel once these questions are answered the reason and cause of raydons disap- pearance will be made plain i feel certain of that and i am inclined to think that the reason of mrs raydons sudden departure will be explained also we must find mrs raydon hali- fax said gruffly that may not be easy responded martin there is no use asking the aid of the police here is a man who is we may say in the habit of leaving his wife now and again he tells you he is going to canada or some place and the next day he is not to be found in newr york the police would only smile if we told them that because of certain additional circumstances-i mean the appearance of the duns at bellport and so on-we suspected that he had left his wife forever that he may be dead murdered even no he went on we havent enough to go on with yet we must work away by ourselves for the pres- ent what i shall do next is to find out all i can about bazarin i know gour- lay the heart specialist he is in chi- cago just now hell be back in a day or twro ill call and see him hell know all about bazarin halifax took his departure and broke for the first time in his life one of his rules he went into a cafe and drank hurriedly a couple of stiff high balls when he got back to madison avenue doctor bazarin was at lunch hello halifax he said i was beginning to think you had given me the slip take that chair and sit down i want to talk to you halifax obeyed and sat down at the table it was impossible to tackle this man whose moods wrere so disconcert- ingly variable at the moment he looked worried but his voice was kind and before speaking he passed on to halifax various dishes containing ap- petizing food i too have taken a holiday he be-  top-notch magazine gan with a faint smile i have been to bellport he announced abruptly indeed was all halifax could say this is the second lime  have gone out thereto find mrs raydon the house is shut up do you know where she is no i dont i particularly wanted to see her about-about this business bazarin continued you see we must allay any suspicion of-well suspicions con- cerning the welfare of her husband the way in which he calmly assumed that halifax was acting with him made the mans brain swim and yet-was halifax not acting with him i dont believe she has got a penny piece in the world went on bazarin raydons affairs were most terribly in- volved now before very long well have mrs raydon setting this lawyer fellow of hers to work to get a sep- aration for her and before we can say jack robinson theyll be finding out that it isnt a case of desertion but of murder he pushed aside his plate and fold- ing his arms on the table looked hali- fax full in the face mrs raydons disappearance is awkward-very i did not calculate on it he said if she were still here i had invented a harmless fiction that she would have readily believed ray- don was once useful to me and i used to pay him a trilie now and again when he was more than usually hard up a he said this bazarin caught up a knife and pressed it on the table so viciously that the tablecloth was cut mrs raydon knew that i paid him this money she did not love me the better for it and he smiled again women are like that they hate anybody who knows their husbands secrets of which they themselves arc ignorant now if i could see mrs raydon i could easily persuade her that her husband had in- trusted me with the paying of these occasional sums i am sure i could in that way we could get time time for what halifax asked for laying our plans look here my dear halifax-bazarin pushed back his chair and rose-you arc con- vinced that i am deceiving you in some way seeking to gel a hold over you or something i know you are you want to settle this matter for yourself but you are not able cant you realize that if you had half a chance you would have the rope round your neck in less than no time for heavens sake bazarin- oh yes you would you have al- ready told far too much that you should have kept silent about you must let me save you you cannot save your- self worse still you will drag me into the business as well in fact i am in- clined to think i am in it already - what do you mean  i mean that your friend martin thinks that i killed raydon-i baza- rin laughed and halifax shuddered at the sound how do you know i called on him to-day i called on him because i knew you had been there in fact i think you were hid- den somewhere away in the office while i was there oh you neednt look so surprised i knew what you told mar- tin when you met him in broadway you practically told me all yourself then  saw you going to <fhe office to- day. Then I made up my mind to see him also, to find out how much more you had given away.” Halifax stared at Bazarin, fascinated. Bazarin smiled again at the other’s look of helplessness. “f found that you had very cleverly set him on the wrong track. And yet it was not very clever to make me out the murderer, was it?” said the doctor, smiling. “1 did nothing of the kind." “Not very chivalrous?” SECRET SUPREME 189 “I tell you, I didn’t. I-” “Well, well, I dare say you didn't mean to. But we’ve got to put that idea out of your friend’s head at all costs, or we’ll have him paying a night visit to the Bronx just as you did.” Halifax sat silent. Fate seemed to be spinning a web round him from which extrication was impossible. Not only did Bazarin show him what a fool he was, but what a treacherous knave as well. His accusation and implied contempt shamed Halifax; he could not deny the truth of the assertion. If he had not wittingly pointed to Bazarin as the murderer of Raydon, he had at least sat still and acquiesced while the suspicion was put forward. “Why do you do this for me?” Hali- fax burst out. “Why do you run this risk? What am I to you?” “I have already told you. I do it because I hated Raydon and because I think I could like you-if you allowed me to,” he added, with a smile. “But,” he continued, “I must admit that when I took this matter up I never thought it would become so complicated an af- fair. I thought I could get rid of Ray- don easily. I find it difficult. And it is you,” he added sternly, “who are mak- ing it difficult.” “I?” “Yes, you, with your foolish imagin- ings, your weak scruples, your inquisi- tiveness! Why didn’t you let me alone,” he cried angrily, “to finish what I had begun? You have the semblance of a man. Why don’t you act like one?” “Doctor Bazarin,” Halifax exclaimed impetuously, “you ask me to trust you. You demand that I should trust you. Why don’t you trust me? Why don’t you tell me the meaning of what I saw at the house in the Bronx? What are you doing to Raydon?” Such was the effect of his words that he thought Bazarin had taken leave of his senses. His massive face grew deadly pale, so that the veins in his forehead, which rose into prominence when he was excited, shone blue on the white skin, and Halifax could see the muscles of his heavy jaw working. He came toward him, his fingers twitching convulsively, and it came into Halifax’s mind that those fingers would be con- tent only if they rested on his throat. He took only one step forward, glar- ing at Halifax. What he saw on his face he knew not. but it made the doc- tor alter his tactics. When he spoke, his voice was soft, the voice of one who is rebuking a headstrong child. “My dear Halifax,” he said, but his voice shook a little, “you will know all in good time. Believe me, I am only doing what is necessary' for your safety -yours and mine. Were I to tell you just now all you want to know, it might be disastrous for us both. It would, I feel sure, be fatal to you. For myself I do not mean to take the risk. Don’t you see that you have already failed me in these few days? You must prove to me that I can trust you before I put myself in your hands. And now”-he turned away-“I must go to my pa- tients.” But, as he left the room. Halifax felt that he had won his first victory. CHAPTER X. BY A LUCKY CHANCE. LJALIFAX began his search for Elise the next day. He laid his plans as carefully as possible. First of all he interviewed all those who were likely to hear of Elise’s movements. For several days he spent all his spare time in making a round of calls on peo- ple whose curiosity about his own af- fairs was most distasteful to him. He had continually to be on his guard, and only his anxiety for Elise’s safety made him continue these interviews until the list was exhausted. He remembered that Elise had, in the old days, declared that she would like 190 TOP-NOTCH MAGAZINE to earn her living, and he was inclined to think that in the time of need she had either found, or was seeking, em- ployment. But of what nature that employment might be he was entirely ignorant. Elise was one of those care- fulh educated girls who could well be anything in general, but who would find it difficult to be something in par- ticular. It got into his head that she might have found a situation in a store, and accordingly he made all sorts of excuses to visit the big establishments around Broadway and Thirty-fourth Street. But it was all in vain. Many were the pretty faces that he saw, but Elise’s was not one of them. And on those faces he fancied, at times, that he saw the marks of weariness and disappoint- ment. and even of tragedy, and then he would grow sick at heart with anxiety for Elise. His work with Bazarin was not hard enough to make him forget these thoughts. He kept him at Madison Avenue, writing up his books, arrang- ing his appointments, and making him- self generally useful. It was so com- monplace a routine, that at times it was not easy for him to believe that he had not dreamed the eventful incidents which had marked the beginning of his duties. He called on Martin once, and found that the lawyer had little or nothing to report. He had no news of Elise, and was reticent concerning the in- quiries he was making. Halifax knew now that he took him to be a blunder- ing fellow, who was best kept in the dark when serious business was afoot. But he told him that he had seen Gour- lay, the specialist, and had asked him about Bazarin. He had learned that Bazarin had an immense practice in neurotic diseases, and had been sensa- tionally successful with one or two cases of paralysis, incipient and more fully developed. This did not take them any further. About the house in the Bronx Martin was told that on a few rare occasions Bazarin had received there patients whom he wished to have under his own observation, but that latterly he had given up this part of his work, and Gourlay believed that nobody had been received there for several years. This explained to some extent the lack of organization, and the neglected appearance which had struck Halifax aiwut the Bronx establishment. But if Bazarin had given up receiving patients there, why did he continue to keep the place up? That he visited it very often Halifax felt certain, and never did he return after a long absence in his mo- tor car but that Halifax searched his face for something that would tell him what was happening in the house that contained the man he had slain. And then he would wonder if Ray- don were still there. He did not dare ask Bazarin for fear he should renew the distrust in his mind. It seemed that he was beginning to take Halifax more into his confidence, and the secretary was shrew’d enough to understand that in this way lay his best chance of ever learning the secret of the things he had seen. So far as lav in his power, he tried to make Bazarin believe that he had ceased to trouble about what he did not understand. When he talked to- him it was of commonplace things, and it was not difficult to see that his change of attitude toward the doctor pleased him immensely. Halifax felt strangely alone these days. He had been used to being sur- rounded by a host of friends, good fel- lows whom he met at his club, and their relatives and friends, to whose homes he was invited. He had drifted away from all these people. Even had his time been his own, as it used to be, he had not the inclination to meet his friends. Often his loneliness op- pressed him. SECRET SUPREME 191 One afternoon he set out for a walk, and his steps led him along Madison Avenue to Forty-second Street, and then eastward to Third Avenue. In an old shop in the latter street he found some pieces of blue china which inter- ested him, and for some time he exam- ined them, wishing that he had the means to purchase them and the op- portunity to make use of them, did he possess them. When at length he turned away, he saw a figure that caused his heart to jump. It was the figure of Elise Raydon. Several par- cels in her hand showed that she had been shopping. She was dressed in black, and it seemed to him that she looked forlorn and unhappy. Halifax hurried after her, but she was walking quickly, and the crowd got in his w'ay, so that it was some time before he could get alongside of her. More than one angry glance was cast after him as he shouldered his way through the throng. Once he thought he had missed her. for she was able to cross the street before the traffic coming along held him up, and when he had darted across after her she was no- where to be seen. He strode on, his eyes sweeping the countenances of those he passed or overtook. Presently he saw her again. She was looking in at a shop window. In a moment he was at her side. He did not speak; he did not know what to say. He just stood there look- ing down at her. She meant so much to him, and he had found her! For a moment she was unconscious of his presence. Then she looked up, and her expression changed from one of list- lessness to one of fear. “Elise!” he exclaimed ; but she drew back from him, her color going and coming. “Elise, what is the matter? Why have you run away from us? I have been searching New York for you. And now, thank Heaven, I have found you!” With a visible effort she was forc- ing herself to speak calmly to him. He could see that something was causing her to be profoundly moved. “Yes, you have found me,” she re- plied in a low voice, “and I am sorry.'* “Sorry!” “Yes, I must not see you. I left home so that you should not see me.” “But-” “You must ask me no questions. You have said that you are a friend of mine, and you are, are you not?” “A friend ! Elise-” “Well, you must obey me. You must do as I ask. For pin ’s sake, do as I ask.” “What, in Heaven’s name, is the mat- ter, Elise?” “I cannot tell you. But, please, please leave me alone. Go away. Do not try to see me again.” Several people standing by cast curi- ous glances at them, and he insisted on Elise walking with him a little up the street. She did so, hanging back at the time, and strangely ill at ease. “What on earth does this mean, Elise?” he demanded. “Do you think that you are going to get rid of your friends like this? No; a thousand times, no! You can't quarrel with me, Elise, for it takes two to make a quar- rel.” “You know I do not wish to quarrel with you, Jim,” she said, her ej'es filling with tears. “Then why-” “I cannot tell you. Oh. please, please don’t ask me. Only go away, and quickly.” She cast her eyes fearfully round. “I want to be left alone." “And I tell you that I shall not leave you alone,” he declared, with a clumsy attempt at joviality. “I can see very well that you need some one to look after you, and Jim Halifax is the man.” And then her manner changed. She drew herself up, and her eyes, as they met his, were full of determination. “I 192 TOP-NOTCH MAGAZINE cannot prevent you, Jim, from forcing yourself upon me.” she said quietly, • but I hope you are enough of a friend to do as 1 ask. levant to go." “But, Elise-' ”1 mean it. 1 am sorry, Jim, but it is for my own sake I ask it.” She paused a moment. “My own-and yours.” “But this is preposterous. You are not in danger--” "So long as vou are with me, I am.” Her lips trembled. “The danger is a very real and grave one.” “Do you mean”-he could hardly speak the word-"Bazarin?” “Never mind,” she replied, with a calm insistence. “Go back to Madi- son Avenue, and forget that you ever were a friend of mine. You may be of great use to me, but only if you never see me. Now go, Jim. Dear old Jim.” He looked away. There was a note of distress in her last words that made him afraid to look upon her face. He stood there, biting his lips and won- dering what was to be done. And when he turned his eyes again, Elise was gone. CHAPTER XI. ENTER THE POLICE. HpHE disappearance of Felix Raydon could not remain their secret for- ever, and the wonder is that they held it so long. Presently his acquaintances -not his friends, for such a man as he could have no friends-his acquaint- ances began to inquire after him, and, receiving no answer, vague rumors be- gan to spread about. Martin told Halifax of these, for he was in the world, while Halifax, to all intents and purposes, was out of it. Felix Raydon, it was whispered, had fled the country, leaving his debts be- hind him, and had set up another estab- lishment in Paris. He was supposed to have been seen in many well-known re- -sorts-Halifax could not remember all the places where Raydon had been seen. And the rumors grew and grew un- til they culminated in the bold state- ment that Raydon was dead. At first it was agreed that he had died in a den of iniquity in a foreign city somewhere; that he had been killed in a brawl; and, in the end, that he had been murdered before he left these shores. A loud-voiced fellow called Grim- shaw had started this rumor at the Unity Club, lie declared that he had arranged to meet Raydon at Charing Cross Station, London, and to accom- pany him across the Channel, and Ray- don had never turned up. And it had been in Raydon’s interest to put in an appearance, since Grimshaw was going to lend him money. Halifax couldn't give in detail the strands of the slender web which this man wrove into a clear case of murder. It was a palpably weak case; it abounded in suppositions; but it gained credence, and one morn- ing a paragraph in a daily paper in- formed the public that the police had taken up the case. Bazarin saw the paragraph almost as soon as Halifax, and came to him with the paper in his hand, and a curi- ous gleam in his cold eyes. “Here is something that may inter- est you,” he said. “Do you mean that about Raydon ?” said Halifax. “I’ve read it.” “Out of the mouths of babes-” Bazarin quoted. “If it weren't for the fools these men would get no wiser. They suggest the improbable, which turns out to be the obvious. If Grim- shaw had not promised to lend Raydon money, nObody would have listened to his theory/’ “Then you heard the rumor?” “Of course I heard it. Not even I am high enough up in my profession to disregard gossip. The latest scandal is often far more valuable knowledge than the latest pathological discovery.” SECRET SUPREME 193 “But why ts the idea of Grimshaw's promise to lend money the important factor?" “Because it is the improbable. Grim- shaw never had any money to lend, which is the wrorst possible excuse for parsimony." Halifax looked steadfastly at Baza- rin, who met his glance with a careless smile. “You take this very lightly," Halifax said sternly. “I do," he replied. “Don't you?" “It seems to me to be-the begin- ning of the end." “And to me it seems the end," was the smiling rejoinder. “Good heavens!" Halifax almost shouted. “You say that as if you were glad! Don’t you realize-’’ “I think so," he interrupted. “That is why I am always satisfied when I come to the end. A scientist insists on explanations, and no explanation is complete till an end is reached.” “But what is to be done?” “The central-office detectives will answer that question. A great many things will be done. You and I will be approached with diffidence and respect and required to assist the authorities in their search for Raydon. That we shall do very willingly, for men in our position are always ready to cooperate in the interests of justice." Bazarin threw himself in a chair and continued, speaking in a calm, insistent voice as though seeking to impress upon Halifax a lesson that he had to learn: “We must be careful to tell the truth. To lie successfully is one of the most difficult of arts. Truthfulness is called virtue, .yet it always pays, and it is safe and easy. One must then tell the truth. Of course, it is impossible to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth. Nobody does that save candid friends. You will tell inquirers of your visit to Raydon's flat, of your object, of the result of yoGr objcct, 13B tn you remember.” he said dreamily, “that you left because your words fell on deaf ears. Raydon was determined to leave the country and bis wife. My own answers will be likewise truthful and obvious. When the visits of a medical man to his patient arouse sus- picion will be an evil day for my pro- fession. My dear fellow, when I said that this was the end, 1 meant that in a few days the mystery of Raydon’s disappearance will be solved.” “What!” “\es, solved. It will be proved be- yond doubt that he has given his wife and insistent creditors the slip. And when this solution has received the im- primatur of the central office and the press, you can walk abroad with your head in the air and a heart as light as it used to be. Come, cheer up; for- tune is working for you.” He sprang buoyantly to his feet. “You are as safe,” he said, giving Halifax's arm a friendly squeeze as he made his way to the door, “as the treasury of the United States." Halifax was not reassured. He re- membered his return visit to the flat, his conversation with the hall porter. Baz- arin saw that he was disturbed, and he came back to murmur in his ear: “Before it can be proved that Ray- don was murdered they must find his dead body.” Then he turned on his heel, leaving Halifax more than ever upset by his words. Halifax sat down and tried to think the situation out. He knew that Baz- arin’s advice was good as far as it went, but, so it seemed to him, it did not go far enough. It w*as plain enough that concealment of Halifax’s visit to Raydon’s flat would immediately bring down suspicion on him. He had to tell the truth, but not the whole truth, and it was no easy matter to know at what point to leave off and where to take up 194 TOP-NOTCIi MAGAZINE again the thread of his lamentable ad- venture. The fact that the murder could not be proved till Raydon's body was dis- covered only served to increase Hali- fax’s fears. The body was bound to be discovered sooner or later. If the po- lice were to visit the dismal house in the Bronx it would be almost impos- sible to prevent discovery. And then a hundred frightful thoughts entered his mind. Was the body of Raydon still there? What was Bazarin doing with it? Was the strange and awful phenomenon he had witnessed still tak- ing place? Halifax became seized with an idea to find out those things for himself. But how? Bazarin gave him no op- portunity to visit the house. That he himself went there regularly, Halifax was positive. And he believed that he went there in the afternoon, which was the only time Halifax had for him- self. Nor did he suppose that even if he did visit the house he could again gain entrance. The woman Nicholls and her husband were formidable guardians, and would not be likely to leave an entrance unwatched for a sec- ond time. The more impossible it ap- peared for Halifax to satisfy his curi- osity as to what that dreadful house contained, the more did he long to do so. That evening Bazarin came to him in the library. He was dressed, as was his wont, with punctilious care. His manner was grave and reserved. Hali- fax had never seen a wise and pros- perous physician look so wise and pros- perous as he. “A plain-clothes man from the cen- tral office will be here presently/’ he announced. “You will see him, of course.” Halifax for a moment was seized with a feeling of sick terror. Then Bazarin said sharply: “There is ab- solutely nothing to terrify you.” “How did they find out?” Halifax stammered. “Find out what ?” “That we know anything about- Raydon?” “Because I told them/’ “You told them!” “Yes' I have just rung up the cen- tral office and asked for some one to be sent along to call on me. I said that we had information that might be of use to them.” “Well, I’m hanged!” The boldness, the effrontery of the man filled Halifax with something like admiration. It was not to be credited that any one could suspect Doctor Baza- rin of being mixed up in a sordid crime. “I congratulate you,” Halifax said. “You are wonderful!” A flicker of a smile crossed his face, but the other did not say any more for fear of offending him. Bazarin was not the man to appreciate being under- stood. Halifax was not so sure of himself. He paced the room once or twice in order to pull himself together. Then he came to a halt in front of Bazarin. “Will I pass muster?” he said. The doctor glanced at him critically. “I think so. But why do you adopt a defiant air? Our visitor is not going to eat you. He will be far more ill at ease than you think. A little sympathy, the suggestion of distress, a dignified willingness to help, these are the sug- gestions your manner ought to convey.’’ He moved across to a cabinet, and, picking up a piece of rare and extremely ugly Staffordshire, examined it with the appreciation of a connoisseur. Halifax was watching him turning over in his hands the piece of china when a man- servant entered and handed him a card. Bazarin glanced at it. “Show him in,” he said shortly. Then he glanced at Halifax, and the look in his eyes thrilled him to the marrow. There was the majesty of command that must be SECRET SUPREME 1V5 obeyed, the fire of encouragement that made obedience a dearest joy. "Our visitor," he said softly, then: “I wish I could make you appreciate, Halifax, that beauty has no standard, that in this combination of salmon pink and garish green there is a harmony that belongs only to old Staffordshire. I wish- Ah! How do you do, sir? Will you be seated ?” And Halifax found himself bowing to the quietly dressed man who was searching for Ray don’s murderer. De- tective Lieutenant Hibbert sat down and placed his hat on a chair beside him. He waited with an air of polite expectancy for Doctor Bazarin to speak. ”1 read this morning in the pa- per," began Bazarin, “that the central office is investigating the disappear- ance of Felix Raydon. It occurred to me that I might be able to give you some information of use to you. I think that Mr. Halifax and I were, perhaps, the last persons to speak to him before he left his flat. Mr. Hali- fax is my secretary.” ‘‘It is very kind of you, Doctor Baza- rin, to come forward like this,” said the officer. “To know that we are en- gaged on a job is enough to make most people affect a' profound ignorance about it. And then they blame us be- cause we so often fail.” Bazarin smiled faintly. “I appre- ciate your difficulties," he said, “be- cause I am not ignorant of them. When I was a young man I did a lot of in- vestigation work for the New Orleans police. I think I can claim some share in the solution of the Villefoot and Taverne Royale mysteries." “So they told me at headquarters.” said the man, with a glance of respect- ful admiration. “A very clever bit of work that was.”	* “Perhaps that is why my sympathies are all with you," continued Bazarin. “And, perhaps, because I know that if I give you all the information in my power at this time you will leave me in peace later on. I am a very busy man, you know." “I know. I know. As I said, you are very kind.” “First 01 all, have you formed any theory about Ray don's disappearance?” “To tell the truth,” replied Hibbert, “we have scarcely started on the case yet. \\ e have very little to go on. you know. Men about town have beer, known before now to go away without leaving an address." And he smiled. “They have been forced into it." Bazarin stopped with a quiet gesture the detective’s words of repudiation. “Well, I knew Raydon as a patient, and as an occasional social companion. I met him at Newport several years ago. We were staying at the same hotel. One night he had a slight seizure and I examined him. I found him suffering from a somewhat unique cardiac af- fection, which interested me intensely, and I took many opportunities of watching its progress." Bazarin se- lected a cigarette from a silver box and lighted it. “Help yourself," he said, pushing the box toward the detective. “Well, 011 the afternoon of the seventh, I think it was, I met Raydon in upper Broadway. He told me that he was leaving for Europe the next day, or as soon as the ship 011 which he bad en- gaged passage should sail. That eve- ning I chanced to be near his apartment, and I made up my mind to call on him, and if possible to persuade him to al- low me to examine him again before he went. I did call on him and found him and Mr. Halifax together. Mr. Halifax shortly after took his leave, and I remained about a quarter of an hour with Raydon. I did not examine him. He objected to what he described as my fussing round him. Moreover, he told me that he was expecting friends, and he was obviously anxious for me to go." 1% TOP-NOTCH MAGAZINE ’’These friends clirl not put in an ap- pearance,” observed the detective. “No. Almost immediately, it must have been, after my departure, Mr. Halifax returned to the apartment for his walking stick, which he had left. He could get no reply to his knock, and, finding the door open, he entered. The apartment was empty. That is correct, is it not, Mr. Halifax?” Halifax bowed. “Quite correct.” “You knew Mr. Raydon intimately?” Hibbert asked Halifax. “I was well acquainted with him. His wife and I have known each other all our lives.” “You ought to know,” said Bazarin, speaking confidentially, “that Raydon was a brute to his wife. On the few occasions when I met Mrs. Raydon I saw that she was unhappy. Mr. Hali- fax called on Raydon that evening to remonstrate with him.” “How did he take your remon- strance, Mr. Halifax?” “He told me to mind my own busi- ness,” Halifax replied. Did he mention that he was leav- ing the country?” “He did. I tried to persuade him not to go.” “You wanted him to stay in New York ?” “1 wanted him to stay with his wife. On several occasions he has gone away and left her without warning.” “Have you seen Mrs. Raydon since her husband’s disappearance?” “Yes, once or twice.” “When was the last occasion?” Halifax hesitated. Bazarin was look- ing at him with a triumphant smile. 1 he thought flashed through Halifax’s brain that to get this information was the only reason why he had summoned the detective. He must have known that these questions would be asked, l'he detective’s keen eyes were on Hali- fax, and he blurted out: “About ten days ago. I met her on Third Avenue.” “Where is she living, may 1 ask?” “I have no idea.” “You don’t know where she is?” “No, I don’t, nor does anybody else so far as I am aware.” Mr. Hibbert stroked his mustache. “What do you make of it?’’ asked Bazarin. “Queer,” muttered the detective. “We must find Mrs. Raydon.” '‘Yes, you must find Mrs. Raydon,” and there was a note of cruel eager- ness in Bazarin’s voice. Halifax knew that the man was rejoicing because the police were going to aid him in his search. “I don’t see how in the slight- est she can help you to find her hus- band,” he blurted out. “That remains to be seen.” The de- tective glanced meaningly at Bazarin, who nodded in reply. A child could have read the minds of both men. The crafty look that passed between them revealed their thoughts. An icy hand seemed to grip Halifax’s heart. A numb feeling of horror seized his limbs so that they trembled as with an ague. The de- tective suspected Elise of doing away with her husband! And what was worse, Bazarin was encouraging the suspicion. The flattering glances of understanding which he had thrown across to the detective made that man nod his head sagely. “Great Heaven!” Halifax stam- mered. “You don’t mean to suggest that-” Again the detective looked toward Bazarin. “No, no, Mr. Halifax, of course not," he said hurriedly; “of course not.” “I am glad to hear it!’’ Halifax ex- claimed bitterly. “1 could imagine nothing more absurdly unjust and foolish.” “Well,” interrupted Bazarin smoothly, “you have heard our story. SECRET SUPREME 197 I don't think that we have omitted anything. If we can be of any further use to you we shall at all times be glad to hear from you. But, as you see, our knowledge of Raydon and his move- ments is of the slightest. He was-er -not altogether a desirable acquaint- ance. My interest in him was only of a professional nature.” “I understand. I am very much obliged, Doctor Bazarin, for your kind- ness. I will detain you no longer.” The detective picked up bis hat. “Good evening, sir. Good evening, Mr. Hali- fax. I am obliged to you, too.” Halifax ignored the outstretched hand. He hated the man with all his heart. “Good evening,” he said curtly. At that moment there was a com- motion in the street. A hard, jarring sound as of an automobile brought to a sudden stop by the hasty application of the brakes met their ears, followed by a shout and a cry of pain. Bazarin went to the window and pulled the blinds. “Somebody run over!” he exclaimed. Halifax and the detective joined him at the window. A small group of peo- ple had hurriedly gathered round a taxicab, and from its midst was dragged the unconscious body of a youth and the remains of what had been a bicycle. The youth was laid gently on the pavement, while some one ran off for a policeman. The chauffeur stood, gesticulating frantically, on the fringe of the little group of people. “I’ll be off,” said Hibbert, making for the door. “Maybe I can be of use.” But Bazarin was before him. Hali- fax watched him with amazement as he ran across the room. The eager- ness of his pace was not that of a med- ical man on his way to render help to an injured fellow creature. His face shone with the delirious excitement that had seized him when he had en- tered Raydon's flat, and found on the floor the body of its late occupant. Halifax followed him with beating heart. In the twinkling of an eye Bazarin was in the street. He pushed his way unceremoniously through the crowd. 1 hen he bent over the figure lying on the pavement. The policeman who had hurried up recognized Bazarin and took command. “Stand back, there,” he cried peremp- torily, “and give the doctor room.” 1 hen he saw Hibbert and nodded to him. The chauffeur noticed this and addressed his protestations to the de- tective. “He didn’t have no light,” he cried ex- citedly. “As sure as I’m standin’ here, he didn't have no light. It wasn’t my fault. He ain’t dead, is he, mister?” At that moment the policeman, hav- ing driven back the bystanders, turned his attention to the chauffeur and pro- duced his notebook. Bazarin straightened his back, and glanced round him. “Come here, Halifax, and you, Hib- bert,” he said shortly. “Help me to carry this fellow’ into my house. Look sharp!” Gentlv they raised the unconscious youth and bore him up the steps and into the hall. “Into the library and on the sofa!” commanded Bazarin. and 4hev obeyed. “Ring up for an ambulance,” he said, “and leave me-both of you.” Both Halifax and the detective hes- itated, and Bazarin pointed angrily to the door. “Do you hear me?" he said, in a voice that commanded obedience. “Leave the room!” They turned awray in amazement. The telephone was in an alcove in the hall, and while Halifax searched for the number of the nearest hospital, Hib- bert found his voice. “He’s a corker, and no mistake.” he said. “Not many doctors would bother themselves like this, let alone a chap of Bazarin’s posi- 198 TOP-NOTCH MAGAZINE tion. But what does he want an am- bulance for? The poor fellow’s as dead as a doornail.” “Are you sure?" Halifax asked. “Of course I am. He’s dead and done for." Halifax found the number, and with the receiver in his hand he paused. Bazarin’s order for an ambulance to be called was a pretext to get them out of the room-of that Halifax felt certain. He gave the number and instructions and hung up. “Let us wait in the drawing-room," he said to Hibbert. “Perhaps you are wrong. He may not be dead.” Halifax feared what was happening in the library, and what Bazarin might be doing. In the drawing-room Hib- bert paced up and down, examining the paintings, and now and again throwing out a remark. “Have you been here long, Mr. Hali- fax. may f ask?" he inquired. “No, not long.” “It must be very interesting being here,” he went on. “You must see all sorts of funny cases, and so on." “I see none of the cases. I have nothing whatever to do with Doctor Bazarin’s professional work.” “Then you aren't in the medical line yourself?” “No.” “I have a son at the Roosevelt Hos- pital," volunteered Hibbert genially. “You see all sorts of queer cases there. You get used to it, I suppose. I’ve seen Harry tackle a street accident as calm as you like. It was on Central Park West, just in front of the- Century Theater. Man killed, too. And here’s Doctor Bazarin getting as excited as- But I suppose he’s not used to accidents.” “No, he’s not. They’re not in his line,” Halifax said hurriedly. “Just as I thought. You see, it’s all a matter of use. Now. this Raydon business- What’s that?" 1 le broke off. A strange, choking, gasping sound met their ears. It seemed to come from the library. Hali- fax gripped the back of the chair he was holding so fiercely that his nails seemed to enter into the wood. For it was the same ominous sound as he had heard twice at the house in the Bronx. “What did you hear?" he asked, and the words had scarcely escaped his lips when he heard the sound again. He could control himself no longer. Here might be an opportunity of solving the riddle that had perplexed him for so long. “Wait here a moment," he said abruptly, and left the room, shutting the door after him. The library door was also shut, but he knew that there was a screen inside the room and in front of the door. So he turned the handle quietly and en- tered the library. Bazarin was leaning over the couch, and the man who had been run over was hid from his view. Nor could he see what Bazarin was doing. Suddenly the horrible sound, as if all the breath in a man’s body was being forced out in painful explosions, broke out again. The sound came from the body on the couch ! And then he saw a limb jerk itself out and as suddenly come back into position. Bazarin moved aside a little, and Halifax caught a glimpse of the ob- ject of his attention. The man was pale as death, his eyes were fixed and staring, there was a ghastly blue wound on his forehead. It was the form of a dead man. But his limbs, were twitching, his hands, hanging over the edge of the couch, moved now and again with odd, spasmodic jerks. “He’s not dead, after all,” breathed a voice in Halifax’s ear. It was Hibbert. He had crept in after him, and stood watching. With a quick movement Bazarin SECRET SUPREME faced round. For a moment Halifax thought he was going to turn upon them with a torrent of abuse. His mouth was working with suppressed rage. “You-” he began. Then he wheeled round. Evidently it was his intention to hide bis passion from them. “Has the ambulance come?” he asked. “Then he’s not dead?” said Hibbert. “Yes, he's dead." “But-” “He is dead, I tell you,” repeated Bazarin. “Look for yourself.” Hibbert did so, and nodded wonder- ingly. Halifax glanced at Bazarin. His eyes were glowing with excite- ment. But it was his coat that at- tracted Halifax’s attention. Down on the front had been spilled a quantity of fine brown snufflike powder. CHAPTER XII. T TIE PROBLEM OF ELISE. YV^HEN Lieutenant Hibbert left Bazarin’s house that night, Hali- fax could see that he was preoccupied. The strange incident of the evening had puzzled the detective. Halifax did not know what were his thoughts, for, on the few occasions on which he ad- dressed him, he did so abruptly and in a strange manner. Bazarin went out of his way to make much of the central-office man. When the cyclist bad been taken away he pressed the detective to have a glass of wine. But Hibbert refused, a trifle curtly. Bazarin was quite at his ease, and, presently excusing himself, went away on the pretext of calling on a patient, and immediately after the de- tective also took his leave. Halifax did not sleep much that night. When he dozed off it was to dream such horrors as made him wake up in terror. When he looked at his face in the mirror in the morning it was pale and haggard, and there were heavy black lines round his eyes. When he went downstairs he heard that Bazarin had left the house, and that he would not be back for two days. When, later on in the morning, no pa- tients arrived, instead of the usual morning’s flow of arrivals, Halifax sur- mised that Bazarin had planned his de- parture the night before, and had found time to cancel all his appointments by letter. For a moment Halifax wondered why Bazarin had done this without telling him. It was part of his work to attend to such matters as the post- poning of appointments. And then he thought it probable that the doctor had been none too pleased with his inter- ference with him on the previous night, and that he wished to keep his doings secret from his secretary. It was all conjecture, and Halifax's brain was too tired to tackle any more mysteries. While he was busying himself in the morning with his few duties, a telegram arrived for him. “Come and see me as soon as possible,” it read, and it was signed “Martin.’’ The telegram aroused a hundred speculations in Halifax’s mind, and he could scarcely wait till the hour when he might leave the house. At the earliest moment he hailed a cab and drove down to Martin's office. Martin was out at lunch, and Halifax awaited his return with much impa- tience. When he came into the room, Halifax could see by his face that he had news for him. “I got your wire.” be said. “And here I am." “Is it you or your shadow?” he ex- claimed. “Good Lord. man. you are wasting away!” “I’m all right.” the other replied tartly, for the sight of the healthy glow- on Martin’s cheeks, and his general air of prosperity and contentment, made him feel all the w’orse. There is nothing so annoying to a man who is 200 TOP-NOTCH MAGAZINE worried as to see another who is not. *Tm all right. What is it?” “I’ve run Mrs. Raydon to earth!” "Nor “Yes, I have. So you are not going to have it your own way, after all. More than that. I’m not going to lose her now that I have found her." “1 hope not," Halifax said. “Where is she ? How did you find her ? What is she doing?” "Sit down, and light up, and I'll tell you all about it." Martin set the example and lighted a cigar. He sat down at his desk, which he graced with his legs, and be- gan: “W hen you told me that she had left Mrs. Oppenshaw’s, I took the lib- erty of calling upon that lady. I found that Mrs. Raydon had taken with her a very few articles in a small bag, and that she possessed not more than five dollars.” “Well?” Halifax put in between his teeth, for Martin paused. “Five dollars goes such a very short way that it seemed more than likely to me that Mrs. Raydon would try to get employment. She would not again, I thought, risk starving with a friend. While Mrs. Oppenshaw then undertook to find out as delicately as possible from those whom she knew to be Mrs. Ray- don’s friends if they knew where the lady was, I set myself the task of try- ing to find out where she might be seek- ing employment. I advertised.” “In what way?” “In several papers I advertised for a lady companion.” “You did!” “Yes. 1 described myself as a mid- dle-aged lady, lonely, fond of bright, companionable society. I mentioned that 1 was about to’ travel abroad. I offered fifty dollars a month, all found. I flatter myself that the bait was at- tractive.” “And did Elise apply?” Halifax asked eagerly. “No, she didn’t. I had in all over three hundred applications from bright, companionable ladies of ages ranging from fifteen to fifty. About two hun- dred and fifty of them were clearly not written by Mrs. Raydon. I was not sure about the other fifty, for, of course, she was, 1 suspected, certain to take another name. I interviewed this fifty personally. My office during last week was like a matrimonial agency or a school for dramatic culture. It has been a joke, but a melancholy kind of joke. I had to explain to all these ladies that my client had been suited. Except in a few instances, it was a mean job.” “But tell me about Elise. I don’t want to hear about these other people.” “Nobody ever does want to hear of the other people, Jim. Well, I’m coming to Mrs. Raydon. I read the other night in one of the evening papers, that seems to spot, as if by instinct, the true value of things-at least it did in this case- that a lady, while playing with two small children in Gramercy Park, slipped and injured her ankle. She fainted with the pain, and the children could not tell where they lived, so all three were taken to the hospital. I think the paragraph was headed, ‘Boy of seven does not know his address/ or words to that effect. The paragraph stated that the woman was married, and went on to describe her, and somehow the description made me think of Mrs. Raydon. I called at the hospital the next morning and found that she had been discharged. After recovering from their fright, the children had re- membered their address, and thither the ladv had been sent. That was the next place to call. The house was one of those big, gloomy mansions, whose better days are buried in the past. There was a ticket above the door, ‘Board and Lodging/ and a foreign manservant opened the door.” Halifax tried his best to possess him- SECRET SUPREME 201 self in patience while Martin went on with the story, the recital of which he seemed to be enjoying. “The lady of the house-her name is Stringer, and she looks it-was very pleasant to me at first. But when she discovered that I did not wish to take up my abode with her she cooled off. And when I mentioned the injured lady, she was positively offensive. She said a lot of things about being bothered with other people’s troubles, which I did not listen to. I learned that the lady with the broken ankle had a few days previously entered into the ex- cessively bright duties of looking after two brats-I’ve seen them-in return for her board and lodging and fifteen dollars a month. I needn’t go into that, for I can see it hurts. It made me mad. I saw the lady-she was sitting up in the dingy parlor-and I nearly embraced Mrs. Stringer in my joy, for the lady was Mrs. Raydon!’’ Halifax gripped the arm of his chair the tighter. “Go on,” he muttered. “Go on.” “To relieve your mind, let me say at once that Mrs. Raydon has prom- ised me on her word of honor to re- main in the house till she is quite better, and she remains as a paying boarder. It took a devil of a lot of persuading.” Martin grinned. “And where is this house?” Halifax asked eagerly. “That I cannot tell you.” “You cannot tell me!” “No, in my turn I had to promise that.” “You mean to say that Elise made you promise not to tell me where she was living?" “I do. In order that you may not flatter yourself unduly, I may add that the same restriction applies to every- body.” “But why?” Halifax demanded. Martin grew serious. “That is what I want you to tell- me, old boy,” he said. “I've had a long talk with Mrs. Raydon. She was not quite her usual self. She was overwrought and-and less restrained-and she, in a manner, let fall some words that she has hith- erto been at pains to keep back. She has put into my mind the suspicion that not only is Bazarin an active enemy of hers, but that you are aiding and abet- ting him-not willfully maybe, but at least unconsciously.” “Good heavens, Martin! Do you mean to say that I would-” “Wait a moment, old man.” He rose and put his hands on Halifax’s shoulders, looking into his eyes. “I want you to be absolutely open and aboveboard with me. You must be, do you understand? If not for your own sake, then for the sake of the girl who is suffering a Hades of terror and suspense. You can trust me. I give you my word that I shall respect your confidences. But I give you my word also that if you don’t tell me all that is in your mind I'll find it out for my- self, and, by the Lord Harry, I’ll have no pity for you then.’’ Martin was a man of Halifax’s own age. In the old days Halifax had found it not difficult to exercise a supremacy over him, but at the moment his per- sonality dominated Doctor Bazarin’s secretary. “All that is in my mind,” he re- peated hoarsely. “That is what I said. I’m sorry to say it, Jim, but you haven’t played the game up to now. I’m convinced you haven’t. Tell me about this Bazarin, for Heaven’s sake, and let us get on the right track. If this business is not set- tled quickly-” He shrugged his shoulders. “Yes. If it isn’t?” “Mrs. Raydon will die.” “You don’t mean that, man? You don’t mean it. Tell me you don’t mean it!” Halifax gripped him by the arm and his hand shook. 202 TOP-NOTCH MAC',AZINE "But I do. I am certain of it," Mar- tin replied quietly. “The doctor whom I sent to her tells me that she is on the verge of mental collapse. This acci- dent has been the culminating blow. You don’t need to ask me what it is I am afraid of.” Halifax moistened his lips with his tongue. “But I know nothing that will set her mind at rest,” he said. “I know next to nothing of Bazarin. The little I know is mere suspicion. I am myself trying to find out more.” "What are you trying to find out?” Martin had cast aside the easy and flip- pant manner with which he had told Halifax he had found Elise. That had been part of his plan to set him at ease, to coax his confidence. Now he spoke sternly. “I shall tell you when I have found it out. For pity's sake. Martin,” Hali- fax pleaded, “let me do this part of the work by myself.” “I will not.” He spoke quietly, so quietly that Halifax glanced at him in surprise. His face was pale with the force of his de- termination. It was the face of a man who has set himself a task to do that he will die rather than leave undone. Suddenly a gust of jealousy swept through Halifax's brain. He flushed crimson with anger, and, banging his fist on the desk, he shouted: “I see through you now. You-you are in love with Elise! You want to win-” “Silence!” Still Martin’s voice was quiet, but imperious. “If I happened to be in love with Elise-as you are- I should do anything-anything in the world-to save her one hour’s anxiety such as she is enduring at present. Jim.” His voice became soft. “You are not yourself, or you would never have said this. I am not in love with Elise Raydon. You hear?” For Hali- fax was standing as if thinking of something else. "I am not in love with her. But you are, and you always will be, and if you play the coward now you will regret it as long as you live.” He was silent. Halifax turned from him to bide his agitation. Gazing into the fire, he said griinlv and determin- edly: “Martin!” “Yes, Jim?” “Von said you would do anything- anything in the world, didn't you?” “I did,” he replied firmly. “You said also that you would re- spect my confidences.” “Yes, on my word of honor, I will.” “Well, you needn't do that. You can give me away if it will do Elise any good. After what 1 am going to tell you. you must act as seems best for Elise. You will promise me that?” “I do promise you ” A note of won- der, almost of fear, crept into his voice. “Very well.” Halifax suddenly faced him. For a moment the room seemed to be going round him. Then he said firmly: "I did it, Tack-I killed Felix Rav- don.” Martin gazed at his friend, horrified, without speaking. “Say something!” Halifax cried. “For Heaven’s sake, speak! Did you hear me? I killed him ! Now. what are you going to do?” Hali- fax laughed hysterically. The sound of bis own laughter filled him with horror. “Speak, Martin, what are you going to do?” CHAPTER XIII. SEEKING THE WAY. JMARTIN stepped forward a little. and Halifax, even in his excite- ment, could see that he was trembling somewhat. “Come, Jim,” he said, and his voice shook, “you don’t know what you are saying. You are-you are not yourself. Sit down, old man, and let “And I declare to you,”-Halifax said as calmly as he could, “that I am tell- SECRET SUPREME 203 ing you the truth. I killed Felix Ray- don. 1 called on him, as you know, and you know also why I callcd on him. He provoked me beyond endur- ance, and I struck him. It wasn’t much of a blow, Jack,” he went on, pleading with the man who stood staring at him, with blanched face. “I didn’t mean to kill him. But he fell-and then-I knew-” There was a long silence, and Mar- tin’s horrified eyes seemed to burn into Halifax’s very soul. Then he sank down at his desk and covered his face with his hands. His distress had the effect of pulling the other together. Halifax's compassion for him made him forget himself. “Jack,” he said, shaking Martin by the shoulders, "Jack, please don’t go on like that. It doesn't matter. I mean I can stand it. If you give me up to the police I shall understand. It’s for her sake, isn't it? Jack, I beg of you, speak to me.” Martin raised his eyes to Halifax, and in that moment his friend knew, if he had never really known before, how good a friend Martin was to him. There was an agony of apprehension in Martin’s eyes. "Give you up!” he breathed. "My God!” And Halifax knew that he was safe. Strangely enough, he was not satisfied. He had unburdened himself of his dread sccret. and now he wanted some- thing to happen-something that would relieve the tension of his mind. Mar- tin's weakness, somehow, gave him a feeling of strength. “Then you are not going to give me up,” and Halifax smiled as he spoke. “He deserved it, you know, although I didn’t mean it. He was a scoundrel.” He paused a moment, and then added quizzically: “I didn’t mean to hit so hard.” “Don’t, man; don’t speak of it.” “But we must speak of it now, old boy, mustn’t we? You are now an ac- cessory after tl^ fact, or whatever you call it, aren’t you? You made me speak, you know. We’re both in the soup. Come.” He shook him again. "Curse me or tell me to get out or call a police- man. Do something, or, by Heaven, I shall do something myself! Don’t you understand how I feel; how I have felt all these weeks?” “All these weeks!” he repeated. Then, “Jim/’ he said, "where is it?” “It?” “Raydon ?” “At Bazarin’s house, in the Bronx.” “In Bazarin’s house.” He started up. “What do you mean ?” And then Halifax told him all. How he had returned to the flat to find the body of Raydon gone and Bazarin, too: how he had discovered Raydon dead or alive in the house in the Bronx; how he had heard mysterious sounds and seen sights which made him shiver to describe. “He is still there for all I know,” he concluded. “I meant to find out more for myself, but you forced me to tell you all to-dav. What Bazarin is doing, Heaven knows! What evil trick he is playing is a mystery to me.” TO BE CONTINUED. The succeeding chapters of this novel, begin- ning with Chapter XIV., following an interest- ing sketch of all that has gone before, introduced for new readers, will appear in the next issue of TOP-NOTCH, dated and out November 1st. It began in the October 1st issue. Back numbers may be obtained from news dealers or the pub- lishers.	_ Speaking of Brains ‘Y’ES,” said the newspaper reporter, “I always carry my notes in my hat." “I see,” replied Fogg; "news in a nutshell.” _ Not in His Duties DOSS: “I wanted to speak to you, Mr. Lovum, about your attentions to Miss Sweett during office hours. I engaged you as billing clerk only; no cooing mentioned. That will be all for the present.” FOR INSTANCE, “THE OLD, OLD CALL.” HAT is the title of a story in the next issue of Top- Notch, but it serves very well for the title of the little talk that I have for you just now. The tale is from the pen of a man who has distinguished himself as a writer of stories about the war-Brit- ten Austin. His has been the art of looking into the hearts of fighters, and finding there, whatever side they might be battling for, the human qualities that make the whole race akin. These qual- ities are the ones that draw the writer and editor irresistibly toward the vast conflict as a background or a motif for fiction tales that take on the feeling of these world-stirring, world-enlighten- ing times. Men in the street stop each other and ask what it’s all leading to? One favorite conundrum is: After the war, is man in the aggregate going to slip back into his old indifference to- ward man in the aggregate? ITere is a favorite riddle, which the commuter may put to himself while running for a train: After citizens arc through dying for their countries, are the countries going to concern them- selves more-through the laws-with the things that make it possible for citi- zens to live. The newspaper headlines of the day answer the questions with their reality. Some of our wide-awake magazine writers are seeing in these answers good suggestions for stories. They are enterprising writers who are given to peeping beyond the visible hori- zon and putting what they see into stories. Some wide-awake ones are content to spin their yarns of what is on the visible horizon; of what the war is throwing up to the eye. We like to get hold of both types of war stories for Top-Notch, and when they are up to the standard in story strength, we take them and print them for the entertainment of our read- ers. They must have that quality first of all-the quality of entertainment. But if there should underlie something more, we are not frightened. If you’ve got a cracking good story lo offer, don’t be afraid of sending it to Top-Notch. even if it has a little way with it that is worth while, even if it does cause you to smile when some people think that with more propriety you might, frown. COMETHING MOMENTOUS.” This is the leading novel of the next issue-author, Eugene A. Clancy-and one of those war tales that gaze ahead. It had a forward look at the time it was written; but who knows that at this moment it is doing anything more than telling what has happened? Mag- azines, you know, are printed quite a long time in advance of the date they bear. Well, this “Something Mo- mentous” has a lot to do with the ad- ventures of the renowned Camera Chap, Frank Hawley, and adventures that are bound up dramatically with the events that are thrilling all the conti- TOP-NOTCI-I TALK 205 nents. It is the biggest task in picture taking ever undertaken by the Camera Chap or any other chap. Sport Stories.-One of these is a novelette of unusual length-a good long read for you. It is a medley of magic and track running called “Magic Grips.” Charles T. JordaiY is the author. The baseball story of the next issue is a clever bit by that old-time Top-Notch favorite, Harold C. Burr. “Not for Keeps” is the title. There are some laughs in this, as well as some serious moments. “When the Loser Scored” is the title of a sport tale which William Wallace Cook contributes' to . the next number; one of the brightest -tories in the issue. Do athletes who in their palmy days meet with a reverse- a serious one-ever come back? Some people hold that they do not. Read what Chief Bender, of the Philadelphia Nationals, has to s’ay about it in rela- tion to ball players. He has given a de- „ cidedly interesting talk to J. C. Kofoed. Splendid Tale of the Navy.-Here is one to take you captive. It is by H. A. Lamb, and is called "Mystic Lights.” Some sport in this, too, come to think. A bully boat race with jackies as the contestants. Shorter Stories.-There is a big lot of them-too many to mention in de- tail. But they are as good a lot all round as we have managed to get hold of for some time. Among the authors of them are Ralph Cummins, of pic- ture-play story distinction: Howard Dwight Smiley, Ima Nutt, Harold de Polo, with Mark Allerton and Burt L. Standish coming in strong with two big serial novels. Points for California. A LETTER in rebuttal-to use a lawyer’s term-has been received from Mr. F. A. Schliemann, of Spapks, Nevada, in regard to certain statements about California made in this magazine by Miss Hoover, who gave us an inter- esting account of her motor-cycle trip. In the course of his letter, Mr, Schlie- mann says: Will you permit an old-time reader to come again? I come more in praise than anything else. T consider the September 1st issue especially good. "A Bit of All Right," and the serials by the Dorrances and Cook deserve especial praise, to my notion. Would it be possible to get a continuation of the Boltwood stories? Or has Boltwood gone “Somewhere in France,” so his biog- rapher can get no more data on him? Now, in regard to my former letter: If Miss Hoover will tell where those "deserts" were, or through what counties she passed that "one hundred miles” without meeting aught but vultures skimming the sky. or a chance lizard panting in the heat, I am willing to let all the rest of the questions go. I know there are people living in Cali- fornia, called Californians sometimes, who like to refer to the Sacramento Valley and northern California as sterile and desert, which is very far from the truth. There are some three million acres of arsble land in the Sacramento Valley alone. An eight-million- dollar rice crop, a ten-million-dollar bean crop, a bumper fruit crop, a shipment of six thousand cars of oranges will give you some idea of its fertility. Were it not for the wide range of Tor- Notch readers, 1 would simply have laughed at the letter and let it go. I have seen Top- Notch everywhere-on the professor’s table, and on the roustabout’s bunk, and any one. not knowing better, reading that letter would believe there was a good-sized desert in northern California. I shall always hold my opinion about Western courtesy. I hold no brief for whisky, nor do I want to.

'T'O James French Dorrance, the pop- ular author, we are indebted for a newspaper clipping which chimes in with the little story about Cheyenne’s Frontier week, which we publish in this issue under title of “The Uncurried West.’’ Mr. Dorrance writes from Car- pentaria, Santa Barbara County, Cali- fornia. and says; The inclosed clipping tells us that one of the women who participated in Cheyenne’s Frontier Week has already paid the penalty of the strenuous life.

Considerable has been said in these pages about the habit reality has shown of imitating romance. It is becoming scandalous. No sooner does an author think up some remarkable event and give it a fictional setting than along comes real life and palms it off as its own. Nothing can be done about it, of course. No copyright holds against reality. Here is the clipping: DENVER, Col., Aug. 27.-“Well, I rode her!" were the dying words of Mrs. Ed. Wright, champion woman roughridcr of the world, when she was picked up at Union Park here, after heing thrown by a wild horse during a field-day celebration for the benefit of Colorado National Guardsmen, en- camped here. Mrs. Wright died before she reached a hospital.

Mrs. Wright succeeded in sub- duing her mount from its furious bucking, but Gentle Annie started on a wild gallop toward a corral. Before the cowboys, who immediately started in pursuit, could catch the fleeing horse, the animal plunged through a wire fence, stumbled and slid along the ground with Mrs. Wright still in the saddle. A part of the saddle caught in the fence, and the broncho raised ils heels in the air, and then fell to the ground again. As it rose it stepped on the woman’s face, crushing her skull. liditor uf Top-Notch Magazine.

N. that I would walk to New York after it. Well, anyway. I have been a steady reader since seeing a copy for the first time-January, 1016. It contained the story. “Ranch Magic,” showing the picture of the mule. I thought to myself: There’s some- thing different. It sure was. and I have found a different and better class of stories than are found in other magazines I have read. I have no special favorites among vi»ur writers; they are all good. But 1 am going to kick about “Rogues of the Round-up,’’ by Herbert Coolidge, when he mentioned the Salt Lake City stampede as being loaded. I can’t see on what ground he has that to say about the stampede at Salt Lake. The stampedes are held every year at the State Fair Grounds at Salt Lake City in connection with the annual State Fair, under a com- mittee selected by the State, and this com- mittee is composed of fair-minded men. I am sure all other Utah readers of T. N. will agree with me. I think those “Little Stories from Top- Notch Readers" a good addition to your magazine, as long as they are actual experi- TOP-NOTCH TALK 207 ences. Also your “Talks" are interesting. I would like to see a story written by one of your excellent writers about the West, using Utah as the scene of action. It is some time since we received a story laid in Utah that seemed up to the standard. As to the West in gen- eral, you will find in this issue some good tales colored with the life of that region. Top-Notch aims to keep up the name it has made for printing good Western stories. Mr. Larsen said sev- eral things in his letter, and one'of them was: “There’s something different.” We are striving to produce a magazine that will evoke that remark from every one who reads it. To break away from the hackneyed, the outworn, in fiction is one of the chief aims of Top-Notch writers and editors. Editor of Top-Notch Magazine. Dear Sir: I have read many magazines, but never one with such a fine assortment of stories as yours. My favorite writers are Standish, Kahler, Holden, and La Due. “Why Not?” written by Holden, was a clever story, which I thoroughly enjoyed. Well, “Mr. Trout’s Mistake” was a great one, only it made one feel sorry when he was caught. I hope you will give us more track and swimming tales, for they surely are good.

It is a pleasure to announce that in the next issue there will be a good sea yarn, and that our friend on the Illinois will find it when he opens his copy of T. N. We are always reaching after sea yarns that we think will pass the muster of our friends in the navy all over the world; but we regret that our reaching in this direction is not often repaid with the kind of stories that we deem good enough to use. ■ A Boost from Canada.
