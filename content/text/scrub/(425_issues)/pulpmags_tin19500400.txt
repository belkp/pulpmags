when bridger was posted missing over a volcanic planetoid
it looked like curtains  but two interplanetary pros-
pectors had a hunch  

and jimmy briscoe setting out in search of
the missing man

  ken brought the craft lower over the
fiery planetoid and noted with satisfaction
that the grav meter indicated a gravity
roughly that of the earth at least there
would be no tricky complications in land-
ing the planetoid seemed to consist of a
series of horseshoe-shaped valleys three
sides of which were bounded by craggy
black rock formations dripping with mois-
ture while from the valleys themselves rose
ruddy-tinted vapor the higher ground
scored by cracks and crevices was cooled-off
lava but the sloping ground on the open
side of the valleys was covered with a dense
black vegetation

heres vegetable life here anyway
remarked jimmy as the cruiser
circled lower and that suggests animal
life i wonder what forms exist here

  well soon know replied ken the
atmosphere reads ok so well land we
wont even have to put on our spacesuits
ken jimmys voice became a yell his
plump face was alive with excitement as he
pointed through the glastic screen swing
her round back to that valley theres a
small spacecruiser there-old bridgers
quickly ken turned the craft peering
through the screen and saw the space-
cruiser its long blue body unmistakably
that of henry bridgers craft

  cut in the antigrav he rapped out
and when his co-pilot obeyed the space-
cruiser hovered over the valley and then
under the controlling lever which gradually
increased the gravity pull it siowly descend-
ed through the eddying mists and came to
rest a few yards from the abandoned craft

  cautiously jimmy opened the air-lock
and sniffed whew its hot was his com-
ment stinks of sulphur too

  atmosphere almost the same as earths
according to the meter said ken he led
the way out into the open and for a moment
they stood gasping in the intense humidity
sweat rolling down their faces they
moved over the hot ground to the other
spacecruiser and opened its airlock

r bridger ken called loudly into
the craft but the only response was
the metallic echo of his own voice he
climbcd inside opened the studded door
to the rear compartment but there was no
sign of its owner a brief examination of
the spaceradio transmitter repealed that it
was in order nothing doin he an-
nounced returning to the waiting jimmy
everything is in order in the craft hes
simply walked out and never came back

  he eyed the smoking steaming crevices
and the glow from a great lake of fire which
stretched across the sloping entrance to the
valley if he left the valley on foot he must
have somehow got across that lake he
said slowly he moved warily towards the
lake approaching as closely as the heat
would permit and for some moments the
two young adventurers stood eyeing the
awesome sight the white-hot bubbling lava
from which an occasional pillar of flame
shot skywards giving an eerie effect of
sluggish lightning in the sombre steaming
valley from the lake a stream of lava
about ten feet across white hot at first but
cooling to a dull red the further it flowed
from the lake ran down to the rocky boun-
daries of the valley and gurgled away
through crevices in the wall apparently to
return to the molten interior of the fiery
planetoid and again to be thrown up into
the boiling lake

  doesnt seem to be any life here mut-
tered jimmy uneasily glancing around
not that you can see much inside the val-
ley thanks to the mists

  they moved around the fringe of the
lake picking their way among pillars of
congealed lava which rose like the trunks
of dead trees from the floor of the valley

hpheres the answer said ken tri-
a umphantly the lava lake ends a
few yards short of the other wall old
bridger left the valley this way

  across the narrow strip of rock between
the lake and frowning cliffs was a gently
rising slope thick with the queer black
vegetation they had observed from above

  wait jimmy grasped his friends arm
 theres something moving over there i
 saw those leaves move and theres no wind
 here ill swear theres    great heavens

 what is it

  ken stared at the nightmare shape emerg-
 ing from the black-leaved forest first came
 the head about the size of a bulls but
 globular and possessing three eyes set in
 deep black hollows no doubt as a protection
 aoainst the heat in this environment one in
 the upper centre of the face and one on
 either side obviously the depth of the eye-
 sockets prevented side vision a lack which
 was compensated for by the two side eyes
 the mouth was a loosely triangular-shaped
 aperture surrounded by horny ndgcs and
 the whole face was covered with thick black
 scales the body too about the size of a
 small elephant was covered with gleaming
 black scales and was supported by hind legs
 short and thick which ended in great
 splayed hoofs but the forelegs were slimmei
 and supple looking and were more like arms
 in that they possessed a mass of man-
 jointed fingers

 as they watched the strange creature i
 sat back on its hind legs and using us
 forepaws as hands commenced teanng at
 the foliage and stuffing it into its moiun

    its vegetarian at least whispered ke i

    might be yearning for a change of diet
 muttered jimmy look at those claws
 theyd rip a man to bits

   better get back muttered ken d
  feel safer with one of the atoblasters in my

  bathey turned and simultaneously they
  uttered gasps of dismay standing immobile
  in front of them evidently having emerged
  from the misty pair at the base of the cms
  was another of the weird monsters then
  slowly-its single front eye glowing redly n
  its blacksocket the beast advanced towards

  thetjolt said ken keep towards the
  rocks and away from the lake

    the two men shot to the side and raced
  in the general direction of their craftim-
  mediately the monster uttered a fnht
  ins bellow and the next moment the valley
  resounded with answering bellowmgs 
  golly the place is alive with em

  payesjly must have been crouched

over near the cliffs said ken well have
to keep out in the open after all

through the shifting haze the two men
saw the gleaming black shapes of the mon-
sters closing in on them the thudding foot-
steps of the lumbering beasts were close
behind them but ahead and visible now was
the spacecruiser ken was confident of
reaching it for the fiery monsters were com-
paratively sluggish runners but his eyes
fixed on the little craft suddenly dilated
with horror as two of the monsters lum-
bered across and stood directly in front of
the spacecruiser waiting

were done jimmy who had seen the
monsters cutting off their retreat uttered
the crv in despairing tones

   well have to make for the rocks after
all cricd ken they mightnt be able to
climb its our only chance jimmy

he could hear jimmys flying feet behind
him and the heavy thudding of the
dragon-like animals and then there came
a new sensation from high up on the clifl
face a bolt of white flame shot across his
head and the nearest of the pursuingmon-
sters uttered a maddened bellow of pam
and stopped dead a gaping smoking wound
in its thick hind leg

  ken stared upward and as the mist
shifted he saw a human face the face of an
elderly grey-haired man protruding from
one of the caves in the cliff side about fifty
yards further down

   down below me roared the man h
keep em off while you climb

   he underlined this statement with another
blast from his atoblaster and a second
monster roared with agony and fell out ot
the race ken ran along the base of the clitt
until he reached the spot directly below the
man and began clawing his way up the
irregular cliffs with the panting jmmy at
his heels another bolt from the atoblaster
although missing its objective checked the
rush of another of the brutes which had
reared up preparatory to lunging at the two
fleeing men

   ken drasged himself up into the cave
and sank down exhausted while jimmy
quivering in every ounce of his plump body
was assisted up by  their rescuer

   well said ken at last looking at the
grey-haired man this is almost as big ft

shock as the sight of those monsters mr
bridger we thought-well-

  thought  was finished eh the
director smiled  thought so myself for a
few hectic minutes a week ago the brutes
got between me and my craft and theyve
been camping at the foot of the cliffs in
relays ever since it is surprising what in-
telligence they possess they sit around al
the foot of cliffs all the time except when
they move off to feed which they take
in turn ive given a few of them some
wounds but thats all the atoblaster can
do-wound them their hides are like super- 
asbestos ive been stuck here all the week
living on concentrated food tablets and
catching what water i can from the rocks

  and now were all stuck here said
jimmy gloomily

  not at all corrected bridger there
are any number of crevices in the ceilings
of these caves leading to the open above
one man alone cant reach them but be-
tween us we should manage withoui am
trouble he stepped to the cave openinp
and peered below yes theyre all clustered
directly below our best plan is to move
now if we get out through the top here
and work our way around into the valley
from the other side we may find the space-
cruisers unguarded if there are a couple
of the creatures standing guard  think 
can account for them with the atoblaster
i suppose there is an entrance into th
valley from below

yes said ken eagerly and described

  j the strip of rock at the far end of the
lake giving access to the valley

  bridger led the way into the cave and
selected one of the cracks in the ceiling
which formed a narrow vertical tunnel with
jagged sides which would afford plenty of
footholds ken supported the older man or
his shoulders and bridger clambered up
and wormed his way above jimmy followed
and lying fiat on a narrow ledge hauled
ken after him and the trio negotiated the
tunnel without difficulty emerging into the
open air

  ahead they could hear the gurgling and
bubbling of the molten lake and soon there
appeared the mists and the occasional pil-
lar of flame from the inferno and finally
that strip of rock leading into the valley

   but as they approached the strip a great
 scaly head appeared from out of the mist
 and a single eye glared hatefully bridgers
 atoblaster blazed and the monster uttered
 a roar as it rose high in the air and crashed
 down a black heaving scaly mass

  killed that one muttered bridger
 right in the eye but the next moment
 his satisfaction gave place to alarm as
 answering bellows echoed from the valley
 and a score of the lumbering brutes rushed
 towards the little strip back he yelled
 well have to get back to the cave -

jimmy who had been in the rear now
led the way up the slope but before
he had taken a dozen steps he halted abrupt-
ly and turned a white face to ken im-
mediately behind him theres some ahead
of us too he gulped

 ken stared aghast and saw several of
 ill innn-jters coming towards them from

 siher side apparently they had been feed-
 ing and were now answering the summons
 jftheir kind we cant go back he said
 grimly and we cant go forward well
 have to go this way he ran along the
 sloping ground crashing through the vege-
 tation and keeping a course parallel with
 the lake but the monsters above were
 lumbering after them and gradually forcing
 them nearer and nearer to the lethal white
 hot lava and when they had passed the
 main lake and running beside the molten
 river the dragon-like creatures had con-
 verged on them from all sides

   already bridger was coughing painfully
 as the sulphurous fumes caught at his
 throat and by common consent the three
 men stopped a few yards from the brink
 of the red gurgling stream

   cant go any closer to it gasped the
 director well have to make a stand here

pay i
   look groaned jimmy pointing across
 the lava stream our craft and un-
 guarded

ken groaned there not fifty yards
away were the two spacecruisers but
for all the practical use they were then
they may as well have been on another
planet if only there was some way of
oettina across the lava he mentally meas-
ured the distance-ten to twelve feet ii
the worst came if they couldn t hold these
brutes off with the atoblaster    but no

 it was impossible to attempt that leap over
 a stream of water yes but unless he
 cleared the bank  if his foot slipped  
 he shuddered and wrenched his mind lrom
 the horrible consequences

   beside him bridger was standing motion-
 less his atoblaster levelled as the monsters
 began moving warily in red eyes gleaming
 threateningly suddenly-jimmy gave a yell
 look out behind us

   bridger turned as one of the monsters
 which had moved down to the brink of the
 lava river began lumbering towards them
 the atoblaster released a bolt of white-hot
 flame and the brute struck in the thigh
 lurched sideways attempted to regain its
 balance and plunged into the river of
 molten lava sending up great red blobs of

   ken stood staring in horror as the great
 beast wallowed in the red depths protected
 by its almost impenetrable heat-resisting
 bide but dying in agony as the lava poured
 into its eye sockets and its screaming mouth
 and then as its dying struggles stilled the

 the atoblaster im going to take a chance
 -rrjhat it was jimmy who turned a

 ws

   startled face to his friend as bridger

 again fired his weapon 	

  ken pointed to the gleaming scaly back
  of the monster now drifting slowly along
  the red river im going to try to get
  across using that if i do ill bring tne

  craft back for you

  you cant yelled jimmy

  look out ken gritted his teeth ran

 downstream waited until	

  abreast and launched himselfforward his
  left foot struck the scaly back of the dead
  monster for a second his heart almost stop-

 ped beating as his foot skidded on the hard
 surface he felt himself losing his balance
 falling forward into the molten mass and
 as his right foot came down instead of at-
 tempting to regain his balance he doubled
 his legs under him and leapt crookedly
 for the bank and a moment later he was
 sprawling on the hot ground

   he clambered to his feet and raced to-
 wards the spacecruiser but before he
 reached it he realised his error in believing
 the two craft to be unguarded a huge figure
 loomed up in front of him as he flung him-
 self at the air lock he had a momentary
 vision of the monster as it reared up and
 stretched out its mass of clawing horny
 fingers felt the agony of ripped flesh as
 his shoulder and back were scored by those
 fearsome claws kicked out desperately as he
 clambered into the machine and as the
 beast fell back momentarily he was insiae
 the air lock closed behind him

   he lav panting on the floor of the craf
 for a moment blood oozing from his
 wounded shoulder then he rose staggered
 over to the controls and the craft began
 slowly to rise through the glastie screen
 in the floor he watched tensely at the drama
 beneath old bridger blasting furiously at
 the monsters keeping them at bay jimmy
 briscoe his white face looking upwards

   ken set the controls and the craft again
 began to descend now directly oyer the two
 hard-pressed men he opened the airlock
 veiled to jimmv and threw down one o
 their atoblasters after which he leaned
 from the airlock and began blazing away

   the triple attack was too much for the
 monsters bewildered and bellowing they re-
 peated into the foliage leaving more than
 a dozen of their number writhing in agony
 from gaping burning wounds and a few
 moments later the craft having picked up
 the two men was soaring up from the valley
 of fire

 higher and higher it rose until the fiery
 planetoid was no more than a misty
 nebulous blur dwindling away in the vast-
 ness of space as the spacecruiser freed itself

from gravity		 

   earth queried jimmy with a crookea

 gj earth echoed the other two with
 sighs of relief good old earth

  it was such a simple crime that only a brain from a bygone age
  could have conceived this

method for murder

in the day of investigator marn an inves-
tigator needed the full range of science
at his finger-tips and when we know that
his was remote in the future beyond the
age of rocketry and space-travel we know
that an investigator was among the brightest
of the men on earth in his day we know
that thought-travel was the simple mode of
transportation over great distances and that
the scientific brains of the era were busy
with problems of thought emergence as
manifested in certain strange cases where
thought of the right place failed to deliver
the subject to his correct destination

  but we know too that through the eons
of time one thing had changed little and
that thing was mans basic emotional struc-
ture hatred greed loveand disappoint-
ment still drove men to crime detection
was a science most highly developd for life
was valued on earth now it was known
from the reports of the space trekers that
no life existed anywhere in the attainable
universe except upon earth

  so when marn was called by thought-
signal to the scene of the murder he was
equipped with more than a usual amount of
knowledge and with much scientific research

by otto kensch

equipment behind him but when he ex-
amined the body he stood up from where
it lay in the alley behind the low-class
dwellings and his face was grim

  the victims skull had been shattered by
a blunt instrument wielded marn supposed
from behind the victim as he walked along
the alley investigation soon revealed cer-
tain facts about the man

  his name was amport flore by occupa-
tion he was a scholar-more exactly he was
a historian of the first atomic era he was
not mated though rumor suggested that he
would soon apply for permission to marry
sasha arkon a flowing bunch of blonde
curves and honey sweetness who worked
in the library of his research establishment
the addar historical library

  from the shape of the fracture in the
skull and depth of the concussion the
particular position of the wound and also
the actual angle at which the body lay
across the street marn was able to deter-
mine that the blow had been a harsh one
probably from a heavy man and from

page 
 the position it was deduced that the man
 for it was most certainly a man was tall

 realising that he would learn ex-
 tremely little from any scientific report
 marn decided to attack the crime from the
 place of employment ol the dead man a
 certain distaste possessed him as he thought
 over the crime never in his expenence
 had he come upon a crime whose blatan
 simplicity had made it involved to a point
 where solution would be as much a matter
 of chance as of science

    a man presumably tall and heavy had
 thought-travelled to this alley at the exact
 time he knew his victim would be passn
 through and having materialised behind
 florehe had smashed his murder weapon
 into his skull and then transferred himsell
 back to his original starting point

    at the librarv marn first sought out the
 the airl sasha arkon who proved to be even
 more alluring than marn had been given to

  you knew amport flore he asked

 yknew him she admitted failing
 to see the trap he had set for her

    you sav you know him he pursued

 htassisted him in his work she purred
 lingeringly im a librarian here

    you didnt contemplate mating with
 him he fired the question suddenly but
 the girl laughed with genuine scorn

 with him mars and venus no she
 jerked out savagely anyone but hmj-
 why do you deal with him in tha

voice marn snapped	

    because  hate him she bit out throu-h

 heeefvou assisted him in his work he

                    do she replied coldly
 and marn smiled as he noted how well the
 new training schemes fitted worker for
  star iota and they earned hem

 out despite all else

    -with whom do you intend to	mate

 he snapped then suddenly sh	flushed

    prettily and raised butterfly eyes	at him

    cwhy do you ask she pred sweetly

    because amport flore was klled this
    afternoon he snapped murdered

 no doubt you will reconstruct the rea-
 soning of the crime and detect the only
 possible culprit she purred

 how do you know of our methods he

 demanded

 kodo and flore talked endlessly ot
 them she replied slowly it is not diffi-
 cult to learn much when one must work
 with historians those two worked together
 in the first atomic era

 where is this kodo now queried marn

  you wish to see him she asked

 when he nodded she crossed to a drawer
 and produced an image of the room ot
 kodos home and she nodded toward it

 this will get us there she smiled
 alluringly

 before the investigator could object to
 her company she was gone and he fol-
 lowed through the standard thought-travel

technique	  

     they were standing side by side in kodo s
  apartment and he rose to welcome them
  with a slow smile that could have been
  either annoyance or fear     
  to what do  owe this visit he asked
  quietly when sasha had introduced them

    marn eyed the man quietly for a time
 before hespoke and noted that he was a
 small fierce man with cold harsh eyes and
 dark aquiline features his hands were

 small and knuckly	

   you worked with amport flore
 queried the investigator quietly

   - do replied kodo just as quietly we
  do researches into the first atomic era

  it is most interesting of late we have read
  much in the crime records one investi-
  gator who would interest you is a man they
  called sherlock holmes it seems he was
  of the police of that time there was much
  crime in that part of the era

    marn made a note to check these state-
 ments for they might prove of value and
 then he switched his tack immediately

     amport flore complains that you threat-
 ened him for paying attentions to sasha
 arkon here snapped marn in a deliberate
 lie

    but kodo blinked back at him coldly
 without a sensation of any emotion on his
 face and then shook his head quietly

     if he says so then he lies was his reply

page 
method for murder

   he was murdered just after five this
afternoon added marn then bludgeoned
to death in an alley on his way home from
his work at the library

   oh im sorry kodo replied softly 
suppose then that you should know that
flore and leist markor had quarrelled to-
day

  whos this markor demanded marn
quietly

   hes the director of the library sasha
told the investigator they  they
quarrelled because  ate lunch with flore

   but why if you hate him he demanded
of her

   we worked much alone it was a bar-
gain she said slowly

  take me to this markor he com-
manded then

thirst they returned to the library and
there sasha produced the necessarv
image for them to travel to markors home
they found him relaxing on a sweeping
lounge and he rose and smiled eagerly as
he welcomed the girl and then turned to
marn

  what can  do for you he asked
quietly

   what were you doing ai five-five this
afternoon he demanded quietly

  why demanded the director of the
library nervously

   simply for the reason that  ask you
snapped marn the harsh official edge hard-
ening his tone

   i was with sasha the man replied sul-
lenly

   that is true the girl nodded we
were differing on a private matter

  what private matter snapped marn
quietly

   a matter of why she would not apply
to be my mate put in leist markor coldly
it is no secret that that is my wish

   then perhaps youll explain why you
killed flore marn flashed suddenly at
the man

   but markor stepped back a pace or two
looked startled and then stammered out a
denial that seemed so sincere that marn was
puzzled and he excused himself without
asking any further question by thought-
travel he was at his office the next instant

and sat down to go through the further
clues produced by his assistants

  the weapon had been found a metal
hall laced to a pliable handle and immedi-
ately marn saw that now that this weapon
was produced it was not possible to be sure
of the height or weight of the culprit for he
was quite capable of being either short or
tall heavy or light depending on just which
way lie handled the weapon

all attempts to trace the origin of the
weapon had so far failed and the fur-
ther clues did nothing more than to make
marn fairly certain where the blonde hair
had come from

   kr the rest the assistants had failed to
unearth any other enemy flore might have
and nothing from his past record or his
personal life outside the library revealed
any possible clues this marn was con-
fident narrowed the crime suspects down
to just three people sasha arkon leist
markor or zorich kodo

   of these he placed the girl as the mo-
tive and so was inclined to rule her out as
a suspect but when he examined the
blonde hairs taken from the lapel of flores
coat and checked them with those of the
girl he was not so sure

   but when he arrived at the library hs
asked sasha to show him manuscripts of
the period in which the men had been re-
searching and for some hours he flicked
through the primitive texts and finally had
his interest caught by a volume headed
method for murder

   as he read he realised that the primitive
writer of the first atomic era was suggest-
ing that simplicity was the key-note of suc-
cessful murder slowly he read through the
pases carefully until he reached a passage
which arrested his attention completely

page 
thrills incorporated

 successful murder methods must above
 all things be simple he read slowly any
 complication that cannot be avoided is a
 danger which the would-be murderer should
 reckon as a possible flaw in the armour 

his case	

 every murder that reduces itselt to one
 or two disjointed clues will be extremely
 difficult of detection for there is little ot
 no possibility for the detective to build any
 semblance of a framework around them
 upon which to hang a reconstructed crime
 the murderer of brilliant mind will choose
 the simple method such an ideal way of
 homicide is a sudden blow to the head when
 the victim is unaware of the murderers in-
 tent and preferably at some spot which is
 remote from the place where the victim
 and murderer normally meet a crime ot
 this sort is the most difficult of solution

slowly marn closed the book and

  stood up all his thoughts were now

 focused on what he had just read and he

 moved into the office where he found sasha

 working quietly

   does markor read m the era with his

 researchers he asked quietly

    she shook her head slowly no he sees
 only their final report

    and in their many discussions of crime
 in the first atomic era was markor ever
 present with kodo and flore 

   no she replied once more markor
 didnt mix with his inferiors he is hated

 fiand marn smiled for he chose not to
 follow up that remark then but went im-
 mediately to the office of the dirfctr 
 entered after the politenesses had been

 spoken marn asked quietly	f
   who would fill your position here if ou

 were on longer in the job

    markor gasped at him in surprise for a
 moment and then replied	 

   now that flore is gone-kodo he is

a brilliant mind	nwtnr 

   then kodo will be the new director

 marn said softly im arresting you for
 the murder of amport flore

   the tall man stepped back a cuple
 paces and then he stopped his shoulders
 drooped and he smiled a sickly grin as he

 cairucause no trouble he told marn
   quietly

   page is

 please marn interrupted softly mov-
 ing in very close say nothing more for the
 moment resist my efforts it must appear
 that  am certain you are the killer

 for a moment markor looked surprised
 and then he began to play the role requested
 so that when lie was finally dragged from
 the library building many of his einployees
 were there to gloat at his discomfiture kodo
 stood and watched with a face devoid of
 expression

    when marn had his man well away from
 the building he turned to him and apolo-
 gised

 that evening marn presented himself at
 the home of sasha arkon and was sur-
 prised at the lavishness of the appoint-
 ments in the rooms and with the very latest
 models in video-graphs and health equip-
 ment he looked around with a calculating
 eye and smiled as he turned back to face
 the girl she was looking nervous and he
 winked at the appointments and raised an
 evebrow suggestively

 	i cant help it she blurted out anxi-
 ouslv men wont listen when  tell them
  do not want these things they giveme
 oifts all the time thev try to buy me

  -who in particular he asked quietly

    but to this she shrugged her shoulders

and laughed	

    it would be of no interest to you she
 replied quietly her voice purring sweetly
 there have been many but none to my

likins	 	

    well enough he replied softly but
 ive come on another matter you must
 know that ive arrested markor and that
 now kodo will become director of the
 addar historical library	

    so she put in as the man paused tor

a moment	 

    i am asking you to co-operate with me

 he began again

    and if i dont she demanded belliger-

entlv	 c 

    then you too may be in the unfortuate
 position of being under guard also he told
 her slowly you forget that you vouch
 for the fact that you were with markor at
 the time of the murder

    the girl flushed at this and he knew that
 she hadlied to him about that point

    what is it you want she asked softly
 after a moment
method for murder

    want you to play your charms to the
 new director of the library he snapped
 suddenly  want it done to-morrow

   for a long time it seemed that the girl
 was about to refuse the request but then
 her mood seemed to change and she
 laughed

   i will join in this foolish plan she said
 providing that  am protected while  do
 this

   i will be there mam told the girl im-
 mediately

   then leave me be till to-morrow she
 snapped at him tartly

   morning broke over the city with a clear
 brilliance and investigator mam had him-
 self transported to the library building be-
 fore the workers arrived and once there he
 hid himself behind the curtains which hung
 in the directors office where the windows
 looked out over the gardens

   time slipped by slowly and he waited for
 some period after working hours com-
 menced before he was rewarded with the
 appearance of kodo the small cold-eyed
 man settled to his labors quickly and seemed
 well conversant with all that was required
 of him but impatience began to get the
 better of marn as he waited for the appear-
 ance of the girl

   at last she came and she was dressed
 as he had never thought to see a female
 adorned the simplicity of the outfit was
 such that it lent to the one jewel a small
 brooch used as a shoulder clasp an aura
 of intrigue and allure for the first time
 marn was fully aware of the subtle appeals
 exercised by this woman and he watched
 as she moved slowly from the door toward
 the desk

   kodo looked up and his eyes gleamed as
 he rose to welcome sasha she smiled be-
 witchingly at him and he reached a hand to-
 ward her almost immediately she had
 flicked herself from his reach and was taunt-
 ing him with her swelling curves

   you are more than man can stand he
 grated angrily there is a way with such
 as you a good way

   sasha glanced around quickly and kodo
 laughed

 	we are alone he assured her calmly
 sasha-alone with the new director of
 the addar historical library that is as
 it should be he added gloatingly

   perhaps she smiled sweetly but per-
 haps a woman wants a man-not just the
 director of a library a man who is cold
 when he must be-easer when he needs to
 be

    am such a one he ripped out at her
 suddenly and then his cold eyes clouded
 and his harsh mask fitted over his face

  how do  know this demanded the
girl

   because i wanted this position he
 growled out and now it is mine

   that was the mere working of chance
 she scoffed at him

phance he barked angrily chance
 that  planned so simply that both men
i hated were removed and i left to fill the
position i desired

   but markor killed flore the girl
 vamped the man

   never snarled the little partly bald
 fellow it was done even as i have read
 of such crimes from the first atomic era
 none saw the emotions that were buried
 deep in me all saw those that flared when
  fought flore off against markor markor
 quarrelled with flore and flore is dead
 naturally it is markor who has killed him
 all this is logical such simplicity is of
 my genius but it was i who killed 
 alone

   with a triumphant leap he dived to seize
 the girl but as she screamed marn came
 from his hiding place and kodo whirled
 on him with savage eyes glaring hate marn
 stood quite still

   i knew perhaps because you boasted of
 certain manuscripts i should read he ex-
 plained and  knew too because such
 simplicity of action and thought does not
 belong to this age but to the dead past
 only you were in a position to attain such
 ways of thinking and planning

   youll never get me kodo snarled
 viciously and was suddenly no longer there
 as he flashed himself away in a thought-
 travel journey

  which place would he know best of
all demanded marn quickly the first
place he would image apart from his own
home

   my apartments sasha replied weakly
 i couldnt stand him after many monthsso

pag 
thrills incorporated

 i sent him away he never forgave me he
 hated flore because  made much ot him

  all this burst from he girl in a sudden
 space of words and marn siood staring tt
 her for a moment and then he asked

  why did you speak badly of florfc he
 asked quietly

  i feared that it might be thought that i
 had killed for my own reasons if you thought
 us more than library workers i  

  where were you when flore was killed
 he snapped suddenly

  -with him in the alley she croaked
 my head was on his shoulder when the

 blow struck

  this explained much and marn realised
 the hopelessness of untangling the webs
 woven of human emotions without the tool
 he had used-that of deliberately working
 on the suspects emotions in a given way
 and watching for untrue reactions

 capture alone now was the problem
 still unsolved he had never been an
 investigator to carry an ato-sonic gun and
 he didnt choose to use one now he had
 a peculiar liking for turning his captives in
 filivc

    following the lead offered by sasha he
 thought-travelled to her apartment and
 materialised outside her front door soulj
 he crept to the front window and peered
 through the pane he could see kodo
 hastily making preparations for a long
 flightand he slipped along to the window
 opening into the next room and let him-
 self in quietly through it once inside he
 moved cautiously and carefully clicked on
 the apparatus which alone could ensure
 privacy against thought-travellcrs who could
 otherwise materialise within the apartment

    once the equipment was in operation the
  apartment was securely sealed against
  thought-travel either from within or with-
  out and marn moved toward the door into
  cte spacious living room in which kodo was
  busily making his preparations

    mam paused at the door for a moment
  and checked a faint frown crossed his face
  as he saw that kodo was armed with a
  deadly ato-sonic gun one blast from that
  and his life would be snapped from him o
  mam decided to wait his chance

    kodos preparations were all complete
  before he set himself an image to thrust

himself forth in thought-travel but he sud-
denly materialised again hard up against the
wall where the equipment formed its bar-
rier with an angry gesture kodo moved
across the room to release the guard switch

   at the door he suddenly was confronted
with marn who leapt from cover and dived
for the man kodos hand flashed down tor
his gun but marn was quick enough and a
fist struck the wrist aside before the hand
could close over the butt of the deadly
weapon

  youre trapped kodo mam snapped
as he swung up a savage right to thesmall
mans chin give up now or it  be the
worse for you

   but kodos answer was to laugh and sud-
denly vanish from in front of the investiga-
tor marn swung round sharply but he
could not sight the man in the room he
was certain that he could not have escaped
beyond and knew therefore that he had to be
in the other room for thought-travel was in-
stantaneous and an immediate appearance
elsewhere was essential there was no pos-
sible way that could be avoided

   so marn plunged into the next room with
a sudden hurtling movement that flung him
spreadeagling on to the floor as the ato-
mic gun blasted over his sprawled form
before the reckless killer could come round
to fire again marn was kicking from the
floor and the deadly gun was flying from
the mans hand and slithering into a tar
corner of the room

   but kodo was not done fighting before
 the investigator could get to his feet he
 clubbed down with both hands and con-
 nected with maras head marn slipped
 back to the floor but was coming up again
 immediately and as he straightened up his
 fists came up one after another in jarring
 blows that rocked the consciousness trom
 tlir little killer

   guarded in a thought-travel bracelet
 which prevented the wearer from travelling
 in this way kodo was taken to the head-
 quarters where his trial was swift and his
 penalty as certain kodo was set mto a
 time cycle from which he could never
 escape he would be whirling through time
 endlessly beyond his natural span of exist-
 ence where to kodo it would seem as a
 moment that would never end

 our horror-filled cover story

screaming in terror he
hurtled to his death rather
than face the doom of his
own invention-the doom

the escaped essence

one last great secret in nature still lay
hidden from the eyes of men the
secret of life itself all over the earth men
of genius worked on that fundamental pro-
blem which had escaped the probing re-
searches of wise men through countless
ages in his mountain-top laboratory
andrew smith was such a scientist

  short by average standards he stood
more than six feet five inches tall with a
great bald head and a face that was guiltless
of hair as he stooped over his apparatus
it was easy to see that he was nervous the
great muscles at his shoulders were tensed
and his eyes were narrowed to thin slits as
he adjusted a complicated system of retorts
and burettes to one of the retorts which
as yet was completely empty he was ner-
vously fixing several leads which led away
to a circuit made up loosely on the floor
in one comer when this was done he
walked to the observation look-out and
watched as his assistant and his two ser-

vants climbcd into the air-craft that stood
waiting there by the hangar

  rocket jets roared into life and a few
seconds more and the wingless crafty had
vanished from his sight with a satisfied
grin he turned back to the benches where
his apparatus was set up

  no sense trusting those fools he mut-
tered to himself theres never been a
chance since the first clumsy equations on
relativity were discovered such a funda-
mental step comes only once the rest is
mere following but for me    he
paused the mere thought of what this
could mean left him awed by the very
genius he was exhibiting in these completely
radical experiments life the very essence
of being was waiting to be discovered

  he could feel the tense atmosphere in
his laboratory his years of work were all
reaching outtowards this one great expert-
ment this was the time the chance the

pag s
thrills incorporated

hope success now meant complete triumph
faijure meant complete defeat either way
smith knew that this was the culmination
of his scientific career

  its got to work he began muttering
to himself ive checked and rccheckcd
every calculation theres not a single ap-
proximation in error by more than one in
ten million every possibility had been
allowed for nothing to chance every-
thing as it should be

  all this he was mumbling worriedly to
himself as he worked over the equipment
which stood waiting to be put into action
but having checked it all for the tenth time
he decided to chcck once more this was
the thoroughness that had won him his high
place in the scientific world of his day

  then fingers nervously twitching lie
reached out and tipped a retort so that the
thin violet liquid flowed slowly to mix with
a colorless fluid in a second retort when
this process was under way he turned to
the electronic circuit and turned a power
switch from the atomic pile deep under
his laboratory power flowed through the cir-
cuit and to those leads on the empty retort
where a strange and violent series of flashes
brought a smile to smiths lips

  this activity mysteriously produced fur-
ther activity in other portions of the appar-
atus until the whole bench of equipment
seemed caught up in the over-all plan which
was smiths experiment as he watched he
kept his eyes riveted on the timing device
fixed in the power line to his circuit and
within one thousandth of a second from the
accurate time of  minutes the mech-
anism cut the power and the empty retort
was suddenly quiet and clear but else-
where the whole equipment was now ex-
cited to very more violent life as the
simmering swirling fluids changed solor and
density as they flowed through a pattern of
tubing toward the empty retort

smiths breath came abruptly and
jerkily in gasping sounds when sheer
necessity seemed to force even this activity
upon him all his attention was concen-
trated on that one retort slowly as the
fluids converged on that one retort they
faded in color and density until he- could
nolonger sec them and it seemed that the
experiment was over a failure

  the mans shoulders drooped dismally
and he turned away and as he did so he
caught sight of the seemingly empty retort
from the corner of his eye and he swung
back in a sudden violent movement

  he had seen something in that retort he
was certain of it but now when he stared
directly at the vessel he could see nothing
desperately he pressed a button which
closed the shutters and brought the labora-
tory to darkness then there in the seem-
ingly empty retort he could see the swirling
greenish vapor that was almost non-existent
to the eye cxccpt that it was faintly glowing
in the darkness

  what instinct had compelled him to shut
the light from the room he could not tell
but now he stood still and watched from
unliving elements he had conjured up this
swirling centre of life the essence of life
itself the very thing that made all nature
pivot around man man-life developed to
its greatest peak of controlled intelligence
man dependent on life and the victim of
death

  but smith chucklcd softly to himself
that was in the past here was the secret
revealed that one fundamental piece of
knowledge nature had kept hidden so long
he andrew smith had laid it bare for all
science to know never again would society
worry over the declining fertility of men and
preach the coming doom of all humans upon
earth here was life itself

  from there great teams of workers would
he able to learn to control and manipulate
the essence so that it moulded and formed
in ways most suitable to the needs of man
once more many children would run and
play through the flower-bordered gardens of
the schools child-starved parents would
once more find their instincts satisfied and
a medium for their love through their
children

  the doom which nature had been thrust-
ing on man through the inevitable march of
evolution would be swept aside the last
dor was open-the seventh veil of nature
was lifted and he andrew smith was the
man he laughed with hysterical abandon
as- he released all the pent up tension that
had gathered over the years

the escaped essence

  succcss made him slightly giddy and a
moist palm went to his egg-like skull and
caressed there damply his eyes were moist
and but half-seeing or he might have seen
sooner might even have stopped the thin
but certainly he would have escaped
reached the hangar and roared to the safety
ol the air in his air-craft

but triumph made a weak man of an-
drew smith and so he leaned back
against the wall and peered through moist
eves at the swirling pale vapor which was
his creation-his masterpiece the essence
of life itself

   for minutes he stood like that till he
straightened wiped the back of a hairless
hand across his eyes and moved forward
to press the button which would flood the
laboratory with light in the sudden glare
he lost sight of the essence and then with a
tremendous effort of will he sat himself
down to record the final stages of his
achievement everything had to be in order
before he presented his log-book to the
academy of science for their approval

   with that deliberate concentration that
was a crucial part of the man the genius
of science smith wrote out the final report
in the cryptic code which was the internat-
ional language of the scientific world since
the great havoc when the old moon plunged
into the earth to be replaced in its orbit
by another there had been peace and
friendship among all peoples but this old
code had survived as a curious reminder of
the time when war and threatened war had
held men in fear over all the earth

   suddenly smith stopped jerked upright
and shifted his foot as he looked down to-
ward it a sense of horror crept through
him as he stared at the boot which was
partially eaten away and the thing that
had been his foot blood should have
flowed but it trickled and gushed forth and
seemed to vanish without leaving stain or
blemish on the highly polished floor he
felt no pain

  with terror making every move a jerky
pause smith got to the button and once
more plunged the laboratory into darkness
all around him he could see the essence in
its vaporish greenness as it slowly enveloped
and consumed the objects around it he
whirled for the door made a violent effort

to reach it but saw that his creation had
already beaten him there and that he was
trapped

  trembling he moved toward the bench
where he had worked and flashed a light
on the apparatus the retort in which he
had collected his essence was no longer
there-just a fragment remained held in the
the clamp of the stand

   good god he gasped aloud i forgot
life consumes in order to live dog eat
doc where do  remember that from i
wonder all that care and i neglect a fun-
damental

e shook his head in bafflement it
would be wrong to say that he was not
afraid but over all his fear now that he
knew he could not cscape was the driving
curiosity which had made a scientist of
andrew smith then a sudden though
occurrcd to him the world they had to
know had to know of his success

   hurriedly he flashed the laboratory into
brilliant light again and then prepared the
tiny rockef niilajet furiously he scribblcd
the last notes in his log and then loaded
it into the chamber of the small millaiet
still he felt no pain as the green death fed
from his foot and his boot seeming con-
tent to leave his other leg completely alone

   rushing over to the tube he set the milla-
jet in position and fired the mechanism
nothing but a slow hiss answered his efforts
his face clouded and he slowly sank back
into his chair and closed the shutters all
around he could see the greenish essence
sending out feelers of itself as it investigated
its surroundings the machamsm of the
millaiet was wrapped in one of these an-
other still twisted about smiths leg and he
stared in fascination as his life was being

drawn from him

   sheer amazement that le could feel no
pain was the essential emotion as he sat
there but slowly as he saw by what slow
degrees the thing grew and consumed an-
drew smith became afraid fear crept
through him like a faint breath of comet-
dust drifted through space slowly the cold
hand of fear reached out and caught at his
guts and he screamed suddenly horribly
as he peered down at his corroded foot

  leaping up on his one good foot he
slapped the button which swung open the

page it
thrills incorporated

 shutters and then he snatched up a retort
 from the bench and hurled it deliberately at
 the transparent windows the metal retort
 crashed through with a shattering splinter
 of glass and then one after another smith
 hurled the retorts through till there was no
 glass in one whole section of the window

  crying out in his terror smith leapt
 through the space and hurtled down the
 depths that took him crashing to his death
 at the foot of the cliff upon the top of which
 his lonely laboratory had been constructed
 useless now a rocket air-craft waited in the

  but down at the bottom of the clifi the
 cscaped essence lived and grew and soon
 there remained no sign of andrew smith

 discoverer ol life noi in the harsh liulit ol
 day was there any sign of that greenish
 vapor which glowed slightly in the dark
 ness

  all through the day it lived and worked
 unseen and when night came the pale green
 tentacles ot the monstrous growth could k
 seen encompassing the mountain itself and
 it seemed that thething was now eating the
 mountain itself

  three days passed and the mountain was
 no longer an inanimate mass of elements
 but the life essence had entered into it and
 devoured it and filled it with life the moun-
 tain was mobile as the pale green tentacle
 reachcd out in further quest they flowed
 out and gradually formed into the shape ol
 the mountain at another spot and then
 moved on again

 tn the night the pale green horror was a
  beacon for miles but though the mon-
 ster of life moved on it it did no further
 damage for it seemed sated the essence
 seemed to have infused all the mass with
 life it was capable of infusing now dull

 unthinking moving under pressure of what
 strange impulse was unknown the thing
 moved towards the populated areas around
 the city

   smith before ordering his assistant from
his wilderness laboratory had promised to
contact him by video telephone within two
days and when no message came through
on his private tuning marx kordar decided
to return to the laboratory once his rocket
craft was airborne he was directed into a
flight lane by the control station and was
soon roaring away westward from the city

   soon he had passed the outer limits of
population and was flying slowly over the
vast areas where the slowly retreating line
of settlement marked the dwindling popu-
lation of thegreat nation depopulation
had set in like a plague and sterility became
more common among men than fertility
and science had failed to find an answer as
the populations of the world shrunk back
and back ever closer to the great centres
of life in the cities

   melancholy feelings always gripped marx
as he flew over the deserted areas and sud-
denly he speeded his craft and headed
directly for smiths laboratory the speed
if his flight carried him there within min-
utes and he cut speed and circled down
slowly surprise then horror came over
him as he saw the smoothly rounded knob
f earth which was all that remained of
the mountain

   venus and mars he ejaculated sud-
denly smith has wiped himself out and
the mountain with him no wonder he
wanted me out of the way

   then lie dipped his craft down in a
steep spin and landed the ship in a perfect
poise landing once outside he investigated
and could find no possible explanation ol
the strange smoothness of what was left of
the mountain nor of certain evidences that
other well-known landmarks had been
destroyed in a seemingly senseless pattern

   he could think of no precedent of any
tvpe of destructive activity which could
account for the phenomena he witnessed
then stoopinu from his seven feet four of
height he collected samples of earth and
mapped the pattern of the devastation in
order thpl he might be able to make a com-

the escaped essence

plete report when he returned to the
academy of science

   for hours he wandered around testing
and trying to prove one working hypothesis
after another finally as it approached
darkness he climbed back into his rocket
craft and soared up into the higher altitudes
in a dizzy spiral which he somehow hoped
might shake the wonderment from him and
leave him with a concrete sense of the key
to the mystery

   but two hours of circling down over the
fateful spot failed to tell him anything more
and he completed his eye-witness report
and tabulated his collected samples then
taking over from his robot pilot he set
course back towards the city he flew
slowly and at less than five thousand feet
for he was shocked by the days revelations
and somehow distrusted the pace of the
upper atmosphere

below him and ahead he caught sight
of the greenish thing saw the long
tcntacles flowing out and then swelling as
the lifc-thing moved toward the distant city
and the populated areas cuttina his speed
till he had just sufficient to remain airborne
he circled an dobserved and used his night-
photographv equipment to making moving
rccords of the scenc

   at three or four places as he moved back
towards the old site of the laboratory marx
found evidence of further devastation simi-
lar to that seen earlier and between these
points the country was iust as if the lifc-
thing had never crossed it of all he saw he
made careful note and thqn hastened back
to the academy of science where he sought
and obtained immediate audience with the
chief

   sleepily the chief of the academy came
into the consulting rooms and sat wearily
in a revivifying chair which he turned on
with an automatic gesture as the chair
hummed into the life which revived flagged
nerves and tired brains the chief brightened
and sat erect

   well kordar he said softly as he
turned the chair mechanism off what is
so important that you should demand an
audience at this time of night has smith
been up to something outside the code laid
down by the academy

    cant tell chief stammered kordar
addressing the chiel directly and in person
lor the first time in his life its difficult to
know    well you see---- he flound-
ered hopelessly

  suppose you start at the beginning
thats usual snapped the chief sarcastic-
ally

   ive reported previously to the academy
on the work carried out by smith marx
kordar began quietly more sure of himself
now you are aware im sure of the
completely radical  might almost say
blasphemous line of research smith was
following of late he has worked much
alone and  know little of what he has done
since my last report to the academy five
days aso he shipped me and the two ser-
vants out from the mountain he said he
would contact me within two days i waited
-nothing happened

   get to the point man barked the chief
irritably

   a quick thought flashed through kordars
brain that this fellow ought to have taken
a few minutes longer in the chair treatment
but he made no comment

   when he failed to contact me i tried to
fish him he failed to reply and i took my
rocket air-craft and investigated he
paused for a moment as he handed across
his report here arc my complete findings

 have already turned my samples over to
the analytical department for reports

   the chief took the report without a word
he was used to efficiency and couldnt tol-
erate any lack of it and so he saw nothing
complimentary in kordars promptness of
action his eyes narrow and deepset under
hairless brows flashed over the coded report
in a lightning perusal which told him all the
salient features of the case when he looked
up again his eyes were wide and his lips
hung apart a little

  ive thought much on your reports on
smith he growled slowly the conclus-
ion  arrived at recently that his radical
approach to the problem of life was the
only one at present being investigated that
seemed ever likely to reveal a single use-
ful fact now im certain that smith has
discovered that which wed all sought for
generations the life cssence

he broke off suddenly and snapped a
switch and then rasped into a seem-
ingly solid piece of synthetic material

  have science four air group alerted
immediately take-off time is plus twenty-
five minutes check

  the message was repeated through that
same seemingly solid picce of material
which was glowing with the image of a man
seated at a large control board then the
viewer was cleared and the chief wheeled
round and strode toward the door there
he paused wheeled round swiftly and rap-
ped out

   you will accompany me on this flight
he ordered

  plus twenty-five minutes was gone by
thirty minutes before the science four
group sighted the life-thing for the first time
it was when stationary for brief spaces of
time roughly the shape and size of the
laboratory mountain and once it even
seemed that the laboratory itself could be
distinguished in the shape but it melted and
formed so continuously that none of those
in the group could be certain of that

  as they watched with night-vision
viewers the thing seemed to be feeding and
it enveloped and digested things mainlv jiv-
ing though some noticeable shape differ-
ences remained where it took in certain
rocky outcrops of land

  the chief of the academy watched with
enthralled keenness and when at last he
reluctantly turned away from his viewer he
checked with his men from a synthesis of
their reports it seemed certain to him that
this new life-thing was smiths creation so
he headed his force to the site of the labora-
tory and they swiftly went to work and with-
in two hours sufficient reports had been
turned in by his staff to assure him that this
spot was the origin of the life-form

   if this is a life-form queried kordar
solemnly will it have the capacity of re-
production

  possibly the chief replied thought-
fully but more urgent things concern us
now whether by chance or design this
thing is moving directly towards the popu-
lated regions and the city from observa-
tion weve seen it feeding and showing a

definite preference for live foods this
means our populations are in grave danger
but theres one experiment we can try first
before we spread the warning

   and an hour later this plan was being
tried from the air a force of army craft
were herding a huge mob of wilderness
cattle towards the greenish vaporish thing

   if it develops a hunger for them then it
must be destroyed snapped the chief as
he watched the progress of the drive from
his superior altitude

   and when the great herd of wild cattle
were within two miles of the thing it sud-
denly swept out great flowing tentacles
which formed a huge jaw which closed
around the herd slowly those rolling cattle
melted away into nothingness and the chief
shrunk back from his viewer with a look
of disgust on his face

   order a bomber fleet out he snapped
to the captain of his army squadron total
destruction

   the order was relayed and the science
four group climbed high bearing off
slightly to be beyond the danger zone when
the bomber group zoomed in to attack
less than fifteen minutes and the group
streaked through the sky and dived on the
tareet and loosed their bombs in one tre-
mendous splash of terror the whole night
seemed suddenly strewn with greenish stuff
and the land rocked from the dread power
of the blast

   mission completed came the video-
telephone signal a moment later and the
chief flashed back his all clear with the
reply

   but science group four circled over the
 spot and waited life still pulsed in those
 scattered fragments scattered over the coun-
 tryside in a wide circle and stark horror
 crowded the smooth face of the chief as
 he watched them moving and coagulating
 into larger masses which were in turn mov-
 ing towards the centre of the explosion area
 where a central mass was already formed

   indestructible he growled savagely
 the essence of life itself

 tut the city asked kordar desper-
     ately

   issue a warning for the city to be evacu-
 ated by to-morrow snapped the chief as
 they headed back towards the academy ol
 science

   meanwhile all over the country video
 screens greeted the early risers who tuned
 for the official announcements with the hor-
 rifying spectacle of the thing engulfing the
 great herd of cattle and then of its being
 blasted apart and its reformation follow-
 ing came a map of the likely path of the
 life form and the announcement of the
 evacuation order over and over again the
 message was flashed throughout the country
 till there was no single citizen who had not
 seen and heard all at least a dozen times

   during the day no knowledge could be
 gained of its whereabouts and panic was
 sweeping through the outlying districts
 men went crazy and looting and violence
 ruled through the day husbands feared to
 leave wives and daughters as rape gangs
 ruled the country in some districts until the
 army forces were rushed in even these
 well-trained men found it almost impossible
 to be in all places and the gangs formed
 nd had their way

   thousands clinging to the primitive be-
 liefs of the pre-scientific ages went to their
 knees and uttered ancient rituals the mean-
 ings of which had been lost in the darkness
 of the past desperation followed despera-
 tion as all available craft were diverted to
 evacuate the entire population of the im-
 mediate danger area

   with the coming of night the army rushed
 forces of oxygen-fire groups to make an
 assault on the thing once it had been re-
 vealed bv the darkness these men rode
 the skies in individual craft of the smallest
 size and of great speeds in full force they

 patrolled the area as the shadows lengthened
 down over the earth and with the first faint
 alimmering of green they dived recklessly
 in to the attack

    in tight formation they loosed their bursts
 of fire and a solid sheet of flame flayed
 down over the tentacled horror it con-
 vulsed desperately and then flung its long
 tentacles off over miles of territory in all
 directions but still it lived and moved as
 they swept in again to renew their attack
 again they failed though it was obvious
 that some sort of damage was being done to
 the thine

   the chief of the academy of sciences
 watched from above and he ordered attack
 after attack until the force had completely
 exhausted their charges and had laid waste
 an enormous area of the wilderness then
 with the attacks ceased the chief slowly
 watched the thing reform its shape and
 started forward as he realised that it had
 been reduced in size by almost two thirds

   command more flight of the oxygen-fire
 fleets he ordered

    but by theiime the next flight had arrived
 the greenish vapor had sped swiftly across
 the country to an area unspoiled by the
 blasts and was there enveloping forest and
 animal life in giant pincer movements which
 seemed more virile and active than any pre-
 vious movement

   fires the chance we have he growled
 to kordar angrily but look at that some-
 how weve given the thing vitality even
 though weve reduced its mass it s a
 danaerous weapon to use

   however when the fresh flights of oxy-
 gen-fire crafl swept in the chief command-
 ed an immediate attack and had signals out
 for the diversion of every available oxygen-
 fire craft to the area flight after flight
 swept in through the remaining hours of the
 night but by morning the thing was still
 sweeping across the country and the later
 attacks had far less effect on the monstrous

form	 

   were beaten growled the cluet
 angrily its already building up resistance
 against that form of attack by to-night it
 will be useless

   that day in the city complete chaos
 reianed as every terminal for rocket craft
 was jammed with masses of terror-stricken
 fighting madmen their bald domes in sharp

page n
thrills incorporated

 contrast to the long-haired heads ot the
 women al special  terminals a fleei ol
 craft were detailed to remove all the fertile
 males and females to places considered
 safe a ticket avowing fertility was a sure
 passport to escape

murdered bodies were strewn along
the length of the city as the army
completely failed to keep order and men
and women were bludgeoned to death lor
their fertility passes desolation such as
was not known in history since before the
era of peace was abroad on that day
looting rape murder and every violeni
crime almost unknown in recent history
suddenly flared as the primitive instinct of
self-preservation asserted itselt and tlu
highly intelligent giants of that utopian
world were slaughtered in the mad parties
to escape

   sunset came and night once more the
chief of the academy of science was air-
borne after day-long conferences with the
greatest brains of the era all day they had
puzzled through the many plans tot the
destruction of the monstrous new threat to
their existence and but one suggestion that
seemed to merit trial had been brought for-
ward immediately a decision had been
rcached scientists were set to work to supply
the necessary equipment but this could n
possibly be ready before the folowin ni-ht
despitethe colossal output of the automate
factories

   kordar look the chief growled
angrily

   marx kordar sighted the viewer from
the craft and stared down in fascinated won-
der as he saw the twin greenish splashes ol
vapoury nothingness which answered mat
question which had been posed earlier the
life-thing had reproduced itself down be-
low two identical shapes moved relentlessly
toward the city and now that the thing
had split and reproduced itself it was de-
vouring whatever came within their path
and growing in size as the men above
watched

   it will reach the city already before
morning kordar said in an awed whisper

   less than half of the population will be
evacuated by morning the chief muttered

  page 

worriedly less than halt all forces
seem to be working for the destruction of
man on earth first the great wars then
the havoc when the old moon crashed into
earth as the new moon took up its orbit
then the fertility plague and now this creep-
ing  horror conjured up by smith in his
search for the secret of life

   smith gasped kordar slowly id
forgotten him the    the thing must have
gotten him

   of course snapped the chief as if it
were a matter of little importance order
all forces out with oxygen-fire equipment
lie snapped then

bui despite every effort they made the
greenish death crept into the deserted
villages which surrounded the city when
the first was passed there was no sign of
the dead who had strewn the streets lrom
the mass violence the day before they
had gone into the hungry maws of the life-
thingt vanished not a trace remained of
any living thing in the village or around it

   then along the video telephone flashed
a message that gave a sudden expression of
hope to the chief

   its worth it he laughed worth a
try suggestion from asia i hree has just
come in the suggestion is that wc inflict
a number of virus diseases on the things

   and while the twin monsters flowed on
their way toward the city and the sea be-
yond viruses were being rushed from the
laboratories where they were bred and con-
tainers of these were dropped in the path ot
the greenish hills viruses were life and
they vanished into that enveloping flood ot
greenish vapor

   aloft the chief anxiously awaited the
results of the experiment but dawn inter-
vened and the things were lost from sight
all that day the science four group stayed
in the air and watched the frantic evacua-
tion of the city as the day wore on hope
became greater and the first darkness was
eagerly awaited

   the city was a place of the dead by the
lime the last rocket craft had soared aloft in
the late afternoon and the chief gazed
down with a hatred and disgust that he
could not repress
the escaped essence

   our acadcmy has worked through gen-
 erations upon generations to raise our
 people above the animals from which they
 spring look and he pointed down
 there is stamped the mark of the beast
 like a great blot on our history

   fear rules all things kordar replied
 solemnly voicing his new-learned truth

   fear fear shouted the chief of the
 academy loudly the solution dont
 you see it fear one thing alone we have
 discovered that will send this thing in re-
 treat-fire millions of degrees of heat
 we can tame it and control it with fire
 send it scuttling away if it obeys that in-
 stinct common to all animal life

fresh orders were flashed and every
available craft capable of firing any fire-
missile at the things were assembled and
the chief snapped his orders

   the shots must be fired on the city side
 of the things they must not hit them but
 must be close slow steady fire is called
 for

   then with the darkness fully down and
 the things sighted close upon the city the
 first shots of the new attack were made at
 first the things held their ground and then
 retreated slowly and as the attack gained
 momentum the things were flowing across
 the country back toward the wilderness in
 a desperate rush

   satisfied that this form of attack could
 be maintained the chief hurried back to
 the academy of science and there he made
 some swift preparations they had the
 breathing space they needed to forge fur-
 ther weapons to eventually wipe out this
 menace 

   but it was three days later that science
 four group took off from the city with
 their equipment and headed far out into
 the wilderness where the army craft were
 still keeping the things on the move and
 headed away from settled country

   then the group of craft that carried the
 scientists settled into a formation and
 moved out over the life-things smith had
 created at the order of the chief the appa-
 ratus was set humming and the invisible
 beam of ultra-milli-high frequency rays

 were directed down from aloft the tight
 circle of the beams gradually closed around
 the twin horrors and they shrank into them-
 selves more and more as they were bom-
 barded with the deadly beams

   slowly with the coming of the dawn
 the things became inert and remained still
 but for a small flicker 

   shall we completely extinguish our ob-
 jective crackled the video as the squadron
 leader reported

   kordar looked anxiously at the chief

 we can control it    must it all go for
 nothing   

   i think yes deliberated the chief
 grimly the secret weve sought for gen-
 erations must perish down there and kor-
 dar-your reports to the academy have
 been seen by no one but myself you must
 never mention the line of smiths work or
 anything you know of his experiments you
 understand

   but all those who seek for the sccret of
 life kordar protested wonderingly

   they will continue to seek-vainly
 such a secret is revealed but once in an
 era let it die now with those monsters it
 sired said the chief sombrely life is
 flexible through time it has built up re-
 sistance to the perils that threatened it  
 who knows that this will not finally build
 up an insurmountable resistance to us
 creatures who have created it    and what
 then

   he switched his video screen to send

osland ortford stared out from
the strato-liner circling down over
austral city and grinned at his brother
bris in oslands eyes there was the look
of determination that came into them ai
intervals when things became tough for the
boys who had stuck together for a long
time

   this is it bris he snapped eagerly
heres where well collect some of that
coin which will get us to seeing the other
planets just because we happened to be
bom to a father that didnt give a damn
for anything but fooling with an atomic
motor we dont have to stick with the mob
for the rest of our lives

   im not betting on that authorities are
cctting mighty careful about fellows like us
trying to get above their position in lite
bris growled back somberly

  bris knew how lough life could be in
austral one he had met up with a couple

of stray genes left in his family for a heap
of vears since before they knew what to do
about radiation effects in heredity the re-
sult was that he had two joints in his arms
instead of the normal one

   that made things mighty tough for bris
as he grew up through his first ten years to
maturitv there were plenty of tough offi-
cials who were all for having him classified
as a upper-grade mutant and sending him
to the segregated area of his community to
live but mainly because osland could be
mighty tough when he needed and perhaps
too becausc the ruling classes didn t like
treadinc down the workers too much he had
managed to get by in normal society

   plenty of folks resented him but he got
by together he and ossie had gone
through the three weeks of jet-school train-
ing that equipped them through a care-
fully worked out system of sleep learning
for all that they would need to know to

he wrenched his jet-wheel
down frantically as he saw
bris shoot over the track
into a wild lunge through
the air

bccome production overseers in the factor-
ies turning out atomic jets for the giant
space ships that travelled the normal routes
of trade with the sister planets of earth

   once they were cleared through the in-
spection rooms at the strato-liner field they
caught a street car into  the heart of the
city where they were immediately caught in
the hustle of the crowds pouring along the
street heading in one special direction

   say what goes on here queried ossie
turning to watch the mass of people rushing
by as if they were in the greatest haste to
get to some special spot

   bris took shelter behind his brothers six-
feet-two of brawn and muscle and shook his
dark head somberly he was only five-feet-
six tall and couldnt see much but leastways
he counted that better than being carricd
away into the mad throng that rushed along
the street

   lets get into this pep-drink joint and
maybe we can find out suggested ossie as
he tired of pushing over the mixed crowd of
workers and seggics the segregated work-
ers of the lowest class who were those with
mutant genes caused by the primeval
effects of war before bortkratz successfully
demonstrated that man could be immunised
against the effects of atomic radiation

   inside the joint they walked to the bar
and demanded their drinks pep-drink could
be had in any flavor from martini through
a tremendous range to martian blue which
was the latest craze in austral city

   ossie raised his eyebrows in appreciation
as he sighted the girl who slid the drinks
along to them he preened his tunic care-
fully and grinned at her the dazzling dark
haired head of the girl tossed haughtily as
she saw his short-cut hair which signified he
belonged to the worker-class

   whats the brush-off babe asked
ossie purringly	

  worker she snapped at him what
could you do for me im looking for
something better than you

  whats wrong with me he growled
back angrily im as good as the next one 

   ruler-class men have their own strato-
ships and seggie maids she retorted
slowly

   lets get out of here snapped ossie
suddenly seems like any pep-drink slinger
is figuring a worker too good for her around
here

hold it ossie replied bris quietly
thought we were going to find out what
the mob was doing

   yeah whats the mob asked ossie
 turning back to the five feet five of sizzling
 female behind the bar

    theyre going to the jct-wheel stadium
 down the street she told him coldly
 maybe if you were a jet-jockey you
 wouldnt have to wear your hair short like
 that she added with a taunting grin

    ossie stalked out of the street and turned
 in the wake of the crowd that was now
 thinning his eyes were intent as he fol-
 lowed the last of the crowd which was
 hurrying to the stadium after being released
 froni their factories just after mid-day

   he grinned even in austral outback
 they had heard rumors of unrest in the
 cities seggies and workers had too much
 time on their hands despite the fact that the
 authorities had raised the working hours
 from three to four and then to four and a
 half

    the greatest scientific brains were taxed
 with thinking up new ideas to amuse the

laura watched eagerly as ossie and bris
climbed side by side to the championship

 restless underprivileged ones for the authori-
 ties dared not increase hours and production
 further for already they were faced with
 the situation where there were sufficient
 strato-liners and space-ships to last for the
 next fifty years

   excitement raged as a great team of men
 were set at work on the problem within
 three weeks they had finally decided on an
 extremely ancient past-time called bike
 racing but alas it was soon discovered
 that the form of machine used was so primi-
 tive that even the greatest engineering brain
 in austral one could not understand the
 workings of the motor

   once more research was called for and
 the final design was the jet-wheel it was
 to them an extremely crude mechanism a
 single wheel with an atomic jet motor of
 insignificant size set haif-wav between the
 axle of the wheel and the strange top where
 the jockey was called upon to lav face
 down while he raced his machine against
 the competitors

   and with this craze came stars among the
 jet-jockeys and though the size of each
 separate component was specified by law
 iet-iockevs found ways of bumping up the
 speed of their machines by the extra few
 miles per hour that it required to make
 them champions soon ugly rumors were
 running that jet-wheel races were being
 rigged-	  

   soon too a too-succcssful jet-jockev
 could reckon on a thrashing he wouldn
 forget in a spell of years but the por
 saved the security of austral one and
 allowed it to pursue its war on mercury  in
 peace the authorities were happy

 at the entrances to the stadium ossie
 pulled up and headed for the blue
 cates he glanced down at his blue tunic
 and growled as he paid his entrance and
 passed through through a barricade he
 could see the red-tunicked rulers with their
 long hair sitting in comfortable scats around
 the transparent track where the races com-
 menced and finished

   just look at them he snapped at bris
 smirking from their comfort

   but bris turned an eye to where the ycl-
   low-tunicked seggies crowded together their
   shaven heads bobbing in their endeavor to
   keep sight of the jet-wheels which were

 moving slowly round the track at a hundred
 miles an hour getting set for the commence-
 ment of the first race

   one day ill wear my hair long and wear
 the red ossie snarled

   that takes money bris warned and
 plenty more than the sort of money we re
 ever likely to earn

   ill find a way growled ossie stub-
 bornly were going places kid

   might as well try the number machines
 suggested bris everyone seems to be bet-
 ting on six

   then mine goes on number two ossie
 snapped loudly

   they went across to the numbers mach-
 ines and slid their coins into the slots with
 ossie tipping all he had into the slot num-
 bered two bris figured that the crowd knew
 more about it than he did and bet on six
 to the side of the slots into which- they
 had inserted their coins were other slots
 and from these shot perforated plastic discs
 carrying their numbers

   quickly they pocketed these and hurried
 back to where they could see the track tt
 was new to them the craze hadn t hit
 austral outback yet and they stared in
 curiositv at the transparent track with its two
 ions straights and its four sharp corners
 where the track curved right up to form a
 wall and where the jet-wheels turned from
 each corner the track arched over to form

   damned primitive sort of business
 bris said quietly cant see whats so ex-
 citing about this	

   i been listening to the prizes themboys
 net if thev win put ossie savagely take
 a look aint a one of the hestboystha
 arent wearing their hair long they do all

 rrl hear thev meet a sudden end often
 enough too bris answered quietly it s

 dirty clear through 

   so what snapped ossie disgustedly

 the moneys clean aint it

   bris shrugged his shoulders as the green
 light flashedand the jet-wheels roared away
 to a terrific start with ten men balancing
 skilfully atop their machines as they flung
 them into the first bed

   a great yell went up from the crowd as
   they saw the favorite number six roar his
   machine high up on to the roof of the first
jet-wheei jockey

 bend and sweep down into the second with
 a clear lead over the field the race was
 over twenty-mile laps the record for the
 course stood at  minutes for the twenty
 miles

   this slow speed had been obtained by
 the careful design of the jet-wheels at this
 speed and with the design of balance in
 the jet-wheels the onlookers could follow
 the race and see the skill with which their
 champions won through to the finish

   already two laps of the course had been
 completed and number six was still leading
 the field -with flashing atomic jet blazing
 wild with excitement the crowd of seggies
 were yelling hysterically

   just listen to them seggies yelling
 ossie snapped their money is on number

 xthose other jockeys wont catch him
 cither bris replied matter-of-factly
 something will happen grinned ossie
 someone stands to lose a lot of money it
 number six comes home first

   whats that got to do with it de-
 manded bris quietly

   grow up kid laughed ossie deris-
 ively a red tunicked gent owns this
 stadium-have you ever seen a red tunic
 come off second best

   four laps were gone and number six
still held the lead though he was taking the
corners too fast and his machine was wobb-
ling as it hit the corner leading from the
home straight for the fifth lap

   number two is riding well in second
 place crowed ossie that fool out in
 front will be taking a fall look at his jet-
 wheel getting out of control

   beside ossie a deep voice growled ossie
 turned to look at the big gruff fellow with
 his eyes staring hard at the track as he
 growled angrily at the man at his side

   one more lap and lace had better spill
 off that wheel else well be havin business
 with him

    the little fellow at his side grinned 
 anticipation

   time we had a job to do he purred
 silkily im getting out of practicc

   yeah nodded the big fellow say
    look that fool is stepping on the

pace	 n i 

   it was true number six was flashing

 into the last lap of the gruelling race at
 a reckless speed that was shooting him
 further in advance of his rivals grimly
 number two was trying to stay with him
 then suddenly a hush came over the
 crowd number six had lost control

   the jet-wheel was roaring along the
 roof of the second last bend and heading
 for the edge which would shoot him into
 space fling him far over the heads of
 the seggies to a certain death when he
 crashed to earth

   that wasnt part of it ripped out the
 big fellow

   seggies howled excitedly as the champion
 came again near the finishing line he
 got within a half-wheel of the unpopular
 number two

 lace was after that race snapped the
 big man he was told to lose

   then he whirled and caught sight of
 ossie staring quietly at him his eyes
 closed to mean slits

  this big outback fellow has been
listening he purred to his little partner
we dont like that do we

   nope we dont like that agreed the
 little man

   you want to make some money smart
 asked the big fellow then

   i just did laughed ossie flashing out
 his winning discs on number two

   real money snarled the big gruff
 man thats seggic stuff

   what being a jet-jockey demanded
 ossie sneering

   so drawled the gruff man smart
 boy eh maybe you wouldnt be bad at
 that just the type to please the crowd
 here forget what i said and see this gent
 maybe youll be his type

   then the big fellow wheeled away and
 stalked off toward where a few people were
 collecting coin from the pay-out slots of the
 gambling machines ossie and bris went
 across to them and saw the big man make
 a heavy collect on number two and then he
 himself collected while bris stared in amaze-
 ment at the amount of coin he received for
 his trifling outlay

   thats a nice easy way to make money
 if vou know which jockey is going to finish
 in front bris said softly

pnw w
thrills incorporated

   that big tough knew suggested ossie
 quietly

  what was that card he gave you de-
 manded bris as he recalled the small card
 that had been thrust into the hand of his
 brother by the tough individual who had
 collected so heavily on the win by number
 two

   glancing at the card ossie grinned

  here read it he said as he passed
 it over

   say you been talking about these boys
 this fellow runs a team of riders why
 dont you see him bris asked

  and be told when to win and when to
 lose snorted ossie in disgust as he tuckcd
 the card away with his winnings a few
 more collccts like that one and ill buy my
 own jet-wheel

  but by the time the last race hit the
 track ossie was borrowing a coin from bris
 to back his fancy for the final event

   theyre crooked he was snarling as he
 slipped the coin into number one the slot
 which represented the favorite for the
 event number one came a poor fourth in
 the event

  together they were thrust from the
stadium by the push of the crowd behind
them

  well be needing to start work to-
 morrow ossie snarled angrily as they got
 away from the pushing throng getting
 food-ray in this city costs money and some-
 where to sleep is important

 from the haughty girl in the pep-drink
 joint they learned they could get a room
 upstairs cheaply this they took and then
 went to the nearest food-ray dispenser for
 their quota of food delivered through the
 thin blue hissing tube which provided them
 with all the materials they would need
 for their bodies till the following morning
 only the richest of the red tunics could
 afford to have their own food-ray equip-
 ment all else rayed at the public dis-
 pensers where the rays were sold at two
 gold coins a minute

  morning came and they plodded to the
 nearest factory where alomic-jet motors
 were produced the owner shook his mass

of long hair stubbornly as he refused them

   cant use another man he said sadly
 things are bad production is too high
 this confounded sleep learning is making
 workers too efficient an outrage against
 society got to be stopped soon a seggie
 will be able to do as much as either of you
 if you dont act

   the second night ossie and bris slept
 in seggies town it wasnt comfortable on
 the hard plastic bcnch in the shelter and
 from the cracks in the old shelter crept the
 vermin that made sleep impossible

   dawn came and with it the crackling of
 the vidcograph

   here is the news called the voice
 from the screen austral space scouts last
 night turned back a determined attack by
 a larger force of mcrcurians on mercury
 herself our attacks arc proceeding accord-
 ing to plan an outstanding announcement
 isexpected from headquarters at any mo-
 ment  

   turn it off snarled an angry seggie
 who gives a damn one way or the other
 them red tunics cant think of anything
 but war

   and now     the voice continued
 a local item lace lotard famous jet-
 wheel champion 

   turn that up a voice cried i want
 to hear that

       was found in central park badly
 battered he is now undergoing special
 ray treatment in an attempt to save his life
 no further news on his condition is to hand
 as yet police suspect that he was the vic-
 tim of the gambling racketeers who are be-
 lieved to be winning fortunes at the jet-
 wheel stadiums our programme will be
 interrupted at any time to bring you fur-
 ther news of him

   the voice droned on with other news but
 no one listened now as an excited clamor
 of voices discussed the hot news from the
 jet-wheel world

   lets get outa here snapped ossie
 guess well steal a strato-lincr back to
 austral outback theres still work there

 then he stopped dead in his tracks and
 clutched at the ticket in his pocket slowlv

he drew it out and stared at the name and
address

  ill make that haughty female change
her tune he snarled come on weve
got work to do

  an hour later they had hiked to the ad-
dress noted on the card and in the first
office osland ortford demanded to see silas
kramph and the sultry girl behind the desk
pointed to the door down the long hall
lighted all the way by the glowing walls
the floor was soft and easy under their feet

  this is class grinned ossie as he
looked around approvingly

  there aint anything lower than a mar-
tian mutant if you except the ones thatll
swindle seggies bris muttered why
dont we just head back for austral out-
back

    got a date to flaunt long hair and a red
tunic in the face of that pep-drink slinger
snapped ossie this is where we change
our old mans bungling

  the door ahead of them opened as they
approached and they found themselves in
a room fitted with an arrangement of con-
traptions they couldnt figure out across
from the door they spotted a small round-
faced man snapping orders at a young fel-
low who was busy throwing his body
through seemingly impossible contortions

  well snapped the cold-eyed ruler-
class as he wheeled to face them what
do you want

  you manage jet-wheel jockeys replied
ossie determinedly i want to be one

  just like that sneered the fellow
quietly simple isnt it

  looked simple to me replied ossie
slowly

  and you too asked silas grinning
coldly at bris

  sure nodded the shorter man quietly

  suddenly the man stepped forward and
began slapping at ossie through his tunic
then he switched to bris suddenly again
he stopped as he felt the double joints of
briss arms

  we dont take seggies he growled
meaningly

  hes no seggie snarled ossie hes
got his card

at that kramph grinned slowly-a cruel
sly grin that came lingeringly to his
lips as he looked them over and then he
laughed

  you boys are just in from austral out-
back

  they nodded good that suited kramph
fine bris could see that well enough for
a moment or two kramph didnt speak and
ossie let his eyes wander round the large
room and saw that there were several jet-
jockeys busy working at the devices that
seemed designed solely to force them into
physical labor

  yeah grinned kramph lookhard
look real hard this is where a jockey
does his training some little gadgets i
thought up myself to get them in trim its
hard work mighty hard

  the moneys good isnt it ossie de-
manded quickly

  sure sure do like i say for a year
and you can switch that blue tunic for a
red silas mouthed eagerly

  then we arent afraid of work growled
ossie determinedly

  hadnt he done more than three hours
a day every day of his working life

  but just then the big gruff fellow they
had sighted at the stadium sidled up to
kramph and whispered something in his
ear the mans expression changed swiftly
and his eyes flashed as he wheeled towards
the boys into his hand flashed a trance
gun he levelled it carefully at ossie

  thought they were forbidden property
except to space boys drawled ossie when
he had recovered from his surprise

  maybe they are they can be bought
at a price i find one handy purred
kramph quietly

  whats the matter queried bris softly
why the sudden change whats wrong
with us

  you know too much purred silas
softly the police would be mighty inter-
ested to know what you overheard at the
stadium

  was right careless talking with you so
close bart stage the big gruff fellow
snarled why do you suppose i gave you

that card sure to get you here where
we could shut your mouth till things are
quiet again

   he laughed hoarsely but suddenly there
was a cry of terror from him as the trance-
gun was kicked swiftly round in his direc-
tion the blow came from ossie as he
threw his six-feet-two into action

   knowing that to attack immediately was
the most certain way he kicked up as he
lunged himself sideways at the same time
his boot caught the wrist of the gun-laden
hand and smashed it round with the trance-
gun dropping to the floor unfired then his
hands were streaking out for the throat of
the fat little man-kramph

   swiftly he had his gouging fingers locked
around the pudgy throat and was dragging
kramph close in against him bart stage
made an attempt to leap for the fallen gun
but bris acted quickly and kicked the fallen
weapon out of reach

   hold it ossie barked angrily first
fellow who moves will cost kramph his
life

   the jet-jockeys who had been exsreis-
ing at the machines stood around not know -
ing what to do slowly ossie backed toward
the door where they had come in but the
door was sealed against them and refused
to open

   fools grated kramph do you think
youll get away with this the place is
sealed get out if you can

   then he began laughing long taunting bel-
lows till ossie wrapped a long hand round
his throat and strangled off the sound
when he releaied the pressure he growled
at silas

   get them doors open fast

   the man hesitated a moment till the
fingers began to close on his throat again
and then he signalled and bart stage pressed
a section of the wall and the door came
open smoothly and the boys backed through
into the corridor and through bris whip-
ped a hand through the pockets of the
mans tunic and cleaned out all the gold
coin he could find

   in the front office they paused as the
flash female there loosed a yelp of sur-
prise with a sudden heave ossie flung the

tte

 man from him and raced into the street
 bris was close behind him and they dived
 on to the first stationary street car they
 came upon as they streaked away from
 kramphs headquarters

   in a moment the streamlined power of
 the craft had whisked them away and with-
 in a couple of minutes they were in the
 overhead routes and heading deep into the
 heart of the city

   that was a close call bris growled
 slowly jet-wheei jockeying must be
 tough

   but did you see that lay-out grinned

 ossie thats for me ill show that
 haughty pep-drink slinger

   why get riled over a dame you aint
 never seen before bris demanded
 theres plenty of females back in austral
 outback whod be glad to mate with you

   blue tunic bums snorted ossie in dis-
 gust jet-wheeling will pay off big you
 seen that lay-out

   kramphs a big operator cautioncd
 bris hell see we dont get far

   let him or anyone else try and stop
 me growled ossie well quit this buggy
 here and get ourselves a decent joint to bed-
 down

 bris knew his brother well enough to
 make no attempt to destroy his desire
 to remain in austral city though bris
 feared the consequences of their stay he had
 so long now taken ossies final word as
 law that he could not break the habit bris
 never forgot that he would have long ago
 been classed with the seggies had not the
jef-wheel jockey

efforts of his brother been devoted to his
cause

   so when ossie arrived back at the seg-
gies barracks with a beaming face he knew
that he had achieved his intention of find-
ing another manager who was prepared to
take them on as novices in the sport of jet-
svheeling he waited for his brother to ex-
plain what had happened

   ossie caught him up suddenly in his arms
and swung him round without effort it
was one of his favorite tricks when he was
feeling really pleased with himself

   were in ossie exulted as he set bris
down again bris kid were in

  in how do you mean bris asked not
knowing just what his brother may have
committed him to

   simple as anything laughed ossie from
his greater height  found a simple fel-
low who was looking for new riders
jockeys get killed off quickly it seems he
welcomed me like a lost friend till he sud-
denly decided he ought to warn me tried
to warn me off them told me the sport
was finished that the gamblers had made
it rotten with their threats and their cor-
ruption regular sermon he gave me
sounded just like the sort of thing the auth-
orities put over the videograph for the

seggies	

  sounds like a decent fellow drawled

bris quietly

   but ossie gave him little chancc to talk
he rushed him out from the barracks and
into the small strato-car which ossie now-
had at his command in this they were
whisked off

  where is this place bris demanded
at the first chance he got

  west answered ossie succinctly
there is a small stadium there where
well be riding once were trained

   but were heading east protested bris
quietly not understanding the turbulent
emotions that raced through his brothers
brain

  thats right easteast to the pep-
drink joint where that drink slinger works
ossie told him quickly no female like
her can give me the pass im going to
show her something

   in the shortest of time they were before
the pep-drink joint and ossie was stalking

his way inside in a wondering quiet way
bris followed into the long room where he
heard ossie greeting the girl familiarly

  have you changed your mind any about
me ossie was asking the dark girl with
the dazzling hair

  red tunic she said with an air of fin-
ality i can do better than that

  better than this ossie asked as he
lashed a bundle of notes of bigger value
than bris had seen in one workers hand
before

  the girls eyes opened wide and she
smiled with a slow come-on expresison to
her lips each sensuous curve of her body
was tinglingly alive with the invitation for
ossie to say more

  where did you get that she purred
through softened lips

  i took some advice you offered me
explained ossie good advicc were
signed up as jct-jockeys

  whered you get all that money asked
bris now that he had an opportunity for
the first time and where did you get that
strato-car

  i signed us both up with amsley
chuckled ossie quietly this is our first
months pay i borrowed the strato-car
from amsley

   bris nodded iid took the single note that
his brother slipped to him he knew ossie
and understood that he had turned his
charm loose on this fellow amsley as lie
alone could when the occasion arose and
there was no doubt that the man was now
convinced that he had signed up the two
best jet-wheelers in the game still it
onlv kramph would leave them alone it
would maybe work out all right in the end
it certainly would be nice to be able to wear
the red

  now beat it kid marian and i have to
get acquainted ossie advised his brother
quietly

  so bris left the pep-drink joint and
headed for the nearest stopping place of
the strcet-cars and waited there till he
could board a car that would give him a
connection with the west of the city once
at the stopping place nearest to the address

pace 
thrills incorporated

given on the paper ossie had given him he
left the car and walked down

   immediately he was well aware that this
 was no longer the elaborately decked-out
 area such as that in which kramph had
 his headquarters it was a poorer section
 of the city where workers lived and where
 factories bristled their giant vents up into
 the sky and down a side-street he found
 the address he was given and went slowly
 in through the entrance curiously he
 looked at the name of the plate by the
 door and saw that the man referred to by
 ossie as amsley was there mentioned as
 amslev castle and he grinned at the quick
 and easv familiarity with which his brother
 assumed a friendship with the manager of
 the jet-wheelers

   who is it youre looking for the gir
 at the desk requested politely

   am   mean castle he blurted
 quickly

    in the work-out room she said quietly
 pointing down the dingy hall to the dooi
 at the far end of the passage

   all around the small room young jet-
 wheelers were busy at exercise among
 them stood a short slight man in a red tunic
 from time to time he snapped advice to
 one or other of the boys who were work-
 ing out and then quite suddenly he turned
 round and stared hard at bris

   youre bris ortford he decided aloud
 come over here

 bris walked across and then castle
 slowly walked around him and looked
 him over  for a time he said nothing but
 then he nodded his head slowly

   not the specimen your brother is bui
 then hes an exception not many come
 like him these days ill make a jet-jockey
 of you if it means working you six hours

 a day

    six hours bris queried

    jct-iockeys have to be lit to ride those
 confounded machines the regulations insist
 are necessary to the sport growled castle
 then the seggies have to be kept in their
 place they need something that takes
 more than sleep-learning to accomplish to
 thrill them something like jet-wheeling
 the authorities insist they need it you rs
 going to help give it to them

   if ossie says so then i guess its all
 right bris replied with a heavy shrug of
 his shoulders

   in that gesture he made a movement with
 his arms that caused castles eyes to open
 wide and then the manager nodded toward
 a door leading from the room and said
 quietly

  come with me

   bris cursed himself for a fool he knew
 that he had made the mistake of flexing his
 second joint in his arms red tunics didnt
 take to the idea of having a seggy in their
 midst in the blue tunic of a worker once in
 the small office castle whirled on bris and
 nodded toward his arms

   your brother said nothing about those
 arms in his agreement with me whats the
 idea of posing as a worker

   bris fumbled through the pocket of his
 tunic and produced his card which gave him
 status as entitled to wear the blue of the
 worker class and he handed it to castle
 who took it and read it quickly then he
 nodded	

   youre all right then he frowned just
 the same it might be wise if we made cer-
 tain that the boys didnt get to know about
 those arms jet-wheelers that last long
 enough get to being of the red if the
 boysknew about those arms i guess theyd
 refuse to ride with you theres nothing
 like a class-climber to bear hatred against
 those below him

   for the tenth time since they hit austral
 citv bris was doubting the wisdom of bis
 brothers decisions but he lacked the init-
 iative to disapprove so he allowed himself
 to be taken off and plastic splints were soon
 moulded over his arms in such a way that
 only a normal wrist remained in evidence
 and even when he was stripped to the skin
 the splint did not show to the prying eyes
 of the boys who looked his skinny frame
 over with derisive eyes

   that first afternoon in the work-out room
 became a sort of hell of torture to bris who
 learned for the first time in his life that
 there were muscles in his body he had not
 dreamed existed and before castle called
 time to him each and every one of them had
 been subjected to a variety of treatments
 that left him completely exhausted then he
 was taken to the food-ray room where the
 thin blue hissing tube of the dispenser took

pace 
jef-wheel jockey

 close to five minutes to restore him to any
 feeling of well-being

  thats certainly some way to learn to
be a jet-wheeler he grinned at castle when
he was finally through

  the slight little manager laughed as he
tugged his wig into position

  thats nothing to the sort of thing they
did to the riders in the primaeval past when
they had a sport called bike racing  he
laughed if we were forced to train you
boys like they did then wed never get
riders mens bodies are no longer capable
of standing the strain without the aid of the
ray treatments already  have taken you
through a course of muscle-building that
would have thrown those primitive men
into weeks of what must have been torture
though the old records reveal nothing of
their complaints

rphree weeks slipped by and then a
fourth and during that time both the
boys worked harder than they had ever
believed it was possible for any man to
work they learned all that was known
to amslcy castle of jet-jockeying and that
was plenty the rigorous routines he forced
on them in the workout room built muscles
that were hard and tough

  almost every night when training was done
ossie would leave with his tunic and wig
secretly wrapped and many times he spoke
of the pep-drink girl marian and more often
still of olgar

  then almost before bris and ossie had
been taught the last dirty trick of the jet-
wheel stadium races they were listed as
riders in the same race it was the first
event on the programme at the small
western stadium where castle raced his
boys for days past they had practised the
course and castle had issued the necessary
warnings about keeping clear of the dan-
ger line on the track-not taking the cor-
ners at too high a speed-and a tip about
one or two riders who would be in opposi-
tion to them	 

  at the track in the afternoon he called
them aside before the warning light flashed
for them to get their jet-wheels on to the
track prior to the start

  take it easy boys he cautioned them
ive put a lot into you and i want it back
dont take risks and dont try and win

youre in this race for experience and noth-
ing more

  according to regulations all jet-wheels
are powered the same arent they he
queried softly

  thats right nodded castle hoarsely
but there are ways of getting round that
a little your wheels and all the wheels my
boys ride have a little extra pep when need-
ed but you boys remember that youre in
this for the ride

  youre betting against us growled
ossie angrily

  ill tell you when that happens snap-
ped castle just remember osland-you
are not a champion yet youre in debt
heavily to me and ill tell you what to do
and when to do it

  the prize for this race would clear us
wouldnt it asked ossie quietly

  amsley castle nodded he didnt get a
chance to do more for the warning light
lashed and attendants got the jet-wheels
lircd and shot through the entrance hatches
on to the mile circuit of the track

  once the last jet-wheel was through the
hatches they were closed down to form a
part of the track itself and the jet-wheels
moved around in their warming-up spin at
slow speeds

  fiercely competitive the jet-jockeys gave
no friendly smiles to each other of the
ten riders who were taking part in the event
ossie and bris were the only two who came
from the castle headquarters and the other
eight riders were divided up among four
other outfits

  this pair racing was a development that
had come early in the sport of jet-wheeling
in austral city for it was found that with the
gamblers operating it was very often neces-
sary to have a partner to stave off the
attempts of ones rivals to put a dangerous
rider out of action

  at the slow speed at which they ap-
proached the starter it required skill to keep
the jet-wheels erect and bris exerted all his
concentration all down the straight to that
end with the flash to go he heard the wild
veils of the onlookers for the first time and
he thrust his throttle wide as his machine
leapt into a racing pace down the first
straight towards the corner where the
bunchcd riders shot high up into the curve

page 
thrills incorporated

 to act round the bend and then shot down
 and through the next corner into the back
 straight

   on instructions from castle he should
 be sticking with ossie but in the badiy
 bunched riders he could not distinguish the
 marking color of his brothers jet-wheel
 lap one of the track flashed under his
 machine without mishap and then as they
 entered lap two he saw a jet-wheel go into
 a slide and fall ahead of the front bunch

    the bunch split throttled their jet-wheels
 high up the wall and round the crashing
 machine and there in the midst ol that
 racing pack bris sighted the distinguishing
 colorof his brothers jet-wheel determined
 to follow castles instructions as best he
 - could he gave his wheel extra power and
 the blast from the atomic jets thrust his
 machine forward into a mad raec that
 hurtled him past the second bunch of
 jockeys and into the front line of riders

   once there he teamed with his brother
 and tried to contact him through the vidco-
 graph but found that his brothersjddco
 seemed to be out of action castles face
 flashed on his own screen

 pet out ol that bunch castle warned
   vj him those boys play rough

   bris eased back but found that ossu
 wasnt going with him and so he closed in
 again and stayed with him as they hit the
 bend into the fourth lap lap fifteen came
 up and apart from minor jostling for posi-
 tion the situation was unchanged with
 castle sending desperate messages for them
 to quit and get clear ossie wouldn t give
 ground and bris decided not to quit with-
 out him	 

   then bris saw trouble coming a ocke
 was coming in to force ossie up beyonc
 the dancer line as they hit the comer oui
 of the straight almost automatically after
 the drillingcastle had given him bris
 throttled his jet-wheel in to counter the
 play trapped between the team-mates
 the threatening jockey smartly dropped back
 out of danger for bad trouble loomed tor

 hllbris throttled sharply through a tight-
   bunched field and warded ofl the attack and
   he himself shot to the front with onlv a
   lap to so then the wild screams coming
   from the seggies told him that something

 was coming behind him and he flung his
 machine high towards the line ol danger to
 stop a jet-wheel passing him but skim-
 ming along the danger line at a terrific pace
 the other jockey roared his machine past
 him and as they flashed into the final run
 down the straight he recognised the jet-
 wheel colors as those of his brothers mach-
 ine almost together they crossed the line
 but ossies number went up and when they
 hit the hatches to return to the pits again
 they were met with amsley castle who was
 fuming with anger

   what sort of fool riding was that he

demanded angrily	

   i won didnt  demanded ossie as he
 was released from his jet-wheel

  of course you did snapped castle
 irritablv and put voursclf into the next
 class up before  couid collect on a win in

class 	

   collect the prize-money and consider
 us square laughed ossie  put a little
 in the machines on myself

the little that ossie had put in the
machines on himself served very well
for the plans he had and marian was de-
lighted with the strato-car which lie pur-
chased for himself and also with the pre-
sents of glimmering delight he purchased
for her never before in her haughty con-
icmpt of the blue had she dreamed that
her beauty would purchase for her such a
mate as this strong one from austral out-
back

    as she entered herself beside ossie at
 night delight  she was conscious ol the
 jealous looks that the various men in red
 threw in her direction at least she assumed
 thev were for her some thought came once
 or twice that she might do better than ort-
 ford who now masqueraded nightly as be-
 longing to the red but each time such a
 thought came she knew that this man had
 a grip on her emotions that was more than
 material she had come to feel toward him
 the true mate spirit of which the video
 spoke at times she knew she was tied to
 this man now whether he were to climb
 from the blue to the true red or whether he
 were to be thrown back in disgrace to serve
 a sentence with the seggies

  marian was wrong about those jealous
  looks many a red tunic looked on them
jet-wheci jockcy

coming in with jealous regard but this feel-
ing was cast at ossie those sccret whispers
that circulated through the night delights
lold that this newcomer was one who sought
the attentions of olgar the fire-danccr
olgar the unattainable

  more than one wished he could remove
ossie from their midst but his obvious
wealth stayed any hints to the police for an
investigation such a way was dangerous
it was more than possible that he belonged
to the secret police and was set to spy upon
the reds of night delight 

   so night after night ossie sat unmolested
at his table and drank his full of pep-pep-
drink and watched eagerly for the appear-
ances of olgar when she danced through
the sheets of flame in the pink softness of
her skin and the tresses of her flame-colored
hair every nerve of the man was awakened
to dreams of pneumatic pleasure

dut as the days passed ossie ceased at-
tending night delight  for the simple
reason that his money was exhausted and
a stubborn amsley castle refused to ad-
vance him further cash and also refused
to allow either of the boys to ride at the
stadium but he kept them at their training
till they became heartily sick of the work-
out room and the other boys who exercised
there finally ossie taxed his manager and
demanded a ride the following day

  we need the cash he growled heavily
we havent ridden in days and were letting
time slip by wasted how can we make
money for you if we dont ride

  at least you cant lose it for me like
in your first race snapped castle in re-
ply

  come amsley ossie smiled taking a
new tack you said you didnt stand to
lose on those other riders how was i to
know what plans you had you didnt tell
us

  just then the door opened from the front
entrance and a slight figure of a softly
garbed woman came into the work-out
room in surprise amsley moved across
and held out a hand to welcome the woman

  laura he said what are you doing
here

  ive heard about your new riders and
the sensation they made at the stadium the
other day why didnt you tell me you

know how dull the city stadium has been
lately ive come to see those new jockeys
ride

   but     castle flustered helplessly 

  but what laura asked

  im not letting them ride tor the time
being castle told her weakly  ihev dis-
obeyed orders we of the red cant toleraic
that

  laura the silent one was not disposed
to be silent now she tossed her head and
snorted her disgust

   we of the red she queried softly and
castles face bashed in a crimson blush
we of the red i who trace an unblem-
ished family tree through seventeen genera-

tions say that i am of the red had it not
been for your eyes and your hair before
baldness robbed you of it i would never
have been fool enough to vote vou into the
red

   as you say my dear lie purred quietly

   are these the jet-jockeys she demand-
ed then pointing at ossie and bris

  castle nodded and introduced them
ossie bowed lower than was necessary and
was not mistaken into believing that laura
was as young as she appeared he knew
that age could be held in check for a strctch
of years for those who were wealthy enough
to obtain the treatments but he saw
castles mate now as a means to an end and
he smiled on her with a hint of interest that
sent a preening hand to the womans hair

   amsley is fortunate to have such a true
red to mate ossie told her smoothly
bris and i would be delighted to race and
win before you at the stadium

  then you will she decided quietly
this afternoon see that they are entered
for their class race she added as she turned
back towards the door to leave

paee

 at the stadium before the first event they
 were idling their time away close to the back
 of the reds stand when bris gripped his
 brother by the arm and grunted a warning
 trouble he said quickly

  as ossie turned to look he sighted
 kramph moving up toward them he was
 still the same cold-eyed grinning man with
 his round pudgy face and his small gro-
 tesque body when he was a yard away
 from them he slopped and smiled hugely

  silas kramph never forgets his old
 friends he purred how are you boys
 its good to see you looking so fit

  what do you want snarled ossie
angrily

   you boys are wiser than some silas
 kramph pointed out softly you know
 how to keep your mouth shut and say
 nothing thats very wise

   thats not what you came to tell us
 bris cut in quietly say whatever it is
 and get out

   ive been checking on you boys replied
 kramph softly still youre going to be
 favorites for the fourth event but my
 monev will say that you lose is that clear

   what if we dont remember that asked
 ossie snarling out the words

   ive been patient for a long while ban
 is getting restless you boys have been
 around tong enough to know what that
 means purred the gambler softly

   and then before either of the boys had
 time to make a reply the paunchy little
 man had wheeled round suddenly and
 headed away from them it was as easy
 as that to him in a moment they were
 alone and looking at each other with inquir-
 ing looks	 

hes not a man to cheat bris said

quietly	 

   scared taunted ossie quietly

 but bris had his own ideas about who
 was going to win the event and he
 knew that his secret training on the track
 hadnt been wasted also he knew that lack
 of sleep and too much pep-pep-drmk had re-
 duced the benefits of castles preparation

of ossie	 

   laura will be here to see us win snap-
 ped ossie angrily seventeen generations
 without a black gene in the family tree puts
 her among the top reds weve got to

 please her if we want to wear the red our-
 selves we got to

   whichever way you want it ossie i hat
 is the way itll be

   then well laugh in the face ot that
 gambling fool replied ossie quietly im
 not squaring off with him to miss with
 laura shes too important to us

   by the time the fourth event came up
 the boys were moving nervously beside their
 machines one class above the bottom now
 they were meeting more experiencd jockeys
 and knew that the race would be faster than
 their previous run as they were strapped
 in position by their attendants amsley
 arrived and growled

   if you boys know whats good for you
 youll win this race

   time didnt allow the boys to express
 any such feelings on the subject for soon
 they were shot through the hatches on to
 the track and as they moved off slowly for
 a first circuit of the course they caught sight
 of laura in the official stand and she waved
 at them through the transparent track

   it seemed to the boys that they were rid-
 ing the air over the heads of the seggies as
 they crowded down under the track to get
 the best possible view of the race from
 their bad positions on the course

   the flash of light the start ten jet-
 wheels flashed into action and roared their
 way round the track with number ten soar-
 inghigh on to the roof at the first corner and
 sending his machine full blast into the sec-
 ond bend at a speed which left the field well
 behind

   on their video screens flashed a message
 from castle

   stay on his tail you fools don t try and
 pass him yet

   lap ten was over and no change in posi-
 tion was registered but at lap twelve ossie
 signalled bris who responded immediately
 with a burst of speed in the back corner that
 sent his jet-wheel screaming down for an
 opening on the inside of the track

   while on the outside of the track ossie
 and the jockey who was now third were
 duelling for position with neither daring to
 make full pace so close to the rim of the
 track but when at the comemncement of
 lap eighteen ossie realised that bris was
 creeping more and more into the lead he

pane 
jet-wheel jockey

suddenly gave up his struggle and cut his
throttle wide and flashed through the two
corners after leaving the straight at a speed
that seemed certain to shoot him to his
doom

always he had kept bris under his wing
and away from trouble and now it
seemed that bris was fighting for the winning
position the second last corner found the
boys slightly clear of the previously leading
pair and as they swept into the straight for
the winning line bris gave his jet everything
the throttle had and he leaped ahead to gain
the race by a yard

  as they circlcd the track again to slow
their machines before going out through
the hatches to the pits the face of kramph
flashed on to their video screens and it was
flushed and angry

  youll be hearing from me was all
the infuriated gambler barked at them be-
fore he cut off

  i want you boys to come to a little
party to-night laura told them when they
could pay their respects

  delighted grinned ossie turning to
shake his brothers hand with a magnani-
mous gesture that was proof to laura and
all present that he didnt mind his team-
partner stealing the honor from him

  but underneath this calm acceptance
ossie felt the stirrings of reproach annoy-
ance and a sort of wonderment he found
it hard to believe bris had stolen the race
from him never had he reckoned on bris
as anything but someone whom he cared
enough about to protect and take care to
keep out of trouble

  while bris returned quietly to tcani-
headquarters to rest ossie had a lot of
arranging to do to settle that he could not
be at the night delight  even though he
was once more financial enough then he
returned to the headquarters and rested too
but he found it hard to relax

  long ago he had determined that nothing
short of the championship of the city stad-
ium would do him as a goal and now he
could feel that his grip on that possibility
was slipping away with every effort made by
bris he glanced across to the other divan
and saw his brother resting peacefully and
cursed the nervous tension that kept him
awake then he glanced at the arms lying
on the divan opposite and knew that finally

he would not be defeated finally it would
be he who climbed to the very top he
and he alone and at the top were many
things the one that ossie called most fre-
quently to mind was the writhing form of
olgar and no sense of shame blotted his
thoughts society would never know
secrecy in such matters was all that mat-
tered

a msley castle was well pleased
 with his two new ace jockeys of the jet-
whccl stadium and more so this day for he
had succeeded in pleasing laura and that
had been increasingly difficult of late now
with her good graces and the money he was
certain to make from his new stars of the
track he was certain that the way lay open
to him that led to-olgar

  later a little after seven an elaborate
strato-car came to a stop outside the castle
jet-jockev headquarters and from it stepped
a blue-tunicked attendant who asked for the
orlford boys they were promptly awak-
ened and hurried to the waiting car and
immediately they were seated the door
sealed shut and the atomic-powered vehicle
raced them away

  some day for us grinned bris happily
 imagine kramph will think awhile before
looking for us now that laura is taking an
interest in us

   guess so nodded ossie without en-
thusiasm seventeen generations of un-
blemished anccstry means a lot nowadays
this segregation policy is getting more and

cause enough trouble now for a wearer of
the red to be caught with one on rendez-
vous

  heh shouted bris excitedly were
heading west away from the city-not
north-east towards lauras

  swiftly ossie checked direction and then
leapt towards the door and slammed his
hand hard against the escape lever it
failed to work and as he turned back the
cynically leering face of the man kramph
flashed on the small video screen before the
boys his voice boomed

 then the screen went blank and ossie	on earth would have laughed at the clumsi-

the cold-eyed face of silas kramph was
flashing on their video screen and his voice
purring its fury at them

   meant to use you again the voice
snarled now youre finished im seeing
to that personally

  but ossie laughed back and called a
taunting invitation to kramph for in the
distance he could see police scouts search-
ing the air and he headed straight toward
them within seconds their craft were
circling the strato-car as the boys flashed
them a message and then the convoy turned
back towards austral city ahead of the
boys waited the utile party held by laura
in their honor

inside the home of laura and amsley
castle the guests awaited the boys ar-
rival and police waited to question them
ossie thinking quickly took the lead and
denied they knew anything of the cause of
tie kidnapping and beating and also denied

that they had been threatened with trouble
if they did not lose the race that afternoon
but once they were alone for a moment
bris anxiously asked what this was about
and ossie smiled

  they wouldnt get kramph and his
gang he said quietly they must have
friends among the highest authorities and
wed only be inviting certain death if we
were to inform on them

  but kramph had promised to get us
anyway bris growled i dont want an-
other going over like that we were lucky
to-day

  kramph knows where his money comes
from hell be more sensible now that he
has time to think things over ossie told
his brother confidently didnt i tell you
we were going to the top thi- is it look

around were the only blue tunics here
doesnt that mean something here comes
laura leave us alone ive got something
in mind

  a moment later laura came up to ossie
and he smiled in such a way that it was a
compliment to her then after they had
talked for a time they drifted away as if
by mutual agreement to an apartment room
that was vacant when they arrived for
more than an hour then ossie proved to
laura that austral outback men were not
the dullards city women might believe them
and then with the wife of his manager re-
laxed and smiling he suggested quietly

  it wouldnt be wise for a blue to be
seen with you too often

  thats true she sighed regretfully
thats true what a pity you ace not one
of us

  a vote can make a red of a blue sug-
gested ossie quietly a vote from such
a highly-placed person as yourself

  she smiled sadly

  not any more she shook her head
quietly new decrees have been issued
only exceptional cases now can be raised
in class through such a vote

  such as he suggested with less en-
thusiasm

  the champion jet-jockey of the city
stadium might be such a one laura told
ossie quietly now we must go back or
amsley will be wondering come ill go
part way with you and then leave you to
find your own way from there on

  he smiled even the highest of the reds
were not above such little intrigues per-
haps it was just as well and in such a
frame of mind bris found him again in the
main hall where the guests were drinking
their rounds of pep-pep-diink and watching
the dancing of the entertainers from night
delight  who had been engaged for the
evening

 pwo weeks passed during which the

  	boys rocketed to success and cham-
pionship of the small stadium under the
watchful eyes and guardianship of amsley
castle with the boys his fortunes soared
and he was well pleased even laura seem-
ed content to leave him be and castle de-

lighted in the new freedom that came with
the tide of his success

   then came the time when ossie finished
his workout and turned to amslev with a
frowning face slowly the jet-wheel jockey
asked

  when are we riding at the city
stadium

   theyre rotten right through in there
castle replied slowly ive kept you boys
straight all the way two days in there and
theyd kill you both

   thats rot ortford growled savagely
i want that championship ill take the
risks but you get me the rides at cit
stadium i know what im after

   i guess i stick with ossie bris told him
 quietly we always stick-ossie and i

   all right nodded amsley in resigna-
tion ill get you a ride for the champion
ship but dont say i didnt warn you

  qssie laughed there was a glint ol
recklessness in his blue eyes now right to
the very top he could see it there was no
stopping him there was nothing in bis
way now but that one thing the red was
as ood as his then-position wealth
power and freedom the top and nothing
to stop him

   bfit his smiling expression changed sud-
denly when he entered their apartment just
ahead of his brother a deep frown creased
his face as he glared at the girl with dazz-
ling black hair who rose from a divan ner-
vously marian

   i thought i told you   ossie begar
angrily

   but you promised broke in the girl
anxiously i dont care any more about
the presents and the color of your tunic i
dont care about anything-only you she
pleaded

   whats the matter asked bris look-
ing with sympathy at the girl

   this pep-drink slinger still wants to
keep me to a promise i made to become her
official mate her-a blue tunic laughed
ossie hoarsely what sort of a fool does

she think me

  you could do worse snapped his
brother with more anger than he had evei
shown to ossie before	

   so youre at it again taunted ossie de-
 risively wanting to quit again

  pagt 

  no one said anything about quitting
not a thing but   

   then theres nothing more to it snap-
ped ossie quickly no blue female is go-
ing to hold me back give a red mate
card to her he scoffed as he pointed at
marian

   for a minute then there was a silence as
the girl stood and stared at him without a
sign of emotion on her stony face then
almost as if she were in a dream she turned
and quit the room when she was gone
bris wheeled on to his brother and began
to speak but ossie cut him short quickly
with

  time  was leaving ive got business
o attend to

three days later amsley castle came to
the boys and his face was bleak for
a while he just looked at them and then
he announced in a voice that was cold and
defeated

  im sorry boys he told them 
cant get you a ride at the city stadium
kramph has the whole place tied round his
fingers and he decides who the next cham-
pion is to be he and no one else that
stadiums crooked from beginning to end
theres not a hope in austral of getting
vou boys a ride there

  didnt he offer terms asked ossie
quickly he couldnt have flatly refused to

 talk business

  yes he had terms admitted castle
quietly crooked dirty terms terms
that a martian mutant wouldnt accept from
the lowest segay in austral one

  there wasnt anvthing more to be said
about it then and the group broke up but
at the first opportunity ossie slipped away
and headed for the east outside kramph s
headquarters he left the strato-car parked
in line and walked straight through without
a sideways glances at the alluring girl at the

desk	

   into the work-out room he went and-then
through it into kramphs office when the
managed couldnt be sighted among the jet
jockeys groups kramph was sitting be-
hind a desk comfortably waiting and the
smile of pleasure on his face told that he
knew of ossies arrival long before the jet-
wheeler had reached the work-out room
jet-wheel jockey

  well grinned the cold-eyed gambler
we meet again i thought id see you here
before you were through what is it

  i want the championship of the city
stadium snapped ossie bluntly i could
ride any and all your boys off the track
im entitled to that championship

  the manager thrust back his head and
laughed it wasnt a pleasant sound but
came from deep down in his chest in a
grating rattle that was sinister and un-
moved then he leered

   you owe me plenty he laughed again
and youll pay it all for the championship
every last bit of it-and more

  what are your terms ossie demanded
savagely

  that afternoon at the stadium amsley
castle was more excited than usual before
the commencement of the boys event he
had staked a tremendous sum on the paii
to win and he issued the last minute instruc-
tions to them before they were strapped into
position in the saddles of their jet-wheels
ossie nodded that he understood and then
they waited to catch the flash of the warn-
ing light that would send them on to the
track for the warming up spin

   as they waited the voice grated from the
video screens around the track

   in this event the champion partners of
this track will defend the title againsi the
champions from tracks one four seven
and eight

  then he called a list of names and the
segsies and workers went to the machines
to drop their coins in at their favorite slots
and collect their numbered discs all the
small stadiums were fairly close to the
castle headquarters and he had arranged
this trial championship as a special award
for the boys and as a sort of peace offering
for his failure to secure them a champion-
ship ride at the city stadium

  betting was confused for seggies and
workers knew all ten riders but had never
seen the five pairs in competition and in
this scramble castle was sure of getting bet-
ter odds than ever about his boys from the
machines for this reason he had gambled
heavily confident that they could not be
beaten

  the warning light flashed and the jei-
wheels were thrust through the hatches on
to the transparent track through which the

crowd was able to see the ten jet-wheels
circling the track for the first time bris
rode close to ossie in his normal position
and they gathered speed and gave a speedy
wind around the circuit then checking
their pace they moved into the straight to-
wards the start with the other machines
lining-up carefully for the running start

  go they were off racing up to the first
corner at a pace that was recklessly fast
for the clumsy jet-wheels seggies were
vellins madly at the spectacle as ten wheels
took the first corner in a bunch and roared
high up into the second bend with those
on the inside forcing the riders towards the
dangerous rim of the track

  ossie was on the extreme outside and
battled his machine into that of his brother
and this in turn forced bris into the one
closest him and so they fought their way
down into the long straight with every
jockey checking his speed now to secure a
reasonable position for the next few laps

  then bris sensing the advantage of be-
ing well clear of the tight packed bunch of
wheelers signalled ossie and shot his
machine rocketing forward with his throttle
wide open the extra power that came
from his jet-wheel now surprised him and
he flashed into the lead with ossie following
through on the outside

  in the stand with the red tunics amsley
castle grinned with a private satisfaction
as he saw that his secret addition to the
fuel had given an extra throttling power to
the jet-wheels his boys jockied but be-
fore thev had hit lap eight ossie was in the
lead and in trouble with his machine wobb-
ling dangerously in front of briss racing

wheel	

  desperately bris tried to get round his
brothers machine as the other jockeys
closed in on them as the boys checked their
speed in a very few seconds in the ninth
lap the whole field passed the boys leaving
ossie and bris trailing but then with half
a lap gone by and the distance from the
field increased it seemed that ossie got his
wheel under control and they raced in pur-
suit of their rivals again

  as the boys fought their way back close
to the leading bunch of riders the seggies
rose in an excited multitude and cheered
and yelled their favorites orf five laps
passed with the battle swaying in the balance

page 
thrills incorporated

and bris and ossie trying to force their way
through the tight-packed field

   a rider fell sending two more down and
leaving an opening through during the
eighteenth lap with full throttle power
bris raced his machine through and tight
on his tail came ossie who was riding sup-
erbly now

   they were clear and with but two riders
ahead of them as they flashed into the first
corner of the last lap speed was the essence
of the struggle now only the most skillful
and reckless riding combined could get
them home winners

tdiding on the outside bris signalled his
a- partner and then shot high into the
bend with full throttle and hit the roof of
the track with a jarring of muscles and
bones as he fought his jet-wheel down into
the back straight he was riding close on
the heels of the leading jockey and went
into the second last corner with his jet roar-
ing at full power

   too much speed thrust him high and he
was forced to cut his pace desperately to
avoid the plunge over the brim wild with
excitement then bris caught sight of ossie
flashing towards the lead again but when
bris swooned to join him ossie lost control
again and they wavered over the track to-
wards the outside as they shot into the
straight with a rider shooting through on the
side nearest the centre to steal the race by
a wheel from ossie with bris less than a
half wheel away third

   back in the pits castle stared at ossie
with angry eyes and snarled out viciously

   what sort of fool riding was that what
was wrong with you

  we were going too fast defended
ossie humbly  couldnt keep control

   bris glared at him and amsley turned
away and left them the greatest wager he
hadever made had been lost and there was
nothing he could do-nothing but bris
reckoned that he could do something and
when they were alone he turned to his
brother and demanded savagely

   what did you get for losing that race

  ossie toughed and slapped his back
heartily then he replied

  a chance at the title at the city
stadium

  you sold out-sold out to kramph

   put it that way if you want to defended
his brother quietly weve got a chance
to ride for the title now and thats what we
want

  what you want snapped bris ready
to quit i never did want to get mixed
with the rotten game to gain a red its
crooked and dirty from end to end

  look kid said ossie quietly take
it easy stop trying to ride me into anger
youve done ail right sticking with me
stay with me now and youll still do all
right

  and what about castle bris wanted
to know

   hell do all right ossie assured him
quietly we can repay all the money he
lost on us this afternoon and square him
with more than that weve got to think of
ourselves kid were the best team in the
jet-wheeling were entitled to the cham-
pionship at the city stadium

   but it isnt worth cheating for bris
snapped angrily

   at this ossie pointed to the plastic skin
which hid the mutant second wrists in briss
arms and he demanded slowly

  what would you call those plastic
splints isnt that cheating

  there was acid in his words and with
these questions briss shoulders slowly
slumped and he dropped his head and
nodded

  all right you always have an answer
for everything ill tag with you

  then well pack our gear and head for
kramphs headquarters straight away there
is no point in waiting to see castle well
leave a message that were through with
him

  whatever you say nodded bris dully

  together they hurried back to castles
jet-wheel headquarters and packed their
gear and were soon leaving the place in
ossies strato-car it had always been
ossies car though bris had been thinking
lately that it had been his share of their
earnings that had gone into the purchase
price that ought to have made it his but
somehow he didnt ever think it- worth his
while to point this out to his brother

  nor did he mention the two or three
times he had gone round to the pep-drink
joint to pass a word or two with marian
the last time he had seen her she had beeu

page 
jet-wheel jockey

looking sick but she denied there was any-
thing wrong with her when bris had tried io
probe it was tough on the girl and some-
how bris felt responsible for his brothers
actions perhaps when he had won the
championship he would null up sharp and
see things straight perhaps but when
bris was half way honest with himself he
didnt believe anything could straighten
ossie out in his thinking till he was right
at the top with his red tunic and his assured
position

t ramph welcomed the boys with a
slick smile and glinting eyes

   im glad you bovs have seen the sensible
thing to do at last he purred softly as he
showed them to their apartment in his ultra-
modern headquarters saves us all a lot
of trouble

   guess we know where the monev is
ossie said quietly i swore a long while
ago that i was going right to the top and
thats where im going he added with a
tone of hard determination

  the championship is yours smiled
kramph quietly but not just yet awhile
there are a few races before that one

  ossie wheeled on his new master and
glared angrilv at him

  that was no part of our deal he
growled out i had to lose that race to set
our chance at the championship

  now be reasonable kramph replied
smoothly see it this wav i lost a lot ol
money when you boys didnt play along
with me before surely i have a right to
get it back

  for a moment ortford stood up to
kramph but he saw the mans hand hover-
ing close to that bulge beneath his tunic and
he shrugged his shoulders and turned
away

  all right  suppose weve got to pay
for that he growled out but dont keep
us waiting toolong

   it wont be long before you get whats
coming to you kramph assured them
quietly just a few races

  that night ossie didnt meet laura as
usual but got a video connection and spoke
with her for a time before he explained that
he had other things to do then when he
had donned his red turnc and his wig he
haded for the pep-drink joint and there
pet marian

   hello he smiled quietly ive conic
to see you

   for a moment then the girls eyes lighted
but they soon dulled again for she could
see no grounds for hope after all that had
been said but the jet-jockeys next words
set her listening

   i had to break with you -when i thought
id never get to be champion he ex-
plained glibly now well now ive got
the chance and well be at the top-just like
we planned im taking you to night de-
light  to-night just like old times

  once at that hot spot of the authoritarian
 class ossie made his excuse and quit his

table when olgar had finished her first
dance routine behind the stage he found
his way through a maze of short passages
of sparkling floors and walls and by suit-
able bribes arrived at the door of the fire-
dancer from the moon those who had seen
him come could forget quickly for they
were seggies and the bribes had been large

   inside the palatially appointed dressing
room he smiled his warmest smile and all
the fierce desire came out into his eyes
swiftly he spoke words that he had not
known he knew words deep with a fiery
passion olgar laughed

   even below the martian mutant do you
of the red place me she told him softly
yet the richest and most powerful of you
vie with each other for what  can give
who are you to come seeking

   i am osland ortford he announced
proudly future champion jet-wheeler at
the city stadium i offer twice the sum
ever offered before

   only then did she unbend to smile on
him and ossie suddenly felt cold and damp
perspiration crept from his skin in a
stealthy trickle for somewhere deep within

page 
thrills incorporated

him was awakened the horror of this
stranger to earth this female of the pink
flesh and flame colored hair from the moon
who could defy the ravages of fire and dance
within the circle of flame the primitive
fear of the strange was full awake within
him and he wanted to quit but he could not

   above all else he had to get to the top
that unswerving drive was compelling him
to have all things that other men desired
and olgar was chief among them but that
fierce desire for her that had been his own
and truly now could he see why she was
loathed as beneath that lowest of all things
-the martian mutant she was a snare
and a trap that defiled

   but he stayed and watched her tantalis-
ing rhythms and finally his pleading won
through when he was jet-wheel champion
and entitled to wear the red he now usurped
and had double the sum she mentioned
they would talk again he agreed then
almost eagerly he hurried back to marian
and the warmth of her humanity

during the next week the brothers won
several races and lost three and all
the while kramph worked his plans and
collected the gambling fortunes poured into
the machines by the seggies and the work-
ers but he was never foolish enough to
have them lose all the time and many went
home from the city stadiums with sums of
winnings that meant fortunes to them truly
they thought jet-wheeling was a rare and
worthwhile sport

  then towards the end of the second
week after ossie had lost three races run-
ning to his brother kramph called him into
his office off his workout room and sat him
down ossie wondered but not for long
kramph came straight to the point

  its about bris he growled out with
seeming anger i thought you were to be
champion when i gave you your chance at
the title

  thats right nodded ossie solemnly
im to be champion of the stadium

  then what about bris demanded
kramph belligerently that mutant seggy
is beating you too often three times in a
row now how can  make you champion
with that going on

   ossie was angry but he wasnt sure about
what he tried to tell himself that it was

because kramph knew the secret of his
brothers arms and had called him a seggy
he tried to believe that he was angry about
that but somehow he couldnt then he
was forced to admit that he himself had
been worrying in the secret places of his
mind about his brothers successes they
came too frequently and despite the fact
that bris was more than six inches shorter
than himself he knew that he was a favor-
ite with the mob-the great yelling crowd
who offered up their pay to the yawning
jaws of the gambling machines day after
day

  well kramph growled angrily when
ossie did not reply for some time

  ill talk to him ossie snapped back in
reply tell him im to be champion and
hes got to give up winning

  kramph made a noise that might have
been a scoff of derision or it might have
been a splutter of disgust but when he
looked up there was no doubt from his ex-
pression how he felt about bris

  a seggy he spluttered disgustedly
youll talk to him treat him like a human
being tell him to stop youre a fool
hes got his ticket his blue snapped
ossie savagely hes my brother

  for a while kramph just looked at him
and smiled slowly then when he spoke
his voice was silky smooth and quiet in the
big room

   hes a seggy despite his ticket he spat
suddenly while ever he is racing i cant
give you a chance to win the championship
now if  he paused a moment and ossie
growled

 go on

  no youre sentimental you believe
hes a human like the rest of us with aims
like that seggy nothing more

  go on barked ortford again

   if he werent racing anymore    if 
well if he met with an accident  a
serious one serious enough to put him
out of the stadium for good well there
wouldnt be any chance then of anyone but
you being champion purred kramph
softly	n

  ossie didnt say anything to that for
quite a time and then he nodded quietly

  an accident of course that would
put him out of jet-wheel jockeying for a
spell

page 
  a long spell kramph grinned quietly
youre racing to-morrow-why not then

  an accident ortford was saying over
to himself as he got up from the seat and
left the office

  that night when he saw laura he talked
about it-talked for a long while and laura
the quiet one said little but at last she
murmured close to his ear

  you belong with us

  that was all she said nothing more
but somehow it troubled ossie more than
anything he wanted to get to the top get
where the futility of his father had failed
to get him but now he hesitated

  jet-wheeling was crooked right through
and it was his only ladder from a blue
tunic and short hair to the red and long
hair there wasnt any other way and
kramph controlled jet-wheeling

  the pudgy little man with the cold grey
eyes could hand him a red or take it away
kramph was his master ortford didnt
sleep well that night and the following
morning exercised lightly in the work-out
room and the other boys watched him and
his brother with distaste

bris and ossie were outsiders - men
from austral outback they had no
right in the city challenging the jet-wheel
jockeys of the city and among the jet-
wheelers feeling was high against the boys
who had beaten them more than once and
who seemed to be favorites with kramph

  but before the race the following day
kramph came up to ossie and demanded
quietly

  to-day and in answer ossie gave
a short nod of his head

  to this kramph grinned slyly and moved
away and gave his own instructions to his
other jockeys then he went back and set
his money through the gambling machines
and received his numbered discs in ex-
change

  packed to capacity the stadium was a
frenzied mob of howling seggies and low-
grade workers after the leading rider had
lost control and been swept off the track
in the third event another jet-wheeler
proved the wisdom of the decree that had
lone ago been issued that no red tunic
could compete in the stadiums unless his
tunic had been first won there

jet-wheel jockey

   then came the fourth event and bris and
ossie were strapped to their saddles and
their jets set ready as the jet-wheels rested
in their supports prior to being pushed
through the hatches on to the tracks bris
looked over at his brother and grinned

  ive got news he whispered softly
ive been reading up the rules of die
stadium and theres one that we need to
know it says any jet-wheel jockey who
breaks the track record time automatically
becomes the champion this is our
chance

  suddenly a lot of things snapped into
place in ossies plans and he glanced back

at his brother and signalled his agreement
bris made an attempt to say something
more but before he could get it out the
warning light flashed and the jet-wheels
were thrust through the hatches on to the
track and began their preliminary circuits
before the start of the race

  warmed up the ten jet-wheels came
slowly up to the start and crashed into in-
stant action as the go signal flashed at the
start ten men with definite orders charged
into the first corner with throttles wide open
and roared high up on to the roof of the
track as their terrific speed swooshed them
down into the second corner and down the
back straight

   three point eight four minutes was drum-
ming through the mind of ossie as he gave
his jet all the throttle power he had and
flashed into the bottom corners less than
a lensth behind the main bunch and with
bris racing at his side on the video screen
he switched a dial and got the time-clock
image clearly and grinned as they crashed
through the finish for a fast first lap

  never for a long while at the city
stadium had the fans had such a thrilling

race with eight riders hugging together in a
bunch and keeping just ahead of the broth-
ers at a pace that was screeching them
through the comers in a tight-packed bunch
that seemed almost as one giant racing
round the track

  five laps slipped by and as they crossed
the line the time-clock registered nine-tenth
of a minute for the five miles better than
the record so far and ossie began to see
his hopes realised in a way that would give
him a let-out then from the video screen
close under his face the clock faded and
kramphs face flashed instead in one of the
selective pick-ups which were a feature of
these tiny pieces of equipment

  dont cross me this lime the voice
warned him quietly

  and the menace of the tone was obvious
enough to ossie as the face faded and the
time-clock flashed once more once the selec-
tive message had come through ortford
stole a glance at his brother and signalled
bris received and signalled the agreement

they hugged their positions and the
pace was amazing to the packed stadium
who gasped silently as their heads swung
round as they followed the screeching field
of jet-wheels running a perfect race with
none of them giving the slightest ground
almost as if the ten jets were locked to-
gether they took the corners and ten laps
and half the race was over before there
seemed any change in the order

  once ossie had checked the time and
seen that they were still bettering the track
record with a first half of  minutes he
signalled once more to his partner bris
and they eased the throttles a little wider
in the back straight and by the time they
hit the back corner they were screaming
high above the bunched pack of eight
jockeys who were taken by surprise before
they could get their plan into action the
boys had flashed past them in a flashing
roar of wide-open jets as they ripped
through the straight and into the straight
comer

  angrily the face of kramph slashed the
time-clock from the tiny screen and
kramphs voice purred murderously

  remember ortford dont cross me

  this time ossie snapped a switch as they

screamed through the back straight and he
selected kramph and his voice was reck-
lessly wild as he snapped back his answer
to the man who controlled his fate

  we know what a record-breaking time
means kramph try and stop me now

   fifteen laps were done and the time well
within the record still at  minutes five
laps still remained and through them the
tenseness mounted to a delirium among the
seggies strained forward so as not to miss
a single facet of the stirring race

  among those in the blue arena amsley
castle clenched the numbered discs tightly
and wondered what was to pay determined
to get his money back from the double-
dealing jet-jockeys from austral outback
he had been frequenting the city track and
following the gambling moves of bart stage
whom he knew as kramphs agent

  by careful wagering he had more than
recouped his losses and was now plunging
most of his gains on this one event stage
had placed a large sum on one of the un-
popular jockeys in the event and though
the seggies boldly favored either ossie or
bris amsley noted with a certain assur-
ance that none of kramphs money had
been placed on either of these ace riders

   but now with less than five laps to go
and with the two brothers holding what
seemed to be an unassailable lead amsley
once more began to realise that the austral
outback boys were playing a dangerous
lone hand in this event

fiercely his face livid with emotion
kramph once more flashed his face on
to the video screen before ossie and issued
his warning laughing recklessly keeping
his throttle full open in the seventeenth lap
ossie switched his video in tune with briss
and bris saw and heard what kramph had
to say

  get that seggy over the edge fool
finish him now

  uncertainly bris glanced across at his
brother with a look of disbelief on his face
and ossie signalled back

   speed will do it ill be champion after
this

   kramph will kill us croaked bris ner-
vously

   ill fix that signalled back ossie in the

short code they used for such messages on
the track

  he got lauras tuning on his video and
then he rapped out

   get police protection immediately after
race fear attempt on life

  panicking laura called her brother of
the police and a force was ordered within
a few seconds strato-cars raced protection
to the stadium then one lap yet remained
and suddenly ossie realised that kramph
had fooled them completely the jet was
spluttering wildly as the last of the fuel was
being used in the second comer out of the
straight the jet-wheels would coast the
track past the finishing line but there would
be no possibility of breaking the record
angrily he glanccd back at the pack of
riders flashing closer then he flung his con-
trols over and sent his machine slithering
down the track and bumping into bris

   briss fear-ridden face flashed at him for
a moment as the machines collided and then
they both flashed down from the track to
be caught in the safety netting device with
which the centre of the stadium was fitted

   by them crashed an angry group of eight
jockeys eagerly sorting themselves into a
grouping that would allow the correct num-
ber to win past the post in a howl of angry
and disappointed bawling from the seggies
enclosure like a great force of ants dis-
turbed in their nest they rose and shouted
their disapproval

   one after another they yelled and scream-
ed and swiftly kramph consulted the
judges and the police at last the seggies
had awakened into the solidity of mob
action and they were a tremendous force
that could only be stopped by annihilation
and the police angrily refused to do this
every living-death by the trance guns of the
army would have brought ravagement
among the seggies and spread the seeds of
restlessness and malcontent which the jet-
wheel stadiums had been designed to pre-
vent

  down from the towering height of his
sky-reaching offices the face of the red
tunic no  flashed on to the videos
throughout the stadium and his soft voice
somehow penetrated the violence of sound
and made itself heard

  owing to an oversight two of the jet-

wheels were not correctly supplied with
fuel seeing that this is a breach of rules
the race will be re-run later and all bets will
stand as made

  a tremendous cheer screamed up for
red tunic no  but when later the boys
went on to the track again ossie was soon
aware that the other jockeys were aboard
faster machines

  weve got to fight our way through
he growled at bris

  let them win bris growled

   these jets can still break that record

snarled ossie savagely just let them try
and stop me

   kramph wont stand to see us win spat
bris were through

  im taking that championship and what
joes with it-olgar burst out ossie sud-
denly the highest the most desirable
to the highest thats what im having

por a moment bris stared at his brother
 and then asked

  but marian and  and laura ha
gasped out

  even they can be useful marian for
beauty as a cover in night delight 
laura to vote me a red tunic when im
champion olgar to prove i can have what
other men cannot get

  the fiery venom and yet cold-blooded
way in which ossie rapped out this sum-
mary of that part of his activities in austral
city made his brother draw back and stare
at him in disbelief

   that pep-drink colored female from the
moon bris demanded you wouldnt

  im going to the top snarled ossie
angrily

pag k
thrills incorporated

  lower than a martian mutant bris
snarled slowly

  dirty ungrateful seggy snarled ossie
ferociously watch out or ill play
kramphs game

  better a seggy headed for the decom-
posers than a blue tunic brother to a filthy
thought such as you bris said grimly

  the warning light flashed then and the
jet-wheels flashed away from where they
had been idling on the track by decree
from red tunic no  the re-run was to
be over ten laps instead of twenty and
suddenly ossie cursed when he realised
what that meant there could be no cham-
pionship won in such a race

  recklessly he streaked his machine
through the first three laps well ahead of
bris who was keeping just ahead of the
bunch behind three more laps slipped
by and kramphs face flashed on to the
video of ossies machine

  crash that seggy madman kramph
snarled ill run the championship imme-
diately following for you the red tunic
and a fortune he promised

  with a wild wrench at his tlirottle ossie
jerked his machine back and waited till
bris roared beside him and then his jet-
wheel gathered speed as they swept high
into the following corner higher and
higher up with grim screwed face ossie
forced them in a seemingly uncontrollable
slide and then from the brink of the track
he wrenched his jet-wheel down to safety as
he saw briss shoot over the track into a
wild lunge through air

  laps ceased to have meaning then and
the bunch closed around and he fought them
off with every dirty trick he had learned
from his short and meteoric career to fame
in stadiums

  two would-be wreckers were crashed and
another shot over the track leaving but six
jet-wheels on the course

  lose this you fool kramph ordered
him by video

  ossie laughed he laughed for already
he knew that red tunic no  had ordered
a championship race that afternoon to
pacify the angry seggies who were more
excited than ever now trouble stalked
abroad in austral one as kramph fought

to keep one reckless jet-wheel jockey under
control

  in the final lap ossie broke free and
clear and crossed the line a half-wheel ahead
of his nearest rival automatically he be-
came an entrant in the championship event
such was the decree of red tunic no 
it was seldom that he interfered publicly
but when he did the seggies went home
elated with a feeling of success-a very
harmless feeling

ossie felt sick when he reached the pits
after the re-run event deen into his
mind was inscribed the image of bris shoot-
ing high over the rim of the track and
info space beyond his stomach muscles
contracted in spasms that would have
caused vomiting to his remote and far-dis-
tant ancestors to ortford long fed from
the thin blue hissing tube of the food-ray
these muscular movements caused pain
over and over to himself he kept hissing

   filthy low seggy thats all i protected
and shielded him and what came in return
treachery filthy low seggy

  and even when kramph came snarling
up to him he stared at the man dully with-
out paying much heed and seemed not to
hear the words

  lose the championship or ill person-
ally finish you purred the manager of the
jet-wheel stadium in a screaming whisper

   and then he was gone his rage and hate
boiling into a fearful crescendo of banked
emotion within him

  then close on his heels came amsley
castle and his face was bleak and his eyes
heavy his fortune was gone and he looked
at ossie inanely and grinned slightly

   i made something of you and you ruined
me he said softly

  look pleaded ossie quietly get me
in shape for the championship later and
ill win you back everything youve lost
get me in shape and ill win the jet-wheel
jockey pleaded

   how could i win with every seggie in the
place betting on you how could i win that
way

  listen to them ossie said quickly
pleading theyve seen me they know
im finished theyll wager against me

page 
jet-wheel jockey

get me in shape take my prize-money
from this race and wager it on me for the
championship but get me in shape

  amsley looked at this tall blond fellow
who had been so sure and proud such a
short time before and he laughed why
not so he nodded his head and took ossie
quickly away to a private workout room
and there began to work on him an hour
slipped by before he was satisfied with the
results and then with a last few minutes
under the food-ray tubes amsley was satis-
fied with his jockey

  youll do he growled sullenly ive
brought a jet-wheel from our old head-
quarters and ive wagered every last coin of
money i could raise on you the seggies
think youre through theyre restless and
in a savage mood red tunic no  has
ordered that the winner be conferred with
a red tunic immediately he wins and be-
fore the whole assembled stadium he thinks
that will satisfy them kramph will be in-
vestigated for this day now ive got to
leave you

  ill win ossie said sombrely ill get
to the top nothing will stop me

  and while he relaxed after amsley castle
had gone laura came to the room and he
smiled at her and nodded towards the
divan

  it wont be long now he grinned
quietly ill be wearing a red tunic and
a wig before the afternoon is through

  ive been waiting for that time sighed
laura softly

  ive got to rest he said quietly leave
me now

chuckling to himself at the success
of his efforts in austral city he headed
for the pits as he heard the call for riders
for the last event-the special event-the
championship

  amsley had a special jet-wheel waiting
for him and kramph snarled an angry tirade
at him when ossie had himself strapped
into the saddle of the jet-wheel brought
to the stadium by castle

  the warning light flashed and they went
through the hatches on to the track with the
openings swinging shut behind them six
riders in all and all without partners six

individualists striving for the honor and the
red tunic and the fame and privilege

  as they circled the track for the warm-
ing up ossie was aware of the constant
swelling babble of the seggies as they moved
about restlessly in their special area trouble
was brewing jet-wheeling had brought to
a head the simmering emotions of resent-
ment and anger among the seggies they
were united and voicing their grievances
and red tunic no i was keeping in touch
by video and kramph was crouched snarl-
ing in his place in the stand for he knew
that this was one race he could not rig to
suit himself but he also knew that ortford
wasnt such a fool as to win

  with the go signal flashing the six jet-
wheel aces settled into the turmoil of the
race with all the concentration of a guided
missile following a fore-ordained course
with red tunic no  watching them they
dared not try and follow thc orders of
kramph so each jockey settled down to
ride a race and strive for the coveted award

  with the laps whipping by the seggies
screamed abuse as ossie whom they had
thought exhausted fought his way to the
lead and at fifteen laps he was well clear
angrily the jet-wheel jockey smashed his
small video screen as kramph flashed on
and off in a warning staccato of images

  from the seventeenth lap there was never
doubt and ossie finished lengths ahead of
his nearest rival and then down the long
back straight past the seggies he moved and
he was smiling as he looked them over seg-
gies the fools look at them and then
here he was with thc red tunic as near to
his as it was possible he had climbed-
climbcd to thc top

  then from the massed crowds of red
tunics came one with an outfit to place on
ortford as he waited in the centre of the
arena once it was presented the privilege
and thc class that went with it could never
he taken away from him

  i knew i didnt have to stay down just
because my fool father didnt become im-
munised before he played with atomic jets
he chuckled to himselfas he waited after
having been unstrapped from his jet-wheel

  there is always a way to climb through
the tangles of class he congratulated him-
self f ve got there-to the top

  but while these meanderings and seem-

page 
thrills lncorpokited

ingly vague thoughts were racing through
his head he found laura before him with
the red and she removed his blue tunic
and placed the red upon him the seggies
shrieked with delight having forgotten for
the moment that this jet-wheel jockey had
robbed them of their wages by winning

   then in traditional ritual style laura
stooped and unlaced the blue soft leather
boots from the feet of the new jet-wheel
jockey champion she drew off one of them
and then suddenly drew back with a shriek
of terror immediately video screens tuned
to the scene and on to the tiny portable
screens flashed the startling image of cloven
hooves where feet should have been

  osland ortford had fought his way from
the segregated classes to the very top and
vindicated himself to himself removed the
curse his careless father had thrust upon
him never could the red be taken away
now that it had been given and ortford
laughed as he saw the woman shrink back
away from him in horror

  from the stand high above a snarling
burst of wrath screamed from kramph as
he realised the greatness of the deception
and fraud and used to cheating but
not being cheated he suddenly leapt up
and snatched his trance-gun from its hidden
place he fired the blast from the gun
before the nearest police officer could wrest
it from him

  the aim was true and osland ortford
was suddenly transformed from that ani-
mated and triumphant seggy who had fought
his way cheated his way to the very top
and instead the dreadful effects of the
trance-ray settled over the features of the
man he was suddenly transformed into
a creature in a state of suspended animation
from which no scientist had been able to
revive a victim of the trance-gun

   at the sight of this sudden defeat of what
for them was a supreme triumph the seg-
gies were turned in the moment into a
howling screaming mob of diabolically in-
tentioned fiends they smashed their way
from their special enclosure and raced to-
ward the area set aside for the red tunics

   there half chanting half shouting they
committed a carnage that was later buried
beneath the blast of the argon bomb which
red tunic ordered to be dropped over the

arena as a final resort when all else had
failed and it seemed that the mounting tide
of rebellious seggies would hood further
alield into the surrounding country up-
setting the well-defined social structure on
which he believed the life of austral one
depended 

on a public articulated strato-car a pale-
faced bris smiled weakly as he lay
back in his radia-splint    there would be
many painful weeks absorbing the life
nurturing radiaton they had even offered
to do something about those second joints
but the shudder that had gone through his
tortured frame had been eloquently final

    the video reporter fidgetted impatiently
as the bleak look returned to the young
mans eyes   

   so ossie stopped a trance  his voice
was flat dead it certainly was a triumph
 a triumph for our system that a seggy
could finally win the red  a triumph 

   a few minutes later his video comment
was flashing to the entire asteroid system
but there was no hardness in his eyes now
as he watched with the dark-haired girl by
his side   

   it wont be a red card marian  you
know that

   i know  but i read a quotation from
the ancients once    they had a phrase all
those thousands of years ago true blue
they said  bris do you think they knew
about people like us even then
