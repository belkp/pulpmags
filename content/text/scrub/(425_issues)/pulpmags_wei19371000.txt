iger cat

by david h keller

a grim tale of torture and the blind men who were chained to
pillars in an underground cave

the man tried his best to sell me
the house he was confident that
i would like it repeatedly he
called my attention to the view

  there was something in what he said
about the view the villa on the top of a
mountain commanded a vision of the
valley vine-clad and cottage-studded it
was an irregular bowl of green dotted
with stone houses which were white-
washed to almost painful brilliancy

  the valley was three and a third miles
at its greatest width standing at the
front door of the house an expert marks-
man with telescopic sight could have
placed a rifle bullet in each of the white
marks of cottages they nestled like
little pearls amid a sea of green grape-
vines

  a wonderful view signor the real-
estate agent repeated that scene at
any time of the year is worth twice what
i am asking for the villa

  but i can see all this without buy-
ing i argued

  not without trespassing

  but the place is old it has no run-
ning water

  wrong and he smiled expansively
showing a row of gold-filled teeth
listen

  we were silent

  there came to us the sound of bubbling
water turning i traced the sound i
found a marble cupid spurting water in
a most peculiar way into a wall basin

i smiled and commented

  there is one like that in brussels and
    

another in madrid but this is very fine
however i referred to running water in
a modern badiroom

   but why batiie when you can sit here
and enjoy the view

  he was impossible so i wrote a
check took his bill of sale and became
the owner of a mountain topped by a
stone house that seemed to be half ruin
but he did not know and i did not tell
him that i considered the fountain alone
worth the price that i had paid in fact
i had come to italy to buy that fountain
if i could buy it and take it back to
america with me i knew all about that
curious piece of marble george sea-
brook had written to me about it just
one letter and then he had gone on
goodness knows where george was like
that always on the move now i owned
the fountain and was already planning
where i should place it in my new york
home certainly not in the rose garden

  i sat down on a marble bench and
looked down on die valley the real-
estate man was right it was a delicate
delicious piece of scenery the surround-
ing mountains were high enough to
throw a constant shadow on some part
of the valley except at high noon there
was no sign of life but i was sure that
the vineyards were alive with husband-
men and their families an eagle floated
serenely on the upper air currents auto-
matically adjusting himself to their con-
stant changing

   stretching myself i gave one look at
my car and then walked into the house
tiger cat



 in the kitchen two peasants sat an old
 man and an old woman they rose as
 i entered

  who are you i asked in english

  they simply smiled and waved their
 hands i repeated my question in italian

  we serve the man replied

  serve whom

  whoever is the master

  have you been here long

  we have always been here it is our
 home

  his statement amused me and i com-
 mented the masters come and go but
 you remain

  it seems so

  many masters

  alas yes they come and-go nice
young men like you but they do not
stay they buy and look at the view and
cat with us a few days and then they are
gone

   and then the villa is sold again

  the man shrugged how should we
know we simply serve

  then prepare me my dinner and
serve it outside under the grapevine
where i can see the view

  the woman started to obey the man
came nearer

looking eternally into the blackness of his life
and chained to a pillar of stone


weird tales

  shall i carry your bags to the bed-
room

  yes and i will go with you and
unpack

  he took me to a room on the second
floor there was a bed there and a very
old chest of drawers the floor every-
thing about the room was spotlessly clean
the walls had been freshly whitewashed
their smooth whiteness suggested won-
derful possibilities for despoliation the
drawing of a picture the writing of a
poem the careless writhing autograph
that caused my relatives so much despair

  have all the masters slept here-i
asked carelessly

  ah

  was there one by the name of george
seabrook

  i think so but they come and go 
i am old and forget

  and all these masters none of them
ever wrote on the walls

  of a certainty all wrote with pencil
what they desired to write who should
say they should not for did not the villa
belong to them while they were here
but always we prepared for the new
master and made the walls clean and
beautiful again

  you were always sure that there
would be a new master

  certainly someone must pay us our
wages

  i gravely placed a gold piece in his
itching palm asking what did they
write on the walls

  he looked at me with old unblinking
eyes owl eyes that is what they were
and he slowly said

  each wrote or drew as his fancy led
him for they were the masters and could
do as they wished

  but what were the words

i cannot speak english or read it
evidently the man was not going to
talk to me the entire situation was most

interesting same servants same villa
many masters they came and bought
and wrote on the wall and left and then
my real-estate friend sold the house
again a fine racket

  downstairs outdoors under the grape-
vine eating a good italian meal looking
at the wonderful view i came to laugh at
my suspicions i ate spaghetti olives
dark bread and wine silence hung heav-
ily over the sullen sleepy afternoon the
sky became copper-colored it was about
to rain the old man came and showed
me a place to put my car a recess in the
wall of the house open at one end but
sheltered from the weather the stone
floor was black with grease more than
one automobile had been kept there

  other cars have been here i ven-
tured

  all the masters had cars the old man
replied

back on the stone gallery i waited for
the storm to break at last it came in
a solid wall of gray wetness across the
valley nearer and nearer it came till it
deluged my villa and drove me inside

  the woman was lighting candles i
took one from her hand

  i want to look through the house i
explained

  she made no protest so i started ex-
ploring the first floor one room was
evidently the sleeping-quarters- for the
servants another was the kitchen and
the remaining two might have served in
the olds days for dining-room and draw-
ing-room there was little furniture and
the walls were gray with time and mold
one flight of stone stairs led upward to
the bedroom another to the cellar i
decided to go downstairs

  the were steps not made of masonry
but apparently carved out of the living
rock the cellar was simply a cubical
hole in the mountain it all looked very
tiger cat



old i had the uneasy feeling that orig-
inal y that cellar had been a tomb and
that later the house had been built over
it but once at the bottom there was
nothing to indicate a sepulcher a few
small casks of wine some junk odds of
rope and rusty iron those were in the
corners otherwise the room was empty
and dusty

  it is an odd room i commented to
myself it seemed in some way out of
place and out of shape and size for the
villa above it i had expected something
more something larger gloomier walk-
ing around i examined the walls and
then something came to my alert senses

  three sides of the room were carved
out of rock but the remaining side was
of masonry and in that side there was a
door a door and why should a door
be there except to lead to another room
there was a door and that presupposed
something on the other side and what
a door it was more of a barricade dian
a partition the iron hinges were built
to support weight and give complete de-
fense and support there was a keyhole
and if the key corresponded with the size
of the hole it was the largest that i
had ever heard of

  naturally i wanted to open the door
as master of the villa i had a right to
upstairs the old woman seemed unable
to understand me and ended by telling me
to see her husband he in turn seemed
incapable of following my stream of talk
at last i took him to the door and
pointed to the keyhole in english ital-
ian and sign language i told him rather
emphatically that i wanted the key to
that door at last he was willing to admit
that he understood my questions he
shook his head he had never had the
key to that door yes he knew that there
was such a door but he had never been
on the other side it was very old per-
haps his ancestors understood about it

but they were all dead lie made me
tired so much so that i rested by placing
a hand on the butt of the upper hinge i
knew that he was deceiving -me lived
there all his life and never saw the door
open

  and you have no key to that door
i repeated

  no i have no key

  who has the key

  the owner of the house

  but i own it

  yes you are the master but i mean
the one who owns it all the time

  so the various masters do not really
buy the place

  they buy it but they come and go
but the owner keeps on selling it and
owning it

  yes

  must be a profitable business and
who owns it

  donna marchesi

   think i met her yesterday in
sorona

   yes that is where she lives

  the storm had passed sorona was
only two miles away on the other side of
the mountain the cellar the door the
mysterious uncertainty on the other side
intrigued me i told the man that i would
be back by supper and i went to my bed-
room to change preparatory to making an
afternoon call

  in the room i found my hand black
with oil

  and that told me a good many things
as it was the hand that had rested against
the upper hinge of the door i washed
the hand changed my clothes and drove
my car to sorona

fortunately the donna marchesi
was at home i might have met her
before but i now saw her ethereal beauty
for the first time a least it seemed
ethereal at the first moment in some


weird tales

ways she was the most beautiful woman
that i had ever seen skin white as milk
hair a tawny red piled in great masses
on her head and eyes of a peculiar
green with pupils that were slots instead
of circles she wore her nails long and
they were tinted red to match the titian
of her hair she seemed surprized to have
me call on her and more surprized to
hear of my errand

you bought the villa she asked
yes though when i bought it i
did not know that you were the owrner
the agent never stated whom he was
acting for

  i know she said with a smile
franco is peculiar that way he always
pretends that he owns the place

  no doubt he has used it more than
once

  i fear so the place seems to be un-
fortunate i sell it with a reserve clause
the owner must live there and no one
seems to want to stay so the place reverts
back to me

  it seems to be an old place

  very old it has been in my family
for generations i have tried to get rid of
it but what can i do when the young
men will not stay

  she shrugged her shoulders expressive-
ly i countered with

  perhaps if they knew as i do that
you owned the property they would be
content to stay for ever in sorona
prettily said she answered then
the room became silent and i heard her
heavy breathing like the deep purr of
a cat

  they come and go she said at last
and when they go you sell to an-
other i asked

  naturally and with the hope that
one will stay

  i have come for the key i said
bluntly the key to the cellar door

  are you sure you want it

  absolutely it is my villa and my cel-
lar and my door i want the key i want
to see what is on the other side of the
door

  and then it was that i saw the pupils
of her eyes narrow to livid slits she
looked at me for a second for five and
then opening a drawer in a cabinet near
her chair she took out the key and
handed it to me it was a tool worthy of
the door that it was supposed to open
being fully eight inches long and a pound
in weight

  taking it i thanked her and said good-
bye fifteen minutes later i was back
profuse in my apologies i was tempera-
mental i explained and i frequently
changed my mind whatever was on the
other side of the door could stay there as
far as i was concerned then again i
kissed her hand farewell

  on the side street i passed through
the door of a locksmidi and waited while
he completed a key he was following a
wax impression of the original key an
hour later i was on the way back to the
villa with the key in my pocket a key
that i was sure would unlock the door
and i was confident that the lady with
the cat eyes felt sure that i had lost
all interest in that door and what was
beyond it

  the full moon was just appearing over
the mountains when i drove my car up to
the villa i was tired but happy taking
the candlestick in my hand which candle-
stick was handed to me with a deep bow
by the old woman i ascended the stairs
to my bedroom and soon i was fast
asleep

i awoke with a start the moon was
still shining it was midnight i
heard or thought i heard a deep moan-
ing it sounded a little like waves beat-
ing on a rockbound coast then it ceased
and w-as replaced by a musical element
tiger cat



that came in certain stately measures
those sounds were in the room but they
came from far away only by straining my
sense of sound to the utmost could i hear
anything

  slippers on my feet flashlight in my
hand and the key in the pocket of my
dressing-gown i slowly descended the
stairs loud snores from the servants
room told or seemed to tell of their deep
slumbers down into the cellar i went
and put the key into the hole of the lock
the key turned easily-no rust there-
the springs and the tumblers had been
well oiled like the hinges it was evi-
dent that the door had been used often
turning the light on the hinges i saw
what had made my hand black with oil
earnestly i damned the servants they
knew about the door they knew what
was on the other side

  just as i was about to open the door i
heard a womans voice singing in italian
it sounded like a selection from an opera
it was followed by applause and then a
moaning and one shrill cry as though
someone had been hurt there was no
doubt now as to where the sounds that i
heard in my room had come from they
had come from the other side of the door
there was a mystery there for me to solve
but i was not ready to solve it so i
turned the key noiselessly and with the
door locked tiptoed back to my bed

  there i tried to put two and two to-
gether they made five seven a million
vague admixtures of impossible results
all filled with weird forebodings but
never did they make four and till they
did i knew the answers to be wrong for
two and two had to make four

  many changes of masters one after
another they came and bought and dis-
appeared a whitewashed wall what
secrets were covered with that white-
wash a door in a cellar and what
deviltry went on behind it a key and

a well-oiled lock and servants that knew
everything in vain the question came
to me what is back of the door there
was no ready answer but donna mar-
chesi knew was it her voice that i had
heard she knew almost everything about
it but there was one thing that i knew
and she did not she did not know that
i could pass through the door and find
out what was on the other side she did
not know that i had a key

  the next day i pleaded indisposition
and spent most of the hours idling and
drowsing in my chamber not till nearly
midnight did i venture down the serv-
ants were certainly asleep that time a
dose of chloral in their wine had attended
to the certainty of their slumbers fully
dressed with an automatic in my pocket
i reached the cellar and opened the door
it swung noiselessly on its well-greased
hinges the darkness on the other side
was the blackness of hell an indescrib-
able odor came to me a prison smell and
with it the soft half sob half laugh of
sleeping children dreaming in their sleep
and not happy

  i flashed the light around the room it
was not a room but a cavern a cave that
extended far into the distance the roof
supported by stone pillars set at regular
intervals as far as my light would
carry i saw the long rows of white
columns

  and to each pillar was bound a man
by chains they were resting on the
stone floor twenty or more of them and
all asleep snores grunts and weary
sighs came from them but not a single
eyelid opened even when i flashed the
light in their faces their eyes were shut

  and those faces sickened me white
and drawn and filled with the lines of
deep suffering all were covered with
scars long narrow deep scars some
fresh and red others old and dead-white
at last the sunken eyelids and the inabil-


weird tales

ity to see my flashlight and respond told
me the nauseating truth those men
were all blind

  a pleasant sight one blind man
looking eternally into the blackness of his
life and chained to a pillar of stone-
that was bad enough but multiply that
by twenty was it worse could it be
worse could twenty men suffer more
than one man and then a thought came
to me a terrible impossible thought so
horrible that i doubted my logic but
now two and two were beginning to make
four could those men be the masters
they came and bought and left-to go
to the cellar and stay there

  oh donna marchesi i whispered
how about those cat-eyes if you had
a hand in this you are not a woman you
are a tiger

i thought that i understood part of it
the latest master came to her for the
key to the cellar and then when he once
passed through the door he never left
she and her servants were not there to
welcome me that night because she did
not koow that i had a key

  the thought came to me that perhaps
one of those sleeping men was george
seabrook he and i used to play tennis
together and we knew each other like
brothers he had a large scar on the back
of his right hand a livid star-shaped
scar with that in mind i walked care-
fully from sleeping man to sleeping man
looking at their right hands and i
found a right hand with a scar that was
shaped like the one i knew so well but
that blind man only a skin-covered
skeleton chained to a bed of stone that
could not be my gay young tennis player
george

  the discovery nauseated me what did
it mean what could it mean if the
donna marchesi was back of all that
misery what was her motive

  down the long cave-like room i went
there seemed to be no end to it though
many of the columns were surrounded
with empty chains only those near the
door had their human flies in the trap
in the opposite direction the rows of pil-
lars strctched into a far oblivion i
thought that at the end there was the
black mouth of a tunnel but i could
not be sure and dared not go that far to
explore the truth then out of that tun-
nel i heard a voice come a singing voice
slipping my shoes off i ran back near the
door and hid as best i could in a dark
recess back of a far piece of stone i
stood there in the darkness my torch out
the handle of the revolver in my hand

  the singing grew louder and louder
and then the singer came into view it
was none other than donna marchesi
she carried a lantern in one hand and a
basket in the other hanging the lantern
on a nail she took the basket and went
from one sleeping man to another with
each her performance was the same she
awakened them with a kick in the face
and then when they sat up crying with
pain she placed a hard roll of bread in
their blind trembling outstretched hand
with all fed there was silence save for
gnawing teeth breaking through the hard
crusts the poor devils were hungry
starving slowly to death and how they
wolfed the bread she laughed with
animal delight as they cried for more
standing under the lamp a lovely devil
in her decollete dress she laughed at
them i swear i saw her yellow eyes
dilated in the semi-darkness

  suddenly she gave the command

  up you dogs up

like well-trained animals they rose to

j their feet clumsily but as fast as they
could under the handicap of trembling
limbs and heavy chains two were slow
in obeying and those she struck across
tiger cat



the face with a small whip till they
whined with pain

   they stood there in silence twenty odd
blind men chained against as many pil-
lars of stone and then the woman stand-
ing in the middle of them started to sing
it was a well-trained voice but metallic
and her high notes had in them the cry
of a wild animal no feminine softness
there she sang from an italian opera
and i knew that i had heard that song
before while she sang her audience
waited silently at last she finished and
they started to applaud shrunken hands
beat noisily against shrunken hands

  she seemed to watch them carefully as
though she were measuring the degree of
their appreciation one man did not sat-
isfy her she went over and dug into
his face with long strokes of those long
red nails until his face was red and her
fingers bloody and when she finished
her second song that man clapped louder
than any of them he had learned his
lesson

  she ended by giving them each another
roll and a dipper of water then lantern
and basket in her hands she walked away
and disappeared down the tunnel the
blind men crying and cursing in their
impotent rage sank down on their stone
beds

   i went to my friend and took his hand

  george george seabrook i whis-
pered

  he sat up and cried who calls me
who is there

  i told him and he started to cry at
last he became quiet enough to talk to me
what he told me with slight variants
was the story of all the men there and
all the men who had been there but who
had died each man had been master for
a day or a week each had found the
cellar door and had come to the donna
marchesi for the key some had been
suspicious and had written their thoughts

on the wall of their bedroom but one
and all had in the end found their
curiosity more than they could resist and
had opened the door on the other side
they had been overpowered and chained
to a pillar and there they had remained
till they died some of them lived longer
than the rest smith of boston had been
there over two years though he was
coughing badly and did not think that he
could last much longer seabrook told
me their names they were the best blood
of america with three englishmen and
one frenchman

  and are you all blind i whispered
dreading the answer

  yes that happens the first night we
are here she does it with her nails
and she comes every night

  every night she feeds us and sings
to us and we applaud when one of us
dies she unchains the body and throws
it down a hole somewhere she talks to
us about that hole sometimes and brags
that she is going to fill it up before she
stops

  but who is helping her

  i think it is the real-estate man of
course the old devils upstairs help i
think that they must drug us some of
the men say that they went to sleep in
their beds and woke chained to their
posts

  my voice trembled as i bent over and
whispered in his ear what would you
do george if she came and sang and you
found that you were not chained you
and the other men not chained what
would you men do george

  ask them he snarled ask them
one at a time but i know what i would
do i know

  and he started to cry because he could
not do it the next second cried from
rage and helplessness till the tears ran
from his empty sockets


weird tales

  does she always come at the same
time

  as far as i know but time is noth-
ing to us we just wait for death

  are the chains locked

  yes and she must have the key but
we could file the links if only we had files
if only each of us had a file we could get
free perhaps the man upstairs has a key
but i hardly think so

  did you write on that pretty wall up-
stairs the whitewashed wall

  i did i think we all did one man
wrote a sonnet to the woman verses in
her honor telling about her beautiful
eyes he raved about that poem for
hours while he was dying did you ever
see it on the wall

  i did not see it the old people
whitewash the walls before each new
master comes

  i thought so

  are you sure you would know what
to do george if she sang to you and
you were loose

  yes we would know

  so i left him promising an end to the
matter as soon as i could arrange it

the next day saw me calling on the
donna marchesi i took her flowers
that time a corsage of vivid purple and
scarlet orchids she entertained me in her
music room and i taking the hint asked
her to sing shyly almost with reluctance
she did as i asked she sang the selec-
tion from the italian opera that i knew
so well i was generous in my applause
she smiled

  you like to hear me sing

  indeed i want to hear you again i
could hear you daily without growing
tired

  youre nice she purred perhaps it
could be arranged

  you are too modest you have a won-

derful voice why not give it to the
wrorld

  i sang once in public she sighed
it was in new york at a -private
musical there were many men there
perhaps it was stage fright my voice
broke badly and the audience especially
the men were not kind i am not sure
but i thought that i heard some of them
hiss me

   surely not i protested

  indeed so but no man has hissed
my singing since then

  i hope not i replied indignantly
you have a wonderful voice and when
i applauded you i was sincere by the
wray may i change my mind and ask for
the key to the door in the cellar

  do you want it really want it my
friend

  i am sure i do i may never use it
but it will please me to have it little
things in life make me happy and this
key is a little thing

  then you shall have it will you do
me a favor wait till sunday to use it
today is friday and you will not have
to wait many hours

  it will be a pleasure to do as you
desire i replied kissing her hand
and shall i hear you sing again may
i come often to hear you sing

  i promise you that she sighed i
am sure that you will hear me sing often
in the future i feel that in some way
our fates approach the same star

   i looked into her eyes her yellow cat-
eyes and i was sure that she spoke the
truth destiny had certainly brought me
to find her in sorona

i bought two dozen rat-tailed files
and dashed across the mountains to
milan there i was closeted with the con-
suls of three nations england france
and my own they did not want to be-
lieve my story i gave them names and
tiger cat



they had to admit that there had been
inquiries but they felt that the main
details were nightmares resulting from
an over-use of italian wines but i in-
sisted that i was not drunk with new
wine at last they called in the chief of
the detective bureau he knew franco
the real-estate agent also the lady in
question and he had heard something
of the villa not much but vague whis-
perings

  we will be there saturday night he
promised that leaves you tonight the
lady will not try to trap you till sunday
can you attend to the old people

  they will be harmless see that
franco does not have a chance to escape
here is the extra key to the door i will
go through before twelve when i am
ready i will open the door if i am not
out by one in die morning you come
through with your police do we all
understand

  i understand said the american con-
sul but i still think you are dream-
ing-

  back at the villa i again drugged the
old people not much but enough to
insure their sleep that night they liked
me i was liberal with my gold and i
carelessly showed them where i kept my
reserve

  then i went through the door again
i heard the donna marchesi sing to an
audience that would never hiss her she
left and i started to distribute the files
from one blind wretch to the next i
went whispering words of cheer and in-
struction for the next night they were
to cut through a link in the chain but
in such a way that the tiger cat would
not suspect that they had gained their
liberty were they pleased to have a
hope of freedom i am not sure but
they were delighted at another prospect

  the next night i doubled the tips to

the old servants with tears of gratitude
in their eyes they thanked me as they
called me their dear master i put them to
sleep as though they were babies in fact
i wondered at the time if they would ever
recover from the dose of chloral i gave
them i did not even bother to tie them
but just tossed them on their beds

  at half past ten automobiles began to
arrive with darkened lights we had a
lengthy conference and soon after eleven
i went through the door i lost no time
in making sure that each of the blind
mice was a free man but i insisted that
they act as though bound till the proper
time they were trembling but it was
not from fear not that time

  back in my hiding-place i waited and
soon i heard the singing voice ten
minutes later the donna marchesi had
her lantern hung on the nail ah she
was more beautiful that night than i had
ever seen her dressed in filmy white
her beautiful body lovely hair long lithe
limbs would have bound any man to her
through eternity she seemed to sense
that beauty for after giving out the first
supply of rolls she varied her program
she told her audience how she had
dressed that evening for their special
pleasure she described her jewels and
her costume she almost became grand-
iose as she told of her beauty and driv-
ing in the dagger she twisted it as she
reminded them that never would they be
able to see her never touch her or kiss
her hand all they could do was to hear
her sing applaud and at last die

  of all the terrible things in her life
that little talk to those blind men wfas
the climax

  and then she sang i watched her
closely and i saw what i suspected she
sang with her eyes closed was she in
fancy seeming that she was in an opera-
house before thousands of spellbound ad-
mirers who knows but ever as she


weird tales

sang that night her eyes were closed and
even as she came to a close waiting for
the usual applause her eyes were closed

she waited in the silence for the clap
of hands it did not come with
terrific anger she whirled to her basket
and readied for her whip

  dogs she cried have you so soon
forgot your lesson

  and then she realized that the twenty
blind men were closing in on her they
were silent but their outstretched hands
were feeling for something that they
wanted very much even when her whip
started to cut they were silent then
one man touched her to her credit
there was no sign of fear she knew
what had happened she must have
known but she was not afraid her
single scream was nothing but the battle-
cry of the tiger cat going into action

  there was a single cry and that was
all the men reached for what they
wanted in silence for a while they
were all in a struggling group on their
feet but soon they were all on the
ground it was simply a mass and under
that mass was a biting scratching fight-
ing dying animal

  i couldnt stand it i had planned it

all i wanted it all to happen but when
it came i just couldnt stand it covered
with the sweat of fear i ran to the door
and unlocked it i swung it open went
through the doorway closed it and locked
it again the men waiting for me in the
cellar looked on with doubt it seemed
that they were right in thinking that my
tale was an alcoholic one

  give me whisky i gasped as i
dropped on the floor

  in a few minutes i had recovered

  open the door i ordered and
bring the blind men out

  one at a time they were brought to
the kitchen and identified some were
terribly mutilated in the face long deep
scratches and even pieces bitten out and
one had the corner of his mouth torn
most of them were sobbing hysterically
but in some way though none said so
i judged that they were all happy

  we went back to the cellar and through
the door on the stone floor was a clotted
mass of red and white

  whats that asked the american
consul

  i think that is the donna marchesi
i replied she must have met with an
accident
good-bye for eternity we heard her sob

weird tales

pastry cooks set up their booths corbleu
it takes the strength of character not to
stop and buy those cakes of so mudi
taste and fancy the napoleons they are
crisp and fragile as a coquettes promise
the eclairs filled with cool sweet cream
the cream-puffs all aglow with cherries
just to see them is to love life better

they-

  the shrilling of the door-bell startled
me the pressure on the button must
have been that of one who leant against
it doctor trowbridge i must see him
right away a womans voice demanded
as nora mcginnis my household fac-
totum grudgingly responded to the hail

  th docthors offiss hours is over
maam nora answered frigidly haf
past nine ter eleven in th marnin an
two ter four in th afthernoon is when
he sees his patients if its an urgent case
ye have theres lots o good young doc-
thors in th neighborhood but docthor

trowbridge-

  is he here the visitor demanded
sharply

  he is an hes afther digestin his
dinner-an an illigant dinner it wuz
though i do say so as shouldnt-an he

cant be disturbed-

  hell see me all right tell him its
nella bentley and ive got to talk to
him

  de grandin raised an eyebrow elo-
quently the fish at the aquarium have
greater privacy than we my friend he
murmured but broke off as the visitor
came clacking down the hall on high
french heels and rushed into the study
half a dozen paces in advance of my
thoroughly disapproving and more than
semi-scandalized nora

  doctor trowbridge wont you help
me cried the girl as she fairly leaped
across the study and flung her arms about
my shoulders i cant tell dad or
mother they wouldnt understand so

youre the only one-oh excuse me i
thought you were alone her face went
crimson as she saw de grandin standing
by the fire

  its quite all right my dear i
soothed freeing myself from her almost
hysterical clutch this is doctor de
grandin with whom ive been associated
many times id be glad to have the ben-
efit of his advice if you dont mind

  she gave him her hand and a wan
smile as i performed the introduction but
her eyes warmed quickly as he raised her
fingers to his lips with a soft enchante
mademoiselle women animals and
children took instinctively to jules de
grandin

  nella dropped her coat of silky shaven
lamb and sank down on the study couch
her slim young figure molded in her
knitted dress of coral rayon as revealingly
as though she had been cased in plastic
cellulose she has long violet eyes and
a long mouth smooth dark hair parted in
the middle a small straight nose and a
small pointed chin every line of her
is long but definitely feminine breasts
and hips and throat and legs all deli-
cately curved without a hint of angu-
larity

  ive come to see you about ned she
volunteered as de grandin lit her cig-
arette and she sent a nervous smoke-
stream gushing from between red trem-
bling lips he-hes trying to run out
on me

  you mean ned minton i asked
wondering what a middle-aged physician
could prescribe for wandering romeos

  i certainly do mean ned minton she
replied and i mean business too the
darn romantic fool

  de grandins slender brows arched up-
ward till they nearly met the beige-blond
hair that slanted sleekly backward from
his forehead pardonnez-moi he mur-
mured did i understand correctly
pledged to the dead



mademoiselle your amoureux-how do
you say him-sweetheart-has shown
a disposition toward unfaithfulness yet
you accuse him of romanticism

   hes not unfaithful thats the worst
of it hes faithful as tristan and the
chevalier bayard lumped together sans
peur et sans reproche you know says we

cant get married cause-

   just a moment dear i interrupted
as i felt my indignation mounting dye
mean the miserable young puppy cheated
and now wants to weldi-

her blue eyes widened then the little
laughter-wrinkles formed around
them you dear old mid-victorian
she broke in no he aint done wrong
by our nell and im not asking you to
take your shotgun down and force him
to make me an honest woman suppose
we start at the beginning then well get
things straight

   you assisted at both our debuts ive
been told youve known ned and me
since we were a second old apiece havent
you

   i nodded

  know weve always been crazy about
each other too in grammar school high
school and college dont you

   yes i agreed

  all right weve been engaged ever
since our freshman year at beaver ned
just had his frat pin long enough to pin
it on my shoulder-strap at the first fresh-
man dance everything was set for us to
stand up in the diancel and say i do
this june then neds company sent him
to new orleans last december she
paused drew deeply at her cigarette
crushed its fire out in an ash-tray and
set a fresh one glowing

  that started it while he was down
there it seemed that he got playful mixed
up with some glamorous creole gal
once more she lapsed into silence and i

could see the heartbreak showing through
the armor of her flippant manner

  you mean he fell in love-

   i certainly do not if hd had id
have handed back his ring and said
bless you me children even if i had
to bite my heart in two to do it but this
is no case of a new love crowding out the
old ned still loves me never stopped
loving me thats what makes it all seem
crazy as a hashish-eaters dream he was
on the loose in new orleans doing the
town with a crowd of local boys and
probbly had too many ramos fizzes
then he barged into this creole dames

place and- she broke off with a

gallant effort at a smile i guess young
fellows arent so different nowadays than
they were when you were growing up sir
only today we dont believe in sprinkling
perfume in the family cesspool ned
cheated thats the bald truth of it he
didnt stop loving me and he hasnt
stopped now but i wasnt there and that
other girl was and there were no con-
ventions to be recognized now hes
fairly melting with remorse says hes not
worthy of me-wants tc break off our en-
gagement while he spends a lifetime do-
ing penance for a moments folly

   but good heavens i expostulated

if youre willing to forgive-

   youre telling me she answered bit-
terly weve been over it a hundred
times this isnt  even nice girls
know the facts of life today and while
im no more anxious than the next one
to put through a deal in shopworn goods
i still love ned and i cont intend to let
a single indiscretion rob us of our happi-
ness i- the hard exterior veneer of

modernism melted from her like an
autumn ice-glaze melting in the wrarm
october sun and the tears coursed down
her cheeks cutting little valleys in her
carefully-applied make-up hes my
man doctor she sobbed bitterly ive


weird tales

loved him since we made mud-pies to-
gether im hungry thirsty for him hes
everything to me and if he follows out
this fool renunciation he seems set on
itll kill me

  de grandin tweaked a waxed mus-
tache-end thoughtfully you exemplify
the practicality of woman mademoiselle
i applaud your sound hard common
sense he told her bring this silly
young romantic foolish one to me i will

tell him-

  but he wont come i interrupted
i know these hard-minded young
asses when a lad is set on being

stubborn-

  will you go to work on him if i can
get him here interjected nella

  of a certitude mademoiselle 

  you wont think me forward or un-
maidenly

  this is a medical consultation
mademoiselle

  all right be in the office this time
tomorrow night ill have my wandering
boy friend here if i have to bring him in
an ambulance

her performance matched her promise
almost too closely for our comfort
we had just finished dinner next night
when the frenzied shriek of tortured
brakes followed by a crash and the tin-
kling spatter of smashed glass sounded
in the street before the house and in a
moment feet dragged heavily across the
porch we were at the door before the
bell could buzz and in the disk of bright-
ness sent down by the porch light saw
nella bent half double stumbling for-
ward with a mans arm draped across her
shoulders his feet scuffed blindly on the
boards as though they had forgot the
trick of walking or as if all strength had
left his knees his head hung forward
lolling drunkenly a spate of blood ran
down his face and smeared his collar

  good lord i gasped what-

  get him in the surgery-quick the
girl commanded in a whisper im afraid
i rather overdid it

  examination showed the cut across
neds forehead was more bloody than
extensive while the scalp-wound which
plowed backward from his hairline
needed but a few quick stitches

  nella whispered to us as we worked
i got him to go riding with me in my
runabout just as we got here i let out
a scream and swung the wheel hard over
to the right i was braced for it but ned
was unprepared and went right through
the windshield when i ran the car into the
curb lord i thought id killed him when
i saw the blood-you do think hell come
through all right dont you doctor
no thanks to you if he does you
little ninny i retorted angrily you
might have cut his jugular with your con-
founded foolishness if-

  s-s-sb hes coming out of it she
warned start talking to him like a
dutch uncle ill be waiting in the study
if you want me and with a tattoo of
high heels she left us with our patient

  nella is she all right ned cried
as he half roused from the surgery table

we had an accident-

  but certainly monsieur  de grandin
soothed you were driving past our
house when a child ran out before your
car and mademoiselle was forced to
swerve aside to keep from hitting it you
were cut about the face but she escaped
all injur here-he raised a glass of
brandy to the patients lips-drink this
ah so that is better nest-ce-pas

  for a moment he regarded ned in
silence then abruptly you are distrait
monsieur when we brought you in we
were forced to give you a small whiff of
ether while we patched your cuts and in

your delirium you said-

  the color which had come into neds

                     w t-
pledged to the dead



checks as the fiery cognac warmed his
veins drained out again leaving him
as ghastly as a corpse did nella
hear me he asked hoarsely did i
blab-

  compose yourself monsieur de
grandin bade she heard nothing but
it would be well if we heard more i
think i understand your difficulty i am a
physician and a frenchman and no prude
this renunciation whidi you make is but
the noble gesture you have been unfor-
tunate and now you fear have courage
no infection is so bad there is no rem-
edy-

  neds laugh was hard and brittle as
the tinkle of a breaking glass i only
wish it were the thing you think he in-
terrupted id have you give me salvar-
san and see what happened but there
isnt any treatment i can take for this im
not delirious and im not crazy gentle-
men i know just what im saying insane
as it may sound im pledged to the dead
and there isnt any way to bail me out

  eh what is it you say de grandins
small blue eyes were gleaming with the
light of battle as he caught the occult im-
plication in neds declaration pledged
to the dead comment cela

ned raised himself unsteadily and
balanced on the table edge

  it happened in new orleans last win-
ter he answered id finished up my
business and was on the loose and
thought id walk alone through the
vieux carre-the old french quarter
id had dinner at antoines and stopped
around at the old absinthe house for
a few drinks then strolled down to the
french market for a cup of chicory coffee
and some doughnuts finally i walked
down royal street to look at madame la-
lauries old mansion thats the famous
haunted house you know i wanted to
w t-

see if i could find a ghost good lord
i wanted to

  the moon was full that night but
the house was still as old saint denis
cemetery so after peering through the
iron grilles that shut the courtyard from
the street for half an hour or so i started
back toward canal street

  id almost readied bienville street
when just as i passed one of those funny
two-storied iron-grilled balconies so many
of the old houses have i heard some-
thing drop on the sidewalk at my feet
it was a japonica one of those rose-like
flowers they grow in the courtyard gar-
dens down there when i looked up a
girl was laughing at me from the second
story of the balcony mon fleuron mon-
sieur sil vous plait she called stretch-
ing down a white arm for the bloom

  the moonlight hung about her like
a veil of silver tissue and i could see her
plainly as though it had been noon most
new orleans girls are dark she was
fair her hair was very fine and silky and
about the color of a frosted chestnut-burr
she wore it in a long bob with curls
around her face and neck and i knew

weird tales

without being told that those ringlets
werent put in with a hot iron her face
was pale colorless and fine-textured as a
magnolia petal but her lips were brilliant
crimson there was something remin-
iscent of those ladies you see pictured in
directoire prints about her small regu-
lar features straight white high-waisted
gown tied with a wide girdle underneath
her bosom low round-cut neck and tiny
ball-puff sleeves that left her lovely arms
uncovered to the shoulder she was like
rose beauharnais or madame de fon-
tenay except for her fair hair and her
eyes her eyes were like an eastern
slaves languishing and passionate even
when she laughed and she was laugh-
ing then with a throaty almost caressing
laugh as i tossed the flower up to her
and she leant across the iron railing
snatching at it futilely as it fell just short
of reach

   cest sans profit she laughed at
last your skill is too small or my arm
too short msieur bring it up to me

   you mean for me to come up there
i asked

   but certainly i have teeth but will
not bite you-maybe

  the street door to the house was
open i pushed it back groped my wray
along a narrow hall and climbed a flight
of winding stairs she was waiting for
me on the balcony lovelier close up if
that were possible than when id seen her
from the sidewalk her gown was china
silk so sheer and clinging that the shad-
ow of her charming figure showed against
its rippling folds like a lovely silhouette
the sash which bound it was a six-foot
length of rainbow ribbon tied coquettishly
beneath her shoulders and trailing in
fringed ends almost to her dress-hem at
the back her feet were stockingless and
shod with sandals fastened with cross-
straps of purple grosgrain laced about the
ankles save for the small gold rings that

scintillated in her ears she wore no orna-
ments of any kind

   alon fleur msieur she ordered
haughtily stretching out her hand then
her eyes lighted with sudden laughter and
she turned her back to me bending her
head forward but no it fell into your
hands it is that you must put in its place
again she ordered pointing to a curl
where she wished the flower set come
msieur i wait upon you

  on the settee by the wall a guitar lay
she picked it up and ran her slim pale
fingers twice across the strings sounding
a soft melancholy chord when she be-
gan to sing her words were slurred and
languorous and i had trouble under-
standing them for the song was ancient
when bienville turned the first spadeful
of earth that marked the ramparts of new
orleans

o knights of gay toulouse
and sweet beaucaire

greet me my own true love
and speak him fair   

  her voice had the throaty velvety
quality one hears in people of die south-
ern countries and the words of the song
seemed fairly to yearn with the sadness
and passionate longing of the love-bereft
but she smiled as she put by her instru-
ment a curious smile which heightened
the mystery of her face and her wide eyes
seemed suddenly half questing half
drowsy as she asked would you ride off
upon your grim pale horse and leave
poor little julie dayen famishing for
love msieur

   ride off from you i answered gal-
lantly how can you ask a verse from
burns came to me

then fare thee well my bonny lass

         and fare thee well awhile

      and i will come to thee again
        an it were ten thouiand mile

  there was something avid in the look
she gave me something more than mere
gratified vanity shone in her eyes as she
pledged to the dead



turned her face up to me in the moon-
light you mean it she demanded in
a quivering breathless voice

   of course i bantered how could
you doubt it

   then swear it-seal the oath with
blood

  her eyes were almost closed and her
lips were lightly parted as she leant to-
ward me i could see the thin white line
of tiny gleaming teeth behind the lush
red of her lips the tip of a pink tongue
swept across her mouth leaving it
warmer moister redder than before in
her throat a small pulse throbbed palpi-
tatingly her lips were smooth and soft
as the flower-petals in her hair but as
they crushed on mine they seemed to
creep about them as though endowed with
a volition of their own i could feel them
gliding almost stealthily searching greed-
ily it seemed until they covered my en-
tire mouth then came a sudden searing
burn of pain which passed as quickly as
it flashed across my lips and she seemed
inhaling deeply desperately as though to
pump the last faint gasp of breath up
from my lungs a humming sounded in
my ears everything went dark around
me as if i had been plunged in some
abysmal flood a spell of dreamy lassitude
was stealing over me when she pushed
me from her so abruptly that i staggered
back against the iron railing of the gal-
lery

t gasped and fought for breath like a
-i winded swimmer coming from the
water but the half-recaptured breath
seemed suddenly to catch itself unbidden
in my throat and a tingling chill went
rippling up my spine the girl had
dropped down to her knees staring at
the door which let into the house and
as i looked i saw a shadow writhe across
the little pool of moonlight which lay
upon the sill three feet or so in length

it was thick through as a man s wrist
the faint light shining dully on its scaly
armor and disclosing the forked lightning
of its darting tongue itwas a cotton -
mouth-a water moccasin-deadly as a
rattlesnake but more dangerous for it
sounds no warning before striking and
can strike when only half coiled how
it came there on the second-story gallery
of a house so far from any swampland i
had no means of knowing but there it
lay bent in the design of a double s
its wedge-shaped head swaying on up-
reared neck a scant six inches from the
girls soft bosom its forked tongue dart-
ing deathly menace half paralyzed with
fear and loathing i stood there in a per-
fect ecstasy of horror not daring to move
hand or foot lest i aggravate the reptile
into striking but my terror changed to
stark amazement as my senses slowly
registered the scene the girl was talking
to the snake and-it listened as a person
might have done

   non non grandtante hcdte la
she whispered cela est a noi-il est
devoue

  the serpent seemed to pause uncer-
tainly grudgingly as though but half
convinced then shook its head from side
to side much as an aged person might
when only half persuaded by a young-
sters argument finally silently as a
shadow it slithered back again into the
darkness of the house

  julie bounded to her feet and put her
hands upon my shoulders

   you mus go my friend she whis-
pered fiercely quickly ere she comes
again it was not easy to convince her
she is old and very doubting o i am
afraid-afraid

  she hid her face against my arm and
i could feel the throbbing of her heart
against me her hands stole upward to my
cheeks and pressed them between palms
as cold as graveyard clay as she whis-


weird tales

pered look at me mon beau her eyes
were closed her lips were slightly parted
and beneath the arc of her long lashes i
could see the glimmer of fast-forming
tears embrasse moi she commanded in
a trembling breath kiss me and go quick-
ly but o mon cher do not forget poor
little foolish julie dayen who has put
her trust in you come to me again to-
morrow night

  i was reeling as from vertigo as i
walked back to the greenwald and the
bartender looked at me suspiciously when
i ordered a sazarac theyve a strict rule
against serving drunken men at that hotel
the liquor stung my lips like liquid
flame and i put the cocktail down half
finished when i set the fan to going
and switched the light on in my room i
looked into the mirror and saw two little
beads of fresh bright blood upon my
lips good lord i murmured stupidly
as i brushed the blood away she bit me

  it all seemed so incredible that if i
had not seen the blood upon my mouth
id have thought i suffered from some
lunatic hallucination or one too many
frappes at the absinthe house julie was
as quaint and out of time as a directoire
print even in a city where time stands
still as it does in old new orleans her
costume her half-shy boldness her-this
was simply madness nothing less-her
conversation with that snake

  what was it she had said my french
was none too good and in the circum-
stances it was hardly possible to pay at-
tention to her words but if id under-
stood her shed declared hes mine he
has dedicated himself to me and shed
aaddressed that crawling horror as
 grandt ante-great-aunt 

   feller youre as crazy as a cock-
roach i admonished my reflection in the
mirror but i know whatll cure you

youre taking the first train north tomor-
row morning and if i ever catch you in
the vieux carre again ill-

  a sibilating hiss no louder than the
noise made by steam escaping from a
kettle-spout sounded close beside my
foot there on the rug coiled in readi-
ness to strike was a three-foot cotton-
mouth head swaying viciously from side
to side wicked eyes shining in the bright
light from the chandelier i saw the
muscles in the creatures fore-part swell
and in a sort of horror-trance i watched
its head dart forward but miraculously
it stopped its stroke half-way and drew
its head back turning to glance menacing-
ly at me first from one eye then the
other somehow it seemed to me the
thing was playing with me as a cat might
play a mouse threatening intimidating
letting me know it was master of die
situation and could kill me any time it
wished but deliberately refraining from
the deadi-stroke

  with one leap i was in the middle of
my bed and when a squad of bellboys
came running in response to the frantic
call for help i telephoned theyr found me
crouched against die headboard almost
wild with fear

  they turned die room completely in-
side out rolling back the rugs probing
into chairs and sofa emptying the bureau
drawers even taking down the towels
from the bathroom rack but nowhere was
there any sign of the water moccasin that
had terrified me at the end of fifteen
minutes search they accepted half a dol-
lar each and went grinning from the
room i knew it would be useless to
appeal for help again for i heard one
whisper to another as they paused out-
side my door it aint right to let them
yankees loose in norleans they dont
know how to hold dieir licker
pledged to the dead



t didnt take a train next morning

    somehow id an idea-crazy as it
seemed-that my promise to myself and
the sudden inexplicable appearance of the
snake beside my foot were related in some
way just after luncheon i thought id
put the theory to a test

   well i said aloud t guess i might
as well start packing dont want to let
the sun go down and find me here-

  my theory was right i hadnt fin-
ished speaking when i heard the warning
hiss and there poised ready for the
stroke the snake was coiled before the
door and it was no phantom either
no figment of an overwrought imagina-
tion it lay upon a rug the hotel man-
agement had placed before the door to
take the wear of constant passage from
the carpet and i could see the high pile
of the rug crushed down beneath its
weight it was flesh and scales-and
fangs-and it coiled and threatened me
in my twelfth-floor room in the bright
sunlight of the afternoon

  little chills of terror chased eadi
other up my back and i could feel the
short hairs on my neck grow stiff and
scratch against my collar but i kept my-
self in hand pretending to ignore the
loathsome thing i flung myself upon the
bed

   oh well i said aloud there really
isnt any need of hurrying i promised
julie that id come to her tonight and i
mustnt disappoint her half a minute
later i roused myself upon my elbow and
glanced toward the door the snake was
gone

   heres a letter for you mr minton
said the desk clerk as i paused to leave my
key the note was on gray paper edged
with silver-gilt and very highly scented
the penmanship was tiny stilted and ill-
formed as though the author were un-
used to writing but i could make it out

adore

     meet me in st denis cemetery at sunset
       a vous de coeur pour ieternite

                                      jdlie

  i stuffed the note back in my pocket
the more i thought about the whole
affair the less i liked it the flirtation had
begun harmlessly enough and julie was
as lovely and appealing as a figure in a
fairy-tale but there are unpleasant aspects
to most fairy-tales and this was no ex-
ception that scene last night when she
had seemed to argue with a full-grown
cottonmouth and the mysterious appear-
ance of the snake whenever i spoke of
breaking my promise to go back to her
-there was something too much like
black magic in it now she addressed me
as her adored and signed herself for
eternity finally named a graveyard as our
rendezvous things had become a little
bit too thick

  i was standing at the corner of canal
and baronne streets and crowds of office
workers and late shoppers elbowed past
me ill be damned if ill meet her in
a cemetery or anywhere else i mut-
tered tve had enough of all this non-
sense-

  a womans shrill scream echoed by a
mans hoarse shout of terror interrupted
me on the marble pavement of canal
street with half a thousand people bus-
tling by lay coiled a three-foot water
moccasin here was proof id seen it
twice in my room at the hotel but id
been alone each time some form of
weird hypnosis might have made me
think i saw it but the screaming woman
and the shouting man these panic-stricken
people in canal street couldnt all be
victims of a spell which had been cast
on me all right ill go i almost
shouted and instantly as though it been
but a puff of smoke the snake was gone
the half-fainting woman and a crowd of


weird tales

curious bystanders asking what was wrong
left to prove i had not been the victim
of some strange delusion

v ld saint denis cemetery lay drows-
v- ing in the blue faint twilight it
has no graves as we know them for
when the city was laid out it was below
sea-level and bodies were stored away in
crypts set row on row like lines of pigeon-
holes in walls as thick as those of me-
diaeval castles grass-grown aisles run
between the rows of vaults and the
effect is a true city of the dead with nar-
row streets shut in by close-set houses
the rattle of a trolley car in rampart
street came to me faintly as i walked
between the rows of tombs from the
river came the mellow-throated bellow
of a steamers whistle but both sounds
were muted as though heard from a great
distance the tomb-lined bastions of
saint denis hold the present out as firmly
as they hold the memories of the past
within

  down one aisle and up another i
walked the close-dipped turf deadening
my footfalls so i might have been a ghost
come back to haunt the ancient burial
ground but nowhere was there sign or
trace of julie i made the circuit of the
labyrinth and finally paused before one
of the more pretentious tombs

   looks as if shed stood me up i
murmured if she has i have a good
excuse to-

   but non tnon coeur i have not dis-
appointed you a soft voice whispered in
my ear see i am here

  i think i must have jumped at sound
of her greeting for she clapped her hands
delightedly before she put them on my
shoulders and turned her face up for a
kiss silly one she chided did you
think your julie was unfaithful

  i put her hands away as gently as i
could for her utter self-surrender was

embarrassing where were you i asked
striving to make neutral conversation
ive been prowling round this graveyard
for the last half-hour and came through
this aisle not a minute ago but i didnt

see you-

   ah but i saw you chert i have
watched you as you made your solemn
rounds like a watchman of the night
ohe but it was hard to wait until the
sun went down to greet you mon petit
she laughed again and her mirth was
mellowly musical as the gurgle of cool
water poured from a silver vase

   how could you have seen me i
demanded where were you all this
time

   but here of course she answered
naively resting one hand against the
graystone slab that sealed the tomb

  i shook my head bewilderedly the
tomb like all the others in the deeply
recessed wall was of rough cement in-
crusted with small seashells and its sides
were straight and blank without a spear
of ivy clinging to them a sparrow could
not have found cover there yet   
julie raised herself on tiptoe and
stretched her arms out right and left
while she looked at me through half-
closed smiling eyes je suis engourdie-
i am stiff with sleep she told me stifling
a yawn but now that you are come mon
cher i am wakeful as the pussy-cat that
rouses at the scampering of the mouse
come let us walk in this garden of mine
she linked her arm through mine and
started down the grassy grave-lined path

  tiny shivers - not of cold - were
flickering through my cheeks and down
my neck beneath my ears i had to have
an explanation    the snake her declara-
tion that she watched me as i searched
the cemetery-and from a tomb where a
beetle could not have found a hiding-
place-her announcement she was still
stiff from sleeping now her reference
pledged to the dead



to a half-forgotten graveyard as her gar-
den

   see here i want to know- i

started but she laid her hand across my
lips

   do not ask to know too soon mon
coeur she bade look at me am i not
veritably elegante she stood back a step
gathered up her skirts and swept me a
deep curtsy

  there was no denying she was beauti-
ful her tightly curling hair had been
combed high and tied back with a fillet
of bright violet tissue which bound her
brows like a diadem and at the front of
which an aigret plume wtas set in her
ears were hung two beautifully matdied
cameos outlined in gold and seed-pearls
and almost large as silver dollars a neck-
lace of antique dull-gold hung round her
throat and its pendant was a duplicate of
her ear-cameos while a bracelet of matt-
gold set with a fourth matched anaglyph
was clasped about her left arm just above
the elbow her gown was sheer white
muslin low cut at front and back with
little puff-sleeves at the shoulders fitted
tightly at the bodice and flaring sharply
from a high-set waist over it she wore
a narrow scarf of violet silk hung be-
hind her neck and dropping down on
either side in front like a clergymans
stole her sandals wrere gilt leather heel-
less as a ballet dancers shoes and laced
with violet ribbons her lovely pearl-
white hands were bare of rings but on
the second toe of her right foot there
showed a little cameo which matched the
others which she wore

  i could feel my heart begin to pound
and my breath come quicker as i looked
at her but

   you look as if youre going to a
masquerade i said

  a look of hurt surprize showed in
her eyes a masquerade she echoed
but no it is my best my very finest

that i wear for you tonight mon adore
do not you like it do you not love me
edouard

   no i answered shortly i do not
we might as wrell understand each other
julie im not in love with you and i
never was its been a pretty flirtation
nothing more im going home tomor-
row and-

   but you will come again surely you
will come again she pleaded you can-
not mean it when you say you do not
love me edouard tell me that you

spoke so but to tease me-

  a warning hiss sounded in the grass
beside my foot but i was too angry to be
frightened go ahead set your devilish
snake on me i taunted let it bite me

id as soon be dead as-

  the snake was quick but julie
quicker in the split-second required for
the thing to drive at me she leaped
across the grass-grown aisle and pushed
me back so violent was the shove she
gave me that i fell against the tomb
struck my head against a small projecting
stone and stumbled to my knees as i
fought for footing on the slippery grass
i saw die deadly wedge-shaped head
strike full against the girls bare ankle
and heard her gasp with pain the snake
recoiled and swung its head toward me
but julie dropped down to her knees and
spread her arms protectingly about me
tr non non grandtante she

screamed not this one let me- her

voice broke on a little gasp and with a
retching hiccup she sank limply to the
grass

   i tried to rise but my foot slipped on
the grass and i fell back heavily against
the tomb crashing my brow against its
shell-set cement wall i saw julie lying
in a little huddled heap of white against
the blackness of the sward and shadowy
but clearly visible an aged wrinkled
negress with turbaned head and cambric


weird tales

apron bending over her nursing her head
against her bosom and rocking back and
forth grotesquely while she crooned a
wordless threnody where had she come
from i wondered idly where had the
snake gone why did the moonlight
seem to fade and flicker like a dying
lamp once more i tried to rise but
slipped back to the grass before the tomb
as everything went black before me

  the lavender light of early morning
was streaming over the tomb-walls of the
cemetery when i wjaked i lay quiet for
a little while wondering sleepily how i
came there then just as the first rays of
the sun shot through the thinning shad-
ows i remembered julie the snake
had bitten her when she flung herself be-
fore me she was gone the old negress
-where had she come from-was gone
too and i was utterly alone in the old
graveyard

  stiff from lying on the ground i got
myself up awkwardly grasping at the
flower-shelf projecting from the tomb
as my eyes came level with the slab that
sealed the crypt i felt the breath catch in
my throat the crypt like all its fellows
looked for all the world like an old oven
let into a brick wall overlaid with peel-
ing plaster the sealing-stone was prob-
ably once white but years had stained it
to a dirty gray and time had all but
rubbed its legend out still i could see
the faint inscription carved in quaint
old-fashioned letters and disbelief gave
way to incredulity which was replaced
by panic terror as i read

ici repose malbeureusement
jule arnelie marie dayen
nation ale de paris france
nee le  aout 
dice die a la n o le  juillet 

  julie little julie whom id held in
my arms whose mouth had lain on mine
in eager kisses was a corpse dead and
in ker grave more than a century

the silence lengthened ned stared
miserably before him his outward
eyes unseeing but his minds eye turned
upon that scene in old saint denis cem-
etery de grandin tugged and tugged
again at the ends of his mustache till i
thought hed drag the hairs out by the
roots i could think of nothing which
might ease the tension till

  of course the name cut on the tomb-
stone was a piece of pure coincidence i
hazarded most likely the young
woman deliberately assumed it to mis-
lead you-

  and the snake which threatened our
young friend he was an assumption
also one infers de grandin inter-
rupted

  n-o but it could have been a trick
ned saw an aged negress in the cem-
etery and those old southern darkies

have strange powers-

  i damn think that you hit the thumb
upon the nail that time my friend the
little frenchman nodded though you do
not realize how accurate your diagnosis
is to ned

  have you seen this snake again since
coming north

  yes ned replied i have i was
too stunned to speak when i read the
epitaph and i wandered back to the
hotel in a sort of daze and packed my
bags in silence possibly thats why there
was no further visitation there i dont
know i do know nothing further hap-
pened though and when several months
had passed with nothing but my mem-
ories to remind me of the incident i be-
gan to think id suffered from some sort
of walking nightmare nella and i went
ahead with preparations for our wedding
but three weeks ago the potman brought

me this-

  he reached into an inrer pocket and
drew out an envelope it was of soft gray
pledged to the dead



 paper edged with silver-gilt and the ad-
 dress was in tiny almost unreadable
 script

m edouard minton

                     rue carteret 
                    harrisonville n j

 um de grandin commented as he
 inspected it it is addressed a la fran-
 dise and the letter may one read it
 of course ned answered id like
 you to

    across de grandins shoulder i made
 out the hastily-scrawled missive

 adore

 remember your promise and the kiss of blood
 that sealed it soon  shall call and you must
 come

     pour le temps el pour veternite

julie

    you recognize the w-riting de gran-
 din asked it is-

    oh yes ned answered bitterly i
 recognize it its the same the other note
 was written in

    and then

    the boy smiled bleakly i crushed
 the thing into a ball and threw it on the
 floor and stamped on it swore id die
 before id keep another rendezvous with

 her and- he broke off and put

 trembling hands up to his face

 the so mysterious serpent came
 again one may assume de grandin
 prompted

    but its only a phantom snake i
 interjected at worst its nothing more

 than a terrifying vision-

 think so ned broke in dye re-
 member rowdy my airedale terrier

 i nodded

 he was in the room when i opened
 this letter and when the cottonmouth
 appeared beside me on the floor he made
 a dash for it whether it would have
 struck me i dont know but it struck at
 him as he leaped and caught him squarely

in the throat he thrashed and fought
and the thing held on with locked jaws
till i grabbed a fire-shovel and made for
it then before i could strike it van-
ished

  but its venom didnt poor old
rowdy was dead before i could get him
out of the house but i took his corpse to
doctor kirchoff the veterinary and told
him rowdy died suddenly and i wanted
him to make an autopsy he went back
to his operating-room and stayed there
half an hour when he came back to
the office he was wiping his glasses and
wore the most astonished look ive ever
seen on a human face you say your dog
died suddenly-in the house he asked

    yes i told him just rolled over
and died

    well bless my soul thats the most
amazing thing i ever heard he an-
swered i cant account for it that dog
died from snake-bite copperhead id
say and the marks of the fangs show
plainly on his throat 

  but i thought you said it was a
water moccasin i objected now
doctor kirchoff says it was a copper-
head-

  ah bah de grandin laughed a
thought unpleasantly did no one ever
tell you that the copperhead and mocca-
sin are of close kind my friend have
not you heard some ophiologists maintain
the moccasin is but a dark variety of
copperhead he did not pause for my
reply but turned again to ned

  one understands your chivalry mon-
sieur for yourself you have no fear
since after all at times life can be bought
too dearly but the death of your small
dog has put a different aspect on the
matter if this never-to-be-sufficiently-
anathematized serpent which comes and
goes like the boite a surprise-the how
do you call him jack from the box-is
enough a ghost thing to appear at any


weird tales

time and place it wills but sufficiently
physical to exude venom whidi will kill a
strong and healthy terrier you have the
fear for mademoiselle nella riest-ce-
pas

  precisely you-

   and you are wrell advised to have the
caution my young friend we face a
serious condition

  what do you advise

  the frenchman teased his needle-
point mustache-tip with a thoughtful
thumb and forefinger for the present
nothing he replied at length let me
look this situation over let me view it
from all angles whatever i might tell
you now would probably be wrong sup-
pose we meet again one week from now
by that time i should have my data well
in hand

  and in the meantime-

   continue to be coy with mademoiselle
nella perhaps it would be well if you
recalled important business whidi re-
quires that you leave town till you hear
from me again there is no need to put
her life in peril at this time

tf it werent for kirchoffs testimony
id say ned minton had gone raving
crazy i declared as the door closed on
our visitors the whole things wilder
than an opium smokers dream-that
meeting with the girl in new orleans
the snake that comes and disappears the
assignation in the cemetery-its all too
preposterous but i know kirchoff hes
as unimaginative as a side of sole-
leather and as efficient as he is unim-
aginative if he says mintons dog died
of snake-bite thats what it died of
but the whole affairs so utterly fantas-
tic-

  agreed de grandin nodded but
what is fantasy but die appearance of
mental images as such severed from or-

dinary relations the ordinary relations
of images are those to which we are ac-
customed which conform to our experi-
ence the wider that experience the
more ordinary will we find extraordinary
relations by example take yourself you
sit in a dark auditorium and see a rail-
way train come rushing at you now it
is not at all in ordinary experience for
a locomotive to come dashing in a theater
filled with people it is quite otherwise
but you keep your seat you do not flindi
you are not frightened it is nothing but
a motion picture which you understand
but if you were a savage from new
guinea you would rise and fly in panic
from this steaming shrieking iron mon-
ster which bears down on you tiens it
is a matter of experience you see to
you it is an everyday event to the sav-
age it would be a new and terrifying
thing

  or perhaps you are at the hospital
you place a patient between you and the
crookes tube of an x-ray you turn on
the current you observe him through the
fluoroscope and pouf his flesh all melts
away and his bones spring out in sharp
relief three hundred years ago you
would have howled like a stoned dog at
the sight and prayed to be delivered
from die witchcraft which produced it
today you curse and swear like twenty
drunken pirates if the rontgenologist is
but thirty seconds late in setting up the
apparatus these things are scientific
you understand their underlying form-
ula therefore they seem natural but
mention what you please to call the oc-
cult and you scoff and that is but ad-
mitting that you are opposed to some-
thing which you do not understand the
credible and believable is that to which
we are accustomed the fantastic and in-
credible is what we cannot explain in
terms of previous experience voilti cest t

pledged to the dead



  you mean to say you understand all
this

  not at all by any means i am clever
me but not that clever no my friend i
am as much in the dark as you only i do
not refuse to credit what our young
friend tells us i believe the things he
has related happened exactly as he has
recounted them i do not understand
but i believe accordingly i must probe
i must sift i must examine this matter
we see it now as a group of unrelated
and irrelevant occurrences but some-
where lies the key which will enable us
to make harmony from this discord to
gather these stray tangled threads into
an ordered pattern i go to seek that
key

  where

  to new orleans of course tonight
i pack my portmanteaux tomorrow i en-
train just now-he smothered a tre-
mendous yawn-now i do what every
wise man does as often as he can i take
a drink

seven evenings later we gathered in
my study de grandin ned and i
and from the little frenchmans shining
eyes i knew his quest had been pro-
ductive of results

  my friends he told us solemnly
i am a clever person and a lucky one
as well the morning after my arrival at
new orleans i enjoyed three ramos
fizzes then went to sit in city park by
the old dueling-oak and wished with all
my heart that i had taken four and
while i sat in self-reproachful thought
sorrowing for the drink that i had
missed behold one passed by whom i
recognized he was my old schoolfellow
paul dubois now a priest in holy orders
and attached to the cathedral of saint
louis

  he took me to his quarters that
good pious man and gave me luncheon

it was friday and a fast day so we
fasted mon deu but we did fast on
creole gumbo and oysters a la rocke-
feller and baked pompano and little
shrimp fried crisp in olive oil and chicory
salad and seven different kinds of cheese
and wine when we were so filled with
fasting that we could not eat another
morsel my old friend took me to another
priest a native of new orleans whose
stock of local lore was second only to his
marvelous capacity for fine champagne
morbleu how i admire that one and
now attend me very carefully my
friends what he disclosed to me makes
many hidden mysteries all clear

  in newr orleans there lived a wealthy
family named dayen they possessed
much gold and land a thousand slaves
or more and one fair daughter by the
name of julie when this country bought
the louisiana territory from napoleon
and your army came to occupy the forts
this young girl fell in love with a young
officer a lieutenant philip merriweil
tenez army love in those times was no
different than it is today it seems this
gay young lieutenant he came he wooed


weird tales

he won he rode away and little julie
wept and sighed and finally died of
heartbreak in her lovesick illness she
had for constant company a slave an old
mulatress known to most as maman dra-
gonne but to julie simply as grandtante
great-aunt she had nursed our little
julie at the breast and all her life she
fostered and attended her to her little
white mams ell e she was all gentleness
and kindness but to others she was fierce
and frightful for she was a conjon
woman adept at obeah the black magic
of the congo and among the blacks she
ruled as queen by force of fear while the
whites were wont to treat her with re-
spect and it was more than merely whis-
pered retain her services upon occasion
she could sell protection to the duelist
and he who bore her charm would surely
conquer on the field of honor she
brewed love-drafts which turned the
hearts and heads of the most capricious
coquettes or the most constant wives as
occasion warranted by merely staring
fixedly at someone she could cause him to
take sick and die and-here we com-
mence to tread upon our own terrain-
she was said to have the power of chang-
ing to a snake at will

  very good you follow when poor
young julie died of heartbreak it was old
maman dragonne-the little white ones
grandtante-who watched beside her
bed it is said she stood beside her mis-
tress coffin and called a curse upon the
fickle lover swore he would come back
and die beside the body of the sweetheart
he deserted she also made a prophecy
julie should have many loves but her
body should not know corruption nor her
spirit rest until she could find one to
keep his promise and return to her with
words of love upon his lips those who
failed her should die horribly but he
who kept his pledge would bring her
rest and peace this augury she made

while she stood beside her mistress cof-
fin just before they sealed it in the tomb
in old saint denis cemetery then she
disappeared

  you mean she ran away i asked

  i mean she disappeared vanished
evanesced evaporated she was never
seen again not even by the people who
stood next to her when she pronounced
her prophecy

 but-

  no buts my friend if you will be so
kind years later when the british
stormed new orleans lieutenant merri-
well was there with general andrew
jackson he survived the battle like a
man whose life is charmed though all
around him comrades fell and three
horses were shot under him then when
the strife was done he went to the grand
banquet tendered to the victors while
gayety was at its height he abruptly left
the table next morning he was found
upon the grass before the tomb of julie
dayen he wfas dead he died from
snake-bite

  the years marched on and stories
spread about the town stories of a
strange and lovely belle dame sans merci
a modern circe who lured young gallants
to their doom time and again some
gay young blade of new orleans would
boast a conquest passing late at night
through royal street he would have a
flower dropped to him as he walked
underneath a balcony he would meet a
lovely girl dressed in the early empire
style and be surprized at the ease with
which he pushed his suit then-upon the
trees in chartres street appeared his fun-
eral notices he was dead invariably he
was dead of snake-bite parbleu it got to
be a saying that he who died mysteriously
must have met the lady of the moon-
light as he walked through royal street

  he paused and poured a thimbleful of
pledged to the dead



brandy in his coffee you see he
asked

  no im shot if i do i answered

i cant see the connection between-

  night and breaking dawn perhaps
he asked sarcastically if two and two
make four my friend and even you will
not deny they do then these tilings i
have told you give an explanation of our
young friends trouble this girl he met
was most indubitably julie poor little
julie dayen on whose tombstone it is
carved ici repose mdheureusement-
here lies unhappily the so mysterious
snake which menaces young monsieur
minton is none other than the aged ma-
man dragonne-grand tante as julie
called her

  but neds already failed to keep his
tryst i objected why didnt this
snake-woman sting him in the hotel
or-

  do you recall what julie said when
first the snake appeared he interrupted
not this one grandtante and again
in the old cemetery when the serpent
actually struck at him she threw herself
before him and received the blow it
could not permanently injure her to
earthly injuries the dead are proof but
the shock of it caused her to swoon it
seems monsieur he bowed to ned
you are more fortunate than any of
those others several times you have been
close to death but each time you escaped
you have been given chance and chance
again to keep your pledged word to the
dead a thing no other faithless lover of
the little julie ever had it seems mon-
sieur tliis dead girl truly loves you
how horrible i muttered

  you said it doctor trowbridge
ned seconded it looks as if im in a
spot all right

  mais non de grandin contradicted
escape is obvious my friend

  how in heavens name

  keep your promised word go back to
her

  good lord i cant do that go back
to a corpse take her in my arms-kiss
her

  certainement why not

  why-why shes dead

  is she not beautiful

  shes lovely and alluring as a sirens
song i think shes the most exquisite

thing ive ever seen but- he rose

and walked unsteadily across the room
if it werent for nella he said slowly
i might not find it hard to follow your
advice julies sweet and beautiful and
artless and affectionate as a child kind
too the way she stood between me and
that awful snake-thing but-oh its out
of the question

  then we must expand the question to
accommodate it my friend for the
safety of the living-for mademoiselle
nellas sake-and for the repose of the
dead you must keep the oath you swore
to little julie dayen you must go back
to new orleans and keep your ren-
dezvous

the dead of old saint denis lay in
dreamless sleep beneath the palely
argent rays of the fast-waxing moon the
oven-like tombs were gay with hardly-
wilted flowers for two days before was
all saints day and no grave in all new
orleans is so lowly no dead so long in-
terred that pious hands do not bear blos-
soms of remembrance to them on that
feast of memories

  de grandin had been busily engaged
all afternoon making mysterious trips to
the old negro quarter in company with
a patriarchal scion of indian and negro
ancestry who professed ability to guide
him to the citys foremost practitioner
of voodoo returning to the hotel only


weird tales

to dash out again to consult his friend at
the cathedral coming back to stare with
thoughtful eyes upon the changing pan-
orama of canal street while ned nerv-
ous as a race-horse at the barrier tramped
up and down the room lighting cigarette
from cigarette and drinking absinthe
frappes alternating with sharp bitter saz-
arac cocktails till i wondered that he did
not fall in utter alcoholic collapse by
evening i had that eery feeling that the
sane experience when alone with mad
folk i was ready to shriek at any un-
expected noise or turn and run at sight
of a strange shadow

  my friend de grandin ordered as
we reached the grass-paved corridor of
tombs where ned had told us the dayen
vaults were i suggest that you drink
this from an inner pocket he drew
out a tiny flask of ruby glass and snapped
its stopper loose a strong and slightly
acrid scent came to me sweet and spicy
faintly reminiscent of the odor of the
aromatic herbs one smells about a mum-
mys wrappings

  thanks ive had enough to drink al-
ready ned said shortly

  you are informing me mon vieux
the little frenchman answered with a
smile it is for that i brought this draft
along it will help you draw yourself
together you have need of all your
faculties this time believe me

  ned put the bottle to his lips drained
its contents hiccuped lightly then braced
his shoulders that is a pick-up he
complimented too bad you didnt let
me have it sooner sir i think i can go
through the ordeal now

  one is sure you can the frenchman
answered confidently walk slowfy
toward the spot where you last saw julie
if you please we shall await you here
in easy call if wfe are needed

  the aisle of tombs was empty as ned

left us the turf had been fresh-mown
for the day of visitation and was as
smooth and short as a lawn tennis court
a field-mouse could not have run across
the pathway without our seeing it this
much i noticed idly as ned trudged
away from us walking more like a man
on his way to the gallows than one who
went to keep a lovers rendezvous   
and suddenly he was not alone there
was another with him a girl dressed in
a clinging robe of sheer white muslin
cut in the charming fashion of the first
empire girdled high beneath the bosom
with a sash of light-blue ribbon a
wreath of pale gardenias lay upon her
bright fair hair her slender arms were
pearl-white in the moonlight as she
stepped toward ned i thought involun-
tarily of a line from sir john suckling

   her feet    like little mice stole in and out

  edouard cheri  coeur de mon
coeur eest veritablement toi thou hast
come willingly unasked petit am ant

  im here ned answered steadily

but only- he paused and drew a

sudden gasping breath as though a hand
had been laid on his throat

  cheri the girl asked in a trembling
voice you are cold to me do not you
love me then-you are not here because
your heart heard my heart calling o
heart of my hearts heart if you but knew
how i have longed and waited it has
been triste mon edouard lying in my
narrow bed alone while winter rains and
summer suns beat down listening for your
footfall i could have gone out at my
pleasure whenever moonlight made the
nights all bright with silver i could have
sought for other lovers but i would not
you held release for me within your
hands and if i might not have it from
you i would forfeit it for ever do not
you bring release for me my edouard
say that it is so
pledged to the dead



  an odd look came into the boys face
he might have seen her for the first
time and been dazzled by her beauty and
the winsome sweetness of her voice

  julie he whispered softly poor
patient faithful little julie

  in a single stride he crossed the inter-
vening turf and was on his knees before
her kissing her hands the hem of her
gown her sandaled feet and babbling
half-coherent broken words of love

  she put her hands upon his head as if
in benediction then turned them hold-
ing them palm-forward to his lips finally
crooked her fingers underneath his chin
and raised his face nay love sweet
love art thou a worshipper and i a saint
that thou should kneel to me she
asked him tenderly see my lips are
famishing for diine and wilt thou waste
thy kisses on my hands and feet and
garment make haste my heart we have
but little time and i would know the

kisses of redemption ere-

  they clung together in the moonlight
her white-robed lissome form and his
somberly-clad body seemed to melt and
merge in one while her hands reached up
to clasp his cheeks and draw his face
down to her yearning scarlet mouth

  de grandin was reciting something in
a mumbling monotone his words were
scarcely audible but i caught a phrase
occasionally   rest eternal grant to
her o lord  let light eternal shine
upon her    from the gates of hell her
soul deliver    kyrte eleison 
julie we heard neds despairing cry
and

  ha it comes it has begun it fin-
ishes de grandin whispered gratingly

  the girl had sunk down to the grass
as though she swooned one arm had
fallen limply from neds shoulder but
the other still was clasped about his neck
as we raced toward them adieu mon
amoureux adieu pour ce wionde adieu

pour iautre adieu pour peternite we
heard her sob when we reached him
ned knelt empty-armed before the tomb
of julie there was neither sign nor trace

  so assist him if you will my
friend de grandin bade motioning me
to take neds elbow help him to the
gate i follow quickly but first i have a
task to do

  as i led ned staggering like a
drunken man toward the cemetery exit
i heard the clang of metal striking metal
at the tomb behind us

twthat  yu stp to  

    i asked as we prepared for bed
at the hotel

  he flashed his quick infectious smile
at me and tweaked his mustache ends
for all the world like a self-satisfied tom-
cat furbishing his whiskers after finish-
ing a bowl of cream there was an
alteration to that epitaph i had to make
you recall it read rici repose malbeur-
eusement - here lies unhappily julie
dayen that is no longer true i chis-
eled off the malheureusement thanks to
monsieur edouards courage and my
cleverness the old ones prophecy was ful-
filled tonight and poor small julie has
found rest at last tomorrow morning
they celebrate the first of a series of mass-
es i have arranged for her at the cathe-
dral

  what was that drink you gave ned
just before he left us i asked curiously
it smelled like-

  rle bon dieu and the devil know-
not i he answered writh a grin it was
a voodoo love-potion i found the reali-
zation that she had been dead a century
and more so greatly troubled our young
friend that he swore he could not be af-
fectionate to our poor julie so i went
down to the negro quarter in the after-
noon and arranged to have a philtre
brewed eh bien that aged black one


weird tales

who concocted it assured me that she
could inspire love for the image of a
crocodile in the heart of anyone who
looked upon it after taking but a drop
of her decoction and she charged me
twenty dollars for it but i think i had
my moneys worth did it not work mar-
velously

  then julie s really gone neds com-
ing back released her from the spell-

  not wholly gone he corrected
her little body now is but a small hand-
ful of dust her spirit is no longer earth-
bound and the familiar demon who in
life was old maman dragonne has left
the earth w-ith her as well no longer
will she mctamorphosize into a snake and
kill the faithless ones who kiss her little
mistress and then forswear their troth

but-non my friend julie is not gone
entirely i think in the years to come
when ned and nella have long been
joined in wedded bliss there will be
minutes when julies face and julies
voice and the touch of julies little hands
will haunt his memory there will always
be one little corner of his heart which
never will belong to madame nella min-
ton for it will be for ever julies yes i
think that it is so

  slowly deliberately almost ritualistic-
ally he poured a glass of wine and raised
it to you my little poor one he said
softly as he looked across the sleeping
city toward old saint denis cemetery

you quit earth with a kiss upon your
lips may you sleep serene in paradise
until another kiss shall waken you

hich will scarcely be
  understood

     by robert e howard

small poets sing of little foolish things

as more befitting to a shallow brain
that dreams not of the pre-atlantean kings

nor launches on that dark uncharted main
that holds grim islands and unholy tides

where many a black mysterious secret hidts

true rime concerns her not with bursting buds

the chirping bird the lifting of the rose-

save ebon blooms that swell in ghastly woods

and that grim voiceless bird that ever broods
where through black boughs a wind of horror blows

                                        w t-
which will scarcely be understood



   oh little singers what know you of those
   ungodly slimy shapes that glide and crawl
   out of unreckoned gulfs when midnights fall

   to haunt the poets slumbering and close
   against his eyes thrust up their hissing head

   and mock him with their eyes so serpent-red

   conceived and bred in blackened pits of hell

   the poems come that set the stars on fire

   born of black maggots writhing in a shell
   men call a poets skull-an iron bell
   filled up with burning mist and golden mire

   the royal purple is a moldy shroud

   the laurel crown is cypress fixed with thorns

   the sword of fame a sidde notched and dull

   the face of beauty is a grinning skull

   and ever in their souls red caverns loud
   the rattle of the cloven hoofs and horns

   the poets know that justice is a lie

   that good and light are baubles filled with dust-
   this worlds slave-market where swine sell and buy
   this shambles where the howling cattle die

   has blinded not their eyes with lies and lust

   ring up the demons from the lower pit

   since evil conquers goodness in die end

   break down the door and let die fires be lit

   and greet each slavering monster as a friend

   let obscene shapes of darkness ride the earth

    let sacrificial smokes blot out the skies

   let dying virgins glut the black gods eyes

   and all the world resound with noisome mirth

   break down the altars let the streets run red
   tramp down the race into the crawling slime

   then where red chaos lifts her serpent head

   the fiend be praised well pen the perfect rime

hunned house

by h p lovecraft

ra posthumous story of immense power written by a master of weird fiction-
a tale of a revolting horror in the cellar of an old
house in new england

from even the greatest of horrors
irony is seldom absent sometimes
it enters directly into the composi-
tion of the events while sometimes it
relates only to their fortuitous position
among persons and places the latter
sort is splendidly exemplified by a case
in the ancient city of providence where
in die late forties edgar allan poe used
to sojourn often during his unsuccessful
wooing of the gifted poetess mrs whit-
man poe generally stopped at the man-
sion house in benefit street-the re-
named golden ball inn whose roof has
sheltered washington jefferson and
lafayette- and his favorite walk led
northward along the same street to mrs
whitmans home and the neighboring
hillside churchyard of st johns whose

 howard phillips lovecraft died
las march at the height of his ca-
reer though only forty-six years of
age he had built up an international
reputation by the artistry and im-
peccable literary craftsmanship of
his weird tales and he was regarded
on both sides of the atlantic as prob-
ably the greatest contemporary mas-
ter of weird fiction his ability to
create and sustain a mood of brood-
ing dread and unnamable horror is
nowhere better shown than in the
posthumous tale presented here
the shunned house



hidden expanse of eighteenth century
gravestones had for him a peculiar fas-
cination

  now the irony is this in this walk so
many times repeated the worlds great-
est master of the terrible and the bizarre
was obliged to pass a particular house
on the eastern side of the street a ding
antiquated structure perched on the
abruptly rising side hill with a great
unkempt yard dating from a time when
the region was partly open country it
does not appear that he ever wrote or
spoke of it nor is there any evidence
that he even noticed it and yet that
house to the two persons in possession
of certain information equals or out-
ranks in horror the wildest fantasy of the
genius who so often passed it unknow-
ingly and stands starkly leering as a
symbol of all that is unutterably hideous

  the house was-and for that matter
still is-of a kind to attract the attention
of the curious originally a farm or semi-
farm building it followed the average
new england colonial lines of the middle
eighteenth century - the prosperous
peaked-roof sort with two stories and
dormerless attic and with the georgian
doorway and interior panelling dictated
by the progress of taste at that time it
faced south with one gable end buried
to the lower windows in the eastward
rising hill and the other exposed to the
foundations toward the street its con-
struction over a century and a half ago
had followed the grading and straighten-


the shunned house



ing of the road in that especial vicinity
for benefit street-at first called back
street-was laid out as a lane winding
amongst the graveyards of the first set-
tlers and straightened only when the
removal of the bodies to the north burial
ground made it decently possible to cut
through the old family plots

  at the start the western wall had lain
some twenty feet up a precipitous law-n
from the roadway but a widening of the
street at about the time of the revolution
sheared off most of the intervening space
exposing the foundations so that a brick

basement wall had to be made giving
the deep cellar a street frontage with door
and one window above ground close to
the new line of public travel when
the sidewalk was laid out a century ago
the last of the intervening space was
removed and poe in his walks must
have seen only a sheer ascent of dull gray
brick flush with the sidewalk and sur-
mounted at a height of ten feet by the
antique shingled bulk of the house
proper

the farm-like ground extended back
very deeply up the hill almost to

weird tales

wheaton street the space south of the
house abutting on benefit street was of
course greatly above the existing side-
walk level forming a terrace bounded by
a high bank wall of damp mossy stone
pierced by a steep flight of narrow steps
which led inward between canyon-like
surfaces to the upper region of mangy
lawn rheumy brick walks and neglected
gardens whose dismantled cement urns
rusted kettles fallen from tripods of
knotty sticks and similar paraphernalia
set off the weather-beaten front door with
its broken fanlight rotting ionic pilasters
and wormy triangular pediment

what i heard in my youth about
the shunned house was merely that
people died there in alarmingly great
numbers that i was told was why the
original owners had moved out some
twenty years after building the place it
was plainly unhealthy perhaps because
of the dampness and fungous growths in
the cellar the general sickish smell the
drafts of the hallways or the quality of
the well and pump water these things
were bad enough and these were all that
gained belief among the persons whom

i	knew only the notebooks of my anti-
quarian uncle doctor elihu whipple re-
vealed to me at length the darker vaguer
surmises which formed an undercurrent
of folklore among old-time servants and
liumble folk surmises which never trav-
elled far and which were largely for-
gotten when providence grew to be a
metropolis with a shifting modern popu-
lation

  the general fact is that the house was
never regarded by the solid part of the
community as in any real sense haunted
there were no widespread tales of rattling
chains cold currents of air extinguished
lights or faces at the window extrem-
ists sometimes said the house was un-
lucky but that is as far as even they

went what was really beyond dispute
is that a frightful proportion of persons
died there or more accurately had died
there since after some peculiar happen-
ings over sixty years ago the building
had become deserted through the sheer
impossibility of renting it these persons
were not all cut off suddenly by any one
cause rather did it seem that their vitality
was insidiously sapped so that each one
died the sooner from whatever tendency
to weakness he may have naturally had
and those who did not die displayed in
varying degree a type of anemia or con-
sumption and sometimes a decline of the
mental faculties whidi spoke ill for the
salubriousness of the building neigh-
boring houses it must be added seemed
entirely free from the noxious quality

  this much i knew before my insistent
questioning led my uncle to show me the
notes which finally embarked us both on
our hideous investigation in my child-
hood the shunned house was vacant with
barren gnarled and terrible old trees
long queerly pale grass and nightmar-
ishly misshapen weeds in the high terraced
yard where birds never lingered we
boys used to overrun the place and i can
still recall my youthful terror not only at
the morbid strangeness of this sinister
vegetation but at the eldritdi atmosphere
and odor of the dilapidated house whose
unlocked front door was often entered in
quest of shudders the small-paned win-
dows were largely broken and a name-
less air of desolation hung round the
precarious panelling shaky interior shut-
ters peeling wall-paper falling plaster
rickety staircases and sudi fragments of
battered furniture as still remained the
dust and cobwebs added their touch of
the fearful and brave indeed was the
boy who would voluntarily ascend the
ladder to the attic a vast raftered length
lighted only by small blinking windows
in the gable ends and filled with a
the shunned house



massed wreckage of chests chairs and
spinning-wheels which infinite years of
deposit had shrouded and festooned into
monstrous and hellish shapes

  but after all the attic was not the
most terrible part of the house it was
the dank humid cellar which somehow
exerted the strongest repulsion on us
even though it was wholly above ground
on the street side with only a thin door
and window-pierced brick wall to sep-
arate it from the busy sidewalk we
scarcely knew whether to haunt it in
spectral fascination or to shun it for
the sake of our souls and our sanity for
one thing the bad odor of the house
was strongest there and for another
thing we did not like the white fungous
growths whidi occasionally sprang up in
rainy summer weather from the hard
earth floor those fungi grotesquely like
the vegetation in die yard outside were
truly horrible in their outlines detestable
parodies of toadstools and indian-pipes
whose like we had never seen in any other
situation they rotted quickly and at one
stage became slightly phosphorescent so
that nocturnal passers-by sometimes spoke
of witch-fires glowing behind the broken
panes of the fetor-spreading windows

  we never-even in our wildest hal-
loween moods - visited diis cellar by
night but in some of our daytime visits
could detect the phosphorescence espe-
cially when the day was dark and wet
there was also a subtler thing we often
thought we detected - a very strange
thing which was however merely sug-
gestive at most i refer to a sort of
cloudy whitish pattern on the dirt floor-
a vague shifting deposit of mold or niter
which we sometimes thought we could
trace amidst the sparse fungous growths
near the huge fireplace of the basement
kitchen once in a while it struck us
that this patch bore an uncanny resem-
blance to a doubled-up human figure

though generally no such kinship existed
and often diere was no whitish deposit
whatever

  on a certain rainy afternoon when this
illusion seemed phenomenally strong and
when in addition i had fancied i
glimpsed a kind of thin yellowish shim-
mering exhalation rising from the nit-
rous pattern toward the yawning fire-
place i spoke to my uncle about the
matter he smiled at this odd conceit
but it seemed that his smile was tinged
with reminiscence later i heard diat a
similar notion entered into some of the
wild ancient tales of the common folk
-a notion likewise alluding to ghoulish
wolfish shapes taken by smoke from the
great chimney and queer contours as-
sumed by certain of the sinuous tree-
roots that thrust their way into the cellar
through the loose foundation-stones

 

not till my adult years did my uncle
set before me the notes and data
which he had collected concerning the
shunned house doctor whipple was a
sane conservative physician of the old
school and for all his interest in the
place was not eager to encourage young
thoughts toward the abnormal his own
view postulating simply a building and
location of markedly unsanitary quali-
ties had nothing to do with abnormality
but he realized that die very picturesque-
ness which aroused his own interest would
in a boys fanciful mind take on all man-
ner of gruesome imaginative associations

  the doctor was a bachelor a white-
haired clean-shaven old-fashioned gen-
tleman and a local historian of note who
had often broken a lance with such con-
troversial guardians of tradition as sidney
s rider and thomas w bicknell he
lived with one man-servant in a georgian
homestead with knocker and iron-railed


weird tales

steps balanced eerily on the steep ascent
of north court street beside the ancient
brick court and colony house where his
grandfather-a cousin of that celebrated
privateersman captain whipple who
burnt his majestys armed schooner
gas pee in -had voted in the legis-
lature on may   for the inde-
pendence of the rhode island colony
around him in the damp low-ceiled li-
brary with the musty white panelling
heavy carved overmantel and small-paned
vine-shaded windows were the relics and
records of his ancient family among
which were many dubious allusions to the
shunned house in benefit street that
pest spot lies not far distant-for ben-
efit runs ledgewise just above the court
house along the precipitous hill up which
the first settlement climbed

  when in the end my insistent pester-
ing and maturing years evoked from my
uncle the hoarded lore i sought there lay
before me a strange enough chronicle
long-winded statistical and drearily
genealogical as some of the matter was
there ran through it a continuous thread
of brooding tenacious horror and pre-
ternatural malevolence which impressed
me even more than it had impressed the
good doctor separate events fitted to-
gether uncannily and seemingly irrel-
evant details held mines of hideous possi-
bilities a new and burning curiosity
grew in me compared to which my boy-
ish curiosity was feeble and inchoate

  the first revelation led to an exhaustive
research and finally to that shuddering
quest which proved so disastrous to my-
self and mine for at the last my uncle
insisted on joining the search i had
commenced and after a certain night in
that house he did not come aw-ay with
me i am lonely without that gentle soul
whose long years were filled only with
honor virtue good taste benevolence
and learning i have reared a marble urn

to his memory in st johns churchyard-
the place that poe loved-the hidden
grove of giant willows on the hill where
tombs and headstones huddle quietly be-
tween the hoary bulk of the church and
the houses and bank walls of benefit
street

  the history of the house opening
amidst a maze of dates revealed no trace
of the sinister either about its construction
or about the prosperous and honorable
family who built it yet from the first
a taint of calamity soon increased to
boding significance was apparent my
uncles carefully compiled record began
with the building of the structure in
 and followed the theme with an
unusual amount of detail the shunned
house it seems was first inhabited by
william harris and his wife rhoby dex-
ter with their children elkanah bom
in  abigail born in  william
jr born in  and ruth bom in
 harris was a substantial merchant
and seaman in the west india trade con-
nected with the firm of obadiah brown
and his nephews after browns death
in  the new firm of nicholas brown

	company made him master of the brig
prudence providence-built of  tons
thus enabling him to erect the new home-
stead he had desired ever since his mar-
riage

  the site he had chosen-a recently
straightened part of the new and fashion-
able back street which ran along the
side of the hill above crowded cheap-
side-was all that could be wished and
the building did justice to the location
it was the best that moderate means
could afford and harris hastened to
move in before the birth of a fifth child
which the family expected that child
a boy came in december but was still-
born nor was any child to be born alive
in that house for a century and a half

  the next april sickness occurred
the shunned house



among the children and abigail and
rudi died before the month was over
doctor job ives diagnosed the trouble as
some infantile fever though others de-
clared it was more of a mere wasting-
away or decline it seemed in any event
to be contagious for hannah bowen one
of the two servants died of it in the fol-
lowing june eli lideason the other serv-
ant constantly complained of weakness
and would have returned to his fathers
farm in rehoboth but for a sudden at-
tachment for mehitabel pierce who was
hired to succeed hannah he died the
next year-a sad year indeed since it
marked the death of william harris him-
self enfeebled as he was by the climate
of martinique where his occupation had
kept him for considerable periods during
the preceding decade

  the widowed rhoby harris never re-
covered from the shock of her husbands
death and the passing of her first-born
elkanah two years later was the final
blow to her reason in  she fell vic-
tim to a mild form of insanity and was
thereafter confined to the upper part of
the house her elder maiden sister mercy
dexter having moved in to take charge
of the family mercy was a plain raw-
boned woman of great strength but her
health visibly declined from the time of
her advent she was greatly devoted to
her unfortunate sister and had an especial
affection for her only surviving nephew
william who from a sturdy infant had
become a sickly spindling lad in this
year the servant mehitabel died and the
other servant preserved smith left with-
out coherent explanation-or at least
with only some wild tales and a com-
plaint that he disliked the smell of the
place for a time mercy could secure no
more help since the seven deaths and
case of madness all occurring within five
years space had begun to set in motion
the body of fireside rumor which later be-

came so bizarre ultimately however she
obtained new servants from out of town
ann white a morose woman from that
part of north kingstown now set off as
the township of exeter arid a capable
boston man named zenas low

it was ann white who first gave def-
inite shape to the sinister idle talk
mercy should have known better than to
hire anyone from the nooseneck hill
country for that remote bit of backwoods
was then as now a seat of the most un-
comfortable superstitions as lately as
 an exeter community exhumed a
dead body and ceremoniously burnt its
heart in order to prevent certain alleged
visitations injurious to the public health
and peace and one may imagine the
point of view of the same section in
 anns tongue was perniciously ac-
tive and within a few months mercy
discharged her filling her place with a
faithful and amiable amazon from new-
port maria robbins

  meanwhile poor rhoby harris in her
madness gave voice to dreams and
imaginings of the most hideous sort at
times her screams became insupportable
and for long periods she would utter
shrieking horrors which necessitated her
sons temporary residence with his cousin
peleg harris in presbyterian lane near
the new college building the boy would
seem to improve after these visits and had
mercy been as wise as she was well-mean-
ing she would have let him live perma-
nently with peleg just what mrs harris
cried out in her fits of violence tradition
hesitates to say or rather presents such
extravagant accounts that they nullify
themselves through sheer absurdity cer-
tainly it sounds absurd to hear that a
woman educated only in the rudiments
of french often shouted for hours in a
coarse and idiomatic form of that lan-
guage or that the same person alone and


weird tales

guarded complained wildly of a staring
thing which bit and chewed at her in
 the servant zenas died and when
mrs harris heard of it she laughed with
a shocking delight utterly foreign to her
the next year she herself died and was
laid to rest in the north burial ground
beside her husband

  upon the outbreak of trouble with
great britain in  william harris
despite his scant sixteen years and feeble
constitution managed to enlist in the
army of observation under general
greene and from that time on enjoyed a
steady rise in health and prestige in
 as a captain in the rhode island
forces in new jersey under colonel
angell he met and married phebe het-
field of elizabethtown whom he brought
to providence upon his honorable dis-
charge in the following year

  the young soldiers return was not a
thing of unmitigated happiness the
house it is true was still in good condi-
tion and the street had been widened
and changed in name from back street
to benefit street but mercy dexters
once robust frame had undergone a sad
and curious decay so that she was now a
stooped and pathetic figure w-ith hollow
voice and disconcerting pallor-qualities
shared to a singular degree by the one
remaining servant maria in the autumn
of  phebe harris gave birth to a
still-born daughter and on the fifteenth
of the next may mercy dexter took leave
of a useful austere and virtuous life

  william harris at last thoroughly con-
vinced of the radically unhealthful nature
of his abode now took steps toward
quitting it and closing it for ever secur-
ing temporary quarters for himself and
his wife at the newly opened golden ball
inn he arranged for the building of a
new and finer house in westminster
street in the growing part of the town
across the great bridge there in 

his son dutee was born and there the
family dwelt till the encroachments of
commerce drove them back across the
river and over the hill to angell street
in the newer east side residence district
where the late archer harris built his
sumptuous but hideous french-roofed
mansion in  william and phebe
both succumbed to the yellow fever epi-
demic of  but dutee was brought up
by his cousin rathbone harris pelegs
son

  rathbone was a practical man and
rented the benefit street house despite
williams wish to keep it vacant he
considered it an obligation to his ward to
make the most of all the boys property
nor did he concern himself with the
deaths and illnesses which caused so
many changes of tenants or the steadily
growing aversion with which the house
was generally regarded it is likely that he
felt only vexation when in  the
town council ordered him to fumigate the
place with sulfur tar and gum camphor
on account of the much-discussed deaths
of four persons presumably caused by
the then diminishing fever epidemic
they said the place had a febrile smell

  dutee himself thought little of the
house for he grew up to be a privateers-
man and served with distinction on the
vigilant under captain cahoone in the
war of  he returned unharmed
married in  and became a father on
that memorable night of september 
 when a great gale drove the waters
of the bay over half the town and floated
a tall sloop well up westminster street
so that its masts almost tapped the harris
windows in symbolic affirmation that the
new boy welcome was a seamans son

  welcome did not survive his father
but lived to perish gloriously at fred-
ericksburg in  neither he nor his
son archer knew of the shunned house
as other than a nuisance almost impos-
the shunned house



sible to rent-perhaps on account of the
mustincss and sickly odor of unkempt
old age indeed it never was rented after
a series of deaths culminating in 
which the excitement of the war tended
to throw into obscurity carrington har-
ris last of the male line knew it only as
a deserted and somewhat picturesque
center of legend until i told him my ex-
perience he had meant to tear it down
and build an apartment house on the site
but after my account decided to let it
stand install plumbing and rent it nor
has he yet had any difficulty in obtaining
tenants the horror has gone



it may well be imagined how power-
fully i was affected by the annals of
the harrises in this continuous record
there seemed to me to brood a persistent
evil beyond anything in nature as i had
known it an evil clearly connected with
the house and not with the family this
impression was confirmed by my uncles
less systematic array of miscellaneous data
-legends transcribed from servant gos-
sip cuttings from die papers copies of
death certificates by fellow-physicians
and the like all of this material i cannot
hope to give for my uncle was a tireless
antiquarian and very deeply interested in
the shunned house but i may refer to
several dominant points which earn notice
by their recurrence through many reports
from diverse sources for example the
servant gossip was practically unanimous
in attributing to the fungous and mal-
odorous cellar of the house a vast su-
premacy in evil influence there had been
servants-ann white especially-who
would not use the cellar kitchen and at
least three well-defined legends bore
upon the queer quasi-human or diabolic
outlines assumed by tree-roots and
patches of mold in that region these

latter narratives interested me profoundly
on account of what i had seen in my boy-
hood but i felt that most of the signifi-
cance had in each case been largely ob-
scured by additions from the common
stock of local ghost lore

  ann white with her exeter supersti-
tion had promulgated the most extrava-
gant and at the same time most consistent
tale alleging that there must lie buried
beneath the house one of those vampires
-the dead who retain their bodily form
and live on the blood or breath of the
living-whose hideous legions send their
preying shapes or spirits abroad by night
to destroy a vampire one must the

on a search under the cellar had been
prominent in bringing about her dis-
charge

audience and were the more readily ac-

sages of poor rhoby harriss ravings
where she complained of the sharp teeth
of a glassy-eyed half-visible presence

  free from unwarranted superstitition
though i am these things produced in
me an odd sensation which was intensi-
fied by a pair of widely separated news-
paper cuttings relating to deaths in the
shunned house-one from the providence


weird tales

gazette and country-ournal of april
  and the other from the daily
transcript and chronicle of october 
-each of which detailed an ap-
pallingly grisly circumstance whose dupli-
cation was remarkable it seems that in
both instances the dying person in 
a gentle old lady named stafford and in
 a schoolteacher of middle age
named eleazar durfee became trans-
figured in a horrible way glaring glassily
and attempting to bite the throat of the
attending physician even more puzzling
though was the final case which put an
end to the renting of the house-a scries
of anemia deaths preceded by progressive
madnesses wherein the patient would
craftily attempt the lives of his relatives
by incisions in the neck or wrist

  this was in i and  when my
uncle had just begun his medical prac-
tise and before leaving for the front he
heard much of it from his elder profes-
sional colleagues the really inexplicable
thing was the way in which the victims-
ignorant people for the ill-smelling and
widely shunned house could now be
rented to no others - would babble
maledictions in french a language they
could not possibly have studied to any
extent it made one think of poor rhoby
harris nearly a century before and so
moved my uncle that he commenced col-
lecting historical data on the house after
listening some time subsequent to his
return from the war to the first-hand ac-
count of doctors chase and whitmarsh
indeed i could see that my uncle had
thought deeply on the subject and that
he was glad of my own interest-an
open-minded and sympathetic interest
which enabled him to discuss with me
matters at which others would merely
have laughed his fancy had not gone so
far as mine but he felt that the place was
rare in its imaginative potentialities and

worthy of note as an inspiration in the
field of the grotesque and macabre

   for my part i wras disposed to take the
whole subject with profound seriousness
and began at once not only to review the
evidence but to accumulate as much
more as i could i talked with the elderly
archer harris then owner of the house
many times before his death in  and
obtained from him and his still surviving
maiden sister alice an authentic corro-
boration of all the family data my uncle
had collectcd when however i asked
them what connection with france or its
language the house could have they con-
fessed themselves as frankly baffled and
ignorant as i archer knew nothing and
all that miss harris could say was that
an old allusion her grandfather dutee
harris had heard of might have shed a
little light the old seaman who had
survived his son welcomes death in bat-
tle by two years had not himself known
the legend but recalled that his earliest
nurse the ancient maria robbins seemed
darkly aware of something that might
have lent a weird significance to the
french raving of rhoby harris which
she had so often heard during the last
days of that hapless woman maria had
been at the shunned house from  till
the removal of the family in  and
had seen mercy dexter die once she
hinted to the child dutee of a somewhat
peculiar circumstance in mercys last
moments but he had soon forgotten all
about it save that it was something pe-
culiar the granddaughter moreover re-
called even this much with difficulty she
and her brother were not so much in-
terested in the house as was archers
son carrington the present owner with
wrhom i talked after my experience

having exhausted the harris family
of all the information it could fur-
nish i turned my attention to early town
the shunned house



  records and deeds with a zeal more pene-
  trating than that which my uncle had oc-
  casionally shown in the same work what
  i wished was a comprehensive history of
  the site from its very settlement in 
  -or even before if any narragansett
  indian legend could be unearthed to sup-
  ply the data i found at the start that
  the land had been part of the long strip
  of home lot granted originally to john
  throckmorton one of many similar strips
  beginning at the town street beside the
  river and extending up over the hill to a
  line roughly corresponding with the
  modern hope street the throckmorton
  lot had later of course been much sub-
  divided and i became very assiduous in
  tracing that section through which back
  or benefit street was later run it had as
  rumor indeed said been the throck-
  morton graveyard but as i examined the
  records more carefully i found that the
  graves had all been transferred at an
  early date to the north burial ground on
  the pawtucket west road

    then suddenly i came-by a rare piece
  of chance since it was not in the main
  body of records and might easily have
  been missed-upon something which
  aroused my keenest eagerness fitting in
  as it did with several of the queerest
  phases of the affair it was the record of
  a lease in  of a small tract of
  ground to an etienne roulet and wife
  at last the french element had appeared
  -that and another deeper element of
  horror which the name conjured up from
  the darkest recesses of my weird and
  heterogeneous reading-and i feverishly
  studied the platting of the locality as it
  had been before the cutting through and
  partial straightening of back street be-
  tween  and  i found what i
  had half expected that where the
  shunned house now stood the roulets had
  laid out their graveyard behind a one-
  - story and attic cottage and that no record

of any transfer of graves existed the
document indeed ended in much con-
fusion and i was forced to ransack both
the rhode island historical society and
shepley library before t could find a
local door which the name of etienne
roulet would unlock in the end i did
find something something of such vague
but monstrous import that i set about at
once to examine the cellar of the shunned
house itself with a new and excited
minuteness

  the roulets it seemed had come in
 from east greenwich down the
west shore of narragansett bay they
were huguenots from canude and had
encountered much opposition before the
providence selectmen allowed them to
settle in the town unpopularity had
dogged them in east greenwich whither
they had come in  after the revoca-
tion of the edict of nantes and rumor
said that the cause of dislike extended
beyond mere racial and national
prejudice or the land disputes which in-
volved other french settlers with the
english in rivalries which not even gov-
ernor andros could quell but their
ardent protestantism-too ardent some
whispered - and their evident distress
when virtually driven from the village
down the bay had moved the sympathy
of the town fathers here the strangers
had been granted a haven and the
swarthy etienne roulet less apt at agri-
culture than at reading queer books and
drawing queer diagrams was given a
clerical post in the warehouse at pardon
tillinghasts wharf far south in town
street there had however been a riot
of some sort later on-perhaps forty
years later after old roulets death-
and no one seemed to hear of the family
after that

for a century and more it appeared
the roulets had been well remembered
and frequently discussed as vivid ind-

dents in the quiet life of a new england
seaport etiennes son paul a surly fel-
low whose erratic conduct had probably
provoked the riot which wiped out the
family was particularly a source of specu-
lation and though providence never
shared the witchcraft panics of her puri-
tan neighbors it was freely intimated by
old wives that his prayers were neither
uttered at the proper time nor directed
toward the proper object all this had
undoubtedly formed the basis of the leg-
end known by old maria robbins what
relation it had to the french ravings of
rhoby harris and other inhabitants of
the shunned house imagination or fu-
ture discovery alone could determine i
wondered how many of those who had
known the legends realized that addi-
tional link with the terrible which my
wider reading had given me that om-
inous item in the annals of morbid horror
whiich tells of the creature jacques
roulet of caude who in  was con-
demned to death as a demoniac but after-
ward saved from the stake by the paris
parliament and shut in a madhouse he
had been found covered with blood and
shreds of flesh in a wood shortly after
the killing and rending of a boy by a
pair of wolves one wolf wras seen to
lope away unhurt surely a pretty hearth-
side tale with a queer significance as to
name and place but i decided that the
providence gossips could not have gener-
ally known of it had they known the
coincidence of names would have brought
some drastic and frightened action-in-
deed might not its limited whispering
have precipitated the final riot which
erased the roulets from the town

i now visited the accursed place with
increased frequency studying the un-
wholesome vegetation of the garden ex-
amining all the walls of the building
and poring over every inch of the

earthen cellar floor finally with car-
rington harriss permission i fitted a
key to the disused door opening from the
cellar directly upon benefit street pre-
ferring to have a more immediateaccess
to the outside world than the dark stairs
ground-floor hall and front door could
give there where morbidity lurked most
thickly i searched and poked during
long afternoons when the sunlight filtered
in through the cobwebbed above-ground
windows and a sense of security glowed
from the unlocked door which placed
me only a few feet from the placid side-
walk outside nodiing new rewarded my
efforts-only the same depressing musti-
ness and faint suggestions of noxious
odors and nitrous outlines on the floor-
and i fancy diat many pedestrians must
have watched me curiously through the
broken panes

  at length upon a suggestion of my
uncles i decided to try the spot noctur-
nally and one stormy midnight ran die
beams of an electric torch over the moldy
floor with its uncanny shapes and dis-
torted half-phosphorescent fungi the
place had dispirited me curiously that
evening and i was almost prepared when
i saw-or thought i saw-amidst the
whitish deposits a particularly sharp defi-
nition of die huddled form i had sus-
pected from boyhood its clearness was
astonishing and unprecedented-and as i
watched i seemed to see again the thin
yellowish shimmering exhalation which
had startled me on that rainy afternoon
so many years before

  above the anthropomorphic patch of
mold by the fireplace it rose a subtle
sickish almost luminous vapor which as
it hung trembling in the dampness
seemed to develop vague and shocking
suggestions of form gradually trailing off
into nebulous decay and passing up into
the blackness of the great chimney with
a fetor in its wake it was truly horrible
the shunned house



and the more so to me because of what i
knew of the spot refusing to flee i
watched it fade-and as i watched i felt
that it was in turn watching me greedily
with eyes more imaginable than visible
when i told my uncle about it he was
greatly aroused and after a tense hour
of reflection arrived at a definite and
drastic decision weighing in his mind
the importance of the matter and the
significance of our relation to it he in-
sisted that we both test-and if possible
destroy-the horror of the house by a
joint night or nights of aggressive vigil
in that musty and fungus-cursed cellar



on wednesday june  
after a proper notification of car-
rington harris which did not include
surmises as to what we expected to find
my uncle and i conveyed to the shunned
house two camp chairs and a folding
camp cot together with some scientific
mechanism of greater weight and intri-
cacy these we placed in the cellar dur-
ing the day screening the windows with
paper and planning to return in the eve-
ning for our first vigil we had locked
the door from the cellar to the ground
floor and having a key to the outside
cellar door were prepared to leave our
expensive and delicate apparatus-which
we had obtained secretly and at great
cost-as many days as our vigils might
be protracted it was our design to sit
up together till very late and then watch
singly till dawn in two-hour stretches
myself first and then my companion the
inactive member resting on the cot

  the natural leadership with which my
uncle procured die instruments from the
laboratories of brown university and the
cranston street armory and instinctively
assumed direction of our venture was a
marvelous commentary on the potential

vitality and resilience of a man of eighty-
one elihu whipple had lived according
to die hygienic laws he had preached as
a physician and but for what happened
later would be here in full vigor today
only two persons suspected what did
happen-carrington harris and myself
i had to tell harris because he owned
the house and deserved to know what
had gone out of it then too we had
spoken to him in advance of our quest
and i felt after my uncles going that he
would understand and assist me in some
vitally necessary public explanations he
turned very pale but agreed to help me
and decided that it would now be safe
to rent the house

  to declare that we were not nervous
on that rainy night of watching would be
an exaggeration both gross and ridicu-
lous we were not as i have said in
any sense childishly superstitious but sci-
entific study and reflection had taught us
that the known universe of three dimen-
sions embraces the merest fraction of the
whole cosmos of substance and energy in
this case an overwhelming preponderance
of evidence from numerous authentic
sources pointed to the tenacious existence
of certain forces of great power and so
far as the human point of view is con-
cerned exceptional malignancy to say
that we actually believed in vampires or
werewolves would be a carelessly inclusive
statement rather must it be said that
we were not prepared to deny the possi-
bility of certain unfamiliar and unclassi-
fied modifications of vital force and at-
tenuated matter existing very infrequent-
ly in three-dimensional space because of
its more intimate connection with other
spatial units yet close enough to the
boundary of our own to furnish us oc-
casional manifestations which we for
lack of a proper vantage-point may never
hope to understand

  in short it seemed to my uncle and


weird tales

me that an incontrovertible array of facts
pointed to some lingering influence in the
shunned house traceable to one or an-
other of the ill-favored french settlers of
two centuries before and still operative
through rare and unknown laws of
atomic and electronic motion that the
family of roulet had possessed an ab-
normal affinity for outer circles of entity
-dark spheres which for normal folk
hold only repulsion and terror-their re-
corded history seemed to prove had not
then the riots of those bygone seventeen-
thirties set moving certain kinetic patterns
in the morbid brain of one or more of
them-notably the sinister paul roulet-
which obscurely survived the bodies mur-
dered and buried by the mob and con-
tinued to function in some multiple-
dimensioned space along the original
lines of force determined by a frantic
hatred of the encroaching community

  such a thing was surely not a physical
or biochemical impossibility in the light
of a newer science which includes the
theories of relativity and intra-atomic
action one might easily imagine an alien
nucleus of substance or energy formless
or otherwise kept alive by imperceptible
or immaterial subtractions from the life-
force or bodily tissue and fluids of other
and more palpably living things into
which it penetrates and with whose fabric
it sometimes completely merges itself it
might be actively hostile or it might be
dictated merely by blind motives of self-
preservation in any case such a monster
must of necessity be in our scheme of
things an anomaly and an intruder
whose extirpation forms a primary duty
with every man not an enemy to the
worlds life health and sanity

  what baffled us was our utter igno-
rance of the aspect in which we might en-
counter the thing no sane person had
ever seen it and few had ever felt it
definitely it might be pure energy-a

form ethereal and outside the realm of
substance-or it might be partly material
some unknown and equivocal mass of
plasticity capable of changing at will to
nebulous approximations of the solid
liquid gaseous or tenuously unparticled
states the anthropomorphic patch of
mold on the floor the form of the yel-
lowish vapor and the curvature of the
tree-roots in some of the old tales all
argued at least a remote and reminiscent
connection witli the human shape but
how representative or permanent that
similarity might be none could say with
any kind of certainty

we had devised two weapons to
fight it a large and specially fitted
crookes tube operated by powerful stor-
age batteries and provided with peculiar
screens and reflectors in case it proved
intangible and opposable only by vigor-
ously destructive ether radiations and a
pair of military flame-throwers of the sort
used in the world war in case it proved
partly material and susceptible of me-
chanical destruction-for like the super-
stitious exeter rustics we were prepared
to burn the things heart out if heart
existed to burn all this aggressive mech-
anism we set in the cellar in positions
carefully arranged with reference to the
cot and chairs and to the spot before the
fireplace where the mold had taken
strange shapes that suggestive patch by
the way was only faintly visible when we
placed our furniture and instruments and
when we returned that evening for the
actual vigil for a moment i half doubted
that i had ever seen it in the more defi-
nitely limned form-but then i thought
of the legends

  our cellar vigil began at ten p m
daylight saving time and as it continued
we found no promise of pertinent devel-
opments a weak filtered glow from the
rain-harassed street-lamps outside and a
the shunned house

feeble phosphorescence from the detest-
able fungi within showed the dripping
stone of the walls from which all traces
of whitewash had vanished the dank
fetid and mildew-tainted hard earth floor
with its obscene fungi die rotting re-
mains of what had been stools chairs and
tables and other more shapeless furni-
ture the heavy planks and massive beams
of the ground floor overhead the de-
crepit plank door leading to bins and
chambers beneath other parts of the
house the crumbling stone staircase with
ruined wooden hand-rail and the crude
and cavernous fireplace of blackened
brick where rusted iron fragments re-
vealed the pastpresence of hooks and-
irons spit crane and a door to the
dutch oven-these things and our aus-
tere cot and camp chairs and the heavy
and intricate destructive machinery we
had brought

  we had as in my own former explor-
ations left die door to the street un-
locked so that a direct and practical path
of escape might lie open in case of
manifestations beyond our power to deal
with it was our idea that our continued
nocturnal presence would call forth what-
ever malign entity lurked there and that
being prepared we could dispose of the
thing with one or the other of our pro-
vided means as soon as we had recognized
and observed it sufficiently how long it
might require to evoke and extinguish
the thing wre had no notion it oc-
curred to us too that our venture was
far from safe for in what strength die
diing might appear no one could tell
but we deemed the game worth the
hazard and embarked on it alone and
unhesitatingly conscious that the seeking
of outside aid wrould only expose us to
ridicule and perhaps defeat our entire
purpose such was our frame of mind as
we talked-far into the night till my
uncles growing drowsiness made me re-

mind him to lie down for his two-hour
sleep

  something like fear chilled me as i
sat there in die small hours alone-i say
alone for one who sits by a sleeper is
indeed alone perhaps more alone dian
he can realize my uncle breathed heav-
ily his deep inhalations and exhalations
accompanied by the rain outside and
punctuated by another nerve - racking
sound of distant dripping water within-
for the house was repulsively damp even
in dry weather and in this storm posi-
tively swamp-like i studied die loose
antique masonry of die walls in the
fungus-light and the feeble rays whidi
stole in from the street tiirough the
screened window and once when the
noisome atmosphere of the place seemed
about to sicken me i opened the door
and looked up and down die street
feasting my eyes on familiar sights and
my nostrils on wholesome air still noth-
ing occurred to reward my watching and
i yawned repeatedly fatigue getting die
better of apprehension

  then the stirring of my uncle in his
sleep attracted my notice he had turned
restlessly on the cot several times during
the latter half of the first hour but now
he was breadiing with unusual irregu-
larity occasionally heaving a sigh whidi
held more dian a few of the qualities of
a choking moan

  i turned my electric flashlight on him
and found his face averted so rising and
crossing to the other side of the cot i
again flashed the light to see if he seemed
in any pain what i saw unnerved me
most surprizingly considering its relative
triviality it must have been merely the
association of any odd circumstance with
the sinister nature of our location and
mission for surely the drcumstance was
not in itself frightful or unnatural it
was merely that my uncles facial expres-
sion disturbed no doubt by the strange


weird tales

dreams which our situation prompted
betrayed considerable agitation and
seemed not at all characteristic of him
his habitual expression was one of kindly
and well-bred calm whereas now a vari-
ety of emotions seemed struggling within
him i think on the whole that it was
this variety which chiefly disturbed me
my uncle as he gasped and tossed in
increasing perturbation and with eyes that
had now started open seemed not one
but many men and suggested a curious
quality of alienage from himself

all at once he commenced to mutter
and i did not like the look of his
mouth and teeth as he spoke the words
were at first indistinguishable and then
-with a tremendous start-i recognized
something about them which filled me
with icy fear till i recalled the breadth
of my uncles education and the inter-
minable translations he had made from
anthropological and antiquarian articles in
the revue des deux mondes for the
venerable elihu whipple was muttering
in french and the few phrases i could
distinguish seemed connected with the
darkest myths he had ever adapted from
the famous paris magazine

  suddenly a perspiration broke out on
the sleepers forehead and he leaped
abruptly up half awake the jumble of
french changed to a cry in english and
the hoarse voice shouted excitedly my
breath my breath then the awakening
became complete and with a subsidence
of facial expression to the normal state
my uncle seized my hand and began to
relate a dream whose nucleus of signifi-
cance i could only surmise with a kind
of awe

  he had he said floated off from a very
ordinary series of dream-pictures into a
scene whose strangeness was related to
nothing he had ever read it was of this
world and yet not of it-a shadowy

geometrical confusion in which could be
seen elements of familiar things in most
unfamiliar and perturbing combinations
there was a suggestion of queerly dis-
ordered pictures superimposed one upon
another an arrangement in which the
essentials of time as well as of space
seemed dissolved and mixed in the most
illogical fashion in this kaleidoscopic
vortex of phantasmal images wrere occa-
sional snap-shots if one might use the
term of singular clearness but unaccount-
able heterogeneity

  once my uncle thought he lay in a
carelessly dug open pit with a crowd of
angry faces framed by straggling locks
and three-cornered hats frowning down
on him again he seemed to be in the
interior of a house-an old house appar-
ently-but the details and inhabitants
were constantly changing and he could
never be certain of the faces or the furni-
ture or even of the room itself since
doors and windows seemed in just as
great a state of flux as the presumably
more mobile objects it was queer-
damnably queer-and my uncle spoke
almost sheepishly as if half expecting
not to be believed when he declared
that of the strange faces many had un-
mistakably borne the features of the
harris family and all the while there
was a personal sensation of choking as
if some pervasive presence had spread
itself through his body and sought to
possess itself of his vital processes

  i shuddered at the thought of those
vital processes worn as they were by
eighty-one years of continuous function-
ing in conflict with unknown forces of
which the youngest and strongest system
might well be afraid but in another
moment reflected that dreams are only
dreams and that these uncomfortable
visions could be at most no more than
my uncles reaction to the investigations

                     w t-
the shunned house



and expectations which had lately filled
our minds to the exclusion of all else

   conversation also soon tended to dis-
pel my sense of strangeness and in time
i yielded to my yawns and took my turn
at slumber my uncle seemed now very
wakeful and welcomed his period of
watching even though the nightmare had
aroused him far ahead of his alotted two
hours

  sleep seized me quickly and i was at
once haunted with dreams of the most
disturbing kind i felt in my visions a
cosmic and abysmal loneness with hos-
tility surging from all sides upon some
prison where i lay confined i seemed
bound and gagged and taunted by the
echoing yells of distant multitudes who
thirsted for my blood my uncles face
came to me with less pleasant association
than in waking hours and i recall many
futile struggles and attempts to scream
it was not a pleasant sleep and for a
second i was not sorry for the echoing
shriek which clove through the barriers
of dream and flung me to a sharp and
startled awakeness in which every actual
object before my eyes stood out with
more than natural clearness and reality



i had been lying with my face away
from my uncles chair so that in this
sudden flash of awakening i saw
only the door to the street the win-
dow and the wall and floor and ceil-
ing toward the north of the room all
photographed with morbid vividness on
my brain in a light brighter than the
glow of the fungi or the rays from the
street outside it was not a strong or
even a fairly strong light certainly not
nearly strong enough to read an average
book by but it cast a shadow of myself
and the cot on the floor and had a
yellowish penetrating force that hinted
 w t-

at tilings more potent than luminosity
this i perceived with unhealthy sharp-
ness despite the fact that two of my other
senses were violently assailed for on my
ears rang the reverberations of that
shocking scream while my nostrils re-
volted at the stendi which filled the
place my mind as alert as my senses
recognized the gravely unusual and al-
most automatically i leaped up and turned
about to grasp the destructive instru-
ments which we had left trained on the
moldy spot before the fireplace as i
turned i dreaded what i was to see for
the scream had been in my uncles voice
and i knew not against what menace i
should have to defend him and myself

  yet after all the sight was worse than
i had dreaded there are horrors beyond
horrors and this was one of those nuclei
of all dreamable hideousness which the
cosmos saves to blast an accursed and un-
happy few out of the fungus-ridden
earth steamed up a vaporous corpse-light
yellow and diseased which bubbled and
lapped to a gigantic height in vague out-
lines half human and half monstrous
through which i could see the chimney
and fireplace beyond it was all eyes-
wolfish and mocking - and the rugose
inscct-likc head dissolved at the top to a
thin stream of mist which curled putridly
about and finally vanished up the chim-
ney i say that i saw this thing but it is
only in conscious retrospection that i ever
definitely traced its damnable approach to
form at the time it was to me only a
seetliing dimly phosphorescent cloud of
fungous loathsomeness enveloping and
dissolving to an abhorrent plasticity the
one object on which all my attention was
focussed that object was my uncle-
the venerable elihu whipple-who with
blackening and decaying features leered
and gibbered at me and reached out
dripping claws to rend me in the fury
which this horror had brought


weird tales

  it was a sense of routine which kept
me from going mad i had drilled my-
self in preparation for the crucial mo-
ment and blind training saved me rec-
ognizing the bubbling evil as no sub-
stance reachable by matter or material
chemistry and therefore ignoring the
flame-thrower which loomed on my left
i threw on the current of the crookes
tube apparatus and focussed toward that
scene of immortal blasphemousness the
strongest ether radiations which mans
art can arouse from the spaces and fluids
of nature there was a bluish haze and
a frenzied sputtering and the yellowish
phosphorescence grew dimmer to my eyes
but i saw the dimness was only that of
contrast and that the waves from the
machine had no effect whatever

  then in the midst of that demoniac
spectacle i saw a fresh horror which
brought cries to my lips and sent me
fumbling and staggering toward that un-
locked door to the quiet street careless
of what abnormal terrors i loosed upon
the world or what thoughts or judg-
ments of men i brought down upon my
head in that dim blend of blue and
yellow the form of my uncle had com-
menced a nauseous liquefaction whose
essence eludes all description and in
whidi there played across his vanishing
face such changes of identity as only
madness can conceive he was at once
a devil and a multitude a charnel-house
and a pageant lit by the mixed and un-
certain beams that gelatinous face as-
sumed a dozen-a score-a hundred-
aspects grinning as it sank to the ground
on a body that melted like tallow in the
caricatured likeness of legions strange
and yet not strange

  i saw the features of the harris line
masculine and feminine adult and infan-
tile and other features old and young
coarse and refined familiar and unfa-
miliar for a second there flashed a

degraded counterfeit of a miniature of
poor mad rhoby harris that i had seen
in the school of design museum and
another time i thought i caught the raw-
boned image of mercy dexter as i re-
called her from a painting in carring-
ton harriss house it was frightful be-
yond conception toward the last when
a curious blend of servant and baby
visages flickered close to the fungous floor
where a pool of greenish grease was
spreading it seemed as though the shift-
ing features fought against themselves
and strove to form contours like those 
of my uncles kindly face i like to think
that he existed at that moment and that
he tried to bid me farewell it seems to
me i hiccupped a farewell from my own
parched throat as i lurched out into the
street a thin stream of grease following
me through the door to the rain-
drenched sidewalk

the rest is shadowy and monstrous
there was no one in the soaking
street and in all the world there was no
one i dared tell i walked aimlessly south
past college hill and the athenaeum
down hopkins street and over the bridge
to the business section where tall build-
ings seemed to guard me as modern
material things guard the world from
ancient and unwholesome wonder then
gray dawn unfolded wetly from the east
silhouetting the archaic hill and its vener-
able steeples and beckoning me to the
place where my terrible work was still
unfinished and in the end i went wet
hatless and dazed in the morning light
and entered that awful door in benefit
street which i had left ajar and which
still swung cryptically in full sight of the
early householders to whom i dared not
speak

  the grease was gone for the moldy
floor was porous and in front of the
fireplace was no vestige of the giant dou-
the shunned house



bled-up form traced in niter i looked
at the cot the chairs the instruments my
neglected hat and the yellowed straw hat
of my uncle dazedness was uppermost
and i could scarcely recall what was
dream and what was reality then
thought trickled back and i knew that i
had witnessed things more horrible than
i had dreamed

  sitting down i tried to conjecture as
nearly as sanity would let me just what
had happened and how i might end the
horror if indeed it had been real matter
it seemed not to be nor ether nor any-
thing else conceivable by mortal mind
what then but some exotic emanation
some vampirish vapor such as exeter
rustics tell of as lurking over certain
churchyards this i felt was the clue
and again i looked at the floor before
the fireplace where the mold and niter
had taken strange forms

  in ten minutes my mind was made up
and taking my hat i set out for home
where i bathed ate and gave by tele-
phone an order for a pickax a spade a
military gas-mask and six carboys of
sulfuric acid all to be delivered the next
morning at the cellar door of the shunned
house in benefit street after that i tried
to sleep and failing passed the hours in
reading and in the composition of inane
verses to counteract my mood

  at eleven a m the next day i com-
menced digging it was sunny weather
and i was glad of that i was still alone
for as much as i feared the unknown
horror i sought there was more fear in
the thought of telling anybody later i
told harris only through sheer necessity
and because he had heard odd tales from
old people which disposed him ever so
little toward belief as i turned up the
stinking black earth in front of the fire-
place my spade causing a viscous yellow
ichor to ooze from die white fungi whidi

it severed i trembled at the dubious
thoughts of what i might uncover some
secrets of inner earth are not good for
mankind and this seemed to me one of
them

  my hand shook perceptibly but still i
delved after a while standing in the
large hole i had made with the deep-
ening of the hole which was about six
feet square the evil smell increased and
i lost all doubt of my imminent contact
with the hellish thing whose emanations
had cursed die house for over a century
and a half i wondered what it would
look like-what its form and substance
would be and how big it might have
waxed through long ages of life-sucking
at length i climbed out of the hole and
dispersed the heaped-up dirt then arrang-
ing the great carboys of acid around and
near two sides so that when necessary
i might empty them all down the aperture
in quick succession after that i dumped
earth only along the other two sides
working more slowly and donning my
gas-mask as die smell grew i was nearly
unnerved at my proximity to a nameless
thing at the bottom of a pit

  suddenly my spade struck something
softer than earth i shuddered and made
a motion as if to climb out of the hole
which was now as deep as my neck then
courage returned and i scraped away
more dirt in the light of the electric
tordi i had provided the surface i un-
covered was fishy and glassy-a kind of
semi-putrid congealed jelly with sugges-
tions of translucency i scraped further
and saw that it had form there was a
rift where a part of the substance was
folded over the exposed area was huge
and roughly cylindrical like a mammoth
soft blue-white stovepipe doubled in two
its largest part some two feet in diameter
still more i scraped and then abruptly i

leaped out of the hole and away from the
filthy thing frantically unstopping and
tilting the heavy carboys and precipitat-
ing their corrosive contents one after an-
other down that charnel gulf and upon
the unthinkable abnormality whose titan
elbow i had seen

the blinding maelstrom of greenish-
yellow vapor which surged tempestu-
ously up from that hole as the floods of
acid descended will never leave my
memory all along the hill people tell of
the yellow day when virulent and hor-
rible fumes arose from the factory waste
dumped in the providence river but i
know how mistaken they are as to the
source they tell too of the hideous
roar which at the same time came from
some disordered water-pipe or gas main
underground-but again i could correct
them if i dared it was unspeakably
shocking and i do not see how i lived
through it i did faint after emptying
the fourth carboy which i had to handle
after the fumes had began to penetrate
my mask but when i recovered i saw
that the hole was emitting no fresh
vapors

  the two remaining carboys i emptied
down without particular result and after
a time i felt it safe to shovel the earth
back into the pit it was twilight before
t was done but fear had gone out of the
place the dampness was less fetid and
all the strange fungi had withered to a
kind of harmless grayish powder which
blew ash-like along the floor one of
earths nethermost terrors had perished
for ever and if there be a hell it had
received at last the demon soul of an
unhallowed thing and as i patted down
the last spadeful of mold i shed the
first of the many tears with which i have
paid unaffected tribute to my beloved
uncles memory

  the next spring no more pale grass
and strange weeds came up in the shunned
houses terraced garden and shortly after-
ward carrington harris rented the place
it is still spectral but its strangeness
fascinates me and i shall find mixed with
my relief a queer regret when it is torn
down to make way for a tawdry shop or
vulgar apartment building the barren
old trees in the yard have begun to bear
small sweet apples and last year the
birds nested in their gnarled boughs

omicidal diary

by earl peirce jr

what strange compulsion drove an ordinarily gentle and cultured man on one
night of each week to roam the city streets and
commit a ghastly crime

i am writing this account of my
friend jason carse in the interests of
both justice and psychiatry and per-
haps of demonology as well there is no
greater proof of what i relate than the
sequence of murders which so recently

shocked this city the newspaper items re-
garding the crimes and especially the
official report of the alienists who exam-
ined carse during his trial i cannot ex-
pect to bring doctor carse back to life
for he was hanged until dead but i do

                                    


weird tales

hope that this paper will offer new il-
lumination on cases of criminal decapi-
tation

  justice and psychiatry are closely re-
lated but it is difficult to recognize the
judicial importance of so outre a subject
as demonology yet i emphatically assert
that the case of jason carse is irrevocably
concerned with evil and dark lore such as
mankind has not known since the holy
inquisition

  one is naturally prejudiced against
carse for even i myself his lifelong ac-
quaintance was struck with repugnance
when i first realized the nature of his
activities but his death on the gallows
should foreclose biased reflection and
permit the student to regard his case in a
purely empirical light as i am the only
man in complete possession of the facts
it behooves me to give this astounding
information to the world

  jason carse was a brilliant and respect-
ed criminologist and at the time of his
arrest he was recognized as one of the
greatest students of the modern world a
fact which has made his case one of un-
paralleled notoriety i was his roommate
during the several years we spent in law
school and although he shot to the pin-
nacle of his branch of jurisprudence while
i was left to more prosaic routine we
never lost the contact which has now be-
come so valuable our correspondence
was frequent and regular since we were
graduated and i can say with justifiable
pride that carse respected my friendship
as much as that of any other acquaint-
ance if not more it was this intimacy
with his personal life which has enabled
me as friend and confidant to witness
the revolting atavism which resulted in
such outrageous crimes

  i obtained my first hazy acquaintance
with the crimes three months ago when
i received carses letter from vienna he

had just discovered sensational evidence
in a famous criminal case-one of recur-
rent human decapitation-and his conse-
quent enthusiasm was so rabid that i was
afraid the morbidity of such matters was
beginning to pervert his senses for sev-
eral years i had become progressively
aware of carses melancholic attitude and
i had often recommended that he take a
vacation from criminal cases his indefat-
igable enthusiasm for research was all
against my advice and he had gone re
lentlessly ahead to the tragic climax
which my greatest fears could not have
imagined this letter from vienna so
eager with indomitable il faut travailler
confirmed my suspicion that carse had
descended into the depressing rut of
monomania

  when he returned to america shortly
afterward i crossed the country to spend
a few days with him but he was so sickly
and irritable that i could do nothing to
cheer his spirits he continually brooded
over the case he had been investigating
and i should have known at that time
there was a dangerous neurotic compul-
sion stirring in his subconscious mind

  less than a week after my departure
from the city the first of the horrific head-
hunting crimes was committed and the
actual drama got under way i can re-
call reading the sensational accounts in
the newspapers and my anxious fear that
this fresh display of criminal perversion
would excite carse into a state nearing
hysteria i telegraphed him that same
day begging his refusal to bother with
the case and requesting that he come to
visit me his reply was swift and brief
he had already commenced his investi-
gations of the head-hunting crime and
nothing on earth could deter him from
his set course knowing him as i did i
could do nothing but hope that the head-
hunter would be swiftly captured and the
case brought to a finish it was an un-
the homicidal diary



pleasant shock therefore when i read-
exactly one week later-that a second and
identical crime had been committed

even in my own city three thousand
miles from the center of the crimes
there was wild confusion at the announce-
ment of this second spectacular murder
the reader may recall the international
effects of the infamous ripper crimes
which terrified london a few decades
ago and he will understand how rapidly
the head-hunters fame spread through
crime-conscious america both murders
were made particularly mysterious be-
cause of the disappearance of the victims
heads i knew the damaging influence
which these doings would produce upon
carse for he had always been interested
in decapitations and his thesis at the
university of graz had been based upon
the mad career of emil drukker the
head-hunter of cologne

  i wrote again to carse and begged him
to abandon his studies in these new mur-
ders but as before his response was cold
and discouraging there was a wild and
almost fanatical tone in his letter which
was indicative of his obsessed mind and
an ugly premonition occurred to me that
this would be the breaking-point of his
career

  the third and fourth murders so hor-
ribly identical with the first two came
about at weekly intervals and the city
was in the grip of strangling terror
there was no rime or reason for the
crimes and yet the diabolical precision of
the murderer seemed to indicate he was a
madman of uncanny intelligence in all
four cases his victims were vagabonds and
people of the lowest order in none of
the murders had the victim been as-
saulted but the head had disappeared
seemingly for ever there was not a
shred of evidence pointing to the solu-
tion and except that the police knew

him to be a homicidal maniac there was
not a single person in a city of several
millions whom they could call the mur-
derer far worse than the four murders
committed was the belief that they would
continue week after week to an indeter-
minable conclusion

  i left for the city by plane on the eve-
ning of the discovery of the fifth victim
and during the trans-country flight i read
carses own statement in the metropoli-
tan gazette citing the crime as an atavis-
tic expression of animalism the fact
that two of the five victims had been
men according to carses theory belied
the popular suspicion that the criminal
was a homicidal sadist carse expressed
the belief that the murderer was in the
grip of some inherent savagery and that
the ghastly murders would continue until
he wore himself out by the sheer expen-
diture of energy

  i reached the city shortly after sun-
down and at once i felt the awful tension
which had settled upon everyone in it
men and women moved furtively air-
port officials and police examined every
strange face with cold and scrutinizing
suspicion and even my taxi-driver a
small mousy man kept his fear-laden
dark eyes continually reverting to the
mirror as he whirled me through the
slight evening traffic i was surprized
therefore in view of this mutual distrust
to find that jason carse a veteran crimi-
nalist had discharged all of his servants
and was living alone in his grim house
behind a barricaded door

  the most unpleasant shock was the un-
accountably cold manner in which carse
received my visit and his positive annoy-
ance that i had forced myself so unex-
pectedly upon him he would not ex-
plain why he had discharged his servants
nor the secluded life he was now leading
but there was little difficulty in realizing
the fatiguing effects which these recent


weird tales

crimes had pronounced upon him he
was virtually a stranger as we met in the
hallway and shook hands

  i wish youd go to a hotel he said
bluntly i dont want anyone here

  but i didnt go to a hotel i told him
flatly that there was no other course open
to me but to stay and take care of him
for obviously he wasnt taking care of
himself and his dismissal of the house-
hold help had precipitated a needless bur-
den on his already over-laden shoulders
he needed food for he was thin to ema-
ciation and i made him dress at once and
accompany me to a restaurant where i
saw that he ate a decent meal i then led
him to the theater a particularly lively
musical comedy and kept him in his seat
until the curtain had fallen but my ef-
forts seemed of no avail as he was con-
tinually depressed and absorbed in his
own reflections that night before retir-
ing he came to my room and again asked
me to leave

  its for your own good he said with
strange harshness for gods sake be-
lieve what i say

for the next several days i watched
him sink lower and lower into de-
spondency of so contagious a nature that
i felt the insufferable pangs of it myself
he worked late at night on the murder
cases referring constantly to autopsy pro-
tocols and police memoranda and more
than once i saw him reading his bible
on several occasions he visited the county
morgue and examined the remains of the
head-hunters victims and following
each such visit he lapsed into a state of
mental and physical agitation that ex-
hausted him widiin a few hours

  the nights were almost unbearable
and i would lie awake for hours listening
to the mumbles and moans which came
from his room oftentimes distinguishing
such words as god forbid it god forbid

it and frequently he would scream the
word head-hunter there was no
doubt that carse had delved too deeply
into this case and that hour by hour he
was descending into the clutch of a dan-
gerous neurosis

  during my stay with him i engaged
several servants but he discharged them
and i was unable to reconcile him to my
point of view his resentment of my visit
became more acute as the days passed
and i was beginning to fear that he would
forcibly eject me

  it was easy to explain this increased
irritability for i myself as well as every
soul in the city w-as nen-ously awaiting
the next prowl of the head-hunter and
in it i recognized more fuel for the fire
that wras burning carses reason he wras
waiting for the fatal monday night as a
man waits for his doom and each hour
found him closer to a mental attack on
sunday afternoon i discovered him in my
room packing my luggage

  you must go now he said  ap-
preciate your interest in me but now you
must go-you must

  the tremor of anxiety in his voice
nearly convinced me that he was right
but doggedly i clung to my set purpose to
save him in spite of himself i could not
leave him alone in face of the develop-
ments which would occur sometime be-
tween then and tuesday morning and
i told him so

  fool he exploded i can do noth-
ing with you stay if you wish-but its
on your own head

  the irony of that final statement
whether intentional or not is something
i shall remember to my grave i dont
think that carse meant it literally-on
my own head-but i was unable to shake
his words out of my ears and through-
out the night and the following day they
hung about me like a dirge

  carse did not sleep at all that sunday
the homicidal diary



night but paced up and down in his
study while a fierce alarming expression
hardened on his features nor could i
sleep for his continued pacing tore my
nerves to shreds and i spent the night
alternately in my own room and at the
partly open doorway of the library where
i was able to watch him in secrecy sev-
eral times i saw him bend over a small
book and study it with the intent regard
of a disciple and each time that he re-
ferred to a certain page he pounded his
fist on the desk and cried to himself
god forbid god forbid

  i should have realized what he meant
i should have known and been prepared
but how blind my friendship made me to
the horrific implication of those repeated
words

  monday came and went in a slow driz-
zle of rain which only added to the
somber quiet of the city and as the eve-
ning approached and wore on i felt my-
self caught in the irresistible tide of fear-
ful anticipation which warned of the
sixth appearance of the head-hunter the
streets were deserted throughout the day
and with but few exceptions the only
pedestrians were police officers who now
traveled in pairs or squads the evening
papers were brutally frank in predicting
that before dawn a sixth headless corpse
would be discovered and this expecta-
tion was shared by all

  carse was at home all day and refused
to answer the telephone or to allow me
to answer it for him he ate sparingly
with his same preoccupation and con-
trary to my expectations he appeared to
have lapsed into a state akin to normal-
ity like a man who contemplates a pre-
ordained and inexorable occurrence

  at six oclock he came to me ghastly
haggard and thin and again asked me to
leave his house but i refused this zero-
hour request he shrugged and went
back to his study i watched him for a

while and saw that he was studying that
queer little book which so deeply affected
him and i again heard him utter those
despairing words god forbid god
forbid

i went to bed at a little after ten and
tried to sleep but the city-wide ex-
citement seeped into my room and kept
me tossing from the thrusts of night-
mares at midnight carse came up and
stopped just outside my door obviously
listening to determine whether i was
asleep the silence was uncanny for a
moment then i heard a sharp metallic
clicking and he went on to his room
after he had closed his door i swept my
sheet aside and went to my own door
carse had locked it from the outside

  i called to him for an explanation of
this conduct but he either didnt hear me
or chose to ignore my requests for the
house remained grimly silent returning
to bed i managed somehow to doze off

  at two oclock i was awakened by the
sound of someones walking in the hall-
way i sat bolt-upright in bed and heard
the unmistakable approach of footsteps
coming down the corridor from carses
bedroom the tread was stealthy and de-
termined and as it drew closer to my
room i was conscious of a cold mask of
sweat clinging to my face because the
footsteps did not sound like those of
jason carse

  the feeling hit me and hit me again
until t was left stunned with the horror
of it it did not sound like carse but
if it was not carse who was it

  i wanted to call out his name yet i
felt with some indefinable sense that
the treader in the hall was unaware that
i was in the house and for that reason it
could not have been carse i was afraid
to make an outcry and i sat stricken with
dread as the footsteps went past my door
descending the stairs a moment later


weird tales

there was a noise of cutlery being moved
in the kitchen and the front door opened
and closed

  as it had come that strange prescience
vanished and i tried to reason out what
i had heard of course the man was
carse who could it have been save him
for were we not alone in the house i sat
for hours on the bed working up a deter-
mination to shake the truth out of him
when he returned but shortly after four
oclock my strength ran out of me and i
shook with fear as i heard that awful
ghost-like tread ascending the stairs
my heart beat wildly when the person
reached my door and twisted the knob to
enter

  one thought flashed through my head
thank god the door was locked the
terrible feeling that it was not carse came
back upon me and i sat motionless as i
listened to the sounds from outside for
a moment there were no sounds from the
intruder but i did hear a faint tap-tap-
tap like that of a liquid falling to the
wooden floor in a minute the knob was
released and the footsteps continued
down the hall to carscs room

  any attempt to explain my thoughts as
i sat smoking throughout the night would
only add to the confusion of these rev-
elations they were not sane and rational
thoughts but rather strange suggestions
and premonitions i thought myself to
be in the presence of a tremendous evil

  in the morning carse was up early
and moved back and forth in the corri-
dor with strange industry he was cry-
ing for his sobs came disturbingly to my
ears and once i heard him descend into
the cellar and there was a faint digging
sound as he performed some outlandish
task then i heard him in the hallway
and on the stairs i heard the splashing
of water and the sound of scrubbing

  i pounded on the door for him to let
me out but it was not until nearly noon

tiiat he finished his chores and finally
opened my door he was stooped and
fatigued and without bothering to return
my amenities he turned away and went
to his study

i went into the hallway and noticed as
i had surmised that the floor showed
signs of recent and vigorous cleaning i
walked down to his room and looked in
not surprized to notice that here too was
the unmistakable evidence of scrubbing
i knew there was only one more thing to
do i must go down to the cellar and un-
earth what he had buried there

  the horrible truth had been dawning
upon me for hours and when i came
face to face with him in the kitchen at
the head of the cellar stairs i looked
squarely into his eyes with the full real-
ization that jason carse was the head-
hunter

  i was not frightened-not for my per-
sonal safety at any rate-but a sensation
of sickening horror went through
me as i looked into his tired face and
understood that at last he had fallen into
the cesspool which had tormented him
since early years the words of the coro-
ner came back into my ears he is a
madman of uncanny intelligence and i
knew that he knew i rccognized him for
what he was

  the awful silence of our conflicting
glances was unbroken for several seconds
and then words came uncontrollably from
my mouth and i managed to snap that
nerve-cracking tension

  whats in the cellar i cried what
have you buried there

  if any tiling happens to you he re-
turned ignoring my questions i am not
to be blamed i warned you in time to
get away from this house what do you
think is in the cellar

  i dare to suggest there are six small
graves
the homicidal diary



  an ugly smirk went across his face and
he cast a glance at the cellar door

  you always were too smart for your
own good he said softly knowledge
can be dangerous

  how did you think you could get
away with it i screamed only too well
aware of his implication my god
carse six human heads

  his jaw hardened and he took a men-
acing step toward me then suddenly
he stopped a queer tragic expression com-
ing over his face he put his hand to
his eyes as if to blot out some horrible
memory

  i know i know he cried hysteri-
cally six heads-six human heads do
you think i planned six heads

  a shudder went through him and he
buried his face in both hands and sobbed
like a child

  my personal fear gradually subsided as
i watched this remorseful quiescence
which had come upon him i realized
that he had passed the emotional climax
of his crime and that he was now suffer-
ing that terrible reaction which must
haunt and terrify all criminals i took
this advantage to gain control of him for
there was no way of determining when
his madness would flare again

  there is only one course open for
me i told him soberly i must turn
you over to the police things like this
must be stopped

  he pulled his hands away from his
face and stared at me his eyes fired with
dread no no he screamed dont
give me away please in the name of
god dont give me away i am sick i
tell you i am not responsible

  a feeling of helpless pity went through
me as he sank to his knees in hysterical
imploration but i steeled myself against
him the man was mad and dangerous

he must be stamped out without mercy

  there are asylums- i began

  you cannot he cried you know
what they do in asylums  know please
help me i am not responsible it is the
book-the book

  what book

  drukker-that diary cant you see
what it has done to me its eaten into
my brain until i am mad its driven me
like a slave until i have no other bidding
it taught me how to do these things it
makes me do them

  i pulled him to his feet and shook him
unmercifully he was crying and retch-
ing a pitiable and horrible sight to look
upon

   you are talking irrationally i cried
i am your friend and i want to help you
but my first duty is the public welfare
there are six human heads buried in your
cellar there must be no more

  no more he laughed shrilly and
threw up both his hands to indicate the
count of ten no more you say there
will be ten more before it stops ten
more thats what the book says

  you want ten i demanded incred-
ulously struck numb by his callousness
you want ten more to add to those six
carse carse they are not cabbages you
are counting they are human heads do
you think i am a fiend to let this con-
tinue no it must end-it must end on
the gallows

  he died on the gallows

  he whom are you talking about
try to make sense carse i am your
friend trust me

  i am talking of emil drukker-the
man who taught me how to do these
things he is responsible for them not
i he is the one to hang for them dig
him out of his grave and hang him
again


weird tales

i pushed him gently into a chair for
his collapse seemed imminent spittle
was running from his mouth and his
retching continued in spasms that shook
him to his teeth

  i am your friend i told him again
i want to help you but you must get
control of yourself why do you say you
are not responsible what drove you to
commit these crimes

  he looked at me searchingly and his
eyes cleared he swallowed a mass of
incoherent words in an effort to master
himself then his hand pressed over mine

  you are right i must get control of
myself he said i have done some hor-
rible tilings which can never be forgiven
but i swear to you that i have not done
them intentionally and i am not mad as
you think i am in the power of that
book i am the puppet of a horror that
has outlived all natural deaths

  a feeling of relief passed over me as
i saw him settle into a state of rational
observation i hoped it would last for
not three yards away from him lying on
top of the kitchen table was a seven-inch
butcher knife my only hope was to pre-
serve his state by permitting him to tell
his story and in that way to persuade
him to accept the inevitable consequences
of his crimes i drew up a chair beside
his own yet kept myself alert to ward
off any lunge he might make for the
knife

  what is this horror which has mas-
tered you i asked in an effort to gain
his confidence and what is this book
i told you about it in my letter from
vienna six weeks ago i told you i had
discovered a rare book-an awful and
compelling book it was the diary of
emil drukker

  where did you get it

  he cast a swift glance about the room
then suddenly his eyes fell upon the
butcher knife i saw him tense saw his

lips twitch under the lash of a horrible
temptation

   carse tell me about it i yelled to
distract him where did you get the
book

   he pulled his eyes away from the knife
and let them burn into my face for a
moment undecided he was silent then
his brows straightened and he leaned for-
ward in his chair

  do you remember my graz thesis it
was based upon the life of emil drukker
in an effort to explain what impulse drove
him to cut off human heads it was a
good thesis one of the best on the sub-
ject and it brought a lot of response from
criminologists all over the world about
six months after it was published i re-
ceived a letter from a man who was once
emil drukkers personal servant he was
living in cologne right close to the old
drukker castle and he wanted to see me
he told me that he knew the drukker
crimes from the first to the last-sixteen
of them

  so i went of course and met this
man who was small and old with an ob-
session for emil drukker he talked for
a long time and then he handed me the
diary and said it explained more vividly
than i could ever imagine the impulse
which prompted drukkers recurrent hu-
man decapitations he told me that
drukker had written each entry while the
memory of the crime was still fresh in his
mind it was a terrible book to read he
warned and unless i had the intellectual
strength of a mental hercules i would
never forgive myself for having opened it

  naturally i was too excited to heed
his warning and on that same night i
took the book away with me i promised
to return it to him when i had finished
but he wouldnt accept this plan instead
he said that he would come and get the
book when i was through it was a mys-
terious business and should have told me
the homicidal diary



to expect no good to come of it i asked
him how he would know when i had fin-
ished with the book and i shall never
forget that evil smile and disdainful
shrug of his response

   i shall know well enough when i
read the newspapers he told me this
time it will be six or seven-in about four
months from now

  do you understand what he meant
by those words he knew what would
happen and yet he let me carry that
book away with me in the name of
god what kind of a man is he

  why didnt you destroy the book
i demanded of him

   i couldnt it was too fascinating too
powerful to destroy i read that book
with the reverence of an ecclesiastic until
i knew every word between the covers
and the whole ghastly parade of druk-
kers sixteen murders passed before my
eyes like figures on a stage ten weeks
ago i began to have nightmares that re-
constructed the crimes of drukker going
chronologically from number one to
number sixteen then beginning all over
again

  when i returned to america seven
weeks ago i still had the book with me
and the contents were so deeply engraved
on my brain that i could think of nothing
else day and night i thought about it
until at length i found myself actually
imagining how i would go about emu-
lating his crimes then i began to get
the horrible impulse to fondle a butcher
knife-drukker used a butcher knife you
know-and more than once i was struck
with the scarcely resistible urge to cut off
someones head it didnt matter whose
head-but just a head

  easy carse i cried with a wary
glance at the kitchen table tell me the
rest but dont excite yourself what hap-
pened then

he slid back in a sort of stupor
shook his head several times then
passed his hand across his eyes in a ges-
ture of despair

  you ought to know damned well
what happened if you were listening at
your door last night six weeks ago i
went to bed and dreamed horribly i
had just finished reading the first confes-
sion in the diary-some strange impulse
made me read that confession and no
other-and in my sleep i saw a human
head staring at me it was a cruel teu-
tonic head and i knew that it was emil
drukkers head hanging in a gallows
rope then he smiled at me a horrible
vivid real smile and the head vanished
from then on for how long i cannot say
i sat as a spectator and watched the com-
plete action of drukkers number one

  i saw drukker leave his house and
walk down a dark street with no other
illumination than a few scattered electric
lights i tried to imagine how they were
electric lights for they had only gas in
his day but nevertheless they were mod-
ern lights and the street looked like the
street in front of my own house he
walked about ten blocks then he saw a
woman standing on a street corner
there wasnt another soul in sight he
crept closer to her then drew out his
butcher knifi and hid it in the folds of
his coat-a coat which looked strangely
like my own wind-breaker he first tried
to talk with the woman but she was not
interested so he pulled out the knife and
brought it sweeping down across her
throat the blood spurted like a foun-
tain and overran drukkers hand but he
only laughed and pushed the woman to
the ground then knelt over her and be-
gan a horrible sawing movement with
his knife when he had finished he
drew a towel from his pocket and
wrapped the head tightly to prevent the
blood from trailing him home he came


weird tales

back the same way and entered the house
and at the foot of the stairs he unwrapped
the towel and held the thing only by its
hair as he climbed the steps the last
thing i saw or heard was the blood drip-
ping on each step as he ascended to the
upper hall

  my god i whispered in horror

  but thats not the worst carse cried
as he grabbed my arm when i awak-
ened the next morning it was late and the
shrieks of the newsboys stabbed into my
ears they were yelling about a cruel
brutal murder which had been committed
sometime during the night i swung my
feet off the bed to arise when my eyes
fell upon the diary which rested on my
night-table it was open to the confes-
sion of number one as if i had been
reading it in my sleep there was a
strange and terrifying dread in my soul
as my feet struck the floor i felt some-
thing wet and sticky touch my toes then
i looked down it was a womans head
staring up at me

  the room was smeared with blood
from one end to the other and there was
a gore-caked knife resting beside the
head and a crimson towel lay across my
bedpost but there wasnt a drop of blood
on my hands

   couldnt even attempt to explain it
i only knew that a woman hd been mur-
dered and that her severed head was in
my bedroom i didnt know what to do
i couldnt force myself into the belief that
i was the murderer and i stood stunned
with the weird horror of knowing that
emil drukkers number one had been
re-enacted and that i had played his own
role where could i turn whom could
i ask for advice if i was mad they
would commit me to an asylum if i was
not mad they would hang me

  i carried the head to the cellar and
buried it then i cleaned up the blood
and burned the towel in my wardrobe i

found a suit of clothes smeared with fresh
blood i found my shoes and hat splat-
tered with it and then i found my dis-
carded gloves stained a violent crimson
with each finger stiffened as the blood
had coagulated about it no wonder
there wasnt any blood on my hands

  i went over the house from top to
bottom and eradicated every stain that
might be evidence against me then i sat
down with the diary in one hand and
the morning newspaper in the other i
compared the two crimes they were
identical even to the burying of the
heads emil drukker had done exactly
the same as i had done he carried the
head in a towel he left it in his room over-
night he buried it in his cellar and he
cleaned up the blood the following morn-
ing but there was one ghastly differ-
ence emil drukker had committed his
crime with full purposeful foreknowl-
edge whereas i had committed my crime
under hypnotic inducement

  there is no other answer for what
has happened in these last six weeks i
have racked my brain to find another so-
lution but there is none i am being
hypnotized by some unexplainable force
and once each week i come under the
power of this evil which directs and com-
mands my being last night i went to
bed with the full knowledge of what
would occur during the night that is
why i locked you in your room this
morning when i awakened i found the
head exactly where the other five had
lain then i carried it to the basement and
buried it i cleaned up the blood and
burned the towel

  if you are numbed with horror try to
imagine how i feel about it six crimes
in six weeks and i can only thank mer-
ciful god that it will end with only one
more perhaps it is ended now that
german servant who loaned me the diary
said it would be only six or seven
the homicidal diary



  do you think the police will believe
all of this i demanded what you
have told me has no sane explanation
it-its demonism

carse smiled pitiably there are
more things in heaven and earth
he began then he heaved his shoulders
as if flinging off an attempt at levity
the human mind is a strange organ
and no man can explain its mysteries i
have seen too much of atavism to ridi-
cule any theories there is nothing we
can do but wait and hope that the ger-
man servants prediction is true six or
seven six-or seven

  do you mean you expect me to grant
you leniency i exclaimed great heav-
ens carse there have been six horrible
murders society demands a reckoning
i have atoned enough for ten times
six he cried have you no soul in you
the crimes will stop now the german
said they would and everything else he
predicted has come true as my lifelong
friend it is your duty to see me through

  but those six-

  no man can bring them back to life
but i am still a living man and you must
save me i shall divide my estate among
the families of the six and i swear to
you that i shall never open a book on
criminology again you must do it-you
must

  do you honestly believe it is over
i asked hoarsely

  i do with all my heart and soul i
do

  but you would say that anyway i
cried suppose there is a number
seven the blood will be upon my hands
as well as yours it is an awful respon-
sibility carse there must be no more
there wont be i swear there wont
be

  he threw himself at me in an hysteri-

cal outburst of emotion he tried to
smile through the tears in his eyes but
the sight was so awful that i turned my
head

  i am still unconvinced i said grim-
ly the possibility of number seven is
too important to overlook let me see
drukkers diary

  why he backed away and stared at
me why do you want to read the
diary

  i want to read account number
seven

  carse came forward again and grabbed
my arm he shook it what good will
that do he asked anxiously if there
are only six of them besides its not a
book you ought to read

  give me the diary i demanded
again

  he scowled at me for a moment then
shrugging he reached into his pocket and
withdrew a small leather-bound book it
was well worn as if by many thumbs
and in faded gold letters across the cover
were the words personal diary of emil
drukker j u d

  sit down i commanded and try
to keep your nerves together i shall do
everything i can for you

  he backed away and dropped into a
chair his eyes fastened upon me in a look
of almost majestic joy and yet there was
an undertone in his expression which i
could not define there was defiance
there and fear one of his hands rested
on the near-by table less than two feet
from the hilt of the butcher knife and
the fingers of that hand twitched nerv-
ously

with an odd sense of uneasiness i
flicked open the first several pages
of the book and skimmed through the
contents my german was poor yet i
was able to understand the significance of
what emil drukker had written in his


weird tales

large scrawling hand i read the first
six accounts then stared at carse in
amazement his six crimes and druk-
kers first six were so identical they might
have been conscious reproductions in all
cases the victims were the same sex the
same age and were in the same general
wralk of life i then turned to account
number seven and after reading a few
wretched lines i gasped with horror it
was a seven-year-old girl

  carse was on his feet his jaw grim
and determined he stared fiercely at
me waiting my response

  carse i muttered dazedly it-
it-

  you cant back out he cried as he
stepped toward me there will be no
seven i tell you its ended on six i
swear it to you

  no i said i cannot permit such a
risk did you read account number
seven he not only cut off the head but
he dismembered-

  you cant back out he screamed as
he shook my arm you cant you
cant

  but carse this is a girl-a mere
child dont you realize it would be un-
pardonable even for you no i can
never take such a risk i must turn you
over to the police

  carse slapped me viciously then stum-
bled back against the table his face was
a mask of suffused blood his eyes wild
with desperation

  damn you he cried savagely you
are no friend youre a cheat a betrayer

  suddenly his groping fingers touched
the butcher knife and he drew himself
taut his fingers wound around the hilt
like slowly moving worms for a mo-
ment there was scarcely a breath between
us then he lifted his arm and brought
the knife slowly out before him i
watched horror-stricken unable to lift
my feet from the floor a numbing

paralysis of fright seemed to come over
me

  carse carse i muttered

  he didnt hear me his body was tensed
for the deadly spring that would bring
him down upon my throat i saw a rip-
ple of galvanizing energy race through
his hands then i managed an outcry at
the same instant he was in the air

there is no need for me to relate die
events which followed for the news-
papers had assiduously described the cap-
ture and arrest of carse and his subse-
quent history brief as it was has become
public property to my dying day i shall
carry the five-inch scar along my cheek
where his knife descended upon me and
i can never cease to be thankful for that
one outburst of absolute fear which tore
from my lips and attracted a passing po-
liceman otherwise i might have been
number seven in the grim line of epi-
taphs that marked the close of this fan-
tastic case only by bludgeoning carse
with his stick could the officer overcome
him and it was necessary to keep him in
a straitjacket until the hour of his execu-
tion

   it is a curious fact that the psychiatrists
who examined carse several of them his
former pupils could not find him un-
balanced enough to be irresponsible for
his crimes those long and tiring vigils
in the mental clinic will haunt me for
life there was no end to their searching
and probing of his subconscious mind no
end to the tests and questions the ex-
amination and analyses which ended
hopelessly against him but even if they
had found him insane violently and
homicidally insane they would not have
dared report such a finding to the court
society demanded a death in return for a
death and jason carse was nailed to his
coffin at the first moment of his arrest
had he been spared the gallows by the

                     w t-
the homicidal diary



court he would not have been spared the
gallows by the mobs that milled about the
detention prison for continually through-
out the trial was the grim reminder that
society represented by mobs has not yet
forgotten the use of lynch law

  carses death put a definite end to the
head-hunting crimes in this city and for
the firsl time in over six weeks the met-
ropolitan area has been able to breathe
freely i have lost a faithful and sincere
friend but i lost him not on the gallows
but three mondis ago when he first dis-
covered the diary of emil drukker

  it is the diary not my mourning which
has prompted me to pen this account of
my knowledge of the head-hunting
crimes during the trial as you may re-
member i sought to introduce the diary
as major evidence in support of carses
somnambulistic manias but it was waived
out of court with ridicule and contempt

  one must admit that carses story as he
told it to me and as i later reiterated it
to the court was fantastic and highly im-
probable but there are certain irrefut-
able arguments in support of carses
story wrhich shed a terrible light not
alone upon the case but on all criminal
cases of similar nature for one thing
a hypnotic examination by competent state
alienists was completely unsuccessful in
the attempt to bring forth his subcon-
scious knowledge of any of the six mur-
ders secondly carse was unable despite
his most intense and willing efforts to re-
construct even the smallest part of any
one of the crimes his only acquaintance
with his own alleged activities was
brought to him in dreams

  a further significant fact which the
court ignored as irrelevant was the ghast-
ly identity of carses supposed crimes and
those confessed by emil drukker it is
impossible that this duality of murders
could be brought about by mere coinci-
dence for the similarity of detail was car-
w x-

ried too far this fact alone presupposes
the statement that there was a horrible
and unnatural bondage between emil
drukker and jason carse-the bondage
of the diary

  one night of eadi week for six weeks
jason carse was compelled by some un-
known power to dream about a murder
confessed and described in drukkers di-
ary on each of these nights while carse
watched it in a dream an identical mur-
der was committed somewhere in the city
and the man whom he recognized as the
murderer was emil drukker it was as if
carses dreams projected into reality by
the sheer vividness of the diary had res-
urrected emil drukker from his grave
and set him free to re-enact his former
crimes

  i am mad you will say but i speak of
demonism and not law how else can
you explain the duality of these murders
how else can you explain carses igno-
rance of the crimes how else can you
explain those brutal dreams the fruit of
whose reality carse found each morning
on the floor beside his bed nor is it
enough to stop alone with this question
how many men besides jason carse have
spent sleepless nights over the diary of
emil drukker

  the newspapers will answer that ques-
tion each time they are opened in paris
the police discover a headless body ly-
ing along the wharves and the murderer
is still unknown in berlin a college pro-
fessor kills himself upon the discovery of
a human head lying near his bed with
his own hunting-knife stuck to the hilt
into its brain in stockholm the police
discover the bodies of two women lying
in an empty house-their heads have not
yet been found and in cleveland one of
our greatest cities is reported the discov-
ery of the tenth headless corpse in a se-
ries of murders that has gripped the city


weird tales

in terror what kind of person com-
mits such crimes and why do the miss-
ing heads turn up years later in the base-
ment of a house owned by a mild-appear-
ing and docile old man

  jason carse was not the first man to
pay with his life for crimes such as these
nor is he the last it is well to beware
of sickish-smelling trunks that are left in

deserted houses and i caution the reader
against stepping on misshapen bundles
of clothing which he may find half hid-
den in a clump of bushes

  for the diary of emil drukker is miss-
ing from the drawer where i left it and
i have been told that a strange german-
ic-looking man was seen prowling about
the house just before its disappearance

ong arm

by franz habl

creeping writhing insidiously crawling and groping the long arm
reached out in its ghastly errand of death

i had been out of germany for
thirty-five years drawn hither and
thither by various glittering of will-
of-the-wisps when i returned to my na-
tive country i was as poor in pocket as
when i left and much poorer in illusions

  the berlin insurance company which
i had represented with such mediocre suc-
cess in switzerland austria and belgium
agreed to let me sell for them at home
and by a curious coincidence there was an
opening in the quaint old bavarian city in
which i had been born and bred

  i will pass over the strangely mingled
feelings with which i rode in a twentieth
century railroad train past the thousand-
year-old walls of one of the most curious
ancient cities in europe a town more-
over whose every winding narrow street
and sharp-gabled building had been the
companion of my infancy and childhood
no one seemed to know me and i recog-

  adapted by roy temple house from the german

nized no one for several days i made no
attempt to sell life insurance but wan-
dered in a dream the bewildered ghost
of my former self about die spots which
i had known in happier days

  one dull rainy afternoon i took refuge
from the weather in a dingy little coffee-
house in which at the age of fourteen or
fifteen i along with certain boon com-
panions had learned the gentle art of bil-
liards it seemed as if every article of
furniture was just as i had walked away
from diem well toward half a century
before it was raining outside and i sat
alone in the gloomy smoky old place
pondering the sweet and bitter mysteries
of life

  while i sat thus staring out with un-
seeing eyes at the rain which was by this
time beating down smartly on the pave-
ment i became conscious that someone
in the room was staring at me i had not
noticed that there was anyone else in the
the long arm



dark low-ceilinged place except the ob-
sequious proprietor who had served me
my cigar and coffee now i realized that
a man who sat in the corner diagonally
across from me was studying me curiously
from over his newspaper his face was
one that i had seen before suddenly
across all the years i remembered him
and in that same moment he rose and
came toward me with his hand held out

  we had been in school together in the

gymnasium he had been a strange fel-
low with few friends but had enjoyed
the reputation of being the best student in
his class but in his last year in the gym-
nasium he had for what reason i never
knew excited the animosity of a cantank-
erous old professor who had publicly de-
clared that gustav was not the kind of
boy who should have a gymnasium di-
ploma and that he the professor was de-
termined never to give him a passing

and she went too like the other


weird tales

grade my father had admired the boy
very much and at one juncture when my
marks looked perilously low he had
employed gustav to tutor me gustav
had been so successful that father was
delighted and made him a present of a
silver cigarette case with gustavs initials
and mine engraved on it i remembered
all this very distinctly as we shook hands
but i was doing fast thinking because
for the life of me i couldnt remember
his strange last name i had a feeling
that it was a very foreign name polish
or croatian or something of the sort as
he mentioned this and that i fear i
answered him a little absently and inco-
herently the name was almost there
the syllables flitted tantalizingly just out
of my reach but i was sure the name
began with a b wasnt it a bam- or a
ban-something ah i had it banaoto-
vich

  from that moment the conversation
went more easily i was surprized and
pleased when banaotovich drew his silver
cigarette-case out of his pocket to prove
to me how highly he thought of my
poor deceased father we were soon
launched on a cordial exchange of child-
hood memories banaotovich seemed a
good-hearted fellow after all and i
wondered why in my childhood i had
never been quite comfortable in his com-
pany i remembered that other boys of
the group had admitted to me confiden-
tially that they were more than a little
afraid of him

the longer we talked the more inti-
mate the more in the nature of a
mutual confession our conversation be-
came i admitted to banaotovich that the
hifalutin fashion in which i had left the
town to win fame and fortune years be-
fore had been asinine in the extreme
and that it served me just right to have
to sneak back unknown and penniless

banaotovich rejoined that for all his
pride in his school marks he had re-
mained a person of no importance and
that the pot had not die slightest inten-
tion of making itself ridiculous by calling
die kettle black he seemed almost pain-
fully inclined to run himself down i
could feel in his manner a sort of pathetic
reaching out for sympathy and consider-
ation and it began to seem as if he
were about to tell me something or ask
me for something but whatever he had
to tell seemed hard to say and it was
slow in coming over his lips

  banaotovich ordered two bottles of the
heavy native wine i drank sparingly of it
because it goes to my head but banaoto-
vich swallowed two or three glassfuls
in hasty succession and his cheeks grew
flushed there was a pause suddenly
he leaned across the table toward me and
spoke in a hoarse excited whisper

  modersohn he said anxiously i
want to make a confession to you-a
terrible confession it may turn you
against me completely maybe you dont
want to hear it if you dont say so and
ill go home but it seems as if ive got
to tell somebody about it it seems as if
ive got to find somebody who under-
stands me and can excuse me or it will
kill me shall i tell you shall i

  i was startled i was reasonably sure
that banaotovich was no criminal since
he had lived half a century in his native
city undisturbed and from all he had
told me solvent and respected i had al-
ways known that he was a queer fish a
brooding solitary sort of person and i
settled myself to listen to some harmless
bit of psychopathy which meant nothing
except to the unfortunate subject

  my dear fellow i said no doubt a
little patronizingly i am sure you
havent anything to confess that will
make you out an outrageous rascal but if
the long arm



it will do you any good to tell me your
troubles i am ready to listen to them
thank you said banaotovich in a
trembling voice ive done nothing that
they can put me behind the bars for

but i-i-

  he stared at me sternly

  but ive done worse things he said
solemnly than some poor fellows that
have been strung up by the neck and
choked to death

  i laughed a little nervously tell me
your story if you like i said and let
me decide just how black you are but i
havent a great deal of apprehension
were all of us poor miserable sinners as
far as thats concerned i could tell you

things about myself-

  banaotovich was not listening to me
at all he had fallen suddenly into a
fit of black brooding after a minute or
two he looked up and asked sharply
do you remember wolansky
wolansky was the greek professor
who had threatened to vote against bana-
otovich when he was finishing his course
at the gymnasium

  of course said i and i remember
well how he abused you that last year
if there ever was a cantankerous old
scoundrel wolansky was just that identi-
cal individual

  maybe he said absently then after
another pause

  do you remember that wolansky
died suddenly just a litle while before
the end of the school year

  i nodded i imagine that was a great
piece of good luck for you i said

  yes said banaotovich if he had
lived i should never have had my di-
ploma as it was i finished with honors
if wolansky hadnt died when he did
id have been ruined dont forget that
-ruined

  i was puzzled at his insistence yes
you would have been seriously handi-

capped i agreed ruined is the word
perhaps

  banaotovichs face was purple with
wine and some strange kind of suffering
do you remember another thing he
said thickly do you remember an old
hindoo who had a dark little hole away
back of the shops and the beer depot
and the livery stables between the old
market and the river

  the old fellow that had love charms
and told fortunes and helped people to
health and wealth and happiness i
said in a tone of slightly forced cheer-
fulness it was hard to be cheerful with
those somber eyes boring into you yes
i remember him all right i wanted to
go and see him once when i was about
fifteen or sixteen but father told me
that meddling with the black -art had sent
more people to hell than it had helped
and father was so terribly earnest about
it that he frightened me i never went
as a matter of fact it was only a passing
fancy and i soon forgot all about him

  that hindoo said my old school-
fellow thoughtfully knew things about
the secret forces in the universe that made
him almost a god and he taught me
things that the wisest philosopher in the
world doesnt suspect still your father
may have beeen right i think it very
likely that what he taught me may send
me to hell

  i shivered i looked up nervously to
make sure that the way was clear to the
door i began to suspect that my friend
banaotovich though he was certainly
not a criminal might be a dangerous
lunatic

  my vis-a-vis rubbed absently at a pro-
tuberance on his left side i had noticed
it when he first came across the room to
speak to me a deformity-i was sure
it had not been there when he was a
boy-or perhaps a tumor or some such
thing as that


weird tales

  i kept very quiet about what the
hindoo taught me because i knew most
people felt about sudi tilings mudi as
you say your father did and i wanted
to get on in the world but i had an
idea the hindoo could help me get on
perhaps he has-

  and he stared gloomily at space

  perhaps he has and perhaps he
hasnt

  he brooded then he took up the
thread of his story

  wolansky nearly drove me to sui-
cide i read and studied and crammed
day and night i tried everything i could
think of to overcome the mans antag-
onism i crawled in the dust before him
like a whipped cur nothing did any
good and when i saw he hated me and
was determined to smash me i began to
hate him too i came to hate him worse
than i hated the devils in hell there
was a time when i had to hold myself
back with all my strength to keep from
sticking a knife into him or braining
him with a chair but the hindoo and
i made some experiments with telepathy
and i discovered that there are other
ways of killing a man besides stabbing
him or giving him poison

  i learned how to make a man in front
of me on the street turn around and look
at me i learned how to make you dream
about me and come and tell me the
dream the next morning when he said
that i jumped for i remembered having
done exactly diat thing i learned how
to bring out a bruise on wolanskys face
although he lived on the other side of
town so that he went around asking
people how he could have bumped his
forehead without knowing it and at last
i went to bed one night set my mind
on wolansky and said over and over to
myself a thousand times die you dog
youve got to die i order you to die

   i said it over till i fell into a sort of

trance it wasnt sleep i tell you you
cant sleep when you are in a state like
that and in my trance i could feel an-
other arm grow out of my side here and
grow longer and longer and grow out
through the window although the win-
dow was closed and grow out across die
street and down the street and right
through the walls and across the river

  i had never known where wolansky
lived but that night i knew i had
never known the street or the house num-
ber i had never been there in my life
but i can tell you just exactly how his
bedroom looked the wash-stand be-
tween the two windows the work-table
against the west wall the wardrobe the
old divan against the north wall in a
corner the blue-gray tiled stove with
some of die tile chipped off and against
the south wall-the bed he lay in i
can tell you the color of the blanket he
pulled up over his face it was a dirty
brownish red

  but my hand seemed to go through
the blanket and grip wolansky by the
throat first he sighed and turned his
head to one side and tried to wriggle
free then he raised his arms and tried
to get hold of something that wasnt
there his sighs turned into groans and
die groans changed to a death rattle he
threw his arms and legs wildly around
in the air his body bent up like a bow
but my hand held his head down against
the pillow at last he quit struggling
and dropped down limp on the bed
then the arm came crawling back in to
my body and i came out of the trance-
and went to sleep-or perhaps i fainted

  the next morning the director came
into our classroom and told us wolansky
had died in die night of some sort of
attack you remember that i am
sure-

  when banaotovich began to tell me
this story he had looked away from me
the long arm



and his eyes never met mine during the
telling he had begun with a painful
effort but as he went on he grew more
and more excited and more and more
inflamed with hatred of the malicious
old greek teacher till it almost seemed
as if he had forgotten me and was living
the astounding experience through for
himself alone when he was through his
ecstasy of indignation left him and he sat
dejected and apprehensive studying me
pitifully out of the corners of his deep
gray eyes

when he stopped speaking there
was a moment of silence then i
said something i think what i said was
very extraordinary

   he smiled a strained sarcastic smile
extraordinary he repeated with an
interrogation point in his voice

  your nerves were strained to the
breaking-point i said your trouble
with the old rascal had driven you half
distracted then there was all that oc-
cultistic hodgepodge with the old hin-
doo and you were overworked and run
down anyway no wonder you dreamed
dreams and saw visions and it may have
been that there was some telepathic con-
tact between you and wolansky and

when he had his apoplectic attack-

  the sarcastic smile deepened on bana-
otovichs face so you have it all ex-
plained and im acquitted he inquired

  acquitted i cried you were
never even accused if the state were to
bring action against every man who had
a feeling that he would be happier if
someone else were out of die way the
state would have a big job on its hands
very true banaotovich assented
icily i see i havent got very far with
you yet you are forcing me to continue
my not very edifying autobiography-
did you know my father

  i remembered his father and i remem-

bered that he had not enjoyed the best
possible reputation

  i think i knew him i said hesi-
tantly he was a-a rrioney-lender
wasnt he

  dont spare my feelings said ban-
aotovich bitterly he was a usurer and
a cruel one i had a feeling for years
that his business was a disgrace to the
family and i made no bones about tell-
ing him so there were ugly scenes i
thought several times of leaving home
finally father told me one day that
since i didnt approve of the way he got
his money he was doing me the favor of
disinheriting me i told him that was all
right with me that id rather starve than
live on money that was stained with the
blood of poor debtors

   i thought at the time that i meant it
but about that time i had become inter-
ested in a young woman i had never
had much to do with the girls and very
few of them seemed at all interested in
me but this one appeared to like me
and when i made advances to her she
didnt repel me i am no connoisseur of
female beauty but i think she was un-
usually attractive and at that time i was
half mad about her still waters run deep
you know

  well she had me under her spell so
completely that i changed my mind about
fathers money i began to truckle to
him much as i had truckled to wolansky
i began to feel him out to find whether
he had made a will he was very cold
and non-committal finally i asked him
outright if he would reconsider his de-
cision to leave me penniless he told me
it was i that had made the decision not
he and that he had no use for wishy-
washy people that changed their minds
like weather-cocks he was very sarcastic

i lost my temper and answered him back
we had a terrible quarrel and finally he
-he struck me i was twenty years old


weird tales

and a bigger man than he and i think
no man ever had more stubborn pride
at bottom than i have

  it was the wolansky thing all over
again the humiliation the effort at in-
gratiation the failure the long eating
gnawing growing hatred and it-it
ended the same way the night of
brooding that hardened into a devilish
decision the vision of the long arm
growing stretching crawling-but not
so far this time only through two walls
and across our own house you remem-
ber that father died of an apoplectic
stroke just as wolansky had done a year
or two before

  yes i think i remember i said in
considerable embarrassment the thing
did begin to look uncanny i was
thoroughly sorry for the poor cracked
fellow but i would just as soon not have
been alone with him in that solitary
drinking-place in the twilight

  well he said almost sharply
well banaotovich i answered with
a show of confidence you have had a
great deal of unhappiness and you have
my sympathy this strange faculty you
have of anticipating deaths like the
night-owls and the death-watch that ticks
in the walls has made these bereavements
an occasion of self-torment for you i
think you should see a psychiatrist
anticipating - anticipating bana-
otovich had gone back and was repeat-
ing a word i had used and as he repeated
it he drummed madly on the table with
his fingers its a curious coincidence
that anticipating is just the word my
wife used when i told her about it
you-told-your wife-what you
have just told me i stammered do
you think that was wise

  i couldnt help it he said with a
catch in his throat i thought i loved
her and i had to talk to somebody i
was miserable and i had a feeling that

she might understand and be brought
closer to me by sympathy now that i
think of it i can see that i was an egre-
gious idiot but i discovered long ago that
we arent rational beings after all we
are driven or drawn by mysterious forces
and we go to our destination because
we cant help it

  my wife had always seemed a little
timid with me i never seemed to have
the gift of attracting people and i dont
know whether she would ever have been
interested in me at all if i hadnt used a
little-a little charm the hindoo taught
me perhaps that didnt have much to do
with it-but i had never been happy with
her however that may be one evening
when she seemed unusually approachable
i had just the same impulse that i had
when i met you here tonight and i told
her about wolansky and father she
pooh-poohed it all just as you did but
she was afraid i could see that she was
more and more afraid of me as the days
went by for a long time she tried to be
cordial and natural in my presence but
it was a sham and the poor thing couldnt
keep it up each of us knew as well what
was in the mind of the other as if we
had talked the situation over frankly for
hours we reached the point where we
couldnt look each other in the face no
solitude could have been as ghastly as
that solitude of two people who shared a
revolting secret for i had convinced her
that i was guilty i had succeeded in
doing what i had set out to do and i had
ruined two lives in doing it i have the
faculty it seems of poisoning whatever
i touch only today my wife said to
me-

  i started to my feet with a great rush
of relief and thankfulness ah your
wife is alive then i cried

  my wife is alive that is-my second
wife is alive he said with a horrible
forced smile
the long arm



  i sank back gasping what did you
do with your first wife you dirty hound
i moaned in helpless indignation

he closed his eyes and a wave of
bitter triumph played about the
muscles of his mouth have i convinced
you too at last he said

  then i realized that i had been an
insulting idiot at worst the man before
me was a pathological case and he cer-
tainly belonged in an asylum rather than
in a prison

   forgive me banaotovich i panted

i dont know what made me-

  he looked at me sadly almost com-
passionately there is nothing to for-
give he said very quietly i am all
you called me and a thousand times
worse now let me finish my story
you dont need to i said hastily
i know all the rest of it

  all interest i am afraid nearly all
sympathy had gone out of me what i
wanted most of all was to get away from
this melancholy citizen with power and
madness in his gray eyes

  no you dont know quite all of it
yet he insisted perhaps if i tell you
the whole story even if you cant excuse
me-and i dont deserve your excusing
i dont want your excusing-you can
understand me a little better and think of
me a little more kindly

  there was another woman i couldnt
help it any more than any of us can help
anything a fine sympathetic young
woman who loved me because she knew
i was unhappy i had been married to
the other woman for four years we were
completely estranged we could scarcely
bear to speak to each other i couldnt
be easy one moment in the same house
with her i had a cot in my office out in
town because i couldnt even sleep sound-
ly at home it was hell the terror in
her eyes made me physically sick my

wife learned about the other woman my
wife was a devout catholic and there
was no possibility of a divorce i could
read in my wifes face just what went
on in her mind she knew the other
woman had become my only reason for
living and one day i read in her eyes
along with the terror a glint of desperate
determination she knew she was in
danger she knew i had a power that i
could exercise when i chose in spite of
all the courts and police and jails in the
country she knew her life was in
danger and her eyes told me that mine
was in danger for that very reason i
didnt blame her half my grief through
all the years had been grief for her
but the instinct of self-defense in
me was strong-and-she went-too-
like-

  he never finished his sentence he
dropped his head on the table and began
to sob hysterically i laid a gingerly
hand on his shoulder

  banaotovich i said unsteadily
im sorryor you-

  he sat up and supported his chin in
both hands i havent been as-as bad
as all this sounds like he said after a
while before i was married a second
time i went to the chief of police and
gave myself up the chief listened to my
story-i didnt try to explain it all as
ive done with you but just blurted out
the main facts but the longer he listened
the uneasier he became and when i got
through he asked me nervously if i didnt
think i ought to go into a sanitarium
for a while then he bowed me out in a
big hurry perhaps if i had told him all
the ins and outs of it it might have been
different-

   but dont you think hes right about
the sanitarium

  right im as sane as you are ive
killed three people a crazy scoundrel a


weird tales

hard man and a pure innocent woman
but i did it all because i had to a sani-
tarium wouldnt do me or anyone else
any good and it would be a heavy
expense i have taken the responsibility
for another pure innocent woman and i
must support her the war and the de-
pression swept away my fathers fortune
and my present business has dwindled
away till i am making only the barest
living i have applied for the agency
for a big berlin insurance company and
if i can get it along with my other busi-
ness i shall be fairly comfortable but i
understand there is some talk of their
sending in a representative from outside
if they do that if they take the bread out
of my mouth like that it wont be good
for the outsider

  he was drunk and his drunkenness
was working him into an ugly mood he
was dangerous and physical courage was
never my strong point

  what is the name of the berlin com-
pany i asked timidly

  he named the firm i myself worked
for then he fumbled for his bottle
and with stern and painful attention set

about the difficult and delicate task of
filling his glass again i muttered some-
thing about being back in a moment
and made for the door he was too busy
to pay any attention to me

  when i had the door safely shut be-
hind me i sprinted through the rain to
my hotel as if the devil himself were
after me   

it was a long time before i got over
waking up in the middle of the night
with the feeling that an icy iron-
muscled hand was clutching at my throat
i dont have the experience often any
more but i have never seen the city of
my birth since that awful night i got
out on the midnight train and my com-
pany obligingly gave me territory on the
other side of germany

  some time ago i happened to see a
notice in the paper to the effect that a
certain patient named g banaotovich
had died suddenly in the staatliche
nervenheilanstalt in nuremberg but i
have met the name rather frequently of
late and i think it is a fairly common
one i didnt investigate

-yake of life

by edmond hamilton

 a weird-scientific t brill-tale of adventure mystery and romance-of tbe waters
 of immortality tbe strange red and black cities and the dread guardians
 that watched eternally over that terribly glowing lake

the story thus far

eep in the unexplored jungles
of equatorial africa lies the
lake of life it is a lake of
shining waters that contain the pure es-
sence of life the origin of life on earth

d

and it is guarded by unhuman terrible
beings the guardians and anyone who
drinks of those shining waters becomes
immortal

  that is the legend of many african
tribes asa brand senile american mil-
lionaire morbidly afraid of death believes

this story began in weird tales for september




weird tales

that legend and thinks if he drinks of
those waters his life will be vastly ex-
tended so he has offered clark stan-
nard young adventurer a half-million
dollars if he procures for him a flask of
waters from the lake of life

  clark stannard does not himself be-
lieve the shining waters will confer im-
mortality but has undertaken the quest
his five hard-bitten followers are blacky
cain gangster mike shinn former
heavyweight prizefighter lieutenant john
morrow disgraced army officer link
wilson a texan cowboy and ephraim
quell former yankee sea captain

  the quest has brought the six into a
hidden land surrounded by the moun-
tains of death mountains which it is
death to tread upon they have gained
entrance to the prisoned land by floating
down a wild river that flows in through
a chasm in the mountains

  in this hidden land they find two cities
of white people at war with each other
they are klamm city of the reds and
dordona city of the blacks clark and
his five men repel a band of black war-
riors who attack them and capture their
leader the leader is lurain wildcat
daughter of the ruler of dordona

  then they are surrounded by a large
force of red warriors from the near-by
city klamm clark learns that the lake
of life exists somewhere near the city
dordona the dordonans hold it is sac-
rilege for anyone to try to drink of the
lake of life but the people of klamm
thirst to drink of it and become immortal
so that there is war between the two
peoples

  clark stannard believes that his only
chance of reaching the lake is to join
thargo king of klamm as an ally
he agrees to go to the red city but stipu-
lates that the girl lurain is his prisoner
not anyone elses the six american ad-

venturers and their prisoner and escort of
red warriors are now riding into the city
klamm

  the story continues

	the king of klamm

the city klamm was circular in
outline and more than two miles in
diameter surrounded by a forty-foot wall
the wall and buildings and cobbled
streets were all of quarried stone stained
bright red by some secret of pigmenta-
tion the buildings were mostly flat-
roofed one-story ones shops and stalls
and dwellings the inhabitants were
swarming excitedly out of them as the
cavalcade rode down the street

  clark saw that at least half the men
wore the crimson armor and the long
swords-it was a strongly military popu-
lation the helmeted warriors the sim-
ple architecture and weapons all looked
medieval to clark as though the civili-
zation of this isolated prisoned people
had not progressed further than the mid-
dle ages of the outside world there
were many women wearing extremely
scanty white tunics that came only to their
knees and left half their white breasts
bare

  say theres some good-lookin dames
in this burg said mike shinn the prize-
fighters eyes sweeping the crowd

  and there are a lot of hard-looking
warriors here too clark reminded him
grimly hands off mike

  what the devil we could put the
blast on this mob easy sneered blacky
cain there isnt a gat in the whole
crowd

 the men and women of klamm
seemed inspired with savage fury as they
saw the girl prisoner in black armor in
front of clark

  death to lurain of dordona they
the lake of life



yelled shaking swords and fists in impre-
cation death and torture for the dor-
donan wench

  lurain looked neither to right nor left
again that strong unwilling respect for
the girl stirred in clark stannard

  you are still our prisoner he leaned
forward to tell her they shall not take
you from us

  i do not fear them-nor you snarled
lurain without turning the day comes
when this red spawn go to their doom
at the end of the broad avenue down
which they rode loomed the largest build-
ing in the city it was an hexagonal scar-
let tower blunt and truncated a hundred
feet high a squat ugly structure they
dismounted in front of it and the red
captain dral strode to them

  the king thargo has been already in-
formed of your coming and anxiously
awaits you he informed clark smoothly

  lead the way clark said curtly
our prisoner goes with us and as
they started forward he muttered to his
men keep close together and dont
make a move unless were attacked
they followed dral into the building
past red-armored guards and down corri-
dors dral clanked in the lead clark fol-
lowing with the girl her dark head high
his five men rolling belligerently along
and staring about with frank curiosity

  they emerged into a large round ban-
queting-hall with red stone walls lit by
shafts of sunset from slit-like windows
all around it were tables empty now ex-
cept for one raised on a dais there alone
sat a man in the red helmet and armor a
great jewel blazing on his breast behind
him hovered a wrinkled-faced withered
old man with sly eyes

  the strangers and the captive great
king announced dral as he paused and
bowed to the sitting man the man
stood up

  you are welcome strangers thargo

told clark yes more than welcome
when you bring as captive lurain of
dordona

  thargo king of klamm was a big
man well over six feet he towered and
his shoulders were as broad as mike
shinns his shining red armor well set
off that towering great-thewed figure

  there was power in his face not only
the arrogant consciousness of utter
authority but hard power innate in the
man himself it was in the square merci-
less mouth in the flaring nostrils strong-
est of all in the black penetrating eyes
behind which little devil-lights of mock-
ery and amused contempt seemed to
dance

  be ready for trouble clark muttered
to his men it may pop right this
minute

  for dral the red captain was now
making a respectful report to his lord
and thargo stiffened as he heard

  so you claim the black girl as your
prisoner he said to clark his eyes nar-
rowing

  clark nodded curtly we do we
took her and she is ours

  now why strangers from outside
did you penetrate this land thargo
asked thoughtfully no others from
outside have ever crossed the death
mountains and entered what object
brought you here

  in the great world outside clark
told him there are legends of a strange
shining lake in this land we came in
search of that lake and once we find it
will return with some of its waters to our
own land

  the legends you heard were true
strangers said thargo with changed
expression that shining lake of life
does exist in this land but not here not
at klamm for many generations we
of klamm have been striving also to
win to that lake it may be he added


weird tales

craftily that you and i should become
allies dral tells me your weapons are
strange and powerful together we
would have no trouble in winning to the
lake of life

  never will you win to the lake red
dog lashed lurains silver voice sud-
denly even if you conquered us of
dordona there are still-the guardians
the guardians echoed thargo
then uttered a deep laugh why the
guardians are but a myth a legend for
ages that myth has kept you of dordona
from the lake but it shall not keep us
no

  his nostrils were flaring with abrupt
passion his black eyes suddenly all devil
clark seemed to glimpse in the mans
wolfish face a long-repressed eating am-
bition a desire of superhuman intensity
baffled and raging then thargo smiled
smoothly at him

  we shall talk of these things later
strangers meanwhile you are welcome
in klamm tonight we banquet here in
your honor and until then the finest
rooms in this palace are yours

  our prisoner goes with us clark
said coolly

  your prisoner goes with you of
course thargo agreed smoothly but
guard the little wildcat well i warn you
i do not think she could escape from
this palace-a gleam of mirth crossed
his eyes-no  do not think that but
she might do harm if not guarded

  dral will conduct you to your
rooms he finished courteously until
tonight strangers

  clark bowed curtly then taking
lurains tensed arm he followed the
suave captain out of the great banquet
hall his five men strode after him and
dral led the way up a broad stone stair
to an upper floor of stone-walled corri-
dors and rooms he conducted them into
a suite of four large rooms

tapestries depicting combats of red
and black armored soldiers hung on
the walls and lay on the floor there
wrere chairs and couches and a series of
great windows whose unshuttered open-
ings looked out on the flat red roofs of
klamm gleaming in the sunset dral
bowed and left them closing the door
the girl lurain went over to the window
and stood a slim figure looking silently
out over klamm

  say what was all the powwow
about blacky cain asked clark this
moll seemed to get the big shots goat
clark told them briefly what had
passed between him and thargo

  as far as i can see clark finished
our best course is to play along with
thargo until we find out where we
stand he wants to get to the lake thats
evident-he believes that stuff about its
waters conferring immortality its also
evident that lurains people the dor-
donans prevent him from reaching the
lake and would prevent us also our best
chance to reach this lake of life may be
to throw in with thargo

  why didnt you give up this girl to
the red king then asked lieutenant
morrow it would put us in solid with
him

  but thargo would likely have had
her killed or tortured clark objected
its plain hed like nothing better
well what if he did shrugged the
young ex-army officer indifferently and
morrows face was bitter with memory
as he added keeping her our own pris-
oner may wreck everything-it wont be
the first time a womans done it

  why ye heartless scut said mike
shinn wrath fully would ye give up a
spunky girl like that to be killed
were not giving her up clark said
decisively i want to question her about
the lake of life

  he advanced toward lurain and the
the lake of life

 

dordonan girl turned and met his gaze
defiantly with hot stormy blue eyes

  lurain just where is the lake of
life clark asked if you told us that
it may be wed let you escape from here
would you asked lurain doubt-
fully coming closer to him clark nod-
ded quickly in affirmation

  yes we would can you tell us how
to reach the lake

  lurain came so close that the haunting
perfume of her blue-black hair was in his
nostrils her troubled eyes raised

  i cannot tell the secrets of the sacred
lake she said slowly worriedly but
i can tell you-this

  and her hand suddenly jerked out the
sheath-knife at clarks belt and stabbed
it with lightning speed at his heart

	thar gos treachery

instinct can save itself where the
momentary delay of reason would be
fatal it was not the first time in his life
that clark stannard had seen the swift
deadly flicker of steel licking toward his
heart the sight exploded his brain and
body into instant action

  he threw himself staggeringly back-
ward and the bleak steel whizzed down
through the front of his shirt scoring his
breast like a white-hot wire before
lurain could turn the blade and strike
upward clarks brown hand grabbed her
wrist he twisted it and was not gentle
there was a cold savage anger in his
brain the knife clattered to the floor
from the twisted hand lurains blue
eyes blazed out of a paper-white face but
she uttered no cry of pain or fear hate
throbbing from her

so youd trick me would you spat
clark harshly youd kill me to keep
me from reaching your sacred lake eh
yes i would lurains voice cracked
like a silver whip you who would be-

come thargos ally who would help him
and the other blasphemers of klamm
who lust for the lake-you deserve
death

  i warned you lieutenant morrow
told clark bitterly all women are alike
-just playing you for a sucker

  say the dames got nerve said
blacky cain respect and admiration in
the gangsters pale eyes

  she sure has grinned link wilson
reminds me of a litle mex down in
agua prieta who tried to knife me one

night when-

  hell we can do without auto-
biography rasped clark bring cords
and well tie her hands-shes not safe
unbound

  when they had finished securing the
bonds around lurains wrists the dor-
donan girl sat and glared at them fiercely

  someone has to stay here and watch
her while were down at this banquet
clark declared not only because she
might escape but because i dont trust
thargo too far quell will you stay
ill watch her ephraim quell
nodded dourly dont figger id care
much for the goings-on down there any-
way

  night fell quickly from the window
klamm stretched a mass of dark flat
roofs in the starlight with windows and
doors spilling red torchlight somber
against the climbing stars bulked the
looming mighty barrier of the moun-
tains of death

  clark and his men shaved brushed
their clothes and made what improve-
ments they could in their appearance by
the light of the flickering torches servants
had brought then dral appeared his
long sword clanking on the stone floor
as he entered

  the lord thargo awaits you at the
banquet strangers he said his eyes
flickering toward the bound girl


weird tales

the great round banquet hall flared
brightly with ruddy torchlight when
clark stannard and his four companions
entered it after dral now the tables that
ran around the room were laden heavily
with cooked meats and fruits and big
glass flagons of black and yellow wines
at them sat more than a hundred men
and women the nobles and artistocrats of
feudal medieval klamm

  the men wore the red metal-mesh
tunics and their swords even at table
the women wore chitons of red stuffs
much like the garments of the women
they had seen in the city but richer em-
broidered with gold and jewels their
upper breasts and arms were bare as in
the old cretan costume they drank and
laughed with the male feasters but they
and all in the hall fell silent staring in
eager curiosity at these five swaggering
strangers who first in all the history of
this land had entered from outside the
deadly mountains

  welcome to our feast strangers
thargo greeted in his powerful voice
here are seats for you and here are
wine and meats and women for we count
you as ourselves who are we hope to be
our allies in the great quest we soon shall
make

  the red kings face was frank and
open the sincerity of his greeting warm-
ing but clark wondered was there not
a suppressed gleam in his black eyes a
quirk of secret amusement

  clark took the backless metal chair
held out for him beside thargo himself
his four followers were distributed
further along the table on the other side
of clark sat a languorous beaut intro-
duced to him as yala the sister of
thargo despite his inward alertness
clark could not but be moved to ad-
miration by the coal-black hair smooth
ivory skin and audaciously revealed
rounded figure of this princess of

klamm her velvety black eyes met his
curiously

  but he turned toward thargo he felt
that the time had come to learn what he
could of the mysteries surrounding him

  you still wish us then to become
your allies in an attempt to reach the
lake of life he askc-d bluntly

  very much i wish it thargo
avowed frankly you carry weapons of
a power unknown here and they will
make certain our victory though i am
sure that even without them we still
could crush dordona

  where is the lake clark demanded
directly

  it lies beneath us thargo answered

  beneath us

  aye the red king nodded deep
beneath this prisoned land under leagues
of solid rock exists a great cavern and
in that cavern lies the shining lake of
life

  then how in the world can you hope
to reach it exploded clark stiffening

  there is only one way down to that
cavern of the lake thargo told him
it is a pit or shaft whose mouth is in
the city of our enemies dordona near
the eastern edge of this land the river
that flows through the mountains runs
across this whole land and drops into
that pit

  long ago thargo continued our
ancestors came into this land from the
outside world they climbed over the
mountains for at that time so legend
says it was not death to tread the moun-
tains as it is now they explored the
land and found the pit into which the
river falls and went down that pit into
the cavern where lies the lake of life
and they learned that if they drank
those waters they would become im-
mortal but they were forbidden to drink
of them

  they were forbidden they said by

                        w t-
the lake of life



strange unhuman beings who dwelled
down in the cavern of the lake and
guarded its waters of immortality these
beings the guardians bade those explor-
ing humans to return to the surface and
never again come down to drink of the
waters since that was an unholy thing
so the men returned in fear to the sur-
face obeying the command and legend
says that the guardians then cast a deadly
force on the mountains around this land
which still invests them so that no more
men might enter this land in future

  the people who were already within
this land founded a city around the
mouth of that shaft to the underworld
they called the city dordona and over
the mouth of the pit they built a temple
they considered it blasphemy for any to
think of descending the pit to the lake
of immortality and in their superstition
they slew any who dared to try it for
they were in great fear of the guardians
they believed dwelling below though
none but the first explorers had ever seen
those beings

  but as generations passed age after
age rebellion grew up in the city dor-
dona many of its people said why
should we die when beneath our feet lie
the waters of immortality who are the
guardians to forbid us the lake let us
not allow them to monopolize the waters
of immortality longer let us go down
and drink of them whether they permit
it or not so that we may become un-
dying 

  thargos fist clenched his eyes glit-
tered as he continued thus spake the
rebellious ones in dordona they sought
by force to enter the pit and descend to
the lake but most of the dordonans
were still swayed by superstitious fears
of the mysterious guardians they put
down the rebels by force prevented them
from entering the pit after that the
rebels deserted dordona and came here
w t-

to the western edge of this land and
founded a new city this city of klamm

  and ever since then we of klamm
have desired to go back and conquer the
dordonans and go down the pit to the
lake of life we had not the strength
at first but during past generations
more and more people have deserted
from dordona to our city coming to be-
lieve as we do that it is folly to grow old
and die when immortality is in our grasp
so that now stranger we of klamm
are powerful enough at last to attack
dordona crush the superstitious blacks
force our way down to the shining lake
and drink its waters and achieve immor-
tal it

  you actually believe then clark
stannard said incredulously that the
waters of the lake would confer im-
mortality

  i am sure of it thargo said his
eyes flashing if we drink of them we
shall never die for they contain the pure
essence of life itself that fact our ex-
ploring ancestors were sure about

  yet youre not afraid of meeting the
legended guardians if you penetrate to
the lake clark asked curiously

  thargo laughed contemptuously the
guardians do not frighten us for we do
not think they still watch down there by
the lake no man has seen them for
ages and even the few who saw them
ages ago were not slain by diem i
think that even if the guardians still exist
down there they will not be able to stop
us

  here wras a frank unfearing skeptic
clark thought it was odd that while
thargo was so skeptical of the dreaded
guardians he still believed in die impos-
sible virtues of the shining lake

  why clark asked bluntly do you
want our help if you have enough forces
to overwhelm dordona as you say
we want it thargo said frankly


weird tales

not because we need your help-easily
can we overcome dordona-but because
we do not want you against us strangers
with your strange powerful weapons
and for reward for joining us the red
king added you shall drink the w-aters
of the lake of life with us you will
become immortal strangers as we will

thargos black eyes hashed with
strange light his fist clenched tight
his voice pregnant with emotion

  to be immortal-think what that
will mean to stride the world undying
generation after generation feared and
worshipped by the races that continue to
die by the sun once i have drunk those
waters of undying life i will go forth
from this prisoned land will rule-

  he stopped abruptly glancing at clark
with narrowed eyes then he continued
in a smooth lower tone

  but what is your answer stranger
now that you know the situation do
you join forces with us to attack dor-
dona

  clark hesitated a strong instinct told
him not to commit himself

  i think we will join you he said
slowly but before i give my wrord on
it i must speak with my followers if we
do join you our reward is to be as much
of the shining waters as we wish to take

  has that dordonan wench lurain
tried to turn you against me thargo
asked suspiciously has she endeavored
to make you an ally of her doomed
people

  she tried to kill me but an hour
ago clark said tartly theres no
danger of my becoming her ally

  yet it seemed to him that smoldering
suspiciort persisted in thargos eyes
then the red king laughed and ex-
claimed

  but we will talk further of this in the
morning we neglect the feast

  he raised his big hand in a signal
from an alcove suddenly thrummed
music weird harmonies of plucked
strings it throbbed louder wilder and a
score of supple girls in shimmering veils
rushed lightly to the center of the torch-
lit hall

  they began to dance in the space be-
tween the tables swaying whirling and
undulating to the barbaric rush of the
music their white limbs gleaming
through the gossamer of the swirling
veils

  whoopee shouted mike shinn hap-
pily over the wild music from down the
table this is better than a night-club

  dont bother me mike drawled
link wilson his tanned reckless face
bending toward a laughing girl beside
him im doin right fine in sign-lan-
guage with this mnchacha

   ill say this beats that damned jungle
anyway clark heard blacky cain say-
ing with a rasping chuckle

  but lieutenant morrow sat drinking
and staring moodily with bitter eyes at
the whirling weaving girls

  you do not drink lord from out-
side a soft voice reproached clark it
was yala the sister of thargo bending
toward him her slender white fingers ex-
tending a goblet of the black thick wine
is our wine then so poor beside that of
the outside world

  clark took the goblet tasted the
liquor it was heady stuff potent
strangely scented yalas languorous eyes
approved as he drained the cup an alert
servant refilled it from a flagon

  aye drink all boomed thargos
powerful voice over the music drink
to the day that is almost here the day
when we of klamm win at last to the
shining waters that will make us all un-
dying

  to the day shouted the excited
half-intoxicated feasters draining the
the lake of life



goblets and setting them down with a
crash

  clark stannard felt sudden heady ex-
altation as he set down the goblet for
the second time the wine sang in his
veins and suddenly life seemed wild
sweet thrilling it was good to have
done with die old and outworn things of
the world he had known to sit here with
this company in feast

  they were a good crowd he thought
warmly as he drained the goblet again
they were making his men welcome for
now mike shinn was standing up and
bellowing an irish song and they were
laughing and applauding morrow was
drinking heavily silently and the lank
texan had his arm around the girl next
to him and only blacky cains dark
predatory face still remained watchful as
the gangster sat there what the deuce
was blacky so watchful about-every-
one here was their friend

  thargos powerful face had a smile of
complete friendliness on it damned
good scout thargo-by heaven he and
his men would help thargo conquer
those superstitious dordonans and the
girl yala swaying languorously closer to
him perfumed white shoulders and
breasts rising out of her red chiton like a
great lily brooding sweetness of her
black eyes making clarks swimming
senses reel

  are many men of the outer world as
hard and handsome of face as you lord
from outside she whispered

  that may be clark laughed but
ot this im sure-no women of that outer
world are as beautiful as you princess

  her eyes were melting as she swayed
closer and slender satin fingers touched
and twined about his in electrical con-
tact

  then as he bent unsteadily toward
yala clark just glimpsed an upward
meaning flash of her dark eyes directed

at thargo it chilled instantly through
the winy haze around clarks brain

  danger here shouted an alarmed voice
inside him he realized suddenly how
near he was to intoxication that wine-
hed already tossed off three or four gob-
lets of it and yala was proffering him
another beaker of the black stuff with a
soft smile

  wine brings gracious compliments
from you lord from outside i would
hear more-so drink

  clark took the goblet but now his
half-hazy brain raced yala was trying
to get him drunk that was certain and
from the glance he had intercepted he
knew it was at thargos orders

  nevertheless he took the goblet but
as he raised it clark feigned a far greater
dazedness than he felt letting his gaze
wander dully making his tongue thick
when he spoke

  shouldnt drink any more he mut-
tered thickly to the leaning princess
doesnt take much-to knock me out

  but you do not wish surely to de-
prive me of further compliments yalas
red ripe mouth pouted bewitchingly

  clark laughed unsteadily though in-
wardly he was cold and alert never-
never say no to a lady heres to your
eyes

  he drained the goblet the heady wine
made his half-numbed senses spin but he
resolutely kept his head yet he feigned
now a complete intoxication hurled the
glass away with a drunken laugh

  yala i could give you compliments
all night he said maudlinly youre
most - most beautiful woman - ever
lived

  as his eyelids pretended to droop
clark caught again that significant glance
from the girl to her brother then she
was leaning her warm breath whispering
in his ears

  would wou rather tell me those


weird tales

things where there are not so many to
listen lord from outside she mur-
mured

  sure thats what we need -- a little
more quiet clark said sleepily my
head too-feels funny-

  come with me she whispered
softly  will take you where it is quiet
-and where you can tell me all those
things

  her soft hand under his elbow im-
pelled him to his feet clark swayed un-
steadily blinking owlishly over the torch-
lit hall and the noisy riotous feasters
his dulled gaze was really keenly alert
he perceived that shinn and link wil-
son were at the height of merriment with
their red neighbors and that morrow
was still drinking heavily but blacky
cain was still alert could be depended
on to w-atch the others

none of the feasters in the din of
laughter clinking goblets and
shouting voices noticcd as clark stan-
nard stumbled out of the hall with yala
half supporting him yet clark glimpsed
thargo looking keenly after them

  he stumbled with the princess of
klamm down shadowy stone halls and
finally into a great chamber which
breathed of femininity silken hangings
of yellowf were on the walls in the soft
light of low-burning torches across the
room was a low soft silken couch and
above it a great window looked across the
starlit roofs of klamm

  yala spoke a few soft words and the
two submissivc-looking girls who had
hurried forward hastily withdrew the
red princess led clark to the coudi and
as he sat down unsteadily looking heav-
ily about she poured more of the black
wine from a flagon in the room

  she drank also her dark eyes look-
ing over the rim of the glass with an ex-
pression tliat despite himself stirred his

blood then she held the glass to his
lips her fingertips caressing his cheek

  drink with me to our-friendship
she murmured

  clark drank his brain seemed to float
inside his skull as the additional alcohol
leaped into his blood but every fiber in
him was taut and alert he blinked at
yala as though she was hard for him to
see she came temptingly closer to him

  does the wine make me look-more
beautiful she asked provocatively her
arms went softly around his neck

  dont need wine for that muttered
clark he set his lips against her half-
opened ones his hands tightening on her
bare perfumed shoulders

  he knew the kiss was as feigned on
her part as on his ow-n but for all that
it was none the less wildly thrilling
then as she drew back a little from his
embrace eyes seardiing his dazed-looking
face yala asked him seductively

  lord tell me-am i more beautiful
than the dordonan girl you took captive
-lurain

  much-much more beautiful stam-
mered clark his eyelids drooping shes
just-little wildcat

  has lurain asked you and your men
to help dordona in the coming war
yala asked him swiftly has she made
any offers to get you to ally yourselves
with dordona

  now clark knew suddenly he had
discovered the reason for this subtle
temptation by yala thargo was suspi-
cious suspicious that clark might have
agreed with the dordonan girl to aid her
people that he might be intending to be-
tray klamm thargo had had this girl
one capable of tempting an angel get
him intoxicated to question him

  lurain has not asked me to help dor-
dona clark said thickly his eyes clos-
ing his body swaying sleepily against
yala i-wouldnt listen to her if she
the lake of life



did the dordonans she led tried to
kill me and my men were-going to
help thargo conquer their city

  he heard the hiss of yalas indrawn
breath then she murmured softly you
are tired lord from outside you must
rest

   he let himself fall like a log onto the
soft couch as she lowered him then he
heard yala stand up quickly she bent
over him as he lay with eyes closed her
breath warm on his face he breathed in
long snores pretending heavy drunken
sleep

   satisfied yala went to the door of the
chamber and uttered a low call almost
at once clark heard the tramp of heavier
feet entering the chamber two pairs of
them the first voice that spoke was
thargos he guessed the red king had
been waiting outside

   you heard yala was saying swiftly
he is safely on our side-he will have
nothing to do with dordona

  yes i heard thargo said t was
suspicious because he would not give up
the dordonan princess to us but no
doubt he is keeping the girl for himself
simply because she is pretty

   that half-boy fighting cat said yala
scornfully what would any man want
with her

  the voice of thargos companion in-
terrupted it was an age-cracked ominous
voice clark guessed to be that of the
withered old counsellor he had seen with
thargo when he had first met the red
king

   better to slay all these strangers to-
night by surprize and make sure he
warned we of klamm have more
than enough force to conquer dordona
and win to the lake we do not need the
strangers help

  no we will not slay them shama-
not yet thargo said authoritatively
their weapons are powerful from what

dral says they might kill many of us
before we slew them all and that would
be bad for the minds of our people at
this time when we are on the-very verge
of our long-planned attack on dordona
besides why not make use of these
strangers to make our conquest even
easier

  this is what we shall do he con-
tinued in a hard rapid voice four days
from now as we have planned we ride
to attack dordona and the strangers go
with us in the attack on the black city
we will put them in the forefront as
soon as we have won dordona and our
way down to the lake of life lies clear
and open then we shall turn suddenly on
the strangers and kill them all

s the fight at the gate

it was all clark stannard could do to
keep his body from stiffening betray-
ingly as he lay in pretended drunken
sleep listening to those calmly treacher-
ous words blind fury burned in him as
he heard thargos callous plan to make
use of him then dispose of him yet he
managed to preserve his appearance of
intoxicated stupor his muscles tensed as
he heard thargos strong step come over
to the couch and he knew that the red
king was looking down at him

  this drunken fool said thargo
contemptuously if he is a sample of
the men of the outside world they will
not be hard for us to rule once we have
drunk of the lake and are immortal

  be not so sure warned the old coun-
sellor shama this man and his com-
rades have courage and cunning or they
could not have penetrated the death
mountains no men ever came through
before

  he was not cunning enough thargo
said scornfully to prevent a womans
eyes from making a sot of him you did


weird tales

well what i asked my sister in fact the
task did not seem distasteful to you
perhaps not yala said with a soft
laugh fool he may be but this man is
-different until he and his men ride
with your forces to dordona four days
hence i think to find him amusing
that is your affair thargo said in-
differently best get him back to his
chambers now before his men miss him
shama and i return to the feast

  clark heard the ruthless plotter and
the aged counsellor leave then yala
bent over him holding a pungent liquid
to his nose and shaking him softly

  wake lord from outside she said
tenderly you must not stay here longer
-my brother would be angry

  clark was careful to awake slowly
blinking and rubbing his eyes dazedly
more wine he muttered thickly got
to have more wine-so i can tell you-

how beautiful you are-

  you shall have opportunity for that
in the next few days yala promised
with a provocative smile you had best
return to your chambers now and sleep
nsy lord it seems that you are almost
overcome by my beauty-or the wine

  she went to the door and called as
clark stumbled to his feet a warrior in
the crimson armor answered quickly

  this soldier will conduct you to your
chambers yala told him until to-
morrow lord from outside

  her fingers clung warmly to his in
caressing promise clark nodded dazedly
and staggered out into the hall he
stumbled with his guide by shadowy
torchlit corridors up a stair to the upper
floor the warrior took him to the door
of their chambers bowed and left

  but clarks apparently owlish gaze
took in the fact that now there were a
score of armored guards posted unob-
trusively along the corridor outside their
chambers that showed that thargo was

still taking no chances-and that was
going to make things difficult

ephraim quell looked up in surprize
when clark stumbled into the torch-
lit rooms and slammed the door quells
eyes ran over clarks disordered hair and
flushed face and the girl lurain sitting
taut as a trapped tigress in a chair
watched with bitter contempt

  theres a book that says wine is a
mocker strong drink is raging 
twanged quell his bony face condemna-
tory figger you might ought to have
read that before you went down there
im not drunk clark rasped but
ive found out a lot and it adds up to the
total news that our lives are not worth
a plugged nickel if we stay around here
quell jumped to his feet in alarm
go down and get the others up
here clark told him dont appear too
urgent about it-but get them

  ephraim quell nodded tightly and
went out of the room clark stannard
went rapidly across the room to lurain

  clark s mind racing at top speed ever
since lie had discovered thargos con-
templated treachery had hit upon a des-
perate plan it was a hazardous one but
the only one as far as he could see that
would give him and his men a chance to
reach the lake of life now

  to stay longer in klamm would
merely allow thargo to make pawns of
them and then kill them there was but
one other possible course of action by
which they might win to the lake

  lurains blue eyes blazed hatred as
clark approached to her amazement
he cut her bonds

  lurain i must talk with you and talk
fast he said swiftly ive discovered
that thargo intends to kill me and my
men as soon as weve helped him con-
quer your city of dordona

  i am glad she blazed now you
the lake of life



learn the full evil of these red spawn
they will kill me but you also will die
listen you and your men came spy-
ing on klamm to learn when thargo
and his forces will attack your city didnt
you clark demanded heedless of her
hate well i can tell you that thargo
and his men will ride toward dordona
in four days

  four days whispered lurain her
face suddenly going dead white but
we did not dream he would attack so
soon-my people will be surprized-he
will overwhelm dordona

  exactly rasped clark he will un-
less we carry a warning to dordona
you mean you strangers will help me
escape help me warn dordona the girl
exclaimed with sudden desperate hope

  we will clark said grimly and
what is more we will fight on the side
of dordona in the coming battle you
have seen how powerful our weapons
are-it may be that our help will turn
the tide against klamm but for all
this there is a price

  what price for your aid lurain de-
manded

  the price clark told her is this
that when we reach dordona you shall
take me down the pit to the lake of
life so that i may fill a flask with its
shining waters to take back to the world
outside for that price i and my men
will aid your people

  no flamed lurain leaping erect
her face blazing with wrath by the
sun never will i pay that price ages on
ages have we of dordona faidifully
obeyed the commandments given us long
ago by the guardians below never have
we permitted one blasphemer to descend
to the lake to allow you to do so would
be supreme sacrilege i reject your pro-
posal i would rather die

  but dordona will die too if it is not
warned clark pointed out yes all its

  people will perish when thargo leads the
armies to klamm into the city in sur-
prize attack and then thargo will be
able to descend to the lake and drink of
it

  the guardians are there and will
destroy thargo and liis horde if they
dare descend lurain retorted fiercely

  are you so sure the guardians are
there clark said are you sure they
exist none in your city has seen them
for ages

  the guardians are there complete
unshakable faith of generations rang in
the girls voice though thargo and his
spawn doubt their existence they exist
and still wrard the sacred lake their
powers are vast and they will slay any
who approaches the lake doubt it not

  but then why not agree to let me
descend to the lake clark pressed
quickly if the guardians are there they
will not let me touch the shining waters
anyway will they the blame will not
be yours for you warned me and by
agreeing to let me go down there you
will save dordona from surprize and
death

  lurains face expressed doubt hesita-
tion agony for her imperilled city clark
hung on her answer he was hoping
the girls blind faith in the legended
guardians of the lake was strong enough
so that she would agree to let him go
as she supposed to his death

  she said finally her voice low and
shaken it is true that the guardians
will kill you when you descend to the
lake the sin of letting you descend
there will be on my soul but-dordona
will be warned in time to prepare for
thargos attack

yes i agree she continued with
desperate resolution on her face help
me escape from klamm promise to give
my city your help in the coming war
and when we reach dordona i will show


weird tales

you how you may descend the sacred
shaft

  good clark exclaimed his heart
quickening with excitement now if we
can just get safely out of klamm-

the door opened and ephraim quell
grimly entered followed by clarks
other four followers mike shinn was
fighting drunk bawling a song his bat-
tered face glistening link wilson too
was flushed with wine but lieutenant
morrow and blacky cain were sober-the
first because the drink had not affected
him the second from abstinence

   whats the lay chief rasped blacky
something wrong

  a lot wrong clark snapped he
told them in curt sentences of thargos
plot a vicious oath ripped from the
gangster

  double-crossing us eh well go
down and put the blast on him damn
him

   sure ill choke the dirty scut with
me bare hands raged mike shinn furi-
ously

  listen clark rapped well have
all we can do to escape this trap with-
out bothering for revenge on thargo
were going to get out of here at once-
and join the people of dordona

   rapidly he told them of the agreement
he had made with lurain the dordonan
girl stood tense and pale as he talked

   its a great idea exclaimed blacky
the gangster laughed well hand
thargo a double-cross and when we get
to this other burg dordona we can easy
lift the water from the lake below

  how are we going to get out of
klamm lieutenant morrow asked
quickly how out of this palace even

  we cant go down through the palace
itself clark said emphatically the
guards posted out there in the corridor

  would give the alarm theres the way
well have to take out

  he pointed to one of the big open
windows that looked out across the dark
city and the starry sky

  well slide down from that window
on a rope of some kind clark said
quickly behind the palace i noticed a
court where the horses of the palace
guards are evidently kept at night if we
can sneak back there and get mounts
well make a dash out through the city
thats the idea approved link wil-
son his eyes lighting we can ride right
out through these kombres

  what if the gates of the city wall are
closed morrow asked

  clark shrugged t dont think they
will be i doubt if they close those gates
every night-this city fears no attack
from dordona

  the six adventurers acted rapidly
while ephraim quell listened watch-
fully at the door clark and the others
tore down the wall hangings and con-
verted them into heavy knotted rope
they tied the end of the rope to a heavy
chest then dropped it into the darkness
outside

  the men quickly shouldered their
packs clark peered from the window
there were no sentries in the palace
yard immediately beneath though he
heard movement of some at the front of
the building the walled courts in the
rear of the palace were silent except for
an occasional stamping of the restless
horses back there

clark hung for a moment transfixed
by the weird beauty of the scene
the moon was rising above the mountain
wall in the east a flood of silvery light
pouring across the prisoned land and
bathed in the moon slept the city
klamm a sea of dully gleaming roofs
and streets and squares solemn and
the lake of life



somber bulked the dark mountains
crouched above die city then clark
stannard snapped out of the spell

  come on that moonlight will make
it harder for us he whispered urgently
lurain you follow me closely

  yes stannar she whispered ap-
proximating as closely as she could the
name she had heard the others call him

  clark swung over the stone window-
rail and slid softly down the knotted
rope through the moonlight to the
ground he poised there in the shadow
gun in hand no sound broke the sleep-
ing hush

  now lurain was following her black
metal-mesh tunic gleaming in the silver
moon mike shinn and lieutenant mor-
row came after and in a moment they all
stood in the shadow of the looming
palace wall their pistols glinting in their
hands

  they moved at once toward the rear
of the sleeping palace stepping sound-
lessly on the stone paving there seemed
no guards outside the big building
neither were there any outside the broad
wooden door of the walled horse-court
the door creaked and  they slipped
inside

  there were a score of horses in the
court and as the strangers entered the
animals stamped nervously tossed their
heads suspiciously in the moonlight
clarks gaze searched the court desper-
ately but it was link wilson who spot-
ted the saddles and bridles hanging on
a rail at one side of the court quickly
they grasped these and approached the
restless horses

  the horses snorted stamped wheeled
away with hoofs ringing loudly on the
paving clark cursed inwardly as they
again approached the nervous steeds
link wilson talked to the horses in a
low soothing monotone as he advanced
the ex-cowboy was soon saddling one

of them and morrow too and also lurain
had got others to stand still clark
noticed that the girl worked as silently
and swiftly as any of the men her face
showing no particle of fear in the silver
light his heart warmed again to her
proud unwavering courage

  he got one of the restive horses by the
mane and quickly attached the high
queer saddle and the rude bridle quell
also managed to saddle one but mike
shinn and blacky were having the devils
own time hanging onto horses that had
begun to plunge and rear

  help mike link whispered clark
quickly to the texan as the other
obeyed clark hurried to aid the gang-
ster leading his own saddled steed

  this damned goat has got the devil
himself in him whispered blacky furi-
ously as clark reached him i wish we
had a good eight-cylinder jaloppy for the
getaway instead of these plugs

  clark grabbed the saddle from the
gangster and threw it over the plunging
rearing animal

  guards cried lurain suddenly her
silver voice stabbing

  clark whirled still holding the mane
of the plunging horse two armored
guards attracted by the commotion in the
horse-court stood framed in the half-
opened door staring then with a yell
of alarm drawing their swords they
rushed forward

  blacky cains automatic sprang into his
hand and with a snarl on his lips the
gangster shot the reports cracked in
close succession and the two charging
soldiers fell in heaps

  that ties it cried the gangster
now we got to crash our way out

  more guards come called lurains
high voice completely calm and unfear-
ful but urgent as she snatched up one of
the swords of the fallen men

  the yell of alarm had been repeated


weird tales

near the looming palace and there was a
clank of running men clark stannard
fought furiously to tie the girths of the
struggling horse he finally succeeded
and then he yelled to blacky cain

  here you are mount at once all of
you

  now an uproar was spreading through
the whole pile of the hexagonal palace
and shouts and clash of arms could be
heard from all around it converging on
the horse-court

  clark swung into the saddle as he
jerked the reins to control the rearing
animal he saw that outside the horse-
court a scattered body of twenty or
thirty red guards were rushing forward
with drawn swords gleaming in the
moonlight

  well have to break out through
them clark yelled ride

  and he dug his heels into his steeds
flanks the nervous animal needed no
further urging and sprang forward
toward the door with hoofs clanging on
the pavement right beside clark rode
link wilson the texan sitting easily in
the saddle the rest thundering after

  straight into the scattered band of
guards at the door of the court they rode
clark glimpsed their drawn swords then
heard the boom of a gun beside him
over the din of hoofs and yells link
wilson had drawn one of his forty-fives
and was shooting as they charged three
of the guards slumped down as the heavy
slugs hit them

  they crashed th rough the other guards
a mad whirlwind of riders and steeds
the soldiers and stabbing swords seem-
ing to spin around them then with the
swiftness of a cinema film they were
through the soldiers riding full tilt
around the big palace toward the great
avenue that led to the city wall

  other guards ran wildly out from the
palace swords raised in the moonlight
clark had his own gun out now and
fired and heard link wilsons pistol
booming again he saw lurain bending
low over her mounts neck and slashing
at a guard whose spear struck toward
her the man went down and she rode
right over him and the little band raced
clattering down the wide street of the
awakening city

  the spawn of klamm cannot stand
against us stannar cried lurains silver
pealing voice as she rode

  yippee yelled link wilson the ex-
cowboy drunk with reckless excitement
as his horse galloped furiously over the
paving

  the whole city is rousing shouted
lieutenant morrow spurring his horse
beside clarks

  they thundered down that wide dark
street to the accompaniment of mad yells
of rage from behind them and startled
cries along the street a few men ran
out as though to intercept them but re-
coiled abruptly as the desperate little
band rode down on them

  clanging of hoofs on stone chorus of
yells and orders were wild music in
clark stannards ears as he and his men
and the dordonan girl thundered down
the street of moonlit klamm he saw
torches flickering and bobbing ahead of
them

  look yelled ephraim quell sud-
denly over the din the gates-

  faster cried clark wildly as he
sawr at what the yankee skipper pointed

  the great gates in the city wall had
been open as clark had guessed but
now alarmed by the clamor at the dis-
tant palace the guards around those gates
were hastily pushing against the mighty
bronze valves were closing them
the lake of life



 dordona

  if they close those gates were
  trapped yelled clark

  they spurred desperately forward
from the guard-towers on either side of
the gate several dozen soldiers had run
out and formed a line in front of the
gate behind that line a half-dozen other
red warriors were slowly forcing the
great valves shut

  ride through them clark shouted
its now or never

  they crashed into that solid line of
guards-and stopped for these soldiers
grabbed their bridles and stirrups and
clung to them holding them stabbing at
them with their swords the crazed
horses whirled and plunged in a mad
inferno of struggle the riders rising like
swimmers above a wave of armored men
and slashing swords

  clark felt a blade sear along his fore-
arm and glimpsed the brutal face of the
red warrior stabbing at him his gun
kicked in his hand and the man fell with
his forehead driven in clark shot again
trying to clear away the men clinging to
his bridle link wilsons heavy gun was
booming while blacky cain his eyes
blazing and a frozen killer mask on his
face was viciously shooting the men
trying to pull him down

  dordona dordona pealed a silver
cry from the girl lurain wielding her
sword with wildcat swiftness and fury

  the gates were almost closed and
from far back at the palace of thargo
masses of soldiers were coming on the
run clark had a cold sinking sense that
they were trapped then he heard a
hoarse cry

  out of my way you scum ephraim
quell shouted forcing through his at-
tackers clubbing his reversed gun on
their heads

  quell broke through them clark

saw the bony yankee skipper break
through on his mount to the half-dozen
men who now had pushed the gates
within a foot of closing ephraim quells
gun-butt smashed down among them sent
them reeling his horse trampling them
the yankee leaped from his horse
swiftly pulled on one of the great valves

  he pulled it open a few yards by fren-
zied tremendous effort but the men he
had scattered were on their feet again
rushing at him and stabbing with their
swords quell reeled back from them

  clark shouted his voice ringing over
the mad din and the others heard and
pushed desperately forward the horses
maddened by the struggle to the pitch of
frenzy surged forward crazily toward
the gate-opening that promised freedom
trampling down the clinging guards

  clarks gun blazed the last of its clip
and the men stabbing at quell fell link
wilson spurred in grabbed the yankee
skippers horse helped haul the bony
seaman up onto it then before the
guards they had broken through could
reach them again their horses were bolt-
ing out through the opened gates wild
from the battle and unaccustomed gun-
fire they plunged for freedom clarks
and lurains steeds jamming momentarily
in the narrow opening

  then they were all out in the open
moonlight of the plain the dark walls
and confusion and raging shouts of
klamm behind them plunging racing
snorting the horses galloped wildly over
the moonlit sea of grass and brush the
wild uproar of the red city receded
swiftly

  which way to dordona cried clark
to lurain shouting to her over the rush
of wind

  we follow the way now she cried
due east from here it lies-we go to the
river and along it to my city

  now the horses were settling to a


weird tales

steady rushing lope as their frenzy of
panic quieted a little clark turned in
the saddle but there was no sign of pur-
suit as yet from klamm

  but none of them had escaped un-
scathed mike shinn had a bleeding cut
on his forehead blacky cain had one
sleeve slashed to ribbons the rest all had
small cut or stab wounds only ephraim
quell riding grimly forward with jacket
buttoned tightly against the wind ap-
peared to have escaped without injury

  clark leaned toward the dordonan
girl riding close beside him lurain had
a cut across one bare knee but it was not
serious as they galloped she looked
tautly back to where klamm had
dropped from sight in the moonlight

  they will try to follow but they can-
not trail us by night and they dare not
go too close to dordona in small parties
she said then she laughed i would
like to see thargos face now

  ahead in the dim moonlight there soon
loomed vaguely a long low line of dark
trees it marked the river and they
reached it in a quarter-hour the dull
roar of the stream was loud as it raced
with the swiftness of a mountain-flume
toward dordona

   as they rode along it heading east the
first gray streak of dawn showed ahead
clarks hopes were soaring every beat
of the hoofs brought them nearer to dor-
dona where lay the pit that was entrance
to the lake of life hed yet succeed in
reaching it-lie had the girls word now
that he could descend to it

ephraim quell suddenly toppled
stiffly from his horse they reined in
hastily and clark ran to the yankees
side quells bony face was a ghastly
stiff mask his eyes closed from under
his coat welled a dark stain and when
clark ripped the coat open he saw that

beneath it had been concealed two deep
sword-wounds

  good god quell was badly wounded
when he kept the gate from closing but
lie said nothing to us clark exclaimed

  ephraim quells glazed eyes flickered
at clarks drawn tense countenance a
smile glimmered in them

  im-bout ready to cast anchor
quell muttered felt the life running
out of me as i rode-

  quell youre not dying clark said
desperately well get you to dordona
and pull you through

  no im done for whispered the sea-
man and-i dont mind ever since
my ship burned and they took my certifi-
cate i-havent cared much about liv-
ing

  his glazed eyes fixed on the eastern
sky pale with dawn a cool breeze had
begun to blow from there stirring the
grass the yankee skippers lips moved
almost inaudibly

  fair skies and a good wind - to-
day- he whispered then his head

lolled laxly his eyes dull dead

  clark let him down and got to his feet
there was a hard lump in his throat but
he made his voice harsh

  mike-blacky-keep a watch to the
south and west link and morrow and i
will bury him

  in the paling dawn they scooped a
grave under a tree beside the roaring
river using a little camp-spade from one
of the packs white mists of morning
made everything unreal as they put ephra-
im quells stiff body into the shallow
grave and covered it

  mount forward clark ordered

  again they galloped hoofs thudding
above the river roar bearing them on
through swirling white mists

  im kind of glad said link wilsons
drawling voice finally that we buried
him where he can hear water
the lake of life



  yeah muttered mike shinn quell
was a good guy he was a great guy

  an hour later lurain suddenly reined
in her horse and pointed eagerly ahead

  there is dordona

  five miles ahead rose the eastern wall
of the great crater the mighty looming
barrier of the mountains close under the
frowning cliffs brooded ancient crum-
bling dordona black silent brooding
like a withered ancient who has long ago
fallen from greatness it lay in the chill
white mists strange contrast to the city
from which they had come

  behind the black battlements of an en-
circling wall whose top had crumbled at
places rose a mass of antique towers and
roofs of dull black stone weathered by
the winds and rains of ages under a
water-gate in the dilapidated wall ran the
roaring mill-race river they had fol-
lowed it ran straight toward a building
at the center of the city a huge black
dome that towered two hundred feet into
the air

  the gates in the black wall were
pushed open as they approached soldiers
in black armor waved their swords in the
air and yelled joyful greetings to lurain
riding now at the head of the little troop
and as they rode on into the city from
somber crumbling buildings poured men
and women with shouts of gladness

  lurain the princess lurain has re-
turned they shouted

  clark stannard looking about keenly
saw that indeed dordona had long passed
the zenith of its glory many of the black
stone buildings were untenanted falling
to ruins green grass grew between the
blocks of black paving in the streets

  and the people pouring forth were not
nearly so numerous as the reds he saw
clark sensed despair under their momen-
tary joy read hopelessness on their pale
faces the hopelessness of great fear

  say well be the white-haired boys in

this joint for bringing back the girl
mike shinn said happily

  there arent enough men here to de-
fend this city properly lieutenant mor-
row told clark keenly the place is too
big now for its population and the wall
hasnt been kept up

  clark nodded grimly from what
thargo said the population of this place
has been steadily dwindling for a long
time

  we go to die temple of the shaft
lurain called to clark my father the
lord kimor will be there

  they rode after her toward the huge
black-domed temple that brooded at the
center of the city it loomed massively in
front of them incomparably the largest
and most ancient building they had seen
in this land for it was old the stone
paving in front of it worn deep by ages
of tramping feet its slot-windows crum-
bling at the edges

guards took their horses and swung
open die high bronze doors of the
temple lurain led the way inside her
slim boyish figure striding widi her
sheathed sword rattling on the stone floor
clark and his men following her inside
paused for a moment thunderstruck

  the interior of the temple was one co-
lossal room dim and dusky and vast its
only illumination shafts of sunlight from
the slot-like window-s and it was throb-
bing and quivering to a thunder of bel-
lowing sound that was deafening an un-
broken tremendous roar of waters

  the racing river from outside ran right
into the temple through a gap in one
wall the waters rushed with blinding
speed across die floor of the vast room in
a deep wide canal towrard a round black
opening a hundred feet across that
yawned at the center of the floor into
this gaping abyss the river tumbled with
a reverberating thunder


weird tales

  clark and his men moved nearer die
pit stood on the very edge of the abyss
he peered down into an impenetrable
darkness that seemed to go down to the
bowels of the earth he could make out
that the vertical sides of the pit were of
rough rock in which had been carved the
steps of a narrow spiraling stair the
head of this stair was closed by a barred
gate guarded by black warriors and the
raging cataract of waters leaping out over
the edge of the pit tumbled down its
center in a tremendous waterfall drop-
ping into the dark

  good god this must be the way
down to the cavern far below-to the
lake of life exclaimed clark stupefi-
edly

  say i dont hanker to go down
there said mike shinn awed it looks
to me like the doorway down to purga-
tory

  lurain was coming around the edge of
the pit now bringing with her a half-
dozen dordonan men in black armor

  my father stannar she said

  clark turned to confront kimor the
ruler of dordona

  kimor was sixty years old at least a
tall arrow-straight superbly muscled man
with white hair and pointed white beard
and fierce shaggy white eyebrows over
keen watchful blue eyes

  strangers you are welcome he told
clark my daughter has told me how
you helped her escape klamm and bring
us warning of the attack which thargo
plans for three days hence we expected
no attack for weeks-there is hardly time
to prepare

  we of dordona will be grateful for
your help in die coming battle kimor
continued lurain informs me you are
from outside the mountains and bear
weapons of great and strange power
you can aid us much and any reward we
can give you will be yours

  why we ask but one reward clark
said looking puzzledly at lurain it is
what i told your daughter-that we be
allowed to go down that stair in the pit to
the lake of life and bring back a flask
of its waters for that reward we have
joined you

  kimors fierce face turned dead-white
as he heard his eyes blazed fire of out-
raged fanatical fury and he ripped out
his sword from its sheath and from the
dordonans behind him came wrathful
raging cries as they too drew their weap-
ons their faces contorted

  you ask that thundered kimor to
clark you ask leave from us to commit
the supreme sacrilege that no man may
commit and live your very request is a
sacrilege to this temple of the shaft
nobles of dordona kill these men for
their blasphemy

 down the stair

blacky cains gun leaped into his
hands and the others followed his
example swiftly as the dordonan warri-
ors leaped forward with upraised swords
wild wrath on their faces

dont shoot clark yelled tensely

  for lurain had sprung in front of the
charging nobles and her fanatical father
halting them with an urgent gesture

  wait she cried these are stran-
gers from outside our land-they do not
know that it is blasphemy they speak
they will not ask for such a thing when
they understand that it is a sacrilege

  so this clark grated to the girl is
how you keep the bargain you made with
me

  i do not understand you stranger
she said coldly and turned back to ki-
mor you will forgive their ignorance
father

  they should be slain for such blas-
phemy said kimor fiercely but slowly
the lake of life



reluctantly he sheathed his sword and
said they are forgiven because they are
strangers who know not the law but let
them repeat their blasphemy let them
even but glance at the sacred shaft and it
shall mean their deaths

  looks like the girls double-crossed
usj rasped blacky cain shall we try to
crash our way down into that pit it
looks like suicide to me to go down that
damned stair but well do it if you say

  put away your guns clark said
quickly to the gangster and the others
there are too many of them here for
us and the whole city would come run-
ning later on we may be able to enter
the pit

  then he turned back to kimor and lu-
rain the girl showed no sign of emotion
as she met his bitterly accusing gaze

  we withdraw our request since it is
against your law clark told the fierce
old dordonan ruler

  well that you do said kimor grim-
ly for i tell you no man for ages has
been permitted to enter the sacred shaft

  he continued you shall be given a
dwelling for your use and food and
wine if you wish to help us against the
reds your help is welcome but whether
you help or not you cannot go near this
pit you are forbidden from now on to
enter this temple under pain of death

  we understand clark said tightly
his gaze again sought lurains face
charged with his bitter scorn

  two of the black-armored warriors at
kimors command led clark and his men
out of the temple they conducted them
along the crumbling streets whose occu-
pants watched the strangers curiously

  clarks thoughts were bitter lurain
had tricked him neatly-had had no in-
tention of fulfilling the promise she had
made him they were here in dordona
but as far from the shining lake as ever

  the two dordonan guides left them

outside a weathered one-story building
of black stone with a promise that food
and drink would be brought them the
interior of the building they found when
they entered was one of dark gloomy
rooms its furniture and floor covered
with dust everything here exuding an-
tiquity

  just as lief bed down in a mauso-
leum grunted mike shinn in disgust as
he tossed his pack into a corner and sat
down

  what lieutenant morrow asked
clark keenly are we going to do now
were going to get into that pit
somehow by force or stealth clark de-
clared well wait until tonight steal
into the temple and overpower the
guards at the head of the stair then we
can get down the shaft and i think
theyre too superstitious to pursue us

  but theyll be waitin for us when
w-e come back up reminded link wil-
son that is if we do come back up

   it will be up to us then to fight our
way through them clark said grimly
he added bitterly lurain broke her bar-
gain with us so our promise to help them
in the coming war no longer holds if
we get back up with the flask of water
from the lake well get out of dordona
as soon as we can

the day passed slowly clark stan-
nard and his men went out into the
streets of the crumbling black city for a
time apparently they sauntered idly but
in reality were mapping a route to the
temple one that they could follow with
less chance of being observed he noticed
the dordonan people now shunned them
looking at them in half-veiled hate
news of their blasphemy had apparently
spread in the city

  night fell and clark watched the
moon rise over the ancient city then
after some hours had passed he led the


weird tales

others into the dark back rooms of dieir
dwelling intending to slip out that way
but as he entered the darkness there he
glimpsed a moving figure in the black-
ness instantly he leaped at the other
grasped him by the throat

  its a spy he grated if theyve
found out what were planning were
sunk and he rasped in the language of
dordona to his prisoner one shout and
you die

  release me - i will not shout
gasped a voice

  lurain he exclaimed what in the
world-

  he dragged the girl over to one of the
windows where the moonlight illumi-
nated her white strange face and distend-
ed eyes

  what are you doing spying on us
clark demanded his face hardening as he
remembered

  no i came to fulfill the promise i
made you to lead you down to the holy
lake she gasped her words poured
forth in a torrent as clark stood in
stunned surprize stannar why did you
tell my father kimor you wished to de-
scend to the lake that was madness

  but you had promised me that you
would see that i got down the shaft
clark said bewilderedly

  you do not understand lurain told
him i made that promise yes-but
what i meant was that i would secretly
take you down the shaft for if my father
knew of it he would slay us instantly for
the sacrilege-yes even me his daughter
i thought you understood that and would
be silent about the lake until i could ful-
fill my promise

  lord ive misjudged you lurain
clark told her impulsively come to
think of it it was rather asinine of me to
blurt out my whole business without mak-
ing sure how things stood but i hadnt

had time to think i guess in the rush of
our escape

  and i had to pretend ignorance when
you reproached me she said but i have
come now stannar i shall fulfill my
promise and take you down to the cavern
of the lake of life the sin will be on
my head not on my father and people
and my sin will be expiated for surely
the guardians will slay us down there for
our sacrilege

  she was trembling violently though
her voice was steady clark stannard
stared at her frowning

  you believe that-believe were both
going to die down there lurain and
yet youre willing to keep your promise

  yes die girl told him i gave you
my word and you brought warning to
dordona as you promised my death mat-
ters not

  clark suddenly put his arms around
her and as he held her quivering figure
he could feel the pounding of her heart

  lurain youre not going to die-
neither of us will die he told her reas-
suringly there are no guardians down
there-that is legend only even if they
were there i have my weapon

  she said nothing but he knew she was
convinced of the futility of all human
weapons against those mysterious ward-
ers he turned to his four men who had
listened tensely in the dark room

  youll stay here clark told them
i should be back by morning with the
waters from the lake if all goes well
why dont we go with you blacky
demanded

  but when lurain understood the ques-
tion she shook her head no i prom-
ised but to take you stannar your men
would only be destroyed down there as
we will be and their help will be needed
here when thargo comes to attack dor-
dona

  remember youre bound by my

                     w t-
the lake of life



promise to help these blacks against
thargo clark told his men whether
or not i return

  then clark brought from his pack the
leaden flask he had brought so far along
such a dangerous trail in preparation for
this time he paused then for a moment
before the silent quartet

  good luck boys if i dont come
back he said

  the same to you chief and its me
thinks youre going to need it muttered
mike shinn as they shook hands

  we go out the back of this dwelling
whispered lurain to clark follow me
-and be very silent

  he emerged with her into the check-
ered moonlight and shadow of one of
dordonas silent streets the girl he saw
now carried a short pointed metal bar
she led by deserted alleys of crumbling
ruins not toward the great temple but
toward a ruined deserted stone building
a quarter-milc from the great dome

clark followed her wonderingly into
die ruin she led across a room
strewn with debris of crumbling stone
and knelt on die corner of the stone floor
he knelt puzzledly beside her turning
his tiny flashlight beam on the weathered
blocks of the floor

  dig out these blocks whispered lu-
rain pointing to the floor i will hold
the light

  but i dont- clark began then

halted and obeyed it was evident diat
lurain knew what she was about

  with the metal bar she had brought he
soon dug out four of the big blocks
there was revealed beneath them a dark
burrow-like opening in the earth the
mouth of a horizontal underground pas-
sage lurain dropped quickly down into
diis and clark followed turning his
beam he discovered the passage was
v t-

shoulder-high extending away through
die solid rock

  this passage lurain whispered
was dug secretly many generations ago
by plotters in the city who wished to
reach the pit and go down the stairs to
the lake of life they were of the rebels
of that time who finally left dordona to
found the city klaipm they could not
enter the pit from the temple for the
stair-head there is always guarded as you
saw so they dug this passage opening
into the pit below

  just as they finished their sacrilegious
work she continued their plot was de-
tected they were slain before they could
make use of die passage and it was
blocked up and its existence kept secret
but the rulers of dordona have known
of it and as daughter of the present ruler
i knew of it it is the one way we can
enter the pit for if we tried to enter it in
the temple die guards there would kill
us at once

  clarks hopes bounded lets get on
then

  he led the way flashing his beam
ahead as they advanced in the passage
they heard a dull roar that became louder
and louder clark knew it was the sound
of the cataract falling into the sacred
shaft and his excitement increased lu-
rain pressing on behind him was shiver-
ing

  they reached the end of the passage
they crouched petrified by the stupefy-
ing view ahead the opening in which
they crouched was twenty feet below the
floor of the temple in the rock side of the
stupendous pit right below and outside
diis opening lay the narrow steps of the
spiraling stone stair

  out there in the pit not ten yards from
them there gleamed in the faint light
from above the falling waters of the thun-
dering cataract the river from far away
tiiat tumbled headlong down into this un-


weird tales

guessable abyss its roar seemed to shat-
ter their ears and its flying spray was cold
on their white faces

  clark gripped his nerves and crawled
out onto the stone steps the steps were
not four feet wide grown with the
slimy green moss of ages drenched and
dripping with spray looking up he
could just glimpse the moonlit interior
of the great temple could just see the
heads of the armored guards on duty at
the head of the stair

  looking down he could see nothing-
nothing but an unplumbed abyss of dark-
ness into which the waters tumbled and
round whose side dropped the coils of the
spiral stair clarks nerves shrank ap-
palled for the moment from the thought
of venturing down into that enigmatic
gulf along that slippery ancient way
then his jaw set in renewed resolution
below lay what he had come so far to
seek

  lurain we go downward now he
told the girl raising his voice over the
roar would you rather wait here

  no stannar-i go with you she
cried my promise was to lead you to
the lake itself

  cautiously every nerve strung taut
clark stepped downward feeling with
his foot for the next step he dared not
use the flashlight here so near the sur-
face the wet mossy stone was slippery
under his feet threatening to send him
slipping and sliding off the unrailed stair
sick dizziness swept him as he visualized
himself plunging downward racing those
tumbling waters in a nightmare fall

  now he and lurain had followed the
spiral stair twice around che falling cata-
ract were deeper below the surface they
were in almost complete darkness spray
stung their cheeks gusty air-currents
howled up the great shaft the thunder of
the falling waters beside them was brain-
numbing still down and down they
crept feeling for each slippery step grop-
ing down through somber eternal night
toward the mystic lake of life and its
legended warders

dancers

by manly wade wellman

a curious and terrifying story about an artist who sold his soul that he
might paint a living picture

had come to the art museum to
see the special show of goya prints
but that particular gallery was so
crowded that  could hardly get in much
less see or savor anything wherefore i
walked out again i wandered through
the other wings with their rows and rows
of oils their greek and roman sculp-
tures their stern ranks of medieval ar-
mors their oriental porcelains their egyp-
tian gods at length by chance and not
by design i came to the head of a certain
rear stairway other habitues of the mu-
seum will know the one i mean when i
remind them that arnold bocklins the
isle of the dead hangs on the wall of the
landing

  i started dow-n relishing in advance
the impression bocklins picture would
make with its high brown rocks and black
poplars its midnight sky and gloomy
film of sea its single white figure erect
in the bow of the beadi-nosing skiff
but as i descended i saw that the isle
of the dead was not in its accustomed
position on the wall in that space ar-
resting even in the bad light and from
the up-angle of the stairs hung a gilt-
framed painting i had never seen or
heard of in all my museum-haunting
years

  i gazed at it one will imagine all the
way down to the landing then i had a
close searching look and a final apprais-
ing stare from the lip of the landing
above the lower half of the flight so far
as i can learn-and i have been diligent
in my researdi-the thing is unknown

even to the best-informed of art experts
perhaps it is as well that i describe it in
detail

  it seemed to represent action upon a
small plateau or table rock drab and
bare with a twilight sky deepening into
a starless evening this setting restrain-
edly worked up in blue-grays and blue-
blacks was not the first thing to catdi the
eye however the front of the picture
w-as filled with lively dancing creatures
as pink plump and naked as cherubs
and as patently evil as the meditations of
satan in his rare idle moments

  i counted those dancers there were
twelve of them ranged in a half-circle
and they were cavorting in evident glee
around a central object-a prone cross
which appeared to be made of two stout
logs with some of the bark still upon
them to this cross a pair of the pink
things-that makes fourteen-kneeling
and swinging blocky-looking hammers or
mauls spiked a human figure

  i say human when i speak of that fig-
ure and i withhold the word in describ-
ing the dancers and their hammer-wield-
ing fellows there is a reason the su-
pine victim on the cross was a beautifully
represented male body as clear and anat-
omically correct as an illustration in a sur-
gical textbook the head was writhed
around as if in pain and i could not
see the face or its expression but in the
tortured tenseness of the muscles in the
slat white sheen of the skin with jagged
streaks of vivid gore upon it agonized
nature wras plain and doubly plain i

                                    


weird tales

could almost see the painted limbs writhe
against the transfixing nails

  by the same token the dancers and
hammerers were so dynamically done as
to seem half in motion before my eyes
so muclf for the sound skill of the
painter yet where the crucified prisoner
was all clarity these others were all fog
no lines no angles no muscles-their
features could not be seen or sensed i
was not even sure if they had hair or not
it was as if each was picked out with a ray
of light in that surrounding dusk light
that revealed and yet shimmered indis-
tinctly light too that had absolutely
nothing of comfort or honesty in it

oid on there came a sharp chal-
lenge from the stairs behind and
below me what are you doing and
whats that picture doing

  i started so that i almost lost my foot-
ing and fell upon the speaker-one of
the museum guards he was a slight old
fellow and his thin hair was gray but he
advanced upon me with all the righteous
angry pluck of a beefy policeman his
attitude surprized and nettled me

  i was going to ask somebody that
same question i told him as austerely as
i could manage what about this pic-
ture i thought there was a bocklin hang-
ing here

  the guard relaxed his forbidding at-
titude at first sound of my voice oh i
beg your pardon sir i thought you were
somebody else-the man who brought
that thing he nodded at the picture
and the hostile glare came back into his
eyes it so happened that he talked to
me first then to the curator said it was
art-great art-and the museum must
have it he lifted his shoulders in a
shrug or a shudder personally i think
its plain beastly

  so it was i grew aware as i looked at

it again and the museum has accepted
it at last i prompted

  he shook his head oh no sir an
hour ago he was at the back door with
that nasty daub there under his arm i
heard part of the argument he got in-
sulting and he was told to clear out and
take his picture with him but he must
have got in here somehow and hung it
himself walking close to the painting
as gingerly as though he expected the
pink dancers to leap out at him he
pointed to the lower edge of the frame
if it was a real museum piece wed
have a plate right there with the name
of the painter and the title

  i too came close there was no plate
just as the guard had said but in the
lower left-hand corner of the canvas were
sprawling capitals pale paint on the dark
spelling out the word golgotha be-
neath these in small barely readable
script

  i sold my soul that i might paint a
living picture

  no signature or other clue to the ar-
tists identity

  the guard had discovered a great
framed rectangle against the wall to one
side heres the picture he took down
he informed me highly relieved help
me put it back will you sir and do
you suppose here he grew almost wist-
ful that we could get rid of this other
thing before someone finds i let the crazy
fool slip past me

  i took one edge of the isle of the
dead and lifted it to help him hang it
once more

  tell you what i offered on sudden
impulse ill take this golgotha piece
home with me if you like

  would you do that he almost
yelled out in his joy at the suggestion
would you to oblige me

  to oblige myself i returned i
need another picture at my place
the golgotha dancers



  and the upshot of it was he smug-
gled me and the unwanted painting out
of the museum never mind how i
have done quite enough as it is to jeop-
ardize his job and my own welcome up
there

it was not until i had paid off my taxi
and lugged the unwieldy parallelo-
gram of canvas and wood upstairs to my
bachelor apartment that i bothered to
wonder if it might be valuable i never
did find out but from the first i was
deeply impressed

  hung over my own fireplace it looked
as large and living as a scene glimpsed
through a window or perhaps on a stage
in a theater the capering pink bodies
caught new lights from my lamp lights
that glossed and intensified their shape
and color but did not reveal any new de-
tails i pored once more over the cryptic
legend i sold my soul that i might paint
a living picture

  a living picture-was it that i could
not answer for all my honest delight in
such things i cannot be called expert or
even knowing as regards art did i even
like the golgotha painting i could not
be sure of that either and the rest of
the inscription about selling a soul i
was considerably intrigued by that and
let my thoughts ramble on the subject of
satanist complexes and the vagaries of
half-crazy painters as i read that eve-
ning i glanced up again and again at my
new possession sometimes it seemed ri-
diculous sometimes sinister shortly after
midnight i rose gazed once more and
then turned out the parlor lamp for a
moment or so it seemed i could see
those dancers so many dim-pink silhou-
ettes in the sudden darkness i went to
the kitchen for a bit of whisky and water
and thence to my bedroom

  i had dreams in them i was a boy
again and my mother and sister were

leaving the house to go to a theater where
-think of it-richard mansfield would
play bean brummell i the youngest was
told to stay at home and mind the troub-
lesome furnace i wept copiously in my
disappointed loneliness and then mans-
field himself stalked in in full brum-
mell regalia he laughed goldenly and
stretched out his hand in warm greeting
i the lad of my dreams put out my own
hand then was frightened when he
would not loosen his grasp i tugged
and he laughed again the gold of his
laughter turned suddenly hard cold i
tugged with all my strength and woke

  something held me tight by the wrist

  in my first half-moment of wakeful-
ness i was aware that die room was filled
widi the pink dancers of the picture in
nimble fierce-happy motion they were
man-size too or nearly so visible in the
dark with the dim radiance of fox-fire
on die small scale of the painting they
had seemed no more than babyishly
plump now they were gross like huge
erect toads and as i awakened fully
they were closing in a menacing ring of
them around my bed one stood at my
right side and its grip clumsy and rub-
bery-hard like that of a monkey was
closed upon my arm

  i saw and sensed all this as i say in a
single moment with the sensing came
the realization of peril so great that i
did not stop to wonder at the uncanniness
of my visitors i tried frantically to jerk
loose for the moment i did not succeed
and as i thrashed about throwing my
body nearly across the bed a second
dancer dashed in from the left it seized
and clamped my other arm i felt rather
dian heard a wave of soft wordless mer-
riment from them all my heart and sin-
ews seemed to fail and briefly i lay still
in a daze of horror pinned down cruci-
fix-fashion between my two captors


weird tales

  was that a hammer raised above me as
i sprawled

  there rushed and swelled into me the
sudden startled strength that sometimes
favors the desperate i screamed like any
wild tiling caught in a trap rolled some-
how out of bed and to my feet one of
the beings i shook off and the other i
dashed against the bureau freed i made
for the bedroom door and the front of
the apartment stumbling and staggering
on fear-weakened legs

  one of the dim-shining pink things
barred my way at the very threshold and
the others were closing in behind as if
for a sudden rush i flung my right fist
with all my strength and weight the
being bobbed back unresistingly before
my smash like a rubber toy floating
through water i plunged past reached
the entry and fumbled for the knob of
the outer door

  they were all about me then their
rubber palms fumbling at my shoulders
my elbows my pajama jacket they
would have dragged me down before i
could negotiate the lock a racking shud-
der possessed me and seemed to flick
them clear then i stumbled against a
stand and purely by good luck my hand
fell upon a bamboo walking-stick i
yelled again in truly hysterical fierceness
and laid about me as with a whip my
blows did little or no damage to those
unearthly assailants but they shrank back
teetering and dancing to a safe distance
again i had the sense that they were
laughing mocking for the moment i
had beaten them off but they were sure
of me in the end just then my groping
free hand pressed a switch the entry
sprang into light

  on the instant they were not there

somebody was knocking outside and
with trembling fingers i turned the
knob of the door in came a tall slender

girl with a blue lounging-robe caught
hurriedly around her her bright hair
was disordered as though she had just
sprung from her bed

  is someone sick she asked in a
breathless voice i live down the hall-
i heard cries her round blue eyes were
studying my face which must have been
ghastly pale you see im a trained
nurse and perhaps-

  thank god you did come i broke
in unceremoniously but honestly and
went before her to turn on ever lamp in
the parlor

  it was she who without guidance
searched out my whisky and siphon and
mixed for me a highball of grateful
strength my teeth rang nervously on the
edge of the glass as i gulped it down
after that i got my own robe-a becom-
ing one with satin facings-and sat with
her on the divan to tell of my adventure
when i had finished she gazed long at
the painting of the dancers then back at
me her eyes like two chips of the april
sky were full of concern and she held
her rosy lower lip between her teeth i
thought that she was wonderfully pretty

  what a perfectly terrible nightmare
she said

  it was no nightmare i protested

  she smiled and argued the point tell-
ing me all manner of comforting things
about mental associations and their re-
flections in vivid dreams

  to clinch her point she turned to the
painting

  this line about a living picture is
the peg on which your slumbering mind
hung the whole fabric she suggested
her slender fingertip toudiing the painted
scribble your very literal subconscious
self didnt understand that the artist
meant his picture would live only figura-
tively

  are you sure thats what the artist
meant i asked but finally i let her con-
the golgotha dancers



vince me one can imagine how badly i
wanted to be convinced

  she mixed me another highball and a
short one for herself over it she told me
her name miss dolby-and finally she
left me with a last comforting assurance
but nightmare or no i did not sleep
again that night i sat in the parlor
among the lamps smoking and dipping
into book after book countless times i
felt my gaze drawn back to the painting
over the fireplace with the cross and the
nail-pierced wretch and the shimmering
pink dancers

  after the rising sun had filled the
apartment with its honest light and cheer
i felt considerably calmer i slept all
morning and in the afternoon was dis-
posed to agree with miss dolby that the
whole business had been a bad dream
nothing more dressing i went down
the hall knocked on her door and invited
her to dinner with me

  it was a good dinner afterward we
went to an amusing motion picture with
charles butterworth in it as i remember
after bidding her good-night i went to
my own place undressed and in bed i
lay awake my late morning slumber
made my eyes slow to close thus it was
that t heard the faint shuffle of feet and
sitting up against my pillows saw the
glowing silhouettes of the golgotha
dancers alive and magnified they were
creeping into my bedroom

  i did not hesitate or shrink this time
i sprang up tense and defiant

  no you dont i yelled at them as
they seemed to hesitate before the impact
of my wild voice i charged frantically
for a moment i scattered them and got
through the bedroom door as on the pre-
vious night there was another shindy
in the entry this time they all got hold
of me like a pack of hounds and wres-
tled me back against the wall i writhe
even now when i think of the unearthly

hardness of their little gripping paws
two on each arm were spread-eagling me
upon the plaster the cruciform position
again

  i swore yelled and kicked one of
them was in the way of my foot he
floated back unhurt that was their
strength and horror-their ability to go
flabby and non-resistant under smashing
flattening blows something tickled my
palm pricked it the point of a
spike   

  miss dolby i shrieked as a child
might call for its mother help miss
d-

  the door flew open i must not have
locked it here i am came her un-
afraid reply

  she was outlined against the rectangle
of light from the hall my assailants let
go of me to dance toward her she
gasped but did not scream i staggered
along the wall touched a light-switch
and the parlor just beyond us flared into
visibility miss dolby and i ran in to the
lamp rallying there as stone-age folk
must have rallied at their fire to face the
monsters of the night i looked at her
she was still fully dressed as i had left
her apparently had been sitting up her
rouge made flat patches on her pale
cheeks but her eyes were level

this time the dancers did not retreat
or vanish they lurked in the com-
parative gloom of the entry jigging and
trembling as if mustering their powers
and resolutions for another rush at us

  you see i chattered out to her it
wasnt a nightmare

  she spoke not in reply but as if to
herself they have no faces she whis-
pered no faces in the half-light
that was diffused upon them from our
lamp they presented the featurelessness of
so many huge gingerbread boys covered
with pink icing one of them some kind


weird tales

of leader pressed forward within the
circle of the light it daunted him a bit
he hesitated but did not retreat

  from my center table miss dolby had
picked up a bright paper-cutter she
poised it with the assurance of one who
knows how to handle cutting instruments

  when they come she said steadily
lets stand close together well be
harder to drag down that way

  i wanted to shout my admiration of
her fearless front toward the dreadful be-
ings my thankfulness for her quick run
to my rescue all i could mumble was
youre mighty brave

  she turned for a moment to look at the
picture above my dying fire my eyes fol-
lowed hers i think i expected to see a
blank canvas - find that the painted
dancers had vanished from it and had
grown into the living ones but they
were still in the picture and the cross
and the victim were there too miss
dolby read aloud the inscription

  tra living picture    the artist knew
what he was talking about after all
couldnt a living picture be killed
i wondered

  it sounded uncertain and a childish
quibble to boot but miss dolby ex-
claimed triumphantly as at an inspira-
tion

  killed yes she shouted she
sprang at the picture darting out with
the paper-cutter the point ripped into
one of the central figures in the dancing
semicircle

  all the crowd in the entry seemed to
give a concerted throb as of startled pro-
test i swung heart racing to front them
again what had happened something
had changed i saw the intrepid leader
had vanished no he had not drawn
back into the group he had vanished

  miss dolby too had seen she struck
again gashed the painted representation
of another dancer and this time the

vanishing happened before my eyes a
creature at the rear of the group went out
of existence as suddenly and completely
as though a light had blinked out

  the others driven by their danger
rushed

  i met them feet planted i tried to
embrace them all at once went over back-
ward under them i struck wrenched
tore i think i even bit something grisly
and bloodless like fungoid tissue but i
refuse to remember for certain one or
two of the forms struggled past me and
grappled miss dolby i struggled to my
feet and pulled diem back from her
there were not so many swarming after
me now i fought hard before they got
me down again and miss dolby kept
tearing and stabbing at the canvas-
again again clutches melted from my
throat my arms there were only two
dancers left i flung them back and rose
only one left then none

  they were gone gone into nowhere

  that did it said miss dolby breath-
lessly

  she had pulled the picture down it
was only a frame now with ragged rib-
bons of canvas dangling from it

  i snatched it out of her hands and
direw it upon die coals of the fire

  look i urged her joyfully its
burning thats the end do you see

  yes i see she answered slowly
some fiend-ridden artist-his evil ge-
nius brought it to life

  the inscription is the literal truth
then i supplied

  truth no more she bent to watch
the burning as the painted figures
were destroyed their incarnations faded

  we said nothing furdier but sat down
together and gazed as the flames ate the
last thread of fabric the last splinter of
wood finally we looked up again and
smiled at each other

  all at once i knew that i loved her

by h w guernsey

an ironic little story about a practical communist who taught his
friend when to take him seriously

chauncey knocked the dottle
out of his corncob and briefly
startled old shep by inquiring
unemotionally will you never finish
that blasted stick

  which in old chauncey was tanta-
mount to fury words being precious
things both old boys hoarded every
syllable shep tightened his leathery lips
and with the scalpel-point of the knife
flicked away a mote of pine each link of
the chain he was whittling from that in-
terminable stick of soft pine resembled
ivory in its satin finish he might produce
one link in a day or let it require a full
week no hurry the current chain num-
bered four hundred and seventy-two
links a masterpiece

  under sheps surreptitious scrutiny
old chauncey stood erect purposefully
and stalked to the woodpile there a fat
log stood on end with one swift seem-
ingly effortless stroke of die ax he cleft
the log in two spat explosively and
hiked into the house wagging his jaw

  the log-built house a jewel of consci-
entious carpentry stood on the wooded
elevation called st pauls hill near
town on die side hill one hundred and
twenty feet below stood another log-built
affair formerly die ice-house since old
shep had become chaunceys permanent
guest this structure had been equipped
with furnishings as complete and com-
fortable as the house including plumb-
ing so there was no reason for shep to
hang around old chaunceys kitchen
the housekeeper celia lilleoden per-

formed die chores incidental to both
houses -with such easy efficiency that old
chauncey was repeatedly reminded of his
bachelorhood from continually sunning
themselves behind the kitchen like two
old snakes the men had acquired a
wrinkled black-walnut finish but celia
still retained the firm buxom ripeness of
an apple

  as a practical communist old chaun-
cey kept his latch-key out by inclination
his generosity was limitless

  thus old shep did not have to ask
for anything he wanted it was share and
share alike

  for example he charged tobacco to
old chaunceys account at die store in
town he always had if he preferred a
grade of tobacco superior to what old
giauncey himself used sudi was his
privilege a plug is a plug

  shep and chauncey once had occupied
the same double desk of raw cherrywood
in the schoolhouse which was now a
weedy hill of rubble and rotten wood a
half-mile out on the backroad

  besides words old shep hoarded to-
bacco plugs in case the cause of commun-
ism ever collapsed

  in accordance with this sdieme of liv-
ing old chauncey gradually became ac-
customed to being spared the nuisance of
opening the occasional letter he received
from another old soldier fh sacketts
harbor newr york at first shep had
gone to the trouble of sneaking the mail
down to the ice-house and steaming it
open but currently the mail arrived slit


weird tales

open without any subterfuge the knife
incidentally was the better of old
chaunceys two shep had borrowed it
knowing that in communism there can be
no indian giving

  on one occasion chauncey accosted
old shep behind the kitchen with a
crumpled letter in his fingers

  shep he suggested casually i wish
youd slit my letters open at the top in-
stead of an end it wouldnt bunch the
writing up so much when you shove it
back inside

  chauncey old shep replied tremb-
lingly youre not serious with me are
you if you want to keep secrets from
your old crony why you just tell me seri-
ously not to open those letters any more
and i wont

  it used to give chauncey a funny feel-
ing when old shep talked like that

of a somnolent summer morning
while chauncey was scrubbing his
long yellow teedi he glimpsed blurred
movement through the starched white
bathroom curtain tweaking the curtain
somewhat aside he witnessed old shep
scampering down the side hill to the ice-
house with a load of kindling in his
arms

  til be dog-goned swore old
chauncey with toothpaste foam dribbling
down his chin he complains he cant
do his chopping on account of his rheu-
matism and look at the old turkey go i
see where i chop kindling for both of us
from now on

  when old shep showed up to get in a
few licks of whittling before breakfast
chauncey inquired hows that rheu-
matism

  fierce chauncey im getting mighty
creaky

  well help yourself to my kindling

shep long as i know where its disap-
pearing to i dont give a durn

  thanks chauncey thanks i knew
youd feel that way

  the bacon eggs and delicately crusty
fried potatoes hit the palate so ambrosial-
ly that after breakfast chauncey was se-
duced into the disastrous error of men-
tioning to shep the chances of marrying
miss lilleoden error for it was only
human nature to covet the goods which
another man prized most

  thenceforward old shep neglected his
whittling or idled awkwardly with it in
the kitchen where a housekeeper spends
most of her time chauncey observed
blackly that old shep had a cunning way
with him too

  durn it chauncey ruminated dis-
mally everything i want he gets if i
tell him to stay away from her he wont
take me seriously the old hoodoo always
has his way anyhow his durned
whittling is out of my sight

befell a morning when old shep
didnt appear and chauncey found
him stretched out stiff half-way down the
side hill in sheps vulturine right fist
was clenched a small crumple of bills
this pilfering had occurred with such
regularity that the companion of chaun-
ceys childhood had accumulated just
about enough to get started with celia
lilleoden

  chauncey asked the coroner a glisten-
ing little round man like a wet dumpling
is he dead

  of course hes dead said the cor-
oner obviously

  he has no kin celia reminded old
chauncey in her slow soft contralto

  ill do him one more favor chaun-
cey offered unblinkingly he can have
my lot in the cemetry
here lies



  the lot in dream hill cemetery meas-
ured eight feet long five feet wide and
ten feet deep meaning that it had been
excavated and ready for occupancy these
past five years the walls were common
brick on the floor was a stone bed to
lie on whimsically chauncey had also
installed a small table furnished with a
tobacco bag and pipe matches an alarm
clock with an illuminated dial and an
ashtray and a thick plumbers candle
the old pagan

  anchored in the foot-wall of this cell
ladder-like were iron rungs whidi had
enabled him on past occasions to descend
and inspect his subterranean property
as on this occasion he made the trip to
deposit sheps unfinished wooden chain

  the stone slab sealing the cell had
long been cut with the dangerous adver-
tisement here lies chauncey
dautreville whose worldly
goods were any mans for
the asking

  naturally a new inscription had to
be chiseled

  but there aint any more room in that
piece chauncey the stone-cutter ob-
jected you want nother stone

  turn it upside down and cut it in
the bottom old chauncey directed
with that topside staring him in the
face liell have something to read in the
hereafter

  the underside becoming the face car-
ried the inscription here lies shep-
ard frankenfield who feels
no anxiety for the future
nor regret for the past

  on the day preceding old sheps in-
terment old chauncey paid a visit to
die nearest justice of the peace with celia
lilleoden and no one thought it was in
the least peculiar as chauncey balanced
accounts with himself the state would
otherwise inherit his property eventually

as was right but he wished to insure
celias staying on as his housekeeper in
which capacity she beggared superlatives

  while four huskies furnished by the
undertaker replaced die granite sheet
over the brick chamber old chauncey
recollected the particulars of a certain fit
of sheps dating about five years before
shortly before celia that catalepsy or
whatever it was had gripped shep as
though in deatli for nearly three days un-
til old chauncey had thought of making
a brassy rumpus next to his ear with the
big dinner bell the alarm clock in the
subterranean mausoleum was set for
eleven oclock terminating a like period
of time when old shep might be ex-
pected to wake up and yawn in the here-
after just a whim of chaunceys since
the coroner had pronounced old shep
indisputably defunct

  late that night celia surmised wor-
riedly that her absent husband might be
visiting the tomb of his lifelong crony
and there he was in the sickly forest of
tombstones hunkering down on sheps
horizontal tombstone like a boy watching
a game of marbles

  but he was listening not watching
he knocked again on the slab with his
bony knuckles cocked his head listening
for the response while the lazy breeze
lifted his silken gray hair in the starry
cave of night he asked cele do you
hear him down there

  celias gentle mind recoiled from the
idea diat the dead might rise in answer
to a human summons the stoically re-
strained grief for his departed friend
must have touched her husband some-
what in the head

  on the fifth night chauncey observed
that old sheps ghost must be getting
tuckered out

  celia decided that there was a limit to
indulgence


weird tales

  chauncey she ordered firmly you
mustnt come down here any more
youll be taking pneumonia

  he accepted the order without protest

  maybe that he commented to the
frankly puzzled mrs old chauncey
will teach the old grasshopper when to
take a man seriously

uhe s

of mrs debrugh

by h sivia

air debrugb ivas dead but he still regarded his promise
as a sacred duty to be carried out

t etty mr debrugh remarked
between long puffs on his meer-
schaum youve been a fine
maid youve served mrs debrugh and
me for most of fifteen years now i
havent much more time in this life and
i want you to know that after mrs de-
brugh and i are gone you will be well
taken care of

  letty stopped her dusting of the chairs
in mr debrughs oak-paneled study
she sighed and turned toward the man
who sat on a heavy sofa puffing on his
pipe and gazing across the room into
nothingness

  you mustnt talk that way mr de-
brugh she said  you know youre a
long time from the dark ways yet she
paused and then went on dusting and
talking again and me-humph-ive
only done what any ordinary human
wrould do to such a kind employer as you
sir especially after all youve done for
me

  he didnt say anything and she went
on with her work of course she liked to
work for him she had adored the kindly
old man since first she had met him in an
agency fifteen years before a person
couldnt ask for a better master

  but there was the mistress mrs de-
brugh it was she who gave letty cause
for worry what with her nagging
tongue and her sharp rebukes it was a
wonder letty had not quit long before

  she would have quit too but there
had been the terrible sickness she had
undergone and conquered with the aid
of the ablest physicians mr debrugh
could engage she couldnt quit after
that no matter what misery mrs de-
brugh heaped on her and so she went
about her work at all hours never tiring
always striving to please

  she left the study closing the great
door silently behind her for old mr
debrugh had sunk deeper into the sofa
into the realms of peaceful sleep and
she did not wish to disturb him

  letty came the shrill cry of mrs
debrugh from down the hall get these
pictures and take them to the attic at
once and tell mr debrugh to come
here

  letty went for die pictures

  mr debrugh is asleep she said
explaining why she was not obeying the
last command

  well ill soon fix that lazy old
man sleeps all day with that smelly pipe
the last of mrs debrugh



between his teeth if he had an ounce
of pep about him hed get out and work
the flowers sleeps too much anyway
not good for him

  she stamped out of the room and down
the hall and letty heard her open the
door of the study and scream at her
husband

  hector debrugh wake up

  there wras a silence during which
letty wondered what was going on then
she heard the noisy clop-clop of mrs de-
brugh s slippers on the hardwood floor
of the study and she knew the woman
was going to shake the daylights out of
mr debrugh and frighten him into
wakefulness she could even imagine she
heard mrs debrugh grasp the lapels of
her husbands coat and shake him back
and forth against the chair

  then she heard the scream it came
quite abruptly from mrs debrugh in the
study and it frightened letty out of her
wits momentarily after that there was
the thud of a falling body and the clatter
of an upset piece of furniture

  letty hurried out of the room into the
hall and through the open door of the
study she saw mrs debrugh slumped
on the floor in a faint and beside her an
upset ash-tray but her eyes did not
linger on the woman nor the tray in-
stead they focussed on die still form of
mr debrugh in the sofa

  he was slumped down his head
twisted to one side and his mouth hang-
ing open from the shaking mrs de-
brugh had given him the meerschaum
had slipped from between his teeth and
the cold ashes were scattered on his
trousers

  even then before the sea of tears be-
gan to flow from her eyes letty knew the
old man was dead she knew what he
had meant by the speech he had said to
her only a few minutes before

t tis heart was the comment of die
x j doctor who arrived a short time
later and pronounced the old man dead
he had to go today tomorrow soon

  after that he put mrs debrugh to
bed and turned to letty

  mrs debrugh is merely suffering
from a slight shock there is nothing
more that i can do when she awakens
see that she stays in bed for the rest of
the day

  he left then and letty felt a strange
coldness about the place something that
had not been there while mr debrugh
was alive

  she went downstairs and made several
telephone calls which she knew would
be necessary later when mrs debrugh
was feeling better other arrangements
could be made

  she straightened the furniture in the
study pushing the familiar sofa back in
place from where mr debrugh invari-
ably moved it then she knocked the
ashes from the meerschaum wiped it off
and placed it carefully in the little glass
cabinet on the wall where he always
kept it

  times would be different now she
knew she remembered what he had
said you will be well taken care of
but there had been something else
after mrs debrugh and i are gone

  letty could no longer hold back the
tears she fell into a chair and diey
poured forth

  but time always passes and with it
goes a healing balm for most all sor-
rows first there was the funeral then
came other arrangements and there was
the will which mrs debrugh never
mentioned

  his things would have fallen into de-
cay but for the hands of letty always
her dust-cloth made his study immacu-
late always the sofa was in place and


weird tales

the pipe clean and shining in the cab-
inet

  there was a different hardness about
mrs debrugh no longer was she con-
tent with driving letty like a slave day
in and day out she became even more
unbearable

  there were little things like taking
away her privilege of having saturday
afternoons off and the occasional for-
getting of lettys weekly pay

  once letty thought of leaving during
the night of packing her few clothes and
going for ever from the house but that
was foolish there was no place to go
and she was getting too old for maid
service

  besides hadnt mr debrugh said she
would be taken care of after airs de-
brugh and i are gone perhaps she
would not live much longer

  and then one morning mrs debrugh
called letty in to talk with her it was
the hour letty had been awaiting-and
dreading

  there was a harsh gloating tone in
mrs debrughs voice as she spoke she
was the master now there was no hec-
tor to think of

  lettr she said for some time now
i have been considering closing the
house im lonely here i intend to go
to the city and live with my sister so
you see i shant be needing you any
longer ill be leaving within the next
two days im srry

  letty was speechless she had expected
something terrible but not this this
wasnt so mrs debrugh was lying
it was the will she was afraid of letty
remembered mr debrughs promise

  she did not complain however her
only words were til leave tomorrow

  that night she packed her things she
had no definite plans but she hoped
something would turn up

sleep would not come easy so letty
lay in bed and thought of old mr de-
brugh she imagined he was before her
in the room reclining on the sofa puffing
long on the meerschaum she even saw
in fancy the curling wisps of gray smoke
drifting upward upward   

  it was sleep then with a start she
was suddenly wide awake

  she had surely heard a scream but
no

  and then as soft and as silent as the
night wind came the whisper letty

  it drifted slowly off into silence and a
cool breeze crossed her brow she sud-
denly felt wet with perspiration she
listened closely but the whisper was not
repeated

  then noiselessly she got out of bed
stepped into slippers and drew a robe
about her just as silently she left her
room and walked down the hall to mrs
debrughs bedroom

  she rapped softly on the door fearing
the wrath of the woman within at being
awakened in the middle of the night
there was no answer no sound from
inside the room

  lettr hesitated wondering what to do
and once more she felt that cool deadi-
like breeze and heard the faintest of
whispers fainter even than the sighing
of the night wind letty

  she opened the door and switched on
the light mrs debrugh lay in the bed
as in sleep but lett knew as she had
known about mr debrugh that it was
more than sleep

  she quickly called the doctor and
sometime much later he arrived his eyes
heavy from lack of sleep

  dead he remarked after looking
at the body probably had a shock
fright nightmare or something her
heart couldnt stand i always thought
she would have died first

  letty walked slowly from the room
the last of mrs debrugh

 

down the stairs still in her robe and slip-
pers the doctor followed and passed
her going through the door into the
outside

  she walked as though directed by
some unseen force into mr debrughs
study she switched on a lamp beside the
sofa on which he had always sat and she
noticed that it was moved slightly out of
place

  there was something else about the
room some memory of old days first
she saw some sort of legal document
on the table and wondered at its being

there the title said last will and
testament of hector a debrugh it
was brief she read it through and found
that mr debrugh had spoken truthfully
in his promise to her

  beside the will on the table was an-
other object and she knew then what
the something else in the room was

  the meerschaum it lay there beside
the document and a thin spiral of gray-
ish smoke rose upward from it toward
the ceiling

  no longer did letty wonder about
anything

on my bookshelf

   by elizabeth virginia raplee

	bony relic of forgotten days

which from my bookshelf dominates the room
your empty sockets with sardonic gaze

follow me weirdly in the deepening gloom

	often think if sudden speech returned

you might reveal that secret grisly jest

youre grinning at-or tell me what youve learned
of that dark realm to which were all addressed

by what rude hands were you exhumed and why
wrenched from your body in its earthy bed

who knows but such indignity will i
receive at other hands when i am dead

and strangely resurrected may adorn

curple cincture

by h thompson rich

it was a day in midsummer i re-
member i had been tramping over
the densely wooded and desolate
hillside the greater part of the morning
getting with each mile farther and farther
from the tawdry haunts of man and
nearer and nearer the rugged heart of
nature

  finally it must have been after noon-
time i paused and made a light lundi
of the sandwiches and cold coffee i had
brought with me from town sitting on
the edge of a great slab of granite rock
swept clean and smooth by ages of winds
and rains and snows

  all about me was a veritable garden
of great projecting rocks jagged and
broken flat and polished needle-like
giant flowers of earth in a thousand dif-
ferent forms

  here and diere a short dwarfed pine
or spruce tree struggled for a footing
amid its rocky friends and the resistless
undergrowth surged up through every
crack and crevice while energetic mosses
and lichens clutched at the granite walls
and crept bravely up one had a feeling
of awe as if in the presence of elemental

   from weird tales for august 

     

eternal forces here i thought if any-
where one might commune with the
voiceless void

  suddenly my eyes chanced to fall upon
a fissure in the rock to the left and i
sprang up with a low exclamation what
i had beheld was to all appearance a
human skeleton

  advancing reluctantly yet with that
insistent inquisitiveness which surrounds
die dead i bent and peered into the fis-
sure as i looked a cry escaped me the
object i beheld was indeed a skeleton-
but what a skeleton the head the left
hand and the foot were entirely missing
nor was there any sign of them at first
sight

  thoroughly fascinated by the morbid
spectacle i began a search for the miss-
ing members and was finally rewarded
by unearthing the head some twenty feet
away where it lay half buried in the soft
loam of decayed vegetation and sifted
chole but a painstaking and minute
hunt failed to reveal the missing hand
and foot

  i was successful however in finding
something immeasurably more important
the purple cincture



-a manuscript this i found by the side
of die mangled skeleton

  it consisted of several pages of closely
written material in a small pocket note-
book which fact in connection with the
partial shelter afforded by the crevice
where the body lay doubtless accounts
for its preservation through the years that
have passed since its owner met his hid-
eous fate

picking up the notebook with nerv-
ous fingers i opened it and turned
the damp and musty pages through read-
ing it at first hastily then slower and
more carefully then with a feverish con-
centration-as the awful significance of
the words was riveted into my brain

  the writing was in a mans cramped
agitated hand and i give it to you just as
i read it with the exception of the names
and places and a few paragraphs of vital
scientific data-all but a few words at
the very beginning and end where the
manuscript had been molded into illegi-
bility by the gradual action of die
weather here follows

  -as strange i had a sense of ap-
prehension from the start a vague in-
describable feeling of doubt of dread as
if someone somediing were urging me
out away into these sullen hills

   might have known the law of
retribution is as positive as the law of
gravity i know that now oh irony

  but i was so sure no one knew no
one could know she my wife heart of
all until the end and the neighbors her
friends never she had merely pined
away no one dreamed i had poisoned
her even when she died there was no
thought of autopsy she had long been
failing and had i not been most con-
cerned none in the little town of

- but who sympathized with me

and i mourned oh i mourned so it
    w t-

was that she paid the price of her infamy
ah but revenge never was sweeter

  and he oh but i despised him-
even as i had formerly admired him
even as i had once loved my wife-so
i despised him and despising him i
killed him-killed him but with a poi-
son far more subtle than that i had used
to destroy my wife-killed him with a
poison in effect so hideous so harrowing
that i can scarcely think of it without
sickening even as i write

  the poison i inculcated into his veins
was a germ poison-a disease i a physi-
cian of no small repute had discovered
and bred-a disease i had found existed
only in a particular and very rare species
of virulent purple and orange-banded

spider-the genus - here follow

in the original manuscript seven para-
graphs of elaborate scientific data of no
particular interest to the average reader
but of incalculable import to the scientific
world these paragraphs i have omitted
from diis account for very significant rea-
sons but i hold them open to scientific
examination at any time and as i have
said before i will welcome investigation
by reputable scientists-a disease which
was responsible for die extreme rarity of
this particular species

  by careful investigation i was able to
learn the exact manifestation and work-
ings of the disease-whidi by their
frightful ravages upon the system of the
unfortunate victim fairly appalled me

  by segregating and breeding diseased
members of this particular species of
spider i was able to produce the disease
in the young in its most virulent form
you can well imagine the care i used in
handling these spiders to prevent infec-
tion briefly the symptoms were as fol-
lows the spider about to be stricken ap-
parently first experiences a peculiar
numbness of the first left foreleg to
judge from its inability- to use or move


weird tales

the affected member a day or so later
the leg which in a healthy condition is a
dull brown turns a pale sickening shade
of yellow which deepens rapidly until it
has taken on a flaming orange hue then
in a few hours a deep vicious-looking
blue cincture or band appears just at the
first joint of the affected member this
cincture rapidly deepens to purple which
seems somehow to sear its way into the
flesh and through the bone so that in a
surprizingly short time die whole leg is
severed at the joint where the cincture
has been

  the spider then appears to regain its
normal condition of health which it
maintains for about a week then once
again the hideous disease manifests itself
this time in die left feeler or antenna
which in turn becomes yellow then
orange whereupon the same blue cinc-
ture appears and deepens to purple then
in about the same period of time as in the
case of the leg the antenna drops off
seared as if by some hellish flame

  once again the spider appears to re-
gain its health then in about a week the
whole head of the stricken insect turns
slowly yellow then orange then the
cincture appears-and as a last manifesta-
tion the head is seared off in flaming
agony-and the spider dies in horrible
convulsions

  that briefly is the process-as i was
able to note after weeks and months of
tireless research and observation

  so what more perfect punishment
for the man who stole from me my wife
while pretending to be my friend

t oving her as i did i had not the
j-rf heart to kill her in this hideous
way so i put her to death with a painless
and insidious poison

  but for - i had no mercy in

fact i gloated as i worked over my vile
and diseased spiders breeding them to-

gether until i was convinced that i had
the germs of the disease in its most viru-
lent form even then i was not sure
what their effect would be on a human
being-but that much at least i must
hazard

  so having finally made all my prep-
arations i invited him to my house and
placed one of the diseased spiders upon
his forehead one night as he slept

  it must have bitten him for he
awoke with a cry and i had barely time
to close his door and get back to my
room before i heard him rise and turn on
the light

  then he called me and i came to
him burning with a fiendish satisfaction
something has bitten me horribly he
said i feel as if i were going to be ill

  i managed to reassure him by telling
him that it was very likely nodiing but
one of our uncommonly large mosqui-
toes and he returned to bed

  but he did not sleep all night i
heard him moaning and tossing and in
the morning he was very pale

   i do not know what is die matter
with me he said and i thought he
looked at me queerly but i feel as if a
little rest would do me good i feel
choked i think i will pack up my knap-
sack and go off to die hills for the week-
end want to come

  i longed to go with him to see the
dread disease work but i feared its dead-
ly contagion and was anxious to get him
away before i myself became contam-
inated so i said no-and he went

  that was the last i ever saw of him
-but once

tt e went away as he had prom-
tjl ised and he seemed apparently
well-all except the curious little in-
flamed spot on his forehead whose sig-
nificance i knew so well

  he went away-and he failed to
the purple cincture



 come back days passed and there came
 no word from him people began inquir-
 ing it was odd that he should have left
 no address his business suffered

   weeks went by-and no word
 search parties were sent out the river
 was dragged the morgues of near-by
 cities were searched and all the while i
 laughed for who would think of turning
 to those far-off hills

    and yet as the days went by i found
 myself turning to them again-wonder-
ing wondering wondering i grew nerv-
ous agitated i got so i couldnt sleep

    finally on a day in late summer it
 was the th of august-date i shall
 never forget i packed a few things and
 set off in search of him god knows i
 tried to tell myself not-but at any rate
 t found myself strangely magnetically
 drawn to those distant somber hills-and
 thither i went

   it was one of those gorgeous morn-
 ings that only august can produce and
 the exhilarating air would have lifted my
 spirits but instead i walked along de-
 pressed and the knapsack strapped to my
 shoulder served only to intensify the
 feeling

    in spite of all i could do i found
 my mind reverting to the hideous revenge
 i had wreaked on my wife and her lover
 and for the first time repentance stole in
 upon me

   i walked along slowly and it was
 well toward noon before i left the beaten
 road and started at random off over the
 hills following a narrow and little-used
 path

   progress now became doubly slow
 and painful leading often up steep in-
 clines and hard descents with the aspect
 momentarily becoming more and more
 rugged as i left the lower hills and
 climbed toward the mountain

   by this time however i had got a
 kind of exhilaration sought in vain dur-

 ing the earlier hours of the morning and
 climbed on and on glad to free body and
 mind thus of the poison of brooding and
 lassitude i would return to the town at
 night and take supper at one of the small
 inns that abounded thereabouts this
 would give me some hours yet before i
 turned back for the time being the
 thought of searching for-was for-
 gotten i had freed my mind of him en-
 tirely

resently the path i had been fol-
jl lowing branched and the right half
narrowed into an all but obliterated trail
leading up a laborious slope forcing my
way over dry snapping underbrush and
under low-hanging spruce boughs occa-
sionally starting an indignant partridge
from its hidden nest often put to a wide
detour to avoid some hazardous gully
cut deep by centuries of spring and
autumn freshets i at last emerged upon
a small circular clearing evidently the
work of some lone wooddiopper

  here i sat down tired by the climb
and refreshed myself with a sandwich
from my knapsack then i pushed on to
the summit pausing frequently to ex-
amine some uncommon species of insect
life with which the hills abounded

  so much wras i enjoying myself and
such scant notice of the time did i take
that sunset came upon me unawares and
i found myself with darkness settling in
on all sides with a startling rapidity still
 the summit of the mountain with a
good three-mile descent before me in-
deed the prospect was not altogether a
cheering one and i reproached myself for
my heedlessness but i had found a
species of spider for which i had searched
in vain for months so somewhat reas-
sured by its precious body in a pill-box in
my pocket i started down

  in spite of my best speed however
night shut in on me before i had made


weird tales

one quarter of the return leaving me to
grope the rest of the way in utter dark-
ness with not even the light of a dim
star to go by vague fear awoke within
me but i shielded my eyes and stumbled
to the bottom sliding falling clutching
here and there at some projecting tree-
limb to check my headlong descent
finally torn and disheveled and shaking
i emerged upon the clearing pausing
only for breath i plunged on into the
dark fear was growing-growing-that
peculiar fear of the dark which is the
heritage of those who have taken human
life

  what was that something lay gleam-
ing queerly ahead with a dull phosphor-
escent glow i stooped and picked it up
-and flung it from me shuddering it
was the skeleton of a human foot

  i groped on my every heartbeat
choking at my throat of a sudden i
came forcefully against a barrier of rock
i tried to feel my way around it to get
beyond it but could not it seemed con-
tinuous a solid wall that would not let
me by had i fallen into a trap in die
darkness terrified i turned-and there
lay something else gleaming with that
same weird phosphorescent glow sick
with terror and dread half fearing what
it might be i sprang on it and picked it
up-picked it up-the rotting hand of a
human being with a stifled gasp i flung
it from me reeled tripped through some
vines and fell swooning

hen i came to myself i struck a
match and looked about me its
feeble flame revealed a pair of damp
rocky walls low and vaulted i was in
some sort of cavern

  later on  crept out collected an arm-
ful of sticks brought them back and
soon had a fire started by its light i ob-
served that the rear of die cave was still
in darkness and judging diat it must ex-

tend back indefinitely i gave my atten-
tion to my immediate surroundings-
when with a shock i saw directly in front
of me a granite slab on it lay several
loose sheets of manuscript scrawled wild-
ly on odd scraps of paper

  with a prophetic dread i bent for-
ward and gathered the loose sheets to-
gether holding them near the fire i
peered closer then i think a cry must
have escaped me the writing was in

-s hand curiously scrawled and

scraggy but still recognizable

  so fate had brought me to my victim

  for the rest there is little more to
say i am doomed as i deserve even as
he was doomed his words speak all that
can be spoken they follow

april th-i had meant to spend only
- the week-end in these hills yet here
 am after two weeks-still here and
suffering the pains of bell what has
come over me i cannot imagine and yet
-can i not i am not so sure perhaps

-perhaps - has in some devilish

way managed to poison me he is insane-
ly jealous he thinks there was some-
thing between his wife and me verily i
believe he harassed her to death on the
subject and having thus brought her to
her grave he wishes to send me there

  perhaps he will succeed-if it is true
that in some fiendish way he has got some
of his germs into my blood that bite
at his house that evening i am not so
sure it ivas a most unusual bite it
seemed upon the instant to sour ail my
blood

  and yet if he accomplishes my death
how vain it will be-for as god is my
witness i swear i never harmed his wife
we were the best of friends nothing
more and she loved him with a whole-
ness a passion that any but a man mad-
dened by groundless jealousy must at
once have seen
the purple cincture



  how he has wrecked his life a mind
so brilliant-and yet with her dead a
closed room

  however  may be wrong  will wait
by the symptoms i will know  write
this down for i must do something

  april th-it is he now bis hellish
work i am sure of it today my left
leg which for two weeks has felt posi-
tively numb turned a sickening yellow
from the ankle dotvn which began at
once to deepen until it now flames or-
ange and oh the pain is hellish yes 

am sure it is--s work but i will

still withhold judgment

  april th-today a deep virulent
blue cincture has appeared just at the
ankle of the affected leg what a hellish
contrast to the orange

 it is - i am sure now oh

what a fiend

  april th-the cincture has deep-
ened to purple and seems to cut into the
very flesh it seems sometimes as if the
pain would drive me mad

  april th-my flaming foot dropped
off tonight seared at the ankle by the
purple cincture and i flung it outside the
cave i wonder perhaps i may yet live
to return to the world ah i will be
avenged for this

  may rd- am cursed cursed to-
day just as i was beginning to believe
the hellish thing had left me it returned
this time in my left hand oh i can see
it all tomorrow and the next day and the
next for just two weeks my hand will be
numb then will come that frightful yel-
low then the orange then-then the
purple cincture

  curse the man who discovered this
hellish disease-and turned it into me

	could tear him limb from limb oh i

pray to return  would go now yet i
fear my malady is of a vilely contagious
nature i have not the heart to menace a
whole community perhaps a whole na-
tion perhaps humanity itself-merely to
avenge myself on one man

  june th-i was right this morn-
ing i awoke with my hand that death-
yellow oh it is too regular too certain
-too cruelly certain

 june th-thank god my hand is
gone-out there where my foot went it
happened tonight perhaps  may yet re-
turn perhaps i may yet be avenged i
wonder

  july st-doomed that fearful
numbness again-this time in my head
i cannot think- cannot write- can
scarcely breathe oh the pain - the
pain-

t t ere it ended in a sputter of ink

  ll	trembling in every limb filled
with a horror and anguish and remorse
no man can know spellbound by the aw-
ful tale those few sheets told i sat there
motionless

  so i had been wrong oh my jeal-
ousy my insane jealousy as i sat there
all desire of life suddenly left me and i
thrilled with joy at the remembrance of
the hand and foot i had come upon out-
side the cave they were his i had
touched them i was contaminated with
the dread disease

  what was that i listened straining
every nerve from the back of the cav-
ern had come a sound

  five minutes passed-ten-fifteen i
was oblivious of time-but it was not
repeated slightly i relaxed my aching
nerves and tried to think already i fan-
cied i could feel the fearful poison of the
diseased spider working in my veins

  suddenly the significance of that last


weird tales

entry in-s diary burst upon me

and i sat shivering as under a sudden del-
uge of icy water july st two weeks
more would make it august th and
three days more would bring it to-
august tb

   great god i cried aloud tonight
is the night

   yes tonight is the night echoed a
sepulchral voice from the caverns inner
darkness

  in an agony of dread i looked and
the blood within me paled to water at the
sight that met my gaze something-
something with but a single hand and
foot-emerged from the shadows of the
back of the cavern and began to come
forward leaning heavily upon a rough
staff for support

   stay back-stay back for the love
of god i shrieked but the terrible
thing came on and on and the awful eyes
fastened themselves upon my person and
suddenly recognized me-and it smiled a
hideous smile

  when it drew nearer i could see that
all above the shoulders flamed orange
wiiile around the neck a livid purple cinc-
ture seemed actually to be searing its way
into the flesh

    this is your revenge it spoke and
this is mine raising the hellish stump of

its mutilated left arm and panting heavily
at me my suffering is over-but yours
is all to come and to the bodily pains
of hell will be added the mental tortures
of hopeless remorse-knowing your wife
was innocent with that i curse you

  even as it spoke the eyes rolled out
of sight behind horrible lids the tongue
protruded itself in flaming agony and the
whole head suddenly severed at the neck
thudded upon the cavern floor

  i came to my feet with a mad cry
that shattering the silence beyond the
deepest shadows swelled up in a thou-
sand echoes from the wail of a soul in
torment to the screech of a crucified de-
mon then i rushed headlong out

  for the rest-

the last page was illegible as the first
had been worn and corroded by the
slow action of years of decay

  i put the notebook slowly in my pocket
and sat there thinking sickened and awed
by the astounding manuscript

  again i went over to the skeleton there
in the fissure now i understood why
the hand and foot were missing and why

i	had found the head many feet from the
body

  there it lay mute evidence that the
retribution was complete

the letter from g m wilson
printed below makes an astonishing
accusation against weird tales as-
tonishing because this magazine has often
been blamed for a policy the exact opposite
of that attributed to us by mr wilson he
says in effect that our stories lack interest
because the reader knows in advance that
they will all end happily the villain will be
defeated and virtue will triumph no matter
what odds are against such an ending we
recall that weird tales was once rebuked
by one of the magazines for writers because
of our publication of the seeds of death by
david h keller july  the story
was called immoral because the hero was
given over to a lingering death and the vil-
lainess succeeded in her evil schemes one
of our interplanetary stories was criticized by
some of our readers because the red-headed
reporter who had endeared himself to the
readers was killed on mars and could not
return to earth with die rest of the space-
traveling party a glance at the august
issue which is on the stands as this is writ-
ten shows at least four stories that refute
mr wilsons accusation against us in one
of these the will of the dead by loretta
burrough a scheming mother who had
dominated her sons life wrought a hideous
doom upon her innocent daughter-in-law
all of which makes a fascinating story but
does not allow virtue to triumph in another
the last pharaoh by thomas p kelley
the lovable english girl and her brother had
their bodies taken from them so that the
pharaoh and his paramour could acquire their
healthy bodies on which to transplant their
own heads-surely a defeat of all that is
good the evil deed is not undone either
even though destruction overtakes the guilty
pair at the last most of our stories do end
happily because chac is the way the authors

write them but our readers can never know
in advance whether the ending will be hap-
py or otherwise mr wilsons letter follows

does virtue always win

  g	m wilson whose letter we have
answered above writes from rosebank new
york i realize that this epistle is slated
for immediate deposit in the nethermost
depths of the wastebasket but nevertheless
i still am having the satisfaction of getting
something off my chest that has been both-
ering me for some time the point i am
bringing up is i suppose one of the un-
mentionables of die pulps it is to put it
tersely why must virtue always triumph i
read some years ago that a writer who
wished to achieve success with your type of
magazine must never let heroism be over-
come by villainy i see that your audiors
have taken this lesson to heart or perhaps
it is your editorial policy to accept only
stories which follow this category now
there is no doubt that your publication could
be one of the best escape mechanisms in
the literary field however it becomes mo-
notonous to an extreme after the first two
issues the remedy is simple you need only
to vary your menu slightly your authors
display enough ingenuity and skill your
field that of the uncanny is interesting in
fact you lack only the quality of variety to
elevate your magazine far above the pulp
class why not let the reader have some
reasonable doubt as to whether the fair-
haired boy will conquer the nasty villain or

weird tales

you publish stories of the extraordinary but
god it is too extraordinary to stomach hav-
ing right win continually it isnt life you
may say that you are not writing about life
that i can get my sordid realism in the con-
temporary fiction of die hemingway school
but i think you can get my point the point
is that you have the makings of an excellent
magazine above the class of the usual pulp
yet you usually and deliberately tie yourself
down with this one flaw i suppose you are
a success financially and have a large reading
public but dont you think you could widen
your appeal and increase your circulation by
adopting the above suggestion no doubt
i am wrong for it is your business to know
the psychology of your reading public and
yet im not so sure im wrong i think
theres something in all of us that delights
in the exaltation of evil i am no publicity
hound but i think if you were to publish
this letter and ask for comments you would
find that many of your readers wrould agree
with me in any event if you could answer
me personally and state your reasons for
the exclusion of all stories in which the hero
doesnt triumph i should be grateful frank-
ly i am curious

save the necronomicon

  elaine mclntire of malden massachu-
setts writes madam brundage certainly
can draw but she doesnt make her femmes
look scared they are too beautiful i liked
virgil finlays cover last month hope he
does more soon that reminds me-is mr
ball going to give us more of raid prince
of thieves i sincerely wish he would yes
you shall have more raid stories-the
editor but what in tarnation is the ter-
rible parchment is our friend wellman
trying to put my pet book necronomicon on
the spot well hed better not try im up
in arms i like to think that there is such a
thing it gives me something to think about
coming home alone late at night along dark
streets what about it readers are we
going to let that pass     for myself i like
nice gray werewolf stories and the more
murky gory and slinky a story is the better
i like it

some suggestions

  lawrence miller of norfolk virginia
writes the stories in your magazine are
all good you have no kiisks coming but

i have several suggestions diat would tend
to make the magazine perfect the first
why such a stria policy in your reprint de-
partment as matters stand weird tales
readers are given only the shorter stories
from your back issues werent there some
praiseworthy longer ones of course there
is die old cry against long reprints-authors
must eat-but you could easily circumvcnt
that when you plan to reprint a novelette
merely skip a reprint for one montii and
make up for it the second month or use
smaller type after all the type in the eyrie
has not harmed my eyes the second idea
concerns those two great writers who died
recendy-lovecraft and howard for a long
time they carried the burden of writing
weird tales largely between them and the
great majority of your readers has probably
never seen either of them how about pic-
tures a photograph of each carried inside
your cover make good likenesses of them
they deserve it and have no writing on
the picture if necessary charge extra for
that particular issue or skip the other il-
lustrations or even skip the stories but
give us those photographs i will close with
an appreciation of henry kuttner he is the
most versatile artist to ever appear in weird
tales the jest of droom avista is every
bit as good as the eater of souls which up
to last month was the best ever printed he
is one of the twro really worthwhile weird
poets the other is-or was-edgar allan
poe lets have another as good as ragna-
rok

trudy answers our critics

  gertrude hemken of chicago writes
comes my monthly gab-letter to aggervate
and praps delight you fustest of all i
must express my complete and wholly satis-
factory pleasure at the abyss under the
world gracious me i still feel as though
i had been awakened from a strange and
charming dream-particularly that tour along
the spur with the chasm below-soundless
and depthless-now i want to go back to
sleep and continue that dream only i know
i must wait still there is a satisfaction that
the story will be completed whereas a real
dream from which one awakens seldomly is

the rivet-studded oaken door crashed open splintering from the assault of pike-butts
whose thunderous echoes still rolled around the walls of the tiny stone room re-
vealed beyond the wreck of the shattered door jirel the warrior-maid of joiry
leaped in through die splintered ruins dashing die red hair from her eyes grinning with
effort gripping her two-edged sword but in the ruin of the door she paused the mail-
clad men at her heels surged around her in the doorway like a wave of blue-bright steel
and then paused too staring

   for franga the warlock was kneeling in his chapel and to see franga on his knees was
like watching the devil recite a paternoster but it was no holy altar before which the wiz-
ard bent the black stone of it bulked huge in this tiny bare room echoing still widi the
thunder of battle and in the split-second between the doors fall and jirels crashing entry
through its ruins franga had crouched in a last desperate effort at-at what

    his bony shoulders beneath their ridi black robe heaved with frantic motion as he fin-
gered the small jet bosses that girdled the altars block a slab in the side of it fell open
abruptly as the wizard realizing that his enemy was almost within swords reach whirled
and crouched like a feral diing blazing light cold and unearthly streamed out from die
gap in the altar

    so diats where youve hidden it said jirel with a savage softness

    over his shoulder franga snarled at her pale lips writhing back from discolored teeth
physically he was terrified of her and his terror paralyzed him she saw him hesitate evi-
dently torn between his desire to snatch into safety what was hidden in the altar and his
panic fear of her sword diat dripped blood upon the stones

weird tales

the eyrie

        continued from page 
that mr suter is just dandy-the sample is
fine nextest i orter do something about
the finis of the last pharaoh-twamt bad
atall atall-somehow i really didnt feel bad
that lovely carol and her dear brother were
not restored to their original bodies but
muh gooness sakes warnt thet princess
atma die hungry gal she had a bad bad
case of the gimmies-wuss then some of
our gold diggers nope twarnt a bad
story at that- was wholly satisfied with it
from the start after all the villain was
defeated and that should be enough for any
reader sez i thank you mr kelley for 
some mighty entertaining reading  a
very queer tale was this thing of darkness
-i never hecrd tell of quite such a ghost
before he really was a rotter i must say

i liked the unusual note of the old mrs
burdens sacrificing herself that a ghost
might be laid rather unusual form of
exorcism-isnt it the mandarins ear was
rather refreshing in its lightness-almost
humorous in that the ear of another could
hear all about its former possessor quite an
idea diat finlays illustration is nice too
although i cant say die beauty looks very
chinese eurasian more or less with a
strong inclination to the russian loretta
burrough has something there the will of
the dead is a fine example of what some
mothers would like to do to their sons
wives some mothers are intensely jealous
of their sons dont say me nay-i know
this mother in the tale was a tyrant no
less    and so henry kuttner tells us
dis is a city of iron sounds like bad pro-
nunciation to me tsk tsk-hk yes sir
live and learn live and learn sez i-the old
alchemists never learned to make precious
metals of baser products and those who suc-
ceeded-well look at droom avista-as
also king midas i just wonder if mr
wellman believes that his necronomicon
story to end all n stories will really end
them somehow i wish it would-i could
never get myself to pronounce the word
correctly and id have it wandering in my
brain popping into my thoughts at the most
unweird limes shall we wait and see if it
really is the end of all n stories mr w 
now to die eyrie-its high time i start

stepping on a few toes and giving boosts to
others first an orchid to j z thompson
who wrote from glendale california-i
liked his catchy phrase-pulse-pepping
mrs h l phillips of quincy illinois
seems so very prosaic in her statement of the
magazine being in general very interesting
mrs p-that sounds mudi too polite-why
dont you whack down a real stacement and
say i think its just the bestest of all the
bestest and-well its just the nuts no less
or dont you understand my language i
agree with robert j hoyer of my own fair
and windy city that doctor lamontaine is a
fine character for a yarn-one of those rip-
roaring topers-yet a he-man-and entirely
lovable we will have more of him wont
we t o mabbott is going to get a toe-
trodding-perhaps it would be better for
him to reread clicking red heels-the
young millionaire did have more than one
pair of shoes and the story ends that in
every pair of his shoes were found these
strange clicking devices-the question i
raised in regard to that was how the dooce
anyone could get hold of all his shoes and
insert those clickers as for the question of
the hollow appearing on the seat beside the
young man in his roadster-well dont you
my friend have an imagination dont you
know that when a person wants to and yet
fears to he will see what is not there such
was the case with the young millionaire
or perhaps mr ernst can explain it better
than i that will be all this time-i am
happy to see seabury quinn again for next
month i am also awaiting the meeting of
jirel and nwsmith quite anxiously

a threadbare theme

  clifton hall of los angeles writes
strangely enough the thing that has caused
me to break the ice and pen my first letter
to die eyrie is the fact diat i find that your
august issue falls short in my estimation
of your usual high standard of excellence
the cover itself was the first thing to give
me this impression it seemed rather care-
lessly done then too where are all the
pretty nudes that once made wt so attrac-
tive and readable all of my wt-fan
friends here in los angeles agree with me
that the wt of two years ago was made far
more entertaining by the well-done nudes
that featured the cover and stories there is
certainly nothing pornographic about it all
weird tales



artists agree that a well-done nude is the
highest form of artistic expression and
finlay and brundage-especially the former
-seem capable of doing them well but
back to the magazine itself i dont think
im unfair to thing of darkness the fea-
tured story when i say that it has the old-
est spooky-story plot on the face of the
globe since die time of charles dickens-
and where he got it i cant say-it has been
used so many times in books plays short-
stories movies radio dramas etc etc that
you could get out a magazine of twice the
thickness of wt every week from now to
 a d and still not reprint more than
half of them this is the only one that real-
ly got my ire up but there were several
others that i thought rather mediocre the
abyss under the world seemed to be writ-
ten more in the style of a pulp detective
thriller than a real weird story and per-
haps im being a bit hasty inasmuch as there
is another installment to be printed but isnt
it a bit strange that the egyptians under the
ground should speak nothing but english
i thought world of the dark dwellers was
pretty good although die idea of mechanical

masters who had once been men living
underground and preying on the light
dwellers is strangely like h g wells
the time machine i enjoyed the man-
darins ear the last pharaohand the love-
craft reprint though and according to die
trailer of next months issue wt seems
destined to return to its former high level
heres hoping

weird tales

writes obi stories as he used to do west
indies haiti voodooism witchcraft-no-
body can match his flawless literary style and
tingling terms arlton eadie the teller of
ghost stories par excellence howard how-
ard die great the incomparable the master
howard whose tales were breathless sagas
snatched vibrant with life from the mouths
of the scalds of old howard who lifted his
diaracters out of the dust and decay of
times long forgotten breathed eager lusting
laughing fighting life into them clapped
swords in their fists and sent them tramping
the witch-haunted battle-strewn roads men
every one revelling in life and its joys wine
women and the mad exhilaration of combat
howard is dead solomon kane king kull
conan the barbarian who set a crown upon
his black head and defied all this world and
the next to deprive him of it three real
literary achievements three who will live
now that he is gone and the hand writes no
more    revive conan never never
never no the sagas are finished there
was a hint of finality about howards last
conan story red nails a knitting-up of
loose strands a rounding-off as if he some-
how knew he was completing a task in
that story i thought conan found at last his
mate his long-sought-for companion to-
gether they left that evil place together but
only in our imaginations let them travel on
towards whatever lies ahead let each true
lover of the great barbarian dream his own
tales of battle love and brooding witch-
craft any other course savors of sacrilege
read and read again what has been written
but let no other man try and wield that pen
or gird on that sword bury them with him
he will sleep the quieter and lovecraft
let the men who knew and loved him as a
friend pen his obituary i who only knew
him through his matchless pen bid farewell
to an artist who knew how to play upon
mans sense of fear as kreisler plays upon
his violin those long brooding almost
somnolent opening paragraphs of his almost
devoid of conversation-somehow love-
crafts pen seemed to falter when he attempt-
ed to put his words into a personal mouth-
impersonality was his keynote with a sense
of nightmare barely glimpsed the readers
eye fled from paragraph to paragraph al-
most chased or driven until the grotesque
climax was attained the spell broken the
pursuit lifted leaving him weakened yet

strangely exhilarated fear like fire is
cleansing whitehead eadie howard
lovecraft each in his own field such an
undisputed master that the loss seems un-
bearable each of course has his disciples
robert bloch for instance seems a fit pros-
elyte of lovecraft who with experience may
yet equal his master but no disciple can fill
the place of his teacher in the mind and
heart of any who knew that teachers genius
im afraid diis letter has spun itself out to
an immoderate length i can only plead my
faithful service of years as an excuse and
draw it to a conclusion  as to your
authors i have already spoken of robert
bloch his tales are real gems and should
get even better as he gains experience good
old seabury quinn almost the last of the
old brigade wrote a real winner the globe
of memories i believe it was called jack
williamson usually shows perfect taste but
his last was downright pitiable i never
thought to read such a hodgepodge of vile
villainy and putty make-up orrible plotting
and dastardly scheming in your magazine
that stuff does not belong in the aristocratic
weird tales repeat not the offense the
last pharaoh reads well is exceedingly and
fluently written and promises a fine climax
and who is this clifford ball his duar
the accursed was a neat piece of craftsman-
ship and should develop into a first-class
series

a first-rate job

  donald a wollheim of new york city
writes may i offer congratulations on
your august issue which is a first-rate job
lovecrafts yarn was one i had never read
before kuttners was a superb little fable
frank owen is a true master in his own
right the last pharaoh is thoroughly in-
triguing and worth while wellmans
necronomiconic is a honey but it wont end
necronomicon tales i for one want to see
the necro grow bigger and bigger it was
one of the factors contributing to the mak-
ing of wts vivid and unique personality

the terrible parchment

  joseph allen ryan of cambridge mary-
land writes wellmans short the ter-
rible parchrnent was especially interesting to
me for i believe i was on hand when the
idea for the tale was born otto binder
julius schwartz mort weisinger and i as
usual i was the small frog in the big
weird tales



pond were standing ac the corner of west
th street and broadway in new york city
last summer chewing the rag a bit before
departing on our various ways the con-
versation drifted to weird tales and to
h p lovecraft and the necronomicon in
particular mort glanced at the near-by news
stand and remarked suppose you went
over to that stand and asked for a copy of
the necronomicon and the fellow handed
it to you what would you do none of
us knew exactly what course he would fol-
low under the unusual circumstances otto
remarked pay for it i guess mort digest-
ed this for a moment or so then continued
that would make a good plot for a story-
for some fan magazine that is you could
explain that lovecrafts readers had thought
so much about the mythical necronomicon
that their combined thought-force material-
ized it as weisinger knows manly wade
wellman ouite well it may be that the idea
got around to the latter who developed it
into a short for wt how about it manly

cornish scenery

  i o evans writes from tadworth in
surrey as one of your many british read-
ers i have greatly enjoyed the stories that
appear in your excellent magazine and i
look forward to reading many more of them
i was however surprized to find a rather
startling error in a story which appeared in
a recent issue-i forget its name and that
of the author but it dealt with the worship
of an egyptian beast-god in a cornish mine
the story was the brood of bubastis by
robert bloch in our march issue-the
ed in this the author speaks of the cor-
nish countryside as a region of mystic moun-
tains and purple peaks that towered above
wild forest glens and green-grottoed swamp-
lands  dont think any description could
be less accurate the highest hill in the
duchy is brown willy of only  feet
there are no forests-the bulk of the country
is moorland and the only peaks are those
of the hills of spoil from the numerous
mine-workings which can hardly be said
to tower later your author mentions local
faith in leprechauns which are irish fairies
and kelpies which are scottish the joke
is that the scenery of cornwall has eery
qualities and the people faith in spirits
which would have suited your authors story
admirably had he got them right what he

weird tales of the sea

  arthur l widner jr writes from water-
bury vermont the july issue is one of
the best to date the cover is the most
realistic-iooking painting i have ever seen
clifford ball seems to have stepped into
robert e howards shoes but whether he
will fill them is another question so far he
has not done too bad but his feet will have
to grow some before he can equal the devil
in iron black cafiaan and other creepy
tales when i heard of lovecrafts death
it seemed as if i had been hit with some
weird tales



sort of strange paralysis i just couldnt
realize that i would read no more of his
faultless masterpieces or receive another let-
ter in his small unusual hand yes he even
found time to write to an ordinary person
like myself no one can ever take his place
stories as good as his may be written but no
one author can equal his string of a-l weird
tales the ocean ogre was easily the best
tale in the issue i always liked sea horrors
especially anyway graveyards vampires
and werewolves are fairly familiar in fact
they seem like old friends to me but the
sea with its slimy slithery beings from the
deep dark depths always frightens me inw
mans own element land most any fear can
be borne but the alien atmosphere of the
water has two strikes on you to start with
the hounds of tindalos runs a close sec-
ond and is the best story ive yet read by
long the angles and curves business was
something new to me and heightened the
interest quite a bit the whistling corpse
cops the yellow ribbon it is reminiscent of
marion crawfords upper berth the liv-
ing fog put in an eery touch

a satisfied english reader

  c r forster of bardon mill northum-
berland writes it is almost exactly a year
sincc i discovered my first weird tales in
an english book shop i am a science-
fiction fan and it was with some doubt and
with unpleasant memories of various hor-
ror and terror magazines that i started into
it but i liked that issue and subsequent
ones so well that i started to get the maga-
zine regularly from your english agent wt
is now my favorite magazine and i wouldnt
miss an issue for anything i was lucky
enough to get hold of a few scattered back
numbers for the years - although
they contained many excellent stories i be-
lieve that the magazine of today is an im-
provement over them both in contents and
appearance this in itself was a pleasant
surprize for my experience with science-
fiction magazines has been pretty much the
opposite my favorite authors are or were

h	p lovecraft clark ashton smith c l
moore robert e howard and seabury
quinn these five stood on a pinnacle above
the resr and the loss of lovecraft and
howard is indeed a blow to fantasy-lovers
i hope you will reprint many of their best
stories of lovecraft in particular i could

even better on the cover than on inside work

mrs brundage to surpass her previous ef-
forts good though they were from the

one well-satisfied reader may weird tales
and yourself always prosper

a few remarks

  c	l leighton of chicago writes al-
though ive read through every issue for the
last  or  years this is my first letter
though i sent a coupon with remarks of en-
thusiastic admiration when you printed the
solitary hunters i still consider this your
very finest over all the years the eyrie is
always interesting probably like other
weird readers i find myself looking each
month for miss hemkens contribution the
varying and conflicting tastes of your read-
ers including my own are amusing mr
hoyer will likely laugh at my considering
return to earth best for june but i liked
the careless casual style in which usru criti-
cized our backward planet still doping out
idiotic wars like him i found the last
pharaoh getting better but mr kelley copies
from doyles brigadier gerard  in every
issue i find at least one story worth clipping
out and saving so i have accumulated quite
a stock over the years among the best are
northwests trip to jupiter and his encoun-
ter with the beauty filled with evil smoke
yet i cant get a kick out of jirel of joiry-
how mr moore will hook up nd century
smith and middle ages jirel is something i
rather look forward to of course ive pre-
served every conan story-everything by the
great master howard noting mr sivtas
letter i wonder if duar the accursed might
sometime succeed conan in our hearts he
ought to drop thar irish accent though
you will note i like to cover the past in my
preferences-i find so much repetition re-
garding the last issue rather tiring mrs
shover makes just criticism of hackneyed
horror words-one reason i admired the
solitary hunters written in careless up-to-
date slang

concise comments

  richard h jamison of valley park mis-
souri writes with the two huge gaps so
recently made in die ranks of weirds

authors it would be fine if a few of the old
favorites could be coaxed into writing some
more tales how about writing some more
like the space-eaters mr long and
what of the two wandreis h warner
munn mary e counselman etc arent
they writing weird tales any more

  ian c knox of iondon england writes
congratulations on getting a substitute for
howard i refer of course to clifford ball

i	only hope he does not either get stereo-
typed or run short of ideas and dry up his
first two stories were excellent

  robert oberon of denmark maine
writes i had to write a line and tell you
how well i liked the mandarins ear that
swell story by frank owen in the august
issue let us hear from owen more often

  d	rouse of elkins park pennsylvania
writes i like the story duar the accursed
by clifford ball and would like some more
stories by the same author it is certainly
weird but good reading

  charles waldman of far rockaway new
york writes i have been reading your un-
usual magazine for several years now need-
less to say it has pleased me greatly the
magazine is ttuly unusual and out of the or-
dinary

  bruce bryan of washington d c
writes the statement of randolph carter
in the current wt is swell i mustve missed
it when it first appeared second i like the
mandarins ear and the abyss under the
world starts out well

  fred john walsen of denver writes
congratulations upon your success in keep-
ing the same high level for the weird
tales stories while the other publications
sink lower and lower it is a real treat to be
able to read some of the true poe type of
fiction and i trust that you will continue to
publish in die same high standard

  the phantom of the ether

the first warning of the stupendous cataclysm that be-
fell the earth in the fourth decade of the twentieth
century was recorded simultaneously in several parts
of america at twelve minutes past  oclock a m
during a lull in the nights aerial business several of
the larger stations of the w estern hemisphere began
picking up strange signals out of the ether they were
faint and ghostly as if coming from a vast distance
as far as anyone could learn the signals originated no-
where upon the earth it was as if some phantom were
whispering through the ether in the language of
another planet

a mysterious message from the ether i

 to all mankind

 i an the dictator of human destiny through control of the earths internal
 forces i am master of every existing thing i can blot out all life-destroy the
 globe itself it is my intention to abolish all present governments and make my-
 self emperor of the earth

 communicate this to the various governments of the earth

 as a preliminary to the establishment of my sole rule throughout the world
 the following demands must be complied with

 first all standing armies shall be disbanded and every implement of war-
 fare of whatsoever nature destroyed

 second all war vessels shall be assembled-those of the atlantic fleets mid-
 way between new york and gibraltar those of the pacific fleets midway between
 san francisco and honolulu-and sunk

 third one-half of all the monetary gold supply of the world shall be col-
 lected and turned over to my agents at places to be announced later

 fourth at noon on the third day after the foregoing demands have been
 complied with all existing governments shall resign and surrender iheir powers
 to my agents who will be on hand to receive them

 in my next communication i will fix the date for the fulfillment of these
 demands

 the alternative is the destruction of the globe

                                                kwo

thrills mystery excitement-the moon terror

  who was this mysterious kwo and was his
nessage actually a momentous declaration to the
human race or merely a hoax perpetrated by some
person with an over-vivid imagination

  newspapers and scientific journals began to spec-
ulate upon the matter advancing all manner of
theories to account for this strange summons in

europe as well as in america vast throngs of
excited people filled the streets in front of the
newspaper offices watching the bulletin boards for
further developments was this really the begin-
ning of the dissolution of our planet
