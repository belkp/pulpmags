if the cap or hat fits- but it didnt whereby there was much laughter
     dicky siarr and hynes get together this month and make merry

by richard starr

 william entered the picture-liouse rather
 hot and flustered he found emily
 just inside the swing doors leading to
 the balcony

   this was where she had said she would
 wait for him and there she was according to
 plan- william couldnt see her because he
 had just come from bright sunshine outside
 and he couid see nothing

   but he felt somebody catch hold of his
 arm rather roughly and emilys voice spid

    so here you are

   which meant obviously that emily was
 annoyed again she had been waiting a
 quarter of an hour and emily did not like
 waiting for william she said it was un-
 dignified for a girl to wait for a man though
 she would cheerfully wait two hours outside
 a shop when there was going to be a bargain
 sale but william of course was not a
 bargain sale

    im very sorry dear said william
 humbly and a little out of breath  funny
 thing i ran straight into the arms of old
 crabtree he was in my battery yon know
 and i hadnt seen him since we had that re-
 union two years ago i simply couldnt get
 away from him for a few minutes he would
 keep talking about a screamingly funny
 thing that happened once when we all went
 to the divisional baths at poperinghe you
 gee we hadnt had a bath for-

illustrated by hynes

    oh do be quiet  said emily crossly

  a torch girl projected an electric beam
of several kilowatts straight into williams
best eye and said 

   this way please

  the girl went ahead waving her torch
about in a most disconcerting way emily
followed william only kept in the cortege
by grasping emilys coat at the back and
emily did not like her coat grasped at the
back it annoyed her she said

   oh do leave me alone  and knocked
williams hand away quite sharply

  at the end of the front row of seats the
torchbearer deserted them

   come along- said emily  im not
going to sit here theres always a draught
this side and theres plenty of room farther
along follow me

  william followed her as best he could he
seemed to be always following emily she
was a born leader william could not see
her he could not see a thing except the
screen

	being the afternoon performance there
was a very small attendance and the front
row of the balcony was practically empty
so william did not have to walk over peoples
feet he followed emily by instinct and
presently when he bumped up against her
knees he knew that she had sat down
when she was annoyed emily was very
the girl who wasnt emily



sparing of words so lie did not expect her to
say anything

  william said

   oh here you are

  and sat down beside her

  william was never annoyed he hated
rows he was always ready to admit himself
in the wrong and take the first step towards
an armistice he was old-fashioned enough
to believe that there was nothing like a few
kisses to promote peace and forgiveness

   darling he whispered as soon as he was
in his seat  im sorry very sorry indeed
dont lets quarrel lets make up and be
pals

  he slid his arm round her waist and drew
her towards him he felt her stiffen but
overcame this reluctance by a little mascu-

from her own lap to his and held it prisoner
patting it reassuringly that was one thing
about emily she may have had her faults
but she had a very nice hand  a comforting
sort of hand to hold in a picture-house

   do you mind telling me what you think
you are doing  

  william stopped patting the hand though
he did not release it it was trying to get
away from him but william held on he had
that sort of feeling that comes to us sometimes
in dreams when the solid ground melts under
our feet leaving us trying to stand on less
than nothing he felt he must hold on to
something

  it was rather strange about this voice it
seemed to come from the next seat where
emily was sitting yet
it was not emilys voice
it was a girls voice and
a very nice voice indeed
but it did not belong to
emily it was
altogether a
weird effect
william turned
quite clam-
my there
must be a
ventriloquist
about playing
tricks a low
voice little
more than a
whisper with
a husky sweet-
ness that was
thrilling but
not emilys

 i beg your
pardon said
william cau-
tiously feeling
his way  i
didnt quite
get you

the voice
earne again not more than six
inches from his ear-on emilys
side

    once
fair and
square o n
the mouth

after which
william re
leased her
and sat
back feel-
ing that at
least he had done his
part

  he conveyed her hand

line strength there were times w iien wllham
believed in a mild version of the cave-man
tactics he believed that
if you kissed a girl well
enough and often enough
she would eventually for-
give you - though this
hadnt always
worked with
emily

  however
he kissed 
her three 
times in 
spite of her 
resistance i
once on the 
ear once on
the nose

 what have you got there
 asked emily  my hat said
 william automatically dont
 be ridiculous your hat is on
 your head 
e mlwsi magazine

   i said i should be glad if you would tell
me what you think you are doing

  william became more clammy gradually
a conviction was forcing itself upon him that
there was something wrong somewhere

   im afraid  dont understand he said
e who are you please  

   i dont know that that is any business of
yours said the voice rather sharply
william choked

  l b-but i thought you were emily
ci i am not emily said the voice  cant
you see that i am not  
c i cant see a thing confessed william
 i have just come in from outside and i
never can see anything in a picture house until
i have been inside at least five minutes

   well said the voice slightly mollified
 if emily is the girl who was with you-
that is if she was with you  

   she was-is

   well you were walking about three yards
behind her so  didnt know she went on
and you sat down beside me and then

   do you mean to say  asked william in
a hushed voice  that it was vou i kissed  
 it was

 well i cant understand it tve never
done a thing like this before and do you
mean that this is your hand im holding  
 it is and id be glad to have it back when
youve finished with it i know youve only

borrowed it but-

  william dropped the comforting little hand
as if it had bitten him he lowered his voice
to a whisper because he had just felt a foot
prod him m the small of the back-evidence
that there were people sitting behind him

  l im very sorry about this i mean i
hope you will believe that i did not do this
intentionally

   thats all right theres no harm done
jf you didnt know what you were doing-
that is whom you were doing it to but
do you when you take your young lady to
the movies grab her directly you get to your
seat a nd kiss her  

   this is the first time ive done it said
william  but you see emily and i had

been having a row we have a good many
rows and i dont like rows cant bear them
i was trying to smooth things over i thought
she was just in front of me instead of sitting
several yards ahead and when i felt somebody
sitting down i thought it was emily so
i sat down and kissed her

   you mean you kissed me

   im very sorry-

   dont worry worse things happen at
sea but didnt it strike you that though
you cant see a thing the people who have
been here some time can  

   it didnt strike me returned william
contritely  but now that you point it out
i realise that i have been a gorgeous idiot
i can only hope that you will forgive me

   theres nothing much to forgive as
kisses they are hardly worth mentioning
its rather a good job i didnt have a man
sitting on the other side of me

   that would have been very unfortunate
said william feelingly

   yes returned the voice drily  can you
see now  
t  am just beginning to make out your
outline i cant see your face yet

   then perhaps you had better go before
you do you might be frightfully dis-
appointed and i dont suppose emily will
be any better pleased for being kept waiting
again

  william felt that there was fundamental
truth in this re rose hurriedly and grabbed
his hat which he found he had been sitting
on not that it mattered being a soft felt
but he did not remember putting it on tho
seat

   i want to say again how sorry i am--

   please dont i know it was a mistake
and you havent hurt me get on and find
emily she must be somewhere at the end of
this row the longer you stay the worse it
will be

  it was worse than anything william could
have imagined williams explanation of his
second absence was received in frosty silence

  with a desire for peace he concealed the
active part of what had happened this did
not make his case any better because it
the girl who wasnt emily

s

transpired that emily gibbs had actually
seen

  she had been in the theatre a quarter
of an hour so her eyes were accustomed
to the gloom she had happened to
look back to see where william was
just at the very moment when william
had the strange girl well and truly in his
arms and was extremely busy kissing her

  williams delayed explanation of his

 did anybody
complain about
losing a hat  

w illiam

mishap when he eventually presented it for
consideration did not go at all well with
emily in fact she laughed a hard un-
pleasant sort of laugh

 is that the best story you can think of  
she said

 look here said william getting for
once a little annoyed himself  if i were

running two girls at th
same time do you think
i would be fool enough
to invite them both to the same picture
house at the same time 

  yes replied emily  you would be
fool enough for anything

to which of course there was no answer
william sat by her side for an hour and
the frost showed no signs of breaking the
picture did not help it was all about a man
who deceived girls in a barefaced way emily
applauded when in the last reel he was
overtaken by richly deserved retribution

  but not a word would she have to say to
the miserable william who was beginning
to wonder what he was really getting out
of being engaged to emily her lapses into
sweetness were becoming progressively rarer
whereas the girl he had kissed by mistake-
how delicious that low husky sweet voice
had sounded  how reasonable even generous
she had been over his fatuous blunder
already the idea was being born in williams
brain that he must see her again that is to
say he must see her for the first time because
he hadnt seen her at all yet he refused to
believe that her face could be anything but
delightful

  abruptly after an hour of stony silence
emily rose and went out william followed
meekly hat in hand when they arrived
in the lighted vestibule he went to put on his
hat and found he couldnt

   what have you got there   demanded
emily icily

   my hat said william automatically

   dont be ridiculous your hat is on your
head youve got a girls hat in your hands

  sad to relate this was only too true
williams hat was indeed on his head it had
been on his head all the time the hat in his
hands which he had been nursing for the last
hour was a soft felt but there its likeness
to his own ended it was as emily had truly
stated a girls hat

   where did you get it   demanded
emily

   it must be that girls hat returned the
stricken william

   what girl  

   the girl i-i sat down beside you see
i sat on a hat which i thought was my own
i was a bit confused when i left i took
the hat with me thinking it was my own

  they were now in the street emily looked
vengefully at the battered little toque

   throw the thing away she said

   how can i throw it away   returned
william spiritedly  it is not my property
i must go back and find the girl it belongs to

  to be honest william was not feeling so

 magazine

crestfallen as he looked to go back to the
girl with the husky sweet voice was the one
thing he most desired to speak to her
again  to see her face if he couldnt see her
this time he would wait until he could per-
haps to get her name and address

   do you expect me to wait for you while
you go back to that girl again   asked
emily

   no said william  but i am going
back nevertheless you would have me let
this young lady go home bare-headed  

   if you go back to that girl you can say
good-bye to me

  william bowed and said he was going
emily turned her back on him walked to the
kerb and hailed a bus which ignored her
william went back to the picture-house

  to avoid argument he bought another
ticket and went straight to the middle row
where lie had left the girl with the seductive
voice

  the girl was not there the whole of the
front row was empty she had gone without
her hat

   did anybody asked william of the
torch girl  complain about losing a hat  

  the torch girl giggled

   complain-i should just think so a
lady came and bullied me as if i had taken
it youve got it-oh my goodness she
said somebody had stolen it and she would
hold us responsible she carried on i can
tell you

   i took it by mistake said william
seriously  i thought it was my own

  the girl found this hugely diverting

   well you can leave it at the office if you
like then if she comes back we can give it
to her it doesnt look worth much now
she said we hadnt heard the end of this
yet 

   did she leave her address   askeci
william

   yes here it is

   good said william  the least i can
do is to call on her and return her property
with an apology

   brave man giggled the torch-girl  
wouldnt care to be you
the girl who wasnt emily



  william cared nothing for her
amusement he forgot emily

he felt like a surf-board rider
on the crest of the wave this
was his day he could do nothing
wrong he had her address

he was going to see her again

a hundred to one chance
had come home if he
hadnt picked up that hat
by mistake he would
never have heard of her
again now the ball was
at his feet every-
thing depended on
how he played it

  the name was
sarah gates as
a name for a girl
william had never
cared much for
sarah now there
seemed an aura of
distinction about it

  he took the
trouble to go home

the occasion called
for some pains over his appear-
ance he had a feeling that he
was going to meet his fate and
when a man goes to meet his
fate he puts hi best clothes 
if he has any sense william
did at any rate he had a
feeling that emily gibbs was
not for him for a long time
he had wondered whether
emilys almost habitual peevishness would be
likely to improve after marriage and what
married life would be if it did not

  in the early part of the evening william
neatly but not gaudily turned out rang the
bell of a house in his own suburb the door
was opened by a weary-looking maid

  william who was carrying a paper bag
asked if he could speak to miss sarah gates

   you mean mrs sarah gates  

  williams heart missed a beat he stared
at the girl

    no he said firmly  miss sarah gates

  well there isnt
a miss sarah gates-
not here at any

   did mrs gates
lose a hat at the
pictures to-day  
asked william a
trifle hoarsely

   oh -the girl
caught sight of the
paper bag-youre
the man who took
it  come in the
missis wants to see
you

 william was
shown into a small
front room gone
was his fine con-
fidence he was a
broken man the wave on
which he had been riding so
triumphantly had let him
down blind luck had led
him by the hand only to
make a fool of him he
had found the girl with the
beautiful voice only to be
told that she was a married
woman
the door opened a wo
man of fifty summers with
a hard nobbly face and a
martial way of putting her
feet down stood before
then you are him glaring at him as if
the girl i saw he were a malefactor
that day at the william stood up dumb
movies p 	he was like a man turned

   you didnt to stone he trembled to
see me-you only think that he had actually
kissed meput his arm round this
terrible woman and kissed
her imagination boggled at the idea it
could not be

   are you mrs sarah gates   he asked
faintly

   i am returned the uncompromising
female do i understand that it was
e ffcjssmsf magazine

you who took my hat this afternoon  
 entirely under a misapprehension said
william   thought it was my own

  stuff and nonsense a likely tale ive
 never heard of such a thing how could you
 mistake a womans hat for yours  

  i was rather confused explained wil-
 liam when i found i was sitting on a
 hat-

 do you mean to say you sat on my
hat  

 she grabbed the paper bag and tore out the
 unfortunate hat which in spite of williams
 efforts at renovation looked a somewhat
 rakish affair

     ruined   she cried  youve ruined it
 that was practically a new hat now look
 at it look at it i say that hat cost a

guinea-

  i shall be pleased to pay for it returned
 william

 he counted out two ten-shilling notes and
 a shilling on to the table the lady was
 slightly mollified but only slightly she was
 worse than emily-far worse yet in the
 darkness of the picture-house how reasonable
 and friendly she had sounded 

  i want to say again added william
 firmly  how sorry i am for what occurred
 this afternoon

  so am i-very sorry

  when i kissed you i had not the least

idea-

  kissed me 

 the terrible woman seemed to dilate her
 eyes blazed her nostrils quivered

    how dare you say you kissed me  

 a little ray of hope stole into williams
 heart like balm

  it was you i kissed wasnt it  

  i know what this is  declared mrs
 gates violently  this is blackmail thats
 what it is this is a deep-laid plan bccauso
 you think i am a lone and defenceless woman
 but i am not my husband shall hear this
 you shall tell your infamous story to him 

 she flung the door open and marched out
 with martial tread william hoped that
 mr gates was at the far end of the garden or
 in the bath he did not wait to find out it

 seemed to him at that moment that the story
 he had to tell was not a convincing one

  he slipped out of the room the narrow
hall was empty a moment later he closed
the front door behind him not till he was
round the corner did he breathe freely again

  a terrible business altogether but there
was one bright spot there was strong pre-
sumptive evidence that it was not mrs gates
he had kissed in the darkness of the balcony
that was some relief but the girl of the low
sweet voice-how was he to find her now 

  emily returned her engagement-ring and
three weeks later william heard that she was
going out with mr purkess a rather well-to-do
widower william hoped she would be happy
mr purkess had a very fine car and emily
had always seemed to regard it as a grievance
that william could not afford a car

  being honest with himself william could
not look upon it as a misfortune that he had
lost emily he found indeed that life was
brighter their temperaments had evidently
clashed perhaps she would get on better with
purkess he hoped so

  he did not forget the girl with the magnetic
voice whom lie had kissed in the dark it was
impossible to forget her but she faded to
the back of his mind where she remained as a
sweet rather sad memory it was impossible
to be really grief-stricken over the loss of a
girl he had never had and whose face e had
never seen and after all there was no
definite proof that it was not mrs gates
had kissed

  ho went back after a time to his old ways
that is to say he caught a later train to the
city in the morning ever since his engage-
ment to emily he had caught an earlier train
than necessary in order to go to the city with
her

  and once more he saw the girl whom ho
used to see nearly every morning on this train
the pretty girl with the dark brown eyes and
the glossy hair and the rather demure air of
always minding her own business it was
nearly a year since he had last seen her

  always william had been instinctively
drawn to this girl not merely her prettiness
there was something companionable about
the girl who wasnt emily

her she seemed the sort of girl a man would
feel comfortable with she would understand
him he would not have to be always ex-
plaining why he did this and why that- he
could not imagine her nagging

  there had never been any sign of recog-
nition between them though william had
seen her nearly every morning for about two
years he was not the sort of man to scrape
casual acquaintance with a girl nor was
this the girl to allow it william had seen
other fellows try it with her and draw a
complete blank

  imagine then the surprise of william when
she greeted him with a starry smile and a little
nod of the head

  william was puzzled and delighted every
morning after that she smiled and william
raised his hat then came the day when they
found themselves straphanging side by side

   well she said  how did you get on with
emily  

  william stared gradually enlightenment
came to him the girls eyes were full of
laughter her hair had the rich gloss of the
horse chestnut her lips were sweet and
fresh and inviting she was lovely

  all round them people devoured their
morning papers and other straphangers
bumped them unmindful that romance with
shining face had come suddenly among them
william drew a long deep breath

   you  he whispered just loud enough
for her to hear above the thunder of the train
you are the girl i saw that day at the
movies  

 you didnt see me-you only kissed me
c well i said i was sorry

  i know you did you said it several
 times

  it was untrue i am not sorry i only
 wish i had kissed you more

  hush  i ought not to listen to this  

  how is it that you know me   asked
 william

you were the only one of us who was
blind you know i could see your face quite
well and i recognised you

  did you know there was a hat on the seat
 next to yours that day  

  was there  it wasnt mine i didnt
 take mine ofi

  i sat on it

  gracious there was a woman sitting
 behind i suppose it was hers if people put
 their hats on seats they havent paid for and
 forget them serves them right if they get sat
 on how did you get on with emily  

  i should like to tell you about that said
 william  how would it be if we were to
 meet to-night and have a cup of tea some-
 where  

  oh i dont know about that you see
 we are perfect strangers we dont even
 know each others names

  that can easily be remedied and i dont
 see how you can look upon a man who has
 kissed you three times as a stranger

 well theres something in that i sup-
 pose she gave him a flashing smile  how
 would six oclock suit you outside the royal
 exchange  

   the end

her eyes

 t love amanda for her tresses
 so silken and so fair

 i love her for the way she dresses-
 so neat and debonnaire

 i love her for her dainty nose
 uptilted prim and chic

  love her for the pretty rose
 that blooms upon her cheek

 but since her  screw  was raised again
 a quite unlooked-for prize

 she seems annoyed when i maintain

 i love her for m me

thomas lived in
knightsbridge a
select enough quarter
for any cat a land flowing
with milk and honey but
more particularly with milk
especially around seven
oclock in the morning at
that golden hour when the
milkmen swarmed up like a
besieging army past the albert gate you
would be sure to find thomas hanging
round tail waving hopefully aloft it was
the only thrill that crossed ms humdrum life

  now some cats-town-bred cats mind you
-can put up stoically enough with the
enforced ennui of their colourless existence
thomas however could not may be lie
was too highly strung bored stiff with the
unrelieved monotony of it all the adventurous
spirit of some far-back wild ancestor asserted

itself and-well-

  the long autumn evening was drawing
to its close outside the roar of the knights-
bridge traffic died away and the hurrying
footsteps of passing pedestrians grew few
and far between in the luxurious soft-
lighted lounge of a big house facing hyde
park only the ticking of a clock and the
clicking of knitting-needles broke the silence

  curled up in the lap of a big arm-chair
lay thomas apparently asleep but he was
not asleep oh dear   just horribly bored
that was all he opened one amber eye and
blinked as his grey-haired mistress lay
aside her knitting rose and crossing to the
door went out

  a moment later thomas rose too and
stretched himself till his back vied with
the marble arch in the gracefulness of its
curve  then the pupils of his eyes like ver-

               tical slits set  yellow stone
               his attention was attracted to
               the open window

                 outside a passing bowler-hat
tilted rakishly upon its owners
head drifted by on a level
with the window-sill that
fair emblem of romance gave
thomas an idea it seemed
to beckon to urge him into the
great outdoors he silently let himself down
out of the chair

  a pause followed while the walnut clock
on the mantelpiece ticked hurriedly as
if anxious to get on and pass over an awkward
moment then thomas appeared on the
window-ledge edging himself with great
care past a large bowl of dahlias for thomas
be it understood never upset anything
it was i should think his one boast

  a minute later his broad striped head
poked itself out of the open window and
remained still while he blinked his sleepy
eyes and sniffed the cool evening air then
followed his large body and one noted that
he looked well-nourished but that was
just his trouble physically thomas was
well-fed but spiritually he was starved for
adventure

  opposite the park with its tall trees
and shadowy shrubbery seemed to beckon
him with irresistible charm just then
from among the lower branches of those
same trees thomas caught the baleful glare
of two pale luminous discs they seemed to
float in the very air without head or body
attached to them and the eyes-for thomas
supposed them to be eyes-held in them
an indescribable challenge from acros
the road thomas met their cold stare
he had never seen such mysterious eyes
one crowded hour

before they shone in the dusk
almost like his own

  just then they vanished as if
by magic and so did thomas
the mystery of those luminous
orbs was too much for any cat
with highly-strung nerves to
stand he just slipped quietly to
the ground and stepped mincingly
across the pavement to the road
beyond

  just as he was midway across
a solitary rider on horse-back
came cantering down upon him
thomas pulled up short half-
scared at this unexpected
apparition anyone watching
would have said that thomas
had better say what few prayers
if any he knew for the beast
which loomed up suddenly out
of the gloom looked as big as
the achilles statue beside him
in the nick of time how-
ever thomas fled from
under the clattering hoofs
and soon was safely on the
opposite pavement

 here more
trouble awaited
him for against
the railings was
a young cairn

thomas stared bad at the owl with that fixed stare of unspeakable
hate common to his kind
e	magazine

delicately investigating the possibilities of a
derelict bone at the approach of the cat
the dog lifted his head and snarled but
thomas was a london cat with all that that
implies and it took more than a scalliwag
cairn to shake his nerves

   wherefore he leapt lightly as thistledown
upon the dogs back and stuck there as
close as a burr scratching and spitting luridly

  the next few seconds were quite crowded
and the cairn had the time of his life even
a kitten you know can make wonderful
havoc of a dogs back when once it gets fixed
there and thomas was a tougher propo-
sition than any kitten when that dog at
last got his leave to go he went rather
sooner than at once proclaiming his sorrows
aloud to the world at large so that his
master coming cut at that moment from his
front-door heard him from afar off and swore

  as for thomas he turned about all savage
and bristling and went too he went
straight up to and through the railings
brought a filmy spiders web to sudden grief
and found himself at last on the soft warm
grass of hyde park

  as he went he turned and looked back
once at the lighted windows of the house he
had just left a few moments before in there
among the shaded exotic lights of the big
room thomas had been just an ordinary
domestic pus felis domesticus-a harmless
tabby now out here in the gathering dark
among the night he had become just-cat
the prowling hunting beast that his wild
forefathers had been

  silent as a ghost with head down and
shoulders humped trotting with the peculiar
swinging loose stride that he adopted when
in spacious surroundings he passed like a
patch of floating mist right down the avenue
of elms beside the row once he slouched up
to a couple on a scat beneath a tree but
finding that they took rather more interest
in themselves than in him he passed super-
ciliously on his nose in the air

   a little later a mouse shot out all hot and
bothered from a clump of bushes beside the
path it must have been an absent-minded
creature for it quite failed to see the cat

standing in its path and committed suicide
via thomas accordingly this was life in the
raw-bare and without frills on life such as
did not often come the way of a mere town
cat and it suited thomas esthetic senses to
a t

   for a minute or two he growled over it and
then pretending that he had forgotten its
very existence he turned his back for a
moment as a cat will when he turned again
lo the mouse was no longer there it had
vanished as completely as if it had never
been

  thomas was a sensible cat he was no
believer in spooks so he looked around the
mouse must be somewhere

  at that moment a voice close above him
said suddenly and awefully  whorc
you 

   startled thomas glanced up in the direction
of the voice and there before him seated on
the topmost bar of the railings was a bird
but no ordinary bird for he was a giant among
the feathered ones moreover-ah the secret
was out -this was the owner of those dread-
ful  eyes-in-the-night  which he had seen
from the window of the house across the road
what was more a mouse--thomas mouse-
hung limply from the owls clutching talons

  this was the limit thomas glared back at
the owl with that fixed stare of unspeakable
hate that lives in the eyes of all the cats when
roused and the owl returned the stare ad lib
and with compoimd interest possession he
seemed to say was nine points of the law and
the mouse was his mouse then without
waiting to bandy words about it he spread
his dusky wings and flitted up into a neigh-
bouring elm in a hollow of which where the
first branch jutted out from the massive
trunk he had his nest a safe retreat wherein
he was wont to sleep all day with the distant
roar of the knightsbridge traffic drumming
dimly in his ears there not being at the
moment over-hungry he laid the mouse in
his  larder and went off forthwith to seek
for further stores

  and thomas  ah but thomas interest
was roused and when that happened you
never knew-it might lead to anything
one crowded hour



looking after the fugitive he watched it dis-
appear amongthe foliage of the elm and in
less than two seconds thomas was well on his
way up that elm doing a little exploration
work on his own account

  presently he found the entrance to the owls
larder popped his head cautiously over the
edge and looked inside the place smelt like
a dustbin and small wonder there before
him were rats sparrows and starlings of
various ages and  the top of the heap was
-his own mouse

  thomas too looked upon possession as
nine points of the law therefore he carefully
retrieved his prize from the rubbish heap and
returned silent as the night itself by the way
he had come till once more he stood upon the
path beneath the tree then being minded
to carry his prize home with him to be de-
voured at leisure he gripped it in his teeth
and glanced round furtively with a low
rumbling growl as a warning to all his foes

  he reached the railings at last and was
about to slip beneath when he heard the angry
voice of  eyes-in-the-night  and the quick
snap of his beak and looking up saw the owl
flit silently past and away	 

  but thomas didnt care two of the owls
hoots for his troubles he had had one
crowded hour of glorious life he was content

  he slunk across the road like a shadow
leapt through the open window into the
lounge of the big house and there upon the
hearth enjoyed the fruits of his labours
then having cleaned himself up and com-
pleted his toilet he jumped into the big
arm-chair and settled upon the cushions

  a moment later the door opened

  the darlingsaid a silvery feminine
voice as his mistress entered the room with a
saucer of milk  i do believe youd never stir
your sleepy old bones uniess  made you 

  thomas rose lazily and made towards the
saucer

thomas was curled up luxuriously in an
arm-chair apparently asleep but he was
not asleep  just horribly bored


                 some things there are that cannot be bought but
                        chester found that he could get-

it was a dangerous place that shop of
geddings from the avenue it looked
like a reconstructed elizabethan house
rather tall to be sure but authentic enough
from the pavement at one time a canton
shawl would hold the centre of the shop-
window at another a chinchilla wrap or
a set of silken mysteries which seemed to draw
the ladies as apple-blossom draws the bees
thus attracted a certain percentage buzzed
inside and could only escape by leaving
behind them some of that golden honey
without which the hives of industry would
presently cease to exist

  a dangerous place yes a trap if you like
but a trap which wouldnt have been success-
ful without the gift of imagination and a
fine disregard for the perils of the deep
in far-off kyoto and yokohama in shantung
and along the shores of the pearl river in
calcutta and madras in lyons and on both
banks of the seine in brussels and the low
countries in such widely-flung islands as
luzon and madeira patient workers toiled
and spun so that geddings might be properly
baited with beauty so that no woman born
of man might enter without feeling her
heart beating faster and her pocket-book
opening a trap if you like or a world-wide
web and at the centre of the web sat old

john gedding in his office  themezzanine
floor looking at the card which his secretary
had just given him

   chester taylor he read whos he  
 i think you asked him to call she said
 didnt he write you something about
booklets and circular letters  

   oh yes said old john  send him in
he leaned back in his chair having long
ago got over the trick of looking busy when-
ever a caller was expectcd and there he
sat a fine old spider in the middle of the
web which had been his lifes spinning
he had once been red-headed but time
had partly cured that and he had no doubt
once been slender but time had changed
that too and there he sat with shoulders
so wide that a visitor seldom gave thought
to the curve of his front especially after
looking into those quizzical blue eyes under
their rusty lashes

  a young man entered so young indeed
that he had not yet outgrown his freckles
but he crossed the room with a grave and
earnest step as though his cargo were full
of the noblest merchandise

  mr taylor said old john motioning
him to the chair by the side of his desk
 what can i do for you  

  the caller sat down saying

   ill show you sir
and while he unbuckled his attache-case  red-headed and freckled like i was
the two men looked at each other across thought old john and probably thinks
the years between them	he has the world by the tail like i did

romance for rent

  the net results of his work were four
heavily corrected sheets of paper four
sheets which chester sourly
tore up after reading them
m

e	magazine

  the young man thought

   a tough old turkey but i think hes
a good one im glad i put on a clean shirt
this morning darn these locks anyway 

  he almost pulled the second one oft-a
touch of spirit by no means lost on the one
who was watching him-and then from
the open case before him the visitor drew
a two-page circular

   mr gedding he earnestly began c we
all seem to be born to do one thing well
youve done this he made a motion
indicating the encircling shop  you know
how good it is from the results you get from it
and ive done these he waved the circulars
 and i know how good they are from the
results we get from them i was working
in northampton at the time my first job
in the shoe department of grain and mitchell
and one rainy day i wrote this mr grain
liked it he had it printed in two pages of the
telephone-book the results were so good
that we printed it in most trade directories
and that month our business in the shoe
department more than tripled i have a
letter here from mr grain which says so
and then-and not till then-he handed
the circular to old john it was a simple
little folder entitled  a regular man
has an awful lot to thank a calf for
old j g glanced it over but gave close
attention to the accompanying letter

   a few weeks later continued the earnest
young man  mr grain called me to his
office  chester he said  ive been wonder-
ing if that circular of yours was a fluke
weve over-stocked ourselves with fishing-
tackle see if you can get out an advertise-
ment that will move it that night i wrote
him this one  a line a hook a sweet cool
brook inside a week we were ordering fresh
tackle and mr grain wrote me this letter
of appreciation and put me in charge of the
firms advertising

  again old j g glanced at the circular
and again he bent his rusty brows over
the letter which went with it

     worked there a year and was so success-
ful that i began to realise that this was
the one special thing which i had been

born to do well it was then that i beg-
to dream of coming to london i arrived
here six weeks ago to-day and here are
the results to date

  this time old j g sat back in hi chair
as he examined the further exhibits in the
case of young chester taylor v the hard-
boiled city of london

   youre doing well he grunted then

  ci yes sir said the other earnestly
and so are those who are doing business
with me and now mr gedding my terms
are simple i would like to write you an
advertisement if you dont like it when
you see it you owe me nothing if you
decide to use it and arent pleased with the
results you still owe me nothing but if
you use it and are pleased with what it does
for you i then receive fifteen pounds-and
an order for another ad

  since laying down the last exhibits mr
gedding had been studying his visitor more
attentively-and whether it wa the young
mans freckles or his hair or his earnestness
rich old john g seemed to see himself again
when he was a poor young john g and had
come to this same city with not much else
than an almost fanatical belief that some day
he would be driving his own horses up and
down piccadilly 

   have you had your lunch   he suddenly
asked

    not yet sir said chester his colour
rising

  they went to a near-by club-and by the
time they had reached dessert the young man
from northampton was telling his great
ambition yhen he had acquired sufficient
capital he meant to establish a business of
his own-a business that could be built
up by folders and advertising until it was
known throughout the world  like-like
geddings for instance he concluded

 raising my own child if you know what
 mean sir instead of raising other peoples
children

  the older man grinned--his thoughts
again traversing fifty years

   nothing like raising your own he
nodded c but go slow at first ive seen
romance for rent	

he watched her as she silently slipped a new
sheet of paper into her machine  no foolish-
ness about this one chester thought

many a promising young man go broke	expenses down he said  the address on

because of too much overhead expense	my letter-paper i dont mind telling you

  this time it was chesters turn to nod-	now is my boarding-house and all my

only he did it more earnestly	typewritings done at a public stenographers

   thats one of two things i vowed to	 thats the way to get along  exclaimed

mvself before i came to london-to keep	old john g looking back at the years when


ae magazine

fie had gone without his lunch in order to
inch ahead that much further  but you say
you vowed two things whats the other 

  this time it was a wonder that chesters
colour didnt set his ears on ire

   to keep away from the girls he said
dropping his voice but trying to look very
serious indeed  i noticed at school-and
after i left school-that a fellow who chased
 girl was never much good for anything
else they seem to take all a mans thoughts
--all his spare time when he ought to be
improving himself-all the money that he
ought to be saving and i may be wrong
but i cant see what they give for what they
get it seems like a one-sided game to me

   thats the way to talk  chuckled old
john g rising  all right son lets get
back to the office im going to have you write
me an advertisement-on the terms you said
our silk stocking departments been falling
back lately lets see if you can give it a
boost

  they walked back to the store together-
the earnest young man and the still beaming
old one by his side

   of course you know they wear silk
stockings said the latter once

   oh yes said chester  in fact-er-
i believe  know all the essential facts about
them

   thats good   said old john g heartily
k thats fine  because in our business you
ksow we must understand the ladies or we
wouldnt be able to please them

  arrived at the store he led chester to a
tall blonde whose manner was that of a
gracious young duchess who was doing this
thing for a lark

   miss dacher he said  this is sir
taylor who is going to do some work for us
will you please show him our line of silk
gtockmgs and-er-give him any other
assistance he requires

n

r dozen times chester started his advertise-
ment for gedding s-and as many
times he crumpled the paper and threw
it across the room

  no good-no good lie groaned to him
self and finally in something like despair
 whats the matter with me to-dav f 

  for inspiration he turned to the successful
circulars which he had written in the past
and there he presently made a discovery
all his hulls-eves had been scored on appeals
to men shoes fishing-tackle gloves a
safety razor a service station shirts income-
tax accounts wireless-these had been his best
subjects

  and although he hadnt told this to mr
gedding since coming to london he had done
badly-once on a millinery announcement
and the second time on a folder which he had
written for a hair-dressing firm

  he tried again-this time with a title
 a woman has an awful lot to thank a
silk-worm for	

   toh  he muttered tearing it up
thats taken from my first title good
lord have i come to the end of my rope
already  

  again he tried silk satin muslin
rags silk stockings nightingales and
roses  imagine the world without
them and  madam why do you wear
silk stockings  

   ah thats it he told himself frowning
at this last question  it  knew that i
could write something that would pull em
into the shop but do they wear em to draw
attention to their legs  or because they tee
smooth or because ol the colours they can
get  or because theyre the fashion  or-or
because they look rich ri darn it  he added
almost growing indignant  why should a
woman want to wear silk stockings any more
than a man wants to wear silk socks  thats
what i can t see

  it occurred to him vaguely that miss
dacher might be able to tell him-that tall
blonde who had taken such cool interest
in showing him the long tops and the re-
inforced band lor attaching the suspenders
suspenders there again was something
but instinctively he shied trom miss dacher
she was entirely too decorative-too-too
obviously clever

  chester tried another title  it makes no
romance for rent



difference why you wear them and
although at long last he achieved two hundred
words the result was vague-the reflection
in truth of his own vague thoughts upon the
subject

   oh well he told himself with an
earnest young frown  i cant spend the
rest of my life on this mr gedding may
like it and if he doesnt ill try again
thats all

  he put on his hat and went to the office
of the public stenographers who did his type-
writing it was a busy office with a row of
cubicles along one side-staccato retreats
which from the noise might have been
incubators for young riveting hammers
-miss kenvon generally did his work  and her
door being open he looked in she gave him
a business-like nod and he took the chair by
her desk

   another circular he said  id better
wait while you copy it some of the changes
and corrections have been pretty well messed
around

  he watched her as she silently slipped a
new sheet of paper into her machine-an
intent young girl and almost as serious as
himself she read the first paragraph without
a change of expression and then her finger-
tips started dancing over the keys

   no foolishness about this one thought
chester  i-i wonder if she knows anything
about dress-the kind of thing one gets at
geddings for instance  

  her outfit he thought looked smart enough
the jumper was silk- or do they call them
blouses   he uncertainly asked himself-
of a quiet design something like tapestry
he wasnt sure whether her skirt was blue
silk or serge but there was no doubt about
her stockings one of her feet was curved
around the leg of her chair showing a shapely
shoe of black kid and a smoke-coloured silk
stocking

   she doesnt think much of it he told
himself watching her face for the next few
lines  when she wrote the circular about
the radio sets she kept smiling and nodding
but shes only frowning at this i wonder
if i asked her  miss kenyon i wish youd

tell me something why do girls wear silk
stockings   but no  youve got to know a
girl before you can ask her questions like
that

  which obviously pointed to danger-to one
of the two things which he had vowed to
avoid when he came to london

   unless it could be done on a business
basis he frowned to himself  i think
ive read somewhere that they have agencies
in london where you can engage a girl for
the evening-girls who talk well and dress
well-and everything on a strictly business
basis now a girl like that might help at
times-on a circular like this for instance

  the girl at the desk he thought was
frowning more then ever at the copy in front
of her

   you dont like it   he suddenly asked

   it doesnt seem as interesting as your
last one she said  at least it doesnt
to me

   well never mind dont go on with it
he told her coming to a quick decision  it
needs more work perhaps you can tell me
something do you know any agency in
london where  could engage a girl for the
evening   he told her the type of girl he
wanted  everything to be absolutely
business he concluded   only i want a girl
whos bright and knows how to talk

  they looked at each other and for the first
time chester noticed the length of her eye-
lashes and the cleft in her chin

   well- she hesitated  im ncffc

exactly silent and sometimes at home they
say i talk too much but i wouldnt mind
working overtime like that-on an absolutely
business basis asyou say

   what terms would you suggest   he
asked his serious young look never more
earnest

   well-- she hesitated again  all
this is new to me but an average evening
would be about-about three hours so
suppose we say six-and-eiglitpence an hour-
or a pound for the evening

  upon reflection he accepted the legal rate
and they also agreed upon that evening for
their first meeting


e mbst wagazm

   for ive got to get that circular done-
and done right chester told himself as he
reached the street and looked at the hurrying
hungry city around him  because if i ever
lose my confidence in this mob i might as
well pack my trunk and go back home

iii

they met in the lobby of the hotel
astoria by the side of the goldfish-
pond

   hallo said a gentle little voice in
chesters ear

  he arose-just a bit awkwardly if the truth
be told-and at first he could hardly believe it

   i wouldnt have known you he said
shaking hands as he had seen the other men
do but not having heard them he had to
speak on his own  this-this is a great
pleasure he said  this-this is de-
lightful

  and indeed she was giving him value for
his money she was dressed in an evening-
frock of apple-green watered silk-one of
those tight bodices with a flaring skirt
her stockings and shoes were silver and
over her shoulder was a japanese shawl in
which cherry-blossoms fell from a tree

   i hope you havent been waiting long
and arent too hungry she smiled

   oh yes he said gratefully receiving
the hint  er- have you any particular
place where you would like to sit  

  she told him about the rochambeau roof
where there was a good show and an even
better dinner so they started for the
rochambeau and when they reached the
street she said  how lucky  heres a taxi
waiting at that chester felt a premonition
of disaster but the taxi fare was only a
shill mg and a man cant mourn long for
that

   my brothers seen the show here said
miss kenyon  he says its awfully good
but you have to tip the waiter half-a-crown
if you want a good seat

  again chester felt a vague chill of warning 
but when in exchange for his half-crown
they were led to a table marked  reserved 
-a table from which they had an unob-

structed view of the stage the orchestra and
the dancing floor-and when the waiter
brought a menu and instead of beginning
 olives s d celery s d  it was headed
 special de luxe dinner s per plate
no convert charge again the young man
from northampton inwardly rejoiced as one
who has been delivered from grave danger

  the show was just beginning-dancing
girls and prancing girls-a girl with a book
who tunefully pretended to be taking chesters
telephone number a girl with a violin and a
contralto voice a comic juggler who finally
threw up his red rose and caught it in his
pants pocket a trick mule which made love
to a party of middle-aged women and finally
climbed up on their table and sent one old
lady into hysterics for reasons perhaps best
known to herself and the mule

   miss kenyon said chester leaning over
the table  what is the general feminine
attitude toward life to-day  

   how do you mean  v she asked

   well as you know im doing that
circular for geddings i hope to do other
work there and i think it would help me if
i knew the general feminine attitude toward
life

  as you can probably see this was vaguely
leading to the more specific question   why
do girls wear silk stockings   but when
chester came to the end of his remarks he
found he was as far from the stockmgs a
ever

   im not sure yet that i understand  said
she  but if i know what you mean by
 feminine attitude i can tell you mine in
three words anything but love 

   anything but love lie repeated staring
at her

   yes she said  i dont know whether
im modern or not but if thats being modern
i am love   she scoffed  its a trap-
a biological trap schermerhorn calls it its
baited with moonlight and flowers and
spring and other miscellaneous idiocies of a
sentimental nature and if a girl is lool
enough to tall for the bait shes a prisoner
the rest of her life playdon though doesnt
call it a trap he calls it a fever you catch
romance for rent	

the mule made love to a party of middle-aged women and sent one
into hysterics for reasons perhaps best known to herself and the mule
e mjqsst magazine

it like you catch any other illness only
when youre delirious with scarlet fever or
typhoid they watch you and take care of
you they dont let you sign an agreement
giving away your life-your freedom but
when you have the love fever thats just
what you do and when you get better-
where are you  

   in the soup said chester fervently
 miss kenyon im awfully pleased ive met
you of course i havent considered the
question so much from the girls point of
view but youve no idea how love plays the
dickens with a man-a man i mean who
wants to get on in the world it throttles
him strangles him takes his time takes his
money ties him hand and foot not for me 
and it isnt as if the girls were worth it
they arent with a few unimportant little
differences theyre all the same-millions and
millions of them like-like germ in a test-
tube and why any sane man should de-
liberately pick out one of these germs and-
and inoculate himself with it and-and go
crazy-well thats one of the mysteries of
life that ive never been able to solve

   no said the germ across the table-
rather shortly if the truth be told  neither
you nor anyone else i can understand of
course that once upon a time there was
nothing else for a girl to do but now there
are so many opportunities for women look
at miss gluck for instance she owns the
place where i work she has a chain of type-
writing offices all through the business dis-
trict and makes four thousand a year-oh
easily  and look at miss tvser with her tea-
rooms  and mrs masters only shes a widow
with her shops for women  and miss condon
with her sweet shops and mrs shotton a
widowagainf he best- known interior decorator
in london and thats another reason  told
you anything but love as soon as i have
a little more money saved fm going to start
in business for myselt i m nor going to spend
my life darning socks and peeling potatoes
for a man who would probabiy be a darned
sight better off t he had never met me 

  the excitement of the argument had brought
new colour to her cheeks an added bright-

ness to her eyes and it didnt occur to
chester til later that this would have been
a good time for him to have said  miss
kenyon i wish youd tell me something
why do girls wear silk stockings   instead
he was thinking  i couldnt have picked a
better girl either for looks or sense

  the show had come to an end and the
orchestra was playing a ox trot called  an
old-fashioned sleigh ride for me the
floor was darkened and snowflakes seemed to
be flying through the air

   do you dance   miss kenyon asked
as impersonally as she might have asked
 do you like milk  

   a little said chester  but im not good
at it

   neither am i she told him  but its
good exercise and after sitting in an office all
day- -

   shall we try it   he asked seeing that
she paused

  fortunately the orchestra wasnt playing
too fast and after all you dont have to
do much else but walk in a fox-trot

   i thought you said you werent good at
it said miss kenyon presently looking up
at him

  which didnt exactly make chester hate
her

   now what shall we do   he asked
after they had returned to their table for
dessert  shall we go to a show  or shall
we stay here for an hour or so and talk and-
and exercise  

   have you tickets for a show   she
asked

   not yet 

   then i think wed better stay here he
said marvelling at his inexperience  the
orchestras good and  ve been sitting in the
office so much lately

  as a matter of fac thev stayed till ten
oclock and before thev ieft chester had
mastered a fancy little jig step at the corners
-a fancy little jig step which seemed to add
considerably to the beneficial effects ol the
exercise

   now if you like she said as they ieft
the building you can put me in a taxi
romance for rent



 and then youll be free for the rest of the
 evening

  no said chester  im going to take
 you home and besides he naively added
  ive nothing else to do for the rest of the
 evening

 so they got in a taxi she in her little corner
 and he in his and on their way breaking a
 rather awkward silence he said 

  i wish youd tell me something

  yes   she murmured encouragingly
 enough

  you know im writing that folder for
 geddings even then he couldnt quite get
 the question out so he compromised  is
 there-is there any difference in silk stock-
 ings   he asked

    ill say theres a difference  she ex-
 claimed t a silk worm would be surprised
 at some of the things which pass for silk
 stockings skimpy sleazy things-youd
 wonder they hold together as long as they
 do why theres a shop-

 for the next ten blocks she told him some
 of the tricks which her shopping experience
 had taught her and had hardly finished when
 the taxi stopped at a good-looking block of
 flats in the south-west

    t well night-night she said  please
 dont get out

     just a moment said chester

    from his inside pocket he drew an envelope
 which had obviously been prepared and
 placed there in advance

     whats this   she asked

     your fee he told her

     my fee  

     ytour pound

    she almost ran across the sidewalk with
 it and paying off the taxi as well chester
 walked thoughtfully down-town to his board-
 ing-house

      a silk worm would be surprised 
 he muttered once  theres my title all
 right 

iv

 old john gedding seemed to like the title
 too sitting at his desk on the mezza-

  not so bad he said after he had read
 the copy and with a shrewd bristling of his
 rusty brows  i suppose miss dacher helped

 you  

  no said chester  er-another young
 lady

  ah   said old john  so soon  

  oh this was strictly business chester
 hurriedly told him  a young lady-a
 young lady i hired for the evening

 he felt himself perspiring a little

  nothing like playing for safety solemnly
 agreed the older man  all right well
 print a thousand of these and see what
 happens personally i hope you get your
 fifteen pounds and now if youd like to

 try another circular on the same terms-

  yes sir said chester in his best earnest
 manner

  weve just received a shipment of french
 needlework-little intimate things you know
 that women wear

 again chester felt himself perspiring

  im afraid sir he said  that-that im
 hardly specialised enough in a line like that
  but couldnt you study it-the same as
 you did this other subject  

  i-im afraid not sir not a line like
 that

 old john said something which sounded like
  sssrrrumph   and loudly blew his nose

  well lets see he continued considering
  have you any-have you any objections
 to millinery  

 chester also considered as you may
 temember he had tried one millinery folder
 with unfortunate results but perhaps

 with the help of miss kenyon-

  no sir he said  ive no objection to
 millinery

  all right third floor ask for miss
 mooney and ill phone her youre coming
 tell her you want to see the new paris model
 that just came in and write about that

 the new model was simplicity itself-
 hardly more than an old-fashioned tam-o
 shanter without flare or button

  i wonder if youd mind if i borrowed

my young american press-agent friend
lit a cigar and challenged me to argue
through his horn-rimmed glasses

 all this punk he said  about movie
stars fightin their way up sure gets my goat
it aint work as does it nossir its fellows
ike myself publicity-see  

  oh surely not in every ease    demurred
 timidly

 yessir ever darned one 

 but what about the really talented
artists  look at mamie vanlotta for
nstance

 yeah  disgustedly  just look at
her guess you wont find no moths parking
thereabouts kiddo s 

 you mean--

 suah if it hadnt been for one of the
cutest publicity stunts ever put over lil mamie
vanlotta wouldnt never have got nowhere

   you dont say so  were yon her agent  
  he shook his head sadly

   nope oughter have been wa a bit
sweet on lil ol mamie an-but dyou meantei
say you aint never heard about it  

   nope i mean no  i always thought-

   waa youve got another think cornin
sonny im just gonna spill such a bibful oi
disillusionment over you that youll think
youve been out in the wet for a week

   in the first place mamie aint no italian
counts disinherited daughter like what she
makes out all the italian she can say is
 macaroni an she didnt have to go to
naples to learn that neither

   nossir vanlottas downright small towr
texas all the way through

   mamie always had a hunch that shed be
famous one day readinmovie papers and what
not by the time she was twenty tame waa

fbe one tiling mamie wanted nothing else but

   she therefore slid clown the lil ol
drnin-pipe and let out for noo york the
size of that burg sorta knocked her dizzy
for a day or two but after a breather she went
round all the big theatre and idnema guvs
asking them to give her a chance they all
pointed at the doorway to fame an told her
to shut it quietly as she went out

   mamie wasnt goin to be pushed off the
map like that though

   she got started at a third-rate eating
joint dingin hash
an clam chowder-an
macaroni this she 
felt sure was how you
started climbin the
ladder of fame

   most of em are
like that at first they
dont realise that there
aint enough time in
one life to climb that
ladder

 nossir there aint

   you gotta fly up
else the roof gardenll
sure be all crowded
out before you arrive

   anyway ol mamie
cut oft her hair an
most of her skirt and
generally made herself
a good proposition to
look at then she
waited for bites which
there wasnt any

 i met her and got
rather musty just then

she said shed marry
me if id full ol some
publicity to get her into
the movies

   waal anyway after
a whole winters work
mamie counted up what
cash shed saved and
asked herself whether
it was worth all the
bother 

  havin replied in the negative that it
wasnt she decided to spend it all on a last
fling at the movies never told me a word
about it neither though i found out after-
wards when she landed me with the frozen
mitt an  good-bye for ever 

   pier big idea was to get some really snappy
photos took and send them to the big guns
personally

   didnt do it half neither
c nossir ill tell the world she didnt i
 ten dollars each they cost her besides a
bad cold through sittinon
a high studio stool with
little  but a piece
of ribbon here and there

 she kinda reckoned
that when the hollywood
crowd saw her figure
etc theyd be after
her like a mosquito
after a tenderfoot in
the tropics noo
york had taught
her that much
anyway

   waa she went
out to the studio to
collect her photos one
dark night an as it
was well outa the real
biz of the city and she
had a hundred dollars in
her bag mamie was just
a bit scared

 everything went all
right though an the
photos sure pleased her
down to the ground
the young feller what
gave em to her was so
taken up with them that
she had to ask him twice
to hand em over when
he tried to get fresh
mamie just shoved the
hundred dollars at hirw
an walked out as
though he was an
unpleasant small

sitting on a high stool with little on but
a piece of ribbon here and there


e	magazim

  poor lil mamie was hurryin clown the
 street like anything when all of a sudden two
 men came rushin out of a house just beside
 her

  they stopped on the side-walk an faced
 one another

  next thing mamie knew was a couple of
 hangs an the two guys lyin shot almost at
 her feet

  she nearly threw a faint to make it a
 trio only the big idea hit her first

  there was nobody in sight yet revolver
 shots aint so imcommon as all that in noo
 york

  out came her waitresss pencil an two
 of the photos

     on one she scribbled   your mamie and
 on the other  your little sweetie

  then she dropped em careless-like
 around the tragedy and ran for it along a
 dark avenue before the first cop arrived

    next mornin they traced her an all the

 kinema an theatre nabobs was fightin like
 wild cats round her door mamie vanlotta
 was made

 he threw away his cigar and sighed wearily

 but how-

  oh you poor boob  cant you get it 
 why every mornin paper in noo york had
 ferreted her out and was breakin its neck
 to give her millions of dollars worth of free
 publicity big head-line stuff

fatal duel

 two strings to her bow 

  that sort of punk

  they all printed copies of the very daring
 photos found beside the duel

  why goshdarn my sisters socks it was
 the smartest bit of publicity ever put over
 anywhere

thought about the dodge

when the tall thin man in the grey
suit sitting reading in the opposite
seat made his third expressive arunt
i lowered my paper and raised my eyes

   i see you are reading john tappletons
 flames of desire  i ventured  how
do you like it  

  the book descended a little revealing a
sharp hatchet lace wearing large horn rims
and surmounted by a thick greying head of
hair brushed back from the foreheid the
man looked intently at me tor a moment

   have vou read it   he asked at length
in a deep grating voice

  f i have i answered readily

  he thrust his head forward fairly boring
me with his deep set eyes

   and how do you like it  he queried
sharply

  i laughed a little nervously at his abrupt
manner

   oh  i think its not at all bad-in fact
its jolly good i said

  he gazed at me long and intensely his
lips set in a thin hard tine then be eaned
forward and prodded at my knee with a
bony forefinger
 you do do you  you think that he
growled  well let me tell you young man
that i think your taste in literature and hction
is atrocious and about on a par with john
tappletons ideas ol writing it for sheer
unmitigated balderdash john tappletons
 flame of desire to use a vulgarism takes
the cake the biscuit and the whole dashed
bakery 

  i gaped at him m astonishment

   of all the silly sloshy muck that has ever
been foisted on an innocent unsuspecting
and long-suffering public  flames of desire 
stands supreme it is absolute tripe-and

rotten tripe at that john tappletons
ability at writing is about equal to a british
heavy-weights at boxing  flames of
desire  bah  the man who wrote it
ought to be in the  flames of hades his
english would disgrace a schoolboy his
love episodes would bring tears to the eyes
of a snake his adventurous passages would
bore a brick wall grrrr  i tell you frankly
sir i havent words to express myself when
i think of john tappleton and his  flames of
desire it amounts almost to criminality
to sell such stuff and if there is a bigger
fool idiot and nincompoop alive to-day than
john tappleton it is his publisher and a
bookseller who can offer his work for sale
to a deluded set of mugs who are unfortu-
nate enough to buy it ought to be in gaol

  he got to his feet as the train pulled up
slipping the book into his pocket

   but-still-you evidently find the volume
good enough to keep i managed to blurt out

  he turned his head his fingers on the
door-handle and glared at me causing me to
shrink nervously into the corner

   and why am i keeping it   he snapped
 because having m a weak moment and
when i was mtoo big a hurry to make a careful
selection paid two good shillings for-this 
-he tapped his pocket with the tips oi his
distended fingers as if it contained something
horribly loathsome- which is not worth as
many halfpence i intend at least to jet some
value out ot it i shall take it home and
use it leaf by leaf to make spills with which
to light my pipe

  he got out and i followed him on to the
platform and stumbled towards the exit
feeling stunned and dazed my mind a chaotic
whirl of distracting emotions

the

films and
as seen by

of the month
and gmb

  in my young
  days said

  the pro-
ducer as he
waved the bath-
ing beauties into
line before the
camera  it wuz
the boys we used
ter call strip-
lings and then
the chief electri-
cian pulled the
old one about
mr sennetts
young ladies be-
ing like new
york city be-
cause they were
built with out
skirts so the
producer stunned
h i m with h i s
megaphone and
the great relent-
less cameras
started their
mighty song and

the beauty-canning factory went on ever on
with its work

  such is life in the great west-such is a
slice of the said life cut from the tenderest
portion of hollywood and served up hot
to the thunderous ravening printing presses
that eat the intellects of strong men and fling
the mangled results to a palpitating public
exclusive music rights reserved it was
after seeing  the president featuring the
inimitable and unpronounceable mr mos-
iukine that we sort of came over all virile

ivan mosjukine  the president

and impassioned
-as above we
took mel with
us and he was
quite swep
away too-so
much so that he
afterwards hailed
a taxi in war-
dour street with
a gesture that
had in it nil the
magnificence of
benito mussolini
opening a paper-
hangers exhibi-
tion with the
first slap

  so y o u w i 
readily under-
stand that  the
president  is a
strong rousing
piece of work-
and not a tarne-
c a t drawing-
room drama

as a matter of
fact in our humble opinion it is the very
best thing that the good ivan has done yet
certainly there is none of the glitter and
magnificence of  the prince of adventurers 
and  michael sfrrogoff the two successes
that made his film name

  in place of this there is an unexpected
almost fantastic streak of humour running
through it that links up the more dramatic
sequences and thereby throws them into
sharp relief and it is in this humour that
ivan shows himself to be an actor-with a big
the merry-go-round



 ay almost any other star would have lost
the onlookers sympathy as a serious character
in the later parts of the show by reason of
the almost slap stick comedy at the beginning
the story traces the rise of a lazv care-free
south american tramp to the proud position
of president of his special little republic
it is a story of amus-
ing improbabilities
that ivan by his queer
genius has made con-
vincing and real it is
the story of mighty
crowds of election
fevers of frenzied
oratory-and inevit-
ably of love chico
torro the  tattered
wanderer loves the
countess valdez from
afar and of course
in the end he marries
her well as has
been said ivan holds
the whole thing to-
gether and absurdity
fades like frost before
the sunshine of his
talent the thing
goes and if you
take our advice
youll go too and
see the film when it
comes your way
which will be some
time this month

  mr mosjukine by
the way was born-
you guessed dead
right - in russia
at penza  to
be exact he took
up law first of all
but a magistrate got
a ricked tonsil in trying
to call him by his
surname so ivan went
on the fillums so
weve heard anyway

by stages he wended

mabel poulton

his way to hollywood and were sorry about
the pun his first film was  surrender and
now he has signed a contract with the great ufa
company to make pictures in germany whats
more we wish him luck for twould be a far
far better thing ior the screen if there were
more people like ivan the magnificent to cast
their shadows before
the world

  	 

it was in  that
the alhambra theatre
london suffered a
great loss a little
fair-haired blue-eyed
typist had been work-
ing there happily
enough until the big
griffith film  broken
blossoms was
booked and a stage
prologue arranged
someone was wanted
to double for
lillian gish in the
show and the little
typist was chosen for
the job but and here
the plot thickens
george pearson was
there and george
pearson stared at the
stage and emitted the
word gosh now
when you get a cmema
magnate looking at a
beautiful girl and
emitting guttural
noses you can bet
your uttermost
farthing that pretty
soon fair fingers
will be guiding a pen
along the dotted line
and pretty eyes will
b e surrounded b y
bright green grease-
paint and directed
full at an expensive
lens and thereafter


e

the cinema magnate will smile benignly and
offer his bank-manager a cigar

  which is how it all happened the little
typist was offered a part in the pearson
film  nothing ever matters featuring
betty balfour then she was roped into
 the glad eye and subsequently starred
as  tessa  in margaret kennedys uncannily
beautiful  constant nymph so
the alhambra lost the prettiest
typist it had ever had and the
british film industry gained a
beautiful actress whereat the
bfi above-mentioned waved its
hands palm upwards and lustily
lisped three cheers for george
pearson esq

  you see the typist was mabel
poulton

  in the words of omar
khayyam-or was it
winston - shes
the fondest girl were
of apart from her
quaint beauty she has
a whimsical sweetness
of expression that sets
her far removed from
the wax-doll stiffness
of many a famous
hollywood beauty

in the constant
nymph  this was so
apparent that she
made the film charac-
ter of  tessa  every
bit as much an
artistic achievement
as edna bests inter-
pretation of the part
on the stage there
was a haunting sweet-
ness a rare beauty
and a highly imagina-
tive quality about her performance that
one does not often find in these days of
inegaphone-made talent and now she is set
to play the part of a fluffy flighty  vamp
well well-in justice it must be said that
parts like  tessa  dont happen along every

day of the week and films have just got
to be made else what will pay for the
directors cavaire and coronas  the film too
in which mabel vamps her sprightly way is
excellent of its type-but oh dear

  our exquisite  tessa  in a hilarious
jumping-cracker comedy the child of a
tyrolese mountain day-dream brought down
to earth as a comedienne  so
much for the poetic corner of
our mind which we now re-
move place on the floor and
jump upon with both feet
all the same its a funny thing
 but weve laughed ourselves
if almost as much in love with
s mabel the  vamp  of
 virginias husband as with
the adored  tessa -which
is both a tribute to
mabel and the film
itself you see she
just cant help being
the sweetest thing that
ever happened i n
whatever part she
plays

     virginias hus-
band  was adapted
from mrs kilpat-
ricks highly success-
ful stageplay it
concerns a young
and beautiful man-
hater who has to
pretend to be mar-
ried in order to keep
the allowance made
her  certain condi-
tions by her aunt-
amusingly played by
marie ault and
naturally enough uproarious
comedy follows finishing with
virginia and her temporary
husband deciding to make a
reality of their pretence all
of which is brought about by
the machinations of the
pretty little  vamp

  new york the giant of american cities
has probably suffered more from growing
pains than any of the other lusty children of
the federation-growing pains brought on
by gunmen police  graft and a shifting
population comprising every undesirable alien
trom chinee to croat

  oid timers indeed can remember the days
when the th police precinct-the district
west ol fiith avenue and below th street-
was mostly composed of dancing and gambling
halls so notorious that it is difficult in these
more ordered times to believe they existed
as they did that was until captain alexan-

der williams took
charge of  tho

th to get busy
and clean things
up and ho know
that in doing eo i-g
veritably took ids
life in his hands

   well captciie
said one of tbs
department having
visions of furtive
gunmen shooting
from dark door-
ways- well sir
t guess yoivvo gol
one very nice berth
in this job

    thats so re-
turned williams
with a grin  i
sure have the ten-
derloin and the
colloquialism that
he used formed the
christening oi that
special district of
new york for
 tenderloin it
thereafter became
and  tenderloin 
it is to-day

  so now youll
know just what its
all about when you
go along to see
doiores costellos
crook-drama of
that name which
is in generai release this month

  the film centres round the undercurrent
of warring gangsters that incessantly flows
beneath the effervescence and sparkle oi
 tenderiom s  cabarets and night ciubs
dolores the lovely as rose shannon ol kellys
cafe gets one oi the finest emotional parts
she has had yet she is in love with an
apparently honest youth who is really
one of a gang oi the choicest piug-ughes
who ever yegged a sate
e meewf magazine

  through her love for the boy she gets
involved with the gang herself whereupon
the cops gather round and talk to poor plucky
little rose the dancer in such a mariner that
you want to jump up and  set about  the lot

   this as a matter of fact is the keynote of
the whole thing-reality the crook stuff
the backstage business in the cabaret and the
 third degree  inquisition by the police are
so well done as to make even the most blase
of audiences sit up and take notice and as
for dolores-what adjectives can one gather
together to do her justice  sweet lovely
appealing graceful  take all the nice ones
you know and arrange them as you will 

   the task of putting the charm of dolores
on paper is beyond us anyway all of
which is not surprising when one looks at
her family history she is the daughter of
maurice costello who was one of the first
and handsomest stars way back in the old
days when charlie chaplin was an unknown
extra she was born in  at pittsburgh
and her golden hair and glorious blue eyes
soon got her into pictures amongst which

   old sanfrancisco  and  glorious betsy 
were her best

 c brass knuckles  is a good show if a
trifle sentimental but whatever its merits
or faults it is worthy of honourable mention
because of its hero and heroine monty
blue and betty bronson are two of the most
interesting folk in filmland each with a
record of having done some of the best work
that the screen has ever seen

  monty you will remember wa the young
doctor in sinclair lewiss brilliant  main
street and betty achieved immortality as
 peter pan each of course has played
in many other pictures although betty was
rather lost sight of for a while because it was
decided that she had  it and she was cast
in rather daring parts which she refused to
perform whereupon we are told she in-
curred the wrath of high moviedom which
hit back by leaving betty severely alone

  however the public wouldnt do as nice
obedient publics should and forget all about
her when told to and they rose upon their

hind legs and squealed for her return so
high moviedom had to masticate a generous
chunk of humble pie and send betty a studio
call-which is a fine tribute to betty and the
public at the same time

  in  brass knuckles  betty has a part
with which she does wonders all things con-
sidered it is another crook show about
reforming gaol-birds and paternal love and
mighty fists and monty and betty carry the
whole thing along with their usual con-
summate skill indeed it is a show worth
seeing but we are still waiting for somebody
to write a scenario that will give these two a
chance to show the real depths of unusual and
imaginative talent that they possess

but a little story of may and december for all that



 by stephen procter

there was nothing peculiar after all in
simon percivals refusal at the age of
forty-three to look upon himself as
middle-aged that sinister milestone is like
the house in alice-through-the-looking-glass
-the nearer you get to it the further away
it seems and anyway whether because he
had remained single or because he had always
been able to do himself rather well or because
his sister winifred herself unmarried made

illustrated by e hubbard

such an excellent housekeeper the years had
dealt lightly enough with him and his heart
could still respond to the annual call of
spring

  there were times indeed when lie felt that
comfort the menu and his forty winks were
the only things that made life worth living
but there were also times when moonlight
meant more than a martini when his skin
rejoiced at the tingle of march winds and his


e mm magazine

eye lit lip at the sight of a pretty girl a
dangerous age it will be granted especially
eince there were still times when pretty girls
looked at him very much as they had done in
the days gone by 

  to-night for instance dining with the
mamwaringa he had found himself next to
pretty little rhoda mansell who was staying
with his hostess he scarcely knew her
again she had shot up in a day from a school-
girl to a young woman and it seemed that
her taste in men had improved as well

  that young spark archie mainwaring
sitting on her other side had been left alto-
gether out in the cold for all his sheeps eyes 
evidently rhoda liked intelligent conversa-
tion with a man of sense and ripe experience
better than the babblings of a callow boy

   tell me he said  -you seem to know
everything 

   well-hardly  he laughed realising he
was being buttered but enjoying it the more
for the bitter sneer that curled young archies
lips

   its so interesting to meet a real man-of-
the-world sometimes   she murmured as she
rose at the end of the meal

  afterwards somehow he found himself sit-
ting by her side once more on the drawing-
room couch looking over an album of holiday
snapshots some of the snaps were rather
small requiring close scrutiny the scent of
her hair was like the subtle odours of awaken-
ing spring

  suddenly something inside him burst into
flame a touch of her little finger against
lis own a quick side-long and upward glance
of her big brown eyes-and all at once her
hair golden as sunlit corn her soft sweet
eyes her flowing slender shape became for
him the most intoxicating thing on earth 

  he did not think he had it in him the
years dropped away like melting snow the
blood coursed through his veins like sparkling
champagne he squeezed the girls hand at
parting as he had not squeezed for fifteen
years rhoda mansell child though she was
had taken his heart by storm and it was an
uncommonly pleasant sensation 

  there was something a little maternal in

his sisters smile as she watched him the
smile of the eternal woman indulging the
eternal boy winnie was a good sort they
could not have lived together all these years
if she had been the critical interfering type
of sister

   you seemed in good spirits to-night
simon  she observed  the way home

   frisky as a two-year-old   he laughed
joyously

  t then youre glad you came after all  
it had taken some persuasion to draw him
from the warm fireside of home with its
comfortable arm-chair so exactly moulded to
his shape its smokers table and the new
novel from mudies

   rather  was the boyish reply as he
tapped a cigarette to hide the dancing of his
eyes

   ehodas improved in looks observed
winifred  from what i remember of her
at school of course she was only in the
kindergarten when i left

   really   said simon lighting his cigar-
ette  by the way ive promised to take
her to the point-to-point to-morrow-the
minnel hunt yknow shes never seen one
care to come along  

  winifred shook her head

   not in my line im afraid she laughed

 and anyway ive some people coming to
tea shall you be back for dinner  

   oh yes he said hastily  yes back
for dinner 

   then youd better bring rhoda with
you i should like a chat with her about the
old school

  she was a topping sister was winifred
no one like her for tact since she had
come to look after him years ago all had been
peace and joy-the cooking sublime every-
thing about the house always tip-top a
fine woman too decorative in her wav with
a flair for dress which always made him proud
to be seen about with her and brainy by
jove when a man wanted a bit of sound
advice or a good stimulating talk about the
things that matter

   thanks old girl i will   h saidj
heartily
a peck of march dust



  the morrow turned out to be just such
a clear crisp day as the minnel hunt could
have desired with a fresh wind blowing and
a cold sun glittering above a man could
do without his afternoon nap on a day like
this especially when one had a date with
a girl like rhoda he had not been so
excited about anything for ages

  the years had dropped from him in the
most wonderful way since last night he was
amazed at the thrill that ran through him
as he stopped his two-seater outside the
mainwarings gate gave a couple of hoots on
his horn and saw the girl herself waving from
the window

  young archie preceded her down the steps
held open the gate and attempted to help
her into the car but she had eyes only for
simon it was obvious that there had been
no mistake about the rapprochement of yester-
day  the melody was to continue from where
it had left off

   what a lovely little car  she exclaimed
at once pausing to admire before jumping in
 is she fast  

   ive never got more than sixty out of
her confessed the proud owner

   goodness i should hope not she
gasped

   rats  growled archie t youve done
more than that on my pillion without turning
a hair  

  but nobody seemed to hear him

   jump in   said simon

  so she nestled at his side this radiant
vision in brown furs and the most fascinating
of scarlet hats and off they went

  simon had been a little nervous as to his
powers of entertaining so bright and youthful
a companion when it came to the point
but it was easy as pie the girl was a veri-
table inspiration without effort on his
part the prettiest little gossamer compliments
and shafts of badinage bubbled from his
lips

  he had never been much of a hand at this
light nd airv trifling but now his tongue
was miraculously loosed some of the things
he found himself saying were so good that he
made a mental note of them so that they

could be repeated for winifreds-but no
that was one of the many habits he would
have to get out of 

  it was a pity for winifred would have seen
the point so quickly and responsively whereas
he was a little bit doubtful whether rhoda
always did in spite of her charming smiles and
flashing teeth

  yet she had a humour of her own too-a
sparkling overflow of spirits that raised a
laugh out of the sheer irreflective joy of living
and carried him back-oh years 

  he had felt a little sinking of the heart
when he realised that young archie main-
waring had followed on his motor-bicycle
with another young fellow on his pillion but
he need not have worried the more archie
edged alongside and strove to catch her eve
the more engrossed rhoda seemed in the
company of her escort

   come  she said on one occasion when
the voices of the two young men had grown
inconveniently loud and near  well get
a better view over there i think

  and she had deliberately laid her thrilling
little hand on simons arm and drawn him out
of earshot

  simon swelled with pleasure it was the
most delicious compliment he had received
for years and all the more so because secretly
he rather admired young main waring the
young blade was just the type that he himself
had been some twenty years ago-tall slim
fresh-complexioned clean-jawed with that
romantic something in his dark eyes which
most girls would have fallen for at once no
mean rival for a man of somewhat mature r
youth

  but he could cope with him all right

   i say  he suggested after an hour or so
 if youve had enough of this what about a
spin in the car before the light fails  

   i should love it  she said at once

  and archie just advancing under cover
of an open cigarette-case was eliminated
once and for all

   thank you so much   murmured rhoda
at the end of the day as simon bade her fare-
well at the mainwarings door  i have enjoyed
it all


e fjsfjt magaiin 

  and the look in her big brown eyes was
so devastating that simon nearly ran down a
policeman on his way home and was all
but arrested for being drunk in charge oi
a car

     

  he found coffee awaiting him on his return
home-a second infusion which a man could
sip in comfort with his pipe in his mouth his
slipper less feet on the fender-
seat his tired limbs stretched
inelegantly yet deliciously
in the low arm-chair it was
just like winifred to think
of it-so soothing and
thoughtful

  nor did she worry him with
talk she just sat quietly
reading as she sewed ready
to listen or be silent as he felt
inclined infinitely peaceful

  he dropped a word at last

   jove  he said  im
tired  

  a wife would have taken
the opportunity to point a
moral warned him against
rheumatics or at the least
would have suggested a hot-
water bottle in bed not so
winifred

   poor boy  she said

 was he very bored  

   motors are more in my
line than horses he
confessed

   never mind it was all
in a good cause  hope
rhoda was duly grateful 

  what a good-natured fellow
you are said her placid eyes a lamb led to
the slaughter just to amuse the children

    think i gave her a pretty good time
taking it all roundhe said  she seemed
to enjoy it

   i wish i had your energy she exclaimed

  decidedly simon was being spoiled just
now

		a		

he awoke in the morning eager for another

day and much tickled to recall that his sleep
had been broken by dreams of fair ladies
it was years since he had dreamed of anything
more romantic than a sudden appreciation of
his pre-war russian bonds and it was
years since he had sprung out of bed with so
little effort

  the fact was he thought he knew where he
could meet her that morning  by accident

she had dropped a hint that she might be
shopping in the high street

   gad  but im potty on that girl  he
whispered exultantly to himself as he
shaved

  strolling past the shop windows bright with
easter novelties he knocked up against-
not rhoda but archie mainwaring also
strolling

   hallo mainwaring  he said
a peck of march dust



  good morning  grunted the young man
 suspiciously  youre up early arent you-
 for you  

 but simon was not to be ruffled

  nice day isnt it   he smiled

  rotten   almost snarled the other
 cursing under his breath as he strove in vain
 to light a cigarette  beastly wind-all
 this paper blowing about and dust

exclaimed both simultaneously starting towards
      her with uplifted hats

  a peck of march dust is worth a kings
 ransom you know 

  and dust in the eyes is a blind mans
 prize retorted archie sarcastically

 the two men stood facing one another
 awkwardly each yearning for the others
 absence yet disliking the appearance of turn-
 ing tail and suddenly the problem was

 solved for them by the emergence of rhoda
 mansell from a revolving shop door

  s ha  exclaimed both simultaneously
starting towards her with uplifted hats

   what an exquisite vision she was lovelier
than ever in the morning light with her
wide brown eyes the glint of the sunshine
in her hair the soft bloom of spring petals
on her cheeks at first she seemed startled
blushing a little as she
nodded to simon then
her eyes swept over archie

   hallo   she said  i
thought von had gone to the
office

  the young man suddenly
destitute of confidence
muttered something about
 having to see a man on
business

   dont let me detain
you  she begged

   allow me   interposed
the more experienced simon
relieving her of her parcels
 this is a bit of luck  how
about a cup of coffee in a
cafe somewhere before you
continue your labours  

   just what i was dying
for 

   coming along with us
mainwaring  said simon

  but the young fellow
excused himself glowering
and melted away-if the term
may be used of the some-
what hard and abrupt
manner in which he turned
and strode about his business

   poor bovmurmured
simon half to himself he
was young enough still to remember what if-
felt like to get the bird from a pretty girl 
but rhoda overheard him

   its his own fault  she said with a
little pout  he shouldnt be so con-
ceited  

   is he   asked simon  in what way  
  t n ever you mind she laughed sweetly
  hes not abad chap at heart i think
said simon who had always had a sneaking
fondness for the lad   wish i had his goli
handicap anyway  

  rhoda squeezed his arm as they entered
the caic

   lets talk about something more in-
teresting she suggested  have you been
to the hippodrome this week  

  hectic days

  but there was one fly in his amber for
once winifred jailed him he would have
preferred her to be a little more alert not
to say suspicious about it all a spice of
jealousy a hint of alarm would have added
piquancy to his  affaire it was rather
damping to find that she refused tacitly to
regard it as an  affaire  at all he might
have been an amiable uncie flirting with his
niece

  naturally this attitude ol winifreds was
a spur to any man ol spirit he would
show her that he had not yet passed the
dangerous age romance was by no means in
the sear and yellow m short there was a bit
of the reckless young devil about him still

  what a child she is   exclaimed winifred
on one occasion  i cant imagine what you
find to talk to her about  

   sweet nothings  suppose   grinned
simon mischievously but winifred only
laughed

  as a matter of fact the problem of keeping
the girl amused was one that had caused
him some anxious moments already alter
the effortless spate ot the first day or two
he had found it expedient to  swat up  a
little beforehand-epigram not too subtle
storyettes snips from the humorous week-
lies and so on she read nothing apparently
so it was perfectly sale

  and another thing winifred was showing
juf-it u little too much independence evi-
dently if simon was too busy to take her
about she would find someone who would 

	there whs one thing simon loathed it was
to come home and find the house empty

  one day his soul yearning tor more solid
meat than the hippodrome he got a couple

of stalls for winifred and himself for the
opera but his sister was dismayed when
he showed them to her

     i m so sorrv   she said her eyes full of
conrern  but ive promised to go to the
pictures with the mainwanngs archies
calling lor me at seven

   at seven   was his first thought what
about dinner  

   i thought you wouldnt mind having it
alone for once she said apologetically

   and just for the pictures   he exclaimed
outraged  do you mean youre going to
the movies-vow

   archie says-

   pah   he growled  you and vour
archie  the empty-headed young puppy 
it beats me 

  he looked at his sister suddenly suspicious
this was not the first time she had gone out
with young main waring now he came to
think winnie was a good ten years younger
than he simon but surely she would not be
so silly

   i cant think what on earth you have in
common with a hobble-de-hoy like that  
he said sulkily

   oh i dont know   she was murmuring
with a smile like the monna lisa il he s a
nice boy and he can be rather amusing at
times 

   ten minutes of him would bore me stiff  
growled simon disdainfully a short time
ago he had been sticking up tor archie but
this was a bit too thick

   well im sorry said winnie mildly
 but  cant very well get out ol it though
of course i should love to have heard lohen-
grin again why not ask rhoda to go with
you  

  simon snorted involuntarily

   tchk f  he snapped  shftd yawn her
head os  

  and a sudden spasm shaking him he
yawned himself at the mere thought of it
cavernously uncontrollably he was more
tired than he had thought this continual
racketing about after all he was not too
sorry that the visit to the opera was oil
the room looked very cosy there was a new
a peck of march dust



number of the  spectator  on the smokers
table the fire was warmer than the weather

   i dont think ill turn out again to-day
he decided  a quiet evening at homell do
me no harm telephone to the nadins or
somebody winnie and see if they would care
to use the tickets

   im awfully sorry   she said troubled
 to tell the truth he confessed  i
believe im not 

  and picking a fine corona from the cedar
box at his side he pierced it with a sigh
opened his  spectator  and threw himself
back in the long low chair an editorial on
 the degeneration of our public schools 
engrossed his attention for a while but the
soothing balm of peace and comfort hung
heavy on his lids soon they drooped the
paper fell to his knee his tired eyes closed-
and at the same moment the telephone
from the further end of the room began to
ring

   its rhoda announced winifred from
the instrument holding out the receiver for
him to take  now isnt that fortunate-shes
at a loose end to-night and you wont be
alone after all 

   whats that   asked simon blinking up
at her with glazed eyes  what dsay  

  rhoda wants you on the phone
repeated winifred  i told ber about those
tickets 

   you what   exclaimed her brother
starting upright in his chair

   you were quite wrong-she says she
simply adores opera

 yes-the belle of new york and
 the merry widow i  he snarled  thats
what she means  

   i dont suppose shes ever heard of them
retorted winifred with an unwonted shade of
aperitv in her voice  you forget they were
long before her time  

   bah   said simon then suddenly he
checked himself aghast how had it come to
this that he and winnie were having  words 
-or nearly so  it was years since that had
happened

  i sorry   he mumbled rising and taking
the crackling receiver from his sisters hand

 hallo  yes speaking yesc lohengrin
grand opera yiknow delighted rather
of course i will 

  the girls clear fresh voice came over the
wires in reply like a song of birds on a spring
morning bringing with it the picture of her
eager little face the wide brown eyes and
dewy lips and the scent of her warm furs

   whats that   he called for the voice
was not yet satisfied  oh at the melodeon 
no i hadnt thought of it i say wont we be
rather late three did you say-three in the
morning  

   good heavens winnie i  he explained
turning to his sister covering the mouthpiece
of the telephone  what do you think  she
wants me to take her on to a dance at the
melodeon hall after the opera

   how lovely  was the unexpected
answer  its a special carnival night
archie was telling me you are in for a gay
time

  the receiver was crackling impatiently again
-he took it up rather dazedly

   oh fine   he said  be a sport -of
course i will right-o  bye-bye 

  hanging the receiver thoughtfully upon
its crutch he returned to the fireside drew on
his slippers neatly folded the  spectator
closed the lid of his cigar-box and flung his
half-smoked stump into the fire

   well he said  youll be oil soon if
i dont see you again before you go good-bye
and i hope you have a good time

   where are you going   asked winifred
startled with a rapid glance at the clock on
the mantelpiece

   im going upstairs to change he said
heavily t and have another shave i shall
need it before the nights out 

    

  the opera was not so bad after all rhoda
was quite interested in the toilettes in the
stalls and thrilled by the number and weird
shape of the instruments in the enlarged
orchestra the curly-headed young man
with the drums fascinated her for quite s
long time as for simon there was
charm about her fresh young beauty and
naivete
but they left at the end of the second act
and took a taxi to the melodeon hall

 what time shall i tell him to come
back   he asked as they drew up at their
destination

c oh say three oclock replied he girl
her undimmed eyes sparkling with excitement
 if there are any extras it wont hurt him
to wait a little

simon with the girls quick eyes upon

                         simon picked out
trotting a jew yards
arms  there
him twisted a groan rhoda excitedly
into a gallant little	same

laugh pulled himself to-
gether threw a spring into bis gait and fol-
lowed her up the steps to the lighted vestibule

  here while waiting for rhodas reappear-
ance from the cloak-room he suddenly
perceived a young man leaning against one of
the gilded pillars smoking a cigarette it was
archie mainwaring
a peck of march dust

jml



n is sisier jox sf

away in archies i ii h t

they are  laughed	

 seeing them at the  yoil here too  he
 ime	exclaimed quite amic-

                ably  i thought you
 had gone to the pictures 

  we did said the other drilycc and now
 were here

  whos c we  j

  miss percival and i of course  replied
 the boy

 his look challenged comment he did not

change his negligent attitude his dark eyes
were sullen but alert almost as though the
encounter had been deliberately provoked
everything about him from the parting in his
glossy hair to the sheen of his patent-leather
pumps was immaculate yet somehow he
looked primitive dangerous

  then suddenly simon coolly regarding him
with the half-amused curiosity of a mastiff for
the arched back and fjufeed-out tail of some
e	magazine

defiant kittensaw the expression in his eyes
change as they shot past him to a further
corner of the vestibule the glitter melted to a
softer light the hard lines crumpled up there
was one brief glimpse of a tortured mouth and
the boy turning on his heel vanished in the
crowd just as rhodas hand was laid on her
escorts arm

   that was archie   said simon  did
you see  

   oh yes  she laughed carelessly  i
knew hed be here

   the deuce you did  thought simon
as he led her to the ball-room was there
more in ail this than met the eye  with a
now clarity of vision he covertly studied his
partners face flushed surely with something
more than the mere excitement of the dance
as her gaze darted hither and thither amongst
the crowd

   ive lost him   she said at length was
he with anyone did you notice  

   he said he had brought winnie

   oh   she said

  the carnival was the great annual event
of the season and the ballroom was crowded
a locally famous jazz band provided mingled
voeai and instrumental music swaying and
jogging to the beat a triple stream of dancers
held the floor and to seek for anyone in par-
ticular was like looking for the proverbial
needle in a haystack but after a while
simon picked out his sister fox-trotting a
few yards away in archies arms

   there they go  laughed rhoda ex-
citedly seeing them at the same time

   lets stop a minute if you dont mind
suggested simon drawing his partner out of
the stream and watching his sister as she
circled once more into view

  she was a fine woman was winnie tall
slim exquisitely gowned her coppery hair
beautifully waved but undeniably she was
not looking her best to-night ordinarily
she looked years younger than her age
but now in the arms of that smooth-faced
boy even winnie looked a little tired and faded

  simons hand flew to his jowl stubbly for
all his care what about himself he thought
as he turned and glanced half-involuntarily

at the girl on his arm sosmooth and bright
and fresh careless corrosive merciless
youth  what could stand up against it after
all save answering youth 

  winnie and her partner were approaching
again

   rhoda he said suddenly  what about
an ice or a glass of claret-cup before we go
any further  

   i dont mind she agreed her eyes glued
to the whirling crowd  but be quick  

   ill get the others to join us  he said
quickly leaving rhoda in a little alcove
half-partitioned from the room  wait
here 

  archie looked distinctly surprised as he
sauntered up and stood hesitating at the
entrance to the alcove while winnie flew to
rhodas side

  hallo he said  whats the idea  
 were dying for an ice and im sure you
could do with one too explained simon
 so why not pause awhile and join forces 
itll save two of us fighting our way to the
buffet

   you mean one of us can fetch the lot  

   quite  said simon smiling as he sat
down next to rhoda  do you mind  

   not a bit  replied the boy also sitting
down and crossing ins legs  mines a straw-
berrv and dont forget the wafer  

	o

   i thought you wouldnt mind main war-
ing suggested simon mildly  you know
the ropes better than i do 

  the bov smiled doggedly and drew a
cigarette from his case obviously immovable

   dont bother him simon interposed
rhoda with mock alarm  archie would feel
so lost among all those grown-up men  
with a burning scowl the young man sprang
from his seat and vanished in the crowd
it was the golden moment for which simon
had been working

   i say winnie  he cried excitedly
grasping his sister by the arm  theres
johnson  you must come and speak to him
before he goes  quick  

  and with a swift apology to rhoda he
dragged his astonished sister from the alcove
 whoever is johnson   she gasped
a peck of march dust



  in the vestibule he turned to her and
explained

   it was only a ruse winnie he said
 get your things on quick as you can
were going home 

   but-

   oh i know its unpardonable leaving
them like this and  dare say theyll never
speak to us again but what does t matter
so long as they speak to each other  poor
kids cant you see  they re dead sick oi
throwing dust in each others eyes lets
give them this chance if they dont take it
thats then look out but they will 

   for a couple of seconds winnie stared at
her brother in mute astonishment it was
outrageous it was a miracle then re-
covering her breath she searched his smiling
eager face with narrowed eyes until she
understood then she too smiled

     see she said slowly  yes i believe
youre right its the best thing we can do

  with one swift glance over her shoulder
at the bright lights flashing silks and tire-
less fire-hies in the room beyond she pulled
her cloak around her shoulders and followed
her brother out into the street

   the very next day it seemed that retribu-
tion was to overtake them at hall-past
eleven in the morning miss mansell and mr
mam waring were announced

   now were for it  groaned simon
whimsically following his sister across the
haji

  rhoda looked remarkably pretty in her
new spring costume of apple-green and white

 the little chocolate-coloured hat went ex-
 ceedingly wel with hor peach-blossom com-
 plexion and ber eye were shining-not
 with anger but with such a radiance ol un-
 shadowed jov that simons back straightened
 at once and he was able to look his whilom
 adversary almost in the eye

 cheerio  murmured archie with a
bashful smile

 but rhoda pushed him eagerly aside

  oh my dears  she cried flying for-
 ward with left hand outstretched  look
 what archies given me  isnt it too sweet 
 he took the slender hand and held it
 coolly up that winifred and he might admire
 as it deserved the ruby and diamond ring on
 the third finger archie had been quick about
 it the young rascal but it was no more
 than he simon and winnie had expected
 and so-the best of luck

 by the way said rhoda suddenly
after the congratulations were over  we
owe you both an apology ior last night
dont we archie  

  yes murmured simon non-committaily
 as the young man nodded gravely
  we are really awfully sorry she went
 on

 we cant imagine how we came to do
such a thing chimed in her swam
 the fact is explained rhoda contritely
 we were so excited about all this that we

 ieit before the end-

  at five to three supplemented archie
 huskily

  and quite forgot to say good-bye

it was one of those mornings which seem
like a christmas present delivered too
late-clear sky sharp hoar-frost that the
temperature was too low to melt every puddle
glazed and a sun like a prize orange but
robert dacre was in no mood to appreciate
natures quaint imitations of glass and fruit
the fates had dealt him a couple of really
nasty ones ann peebleshire had turned him
down with a flop that was practically audible

  and why  because-ha ha -he wasnt
up to the peebleshire standard in appearance

   youre not really spruce ann had said
with the critical detachment which is the
prerogative of the very aged and the very
young  and you never will be

   i dont suppose i shall be really oak or
fir either robert had retorted  but that
neednt prevent the bells ringing forth a merry
wedding chime

   im sorry said ann  but you cant
expect anyone to marry a man with hair like
-well like yours all over the place  

   its a dashed sight better than being
bald said robert which was tactless
because his runner-up where ann was con-
cerned was peter thetford and if peter were
standing upright in five feet six of muddy
water you wouldnt have known him from an
ostrich-egg

  ann had made a few further remarks and
then robert had departed hed been angry
then twelve hours ago now after a night
devoted more to thinking than sleeping he was
depressed but no longer entirely hopeless he

had dressed early walked seven miles country-
wards breakfasted at a weird little eating-house
with a company of market-gardeners and
finally found himself as the clocks were striking
ten in the high street of polders end in pre-
war days a mere hamlet now an ultra-modern
suburb

   the elite hairdressing and manicure
establishment-proprietors eand k westlake
the sunlight caught the gilt of the lettering
on a swinging sign it reminded him of the
decision he had reached in the early morning
hours he would smarten himself up he
would struggle to reach the peebleshire
standard and having reached it once more
try his luck with ann

  he pushed open the door and found himself
in a room furnished with the usual barbers
chairs three in a row facing a trio of the
usual basins above were glass shelves fitted
with brilliantine lotions and shaving-soap
at the end were curtains separating a small
room from the rest of the shop through a
gap in the curtains he had a glimpse of a
manicurists table lamp and instruments

  from this room a girl emerged she looked
about twenty she also looked startled one
might even say scared she was dressed
trimly in black and her eyes reminded him of
a kittens-except that a kitten wouldnt have
had such long lashes

   good morning said robert absurdly
dithered  are you the bear-dresser and
harbour-that is to say the bar-dresser
and herber  in other words he made
hair apparent



 golly said robert and decided that the final

a violent effort  are you in charge here
anyway  

 the kitten-eyed girl said  yes

 ci my hair needs cutting continued robert
 regaining confidence

  yes of course

  you mean that youve noticed it   he
 was now anxious to overcome her obvious
 shyness

 she nodded

  directly you came in

  well what about it  

  if youll sit down- the girl indicated

 the middle chair

 robert sat down it was the type of chair
 which is only a shade less complicated than
 those used by dentists for several minutes
 she was busy with levers and pedals behind
 him

yllable oj his remark ought to have been  wog 

   short or long   she inquired at last

   oh medium said robert  something
between a pom and a wire-haired terrier if
you get me but youre going to put one of
those dust-sheet arrangements over me first
arent you  

   certainly but in the mirror opposte he
caught the blush which told him that shed
forgotten all about it

  she fetched the usual shroud-like garment
and swathed him in it the shop was plea-
santly warm her touch soothing his early
morning walk had made him drowsy imper-
ceptibly robert drifted into a doze and dozing
dreamed he dreamed that he had a fresh
argument with aim peebleshire and that she
finally lost her temper completely and bit his
ear bit it so fiercely that he awoke with a
strangled yelp of agony


z mw magazine

  i-im most frightfully sorry said the
 girl  but your head suddenly jerked forward
 and the scissors slipped

  no damage done   robert asked she
 was dabbing his ear with a handkerchief so
 that the glass didnt enlighten him

  not really much just a tiny chip off the
 edge itll stop bleeding directly

  good  im afraid i went all blur its
 the atmosphere what about the hair-cut  
  im getting on with it

  righto 

 he settled himself back in the chair again
 and closed his eyes-not to sleep the sting
 of his wounded ear made that impossible-
 but because he wanted to visualise aims face
 to recall exactly how shed looked when they
 parted incredible that even for an hour or so
 his memory of her should have faded he
 couldnt even remember what her eyes were
 like except that they werent kittenish

 his medjtations were brought to a sudden
 end by something warm splashing on the nape
 of his neck

  crikey shes chipped me somewhere
 else  he decided and then realised that the
 splash wasnt blood but that colourless fluid
 known as tears

  here i say   he protested turning

    s-s-sorry said the hair-cutter another
 splash landed  his sleeve

  whats wrong  

  everything look at yourself w
 robert looked-and gasped

  wow 

  what does it look like 

  it looks said robert trying to be
 generous  as though it had been nibbled by
 a rabbit in a hurry whod mislaid his false
 teeth

  exactly a rabbit she amended fiercely
 anxious not to spare herself  suffering from
 delirium tremens i ought to have told
 you that i didnt really know anything about
 hair-cutting if only teddy hadnt gone up
 to london

  whos teddy  

  my brother

  are you and he the  e and k west-
 lake

   yes im the  k -kathleen the real
beginning was when the solicitors wrote and
told us that our shares were practically waste-
paper and that there wouldnt be any
income worth talking about and they
were shares which father always insisted
would make our fortunes

   but why start a barbers shop  what
i mean is its such a dashed unusual line for
amateurs to take up

   it was teddys idea hes always doing
unusual things hes really an artist and
the artistic temperament is like that he
read in a trade magazine that five to twenty
pounds a week could be easily earned by any-
one after a months tuition and that the
same advertisers who taught you would
afterwards tit up a shop on the instalment

system so he took the course-

   but couldnt stay it  

   and i studied manicuring and--

  the opening of the shop-door interrupted
her a young man wearing spats faultlessly
creased trousers and a -pattern bowler
entered

   i want- he began in a languid voice

his eyes fell on robert

   colly  he breathed and fled

   the next syllable said robert ts would
undoubtedly have been wog about the
worst advertisement ever for your business
if that was polders ends brightest and
best-

   which it was said miss westlake
bitterly  only yesterday i heard him
telling someone outside that he meant to
come in and help to set the rotten little show
on its legs

   is there a rival establishment he can
patronise  

  not nearer than little wretford thats
why we decided to come here

 when will your brother be back  
tc i dont know of course i ought to
have told you so at first but i hated to
turn away a customer weve had so awfully
few

   naturally i mean--well anyway its
nothing to worry about a swipe or so
with a hair-brush a parting here a deft
hair apparenf



sraoothi ng-over
there and only
the expert eye
won id detect any-
thing abnormal

  youre wrong
said miss westlake
miserably 
wish i could
believe that you
werent she
handed him a pair
of brushes

  robert did his
best but the
result wasnt en-
couraging

   still with my
cap on he per-
sisted doggedly

   where is your
cap  

  they searched
the shop but
fruitlessly

 youre sure
you had a cap  
she asked at last

   i was afraid
youd ask that
said robert

 candidly im not sure mines the sort of
memory that never is

   you cant possibly go out into the high
street without one  

  it would be risky but isnt there a
rear exit  

   yes across the little yard behind and
out through a gate into the passage that the
dustman and coalmen use but it seems a
horrible way of getting rid of a customer

   my dear miss westlake what is good
enough for a polders end dustman is good
enough for me i propose to steal quietly
forth purchase a new hat at the nearest

hattery-

   cobsons at the corner of king georges
avenue is the nearest

   mention casually that im never going
to have my hair cut in little wretford again

and return to town
by the first tram
available for-for-
give me-expert
attention

 i wish you
hadnt to
things like
this said robert
earnestly just
happen and you
mustnt let it
worry you if id
any advice to
offer it would be
to shove a notice
in the window
closed to-day
except for mani-
curing by order
of the home
secretary people
will merely think
its the latest
manifestation of
dora is this my
homeward route
 straight
through

   thanks may
i have your
address  id like to let you know-er-what
happens

  she handed him a circular robert
thanked her again reached the further door
and paused

   by the way ive forgotten to-

   if said miss westlake fiercely  you
offer to pay me for what ive done i-i
shall have hysterics

   in that case said robert  i suppose
wed better limit ourselves to  thanks very
much  and  good-bvc 

  he opened the door and found himself
in an asphalted yard at the end a gate
led to a narrow pathway beyond that was
the railway embankment

   queer business life mused robert and
he passed briskly through  yesterday that girl
and i were complete strangers to-day-

robert leapt over the plunging figure


e mfibiqf magazine

  he sighed slid his hand into his overcoat
pocket discovered his cap there sighed again
put it on and allowed his thoughts to drift-
a bad practice in a thoroughfare les than a
yard wide a young man in a grey suit
suddenly appearing at the point where the
path bent sharply to the left collided with
him and then gripped him by the arm

   half-time   protested robert

  the young mans grip tightened

    your times more likely to be twelve
months whats the game my lad prowl-
ing around the backs of other peoples
houses  

  robert paused perhaps three seconds
before he answered one can do a good deal
of thinking in that time though the young
mans eyes now glowering menacingly at
him couldnt be described as kitten-like they
very definitely reminded him of the girl he
had just left so did his mouth the total
resemblance was in short strong enough for
robert to identify him as mr edward
westlake if edward argued robert in
those vital three seconds discovered the
hideous hash his sister had made of her
solitary customers head-thatch there would
almost certainly be big trouble and the
poor kid had had trouble enough already and
a bit over

   go and play hide-and-seek with someone
else he suggested  and dont ask silly
questions im in a hurry to get to the
station 

   its the other kind of station youll visit
this morning 

   tut-tut how grim going to let go or
arent you  

   im not

   dont blame me then said robert
gaily he jerked himself free ducked clutched
at edward westlakes legs brought him down
leapt over the plunging figure and ran

  as he sped round the angle towards king
georges avenue and the station a sudden
thought struck him he clapped bis hand
to his trouser-pocket it was empty all
his pockets were empty hed come out
without any money at all he couldnt have
paid for his hair-cut even if kitten-eyes bad

  allowed him and the railway company
werent likely to exhibit a similar generosity
when it came to taking a ticket back to town

   this said robert to himself  i my
lucky day my really lucky day  

  he made up his mind quickly as he
emerged again into the high street he turned
left instead of right and obliterated himself
in a shop doorway an instant later edward
dashed out paused long enough to make sure
that he wasnt in sight and then continued
the pursuit stationwards robert waited
until the enemy was well beyond range and
then returned by the normal entrance to the
elite hairdressing establishment

  kathleen emerged from the inner room

   im sorry sbe began  but sir west-
lake is out and- oh 

   yes hes out all right said robert
 a whole lot out thats really what ive
come back to explain he met me in coal-
heavers alley just now and instantly decided
that i was committing a felony however
ive left him- 

   but wheres teddy now  

   somewhere between the wesleyan chapel
and the taxi-rank i imagine he assumed that
id bolted for the station because i mentioned
before we parted that i was in a hurry to
catch a train and hurled himself in that
direction missing me en route

   its all frightfully confusing

   but not robert assured her  so con-
fusing as it was the fundamental trouble
at present is that i came away from my digs
without any money silly thing to do
but anns as much to blame as anyone

   whos ann  

  c ann  oh just a girl anyhow ive
come back to make a suggestion

   what is it  

  robert explained

   goodness knows what edward will say
she sighed

   itll be quite a lot robert assured her
 you know what the artistic temperament
is so fluent so fresh thats why id rather
you werent here

    	  

edward westlake reached the station
hair apparent



made reasonably
sure that robert
wasnt there and
without wasting
further time re-
turned to the
shop he had
scared the fellow
if he hadnt
caught him he
walked straight
in began
say kathleen

-- and broke

off at the sight of
a swathed figure
in the middle
seat

   are you the
jolly old barber  
demanded the
figure  because
if you are i want
a hair-cut

  edward stared
at him incre-
dulously fluency
for once at any
rate seemed to
have deserted
him

   youre won-
dering robert
continued  how
my hair came to
grow like this

answer adjudged
correct-it didnt

i invented a patent automatic electric
clipper and the darn thing ran amok 

   are you trying to make me believe youre
not the burgling blighter i grabbed half an
hour ago  

   my dear young man i dont know whether
you always welcome your customers as
cordially as this but if so  can understand
why there isn t a queue outside a ll i wanted
was a hair-trim if you can manage that--
 i can but im hanged if i will

   in that case  shall walk out of the shop

  without my hat
and let the elite
of polders end
draw their own
conclusions

    go to blazes
wheres my
sister  

   how should
i know are you
going to trim my
hair or arent
you  

    itd give me
a heap more satis-
faction to give
you in charge
however con-
cluded the tem-
pera mental
edward who
after a rapid in-
vestigation had
d i s c o v e r ed no
v i s i ble evidence
of burglary or
other crime  i
ivill trim your
confounded hair
if only because
its the last hair

i	shall ever trim
he took up the
scissors nd
comb  listen
to me you moth-
eaten experiment-
alist when i
went up to town by the eight-forty-nine this
morning i was broke busted done in assets
-several final notices and an outsize in over-
drafts the solicitors letter didnt drop a
hint hes the old-iashioned secretive sort
when i came back by the ten twenty-three
and incidentally ran into you or some un-
fortunate facsimile it was with the cheering
knowledge that the shares the pater had
left had still got a kick in them in other
words had jumped to fifteen bob apiece
because the experts have found any amount of

ziasav

it looks as though it
has been nibbled by a rabbit
in a hurry
	e

tin that nobor guessed was there and
weve twenty thousand of those shares be-
tween us

   splendid 

   im not asking for your confounded con-
gratulations  im simply telling you because
youre the nearest approximation to a human
being that happens to be handy now forget
it and keep still and edward who in
the course of his concentrated course of hair-
dressing really had learnt a thing or two
proceeded to repair the ravages of the pre-
vious attack pie was busy with the finishing
brushes when the door at the rear was timor-
ously opened and kathleen appeared

   oh youre back   she said

   im back edward assured her  and
all the worlds a garden of delight kath
old dear everythings ok were off the
rocks again for keeps we can chuck the
whole rotten business and take up angora
rabbit breeding or ostrich-farming or any-
thing else you like

  oh edward how splendid  

   my adjective exactly murmured robert
 you said edward  being now passable
if not presentable may catch that train youd
such a hankering for

   dont go yet said kathleen as robert
having risen obediently took his hat and
moved towards the door

   why not   he demanded

   because you blithering idiot youre still
draped in the firms overall said edward
kathleen advancing extricated him

   its my conviction that you two have
met before said edward with a hash of
intuition

  his sister faced him calmly

   and suppose we have  

   then theres some sort of mystery in cold
storage and as i like my mysteries limited
to fiction the beggar had better stay and
have some lunch

   if you imagine that mr dacre-

  mr dacre said edward with another
flash of intuition  is going to shake hands
and cry quits

   er-quite so said robert

e			a

 magazine

  it was nearly three oclock when robert
emerged from the tube station at the marble
arch and there he practically ran into ann
peebleshire who lived quite near

  he was conscious of a curious and original
sensation-something between disloyalty and
embarrassment

   good-afternoon said ann

   good-afternoon said robert raising
his hat

   oh good gracious  said ann her
voice rose in a hysterical squeak  what
have you been doing  

   doing  

   to your hair how utterly ghastly  

   im sorry

   so am i i dont suppose it was your
fault but whoevers responsible ought to be
stopped from barbering altogether even
with your hat on its awful you oughtto go
into a monastery or somewhere for a month
 theyd make me cut it shorter still there
 i suppose it was partly my fault and im
frightfully sorrv and all that but you
mustnt dream of coming to see me or-or
asking me to marry you or any silliness
of that sort until your hairs properly grown
again

   i wont

  there was a little pause

   you dont bear malice do you   said
ann there was something in his manner
she could not analyse but then bright young
thing as she was ann wasnt really clever

   not a bit much obliged for the warning
good-bye

  he took a taxi back to his rooms in front
of the mirror over the dining-room mantel-
piece he surveyed himself critically ann was
right it was ghastly at least a fortnight
must eiapse before he could call and see her
why didnt lie care more  the fact remained
that he didnt care at all

   extraordinary said robert to himself
 one of those pyschological problems which
itd take another woman to explain i bet
kathleen would be able to-shes the under-
standing type

  and the next- day still worried by the
problem and remembering that he owed the
hair apparent



weetlakes his fare to town he went down to
polders end again

  robert was quick to notice that the swing-
ing sign which yesterday displayed the
elite hairdressing and manicure establish-
ment had now been re-placed by another
of more sinister appearance announcing that
 from to-morrow this business will be under
entirely new management

  he gave a pleasant sigh as he entered the
barbery interior but soon discovered from
the temperamental one that kathleen was
out

   were chucking the business here right
away as you can see said edward a
local man takes over to-morrow my sisters
keen on a flat in kensington spent most of

yesterday evening studying maps and adver-
tisements hipplewhite gardens secis to
be final choice

  thats a turning ofi my road said
 robert his heart performing inexplicable
 evolutions  we may become near neigh-
 bours

  possibly said edward not as though it
 really mattered much

 rut several other people knew better-
 robert when he looked into those kitten-
 eyes again and kathleen when she saw that
 brown weirdly cropped head and of course
 cupid

 and afterwards ann

 but she didnt go to the wedding

comments of current events in lighter vein

by robert magill

illustrated by george thompson

    see that the latest fashion for a man at a
dance is to wear one glove on the hand
tbat be puts behind the girl to hold her
up in case she slips over his big feet the idea
being that he wont soil her frock or if she is
wearing one of those frocks that starts on a
low note that his cold band doesnt make her
shiver

  this reminds me that i have dozens of
gloves stored awav at home but none cf them
in pairs because i never have two gloves
together for five minutes before  lose one
i lose only gloves i never lose one sock or
one shoe and  never lose both gloves but
when  come back from a walk  sort of check
things over  have brought back myself
my hat my stick my dog my wife if  took
her out with me and there
is one glove but the
other-

  i dont know why this
is unless perhaps gloves
get to hate each other and
get a divorce as soon as is
possible my case is not -
singular everybody
knows that if you put two
gloves on the hall table
overnight there will be
only one there in the
morning so that unless
one glove turns cannibal 
and eats the other there is
no explanation mean-

while  always go out with two gloves
one  wear and the other like a little
gentleman i carry in my hand i couldnt
wear it if  tried because they are both
built for the left band

  in the spring a young mans fancy is sup
posed to turn to thoughts of love but seeing
how the winds blow and the rain rains and the
fog and snow and hail and stuff get worse and
worse his thoughts really turn towards
brompton lozenges and lung tonic anyhow
its silly to try and make love to a girl when
your nose is running and all you can say to her
is something like  by darlidg you are the
bost charbidg dabsel id the world will
you barry be  

  even married men seem to suffer as much
from colds in the spring as
single ones which is
strange when you consider
y-	how carefully their wives

  make them keep their
  woollen underthings on and
  wrap themselves up but
  quite likely when a man
  suffers from matrimony it
  undermines his constitution
  and he tails an easy prey
  to any roving microbe

  consequently when my
  young friend cuthbert
  went to work the other
  morning with a bead that
  felt as though it was lull of

   in the spring

	a young mans

	fancy--
host to guest who has done nothing but waste ammunition all day  by the way you re
not connected with the rspca by any chance 

dissatisfied customer firing parting shot  you oughter be sandbagged with a pound

                              of your own sugar


boiling water a nose that was stopped up
and a voice so hoarse ihat t- sounded like the
last notes of a gramophone a the sprma runs
down he was not surprised he knew hed
got his usual spring cold
now the trouble about having a cold is that
it isnt only your cold you cant enjoy it
alone everybody you meet wants to share
it with vou and they ail know something
that will cure it mind you they know only
specifics tor colds they never know the best
thing to do tor a floating kidney or a loose
liver but there are so many infallible ures
for a cold that one wonders why so many
people suffer from colds ali the time unless
perhaps they go out and catch cold deliberately
so that they can practise
their cures
anyhow when cuthbert
went into his boss and said

 good bordidg sir the
boss looked quite pleased
and said  ah cuthbert i
see youve got a cold

you would have thought
he was sherlock holmes
then he went on   know
a splendid thing for a cold
my lad stay at home to-
night and rub your chest all
over with camphorated oil

  the typist on the other
hand didnt believe in cam-
phorated oil she told inm
to go home and eat plenty
of gruel with some paraffin in it cuthbert
thinks she said paraffin although it might
have been paregoric

  at lunch time a friend of his said  theres
only one thing co do with a cold you want
to feed it so cuthbert fed it on a chop a
steak a portion of pork-pie some jam-roil
a slab of cake a tea a coffee and a cocoa
some cheese and the back page of the menu
which adhered to the cheese but later on
another man said you ought to starve a cold
so cuthbert starved it until tea-time

  meanwhile the cold behaved like all colds
it got worse and then stayed the same thank
you until it got worse again tor a change

 i  

a faint flavour of peppermint when
he drank the camphorated oil

magazine

they say that a cold will last twenty-one
days if vou dont do anything tor it whereas
on the other hand if you have expert advice
it lasts three weeks cuthbert bad already
had enough advice to make it last sis months
but there was more to come
ht sneezed the hat oti a man in the train
and the man said the only remedy for a cold
was to eat a large raw onion he didnt say
how it cured the cold but perhaps the idea is
that the smel chokes all the microbes so that
they cant breathe and die of suffocation

  by now cuthbert was feeling so soiry for
himself that he was prepared to try anything
and when the man next door met him at the
gate cuthbert got out a piece of paper and a
pencil ready to write down
the next certain cure the
man next door said  dont
you take any notice of the
silly things people say to
you you take a bottle of
whisky to bed and drink it
by and bv you either wont
have any cold or else youll
feci so happy that you wont
care if youve got ten colds
this being so cuthbert
went into the dmmg-room
and sneezed a picture off
the wall then he turned
round sneezed himself
backwards across the room
till he bumped his head on
the mantelpiece and
knocked a vase into the fender mrs cuthbert
came in looked at him once and said 

   darling youve got a cold

  he admitted it it was of no use trying to
conceal it he was sneezing the whitewash
off the ceiling she made him go straight to
bed while she prepared a mustard - plaster
the idea of this is to draw the cold out she
put enough mustard in it to draw uuthbert
himself out oi bed
meanwhile he found an onion the whisky
the camphorated oil and most of the other
things hed been told about he meant to
try the lot and leave nothing to chance there
might be several kinds of colds and he didnt
                                   iw jit r 

she i never thought you would dare to kiss me  he  well there was a good
deal oj danger about it so-er-i thousht wed better face it together

heroic person  courage sir ill have you out m a minute mean-
while as it is possible that you will require a new suit may i tender my
card  i represent a well-known tailoring firm
e mroisr magaim

know which kind his was but with luck hed
cure ifc

  he had eaten part of the onion when his
mother-in-law came up she had called and
had heard about his cold like everybody else
she knew the right thing to do and shed
brought him some tablets made to a secret
specification of her own although when she
had made him cat three he could have guessed
what they contained it was glue ink soap
coal varnish and mud they blended beau-
tifully with the onion but he found it im-
possible to taste the whisky although he did
detect a faint flavour of peppermint when he
drank the camphorated oil of course he
ought not to have drunk
that but he was too far
gone now to worry he
would have eaten the
mustard plasters too if
mrs cuthbert hadnt
stopped him

  he had no cold left next
morning the fact of the
matter was that he was
afraid to sneeze in case he
met somebody else with
some further horrible
remedy to suggest

  no man who is proud of
the name of englishman
neglects to take his cold tub
every morning it is
always called a tub although it is really a
tin enamelled bath when i say that he
takes a cold bath he claims that he takes
it anyway although i have my own opinion

  a cold bath is undoubtedly very good for
you after you have taken your early morning
exercise and opened your pores your cold
bath shuts them again so that you can have a
quick rub down and open them once more
you may ask what is the use of all this opening
and shutting and whether it wouldnt save
trouble to leave the pores ajar but the answer
is that all the best people do it

  moreover your cold bath braces the nerves
makes the circulation of the blood brisker

so keep your clothes on while you have
your hath

and increases the appetite besides in course
of time it makes you go blue all over and
stay blue which is a very pretty effect if
you wear one of the latest pink shirts

  unfortunately a cold bath is not always
very pleasant when you undress and stand
on the cold oilcloth you feel that nothing on
earth could make you any colder but there is
something that will you put your foot in
the water it freezes your foot your blood
turns to ice and you can feel it in little
pieces all tinkling against each other as they
go through your veins you breathe ice
after having more or less wetted yourself
over you try to wipe your self dry but the
towel only makes you
wetter until you give it up
and dress before you get
covered with a sheet of
ice then as you get warm
again you turn into one
large chilblain

  all this however need
not happen if you take
your cold bath in an in-
telligent fashion for ex-
ample if the oilcloth feels
cold take up the carpet
in the drawing-room and
have a good coke fire built
somewhere in the bath-
room

  even now the water in
the bath will be cold-if
youve been fool enough to
turn on the cold tap

  but why not fill it from the other one 
its still a cold bath only youre using hot
water

  finally you may still feel cold when you
undress in which case why undress  keep
your clothes on while you have your bath i
admit that you will get them wet if you go
into the water this being so carry the
matter further and don a raincoat or put up
an umbrella that is if you re not superstitious
but why get into the water after all 

  its only a matter of using common-sense as
you can see

  w charm sincerity and laughter make this story one of the best yet

fymh may coeemafl

many old tales there are of
bold knights who did battle
for fair ladies and in strange
landcs they slew fiery dragons
and with one blow felled an hundred villaines
winning the captive maid from her tower
through the strength and potency of true
love

  and to this day it is certain sure that true
love conquers all though the frightening
dragons are subtly hid from mortal eye and
the landscape holds no moated grange and
fretted tower but only great painted sign-
boards flaunting themselves on hilltops where
once a castle might have stood

   you are now two miles from brentown
the billboard informed henry bryant  site
of the university of east anglia the town
was fortified in  by a band of rebels led
by giles watt and-

  but who can pause for prose when the road
winds like a poem between woodlands in full
leaf and the cut-out unforbidden sings a
pasan to the slanting hills certainly not a
stern critic of ear performance who is perfectly
satisfied certainly not a young man resplen-
dent in a suit of tweeds the prince of wales
might have envied who has just received
another raise from the dalmartin motor com-
pany and is on business bent

  henry had advanced by hard work from the
oil-mapped overalls of the mechanic to the
dusty sweater of the automobile road tester
now-thanks to his device for improving the
dalmartin carburettor-he was rolling on
balloon tyres on the royal road called easy
street for the last three months he had been

jjlustrated by

gllis  touring the eastern counties his

wlsom	e peasant one showing

          dealers and garage men how the
addition of a little gadget in-
vented by a bright young man would increase
dalmartin mileage not work--a holiday he
called it each day a fresh road  each night
sound sleep in some pleasant country inn no
worries no regrets

   for years henry had had regrets at the
time he had had to quit school he burned with
ambition to go to a university-to be a crack
football player of course and to become-
well probably a lawyer what chance had a
fellow without an education  and for years
henry had felt himself handicapped univer-
sity men lawyers professors and such like
had a mysterious advantage he felt abashed
in their presence and envious for years the
ten magic letters  university staring at
him as now on the great billboard would
have been sufficient to plunge him into gloom

   but to-day henry read the flashing sign
without a pang it was a wholly happy young
man who asked of heaven nothing more that
the good citizens of brentown beheld rolling
at lordly ease through their main thorough-
fare sliding with silken exactness to a stop
just a cars length beyond the petrol pump in
front of carsons garage

   here henry was at once surrounded by a
group that included sam carson his chief
mechanic the mechanics helper the freckle-
faced boy who tended the petrol tank and
all the drivers not on duty for sam supplied
the towns taxi service and after henrys
work of art-just take a look at the present
love conquers all



dalmartin carburettor if you dont believe it
deserves the title-had been viewed in and
out of action had been taken apart and put
together by every one of them they stood
about for a while and gossiped oh about

cars of course  what else  earth is there 
they inspected henry s special six in
detail they followed him as he made the
rounds ot the cars m the garage one by one
as a liorseman does a stable they opened up

  a delightful vision in a dress
of heavens own blue and
crowned with a wide-brimmed
halo a halo in henrys eyes


e	magazine

the hood of an old chain-drive mirador and
looked over its mighty pre-war cylinder block
their eyes beaming with worshipful admira-
tion that mechanics have for a noble piece of
machinery they respectfully watched henry
turn over the engine for theres a knack about
cranking these old cars and then with rapt
attention of a concert audience they all
listened a while blissfully to the exhaust

  at last henry and sam strolled to the outer
doorway to talk out the finale of their business
henry with a large smudge on his left cheek
and another round his right eye because he
had forgotten that his hands were covered
with that composition of grease oil carbon
and road dust which garages seem able to
produce in inexhaustible quantities but this
was henrys native element you might say
and a happier person you couldnt have found
in all norfolk or suffolk as he stood idly
watching the sun peer through the avenue of
over-arching trees that marked the beginning
of the residence section

  and then a funny thing happened  henry
saw a vision advancing through the pat-
terned light and shade she came a most
unusual delightful apparition in a dress oi
heavens own blue and crowned with a wide-
brimmed halo-no a hat of course-that shed
a golden radiance over the sweetest demurest
most adorable face in the world

  now the hat was an old one which had done
duty many summers as ann forrester could
have told you and the dress was a faded blue
chambray made by aunt geneva in the simple
style she was mistress of ann always wore
such frocks because-oh because aunt geneva
made them and because anns father pro-
fessorforresterreceived a monthly stipend that
couldnt be stretched beyond-oh well what
did clothes matter anyway  especially to a
girl who read latin and greek as fast as most
people read movie captions who divided her
time between the university lecture room and
the library at home and who had only to
open a book to wear robes of splendour in
whatever fashion and clime she fancied who
could become k divinely fair  or  with hair
like the ravens wing according to her mood

  this delightful arrangement however kept

ann from any great satisfaction when she
looked in the mirror her nose was strrght
what there was of it her lips were red her
eyes were blue like the roses and violets of
the old rhyme and thank heaven her eye
lashes werent so short and sandy that you
couldnt see them like sarah kimballs but

compared to what might have been-

  no of course ann never dreamed that
by merely walking down brentown high
street on a summers afternoon she made
the blue sky seem bluer to henry bryant
and the sunlight brighter and brighter
culminating in a burst of brilliance as she
stopped at the garage door where he and
sam carson were standing

   will you send a cab mr carson   said
ann  im going to belton this afternoon
 to visit your aunt emily  

  ann nodded and conscious of henrys
eyes on her she looked up at him which
made sam say

   miss forrester-mr bryant of the
dalmartin company

   how do you do   said henry putting
out his hand and then quickly snatching it
back again

   oh you ought to see your face  said
sam laughing out loud

  and aim had to smile

  but henry didnt up and turn the joko
back on sam or excuse himself to ann or pull
out his initialed linen handkerchief and ask
her for a bit of help tidying up as he would
have done with most girls he just stood
there looking at ann not saying a word
how could he speak when his mind was racing
like an engine gone mad whirling and hurry-
ing with thoughts - strange wonderful
thoughts like music which couldnt be put
into words 

   going on the five oclock   said sam to
ann

   yes therell be a trunk its little but
its heavy

   full o books i  pronounced sam know-
ingly  got to expect that from professor
forresters daughter

   professor forresters daughter   henry
stammered in a funny choking voice
love conquers all



   and well-nigh as smart as her dad right
now from what i heard up at the university
shell be takm his job away from him one o
these days 

  ann smiled at this pleasantry then with a
nod of good bye to sam and the fleetest
glance and the quickest little tilt of the head
to henry on down the street she sped to
fantles grocery shop where she had to get a
dozen fruit-jar rings for aunt geneva

  there wasnt the slightest need for haste
but so fast ami hurried you might have
thought her little black slippers were running
away with her so fast was her heart beating
and so hot and flushed were her cheeks
that mr fantle warned her against sunstroke
and cautioned her to keep on the shady side
of the street

  and this ann did the whole long round-
about way home she felt that she would
rather die than walk back past carsons
garage at the same time she felt she would
die if she didnt and strange considering
the heat of the day she climbed the hill twice
yes when almost at the top she turned and
was three turnings back toward town before
she turned again and slowly retraced her steps

  strange too that the visit to aunt emilys
farm to which she always looked forward
every year should suddenly seem unnecessary
and interminable a whole week  and my
the time it took her to finish packing that
little trunk though all she had to do was to
lay in four freshly ironed dresses  such
terrible home-made looking clothes  with a
certain violence she suddenly took all the
books out of the trunk so that the despicable
garments need not be crushed

  for an hour she stood at the window
though aunt geneva assured her the taxi
wasnt due for full fifty-five minutes when
it finally came and father and aunt geneva
bade her have a good trne her smile was as
forced as those ancient martyrs who made
merry while being boiled m oil and atter she
got on the train she cned

  those who carp at feminine lack of logic
should observe the more reasonable behaviour
of tne male henry when ann disappeared
round the corner he dashed back into the

garage after one minute sixteen seconds
intimate association with soap-suds he
dashed out to his car and immediately
smudged his hands getting screw-dnver and
pliers out ot the tool-box

  there was nothing to prevent the lordly
young man who had driven into brentown but
an hour ago from standing cool and clean
in the doorway waiting tor a pretty girl to
repass the garage indeed he had done just
that little thing many a time and had
enjoyed being kidded about the peach 

  but the lordly young man had vanished
though he looked no different to the envious
eyes of the boy who tended the petrol tank
the resplendent tweeds now clothed a humble
despairing wretch who felt that he dare not
profane a vision by being seen watching for
her and who would have knocked down any
man who referred to her as a peach

  doggedly he worked in the hot sun attack-
ing bolts that couldnt be made any tighter
and screws that wouldnt turn another milli-
meter from time to time sam carson
commiserated with him upon getting hung up
all the afternoon recommended rolling the
car inside begged to assist henry in his
labours sams offers were of no avail henry
did not budge until he was sure that ann
could not possibly pass carsons garage and
still catch the five oclock train

  then he accomplished his departure with a
convincing exhibition of speed thirty-five
seconds of shouted farewells blended with the
roar of the cut-out he had the car up to
sixty by the end of the high street and
skidded the corner as only professionals
can henrys admirers in the garage doorway
presaged that he couldnt help but make
lowestoft by six oclock

  out of their sight henry kicked off the cut-
out and headed for the station all he wanted
from ann was a glance if not ot approval of
tolerance merely permission to inhabit
territory that brought her within his range of
vision but a hundred yards from the station
panic seized him the panic of a gambler for
whom the stakes are so high he dare not risk
the chance ot loss diving down an alley
henry deserted the car and-hidden in the

shadow on the far side of the goods-shed-he	truck saw her get o she was greeted by a

mournfully watched ann get on the train for	plump red-cheeked woman who was probably

belton 	aunt emily and whisked away in an old

  he then burned up the belton road beat	ford driven by a boy in overalls

anns train in and concealed behind a goods-	instead of asking the station-master aunt
emilys last name and where she lived henry
elaborately inquired the way to the beltorf
garage though he had already noted it on
his way through town there in a rambling
conversation he achieved after some hours
the information he sought without any direct
questions

  twice he was along the road to aunt emiles
farm and turned back the third time he
passed it the house was dark but his search-
light verified the name on the letter-box
at eleven oclock supperless ho started for
lowestoft

  by half-past four the next afternoon he

   meew magazine

was back in belton this time the dalmartin
sis without hesitation with perhaps a
certain desperation swung off the highway
and took the rougher roads with unslacked
speed skimming the hills on high like a
thoroughbred hound it was a crime against
magnificent car performance for henry to
apply the brakes when he did

  jumping out he unscrewed the radiator
cap a cloud of steam issued forth was it
possible that he had forgotten to put in
water nothing for it he must ask at
the nearest house for a bucketful

  as he advanced between the whitewashed
stones that marked the path to the front door
ann appeared on the porch

   why miss forrester  said henry
with a great show of surprise

   why mr bryant  said ann and she
too was terribly surprised

   i-a-run out of water

  the steam obligingly ascending heaven-
ward bore henry witness

   i-a-ann almost said  was stand-
ing at the window but she would rather
have cut out her tongue than admit that i
heard you stop all of a sudden

   marvellous brakes on these cars henry
assured her  four wheel internal expand-
ing drums special dalmartin fabric lining
id like to show-if you could spare the
time-that is right now

  this ann understood was an invitation
to go for a ride though how could she
mistake it with henrys eyes beseeching
pleading humbly imploring  and how could
henry think that she wasnt going when
anns blue eyes gave answer in the sweetest
shyest glance  but he was like a drowning
man until he heard her words

    cant go far said ann a little breath-
lessly  suppers almost ready id better
get my hat she paused with her hand on
the knob of the screen door  you want
a bucket of water dont you  

   seems to have cooled o said henry
who ieit that the slightest delay was perilous
ss i can fill it up when we get back

  after ann explained to aunt emily that it
wan only mr bryant-everybody knew him

in brentown-and that of course shed be
back for supper she came out in her old
shady hat and pink chambrav dress looking
as cool as a dewy tea rose henry meshed
the gears with his customary velvet touch
but a thermometer under either of their
tongues would have registered high fever

  aunt emily watched them out of sight
thinking what a good time folks have nowa-
days little could she fathom the misery
that can be compressed in half an hour

  though there was not four inches between
them henry could not believe that ann had
actually come with him ann couldnt believe
that henry actually wanted her in the
car they seemed to have lost the art of
speech anything they could think of to say
seemed far too tame and uninteresting to
offer for the consideration of such an extra-
ordinary being as the other

  henry risked mining the car for he had
purposely well-nigh drained the radiator but
stopping seemed to involve dire and frightful
consequences as though ann would utterly
disappear if he left her to go into some farm-
house for water lest he commit the un-
pardonable sin of not getting ann back in
time for supper he kept a hectic eye on the
dashboard clock ann noticing this immedi-
ately concluded that he was sorry he had
asked her to ride and was anxious to get it
over with

  so as if pursued by demons they tore
through miles of beautiful scenery which
neither of them saw and-though henry
distinctly said that the car wasnt tuned up
but hed show ann what it would do if she
could possibly spare the time to-morrow and
though ann distinctly stated that she could
spare the time-they parted with the leeling
that they had not heard aright and would
probably never see each other again

 the next day-

   oh how do you do mr bryant said
ann so casually formal that no one could
suspect her of actually wanting to see him
she had been teased by aunt emily and her
cousins and she knew they were all listening
at the window

   when we get back aunt emily would be
love conquers all



glad if you will stay for supper she con-
tinued issuing aunt emilys friendly in-
vitation quite unwillingly henry ann felt
was used to far more pretentious affairs than a
farmhouse supper she was terrified too that
her cousins might continue their jokes in
his presence

   i have a dinner engagement with one of
the dalmartin dealers henry said speaking
not one word of truth he could see aunt
emily inspecting him through the lacecurtains
and in a chill of fear he hurried ann to the
car before this sharp-eyed relative could have
time to note all his unworthiness the after-
noon netted forty miles of desperate efforts at
conversation

  and thus it went through a whole week of
increasing torture

  ann cried every night because she was such
an ordinary looking person and had such
terrible clothes and hadnt ever been any-
where and couldnt talk about anything

  henry became worn and haggard as the
mileage on his speedometer piled up driving
to lowestoft each night covering the towns
in that vicinity each morning on business
and returning to belton by mid-afternoon
he could have had a few days holiday for
the asking or he could have invented excuses
that he had to take down the engine that he
was going fishing with a customer who might
be important but his imagination endowed
the dalmartin company with the power to
see through any subterfuge at all costs
they must not know must not know what 
a pretty girl in the car with him was no news
surely

  but obeying an unreasoning urge for
secrecy he performed prodigies of speed and
endurance merely to keep anyone from
suspecting that he said  how do you do
miss forrester nice day isnt it   and that
half an hour or so later he heard  thank yon
so much mr bryant it was a lovely ride

  true there was one afternoon when in
just another minute they would have been
calling each other  ann  and  henry
they had stopped for some field flowers
because ann had said  oh arent they
lovely   and henry  want some i  jam-

ming on the brakes there were blackberry
brambles to be held aside low walls for ann
to be helped across and a little brook with
stepping stones

  constraint seemed to vanish as they
wandered in the meadow where the growing
things were gently happy in the sunshine
they became natural and at ease as they
gathered the white and gold daisies yarrow
with scented leaves furry spikes of mullen
thistle and milkweed that must be captured
warily

   with laden arms they still lingered sharing
the little excitement of the scene-an ant
climbing a blade of grass a spider escaping
by a swiftly spun rope a humming bee
poised over a belated wild rose branches of
wild honeysuckle they stole from the butter-
flies and stalks of rose red clover from the
bees-the sleek treasure hoarding honey
bees which ancient poets celebrate in many
a noble line as ann watched an eager
robber bun-owing into the very blossoms in
her hand she commended him with a lino
from theaeritus

    what language was that   asked henry
abruptly

   greek said ann abashed at henrys
tone and the look of strange intensity in his
eyes

  in a flash the sense of happy intimacy was
gone

   he must think im crazy ann told
herself  people dont go around quoting
things every minute like father

  and she bemoaned her life in the narrow
confincs of a little university town her lack
of social experience in the great outside
world from which henry came

  how could she know that her chance words
came as an interdiction a reminder that
she was a being from that magic sphere which
had been denied to henry the thought of
which now a thousandfold plunged him in
the depths of despair  how could ann know
her loveliness so comparable with her burden
of flowers-the sweet gravity of her eyes
the sunset flush on her cheeks the rosy
freshness of her lips

  because henry so longed to take her in his


ae	magazine

arms he guided her across the low
wall with distant courtesy because ann
bo rejoiced in his touch she quickly drew her
unwanted hand from his lest it betray her
bo deep was their humility and so high their
pride that they held themselves stiffly apart

  that night when the rest of the
foouse slept ann stared up into the
dark with tear-flooded eyes and
wished she were dead and henry
drove his car with savage ferocity
wondering whether he could make a
good clean smash of it if he headed
straight for a tree

  with aching heads on the morrow
they started for bren town site of
the east anglican university ann
was going home henry by his
own request was taking her thither

the end of the week had come
the end of anns visit to aunt
emily the end obviously of
everything

  with concentrated speed and
directness henry drove to his doom

he feared professor forrester that
mild impractical scholar seemed to
him not an ogre but a cold
justifiable off-with-his-head kind of
judge he feared the professors
house its very walls would pro-
claim him as an alien he feared
aunt geneva she clearly showed
herself to be in league with aunt
emily against him aunt geneva
had invited him to tea

  a letter ann had received only
that morning bade her be sure to
ask mr bryant to stop for tea
after their long ride timidly ann
made the suggestion explaining
that while her father always had
sunday teas during the regular
university term for his students this would
be a much nicer tea than usual aunt
geneva had written that some of the summer
school faculty would be present

  engrossed with this added horror henry
gave undivided attention to the road ann
stared fixedly at the scenery to keep from

crying plainly enough the best she had to
offer a faculty tea was ol no interest to
henry

  side by side impersonal as strangers in
the enforced companionship oi a train they
completed the ghastly journey ann with a

brave show of indifference led the way up
the pansy-bordered walk henry quite as
nonchalantly held open the low porch-door
that would soon be closed to him lor ever
with spartan heroism they entered the
living room

  lined from floor to ceiling with books it
love conquers all



had the mellow charm ease and usage
professor forrester thin and stooped was
distinguished by that look of other worldli-
ness which marks the scholar the group of
men to whom henry was introduced were
all  professors  or  dons

  ann saw only the shabby rug threadbare
and faded the miscellany of worn chairs
her fathers thin locks awry and that albert
the professors assistant had not-failing
the reminders of his wife who was away
visiting his mother-remembered to change

his shirt she sank on a low stool near her
father leaving the remaining rocking-chair for
henry

  picture if you can daniel in the lions den
in a rocking-chair that was henry en-
deavouring to appear at ease with the lions-
no the professors of
course-who tried po-
litely to include him
in their conversation
it was the shop talk of
scholars talk of books
a recent analysis of
confucius by a french-
man a new swedish
survey of philosophy
a treatise on ancient
industries by a german
colleague whose de-
ductions called forth a
counterflood of refer-
ences long citations in
greek and latin and
in sanskrit

  henry avoiding the
glances that invited
him to participate in
rending this author
limb from limb lis-
tened in defenceless
silence

  ann too was silent
feeling herself trapped
by things with which
she had no concern
these trivialities of
times long past-how
had she even thought
they mattered  quib-
bles about dead words
dead customs people
who had been dead
these many hundred
because henry so yars- er father and
longed to take her in his his friends she saw
arms he guided ann nowfor the first time
across the low wall with tlie eyes of the
with distant courtesy undergraduates who
called them old

always felt superior to that crowd but they
were right they lived in the present and
she might have learned from them-learned
how to dress to be attractive and to talk
of something ot interest to a man of the world
like henry now alas it was too late
henry looked bored to extinction he had
not said a word

  what could henry say  apropos of a
new history ot trade and colonisation by some
hyphenated professor he could scarcely remark
that it was a nice day yet those fiendish
professors kept turning to him oftener and
oftener as they disagreed with each other
about the average englishmans ideas on
roman colonisation the two right and left
of henry fought a battle almost in his lap
both fairly yammering at him to confirm
arguments which the other wouldnt admit
concerning modern colonising in africa and
south america here at least were names
henry recognised

   but the way they jump on that author
who must know a little something what
would they do to a yellow who knows nothing
but the names 

  with despairing eyes he renounced ann
sitting so coldly aloof-mortified undoubtedly
at his exhibition of ignorance and his heart
sank lower if possible as he heard her crisply
supply her father with a date he asked her
help in recalling

   good-bye miss forrester good-bye i
will never forget you

  but those werent the words he was saying
for suddenly he found himself speaking
yes talking right out with assurance and
authority  dominating the conversation

  the discussion had veered to early forti-
fications of the eastern counties and the
mingled races of our ancestry-english
welsh danes-even germans

   there were early evidences of bi-racial
characteristics in the sixteenth century re-
bellions said professor forrester  i forget
the year

   sixteen-thirty-nine henry heard him-
self announcing he could see the curve in
the road and the great signboard with its
black and red letters standing before him

 you are now two miles from brentown site
of the university of east anglia the town
was fortified in sixteen-thirty-nine by a band

of rebels led by giles watt- and henry

went on

ranging the whole of the eastern counties
which he had just travelled he read towns
dates and facts from the billboards that
flashed in procession through his excited
mind he would have gone on indefinitely not
knowing how to stop had not aunt geneva
entered through a door near him with a laden
tea-tray

henry sprang up gallantly and took it
from her and there was a general stir to
proffer chairs and to arrange the tea-table in
aunt genevas preferred corner

 i envy you your retentive memory
for dates professor forrester told henry
 they usually escape me

 you specialise in english history  
asked professor hampton

 no said henry truthfully yet fully
aware he was heightening his triumph

carefully he placed the tea-tray before aunt
geneva who thanked him with her placid
kindly smile

then quickly he crossed the room to ann
she stood in a corner folding the cover which
adorned the tea-table when not in hos-
pitable use quickly quickly for there was
not a moment to lose henry bent down and
spoke low in her ear

 will you marry me   he said

ann looked up at him astonished un-
believing

 if-if you want me to she faltered her
blue eyes searching his face

 no no you mustnt  said henry

he couldnt trick those trusting eyes with
a bluff he wasnt anns sort he wasnt
good enough for her he couldnt let her make
such an awful mistake

 i-ive got to tell you the truth ive got
to explain

he pulled ann toward the door the table
cover trailing between them and down the
porch steps to the car

though his hand was tight on anns wrist
she thought he was going to leave her
love conquers all



dont go away she sobbed softly
 oh dont go away  

 aunt geneva peered out of the window
 and seeing them get in the car she came
 out on the porch

arent you going to have your tea
she called

 but the dalmartin sis carried them gallantly
 out of danger

 past mocking university buildings past
 houses with prying eyes to a tree-sheltered
 road in the woods

there ann and henry discovered that the
terrible perilous week was indeed over they
had lived through desperate days and through
nights of despair they had overcome in-
surmountable obstacles had foiled stratagems
and plots

at last they were safe-close in each
others arms

true love as is well known conquers all
well well

the wuknown and witty entertainer at the piano



 i

    often look bark and think what a glorious
group of performers were the artists who
composed the carl rosa company i have
had the honour of appearing at concerts with
such stars of the rosa company as marie
roze georgina burns barton mcguckin
leslie crotty alec marsh and lempriere
pringle all great artists and great bohe-
mians among the stars of a former era with
whom the writer has been associated on the
concert stage were signor foii the glorious
basso his real name was foley and he
came from cork also sir charles santley
mesdames belle cole and albani zeiie de
lussan and that superb baritone william
ludwig he also came from ireland and
his real name was i believe ledwich i
also toured with the original meister glee
singers they may have been excelled since
which t doubt but they were quite in a
class of their own in those days and i had
the proud distinction of appearing with dame
clara butt when she was a slim slip of a girl
she is greater in every way now but is still
the same very charming woman well-
well-those were great days

  just after the last boer war i made a
single-handed tour of the four colonies ol
south africa doing a show lasting two and a
quarter hours i had four different pro-
grammes of this length without repeating an
item all  required was a platform and a
piano people loved a one-man show those
days they dont now-worse luck i am
a peaceful and law-abiding citizen i dont
state this as a merit but as a fact also it
is quite hereditary and so i cannot help it
i just wanted to stop in england and abide
by the law  loathe travelling scenery
and cathedrals are thrown away on me i
have never climbed a mountain and have no

intention of doing so i am easy-going by
nature london with its sights sounds and
smells is good enough for me i regard all
other places as suburbs therefore to go on
tour in south africa was a monumental
exertion tor me to undertake i did not want
to go to south africa and said so repeatedly
but kind and misguided friends insisted that
it was a land flowing with milk and honey
they told me that there were crocks of gold
to be had for the mere picking up so i
went i sailed in one of the union castle
boats i will not name it as i do not wish
to make the other boats jealous let me
warn the intending exile never to be lured on
to the  entertainments committee  of a
liner en route to anywhere believe me its
a mugs game it is a game for good-natured
idiots of which i am a gold medallist from
the second day of the voyage i can honestly
say i never had a moments peace i was
elected entertainments manager with full
powers this meant that i was to do all the
dirty work and the committee were to get all
the credit the talent available on board
was of the most limited dimensions several
people were not only willing but anxious to
do their worst to amuse and they did it
we had one performer from dear old ber-
mondsey and the steerage who recited reels
and reels of shakespeare his greatest effort
was from  king john it was thrilling to
hear the musical accents of bermondsey
declaiming  eat me these hyons ot
there were those who sang comic songs of
the questionable type to vamped accompani-
ments and some of the vamping effects were
weird in the extreme we had a passionate
baritone who trilled the songs of frank
lambert and guy d hardelot those syrupy
meaningless hot-pressed little lyrics ending
a clown in mufti



on the dominant seventh he usually cracked
on the dominant which relieved the tension
somewhat altogether the concerts were a
failure for which i was of course blamed
they were not even bad enough to be good
if you understand what i mean then again
as the parsons say i was dragged into all the
idiotic deck games that passengers are sup-
posed to enjoy i was skelped hip and thigh
with hard coir-yarn cricket balls i was
trussed up to undergo that horrible form of
torture known as cock-fighting i was bifed
off booms with bolsters banged on the bald
spot with sandbags in the peculiarly devilish
game called  are you there  i always
was the inventor of this pastime deserves a
special oven in the future life i repeat that
those who join the  entertainment com-
mittee  on any liner bound for anywhere are
simply asking for it however a voyage
whatever its length comes to an end at last
and  received one tribute at least from an
approving soul it appeared in the
 journal  which was printed and published
on board it was in what purported to be
verse i append the lines exactly as they
appeared there is a rugged virility about

the workmanship which appeals also the

ode to nelson jackson esq

 mr nelson jackson is a smart young man
 his coon songs etc were cleverly sang

 the recitals of jacson were the best on the
 list

and i know that hed beat hamlet right
into fits

 now this gentleman jacksons been the life
 of the ship

 if it had not been for him we should all have
 been asleep

 so with three hearty cheers well cheer him
 to-night

 and thank him sincerely for his coon songs
 so bright

 there it is exactly as it appeared as the
 americans say  can you beat it   the
 reference to hamlet is cryptic and i never
 sang a coon song in my life ill tell you
 more about south africa next month the
 editor permitting

 well think it over--editor

choice

when i see dilys cross the street
with eager hastening little feet

i think lifes sun would brighter shine
if darling dilys could be mine

when i see sweet clarissa row

i think lifes biggest thrill id know

if we for ever in a boat

a-down lifes placid stream could float

when i watch phcebe charleston round

i	think no greater bliss be found

than having her with all her charms

for ever dancing in my arms

but im an ordinary man
who wants the best from life he can

and so i give my heart to rose

who smiles and cooks ard mends my clothes

peter looked up and grinned at
sally then he saw his father
and the grin was frozen into a
grimace of sheer horror

been a perfectly marvellous lunch out of
doors and people were wandering around
now waiting for the golf to begin looking
the place over

  hordes of nice people beautifully dressed
gay and cheerful vivid colourful half a
mile of westchester real estate with a stone
wall around it worth incalculable sums in
terms of building lots eighteen of mr
devereux emmetts very choicest holes for a
private golf course with greens gleaming
like emeralds and traps full ot sea sand as
white as snow brought in lighters and trucks
from long island and hang the expense
and the house rising above the trees grey
stone looking really sally was obliged to

contess like the
french chateau its
architect had copied

  listen-

  sally turned with
a start there was
a young man she
hadnt heard him
come up he looked
worried but very
nice sally thought
she didnt know him
which was that day
a point very much
in his favour she
smiled at him before
she quite knew she
was doing it

 hallo said
sally

  hallo he said
seemingly reheved
 look here tell me
-whos giving this
party and why 

   but good grief
dont you know
she said

 would i be
asking you if i did 
be yourself lady
theres no time to
be lost tell me

 	 oil said sally

 its my aunt at least shes not really my
aunt shes my real aunts husbands second
wife

   i see he said  quite but do you
mind if we go into that some other time 
about how many wives your uncle had
i mean  whats the womans name and
why is she giving this show  

   becausc she wanted to i suppose
said sally

   i wish youd stop trying to be funny
the young man said crossly  havent you
any concentration at all  keep your eye
on the ball whats her name and is this a
garden-party or is lindbergh going to fly
over or what  
	ffie mot

   oh now i sec what you mean said
sally  my aunts name is mis madden and
its just a party to celebrate this new golf
course theyre going to have mixed four-
somes-

   my heavens  said the young man

  sally thought hed have turned pale if he
hadnt been too sunburned to make that
practicable

  and you see her daughter-her step-
daughter i mean my cousin-

   you know he said  i think your
family trees extraordinarily interesting and
all that but thats not the point just now
is it  madden eh  mrs madden whats
she wearing  how do i know her when i
see her  

   bl-black and white voile  sally gasped
u a large white hat

   good  tall short thin fat  

  in between said sally quite-
quite nice-looking her hairs white

   good   said the young man  you
see if you just concentrate youre all right
and off he rushed

  sally arose and followed him she didnt
want to go home any more not until she
found out what this young man wanted

  in a minute she found out her aunt
was introducing him to marjorie romer
and the young man whod been with marjorie
looking incredulous but happy was fading
away swiftly in the direction of a debutante
who had five men already but was perfectly
capable of handling another

   well- said sally to herself then she

smiled wickedly

  all that simply because he had wanted to
meet marjorie

  wild horses couldnt have dragged sally
away now her behaviour was entirely
shameless deliberately she watched the
two of them the young man started in to
talk to marjorie breathlessly but he didnt
get very far before long it was marjorie
who talked sally saw varying expressions
come and go in the young mans eyes-doubt
curiosity suspicion desperation sally bided
her time at what seemed to her the right
moment she struck all she did was wander

l magazine

into the line of the young mans vision she
wanted to see what would happen

  she did he saw her looked at her looked
at her again to make sure then he turned
and paid concentrated attention to marjorie
ruthlessly at what sally was sure was his
first chance he broke in accompanying his
words with a wide free gesture then he
bowed and turned away and came straight
to sally

   hallo   he said  wondering where
you were i was he took out his hand-
kerchief and wiped his forehead  my good
gosh i ought to have known thered be a
catch  but how can you tell that a girl who
looks like thats going to talk like someone
reading a guide book out loud  anything
youd like to know about the english lakes
or the chateau country in france  

   no thanks said saily  but please
id love to know the plot

   plot   he said  plot   then he
smiled a slow smile that grew into a grin
 oh well driving along just so-so got
held up somewhere that girl in the next car
-with a man fell for her fell hard turned
in here after them-saw it was a party you
see came in thought thered be someone i
knew never saw so many people i didnt
know all at oiie time

  saily just listened

   barged aroimd beginning to feel ner-
vous tried to make this girl thought she
gave me a glass eye tried to spot hostess
no go lots of old girls looked as if they
might be hostesses you know

  sally did

   its not funny he complained  thats
your trouble though no seriousness of pur-
pose chap cant count on you got to know
hostess name if youre crashing the gate at a
party havent you  

   i-i suppose it is a help  said saily

   of course elementary that is come
on lets go

   go   said sally startled  go where  
   i dont care   he said  away thats

all you- he looked alarmed  you

dont live here do you 
   no she said  i live in new york
keep your eye on the ball



   good h said  so do i drive you
down have dinner somewhere

   oh i oughtnt-all right-lets  said
sally

  why not  if she didnt go now shed
have to wait around for hours before they
sent her to the station and the train would be
crowded and what good did it do her any-
way to keep in the good graces of an aunt
who wasnt really an aunt at all 

  driving down with peter-she found out
quite soon that his name was peter arm-
strong-was fun

   where were you going originally   she
asked him

   oh just to play golf-it didnt matter he
said  you wouldnt have been thereanyway
everything was all right mitil late when
he began talking about the future

   to-morrows out he said gloomily
 engagement i cant break silly but there
it is monday though thats another day
lunch-dyou mind having it early about
one  and dinner rather late and well do a
musical show so we can miss all we like of
the first act and then we can start seeing if
any of the night clubs are any good this
summer-you know find out where they have
music we both like-darned important that
is-

   stop  she said i cant have lunch at
all on monday and i oughtnt to go out that
night-except-well dinner perhaps if i go
home right away afterwards  have to get
some sleep week nights i work

   work   he said shocked and annoyed
 why bring that up  so do i work thats
why i said an early lunch  i have to beat the
old man back to the office

    you dont have to work the way i do
she said viciously  you dont have to take
dictation all morning and type letters all
afternoon and then stay around for hours
typing half of them over again because youve
made so many mistakes

   maybe he said  but the worst they
can do to you is fire you

   well you cant even be fired  

   youd be surprised you dont know the
male parent a hard-boiled egg if the cook

ever forgot to turn the gas ol imder one
fired  ill say i can be fired and f i am i
get cut off with a dollar too  laugh that off
his voice was increasingly bitter  know
the fast one he pulled on me this morning 
no more golf 

   but you were going to play to-day-

   oh i mean real golf tournament stuff
saturday afternoons and sundays-yes says
i cant concentrate on business and tourna-
ment golf too 

sally laughed to his annoyance she
wasnt appalled as hed expected her
to be

   i dont see why you had to start talking
about work he said and quite soon he
took her home to the dull respectable upper
west side block where she shared an apart-
ment with a couple of other girls from the
office-which wasnt where shed been brought
up by any means in the days before her
father had died suddenly without leaving any
money and her aunt had made her uncle do
the right thing by her in the way of a secre-
tarial course peter got out with her and they
stood and looked at one another

  well said sally good night mr
armstrong

   peter he said absently  oh hang  
 whats the matter with you id like to
know   she said crossly

   im just trying to think he said  its

so mixed up-

   i dont see-

   oh hush of course you dont  said
peter  cant you take my word for it  if

i tried to explain- he shook his head

 no use have to wait

  she stared at him mystified and then he
did what absolutely nothing hed said or done
all day had warned her to expect he grabbed
her suddenly and kissed her most unskilfully
somewhere under the left eye and then let
her go

   you just leave it to me he said  itll
come out all right good-night 

  and before she could catch her breath
much less say anything he was in the car
and going off


magazine

  i well  said sally as she let herself in
 what a day  sally considering the times
she lived in hadnt been kissed much and
now shed been kissed twice in one day

  twice-yes the first kiss hasnt come up
before but it had happened even though
subsequent events had rather banished the
memory of it from sallys mind until the last
event of all recalled it sharply

  peters kiss meant nothing sally knew
that arthur butlers kiss though which had
occurred much earlier in the day in the taxi
in which hed taken her to the station had
been different it had meant nothing to sally
but a lot to arthur arthur was not one of
your light and casual kissers as peter pro-
bably was but what was she to do 

  sunday was a blank mercifully but
monday at the office was terrible sallys
head ached and shed forgotten what little
she had ever known about a typewriter and
her spelling always original became grotesque
arthur wanted her to have lunch and she
wouldnt and then he called up again nob
to ask her to dinner but just to say hed
broken an engagement so that they could
dine together a command not an invitation
she said she couldnt and he hung up
ominously and when she started home well
after six he was waiting for her down-
stairs

   youre late he said

   do you suppose i dont know it  
was peter coming to take her to dinner or
wasnt he she hadnt heard a word from

him  arthur-

   yes 

  you know everything is there a golf
player called armstrong  a-a well-known
one i mean 

   peter armstrong  of course plays
for baltamis be pretty good if hed take
the game seriously doesnt concentrate
lasted to the semi-final in the amateur
last year though at that

   oh  said sally

   why cant you have dinner with me  
   im going out

   with a man  

   i dont know

   sally dont equivocate of course you
know 

  then she got a respite while he selected
a taxi something he always did with care
there was this about arthur though he
could afford to take a girl home to south
brooklyn even in a taxi to say nothing of
the upper west side

   sally he said gravely when they
were in the cab  i dont want to press
you but after all now that were en-
gaged-

   engaged   she said with a start

   of course   he said  after what

happened saturday-

  she racked her aching head yes hed
kissed her just as they reached the station
and shed rim for her train then while he
paid off the cab

   but- she began

  then she stopped she couldnt think of
any tactfully kind way to tell him that
shed have let almost any man kiss her
saturday noon the way she was feeling
rather than get into an argument so she
just closed her eyes and leaned back
and arthur was chivalrously silent and let
her rest

  she saw peter sitting in another taxi
as they drove up to her house and he must
have seen her too and the way arthur
kissed her good-bye he waited till arthur
had gone off and then followed her into her
vestibule

   hallo  he said  couldnt remember
any of your name except saly had to come
around and catch you going in rotten
hours you keep lit out early to be here
by a quarter to five the old manll think
that shows lack of concentration-thats all
he knows

   you lack something all right said
sally  i told you my name and the tele-
phone and everything

   i know i know he said  concen-
trating on something else thats why i
forgot do i come up or wait in the cab
nice cab little bare though as a home
i was thinking of putting up a few good
etchings
keep your eye on the ball	

   oil you might as well come up  said
sally what difference did it make  a lot
as it turned out the other girls were out
and peter  when they got upstairs proved
that when he was putting his mind to it he
was a perfectly adequate kisser sally was
tired and her head still ached and she liked
having peter kiss her and why not be hung
for a sheep when
it came to that 

  who was that
other bloke  

peter asked pre-
sently

 he said
sally she braced
herself oh
just the man im
engaged to 

 no said
peter he began
to laugh he
roared oh
thats priceless

its great that
makes it all
right

  he kissed her
again but she
had to draw a
line somewhere

   dont peter

- she said

   why not  

   you cant-
when im en-
gaged and you

know it--

   cant see it
said peter  did
i kick and scream
when he kissed
you downstairs  and youre only engaged
to him but youre going to marry me

   what   said sally

  he nodded vigorously

  of course didnt you know that
saturday night  i did

  he took her to a place she liked and did
the ordering and they had all the things

she most loved to eat arthur always took
her to the sort of hotel your provincial aunt
stays at when visiting town and she had to
order for herself because arthur ran to
nourishing broths and chops and plain green
vegetables-spinach for choice

   everything all right   said peter she
just looked at him  good now-how

about being en-
gaged  why
how when all
that  

  when he finally
believed her he
laughed

  oh well he
said if thats
all if a chaps
coot enough to
think a girls
going to marry
him just because
hes kissed her

 

 but-yo u
seem to think that

yourself-

  thats differ-
ent he said
sternly  and
anyway its the
other way round
i didnt think you
were going t o
marry me be-
cause i kissed
y o u - i kissed
you because  i
knew you were
going to marry
me

  coffee cigar-
ettes no one left except waiters discreetly
remote

   now lets see said peter frowning
 i ought to get a cable to-morrow wish
i knew if the old mans realiy going to boston
wednesday 

   peter how do you expect me to know
what youre talking about  


e	magazine

   its simple enough he said  youll
see itll work out one way or another
leave it to me

  all day tuesday there wasnt a word from
peter plenty from arthur though and lie
made the mistake of turning up at the flat
about seven-and she thought when she
heard the bell it was peter

  that was the end for arthur sally told
him as much of the truth as he could take in
and it was enough he walked out of her
life and she was glad of it then she sat up
till midnight waiting to hear from peter
but she never did

  wednesday morning it was her turn to be
up and dressed early and get coffee and
rolls for breakfast while she was doing
that the bell rang and this time it was peter
in plus fours and a cap

   hallo  he said  the old man went
to boston all right he frowned  that
dress wont do put on what you were
wearing saturday

   to go to the office  i wont peter you
are crazy 

   office  oh youre not going to the
office not to-day tell them youre ill
cars downstairs were going out to bal-
tamis breakfast on the way

  she looked at him oh what did anything
matter  they were going to fire her on
saturday anyway-they were sure to

  peter and sally had breakfast at the clare-
mont looking out over a misty river to the
palisades

   team match this afternoon you see lie
said  got to play the old mans all wet
need me-lots of bets on the darned match
got to give the boy friends a run for their
money he wont know-the old man being
in boston and theyre going to telephone
the cable from the office as soon as it comes
shed stopped expecting anything peter
said to make sense

  it was still early when they got to the club
and lunch on the clubhouse porch was nice
people were drifting in

   be quite a crowd peter explained
nothing in the papers though sort of
party we have every year with this hillway

gang lots of malefactors of great weatth
here-up there too bet their fool heads of
on this match silly if you ask me games
too much fun to mix it up with gambling
funny about the old man he bets as much
as any of them but itd be the gate for me
if he knew  was playing

   why take a chance then peter   said
sally

   oh i dont know sort of up to me
counting on me im not so hot now-
havent been playing enough no one else
carson couldnt eat for breakfast though
cant let the boy friends down

  sally was furious when she saw that most
of the crowd didnt mean to wait for peter
and his opponent carson who were the last
to start the first match got the gallery-
reasonably enough because the metropolitan
champion was playing for baltamis and a
man whod been runner-up twice in the
amateur was against him from hillway
only about half a dozen people made up the
gallery for peter and carson but she heard
one of them say the crowd would be around
for the finish all right because this was the
match that would settle things-if form meant
anything the other six twosomes would be
split

  nothing happened till the fourth hole
when peter finished one up

  no more excitement till the ninth wheu
peter was in trouble he was at the bottom
of a deep pit placed to penalise a sliced second
shot one way out was easy safe-and
costly for it entailed playing for the back of
the green and the practically certain loss of a
stroke sally and the rest of them stood
looking down as peter studied the lie of his
ball in the sand straight ahead was the high
bank of the pit

   gosh   said a man beside her  hes
going to try it 

  he did the niblick crashed down the
ball rose in a cloud of sand it soared high
cleared the bunker landed on the green
rolled on and on-until it lay directly between
carsons ball and the hole carson was
stymied hopelessly peters hole four to five
two up at the turn i
keep your eye on ike ball



 he fell hack to walls through the woods
 towards the tenth tee with sally

  youre marvellous  she said

you mean im shot with luck said
peter  wait a bit

 he hurried on to drive straight down the
 narrow tree-lined fairway went his ball
 sally vaguely conscious of a man who had
 fallen into step beside her turned with
 glowing cheeks

  wasnt that a splendid drive  she said
 the man was elderly and safe and saiiyd
 been quiet too long

  eh he said  oh yes  yes indeed
 he laughed harshly  good thing the boy
 can do something well maybe he can turn
 pro to make a living

 suspicion stirred suddenly in sallys mind
 she looked at this man again eyes-no
 nose-yes mouth and chin-oh yes he
 couldnt be though

 you- she said  oh ray soul-

 youre not-you cant be peters father 

  why not id like to know   said mr
 armstrong

 for that was exactly who he was

  because-oh because you went to boston
 for one thing  

  hmph said mr armstrong  but i
 didnt you see luckily know the yoimg
 idiot do you  

  yes-ves i do said sally  mr arm-
 strong-

  you have my sympathy he said
 wait shesaid please-couldnt we
 stay back a little so that peter wont see

you  itd be such a shock-

  i thought of that myself said mr
 armstrong grimly

 and increased his pace sally kept up
 with him  she wondered what would happen
 if she put out her loot anil tripped him they
 came to the green there were more people
 now carson putted from a corner lay dead
 for a five peter had a four-footer for the
 half he looked over saw sally and grinned
 then as he was about to turn and address
 the ball he saw his father the grin wa
 frozen into a grimace oi sheer horror for a
 moment he just stared then he missed his

 putt carsons hole peter was only one
 up

   grr  said mr armstrong  you see i
no concentration yellow thats what kg
is

   he is not  said sally furiously

  the eleventh was a nightmare peter dr
out of bounds-something he probably did
once every two years he pulled his second
drive into the rough picked up having
played six in a trap the match was square

  carson won the twelfth though peter pulled
himself together and stayed on the course
ruining himself this time with three putts

   what do you think now   said mt
armstrong grimly  i might overlook his
sneaking off because he thought i was ia
boston but seeing him quit-

  he ended with inarticulate growls sally
was shaken herself all her sympathy went
to peter-but oh he oughtnt just to let go
like this

  he was trying to look as if everything were
all right as if this were just what might hap-
pen to anyone but he didnt fool sally his
eyes gave him away he loathed himself
for being rattled for the way hed lost his
grip he knew right enough keep your
eye on the ball-the way hed said that to her
over and over but he-why it was just
because he didnt because he lifted his head
as he took an easy iron shot that he lost
the thirteenth hole-to make carson two up
and only five to go

  on the fourteenth peter over-approached
and the gallery shocked and incredulous-it
had grown to respectable proportions now-
saw carson sink- his putt to win the fifth liolo
in succession-and to be three up with four
to play

   well  said mr armstrong in sallys
ear  what do you think of him now  

  sally wished she had something to hit him
with

   ill tell you   she said  i think hell
win ill bet you he will ill bet you tea
dollars 

  she did have ten dollars-and about fifty
cents more and no job at least if she
still had a job the age of miracles wasnt past


e mow magazine

   ho  said mr armstrong  you need
a lesson ill take that bet young lady-only
ill give you ten to one

   no said sally  you wont i ought

to give you odds-

  peters father stared at her curiously she
didnt care what he thought

   all right he said and his voice some-
how was pleasanter  even money then
he held out his hand and reluctantly
sally shook it

  peter didnt lose the next hole but he
didnt win it either he couldnt very well
because though he played it perfectly so did
carson and now carson was dormie-three
up three to go

  they had to walk through the woods from
the fifteenth green to the next tee and sally
called to peter walking along his head down
a little ahead he turned and waited

   pine show youre putting on said sir
armstrong

   sorry sir it is pretty sour

   peter  said sally  i just bet your
father ten dollars youd win this match he
wanted to bet me ten to one you wouldnt
but i said i ought to give him odds not take
them peter

  he stared at her and she saw something
happen to his eyes and to his mouth

   you did he said  sally-

   dont say anything she cried  but--
oh peter-just keep your eye on the
ball

   i-all right i will he said but the
way he said it sent queer little thrills running
up and down sallys back he turned to his
father  thought you were going to boston
sir  change your mind 
 they postponed the meeting

   were you at the office   mr arm-
strong nodded curtly  did they happen to
say anything about a cable coming for
me

   yes said his father he took a blue
envelope from his pocket  want it  

  ill say i do  peters eyes were shining
eagerly he took the envelope tore it open
then he turned to sally  thats that  he
paid told you itd work out all right

hallo-got to beat it carsons waiting see
you later

  sally closed her eyes for a second as he
hurried off peter was back her own crazy
adorable peter this wasnt the peter whod
gone to pieces when he saw his father she
didnt see him drive but she heard the cheer
that broke out as the ball sailed down the
course and she saw carson outdriven for
the first time since peter had cracked peter
won the hole when he reached the green with
his brassie and sank a long putt for a birdie
nothing sensational about that three coming
just then though it bordered on the miracu-
lous

  peter still two down had the honour of the
next tee again he played perfect golf
carson unworried serene sure of winning
was earefui he took no chances peter had
to do just the same his second left him in
a tricky spot

  sally saw him shake his head he took a
deep-bladed mashio bit deep into the turf
the ball rose high in a lovely roaring flight
above the green it seemed to hover for a
moment then dropped like a hawk about to
strike a shout went up from the crowd the
ball had stuck two feet from the hole and lay
there motionless even sally no golfer
heaven knew could appreciate the magic of
that shot peters hole again-and carson
was one up with one to go 

   now  said sally to mr armstrong
 arent you ashamed of yourself  wasnt
that glorious  

   its not over yet said mr armstrong

  but every golfer in the gallery who knew
the eighteenth hole at baltamis thought it was
in his heart for that is a hole offering few
opportunities for the sort of golf that was all
that could save peter now you drive
straight out from the eighteenth tee for
your second you have to turn at right angles
to reach the green which you cant see from
the tee at all since woods hide it a strip
of maple oak and beech thirty or forty yards
wide two hundred yards from the tee

  peter stood on the tee studying the wind
then with a shake of his head he knelt and
built up a high tee of wet sand sally saw
keep your eye on the ball

s

he took  ten-dollar
bill from his pocket

 i dont want it
said sally but he made
her take it

carson start as peter look his stance she
heard a sort of whispered sigh that ran through
f he crowd then peter drove not down the
fairway but straight across the corner of the
woods a screaming drive that rose higher and
higher until the ball began to fall and the high
trees hid it

   by jimmy i think you made it  cried
carson in high and chivalrous excitement
and peter had he had risked utter disaster
should his ball fail to clear the woods he had
taken the one chance in a hundred that had
remained to him since carson playing safe
was morally sure of victory when after


e mew magazine

carson had made his clean orthodox drive
the first of the gallery went running down a
great cry came back peters ball was in
the open thirty yards short of the green
carsons on his second was only five yards
nearer peter laid his approach dead the
match was square and on the first extra
hole that was played peter won t
 hmph  said peters father pie looked
at sally curiously again he took a ten-dollar
bill from his pocket she grew scarlet

   i-oh i dont want it she said but
he made her take it peter saw that grinned
as he joined them

   oh peter  said sally and that was all
for the moment she could manage

   sorry i played

 oh thats all off sir  he said  mary
 and i-well thats been all wet thats why
 shes been staying abroad just to avoid me and

 -and-well theres sally you see and-

 he turned to sally

  that was the catch you see he said
 breathlessly that was why i laughed

 about your being
 engaged dad
 and marys dad
 had got us two
 kids engaged
 neither of us liked
 it so you and i
 sally couldnt be
 engaged until
 mary answered my
 cable and broke
 it off-dont you
 see  and she
 did-thats the
 cable i was wait-
 ing for-

 mr armstrong
 was making
 strange noises
 peter shook his
 head queer he
 seemed to feel
 how obtuse other-
 wise intelligent
 people were about
 some things

 si m p  e
 enough  he said
 just took a little
 concentration
 got to keep your
 eye on the ball
 thats all

the end
it had been my turn that morning to call	where henry and peter and i were taking an

for our letters at the post-office there	early fishing holiday on our own i nicked

was only one and that was for henry	henrys single miserable missive to him and

beturning to the small cottage by the river	told him it wasnt worth the journey
e miw magazine

   well t jolly well reckon it is  declared
henry pouncing on his letter  why its
from miss gorton theyve accepted
theyve accepted  he carolled blithely
 theyre coming to-day  theyll be here
in time for lunch  

   mr and mrs gorton   i asked

 and angela   added henry raptly
peter and i nodded sagely at each other
we had long suspected how it was with henry

  when did you invite them down i
inquired

  well ive written to-er-one or the
other of them about every other day the
whole fortnight weve been here replied
henry  begging them to run down and see
us and now she-i mean they-theyre
coming to-day 

   well what are we going to give them for
lunch   peter wanted to know

   times too short for anything in the way
of a really posh meal i pointed out  better
open an extra tin of bully beef and another
tin of pineapple chunks and let it go at that
i suppose

   do you seriously suggest witheringly
demanded henry  that we should offer an
ethereal creature like miss gorton bully beef
and tinned pineapple  

   well then put forward peter  what
about sardines  

   do your united imaginations soar no
higher than things in tins   asked henry
loftily

   oh well of course there are eggs said
peter brightly  if you think miss gorton
would like a few fried eggs and a rasher of

bacon or two-

   shut up   shouted henry  its sheer
profanity to couple mention of a divine girl
like miss gorton with-ugh -eggs and
bacon 

   well observed peter  as we dont
happen to have any ambrosial nectar or
candied rose-petals or angel-cake in the larder
at the moment id like to know what we
can offer them for lunch  

   you can leave it to me asserted henry
 ill step up into the village and see what i
can find worth having for lunch

  he was absent for nearly an hour when
he returned he was dangling a defunct lien

   roast chicken for dinner boys  he
proclaimed proudly  sheer inspiration
caught sight of this blighter and bought it
and had it slain straightway not every
camp that can give its visitors roast chicken
for lunch eh  

  and he put down the dead hen and stood
beside it with his arms folded as if he were
being photographed for a  my greatest
deed  series

  peter was the first to turn on the cold-
water tap

   my dear mr baxter he very politely
addressed henry  do you really imagine
that that bird can be cooked for to-days
lunch  

   dont you know that poultry has to hang
for a bit before its ready for cooking   i
asked  if we cook that bird to-day itll
be as tough as indiarubber

   oh dont be so jolly domesticated 
begged henry pettishly  besides i dont
believe it the old girl assured me that it was
quite young and would be as tender as
tender

   also my dear mr baxter continued
peter  may i point out that your purchase
has still to be plucked and that will take some
little while

   oh pooh as if we couldnt flip the
feathers off a fowl in three minutes between
us

   and how do you intend to cook the bird
i asked

   why roast it of course said henry
 one always roasts chickens doesnt one  

   but you priceless cuckoo remarked
peter  we havent got an oven-not one
that works the kitchen range here is pre-
historic

   i never thought of that  admitted
henry  oh well well boil the blessed
bird  

   our saucepan is much too small  i
pointed out

  very well then well grill it  snapped
henry  i decline to offer anything fried tc
miss gorton at all events and i do wish
 fowl luck 



you fellows wouldnt keep raising objections  
he protested u i think its most discouraging
of you however ive done my part thank
goodness and now its up to you two fellows 
 what t  chorussed peter and i

   well ive as it were designed the menu
and carried it all the way home contended
henry  surely its your turn to take over
now youve only got to get it plucked and
cooked and there you are  

   ind what about you   i asked

   oh im afraid i shall be a bit too busy
to give any further help said henry off-
handedly  by the time ive had a really
good shave and changed it will be quite time
for me to go off in the boat and meet the
gortons

   that isnt coming off  firmly asserted
peter  you brought the blessed fowl on
your own responsibility and youve got to
cook it 

   but ive got to go and meet---

   thats all rightsaid peter  i know
pa gorton and mrs gorton even better than
you do fu go and meet them

   dashed if you do   objected henry

   oh very well it you particularly want to
offer miss gorton tried eggs and bully-beef

and sardines for her lunch-

  well in the end henry very reluctantly
agreed to remain in the cottage to prepare
the fowl for lunch but it took a lot of
argument

  so peter began to get himself ready and
henry and  started to pluck the fowl

  i should never have believed there could be
so many feathers on a bird within three
minutes feathers were positively clogging the
air

   tell you what old man said henry
e this is going to be a long job pulling those
darn feathers off by hand why not burn em
off  im sure ive read somewhere about
fowls being singed

  it seemed to me that this was a good idea
so henry lighted the patent oil-stove and we
singed the fowl pretty thoroughly

  the experiment was not a complete success
apart from the awful aroma the result of our
efforts with the oil-stove was to give the fowl

a good deal of the aspect of a charred hedge
hg

   by jove   exclaimed henry slapping
his knee ive just thought of something
i remember reading the other day that an
awfully good way to cook a bird is to bury it
underground i mean you dig a hole and
shove the bird in feathers and all and then
you fill in the hole and light a fire on top
and then when you dig up the bird again it
comes out perfectly cooked and the feathers
and the skin just peel right off 

   good enough  quoth  and fetched a
spade

  henry was fearfully buckcd at having
recollected such a topping way to cook fowls

   itll do me a bit of good with miss gorton
he told me confidently  shell see how
domesticated i really am and how i can be
depended upon in an emergency and all that
sort of thing

  so he went into the small garden and glee-
fully shovelled out a hole for the hen and
buried it and we lighted a lire of paper and
twigs and rubbish on top

  peter was ready to start off in the boat by
then

   tell miss gorton that im hoping shell
enjoy chicken for lunch instructed henry
dont say any more just let it sound
mysterious and intriguing and all that

  peter went off and henry and i easied about
for a while

   i wonder how that fowl is getting on
mused henry at length  i mean theres no
chance of it being cremated right away to
ashes is there  or perhaps the fire isnt big
enough and the bird will be half-raw id just
hate to offer that girl raw fowl for her lunch
and id hate just as much to offer her a plate
of cinders dash it all im not going to risk
it im going to have a look  

  so he got the spade and cleared away the
fire then he prepared to exhume the bird

  it was a pity that in his nervousness he used
the spade so vigorously at the very first
thrust of the spade it plunged clean into the
earth

  i looked aghast at henry henry groaned
dismally
e mw magazine

  

  he had thrust his spade clean through the
centre of our projected lunch

  we brought the melancholy remains to the
light of day but we reburied them at once

   wheres the tin-opener i murmured

  s never s  exclaimed henry  i sent her
a message to the effect that there was chicken
for lunch and shell think i was only leg-
pulling if we trot out bully-beef and tinned
fruit i should hate her to think that  could
be guilty of a soulless
idiotic joke like that 

   well what are you
going to do  

   have another look
round the village  
asserted henry firmly

 if theres a cooked
chicken to be had any-
where within the five
mile radius im going to
get it if it costs me five
pounds or five years 

  again henry sallied
resolutely forth

  he was back quite soon
this time he positively
galloped back and he
was looking strangely
excited he had removed
his coat and was carrying
it in a bundle under his
arm

   oh i do believe in
fairies  he declared
ecstatically

   why whats hap-
pened   i asked

   ive managed to steal a cooked fowl 
explained henry with pride  in the bull
and crown it was you see i went along there
to see if old jephson the landlord could do
anything for us in the matter  knew it was
no good asking mrs jephson because some-
how she doesnt like me one little bit but
when i got there old jephson had gone out
for the day so i had to ask mrs jephson if
shed got such a thing as a cooked fowl
knocking about the place i told her how
badly we wanted one she seemed very

pleased to learn that i was badly in need o
anything

   what happened 

   she said she did happen to have a roast
fowl in the place she had iust finished cook-
ing it for a couple of chaps who are going back
there to lunch  asked her to sell me the
fowl but she only laughed she wouldnt sell
it to me at any price  

   well then how did you get it 

  well i wab already coming away when
some instinct-i think my guardian angel
must nave put it into my head-prompted me
to turn back and have another shot to get
that bird but this time i went round to the
back of the place  guessed shed be in the
kitchen and its a longish way from the
kitchen to the bar and you know how women
hate being called away from their work

   so you went to the back door  

   i did i knocked no answer i peeped
into the scullery no one there except
fowl luck



that deaf old servant woman then i spotted
the fowl on a dish been put there to get
cold in time for lunch i daresay well i
simply swooped in one half-second i had
my blazer off and in another i had the
fowl well and truly wrapped up in it then
i sprinted like biily-o and here i am  he
vaunted  and heres roast fowl for lunch
after all 

   jolly risky  i commented

   pooh thatll be all right old jephson

and i are great pals and ill explain to
him some time and square up for the bird
and hell see that the whole thing blows
over

  i think you said your guardian angel
interested itself in procuring that fowl for
you   i remarked  well it seems to me
that your guardian angel had better prepare

to get busy again look whos coming along
the bank 

  henry looked

   gosh   he said in blank dismay

  hurriedly henry deposited his coat-wrap-
ped plunder within the cottage then with
pitiful attempts at unconcern we turned to
greet the local policeman

   my word you got a good few feathers
blowing about ere he observed quite
genially t birs jephson was saying something

to me about just
aving ad a fowl
stole but i
shouldnt think
from all these
feathers as you
gents is short
enough of fowls to
ave to steal one
i reckon it was a
cat and so i told
er

  the policeman
sat down and filled
his pipe we sat
down beside him
the policeman had
his dog with him
and we made a
fearful lot of
fuss of the dog
somehow we
felt it would do
us no harm to
keep on the right
side of the police-
man

   no i reckon
it was a cat right
enough as ad
m r s jephsons
fowl declared the constable presently

   we havent had a fowl in the cottage all
the time weve been here stated henry
quite priggishly  so mrs jephson wouldnt
find her bird here anyway

   but i thought i saw you carrying a fowl
this mornin  mentioned our visitor

   that   said henry  oh yes that 


oh we-we buried that of course its-
its a new way he hastened to add in re-
sponse to the constables surprised stare
a new way of-of keeping them from
getting high

   ah yes said the constable easily
e lots of new-fangled ideas about now dont
know as theyre any better than the old
ones though when alls said and done

  he proceeded to develop a discussion on
the subject of new ideas and old in the
middle of his talk his dog got up and wan-
dered away

  i was pretending an extraordinary interest
in the constables theory when presently i
caught a glimpse of the dog through the cot-
tage door it was eagerly nosing henrys
joat

  henry and i exchanged agonised glances
fortunately the policemans back was to-
wards the cottage

  i got up to drive the dog out but i sat
down again i had a vision of the dog rushing
out with mrs jephsons fowl in its jaws
and we didnt want that to happen

  presently we heard ominous crackings

   wheres that dog o mine   said the
policeman  i ope e aint up to no mischief
hes chewing a branch or something
declared henry desperately

  sounds as if es in your cottage ill
soon ave im out e might start eating
your food or something

   no dont bother  implored henry
 hes quite all right where he is he-hell
keep the rats away  

   he aint got no business in a private
place maintained the policeman and half-
turned to call his dog

   why es eating something already 
exclaimed our visitor  ere rover  

its-its quite all right  averred henry
 really it is hes only finishing up some odd

the

magazine

scraps we left about on purpose if he called-

i mean if a dog came

  ah but i dont allow jim to eat except
at proper times said the policeman rising
 and if e wont come when es called i
must go and fetch im out and teach im better
thats all 

  he strode towards the cottage

   look   exclaimed henry wildly pointing
towards a distant hedge  theres a cat gone
along there and ill swear its got something
in its mouth looked just like a roast fowl
to me oh do lets go and see  he cried
grasping our visitor by one arm and beginning
to drag him away

  i grabbed the other arm and between us
we hauled the surprised policeman across to
the hedge

  we hunted for some while but no cat did
we espy when at last we returned cottage-
wards the dog was sitting out on the bank
it had a contented look in its eye

   well time i was getting along said the
policeman  come along rover ill attend
to you later on when we get back to the
whip

  he saluted us very amicably and trudged
off henry and i darted into the cottage a
few splintered bones were all that was left
of the roast fowl

  and as ilenry tottered out into the open
peter came sculling round the bend with our
guests

  i picked up the tin opener

  a couple of minutes later our guests were
with us

   i got your message mr baxter said
miss gorton brightly i do you know i
think you must be an awfully clever man mr
baxter however did you guess we were
bringing along a pair of cold chickens and
some other things in the luncheon-basket as a
little surprise  

end

              -

at beauty i am not a star

there are others mere handsome by far

but my face i dont mind it for i am behind it
the fellows in front get the jar
romance for rent

                     continued from page 

one of these for an hour or so   said chester
in his earnest young way

   surely not said miss mooney  awfully
smart dont you think  and hardly costs
anything to make

i hope youll be
able to push them
it will be a profit-
able line one
moment ill get
you a box

  so half an hour
later when chester
walked into the
cubby-hole where
miss kenyon had
her desk he was
carrying a gedding
hat-box in his
hand he gave her
a serious smile and
closed the door
behind him

   i have a new
hat here he said
untying the string

 the iatest from
paris and ive
brought it over-er
-to get your views
on it

  from his fifth
word she might
have posed for the
spirit of attention
and by the time he
had the box open
she had produced
a mirror from the

m ms a jooetlr dausmr
       and

ohqoy hovjhe tried him

lower drawer of her desk and had twice
rearranged her hair

    oh isnt it cute   she cried as chester
lifted the hat from the box

    no title there
he thought after a
moments hesita-
tion

  she put it on
and did something
precious with the
hang of her small
ear-rings

    isnt it a dar-
ling she ex-
claimed then

   no title there
muttered chester
to himself

  you wouldnt
have to tell any-
body its the
latest 

    no title there
he muttered again
after a moments
thought

    its the queer-
est thing about
styles she con-
tinued the
moment you put
on the new one it
makes all the
others look old
there cried
chester to himself
in frowning young


magazine

triumph eit makes all the others look
old

   i wish id been wearing this the other
night she went on doing various tricks
with the mirror  just to see em stare
again chester had an inspiration

   are you busy to-night  he asked
no she said apparently looking at
the back of her head

   then could i engage you  

  why i dont mind she said and
hurried out to show the other girls

  chester immediately phoned miss mooney
 that new hat he said  im getting
opinions on it favourable so far but do
you mind if-er-one of my business associates
wears it this evening so that i may get
views in a wider field  thank you very
much miss mooney yes ill make a com-
plete report

y

old john liked the millinery circular too
sounds like good stuff to me he
said  but the proof of the pudding
is whether it sells the goods well try it
out and ill tell you what ive been think-
ing if we get results from the stockings
and hats there may be an opening for you
here a steady job for a year or two would
do you good-give you a chance to find your
bearings and all that six pounds a week
say to start you neednt say any tiling
now but keep it in the back of your head
and think it over

   six pounds a week  scoffed chester
to himself  when ill soon be making that
much a day 

   and now if you want to try another
continued old john  weve just received a
shipment of cubist dancing-shoes either for
dancing or evening wear go up and see
mr merry in the shoe department and tell
him i sent you and why

   avill he let me take a sample pair  
asked chester and seeing that the older
man was beetling his brows at the question
he explained in his serious young way 
 miss rooney gave me a sample hat and i

think i told you that a young lady helped
me with the stockings-at so much for the
evening you understand well she helped
me with the hat too  paid her for wearing
it last night and this circular is based upon her
own reactions and also upon the reactions
which we received from other women when
they looked at it so i thought now if i
could arrange for her to wear a pair of these

new shoes-

old john exclaimed  sssrrrumph again
preparatory to blowing his nose  i see
ril have to be careful what hues i give you
he added  lucky were not selling diamonds	

or motor-cars all light ill phone mr

merry but youd better get her right size

they were charming little shoes of mosaic
leather work each tiny piece of leather a
different pastel shade and these pieces
sewed together as though by a graduate
artist in patch-work quilts a cubist design
as chester had been told and when you hear
that the colours were lilac and pink and rose
and grey and here and there a bold bit of
purple and black you will imderstand how
gladly he phoned miss kenyon and asked her
the size of her shoes

 twos she answered in a voice of slight
wonder

pie told her why he had asked her but
site didnt seem to be particularly enthu-
siastic

 and can i engage you for this evening  
he asked

 im afraid not-this evening she said

 why not   he asked

she chided him by a short pause and then
answered	-i

 i have another engagement

 to-morrow evening then   he asked

this time her pause was somewhat longer

 i think youd better call up to-morrow
she said  i may be too tired

he took the shoes-twos an unusually
pretty pair-and when he left the store
he stood in the entrance for nearly a nnnute
with the package under his arm

 i know what ill do he suddenly told
himself  ill go and show em to her
romance for rent



i may get an idea for a title-if nothing else so hes
if you had been there when he walked says he
into miss ken-
yons cubby-
hole ten minutes
later it might
have occurred
to you that she
looked up at him
with an indiffer-
ent eye b ut
that when he
opened his pack-
age her glance
not only bright-
ened b u t her
mouth seemed
to water as well

   arent they
beauties she
exclaimed

   i wish youd
break that other
engagement and
wear them to-
night sa-d
chester ear-
nestly

   i cant she
said you
k n o w - i t  s
funny in a way

while ive been
helping you get
ideas you gave
me an awfully
good one mr

smollet saw us
out together the
other evening-

i do a lot of
work for him-
and when he
began teasing
me  told him 
was oniy hired
for the evening
-that every-
thing was
strictly business

 lady   excuse me conductor but do you pass
 the grand theatre

 conductor  yes mam

 lady  then perhaps you could tell me the programme
 that will be there this evening

engaged me for this evening and he
can get me a lot of business ive
been talking to

some ot the
other girls and
theyre quite
keen for it too
so if you find
me missing here
some day youll
know ive
started an
agency of my
ownwhy not 

   chester didnt
think much of
it

  whos mr
smollet   he
asked doyou
know him well
enough i 

     knew him
long before i
knew you she
smiled  hes
in the estate
b usiness -
awfully clever-
and makes a lot
ol money

    but you can
give me to-
morrow night
said chester

  id rather
not promise
she hesitated
 i dont know
yet how long i
shall be up to-
night but if
youll call me

t o  morrow--

and i think
youd better
take these
heavenly slip-
pers she added
with something


he jjqsisr fflagazm

like a sigh or i might be tempted to
wear them

   oh well frowned chester leaving the
building a few minutes later with his package
under his arm  ill be able to do a good
nights work this evening-

  but though he sat up in his boarding-
house room till after twelve-one heavenly
slipper on each side of his ink-bottle-the
net results of his work were four heavily
corrected sheets of copy paper-four sheets
of paper which he sourly tore up the following
morning after reading them

   ill have miss kenyon write a few letters
for me he told himself wrapping up the
slippers  ive been neglecting my corre-
spondence too much lately

  so at half-past nine he walked into her
cubicle with his package again under his
arm and found her just taking her hat off
of course it might have been imagination
but it seemed to chester that she looked
diflerent-that there was more colour in her
cheeks more vivacity in her manner than
he had ever seen before he was still waiting
for her to get her notebook when a long-
nosed man with a little black moustache
looked in-a long-nosed man with a very
able look even though his smile at that
moment might best be described as killing

   good-morning mr smollet said miss
kenyon and handed him a number of letters
which she had evidently written the previous
afternoon

   ill see you again-when you are dis-
engaged he said lisping a little

  chester shut the door as soon as he could
and dictated four letters-the first one
frowningly the next two sadly and the
fourth with a wistful note in his voice

   and now about this evening   he
asked reaching for the slippers

  no not this evening to be perfectly
frank im much too tired she told him

   then to-morrow evening said chester

  but im engaged for to-morrow night

  m with smollet again   he asked return-
ing to his frowns

   thats not fair she said beginning to
frown herself  a lawyer for instance

doesnt discuss one client with another so
why should i-with you  

  chester left a few minutes later his package
still under his arm his ears almost as red as
his hair and turning at the entrance per-
haps for a last reproachful glance he saw
smollet eagerly advancing toward miss ken-
yons door at this-as the novelists say-
the iron entered chesters soul

   oh well he thought  there are plenty
of other places where i can have my type-
writing done i shall never come here again 
but he did for one thing you see he
had forgotten those four letters and for
another he had grown accustomed to miss
kenyon and the efficient manner in which
she took his dictation and after all their
relationship had only been based upon the
strictest business principles she had a
perfect right to go out with smollet or anyone
else she chose

   im awfully pleased to hear you say
that she said to chester  because you
know i was beginning to think you were
unfair

  and when can you give me another
evening   he asked

  she gave him the next wednesday-and
the next-until at last he had four wednesday
evenings in a row-and always when he took
her home he reached in his pocket for the
envelope which he had placed there and
solemnly handed over her fee on the last
of these meetings they had dined at the
rochambeau roof and while they were
exercising in their first dance chester noticed
that miss kenyon was looking carefully
around among the tables

   i know he said-though he didnt know
how his lip was curling- this is where
smollet saw us  the first time we went out
together youre wondering if hes here
to-night

   you know that isnt nice she said

   it may not be nice he told her in low
voice you understand because of the others
who were taking exercise around them but
i think somebody ought to talk to you about
smollet personally i dont think hes to be
trusted
romance for rent



   t do she said  and so would you if
i told you something

   tell me then he challenged her  i
hate to misjudge people

  she looked up at him her eyelashes never
seeming so long nor the cleft in her chin so
deep

   he wants me to marry him she said
and gently lowered her head again

  chester probably swallowed harder than
he had ever swallowed before in his life

   are you going to   he asked when he
had finally brought his adams apple to rest

   you know what i told you once she
reminded him

   good for you   he exclaimed and put
so much pep in his dancing that they bumped
three couples in quick succession

   do you call that strictly business   she
asked raising her eyes again

  it wasnt of course but neither was the
evening-being one of those balmy may
nights when plum trees are in blossom and a
wise old maid will shut her ears if she hears
the  blue danube chester had meant to
take miss kenyon to a show  but somehow
when they descended from the rochambeau
roof they took a bus instead and continued
their exercise by a walk in hyde park
about them was the subdued purr of the
city at play and all around were other
couples either seated on benches or strolling
side by side here and there the grass had
been cut that day-its fragrance as sweet as
the song of any birds

   how are your circulars for geddings
going on   she asked him once

   the stockings and millinery are doing
well he said   think well pay for those
but the shoe circular-mr gedding didnt
like it

  he didnt add and she didnt remind him
that in his pique against smoilet he had
written the shoe circular without any help
from her but he thought of it

  and still they moved slowly along among
those other couples-some of them driltmg
along together in silence like figures dimiv seen
in dreams

   i dont know- chester found himself

thinking  i guess theyre more important
than i thought turning this reflection
over the words of old john arose in ilia
mind in our business you know we
must understand the sadies or we wouldnt
be able to please them

  when he gave miss kenyon her fee that
night he sighed to himself and walked slowly
to his boarding-house

   like a cross-word puzzle-maybe- he

found himself thinking asam  you cant
solve it just by looking and wondering no
matter how close it is you-youve got to
get pencil and paper and-and get right
down to work

vi

the next day miss kenyon wasnt at the
office the day after that chester
was informed she had a cold and
on the third day they told him that her cold
was threatening to turn into pneumonia 

   poor girl she isnt as strong as she looks
said miss gluck  im going over to see
her this afternoon

  chester didnt wait till afternoon he
paused long enough to get a dozen scarlet
roses and then he hurried to the flats where
she lived-a queer smarting in his nose a
funny aching in his throat as though he too
was sickening tor something arriving at
her address and sending up his name he was
presently admitted bv a pleasant-taced
matron who smiled as though she had heard
of him more than once and a few minutes
later lie was shown into miss kenyons room
it was a charming room indeed for that
matter the whole flat had secretly impressed
chester in this room in which he now
found himseli for instance the walls were
covered by japanese paper the floor with a
silky rug by the window was a desk and
over the desk a time-mellowed painting of a
red-taced old boy with a white starched
choker around his neck the furniture was
walnut the counterpane embroidered silk
and from under this counterpane a long-
eyelashed young lady smiled up at chester and
welcomed him in a hoarse whisper

   i cant talk out loud she told him


flfte motsf

i always get this silly laryngitis when i
have a cold

   her mother came in with the roses then-
roses which were greeted with a hoarse cry of
rapture

    theyre fannys favourite flowers said
mrs kenyon you couldnt have brought
her anything to please her more

  chester stopped about ten minutes and
when he arose to go fanny hoarsely
whispered  wait a minute and reaching
into a drawer of a table by the side of her
bed she brought out an envelope and handed
it to him

    whats this   asked chester beginning
to feel warm

    your fee she told him with a hoarse
young bark of satisfaction

   my what 

   your fee  she crowed t your
six-and-eightpence for coming everything
strictly business-the way we agreed

    i dont want your six-and-eightpence
he told her wiping his forehead

    but youve got to take it she firmly
barked  i always took it and if you
dont take it
you cant come
again

  so chester
took it and the
next day he took
his second fee-
his ears playing
their old trick of
trying to match
his hair-but on
his third visit
he couldnt go
into the bed-
room but stayed
in the living-
room and once
when mrs ken-
yon came out
for a minute
and he saw she
was crying

chester nearly
wept with her-

 wivs go through such a lot

magazinz

and later peeled potatoes for the nurses
dinner

  by sunday though he had the entree of
the bedroom again fannys eyelashes were
as long as ever and the cleft in her chin was
as deep but it only needed a glance to see
how near she had been to solving a certain
great mystery

   i think theres one more fee in the
drawer she said at once

   i dont want any more fees he gently
scoffed  i want you

  you mean-to fire me again  

   no i mean to own you for good
somehow by that time he was kneeling
by the side of the bed her hand in his

   mr gedding offered me six pounds a week
and a steady job the other day he said
 do you think we could get along on that  
she nodded with a far-away smile-the
smile of those who are happy in their dreams-
and then she laughed

   do you remember that first night you
hired me   she asked  and i said love
was a trap and a sickness-and you said
women were germs-and took all a mans

time and

money  
chester
snorted

   i guess we
were younger
then he said
 folk have to
live and learn
and dismissing
these juvenile
errors with a
wave of his
hand he con-
tinued in a more
serious tone
 bring those
cubist shoes
around to-mor-
row an extra
fifteen pounds
would come in
handy now
