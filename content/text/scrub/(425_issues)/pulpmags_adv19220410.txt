how to do things successfully

the first requisite for success the one thing above all else which is	--

 necessary for success is to have the faith belief and confidence in
 your ability to succeed

 you may have every other requirement necessary-education experience
 special training but unless you have this faith belief and confidence
 in your ability to succeed you will fail nothing else is possible
 under the universal law you use

 this faith belief and confidence may be something you have known
 and realized or you may not even have suspected its presence but it
 must be there or success will not come to you you know this is true

 you may have thought at times success was only bestowed by some
 blind goddess of luck who either forgot or overlooked you but deep
 down in your heart and soul you knew better

 you know whenever this faith belief and confidence possessed your
 soul you always succeeded and whenever it did not you always
 failed either wholly or partially

 many persons start a thing in the belief it the thing not themselves will
 succeed and carry them on to success with it but they usually find so
 many impossibles in their pathway that they get cold feet and quit

 you know this is true for everyone has had similar experiences of
 some kind

 the real solution of how to do things successfully lies in learning

how to create this consciousness this feeling of faith belief and con-	-

 fidence in your ability to win success and

 create it so strong powerful and lasting that no matter what impossibles you may encounter you will hold
 your faith belief and confidence in your abilityto master them and so win your success in everything you desire

 the creating of such a consciousness feeling and faith based on reason logic equity justice and harmony-not
 the blind faith of the ignorant and undeveloped soul but the faith which is based on an intelligent knowledge of
 and practical experience in the use of universal laws-is one of the things taught by the sears philosophy founded
 by that master psychologist and worlds greatest psycho-analyst and psycho-synthesis expert dr f w sears

 that this can and it being done daily is testified to and evidenced by the thousands of sears philosophy students all over the world

 the sears philosophy messenger contains full particulars as what to do in order to create such a consciousness feeling and faith

   editors note-in  we published brethren of the beach a
novelette by h d couzens before he died mr couzens was asked by a
book publisher to enlarge this story to book size always a conscientious
workman he found that to increase its length beyond a certain mark weak-
ened the story and he could not bring himself to do that he was making
his long game fight against slow disease and the money from book publica-
tion and the satisfaction of seeing his work in book form would have meant
a great deal to him but he was too much a man and too much an artist to
prostitute his work and he lost the chance of book publication

   he amplified the plot and increased the length by more than half this
much he felt he could do without loss to the story and possibly with gain

he would not go further recently mrs couzens asked us whether we
cared to buy the enlarged version of the story a decade had passed since
the original novelette appeared in our pages many of our readers have
never seen it and the old-timers will bear out our feeling that its immense
popularity fully warrants our printing it in enlarged form

  adventure

  captain wiggins was a grizzled bearded
veteran of years of buffeting by pacific
seas-a dull uninteresting man whose
thoughts ran in pounds and pence and who
smoked a black tobacco that it was best to
keep on your lee side to him a fortuitous
voyage meant merely so many pounds
sterling that was his sole interest in the
matter

  the wonders of the deep and the inter-
est of the polyglot traffic of the south seas
meant nothing to him unless they could be
reduced by a coinage table into sound
english money if there were any gems in
the dross of his tedious recitals they ap-
peared by accident as the kanaka passed
he muttered-

  there goes a boy who lost me a fortune
  who is he some one asked

  my second mate hes seen a heap of
things joey as but e never talks queer
trait for a kanaka thats why i keep im
with me es loyal to the chap as done me
but some day mebbe is tongue will loosen
and then im thinkin ill square accounts
and he shook his huge hairy fist at the
disappearing trio

  this seemed promising and on the ve-
randa the captain was pressed for partic-
ulars he lighted one of his vile cheroots
crossed one fat leg over the other-not with-
out some grunting effort-and in his usual
rambling fashion continued

  yes-lost me a fortune joey did all
by not tellin me is employer the ole truth
i dont know ow much i never could find
out some day ill get at is weak point-
drink mebbe or e may get badly urt-and
then ell talk and ill go after matthews
again

  i ad the charter for workin a guano
island away up north of the line i picked
up six kanakas and six white bummers
whod been ordered off the beach-that is
five of em ad the other was a gentleman
born-son of a viscount e was-sickly sort
of chap who forced imself on me as you
may say and what e wanted on a job o
that kind beats me to this day

  it did for im in the end i know that
im bound to say too that this matthews
turned out to be a very decent chap for an
american anyway there they all were
twelve of em white and dark when i put
in there later ten of em ad disappeared off
the face of the earth leavin matthews and
this kanaka boy the sole survivors i was

payin em all good wages and of course
i was just that much in pocket though i
should by rights ave been in a good deal
more

  another thing there was a chap as ad
tried for the charter along with me who put
in at that island to make my men trouble
e disappeared together with several of is
crew and the rest reported im murdered
when they got to sydney matthews ac-
counted for it all by a story of a fight with
this man and then the small-pox that wiped
them all out

   i believed it till i eard a little later
that matthews was rich and then i run
across this boy joey again es rich too
for a kanaka and keeps is money-
another queer thing

  now i leave it to you isnt it fishy
eres a man bummin the beaches for years
who quits a job at twenty pound a month
a rich man and the kanaka with im too
over a dozen ave been polished off some-
ow most mysterious and there you are
i thought mebbe they ad been bleedin
effingams people till i eard talk of pearls

  then i unted up matthews in the
states and put it to im plain-wasted
a matter o three months i did at consider-
able expense i put it to im as plain as
i am to you but of course it was more or
less of a bluff my story wouldnt ave
eld water matthews laughed in my face
then e wrote me a check for two undred
pounds-a thousand dollars gold that is-
american money told me to march and
consider myself a lucky man

  i ask you-if e was willin to give me
that much when e didnt ave to-if the
ole stake mustnt ave been enormous
of course i made a good thing out of the
guano-the plantations were fair cryin for
fertilizer-but it was my island wasnt it
if i can find out what actually appened-
and in my mind it was a angin matter-
ill make matthews sing to a different tune

  in this disconnected fashion wiggins told
all he knew of the story one of the listen-
ers was deeply interested for he had known
tom matthews he had in fact been one
of the ill-starred party on the yacht that
left her bones among the herveys

  but the tale was incomplete there were
maddening gaps that the captain could not
fill as if it were a picture puzzle of which
the key-scrolls were missing

  the captain fancied he had a grievance
brethren of the beach i



that touched his tenderest place-his pock-
et-and his sole interest was to acquire
material for discreet blackmail beyond
that he could supply only meager and unim-
portant facts and joey the gilbert island
boy when approached later sustained the
reputation the captain had given him for
reticence

  there had been a fight then men had
died swiftly of small-pox and that was the
end of the matter the boy shuddered with
distress as he told it if matthews had
chosen to give him money that was his
business matthews was his good flem
friend

  that was many years ago and as time
went on there came from various island
sources other bits which while they added
to the bulk of information only threw the
picture scrolls into greater confusion some-
thing of effinghams tragic life was heard in
the orient and something of the part played
by frawley but it did not explain why
effingham had buried himself and was
literally buried on a guano island

  it did not account for matthews sudden
wealth nor the disappearance of frawley
the story told by the survivors of frawleys
schooner was incomplete and baffling and
once the official inquiry was over they had
fled in all directions

chapter i

at low ebb

on an afternoon of tropical mid-
summer five men sat at a saloon
table in suva the sun beat
mercilessly on the roof of galvan-
ized iron all of suva that remained in-
doors sweltered under the corrugated metal
roofs the most absurd covering imaginable
for tropical latitudes the shabby palms
drowsed and nodded in the heat and solid
objects were vague and unstable of outline

  the five men gulped gin and soda
thirstily and between drinks talked low
and earnestly their heads together over the
table often glancing furtively about with
unfriendly suspicion at the few loungers
none of whom paid them the least attention
beyond a bare glance of somewhat scornful
curiosity

  in appearance the group was seedy to
the last degree the men had reached

  then one day the listener came across
tom matthews and his wife in honolulu and
put half a dozen questions because of the
bond between them these were answered by
matthews and lo the picture was complete
the key-scrolls fitted exactly into place
it was a grim picture of greed and passion
on the most desolate of island beaches with
a touch here and there of rather fine
heroism

  matthews eventually told the tale with
all the finer details he laughed at wiggins
story

  of course i provided for joey said he
and took good care to tie his money up for
him so that he can only get at the interest
without my consent otherwise he would
have been rooked out of it in no time as
for wiggins perhaps the old chap may not
think so but he got more than he was en-
titled to the shell was found before he had
the charter if any one had a claim on the
pearls it was the british government but
if i had told wiggins and offered to share
with him he would have taken them all
claiming liis right under the charter the
guano alone made him a fortune and far
too dear a price had been paid for those
pearls for them to slip into his well-lined
pockets

  and the listener agreed with him

their lowest estate-the inroads of life on
the open beach being plainly visible they
were moreover of the strange incongruous
ill-assortment that can be found only in the
south pacific

  chance and common misfortune had
brought them together in the first place
yet aside from the desire for food and
drink-especially drink-they were utterly
without congeniality

  welsh the orange-haired giant an im-
posing and formidable figure had been a
bushranger in australia and served time at
port jackson douchet small black-
bearded and shifty-eyed was a french
anarchist late of noumea the government
prison of new caledonia davison loose-
lipped flabby of jaw and grossly sensual
was a remittance-man and cox a quiet
rat of a man whom davison alternately
bullied and patronized was of the same
invertebrate branch of the tribe of ishmael
the two had been cronies in a way for
years but it was a friendship founded on


adventure

shiftlessness and sheer dread of loneliness
and a poor thing at best

  these four were incompetents-incapa-
bles-typical riffraff of the beach

  the fifth man was tom matthews an
american who still retained something of
his heritage of lithe muscles the address
of a gentleman and in spite of features
seamed with dissipation and weather a
pair of eyes clear and unwaveringly honest
his face might have been a trifle stronger
the eyes a little less wistful and introspec-
tive  and that they were not may be taken
in some degree at least as a reason for his
presence in the company

  they were at the moment drinking up
the last of coxs small quarterly remittance
beyond that they were at the end of their
resources severally and collectively they
had been warned that fiji was a british
colony smugly respectable and that they
were a menace to law and order and the
peace of mind of the community

  the warning rankled and successive
drinks had brought them to the stage of
recklessness and scorn of authority that
in hopeless and broken men may become
dangerous they were talking somewhat
incoherently of desperate measures and
with welsh and douchet to whom violence
and crime had been an essential part of
existence there was more in the talk than
mere drunken boasting

  welsh knew of a boat that might be
stolen-a large sailing-canoe with this
as a beginning armed and provisioned
they might forcibly acquire larger and bet-
ter boats by progression until they were
able to seize a schooner

  why not hayes had done it so had
other men they could name

  then there were traders at lonely stations
in the poisonous solomons or the new
hebrides who could be robbed with ease
and impunity there were ways and means
that required no more than the taking of a
sporting chance

  matthews listened silently and with a
growing bitterness in his present evil
case he had found the company of these
men all as wretched as himself a comfort
for man is a gregarious animal but there
were times when his gorge rose at them
in disgust

  he balked at theft and murder life
had gone hard with him of late but he had
not yet come to that he was still able

he assured himself to face the wholesome
sunrise with a fairly clean conscience
though his self-respect was not what it had
once been

  four years before while on a visit to
california he had made one of a yachting-
party that started merrily and irrespon-
sibly from san francisco for a cruise
through the south seas at sydney he
was to take a steamer back to california
while the yacht continued around the world
he had written the girl back east about it
and they were to be married when he re-
turned

  but the yachting-party was composed of
hare-brained spirits who devoted their ener-
gies to draw-poker and strong drink at
honolulu their stay was only an elabora-
tion of the rioting aboard and even the
easy morality of the beaches farther south
was shocked by the conduct of these wild
young men

  that sort of thing is naturally bad for
discipline aboard a yacht and had its effect
on the officers and crew the owner of the
yacht who acted as his own sailing-master
was the most reckless spirit aboard and
the disorder spread even to the forecastle
with the result that the yacht was wrecked
among the herveys with the loss of several
lives nearly every soul aboard being drunk
at the time

  the survivors were eventually rescued
and went their several ways disappearing
with something of an air of mystery-a
very much chastened party of young men
tom finally got to honolulu where he wrote
the girl telling what had happened and
saying that he was going home immediately
after a brief rest ashore

  but bad news has a way of traveling
fast most of the young men were of rich
and important families and certain things
had appeared in the papers about the
yachting-party and its ways at honolulu
and in time there came a letter from the
girl-whose views on some subjects were
rather pronounced--the burden of which
was that she would never marry an irrespon-
sible boy without one of the virtues of man-
hood and a drunkard to boot it was a
very scathing letter and effectually put an
end to toms hopes and he loved the
girl very much

  the worst of it was that tom was in no
way to blame for the yachts disastrous
trip he had been disgusted with the state
brethren of the beach



of affairs aboard from the first had tried
to keep a clear head remonstrated with his
companions and as is usual in such cases
brought dislike and partial ostracism on
himself in consequence

  in the final disaster he had shown a fine
courage that amounted to heroism but an
explanation to the girl that he was not
what she thought would have had the
appearance of an attempt to whitewash
himself at the expense of his companions
two of whom had perished in the wreck
and he was therefore left quite defense-
less

  having considerable money tom re-
mained in honolulu and plunged despair-
ingly into a course of wildness that rivaled
that of the late yachting-party this lasted
for some time when his money was nearly
gone he sent for more only to find that
through certain intricate speculations of
his trustees there was no more to be
had

  he then decided that there was nothing
left for him at home and with the remnant
of his funds took passage on a schooner
bound for the south seas at first he made
an effort to keep straight and do something
worth while he took up such small em-
ployments as he could find but a man with-
out money is as badly off among the islands
as a man without money anywhere else
except that going to the dogs is a great deal
easier where the conventionalities are less
finely drawn and one has plenty of com-
pany 

  tom worried more than was good for
him over the way the girl had treated him
and little by little he began to lose hold
it is the strong bronzed men ruthless
full of initiative and lacking in conscientious
scruples who draw the few prizes among
islands tom was of milder stuff the
months and years went by and found him
an idler simply drifting through sheer
inability to apply himself a prey to morbid
loneliness

  he had tried petty clerkships had sailed
before the mast and set up as a trader
and in all he had failed his natural inde-
pendence found clerking under the british
system only less obnoxious than the fore-
castle of rancid beetle- and roach-infested
copra-schooners

  as a trader he found pleasure in the rain-
bow-spanned valleys the splendid sunsets
the brown fishers on the reef and the ever-

changing pictures painted with the raw
pigments of the tropics but the loneliness
was appalling and as he was totally lacking
in the commercial instinct the natives
cheated him shamelessly

  he never became reconciled to the mere-
tricious sham of island life and it was with
him as it is with some an easy drift into
oblivion but aside from this his subse-
quent career differed in no way from that
of many others who have been spewed up
upon the beaches

  he found that his self-respect which he
had always cherished as above price was
no great asset after all he learned to
sponge for drinks as shamelessly as the
oldest blue-nosed bummer on the beach
and to take pot-luck with the natives
when nothing better served without a
qualm

  he was not depraved or besotted it
was simply a matter of necessity on finding
himself for the first time in his life in the
need of the wherewithal to keep body and
soul together

  he made friends where he found them
chiefly among remittance-men or men with
shady pasts he had nothing to look for-
ward to and nothing particularly creditable
to look back upon but it is probable that
he retained more of the rags of his self-
respect than he knew he was a beach-
comber a loafer and an outcast but not a
complacent one

  he might have ended as many have a
contented lotus-eater with a dusky female
provider but he despised the squaw-men
of the beaches fatuously content with their
families of half-caste children as he did the
dull simple traders hoarding away savings
against days of ease back home he
earned a dollar where he could and crav-
ing excitement promptly spent it among
his chosen friends

  four years of this aimlessness had brought
him to the end of his tether with the sick-
ening realization that he had thrown away
the best years of his life to return home
a penniless failure with the stigma of the
wrecked yacht upon him was not to be
thought of the warning he and his com-
panions had received had touched the last
raw quivering nerve of his latent pride so
that it was with a sense of shame and
humiliation that he gulped down gin in the
saloon and listened to the atrocious plotting
of the others

chapter ii

captain wiggins appears

the door swung open and a man
entered walked to the bar and stood
leaning on his elbow while he took a
general survey of the room he was short
and pursy with small keen gimlet-like
eyes bulbous features and a long grizzled
beard his head sagged forward on the
short neck like that of a great turtle and
his clothes fitted awkwardly with innu-
merable bags and wrinkles

  a massive chain of australian nuggets
with a heavy jade pendant adorned his
white waistcoat which was soiled with
stains and grease-spots all present recog-
nized him as captain of the schooner mama-
loa then in the harbor

  presently he came to the table and-
including the group in a single comprehen-
sive nod-leaned clumsily over the back of
a chair and signaled the proprietor for
drinks the five men looked at each other

   the characters of certain ships and their
captains become in time food for common
gossip in the south seas and captain wig-
gins was notorious as the closest-fisted
lime-juicer on the pacific notwith-
standing he paid for the drinks with a gold
sovereign sat down and drew up his chair
to the table he tossed off his drink at a
swallow and glanced at each face in turn

  want a job you men he asked
abruptly

  wot kind of a job growled welsh sus-
piciously we aint no bloomin focsle
ands an none of us is ships orcifers
from all i hear said captain wig-
gins you chaps arent in no position to
pick and choose owever it aint sailor-
mans work im alludin to its on an
island ill set you up every man of you
is own boss with plenty of gin and grub
youll ave to work ard and fast but it
wont be long and youll all come away with
money in your pockets at the end

  whats the lay asked davison
  guano

  welsh spat in disgust and wiggins went
on hastily

  i must ave some white men i can trust
and by all accounts you chaps while down
on your luck are trustworthy enough

   he looked around as if expecting approval
of the statement

  the last island i worked with a gang

of kanakas with one white man in charge 
they were pretty wild boys-shore men
from malaita they were-and when this
white johnny tried to order em around
they up and killed im drank all the gin
and quit workin on the job they ate
im too i believe anyway it was all dead
loss to me so i aint goin to ave that
appen again

  he airily signaled for more drinks and
leaned forward on the table in a confiden-
tial attitude

   eres the point my lads he con-
tinued this island is way off the beaten
track and as never been worked a little
while ago great britain sent along a cruiser
to annex it and they reported it a bird
island rich in guano deposit which is a
fact becauseive verified it myself

  now the queensland plantations are
fair starvin for fertilizer and none to be
ad at any price so i sent along an appli-
cation for a charter to work the island to
the british minister at onolulu where the
cruiser ad sailed from under sealed orders
ive got a few kanakas and i want some
white men to go too to ustle the job along
have you got the charter asked mat-
thews

  wait a bit another mans applied for
a charter too es a scoundrelly chap-
name of frawley-peraps youve eard of
im theres been a long delay over- it
my plan is to drop you men at the island
with everything needful go on to onolulu
and get the charter and then come back
and find a cargo quarried and sacked
ready -to take aboard so theres no time
lost

  in other words said tom you arent
dead-certain of getting this charter and in
case you dont youre taking time by the
forelock so to speak to cut in on this-
this frawley i believe you called him and
were to take the chances of some gunboat
picking us off and sending us to prison
nothing of the sort said captain wig-
gins gruffly indignant i tell you im
sure of the charter im endorsed by the
premier is own blessed self im an
honest man i am and known as such
this man frawley aint

   his voice rose truculently

  didnt i tell you fertilizers scarce
all i want is a cargo ready to and when i
put in for it wat in tophet are you
pickin about anyway ive made you an
brethren of the beach



offer if you dont want to take it theres
plenty more down-and-outers i can get
wholl be willin and glad of the chance
thanks captain no need to rub it in
how much are we to be paid for this illegal
and reprehensible transaction

  ill pay you traders wages-ten pounds a
month

   tom rose to his feet

and fertilizer so scarce too said he
what a spendthrift you are to be sure
good day captain thanks for the drinks  
captain wiggins face flushed a dark red
here whats all this- he began

  why we cant agree thats all to
tell the truth i like your proposition
myself-all but the figure handling stolen
guano isnt as clean a business as ivory-nuts
and copra and is worth a lot more money
i cant speak for these other gentlemen but
i think id rather do business with the other
man no doubt i can find him down at
sydney frawley you said his name was
didnt you

  oh come said wiggins be reason-
able and i will too

  he paused a moment for reflection he
had been at some pains to pick these men
for this purpose and it was quite true that
the price for fertilizer was soaring the
chemical product then being unknown for
him the venture meant a fortune but wig-
gins was not the man to let go of a dollar
without due consideration

  ill pay you double said he at last im-
pressively twenty pounds a month and
all found not a shillin more take it or
leave it

  tom resumed his seat and looked at the
others

  well what about it you fellows he
asked

  im on for one said welsh and the
rest nodded

  all right said wiggins as he rose to
leave and now thats settled its a lot
of money to ave to pay out but-youll
ave to earn it i tell you that

  cox fingered the few remaining shillings
in his pocket and looked thirstily at the
empty glasses

  how about a small advance captain
he asked

  wiggins took a sovereign from his pocket
and tossed it on the table

  thats all the advance youll get said
he it wont make you too drunk i guess

be at the wharf at daylight tomorrow

were sailing at eight

during the conversation a tall
man clad in worn but immaculate
pongee had been sitting near by
apparently engrossed in an ancient copy of
the dead bird when tom had risen
however and mentioned the name of the
other applicant for the charter he raised
his eyes and shot a keen glance at the
group about the table as wiggins started
for the door he threw aside the paper and
rose to his feet

  captain just a moment he called

  he was thin to emaciation his face
was sallow the skin drawn into hollows
beneath his cheek-bones yet it was at once
pleasing and compelling his long sensi-
tive hands were blue-veined and frail-look-
ing at times he was shaken with a hollow
metallic cough

  his rather tired features bore marks of
dissipation but also the unmistakable
stamp of gentility his nose was strongly
aquiline his eyes steady and so direct as to
be almost disconcerting when the tired
drooping eyelids were lifted around his
lips there hovered perpetually the shadow
of a mildly cynical half-mocking smile

  as men grow to recognize and appraise
each other in an island community mat-
thews recognized this man as one of unques-
tioned standing in the colony he had the
entree to the government house and the
fiji club and seemed to be well known to
men of affairs though he appeared to have
no active business of his own tom had
often seen him about the water-front always
idle alone and silent

  wiggins wheeled about

  ah good afternoon sir said he good
afternoon mr effingam

  captain without meaning to be an
eavesdropper i couldnt help overhearing
a part of your talk with these gentlemen
im interested would you mind letting
me in on it

 letting you in on it why-er-i
dont quite understand the matters not
important-at least not to you sir

  wiggins looked uncomfortable and flus-
tered as if he had been caught in some
covert act

  come come captain its about a
charter to work a guano island or something
isnt it you neednt be shy with me
io

adventure

have you enough men or would you like
another to join die party

  why id be glad of one more mr
effingam if you can tell me where to get
him a white man that is

  i was thinking of a white man said
effingham with a smile in fact im the
man myself

  you oh no mr effingam-

  why not

  well you see sir it-it isnt nice work
this isnt a picnic or a oliday cruise
mebbe you didnt ear me very well but
its quarryin guano sortin it by grades
and packin it for shipment its all right
for these men as are ard up and need the
money but not for you sir it would never
do at all

  at effinghams steady smile the captain
grew suddenly suspicious

  and why should you want to go off and
work on a guano island may i ask
effingham daughed

  for the same reason these gentlemen
do i guess im all in-stony broke
furthermore i havent any conscience
against making a dishonest dollar in this
scheme of yours and ill take it as a favor
if youll give me the chance captain
wiggins shook his head and the look of
suspicion deepened in his crafty eyes

  no sir it wont do i wont consider
it remember you men daylight tomor-
row

  he turned on his heel

  better listen a moment captain said
effingham quietly enough

  the captain paused his hand on the door
well put it this way besides being
broke i have reasons for wanting to leave
fiji for a time-my health for instance
another thing there was a little matter
of smuggled opium a year ago and another
of native women taken forcibly aboard a
schooner you know what i mean i guess
if the truth were told to the colonial sec-
retary it might make some stir

  now im dead in earnest about this
captain i want to go with you and no
hocus-pocus about it make the terms
anything you like

  captain wiggins writhed uncomfortably
effinghams eyes were on him and the
fugitive smile played around his lips he
seemed to have no doubt of the issue

  well said wiggins at last if youre
so set on it and youre broke as you say i

wont deny you the chance ill give you
ten pounds a month-no more come
aboard at daylight with the others

  with an air of relief he vanished through
the door

  -the thin man drew a chair to the table
it seems that fate or chance or what-
ever you choose to call it has thrown us
together gentlemen said he perhaps
it is the tutelary god of the beach-combers
who knows what opportunities may come
on that guano island the most unpromis-
ing prospect may mean a change of luck
and we all seem to need that lets drink
to our better fortune

  he beckoned to the barman who brought
a bottle and glasses effingham threw
down a gold-piece

  just pay yourself for the whole bottle
said he were going to need all of it and
more and bring a dozen bottles of soda
tom raised his glass the undercurrent
of raillery in effinghams speech rather
attracted him than otherwise

  i guess we all stand in need of a change
of luck as you say said he i cant
see it coming through looting guano beds
but heres hoping that it comes and each
one gets what he most desires

  id like to amend that said effingham
heres hoping that each gets what he
deserves

  and to this strange toast they all drank

chapter iii

the voyage of the mamaloa

 as tom matthews took his way to
 the wharf next morning he had a con-
fused and hazy recollection of blurred
lights much gin shocking stories and confi-
dences welshs red face and bellowing
laughter of many songs and maudlin toasts
as if they were setting forth on some pleas-
ant excursion instead of the last forlorn
hope of broken and desperate men

  through it all he recalled the face of
effingham calm impersonal polite yet
always with that quiet light of mockery
in the eyes it irritated him and in a vague
irrational way he sullenly resented it what
right had this sickly stranger admittedly
broken like himself to touch him on the
raw with his quiet self-possessed half-
ironical contempt tom wondered how
much of a fool he had made of himself
brethren of the beach

ii

  effingham had been courteous and friend-
ly when he spoke it was interesting and to
the point and he had provided drinks with
a liberality that belied his claim of being
stony broke the liquor had apparently
affected him not at all in the mephitic
atmosphere of davisons salacious stories
the gallic wickedness of douchets tales
the inanities of cox and the raw brutality
of the primitive welsh he had sat unruffled
and quietly urged them on to further flights

  the man seemed far gone with tubercu-
losis and coughed a good deal but he had
kept the drinks steadily on the move and
he it was who had inspired the air of celebra-
tion on the eve of their departure for the
cheerless guano island

  effingham was already at the wharf when
matthews arrived and one by one the
others straggled down a sour morose
gathering red-eyed and tremulous re-
sponding surlily to effinghams cheerful-
good morning

  with the exception of effingham who
had a chest a small bag or two and a cam-
era-case none of them had more than a
handful of personal effects

  they were aboard in good time and at
the appointed hour the mamaloa was under
way for her long monotonous voyage to the
island nearly three thousand miles away
she was old and sluggish seasoned with all
the odors of island traffic she reeked of
guano and the strong rancid smell of copra
and was alive with roaches and beetles

  captain wiggins a taciturn old martinet
on deep water carried himself with an
attempt at aloofness toward his passengers
and unbent only so far as to squablbe over
the interminable cribbage games it was
an absurd attitude in so undignified a figure
as the captain and effingham took quiet
delight in slyly baiting him

  captain he would say when wiggins
after losing a few games would sputter
about the dumb luck of his opponent
what you call luck is really the science
of the game it is too deep for you en-
tirely youll never understand it

  why ang it wiggins would reply i
played the bally game before you were born  
i believe you effingham would retort
quietly that is the sad part of it most
sea-captains think they can play cribbage
but they never can now to show you
what i mean let us play a rubber of three
games in five you wifi win the two first

and i will take the third fourth and fifth
the stakes will be ten shillings to be debited
against my wages against six bottles of that
beer you keep in your room under lock and
key

  the result would leave the captain in
a speechless rage bordering on imbecility
for it was always as effingham predicted
until the supply of beer running low the
captain flatly refused to play further against
so gifted an adversary

  for matthews had he possessed an even
temperament the voyage would have held
a fascination that increased from day to
day the charm of the deep blue pacific
fell upon him the teeming life of the sea
the wild soaring birds the far-off purple
mist of a high island or the clustered palms
and booming surf of the atolls cast over him
the inevitable spell that comes to the imagi-
native adventurer among the islands and
he would gather optimism from the broad
horizons and nightly hosts of low-hanging
stars

  but this mood would vary with one of 
extreme depression the voyage would
soon be over and leave him at the end delv-
ing for his daily bread in the uncleanness of
a guano island

  effingham spent his time taking sun-
baths smoking innumerable cigarets and
occasionally taking photographs which he
developed in the galley by a light of red
tissue paper amid the protests of the chi-
nese cook who objected to his reckless use
of fresh water

  he sat one day on the cabin house tink-
ering with his camera and tom with one
of his black moods uppermost flung himsfelf
down beside him effingham was deftly
pasting down a leather edge that had
worked loose

  hard lines isnt it said he without
looking up to have to admit to yourself
that youve got down to guano-digging
eh

  why yes said tom surprized its
damnable to have to admit it it makes
a man thoroughly sick of himself

  the trouble is you have an enlarged
ego said effingham you take the
whole shooting-match as something personal
and malignant give a man lack of initi-
ative too much gin and an erratic liver
and hell nourish a grouch against the whole
universe he has himself on his mind and
takes it all as a private grievance


adventure

  now you take our friend there- he
indicated welsh who lay on his back snor-
ing in tremendous basso-profundo- i
dont suppose reddy has a single worry in
that luminous thing he calls a head-be-
yond the next meal or the next drink

  tom looked at the slumbering - giant
whose lips had fallen apart in an animal
droop that exposed the tusk-like yellow
teeth

  all the same said he with a slight
shudder id hate to be like that

  thats where you are wrong my son
said effingham gravely people like
reddy are to be envied its the poor

thin-skinned-with sensitive souls that

get all the - there is out of this life

lets go below and shake up a cocktail
there was something in effinghams talk
that tom likened to a dose of strong bitter
tonic it was usually unpalatable but he
felt better for it in the end the frail
hawk-nosed young englishman had an in-
sight into his moods that was positively
uncanny at first tom had hoped rather
wistfully that it was sympathetic but it
was only rarely in a brief sentence or two
that effingham unbent from his air of in-
difference toward all things in general

  tom found him hopeless as a confidant
but there were times when a few words from
effingham drawled out in his lazy fashion
put a needed stiffening in his spine

jjfwjm they had been at sea a couple of
frfuin wees and effingham was sitting
one day his back against the cabin
skylight running idly through a pile of old
newspapers he had unearthed in the cap-
tains room when he tossed one over to
tom who sat close by

  right-hand column near the bottom
over the whisky ad said he something
that ought to interest you matthews
tom looked at the place indicated and
found the following notice

greward

  information wanted as to the whereabouts of
thomas matthews late of the schooner yacht
hyperion last heard of in honolulu in novem-
ber - the above reward in gold will be paid
for definite information p o box x san
francisco cal

  of course said effingham lazily light-
ing a cigaret there are lots and lots of tom
matthewses still its a queer coincidence
finding that aboard here the man wanted

is evidently not an embezzler or a murderer
the reward isnt large enough perhaps hes
been left a fortune by somebody whats
your opinion tommie

  tom crumpled up the paper and threw it
overboard

 how the - should i know no-
bodys leaving me a fortune ill warrant
that as you say there are plenty of people
with the same name and he walked away
leaving effingham smiling and spent an
unprofitable and uncomfortable half-hour
leaning on the rail wondering whether there
was more unsavory aftermath to the cruise
of the luckless hyperion

  time passed uneventfully enough on the
mamaloa they played cards drowsed in
the heat or told yarns as they sprawled on
the deck of evenings tom had heard many
rough stories but some of these were a reve-
lation of the heterogeneous villainy of the
south seas told as they were by men who
had played all the parts without shame and
boasted of it

  douchet and welsh were frankly crimi-
nals the proudest boast of the latter was
that there had once been a reward offered
for him dead or alive of a thousand pounds
for sticking up the paymaster of a railroad
gang

  even wiggins and his half-caste mate
spiritless men enough took a certain pride
in vulgar reminiscences of blackbirding
or recruiting native labor for the planta-
tions-the -lowest form of blackguardism
in the pacific and it was strange to hear old
wiggins who like most mean men prated
of his honesty and fairness tell in his dull
colorless voice of shooting down natives
among them women while others were
dragged into the boats concluding with-

  and so ye see i made six undred pound
clear all told and only three months
out

  davison was a stout baldish man of
middle age with a baritone voice whose
mellow bell-like sweetness had survived all
the ravages of dissipation he had an ultra-
british manner was insufferably talkative
and alternately sang old english ballads
snatches of half-forgotten church music or
operas and babbled the most shockingly
indecent stories

  a coarser more sodden figure could
scarcely be imagined and yet there were
still nights when he would stand clinging to
the after shrouds and sing in a way that
brethren of the beach

l

brought tears to more than one of his audi-
ence and the watch below would creep on
deck to listen but he sang only when he
was half drunk and the gin taking hold
would relapse into mere maudlin garrulity

  cox was thin and wiry with a nose of
reddish purple and a perpetual foolish smile
under one corner of his mustache that gave
him at once an air of rakishness and weak-
ness he was an irresponsible creature
cranky and querulous despite his foolish
smile and yet he was the one of all the com-
pany whom matthews pitied

   there was no real harm in the man his
qualities were too negative for that he
was rather of the lost dog type and as
he was inclined at times to be talkative tom
learned something of his history

  he and davison had been sent down
from cambridge in their first year they
had been mere idlers at school and since
boyhood davison had held cox by a curious
mental ascendency it was through a
series of vicious escapades of the formers
contriving that they were expelled from the
university it was a sufficient disgrace but
instead of making an effort at redemption
davison had gone on the road with a barn-
storming opera company followed by the
faithful cox whose sphere of usefulness
extended no further than the carrying of a
banner in the chorus

  when the patience of their respective
families was exhausted they were shipped
summarily to the colonial dumping-ground
for younger sons and with the aid of small
allowances paid over quarterly advised to
shift for themselves

   the system that produces the remittance-
man is not so cruel as might be supposed
the exile is almost invariably a scamp he
has worked himself out of his sphere at
home by lack of application to anything
useful but there is nothing to prevent his
making for himself a decent and honorable
career only he must not stray from the
base of supplies or he will forfeit his remit-
tance which takes considerable courage

  neither cox or davison were of that
stuff however and in the long years since
they had left home it is doubtful if they had
 done one useful or ambitious thing they
had drawn their quarterly allowances spent
them riotously and between whiles drifted
into intimacy with heaven knows what
forms of unspeakable vice cox it is to be
believed fell regretfully clinging weakly to

the shadow of a thing called honor yet
trailing along protestingly in the wake of
davison a sorry enough leader

  once they had separated and davison
wrecked on a schooner in torres strait re-
turned to find his remittance discontinued
since then they had both fared on the scant
bounty of cox this however was no
longer available for a short time before cox
had news of the death of his father and
a change in the estate and he too could
now expect nothing more from his people
the allowance spent for gin in suva was his
last and the present voyage was a matter
of blind necessity yet cox for all his
crankiness was stoical enough about this

  davie and ive been a couple of cads
said he its so easy in this bally wilder-
ness and now weve jolly well got to pay
for it

  he confided to tom rather shyly that he
wrote home once a year to a sympathetic
older sister who sent him news of an old
sweetheart long since married and the
mother of children

  of course i lost her said cox resigned-
ly i wasnt fit to black her boots time
was though old chap when her memory
kept me out of many a dirty scrape

  tom mindful of his own case felt for the
spiritless creature a sort of forlorn fellowship

  the white men lounged about the after-
deck and made themselves free with the
spirits but the kanakas a good-natured
mixed lot no two of whom came from the
same group of islands chummed with the
crew in the forecastle one of them a tall
young gilbert islander whom they called
joey-a smiling fellow handsome as a
young polynesian god-had attached him-
self to effingham from the first with the
unselfish dog-like affection so -often seen
and so rarely appreciated among the island -
people

  the polynesians are dependent almost
to childishness and spontaneous attach-
ments of a brown man for a white are quite
common-too often alas taken base ad-
vantage of

  joey became unaffectedly a sort of attend-
ant on effingham-glad to be sent on an
errand proud to share his tobacco and
when effingham made and developed
a snap-shot of him in the finery of a new
turkey-red lava-lava joey begged from him
an oath that some day epihama would
go with him to his home at apemama


adventure

  one morning they came on deck to find
the schooner beating up toward a volcanic
island the captain in the fore-rigging cast-
ing for an opening in the great combers that
roared at the edge of the reef little
flying-fish fled before the schooners bow in
shoals and the air was full of birds they
fought and screamed for the waste that the
cook threw over the side they perched
upon the gaffs and cross-trees and even
alighted fearlessly and lumbered about the
deck

  the captain turned and shouted to the
mate at the wheel pointing to a short pole
on an elevated point from which streamed
the few small red tatters that remained of
a british ensign the mate put the wheel
over and presently they came to anchor
within a cables length of the shore that was
to be home for a term of months to a dozen
of the schooners company

  they scanned it curiously and found it
wholly unprepossessing

  what do they call the place asked
tom of the captain

  give it up was the reply it hasnt
a name so far as i know youre the origi-
nal settlers barrin the birds why not name
it yourselves im layin that before youre
though- he gave a grim chuckle-youll
be callin it seven different kinds of-

chapter iv

smoldering fires

the island was an insignificant dot in
the great waste of blue pacific lying
well to the west and north of the marshalls
it was between three and four miles long
and about three-quarters of a mile across at
its widest point it was fundamentally
composed of black lava rock the summit of
a great peak rising sheer from the ocean
floor but save in the abrupt forbidding
wall of the windward coast the rock showed
only as outcropping in the wind-swept
places through deep deposits of guano

  seen from a distance at sea it appeared
blurred and shifting of outline from the
wheeling hosts of birds along the lee shore
for nearly its entire length ran a narrow
barrier reef partially exposed at low tide
which enclosed near its center a small har-
bor which was neither bay nor lagoon but
a mere opening fed by fresh-water springs
where the coral would not build

  here the land had a pleasanter aspect
the shore was lined with a belt of beach-
grass there were a few score of coconut and
pandanus palms and farther inland the
small valley was choked with hau and kou
trees while ferns i-plants and creepers
grew in profusion here it was that they
pitched their camp

  the kanakas skilled and intelligent
workers built huts of leaves and braided
fiber that were airy and comfortable and
strong enough to weather anything short
of a hurricane in addition to these as
shelters there were four tents and when
these were erected they built a large open
lanai for a common living-room its floor
was a strip of canvas laid on the sand the
sides a series of poles which supported a roof
of palm-trees loosely bound together on
the side toward the northeast was a movable
wind-break of heavy canvas old and
stained with many patches

  a surf-boat considerately left by wig-
gins lay high up on the beach under an
open shed which was also thatched with the
indispensable palm-leaves

  in a weeks time they had settled down to
the dreary monotony of their work it was
revolting enough but it exacted only muscu-
lar effort and work they must day after
day at the same offensive drudgery for
wiggins the exacting must be satisfied or
they would get no money

  at first it was not so hard they rose in
the morning churlish and taciturn but
a plunge in the cool green water of the little
bay and a meal of fresh fish and coffee
helped raise their spirits at night they
returned caked with grime through which
the sweat had cut weird patterns to plunge
again into the purging water

  then after the evening meal there were
card-games songs stories and drinks-
always and inevitably drinks wiggins
knowing his men and their requirements
had left a prodigious quantity of trade gin
that he eventually would make them meet
part of the expense by withholding it from
their wages they were well aware but that
was a matter of small concern

  food they had in plenty in addition to
their ships stores there were eggs to be had
for the gathering fish swarmed about the
reef coconuts were abundant and turtles
were frequent visitors to the beach there
was water-cress in the spring a few wild
plaintains and yams grew in the valley and
brethren of the beach



if they craved sweets they had only to dig
ti-root and bake it

  they planned ways at first to make life
more tolerable and some of the schemes
were ludicrous in the extreme one of
douchets was that some one take the boat
and two kanakas sail for the nearest in-
habited island and return with a boat-load
of women as they had no chart nor com-
pass and the nearest populated island was
pingalap over a thousand miles away the
proposal was received with shouts of laugh-
ter at which the little frenchman sulked
for days

  one of the kanakas had a wheezy con-
certina another a small antiquated portu-
guese guitar which it was impossible to keep
in tune on account of the pegs slipping
the repertoire of the boys was limited but
out of these unpromising instruments
davison the musician of the party man-
aged to coax some far-off semblance to
melody and there were nights when the
wondering birds listened to as weird a ren-
dition of annie laurie or nellie was
a lady as ever was heard

 there were swimming-races and im-
promptu boxing and wrestling matches
spells of boyish humor would strike them
simultaneously when they would roar with
laughter at the silliest trifles their differ-
ences and faults forgotten and for the time
they were jolly if boisterous comrades
these moods be it said were usually in-
spired by square-face gin

  but the change was inevitable and grad-
ually it came the stories had all been told
and retold their resources of entertain-
ment reached a limit they took to brood-
ing apart sullenly tempers flared out at
trifles and ugly quarrels grew more and
more frequent

  matthews high-strung nervous and at
a tension from the first felt the change more
than the others to him the nightly car-
ousals were a mental relief from chronic
neurasthenia his companions with the
exception of effingham grew insufferable
before long there was no way of keeping up
even a semblance of comradeship without
square-face and card-games to help clear
the air of the hatefulness and the quarrels
always smoldering near the surface

  two months after their arrival at the
island their enforced association had an
actual pathos that bordered on tragedy
they were like men doomed to an arctic

winter in the confines of a vessel in each
mans breast there lurked an intolerance of
his fellows they magnified one anothers
faults and their own petty grievances and
seldom spoke to each other during the early
hours of the day

  if any man touched and brought forth
a note from the concertina or the whining
guitar there was an instantaneous roar of
protest from the others and it was only
after sweating for long hours at the guano
beds and later mellowed by successive
drinks that they warmed into anything
approaching affability

  at night the four incapables squabbled
incessantly over the card-games and tom
in exasperation would often have suc-
cumbed to the same weakness had it not
been for the inscrutable smiling face of
effingham he could not bear further to
depreciate himself under the mocking gaze
of those eyes alight with understanding
and appraisal

  effingham alone seemed apart-detached
as it were from all the squabbles indifferent
to the affairs of the rest maintaining an un-
failingly even temper and the ability when
he chose to exercise it of rallying them with
a word or two into a better humor

  he drank as much as the others but it
had little effect on him no amount of
liquor could break down his reticence he
kept much to himself attended by the faith-
ful joey and his cough grew steadily worse

and then occurred one of those
queer freaks of destiny which we
weakly call chance which not only
cleared the surcharged atmosphere for the
time but changed thecurrent of all their lives

  tom matthews sat alone on the beach
the west was aglow with the tremendous
conflagration of tropic sunset the huge ball
of red sun surrounded by a blaze of raw
orange shading into crimson and then to the
tenderest mauve across this blinding dis-
play lay long strata of purple clouds sta-
tionary unchanging their edges bright with
a thin line as of gold wire the birds were
lazily winging shoreward for the night a
school of mullet leaped and sported in the
bay and the sea toward the sun was a long
ruddy pavement from beach to horizon

  tom wondered just how far such pictures
were responsible for his present position
he had always been on the point of taking
active part in the medley of island affairs
i

adventure

but the accomplishment was ever a day or
two in the future and the long languorous
days had melted into each other in a suc-
cession of blazing sunsets time is of little
account where each day is like another

  there is no reminder in the passing sea-
sons but now there were other things to
remind him that he owed himself an
accounting he was done with the beach
forever if he could not pull himself to-
gether with the proceeds of his work on the
island he could at least obliterate himself
and avoid any more intolerable situations
like the present

  he took from his breast a small locket
that hung from his neck by a loop of sennit
the watch-chain from which it once de-
pended had long since gone with the watch
to supply material wants but he had never
parted with the locket

  it contained a photo of a young woman
about twenty-two smiling alert in love
with life and yet with perhaps too much of
the patrician air there was something
uncompromising in the set of the lips and
chin tom remembered her unreasoning
firmness in some of their few unimportant
differences and his own good-natured com-
pliance if dorothy had had one fault in
his eyes it was that of intruding principle
into small matters

  this was the face of the girl who had
written him that letter received at hono-
lulu as he sat studying it a chorus of high-
pitched voices broke out in altercation in
the distant lanai he caught coxs whining
treble

  -it davie the jack fell four hands

ago dont be a rotter

  then welshs strident bellow

  play cards wot the-are ye raggin

about

  tom rose tore the locket from its fasten-
ing and with a deep curse flung it far into
the sea

  he stood watching it as it sped in a long
shining arc and long after it struck the
water he still stood as if turned to stone
then he drew a long breath and walked
slowly toward the lanai

  once he stopped and looked back uncer-
tainly the sun had gone and the quick
tropic night was falling then he turned
and whistling a tune walked on briskly
he could face the future now unhampered
by a sentimental millstone round his neck

  at the first gray shine of dawn he was

wading out through the shoal water to the
point where he estimated the locket had
fallen he had found sleep impossible
in a moment of bitterness he had blamed
an unreasonable woman for his own years
of folly and weakness though in his heart
he knew that her memory had been his
cleanest asset and had kept him from the
commoner vileness of the beach that he
thoroughly despised this unheroic vacilla-
tion made him none the less anxious to
recover the locket

  he had half-unconsciously taken a bear-
ing the night before but he had not waded
far before he came to a sharp edge of the
reef that marked the end of the shoal water
the bottom fell in a sharp slope and the
color of the water shaded from a clear tur-
quoise to deep green time and again he
dived without result

  the bottom was dark and slimy and
seemed to be covered with masses and clus-
ters of small round jagged rocks remarka-
bly uniform in size and their edges tore the
skin of his hands and forearms till they were
raw and bleeding

  he was forced to desist at last from sheer
exhaustion

  near by the kanakas were wading
out chattering in btche-de-mcr with small
throwing-nets over their shoulders tom
called to joey who chanced to be nearest
he explained to the boy what he wished as
nearly as possible describing the locket as-

  all same ten-dolla-piece gold

  joey with a flash of white teeth slid
silently into deep water and vanished he
reappeared after an interminable time
shook his head grinned and again disap-
peared repeating the performance several
times without result meantime tom heard
a hail and turned to find effingham wading
toward him

  he had returned from a mysterious rite
which he preformed twice daily and for
which he offered no explanation every
morning and evening since their arrival he
had gone to the summit of a knoll where the
whole horizon was visible and swept the sea
for a full half-hour with a long brass tele-
scope tom who had a dread of em-
barrassing questions made a gesture of
annoyance

  taking soundings tommie asked
effingham pleasantly pretty deep water
here

  just then joeys head appeared
brethren of the beach



  i think no can find said he blowing
like a brown porpoise too much this
kind shell

  he had one of the flat black rocks in his
hand and tossed it into the shallow water
of the reef

  all right joey no matter said tom
splashing shoreward

  hold on tommie said effingham in
so strange a voice that tom turned toward
him quickly

  he was examining the black stone care-
fully it had slimy weeds wrapped about
it and as effingham pulled them off tom
saw that instead of a rock it was a large
odd-looking shell-fish

  effingham turned to joey

  you say plenty more stop below he
asked

  plenty the boy replied too much
stop thousand thousands

  effingham carried the shell to the beach
deliberately assumed his clothing and
picked up his telescope and they proceeded
to the camp keola the hawaiian was
cooking breakfast welsh stood naked two
hundred and fifty pounds of magnificent
brawn flexing his huge muscles the
others in their working-garb of dungaree
trousers were passing the bottle for the
morning drink effingham tossed the rough
shell-fish on the sand in their midst

  gentlemen said he it is a fine morning
the goddess of fortune is with us observe

  his face was impassive as usual but his
thin nostrils were wide and there was the
trace of a sparkle in his eye the others
gathered round and inspected the find
silently at first till douchet on a sudden
broke out in a wild cackle of laughter and
danced insanely and welsh with a loud
guffaw smote him gleefully on the back and
sent him sprawling

  what the deuce is the thing asked
matthews

  treasure trove replied effingham
the thing men lie and steal and murder
for thats a pearl oyster tommie

chapter v

holloway explains

aitss dorothy gardiner sat at
j-va an upper window of the fairview
hotel in san francisco and watched the
gray fog roll in from the golden gate it

came in detached ragged sheets a tattered
squadron moving swiftly-silent and omin-
ous tamalpais and the sausalito shore
were blotted out and alcatraz had become
a mere dark smudge on the murky water of
the bay

  dorothy shivered a little as she watched
although the room was warm and the chill
damp of the night not yet fallen she did
not like san francisco it had an unpleas-
ant effect on her spirits which were none
too buoyant at best long and assiduous
devotion to an invalid maiden aunt had
given her mind too grave a cast she took
life and its responsibilities altogether too
seriously for a splendid robust young
woman of twenty-six and san francisco
fog is most depressing

  she had been talking a while ago with
some hotel acquaintances but lately re-
turned from the islands and the verbal
pictures they had drawn of the long warm
beaches the gorgeous flowering trees and
the splendid hills orange-tinted in the glow
of sunset had filled her with a certain
amount of enthusiasm

  in comparison with san francisco the
islands seemed a paradise the pitiless fog
reacted on her spirits and dorothy sighed
audibly as she sat alone in the hotel aware
that she was very forlorn and unhappy

  a bell-boy knocked and delivered a card
she set her lips firmly over her small white
teeth and made a furtive dab at her eyes
she had barely time to glance at the card
when its owner who had followed hard
upon the heels of t-he boy bounced into the
room seized both her hands and wrung
them vigorously

  dot he cried how are you girlie
say youre glad to see me-quick
dorothys eyes widened

 jack holloway why jack-

  the same-i swear it john francis
holloway late of boston now a resident of
the golden state saw your name in the
hotel arrivals three days ago and would
have come at once but i had to make a fly-
ing trip to los angeles how are you and
how do you like san francisco and what on
earth are you doing here

  im well and i dont like san francisco
a bit it gives me the blues im traveling
with aunt margaret for her health shes
an invalid you know

-	the young man looked at her keenly
he was a clean-cut manly fellow of under
i

adventure

thirty clear-eyed and wholesome and there
was a friendliness mingled with concern in
his eyes

  same old thing eh dot-assuming
the privilege of a friendship that dates from
the cradle-ill say that you look fagged
out youre tired and that smile of yours
has a little droop it didnt have the last
time i saw you ever since i can remember
youve been dancing attendance on your
aunt margaret and it hasnt been the best
thing in the world for you why dont you
kick over the traces once in a while
dorothy looked anxiously at the door
separating the two rooms and put her finger
to her lips

  s-sh aunties in there taking her
nap-

  oh come now tell me dot how sick
is your aunt-really

  she made a little face

  why-why jack there isnt anything
really serious the matter with her shes
what the doctor calls a chronic valetudi-
narian i believe it was you who used to
say that she enjoyed poor health old
maids like auntie and me usually have hob-
bies and hers is to imagine herself very ill
she lowered her voice and again glanced
cautiously at the door

  you must never repeat it jack but
once in a while she forgets and we have
a real good time other times we live by
routine and formulas shell wake up pres-
ently and want koumyss and beef-tea at
exactly a hundred and sixty-two degrees
holloway crossed his legs lighted a
cigaret and smoked in silence a while

  dot said he thoughtfully this old
maid stuff from you would be funny if it
werent a little pathetic of course i know
what happened four years ago was a good
deal of a shock to you it would have been
to any one under the circumstances but
i dont believe youve ever been told the
truth about it else you wouldnt spring
this old maid talk on me tom wouldnt
tell of course

  i should have written you long ago but
there are things you cant make look con-
vincing and right on paper ive felt like a
coward and probably acted like one hoping
youd be set straight somehow but when
i saw your name on that list i saw the
chance to find out and explain things if no
one else had and here i am i see now that
i should have done it long ago it was ac-

tually craven of me and when ive done you
can call me anything you like

  jack are you talking about that-that

yacht because if you are-

  im going to tell you the truth about
tom dorothy

  well you can spare yourself-and me
i have heard quite enough-more than
enough-and dont want to hear any more
my only wish is to forget it all i find it
hard enough as it is please dont revert to
it again

  do you mean to say youve treated tom
matthews that way-turned him down
without a hearing

  if thats the way you choose to put it
i have-certainly much as i cared for
tom i couldnt trust my future with a-

a drunkard and a-a-

  oh lord do you mean to tell me you
wrote him stuff like that

  i gave him my opinion of his conduct-
and yours and the rest of you i had to
tell the truth and- oh dont talk
about it

  and did he answer you-offer any ex-
planations i mean

  no

  holloway rose and paced back and forth
the length of the room then he stopped
before her put his hand beneath her chin
and tilted her face up to his

  dot said he gravely you loved the
boy i know you did little woman dont
you love him any more

  dorothys face flamed red her chin
quivered and she tried to turn her head but
he held her facing him mercilessly

  jack holloway she flared angrily with
a hysterical note in her voice how dare
you ask me that what is it to you you
were one of that disgraceful horrid party and

now you come here to-to torment me-

  she broke down and sobbed frankly into
her handkerchief holloway took another
turn about the room

  hang it he muttered what chance
has a man in a case like this

  then he stopped before her

  dot he said you can think as you
like about me it wont be as bad as ive
thought about myself nor half what i de-
serve perhaps im not trying to make a
case for myself and whatever you think
im going to talk to you like a big brother
instead of a sort of thirty-second cousin
youre a chump now wait-listen
brethren of the beach



  its aunt margarets fault i guess but
youve grown prudish and self-opinionated
about things of which you know nothing
whatever youve set yourself up as judge
and jury over every man on that yacht con-
demned them wholesale and turned down

the best fellow of them all-

  jack holloway-

  -the best fellow of them all-sent him
to the devil i guess for no one has heard
of him for four years-without a hearing
or a chance to square himself

  she faced him her fists clenched her
bosom heaving

  jack holloway you are presuming on
old friendship you are insulting if thats

all you came to say-

  holloway winced but his jaw set and
a slight smile played about the corners of
his mouth

  it so happens that youve got to hear
me dorothy ive made you angry-a good
sign that ive been hoping for-and your
imperiousness doesnt feeze me a bit i
wont be unpleasant any more and for your
own sake and toms please listen attentive-
ly and patiently

  when i left him in honolulu he was in
a bad way he had lost all his money and
was going down among the islands for
a while he was all broken up and i
thought it was the money he didnt tell
me he had heard from you and i never
guessed it

  youre all wrong about him dot he
was the one real man of the party the
rest were all that was reported of us-a lot
of egregious asses whose idea of fun was
a riot and who deserved all they got-
he suddenly gulped-all of us that is
except poor carson and charlie wheeler

we played poker and raised the-most

of the time and drank all of the time

  the papers were quite right about there
being women and hula dances aboard at
honolulu that probably hit you the
hardest

  well while that was going on tom and
i were over on the island of hawaii at the
volcano house on the edge of the crater of
kilauea we didnt get to honolulu till the
day the hyperion sailed thats three
words for tom and one for myself

  the wreck was terrible dorothy the
smashing of that yacht on the reef-the
boiling surf-the awful ruthlessness of it-
are things that murder my sleep and always

will i know that sounds trite but you

should have seen it-

  as for tom he was the one sane sober
man aboard and had been since we started
he did everything but humiliate himself
to bring the rest to their senses he would
have quit us at honolulu but was too game
to do it

  i had half my ribs and an arm broken in
the wreck and it was tom who dragged me
ashore through the surf or id have gone
with carson and wheeler to the sharks
he helped half a dozen others save their
lives till he gave out and the kanakas pulled
him ashore half-drowned and sobbing like
a boy now you have the truth and if you
want confirmation ill get some of the fellows
to give it by george ill make them do it
but why didnt tom write and tell me
about this how was i to know after all

those reports-

  reports reports hang the reports
youve taken them and jumped at conclu-
sions without trying to get at the truth at
all how could tom explain anything
is a man going to come to you and tell you
he was the only good little kitten in the
basket toms not a wild indian like that
san francisco crowd hes a man clear
through good enough for any woman on
earth and if i were you and cared for him
at all id hunt him with a fine-tooth comb

and square myself-

  ahem said a dry voice

  peering at them through a crack in the
doorway was a lean ascetic face with iron-
gray hair in disarray

  jack holloway you young scamp
youve cut my nap short twelve minutes
with your loud voice but im glad to see
you ill be out in a few minutes
holloway sprang forward and vigorously
shook a thin hand protruding from a flowing
kimono sleeve

  my dear miss gardiner im delighted
to see you i hope you are well i was just
suggesting to dorothy that we all go down
to the poodle dog for supper

chapter vi

pearl-shell

cffingham smashed the heavy shell
 with a rock and sawed at the tough
adductor muscles with his knife then he
tore out the great quivering mollusc from


adventure

its beautiful bed of iridescent nacre and
there adhering to the lower shellwere three
large irregular pearls they were of the
kind known as baroques and in the body of
the oyster was one tiny round gem perfect
in form and color

  that day and for many days thereafter
the guano beds were neglected the new
occupation of pearl-diving was taken up
with feverish enthusiasm the sea-floor
was fairly paved with the great shell-fish
and the men dived and wrenched at them
till their lungs were bursting they kept at
it till they were utterly exhausted and slept
like logs often where they dropped on the
open beach

   all took part till the shoal water had been
cleared of shell and they were obliged to
work more systematically the boat was
rigged with a platform and diving-stones to
weight the divers and the difficult work
began of bringing up shell from depths of
four fathoms and over

  it was hard and dangerous labor the
strain upon the divers was prodigious and
there were dangers unseen and terrible
lying below

  from one of these came their first trag-
edy kuma a butaritari boy was rising
to the surface the air in his lungs exhausted
when one of the hideous snake-eels called
puhi-paka by the natives seized him by the
hand with its terrible jaws armed with row
upon row of needle-sharp teeth dragging his
arm into a hole in the reef kanakas
dread the puhi more than they do the
shark but they know how to meet his
attack	

  no human strength could break the grip
of the giant eel but kuma waited till the
monster relaxed to get a fresh purchase with
his tail then shoved with all his strength and
tore away his mutilated hand an instant
sooner and the lacerated hand would have
been his only injury but he had burst
a blood-vessel and died that night

  nevertheless the work went on steadily
there grew row after row of the great
oysters high up on the beach there to
rot out in the sun till the shells could be
cleaned of their contents the bed was a
comparatively small one

  in three weeks they had taken the last
shell with a diving-armor it might have
been done in as many days but it covered
a very satisfying area of white beach as
they laid it out in the sun and was a thing

for these men to gloat over and speculate
and dream about

   they lay about when the work was done
nursing salt-water sores and various wounds
and bruises they were a very tired com-
pany but their attitude toward life and
each other had changed they were no
longer broken men delving in the guano for
captain wiggins they were men of sub-
stance owners of a bed of shell the aristo-
cratic holding of the pacific they could
drop in at any port show a pocketful of
pearls and an air of mystery and be pointed
out as men of note the tainted air from
the rotting shell was laden with optimism

   the question before the house is what
about wiggins said matthews

  well wot about wiggins growled
welsh wiggins asnt any finger in this
pie

  of course not reddy but you cant
convince him of that if he hears whats in
the wind wholl guarantee he wont hear
of it there may be a fortune there in
pearls-and then there may not but what-
ever there is give wiggins a hint and hell
hog the whole business to say nothing of
the shell

  hah said douchet dose shell is
nos-sing its de pearl i see em at
tursday island so-o-o beeg dey pay
ow much you tink two tousand pound
-maybe more de pearl can go in de
pocket an weegins e know nossing about
it de shell-pouf we sink im in de sea

  the kanaka boys were in a group by
themselves not far away and effingham
nodded toward them significantly

   theres where the trouble lies said
he those boys are bound to chum with
wiggins kanaka crew and what they tell
will be told aft be sure of that then its
good-by pearls

  welsh looked at the kanakas and
straightened up his fingers began to
twitch and gradually a strange expression
came over his face one corner of his mouth
drew up and his little eyes took on an ex-
pression of cunning ferocity that could not
be mistaken effingham laughed outright

   oh come reddy said he were not
going to kill off the boys yet awhile why
theyve done all the hard work well have
to organize thats all its a simple matter

   as for that shell its worth two hundred
dollars a ton at shanghai there may not
be more than two cents worth of pearls in
brethren of the beach



the lot if there isnt it would be wise
i think to cache the shell one might come
back some day you know

  at any rate as far as the pearls are-con-
cerned theres no use crossing a bridge till
we get to it wait till we know what weve
got

  ah said welsh thats the-of it

mates this ere waitin my nerves is all

of a shiver thank-we ave plenty of

gin

  while we are on the subject continued
effingham i think it would be well if we all
agreed to let that shell alone till the final
cleaning up i saw you probing around
there douchet and you too cox and
i chased joey and keola away this morning
weve got to have some system and i sug-
gest that the shell be left alone till the final
clean-up of course you chaps have ideas
of your own im only giving you mine
thats all

  right said welsh and ill give you
mine mates were all gentlemen with
equal rights and privileges as you may say
and a man as voylates em ought to be shot
i say keep away from that shell under pen-
alty of death till the proper time just let
me get these fins on the man as doesnt

chapter vii

plans and resolutions

tom matthews rolled over on his
bed of mats and sat up hours before
he had aroused from a coma that in no way
resembled refreshing sleep and had since
lain awake cursing the abominable odor
and nursing his throbbing temples a
square-face of gin stood within reach of
his hand and he gulped down a swallow
rose wearily and slipped his bare feet into
straw sandals

  it was gray dawn the trade wind had
not yet risen and the sea rolled lazily at the
edge of the barrier reef no one was stir-
ring on the beach but as he passed effing-
hams tent he heard a hollow racking cough
within effingham had been failing fast of
iate and his cough had grown steadily
worse

  the stoical young englishman never
alluded to himself or his ailment and would
have railed at any spoken sympathy but
as tom looked round the lonely islet
bleaker than ever in the gray of morning

the pathos and tragedy of it struck him like
a blow

  god he muttered what a place to
die in

  an eighth of a mile away an acre or so of
beach was covered with the shell in the pro-
cess of rotting out and the poisonous
festering mass smelled to high heaven day
and night unabated by rain or wind the
awful odor hung like a pall-ubiquitous
intolerable-dominating even the snuffy
pungent ammonia smell of the guano at
night the mass emitted a pale shimmering
phosphorescence by day under the hot
sun the air above it shuddered in phantas-
magoric waves

  matthews made a detour round the shell
and turned inland across a low plateau
there were birds in countless legions their
crude nests cumbered the ground they
filled the air and dotted the surface of the
sea huge albatrosses fierce-eyed and
scornful lumbered grudgingly out of his
way somber frigate-birds with crimson
pouches at their throats hissed and snapped
at him truculently while clouds of gulls
and smaller birds took protesting flight to
settle again as he passed

  he reached the windward side of the
island and threw himself at full length on
a rocky eminence overlooking the sea to-
morrow they would clean the shell and he
had found the strain of waiting almost un-
bearable filled with new resolutions he
burned with impatience to put them into
practise he was going to reestablish his
manhood-to think of himself once more by
the ambiguous word gentleman without
flinching

  he was young and there was still a
chance all things were possible if he quit
drinking and took a grip on himself he
longed for cut glass and silver fine linen the
society of well-dressed men and women-
to be in touch with his kind again on equal
terms but these things were conditional
on there being valuable pearls in the shell
and the uncertainty had keyed his over-
wrought nerves to the breaking point

  what lay hidden in the corruption of the
pearl-shell was problematical divided
among them all it might mean no more than
a trifle for each however small his share
tom intended to put it to good use and if
he could not have at once those things that
represented the amenities of life he would
find a way to them eventually


adventure

  he had brooded too long over a woman
who had thrown him over unfairly he
would never forget her-her memory would
always be a scar-but he would make a
fresh start in spite of it he had quite re-
covered from the feeling of loneliness with
which he had been stricken after having
impulsively flung away the locket and
rejoiced to be free from that last link which
bound him with the past

  regarding the pearls tom found plenty
of cause for uneasiness he reviewed the
individual traits of his companions their
strained attitude toward each other and
the smoldering hostility and distrust that
had grown through being so long together
in this lonely place

  four of the men were either actual or po-
tential criminals effingham though tom
instinctively trusted him was an enigma
for all that and his sinister and pessimistic
allusions whenever the pearls were men-
tioned coming as they did from a dying
man were disturbing it seemed inevitable
that if many pearls were found trouble
would follow in so mixed and uncongenial
a company

 uneasy and depressed tom walked
slowly back across the island no one was
at work on the guano beds the kanakas
were off fishing on the reef and the white
men were sitting about on the beach or
wandering nervously around the vicinity of
the shell

  in spite of their compact the temptation
to probe at the oysters fast growing leath-
ery and shriveled in the sun was almost
irresistible the square-face was passing
freely even welsh the stolid giant was
visibly nervous

  my word said he wiping his mouth
with a huge paw i wish that stinkin
mess was cleaned up suppose a ship
should appen in now with all that shell
laid out it would be cruel ard to be stuck
up for all that swag mates

  effingham winked at tom

  listen to the lion roar said he reddy
the bushranger afraid of being held up
how about you frenchy

  douchet looked at the shell and ground
his teeth wickedly

  sacre said he suppose she come
now for dose pearl i would cut ze eart from
hevery man on ze sheep

  spoken like a little man said effing-
ham no lack of spirit in frenchy here

i should like to see a mans heart cut out
it must be curious

  theres no need to borrow that kind of
trouble said tom we havent seen
a sail in three months and theres none
coming were too far off the track
dont be too sure my son

  effingham rolled a cigaret with a quick
deft twist of finger and thumb

things usually happen at the wrong
time pearls especially looted ones like
these smell of trouble as sure as they smell
of rotten oysters pass the gin tommie
davison yawned loudly

  here comes keola with a bag of mullet
said he and joeys got some crawfish
good chuck in sight boys lets have a
small game to work up an appetite

  they gathered in the lanai and began a
rather desultory game of poker long
association had made each mans style of
play familiar to the others cox was cau-
tious and timid uncertain of a good hand
unless stimulated by drink davison rather
stolid and consistent for so mercurial
a game as poker he played a far better
game of whist welsh was blunderingly
aggressive with strong oaths when luck
went against him

  douchet throughout a game sat tense
and nervous plucking at his pointed black
beard his mean little close-set eyes alight
with avarice he snatched at his winnings
greedily and it was understood that he
would cheat when possible

  effingham by far the best player seemed
indifferent to the game and unruffled by
winnings or losses but his slim fingers
manipulated the cards with the skill of a
born gambler and he invariably won at
any game they chose to play

  tom played the fair average game of
most americans when the game is draw
poker but it had long ceased to interest
him he was weary of the greed of welsh
and douchet the babbled obscenities of
davison and coxs eternal grin and whining
voice yet he played when the others did
for the game was a relief from mental stag-
nation

  it lacked intrinsic interest for there was
nothing to play for they had staked their
prospective pay from wiggins so often bor-
rowing and reborrowing that it haci grown
into a hopeless jumble of accounts that no
one attempted to straighten out

  they now played for chips made of the
brethren of the beach



limbs of trees of different-colored woods
sawed into thin discs these had a purely
chimerical value of twenty-five cents fifty
cents and a dollar each according to color
the values being represented by sandalwood
hau and kou woods respectively

  they played till meal-time the game
dragged but they were all in good humor
and for the time they warmed toward each
other and expanded into something like
geniality it struck matthews with a glow
of surprize and made him rather ashamed
of his uneasy suspicions

  from their present attitude one would
have thought them the best comrades in the
world they were all in fact building air-
castles with foundations of pearls

  after the meal they resumed the game by
the light of smoky lanterns but presently
welsh threw down his hand

  blow the cards said he lets chuck
it weve a bigger gamble out there on the
beach than well ever get out of these
greasy old palammers me mind aint on
em its on a pub in sydney where the
fighters drop in now and then ive a fancy
to buy it and tryne fighters meself and be
genteel in a top-at ive always wanted
to own a pub

  im for the poodle dog in san fran-
cisco said matthews im going to or-
der a canvas-back with sauce made from the
juice of the carcass a planked venison
steak some artichokes a ripe old camem-
bert and a bottle of their special burgundy
after that i dont care whether school keeps
or not

  cox was for going into trade he knew
of a fine schooner seized for debt that was
fairly rotting at the dock in auckland and
could be bought dirt cheap davison was
going home with the sole idea of disgrac-
ing the father who had turned him off with
a pittance to shift for himself in the colo-
nies first however he was going to have
a bit of a turn-up with some old cronies at
joe andersons in suva

  me i go to rouen said douchet
das ze place where i am betr-r-ray an

sent to noumea ze private - of ze

french government i been in dat -

tree years i find dat woman who be-
tr-r-ray me an send me dere if she is live-
she is my wife wit dese two ands i keel
her den i tak er by de troat so an i
keel her

  effingham laughed

  you fellows talk like a lot of bloated
millionaires said he when for all we
know theres about twenty dollars worth
of crooked little pearls out there to buy
pubs and schooners with there may be
no more than one of tommies square
meals all round go ahead with your fairy
tales im going to turn in

  he rolled over in the corner and went
to sleep

  none of the others slept however talk
languished they took frequent nips at the
bottle and the air was heavy with tobacco-
smoke sometimes a man drowsed par-
ticularly the corpulent davison only to
start awake with a jerk

  tom felt unusually wakeful himself but
he could not understand these men deliber-
ately fighting sleep until he became aware
of a slyness and stealthiness in the way they
were eying and appraising one another
he himself was under this uncomfortable
scrutiny as well as effingham quietly sleep-
ing jn a corner of the lanai then he under-
stood

  why he muttered the beasts are
each afraid the others are going to get ahead
of him

  he rose in disgust and went to his tent
to sleep till morning

chapter viii

dorothy has a visitor

for the first time dorothys aunt
margaret had cause to complain of
neglect on the part of her niece there
were times when she found dorothy posi-
tively unsympathetic and the good ladys 
matutinal recitals of her symptoms of the
night before were received with actual in-
difference dorothy was distraught and
little worry lines began to appear around
her eyes and mouth

  jack holloway came often and they spent
much time in close communion shortly
after his first visit a notice had appeared in
various california papers offering a reward
for information concerning the whereabouts
of matthews and later at holloways sug-
gestion in the journals of australia and the
far east

  dorothy scanned her daily mail eagerly
and hopefully till a couple of months had
gone by without result she admitted that
it was an impertinence for her to try to


adventure

communicate with matthews and really
believed she was acting purely from motives
of justice

  it was hardly probable that he would
ever care to see her again after her scathing
letter of four years before every word of
which was burned in her memory and if he
had suddenly appeared before her she would
have been at a loss to explain her recrudes-
cent interest in his welfare but she was
acting on holloways suggestion to com-
municate with tom if possible and square
herself for her consciences sake

  if he were living he would have ordered
his life anew on other lines there would
be other women one of whom had perhaps
made him happy-other scenes and other
interests

  she was prompted she believed solely
by the desire to acknowledge her fault in
having misjudged him in the same spirit
in which holloway had come to her with
his story she wondered if he would scorn
her or if he would be kind and look at
her a little reproachfully perhaps with his
honest sentimental gray eyes as he used

to do and-and-

 here dorothy would become very
wretched indeed and she and holloway
would drag her aunt protesting to the
theater and a late supper where the older
lady would have a most enjoyable time in
spite of herself and forget all about clinical
thermometers and symptoms for the
time being

  auntie said dorothy one morning at
breakfast i know the very best thing in
the world for you dr snyder spoke of it
the other day and ive been thinking it
over ever since its a sea voyage theres
a steamer leaving tomorrow for honolulu
and we have plenty of time to pack and
make the arrangements wont that be
delightful

  child cried miss gardiner startled
its impossible im too ill to travel
why i should be seasick it would be the
death of me the last time we went to

europe-

  ah but this isnt europe auntie
honolulu is the loveliest place in the world
and the pacific is very quiet it will cure
you im sure

  impossible i cant think of it dorothy

why-

  you must think of it auntie im afraid
you see i took the doctors word that it

will be the very best thing for you and
bought the tickets

  she smiled sweetly and patted her aunts
cheek as she rose from the table

  dont be fussy auntie dear think of
the palms and the sunshine and the flying-
fish and-and things im going to pack

three weeks later dorothy was
sitting on the veranda of a cottage
at waikiki when a hack drove up
and deposited at the gate a short stocky
weather-beaten man with a grizzled beard
he took a paper from his pocket and un-
folded it as he walked toward the veranda
he looked doubtfully at dorothy

  i came about this notice maam said
he is the gentleman here who put it in
the paper

  he indicated a personal notice identical
with the one matthews had seen in a sydney
paper on the mamaloa save that the ad-
dress given was that of the waikiki cottage

  i put it in myself said dorothy
come in and sit down please i am miss
gardiner

  the stocky man touched his cap and
bowed

  captain wiggins maam at your ser-
vice i thought i might ave news for you
as any one else been ere about it he in-
quired anxiously

  no there has been no one else so far
replied dorothy

  captain wiggins with a sigh of relief
settled his bulk in a wicker chair and
mopped his forehead with a bandanna hand-
kerchief

  it says ere miss that there is a re-
ward-a undred dollars it says-for in-
formation about a man named thomas
matthews now i know a man of that
name and i thought that maap es the
same

  dorothy bent forward eagerly

  was he one of the guests on the hy-
perion

  i cant say as to that miss like
enough i eard of the yper ion wreck a few
years ago at apia but i never knew
matthews to speak of it was e a kind of
a down-and-out sort of a chap-a great
and for the gin-kind of a beach-comber
like

  oh no no said dorothy her heart
sinking not that kind of a man at all
mr matthews is a gentleman
brethren of the beach



  oh as to that es a gentleman right
enough quite the toff you might say
only down on is luck ails from boston
way-arvard college and all that well
eddicated ive eard im speak of it a
fine upstanding young man when sober
only in a bad way financially as i said
tall man clean shaved with a mole on is
right cheek-and there you ave im
miss

  dorothys pulse was racing now

  it may be the same mr matthews she
said guardedly endeavoring to control her
voice where is he now

 es on an island miss a long way from
ere a pretty forsaken spot as you may
say es in my employ just at present
but where is this island how does one
get there do the steamers stop

  wiggins indulged in the ghost of a grin
 ardly that as yet miss the only
steamer as as been there that i know of is
a british cruiser the islands only just
charted and its out of the run of traffic
i ave ere- he took a slip of paper from
his pocket unfolded it and held it looking
somewhat embarrassed yet with a crafty
gleam in his eyes-the latitude and longi-
tude of the place i thought of giving it to
you if this was your mr matthews when

we ad settled-ahem--

  oh the reward to be sure

  dorothy had seen and understood the
gleam in the captains eye

  well captain wiggins some of your
description might fit the mr matthews that
i am inquiring for but it might fit many
other men too even if he is the same how
am i to verify it you are a total stranger

to me-

  as to that miss theres my mate and
the crew of my schooner theyll stand
ready to back me up they all know
matthews drunk or sober

  dorothy rose and stood leaning against
the veranda rail tapping the floor with her
foot

  i think i shall go with you to your
schooner if you will take me in your car-
riage i should like to have your mate and
crew verify your description and i can stop
at the bank and get the money for you on
the way please wait till i get my hat
they drove to town and then to the
wharf dorothy stopping on the way and
drawing from the bank a large sum of money
in gold in the cabin of the mamaloa

the mate was in the midst of a recital con-
firming the captains description of mat-
thews when wiggins suddenly struck his
forehead a violent blow with his knuckles

  god bless me he cried what an ass
i am i had clean forgot just a moment
miss

  he disappeared into his own room re-
turning presently with a small clear snap-
shot photograph it was one taken by
effingham on the way to the island it
showed a group of six men one of them
captain wiggins another barefooted in
worn pajamas whom dorothy recognized
at once as tom matthews

  she looked at the picture long and ear-
nestly in the pitiless fashion of snap-shot
photographs it accentuated the haggard
careworn expression and dissipated lines in
the faces of the subjects except for the
stolid wiggins sternly posing on his own
quarter-deck the photo showed unsparingly
a rakish tatterdemalion group of nonde-
scripts in which matthews himself appeared
without advantage

  dorothy laid the picture down with a
sigh then she opened her hand-bag and
dumped the contents on the table from
the shining heap of gold she counted out
ten ten-dollar pieces and gave them to the
captain

  thank you she said i am quite
satisfied

  leaving the rest of the gold lying before
her she fell to studying the photograph
again the heap of gold remaining on the
table was of a size to make captain wiggins
lick his lips he was looking at it as a cat
might eye a cream-jug when dorothy raised
her eyes

  captain she asked do you ever carry
passengers

  no maam said wiggins promptly
only down among the islands that is-
not regular passengers the mamaloas an
old roach-trap and dont smell any too
sweet as you may ave noticed passengers
are that fastidious

  dorothy slowly dropped the gold-pieces
a few at a time into her bag

  i didnt know of course i thought id
ask you i thought you might-for a con-
sideration

  she rose to go

  wait a moment miss said wiggins
im going to ave the cook serve some
tea


adventure

half an hour later dorothy
walked up-town toward a carriage
stand her eyes were shining and
her face was flushed with excitement

 dorothy gardiner she murmured
youre a goose you might have written
it would have answered the purpose and
oh dear what will aunt margaret say
shell think you have gone stark staring
mad

chapter ix

custodian of the pearls

lvfy eye said welsh in an awestruck
-vx voice wotaaul mates i dont
know ow you feel about it but im goin
to get drunk

  douchets nostrils were wide and his eyes
like two live coals

  pardieu hie rumbled we are r-reech
coxs smile grew more lickerish than ever
and davison stared incredulously repeat-
ing my word my word over and over
again while the kanaka boys hovered about
the group wide-eyed and curious

  the pearls lay before them in a brown
calabash a heap of beautiful gems far finer
than they had dared anticipate the un-
certainty of the pearl-fishers trade makes
it one of the most fascinating in the world
aside from the valuable shell itself every
oyster represents a potential fortune

  in a whole bed there may not be one pearl
of value in another may lie hidden a kings
ransom seldom is there a cleaning-up
without one of the extremes of disappoint-
ment or rejoicing

  none of the men was expert in the deli-
cate business of judging pearl-values but
the size and beauty of some of these spoke
eloquently for themselves there were
four indeed of a bigness and luster beyond
any they had ever seen but there were
many others for the bed had proved of
incredible richness and they ranged from
the four in a graduated scale down to a
scant handful of irregular baroques

  tom gazed with fascination at the softly
glowing heap in the calabash his chance
for rehabilitation lay before him and the
blood surged faster through his pulses the
past seemed to fall away from him and the
future to rise and welcome him so that his
dominant feeling was a longing for action
of some kind to try out his dormant muscles
and stir the kinks out of his brain psycho-

logically it was the same sensation that
prompted welshs desire to get drunk

  effingham fingered the gems coolly
enough but his eyes had an unwonted
brightness and there was a glowing hectic
spot on each cheek

  emblems of trouble said he propheti-
cally im almost sorry there are so many
if we werent such a mild-mannered gentle
flock of lambs there might be some throat-
cutting over these now that weve got
em and the suspense is over what are we
going to do with em

  wy divide em said welsh each
man his share and share and share alike
thats right and proper among gentlemen
i take it

  all agreed on that asked effingham
looking around

  they nodded

  very well how are you going to do
it whos going to set a value on them
were none of us pearl-buyers and some
ones bound to get the worst of it let al jne
coming to blows over the division every
one of you has his eye on some particular
one right now and is ready to scramble for
it to prevent some one else getting hold of it

  ha i thought so that shot went home
douchet dont look so sheepish

  he smiled satirically-

  hadnt we better talk it over

  oh rot said cox were all gentle-
men here as reddy says why not bury
them till wiggins gets back

  effingham looked at him with a sudden
contemptuous fierceness

  heres no need of any delusions about
our all being gentlemen and men of honor
the fact is were a crew of pretty hard
characters if we bury these every one
will want to know where naturally then
whats to hinder any one of us privately
digging them up and planting them some-
where else no theres only one thing to
be done

  these pearls as they stand represent
money-a lump sum money can be evenly
divided these can not let the man who
holds the balance of trust take charge of
them till they can be disposed of and an
equal division made of the money they
bring otherwise theres going to be a lot
of dissension and that means-trouble
good idea that said davison wh
draw cuts for it

  that wont do boys said effingham
brethren of the beach



emphatically i said the man who holds
the balance of trust we cant leave that
to chance we must vote for it

  this led to a prolonged and heated dis-
cussion it was quite evident that with
the exception of effingham none of the
party cared to see the pearls in the hands
of any one but himself

  if we put them in the hands of one man
as you say said cox whats to hinder
him from burying them on his own account
fat chance the rest of us would have then
i spoke of one man digging them up
and transplanting them in case we buried
them together we might never find out
who did it in this case we know the man
beforehand and if at any time he failed to
produce the pearls on demand-well i guess
wed know what to do our treasurer will
walk with his life in his hands gentlemen
to matthews the arrangement seemed
the fairest possible and he joined his argu-
ments to effinghams after some further
wrangling the plan was agreed upon they
wrote their votes on the margin of a leaf
from an old paper novel and tossed them
into the calabash but the result of the first
ballot was ludicrous tom and effingham
had each voted for the other the rest had
all voted for themselves matthews laughed
in spite of the gravity of the occasion

  votes a tie said he come again
gentlemen

  one moment said effingham mildly
almost pleadingly dont think i want
to do all of the talking but i do want one
word before we vote again of course this
will be easily settled in the long run the
only idea is to keep the pearls together in
safe hands so there will be no jawing and
rowing over them

  the only way is to have the most
capable man in charge he has got to keep
a clear head and be ready to fight some
discontented idiot at any time to protect
his trust any one of us can put up a
fight i guess and any one of us can let the
gin alone- he looked hard at cox and
davison-but my candidate is tom mat-
thews because he can do both as well as
any of us and being a sort of new chum on
the beach is probably a little more trust-
worthy than the rest of us thats all
this time there were two votes for tom
against one for every one but cox the
irresolute and timid member had dodged
the responsibility in favor of tom there

was a snarl from douchet and a curse from
welsh as the result was announced and cox
cringed a trifle looking dubious as if he half-
regretted his choice but there was no fur-
ther demonstration though as tom made
the pearls into a temporary packet he was
watched hungrily by several pairs of eyes
and a little thrill ran up and down his spine

   he had anticipated trouble and now if it
came he would be the storm-center but the
sense of responsibility fired him with new
self-confidence and determination it was
he felt the first move in his rehabilitation
it satisfied in a measure his craving for
action with the feel of the pearls against
his skin the world seemed once more a very
good one to live in and with a light heart
he set about making an oilskin pouch for
the gems

they gathered in the lanai to cele-
brate the holiday in the proper
spirit it was the first day since
their arrival that they actually shirked
work but all thought of labor was put aside
they were bursting with animal spirits
they ransacked their supplies for the few
luxuries in store

  they shot plover on the reef and the
kanakas gathered fish ti-root and plan-
tains which they cooked in an imu under-
ground davison resurrected the guitar and
concertina and extracted weird melody un-
reproached and having feasted they lav
about at ease

  -love us said welsh leaning back

luxuriously and puffing at a black moldy
manila cigar but its good to be rich
and tyke it heasy after sweatin the way
we ave for a few shillins from that bloke
wiggins no more o that for me

  i feel the same reddy said tom
busily stitching at his pouch but it seen-
to me we oughtnt to quit in the first
place well rot for want of something to do
and in the second if we havent a cargo for
the old man he may suspect something and
turn rusty

   if he does said davison plucking lan-
guidly at the guitar he can jolly well go

to the-for all of me

  thats all well enough said tom but
we want a passage somewhere and the only
way to get it is to keep on the right side of
the old man

  what we care for dat said douchet
with heat if dat leetle peeg mak


adventure

troub we tak away his schooner-wat
we leave weegins wid de birds or maybe
cut is troat

  oh were not a pack of bloody pirates
said cox what we want is to get safely
away with the pearls still weve earned a
good loaf why not keep the kanakas at
the guano they can finish the job in a
couple of weeks

  that wouldnt be fair to the beys
replied matthews theyve worked hard
and faithfully and theyre trusting us now
like a lot of children for a share in the
pearls what do you think walt

  he turned to effingham who was leaving
for his tent

  to tell the truth tommie said he
lazily i dont give a hang one way or the
other good night

  tom emptied the pearls into the com-
pleted pouch and hung it round his neck
by a strand of coconut fibre

  well said he i admit im rather keen
for a spell of loafing myself its under-
stood then that weve thrown up wiggins
job

  no one answered four pairs of eyes
were focused on the pouch hanging from
his neck while none of those eyes red and
watery from drink held any actual hos-
tility toward himself they had a common
expression of avarice and in that glance he
read the full responsibility of his steward-
ship it weighed heavily on him and he
passed a restless night

  once or twice he fancied he heard whis-
pering outside his tent and on one occasion
he rose and peered out the last quarter
of the old moon was near the horizon and
by its light he saw near by a dark figure
approaching he found it was joey seated
on the ground a rifle across his knees

  why joey said he what are you
doing here

  epihama effingham speak me come
replied joey simply

  tom retired without questioning the boy
further but the incident gave him fresh
food for reflection why had effingham
done this without consulting him was
this a guarclover him or was effingham
too suspicious

  the next morning he walked over to the
windward side of the island to be alone and
think the situation over his trusteeship
was beginning to be onerous why this
greed and distrust that he would fail to

render a just accounting was absurd his
pride fairly bristled at the thought

  effingham had forced the thing on him
with that ridiculous election and then set a
watch on him the man valued him no
more than he did the rest and the whole
pother was over a few trinkets of no more
value at the moment than so many pebbles

  he opened the pouch and looked at the
pearls ah but they were beautiful-as
beautiful as imprisoned moonlight play-
things for elves and fairies-and douchets
talons and welshs hairy paws would snatch
at them to squander in nameless debauch-
eries it seemed a pity-almost a sacrilege

  could he- tom hastily closed the
pouch and hung it round his neck

  a little more of this he muttered
and i shall be as bad as the rest

  as he rose to leave he saw a man slip from
behind a knoll fifty yards away and go slid-
ing back under cover like some little jungle
creature it was douchet

  when he arrived at the lanai a card game
was just beginning and he took a hand
after an hour or so of play effingham who
appeared quite ill had a severe coughing
spell and wandered away the rest main-
tained the festival air of the day before

  though it was early forenoon they were
all in various stages of drunkenness and
their plans for spending their wealth soared
into the wildest realms of fancy they
were boisterous and boastful of shocking
episodes of the past and laughed immod-
erately at each others stories

  tom noticed however that none of the
conversation was addressed to him when
he spoke they listened in silence till he had
done as if there had grown a wall of for-
mality between them all his uneasiness
crystallized into a feeling of bitter indigna-
tion and disgust and he threw down his
hand and went in search of effingham

chapter x

told in confidence

tt e found him in a little clearing close
to where a small spring bubbled up
among the stones inland the low trees
shut out the nesting birds and the barren
bleakness of the rest of the island while
seaward the dwarf mimosa hid the beach
and the nearest view of the sea was the
surf breaking on the distant margin of the
brethren of the beach



 reef seen through the swaying trunks of the
 palms it was a favorite spot of effing-
 hams when he wished to be alone after a
 spell of illness

    he was mending a tear in the knee of a
 pair of duck trousers by drawing and insert-
 ing threads he had a scrupulous neatness
 and refinement of person and an almost
 miraculous dexterity in the use of his long
 slim hands he could do interesting and
 mysterious things with cards coins and bits
 of string make perfect splices with rope
 and bring down a drinking coconut by sev-
 ering the stem with a single cast of a sharp
 stone or a shot from his revolver in what-
 ever he did there was the same finished pre-
 cision and accuracy

    when completed the delicate darning he
 was employed with could not be told from
 the original fabric he was whistling
 through his teeth as unconcernedly as if
 pearls were the last thing in the world

    tom threw himself down beside him

    walt said he you were right about
 these-things i smell trouble

    effingham took a tiny pair of scissors
 from the hussif by his side delicately
 snipped the cloth on his knee and pulled
 the thread

   shouldnt wonder said he i suppose
 the jail-birds are a little unwholesome by
now

   they could hear laughter and hoarse
 snatches of song from the beach and pres-
 ently there rose above the other sounds a
 clear strong bell-like voice

        eternal father strong to save

        whose arm hath bound the restless wave
        who biddst the mighty ocean deep
        its own appointed limits keep

        oh hear us when we cry to thee
        for those in peril on the sea

    heard from a distance with the fat sod-
 den face of the singer hidden the stately
 hymn sounded dignified and really beautiful
 then davisons voice trailed off into tom
 bowling and finally to some obscene verses
 of the siva dance at which there was a pat-
 ting of hands keeping time and more laugh-
 ter

    the voice of an angel and the soul of a
 swine said effingham were a pretty
 hard lot tommie how do you feel about
 holding office as treasurer

   shaky replied tom the beasts are
 dissatisfied and theres bound to be a ruc-

 tion sooner or later i believe the safest
 way is to bury the things

  dont do it theyre going to want
to see them every hour or so to make sure
you have them safe and to finger them over
i wouldnt bury them if i were you

  tom plucked viciously at a tuft of grass
and llung it from him with a curse

  by gracious it makes me sick here
were all ready to fly at each others throats
over a lot of baubles from sick oysters

- the brutes what the - did you

saddle this on to me for walt

  effingham laid aside the completed gar-
ment lazily rolled a cigaret and threw him -
self back at full length

  dont be an ass tommie there are a
dozen reasons ill give you just a few
for one you are head and shoulders above
that part of the gang-thats understood
if there had been any attempt at a division
of the pearls we would have begun murder-
ing each other at once for the other mans
share not at your initiative or mine but we
would have had to take part for self-pro-
tection i dont believe you quite under-
stand yet tommie the innate villainy in a
gang of this sort

  if either welsh or frenchy had charge
of the pearls youd never see one of them
again and they would cut the throats of
cox or davison if either of those weak
brethren were in charge without turning
a hair id have assumed the responsibility
myself but there are times when im pretty
helpless tommie-coughs and hemorrhages
you know-and couldnt hold my own in a
scrap when as it is im standing back of
you in any trouble that comes along

  i suppose said tom with a touch of
bitterness that one of the ways to do that
is to stick joey outside my tent with a gun
ive been trying to get to the wherefore of
that all morning

  effingham made no reply instead he
deliberately rolled a cigaret and handed
the bag of tobacco to tom as tom held
out his hand to receive it something else
round and hard and shiny fell into his
palm he dropped the tobacco and stared
for the thing he held was the locket he had
thrown away so recklessly over a fortnight
before effingham gave the short dry
chuckle that with him passed for
laughter

  your property i believe tommie par-
don me for changing the subject


adventure

  yes its mine but how on earth-
where did you get it

  joey found jt kes a good lad joey
he brought it to me and i had an idea it was
yours joey wasnt sure because your de-
scription of it never got home he thought
you had lost a ten-dollar piece

  he sat up suddenly

  now tommie another thing i take it
that your share in these pearls means a
whole lot to you-more than a splurge at
honolulu or san francisco and then knock-
ing around this forsaken part of the universe
the rest of ybur life

  of course i mean to get square with
myself if i can i owe myself that much
and this ought to be a start in the right
direction

  i know-i know and theres usually
some reason why a decent white man hits
the beach in the first place sometimes its
booze and then again it isnt you see
tommie he continued dreamily gazing
off into space tehe game is pretty nearly
up with me my interest isnt exactly in
the pearls for not one of them will ever be
of any use to me

  tom felt a warm wave of sympathy
  dont dont say that old chap--
  effingham waved his cigaret lightly

  the bells rung for the curtain no use
talking about it said he go on tom-
mie if you care to

  it was the first time he had ever put aside
his careless half-mocking air either to give
or ask a confidence he was looking up at
the sky with his usual impersonal expres-
sion but tom saw that there was a touch
of melancholy in the thin sallow face and
something welled up within him it was a
new respect and liking a feeling of brother-
hood and kinship for the doomed man and
with it too a longing for the confidence
and support of the latent spiritual strength
in the wasting body

  he did not understand effingham and
the psychic quality of his almost uncanny
intuition and unerring judgment nor did he
comprehend the dauntless spirit that would
condescend to no weakness nor brook any
mans sympathy he did however appre-
ciate the tragic pathos of effinghams con-
dition and his inevitable fate being worked
out on this desolate island he felt the
mans magnetism and choked with un-
spoken sympathy he told finally without
leserve of the girl the disastrous cruise of

the hyperion and his plans and resolutions

  effingham listened thoughtfully smoking
an endless chain of cigarets

  why dont you go to her when youve
got straightened out and tell her the truth
about it he asked when tom had finished

  why should i said tom bitterly she
never gave me a chance in the first place
and she wouldnt believe me now no
thats over and done with ive got to
make a fresh start live down this four
years of rotten worthlessness and in time
ill forget the whole business

  youre a pretty good fellow tommie
if i do say it to your face get the gin out
of your system some decent clothes and
decent people round you and youll be a
better man and remember one axiom-the
only thing a woman worth whilg wont
tolerate in a man is weakness i dont
mean weakness from our point of view like
say drunkenness i mean a falling below
her standard whatever it happens to be
give me a light

   he lit a fresh cigaret

  its been good of you to tell me all this
and ill tell you a yam to explain what i
mean it will take but a few minutes
there was once a man i knew who came
from pretty good stock-his father was a
peer of england-and he was trained in
most of the accomplishments that go to
make up what we call a gentleman  he
was a fairly decent fellow with some
strength of character-misdirected it is true
on account of his environment among a
great many others he had one serious fault-
he was rather frail of physique

  as he had something more than ordinary
skill in various ways to make up for it and
a tolerably well-ordered brain this did not
occur to him as a fault till a certain period
in his life he was a younger son this man
very wild and a spendthrift quite unlike
his stolid beefy older brothers and in the
natural course of events he finally found
himself in shanghai drawing a quarterly
remittance from home

  he was i will not say superior to but
different from the thousands of his kind
who loaf about the clubs and saloons in a
few years he was making a great deal of
money and was besides something of a
social factor and a man of importance

  then he married she was the daughter
of an english army officer a member of the
gayer social set and it is likely that he
brethren of the beach



dazzled her at first when they were mar-
ried for she was an admirer of the rugged
athletic type of man

  that was her standard and this frail
chap would not ordinarily have appealed to
her as for him it is enough to say that
he worshiped her and was blind to a num-
ber of faults and indiscretions

  well to cut it short there came a
schooner-yacht into port the captain and
owner was a great handsome brute of a
creature full of masculine magnetism and
about as thorough-paced a scoundrel as ever
walked a deck his record became public
afterward he entertained lavishly aboard
and there were always card games and
women in evidence the fellow became a
kind of fad with a certain element and the
man im telling you of often visited aboard
with his wife

  one night he was one of a party selected
for the cheap form of swindle by which the
yachtsman lived and after the drinks had
circulated freely a round of cold hands was
dealt for the purpose of fleecing the guests
the frail man-who knew all about manipu-
lating cards-detected the thing at once
and exposed it on the spot

  now there are two things that belong
with the story one is that the man had
developed something the matter with his
lungs and was more frail than ever and the
other that his wife had often been aboard
the yacht alone ostensibly as a guest of the
women it is well to remember too that
the man had seen a good many of the high
ideals he had clung to toppled over a
man  not as exacting in the matter of
standards as a woman

  there was an uproar in the yachts
cabin the yachtsman owned to the
attempted swindle but he proceeded to
beat the frail man who had no weapons fit
to defend himself with to within an inch
of his life so that he was carried ashore
insensible the next morning the yacht
was gone and the mans wife with it

  now this chap wasnt one who would try
to hold a woman against her will nor set
any obstacle in her way if she loved another
man who cared for her and did the fair
thing but a year later he got a letter from
her from melbourne where she had been
deserted before he could get help to her
she starved to death thats all its a
pretty sordid story

  effingham sat up and threw away his

cigaret-stub he had told the story with-
out a trace of emotion

  br-r-rgh im as shaky as a leaf if
i dont take a few drinks i shall have a
coughing fit

  but what did you-what did the man
do asked tom

  nothing much things dropped away
from him so to speak he had cared for
her enough to wish for her happiness at the
expense of his own afterward he hunted
the other man over a deal of blue water and
dry land till his business went to pot and
his money was gone

  now tommie to change the subject
this election as treasurer and guardian of
the pearls isnt going to stand they wont
have it and i only suggested it in the first
place as a respite till something better
turned up so we can look for that trouble
youve been anticipating right soon hello
i shouldnt wonder if this is it

a friendly game

a little group was approaching
led by welshand douchet behind
came the two remittance-men their arms
lovingly twined about each others necks
in one hand cox brandished a half-emptied
gin-bcttle douchets small white teeth
were bared in a coyote-like snarl

  welshs eyes were bloodshot and his face
flushed a deep red he beamed boozily
upon tom and effingham with an expansive
grin that was meant to appear affable but
there was a furtive self-conscious air about
the big man that was perfectly transparent

  mate said he to tom as they seated
themselves weve ad a bit of a cornference
about these votes yesterday and wants to
talk it over no ard feelins o course
suppose we all as a drink first

  cox passed the bottle which was soon
emptied

  well said tom outwardlv calm
what is it

  wy said welsh licking his lips it
seems like a bit too much to arsk of one man
to tyke charge of all them pearls too
much responsibility like

  yas said douchet dose pearls don
belong one man dey belong us hall
i like mine in my ands so i can feel em de
ole tam das me


adventure

   old on frenchy none o your cuttin
in you see matthews welsh continued

argumentatively its-to sit tight ere

till wiggins comes with nothin to do but
shovel guano into bags when we all ave
money as good as in the bank we fidges
an fusses an no one arf satisfied less its
you that as the swag

  wy not ave a bit o fun toparse the
time  ow says you wy divvy up the
pearls we dont care if there is a mistyke
of a few pounds in the long run well
leave the division to you so being youre
treasurer if you like an no questions
arsked then we can ave a friendly turn-
up with the cards thatll liven things up on
this forsaken roost

  tom looked from face to face and saw no
sympathy all were looking at him expec-
tantly waiting in suspense for his reply

  theres no earthly use my telling you
youre a pack of fools said he suppose
that i refuse to give them up

  welsh looked everywhere but at the
speaker as if embarrassed

  wy said he softly then therell be
just that many more for the rest of us
tom grew red to the ears then a cold
rage came over him he rose to his feet
struggling for self-control and when he
spoke his voiee was low and even

  you blackguard you bushranging
thief you dare threaten me get up on
your feet im going to fight you

  welsh looked up an expression of almost
ludicrous astonishment on his face then got
slowly to his feet he was a formidable
creature his low sloping forehead was
muscled ovejr the heavy red brows like the
farnese hercules and his great shoulder
muscles peaked up to his ears he towered
over tom a good five inches and outweighed
him by seventy-five pounds he stood for
a moment flexing his huge biceps facing
tom the look of wonder deepening on his
face

  i say tommie broke in davison cut
it old chap its a fair sportin proposition
to gamble for the bally things ive more
than half agreed with reddy and so has
cox here it aint as if we couldnt trust
you we want the fun lets be friends
and quit ragging

  effingham had been lying on his back
smiling and unmoved

  tommie said he youre outnum-
bered old man it isnt so almighty unfair

for the majority to ask a reconsideration
under the circumstances now im in favor
of a little friendly game myself so were
five to one against you hand over the
loot

  tom raged inwardly and his eyes still
blazed at welsh physically he had no
chance with the giant but he was angry
enough to have fought a mad bull he
groped in the breast of his pajamas tore
the pouch from the strand of fiber that held
it round his neck and flung it on the ground

  have it your own way you-fools

said he savagely therell be some scores
to settle over this yet

  he pearls constituting the bank
  were sorted out and placed in sev-
eral small calabashes each supposed
to hold gems of equal value the small
irregular pearls in one calabash were rated
at twenty-five cents the next grade at half
a dollar and so on in progression the
four finer gems had a calabash to them-
selves and ranked at fifty dollars apiece
the values were purely fictifious of course
and assumed for the sake of simplicity in
cashing in the chips but the arrangement
was as fair as possible

  it took some pains to arrive at all this
but in the end all were satisfied and the
wooden chips were carefully counted out
and divided equally among the sextet
the assumed value of the chips coincided
with that of the pearls and the few that
were left were carefully destroyed at effing-
hams suggestion

  effingham took the four large pearls in
the hollow of his hand and studied them
with interest three of them were a soft
smoky gray of the kind known as black
pearls the fourth was a delicate pink

  beautiful useless things said he mus-
ingly curious isnt it that most fine
gems have blood on them these four
now who knows what deviltry theyll stir
up before some fool buys them for a wo-
mans neck i think ill win these my-
self

  your deal matthews said welsh
sharply as tom cut a deuce

  tom shared in full the suppressed excite-
ment as he dealt the cards the game of
draw poker had taken a new and tre-
mendous importance each shuffle of the
cards had a bearing on his future every
hand played would be a crisis and though
brethren of the beach



his mind was centered on the cards and the
players every detail of the game and its
properties was filed away never to be for-
gotten in his subconscious memory

  the lanai was well sheltered by mimosa
on one side and the windbreak of canvas
on the other but there was a stir in the air
and the windbreak bellied and swayed while
the leaves of the flimsy roof rustled and
slatted loose in the heavy gusts the birds
had finished nesting and bustled about un-
easily ready for their long flight northward
some of them invaded the lanai and wad-
dled impudently about peering curiously at
the group of players and quite fearless

  the wind had hauled to the south and
the sun set coldly in a sea of pale yellow
the palms creaked protestingly and little
vortices of sand went spinning along the
beach the surf broke heavily on the reef
and the air was laden with the portent of
a southerly storm

  with the exception of effingham who
always in some mysterious manner managed
to clothe himself in white-duck trousers
sandals and a clean shirt they were all clad
in pajamas soiled and ragged and stained
the shiftless uniform of low latitudes every
man in his bare feet and all of them weath-
er-beaten and hard of feature behind them
squatted the kanakas born gamblers at
heart fascinated by the tensity of the game
and criticizing the play in whispers

  douchet won the first pot he played
most card games well but his gallic tem-
perament interfered with his proficiency at
poker he scooped in the chips greedily

  bad luck frenchy said cox youll
catch it later on

  you watch me an play your and the
bes you know how replied douchet with
a sneer maybe you catch somesing your-
self

  they played with varying luck for many
hours at nightfall the kanakas brought
lanterns and the game went on uninterrupt-
ed no one thought of food with the
pearls before their eyes each played a close
careful game and the taut strain of excite-
ment lasted from beginning to end there
were no songs and only such conversation
as applied to the game they were sparing
of drinks at first but toward morning their
last case of gin was broached and a bottle
placed beside each man

  when any one laughed it was high-
pitched and nervous there were several

   

sharp arguments over various plays but no
serious dispute until toward morning when
effingham having won a considerable sum
counted out fifty dollars worth of chips put
these in the calabash and took out a black
pearl which he laid beside his other chips

    ere said welsh thatll never do
 no cashin in till the gymes over

  and why not

   because wot ave we got these counters
 for well ave the ole bally business in
 a mess first thing we know

   ive played some poker but i never
heard of a rule to prevent a man cashing in
all or a part of his winnings at any stage of
the game im playing for those four pearls
reddy if i can get them but youve got
more than enough chips yourself why not
take one too

   it was a bluff on effinghams part but
 it sufficed welsh actually did at the sug-
 gestion of the superior mind exchange
 fifty dollars worth of chips for a pearl
 then effingham soon after having welshs
 hand alone against him deliberately tossed
 his pearl into the pot for a fifty-dollar
 raise welsh was obliged to meet it with his
 own pearl in order to call and effingham
 took the pot

   there was a lengthy argument at this
the contention being that it took too many
chips out of circulation and that a man
should not cash in unless he wished to with-
draw effingham settled the debate by
calmly putting back the pearls and taking
the chips

   you fellows are perfectly correct said
 he i only wanted to establish a prece-
 dent it is now understood that we play
 for chips only and that not a pearl can be
 taken till we cash in at the same time i
 consider ive won these two fairly and claim
 the privilege of exchanging chips for them
 when the game is over if i have them ive
 told you i intend to win those four-any
 objections

  no snapped douchet he was a
heavy winner deal doe cards

at dawn they were still playing
the boys now brought them food
which they ate mechanically with-
out stopping the game

  toward noon davison went broke the
long hours and strain told on his gross body
and his was no match for the clearer heads

 -	of the others he was in fact stupidly


adventure

drowsy when he played away his last few
chips and without a word he staggered
outside threw himself on the sand and was
instantly fast asleep

  cox lost his last chip at about five in the
afternoon during the last few hands he
had sat trembling his face pale and pathet-
ically drawn and when the end came he
appeared dazed plucking at his lower lip
and gazing wistfully at the pearls strangely
enough with the same fatuous smile under
his tawny sunburned mustache then he
too went sound asleep rolling over where
he sat

  at midnight he awoke and sat up blink-
ing then his roving eyes took in the situ-
ation and he clapped his hands to his fore-
head

  oh my god he cried and threw him-
self at full length his head in his arms his
whole body shaking with hysterical sobbing

  outside beyond the windbreak they
heard davisons voice mumbling as if he
were only half awake and then he began to
sing low and haltingly as if the song came
from a half-forgotten past-

          im wearing awa jean

          like the snow in a thaw jean

          im wearing awa 

to the land o the leal

  it struck matthews like a blow for the
simple scotch ballad was the favorite of
the girl at home he had never heard it
sung with the pathos and expression in the
drunken beach-combers voice he had
been playing as greedily and mercilessly as
the others at a high nervous tension and
it lifted him from the game momentarily
like a shock

  he looked at the groveling cox with a
sense of shame and pity what a ghastly
business they were about

  he was ready to flame out with a hot pro-
test against the game when he caught
effinghams gaze fixed upon him steadily
effingham was smiling slightly as if he di-
vined toms thought and his eyes shifted
meaningly to the others

  douchet was leaning forward his whole
meager soul centered on the cards in
effinghams hand waiting for the deal
the snarl on his lips was more wolfish than
ever and the man was actually quivering
with sheer cupidity

  welsh sat with his huge forearms on his
knees his hands clenched till the knuckles
showed white his heavy jaw shot forward

and his little eyes gleaming like twin sparks
under the shaggy overhanging brows

  its been a long session said effingham
want to cash in anybody

  deal said welsh roughly its a
freeze-out now ole og or none

  effingham rolled and lighted a cigaret
riffled the cards several times in his lean
sensitive fingers passed them to tom for
the cut and swiftly dealt them round
tom was well ahead of the game welsh and
douchet had nearly the same number of
chips apiece and effingham had neatly
piled in front of him counters to the exact
amount of two hundred dollars as dou-
chet picked up his cards they all saw the
exulting gleam in his eye

  nevertheless welsh shoved a handful of
chips into the pot tom looked at his hand
and counted out the requisite number to
make good ordinarily he would have
raised but douchets gleeful face and
welshs readiness made him cautious

  effingham dropped and douchet with
a gallic whoop of joy threw in four kou-
wood chips welsh studied glowering for
a while then with a deep curse made good
and tom did the same

  then effingham did a curious thing
taking his discarded hand he deliberately
tore it across twice and threw the frag-
ments over his shoulder

  cards gentlemen said he calmly

  douchet took one welsh two and tom
his voice as hoarse as a crows called for
one and picked it up with a hand shaking
like a leaf instantly welsh shoved his
whole pile forward picked up his gin bottle
and drank a full half-pint of the raw spirit

  without waiting for tom to bet douchet
with a laugh that was almost a scream
threw his own chips in and reached out
his hands like grapples ready to scoop in
the pot his eyes gloating on the calabashes
of pearls

  hold on frenchy show them down
first cried tom as he counted out chips
to close the pot

  four queens bellowed welsh

  four haces screamed douchet beat
zat you-fools

  gentlemen said tom i have a small
straight flush and laid down a flush in
hearts from the deuce to the six

  for a moment there was absolute silence
then douchet sprang up his knife in his
hand but cox reached out suddenly and
brethren of the beach



caught him by the ankle effectually tripping
him up then he rose and stamped on
douchets fingers till the frenchman
dropped the knife and finished by kicking
him heartily in the ribs

take that you-cur he cried still

sobbing hysterically cant you take
your medicine like a gentleman

welsh had risen to his knees and clutched
at tom but effingham had a heavy black
revolver in his hand

drop that reddy said he sharply

he hastily dumped the pearls together
into one calabash

here tommie take em mine too

no time to settle it now joey you go stop
tomis house see no one stealum you no
sleep take care of yourself now tommie
mind your eye im-im all in

he had no sooner spoken than a terrible
fit of coughing seized him a red foam ap-
peared on his lips and he fell over in a dead
faint

tom caught up the revolver and emptied
the pearls into the oilskin pouch

now said he theres been enough of
this foolery youve had your fun and
i hope youre all satisfied hereafter you 
let me alone all of you and dont try any
monkey tricks unless you want a taste of lead

ive won these things and im going to
hold them but if you stand off ill play
fair and more when the time comes ill
give every one of you a share try any
dirty work and you wont get it

cox had been hanging on his words as
a condemned man might listen to a reprieve

he sprang forward caught tom by the hand
and wrung it the tears falling down his
gaunt leathery cheeks

god bless you for that tommie god
bless you he cried his voice hoarse and
shaking

outside the lanai davisons voice had
risen into stronger volume

 theres nae sorrow there jean

       theres neither cauld nor care jean

       the day is aye fair

 in the land o the leal

chapter xii

night among the trees

cffingham like tom occupied one
of the tents when tom had secured
the pearls he helped joey get the sick man
to his bunk and sat with him till effingham

 recovered from his fainting spell and fell into
 normal sleep then tom went to his own
 tent and lay down

   body and brain had reached the limit
 of endurance it occurred to him that he
 ought to find a hiding-place for the pearls at
 once but he was too exhausted to make the
 effort just as he was falling asleep joey
 who had stationed himself outside with
 a rifle put his head in through the flap of
 the tent

   tomi said he i stop here outside
 maybe bimeby tired i fraid i moemoe
 sleep then i speak keola he come

   all right joey said tom drowsily
 now clear out

   and immediately he lost consciousness

   he awoke in the pitch darkness that pre-
 cedes dawn his senses tingling and alert
 he could see absolutely nothing but some-
 thing was moving inside the tent some-
 thing that breathed heavily was stealthily
 crawling toward his bunk he had taken
 the precaution to keep effinghams revolver
 strapped to his wrist by the leather thong
 and it fell naturally into his palm as he rose
 to a sitting posture

   is that you joey he called

   there was no reply instinctively he
 clutched at his breast the pearls were
 gone at the instant of discovery he fired in
 the direction of the sound and by the flash
 saw a form rising from the ground and
 a livid face with a knife in its teeth be-
 fore he could fire again he was grappling
 with a snarling rabid creature that sprang
 at him bodily and clutched his throat he
 knew it was douchet

  the man was panting with hate and
 passion and though tom was far stronger
 and heavier for a moment the frenchman
 had him at a disadvantage he stabbed
 viciously with the knife and by sheer luck
 tom parried the blow with his arm and
 caught douchet by the wrist the french-
 mans teeth sank into his other arm and
 tom staggered missed his footing and fell
 backward carrying the tent with him

   both he arid douchet were still struggling
 but they were soon involved in the folds of
 the tent and practically helpless tom
 wriggled and fought with the heavy canvas
 to free himself when he felt some one haul-
 ing at it from the outside

   presently he spun round in the folds the
 tent came away clear and he was lying on
 his back blinking at a light shining in his


adventure

eyes davison stood near holding a lan-
tern while welsh who had tom away the
tent towered over him his eyes bloodshot
and ablaze with ferocity douchet who
had tumbled sprawling out of the folds was
rising to his feet

  near by lying on its back its arms out-
spread in the form of a crucifix lay the dead
body of keola the hawaiian

  welsh fell upon tom and pinned him
down with a great paw he tore open the
tunic of his pajamas and fumbled at his
breast

  where are those pearls he roared
wot ave you done with em

  tom whose breath was clean gone made
no reply welsh sprang up caught douchet
by the hair and shook him clear of the
ground

  you french rat he cried wot the

-are you doin ere answer me that

you traitor

  i-i come for dose pearl gasped the
frenchman i come to keel im for dose
pearl

   ave you got em

  no he shoot at me an den ze -

tent come down i try to get hecm wit my
knife

  welsh tore at the frenchmans clothing
and explored his person thoroughly leaving
him nearly naked but the pearls were not
to be found

  look out reddy called davison sud-
denly for tom had risen to his feet

  the revolver still hung from his wrist by
the leather thong and he raised it and fired
point blank at welsh but his arm was
aching from douchets bite the giants
figure was merely spectral in the dancing
light of the lantern and the shot went wide
welsh reached him with a bound tore the
weapon from his grasp and struck him with
his fist full in the face

  tom did not wholly lose consciousness
he felt himself being trussed up in some
fashion and then dragged bodily along the
ground as they dragged sacks of guano
he smelled the sickish odor of trade gin
a warm liquor flooded his mouth and burned
his lips and gasping and coughing he came
to his senses

  he was sitting under a tree his back
against it his ankles were bound together
and his arms hauled above his head by a
rope tied tightly around each of his thumbs

  welsh stood confronting him the ends

of the ropes which had been cast over the
limb of a tree in his hand davison with
the light was holding a gin-bottle to his
lips douchet stood by the bare knife in
his hand and in the rear cox hovered his
erubescent nose gleaming on a face as white
as chalk his smile gone for once and anx-
iety and fear in his eyes

  beyond the circle of light it was pitch
dark but far off on the horizon just barely
visible was the first thin streak of dawn
the palms creaked and bent in the strong
wind and the air was dank and sodden with
the approaching storm

  inland the birds rustled and chattered
uneasily and tom could hear from effing-
hams tent the sick mans steady tearing
cough his mind registered these impres-
sions vaguely for he was still dazed and his
arms ached horribly from the tension on
his thumbs welsh gave the ropes a jerk
stand up said he harshly

  he was drunk and swaying on his feet
a terrible figure of primitive passion and
power tom rose in response to his tug at
the rope

  matthews where are those pearls

  i dont know one of you swine who
wanted to gamble for them and lost has
stolen them

  you lie youve idden them give
them up or tell where they are if you

dont-

  he gave another pull on the rope and
tom felt exquisite anguish thrill through
his arms the monstrous injustice and
brutality of the thing filled him with blind
rage

  you-brutes he cried i tell you

theyre gone and even if i had them id see

you all to - youve stolen them-

after id promised you a share too you
can kill me you cowardly blackguards-
youre four to one if you dont ill pay
you for this

  oh i say stop this

  it was coxs voice tremulous but reso-
lute

  let that man alone hes a good
chum tommie is and hes played square
hes the only square one among us what
a cursed pack of brutes you are

  douchet turned with an oath and men-
aced him with his knife cox retreated
hurriedly

  i havent a weapon blast you said
he but im going to get one
brethren of the beach



  matthews said welsh give in tell
where the bloomin things are and well
whack up again ive nothing against you
man but that story of whackin up when
youre good an ready while we stands
oppin from one foot to the other dont go
down you cant ave all that swag to
yourself do you squeal

  tom ground his teeth and his eves blazed
but he made no reply welsh gathered the
ropes and hauled viciously tom was
jerked almost clear of the ground every
joint from thumb to shoulder seeming to
rend apart his eyes started from his head
and the sweat broke out all over his body
the pulses in his head drummed frantically
and waves of red fluid seemed flowing over
his eyeballs there was a sudden dull
sound and as if from a blow welsh leaped
in the air then plunged headforemost into
the sand

  there was no sound of a shot nothing
had stirred apparently and excepting for
the wind in the trees it was so still that tom
could hear the ceaseless coughing of effing-
ham in ills tent the taut ropes relaxed
toms arms fell to his side quite benumbed
and he fumbled helplessly at the ropes to
release himself douchet stood facing him
for an instant with a startled expression
then snarling like a wild beast he leaped
at tom his knife in his hand his arm
raised to strike

  the blow never fell tom heard a soft
thud something like the impact of a mans
tist on a sack of meal the frenchman threw
up his arms with a gurgling cry his whole
body went limp and he collapsed in a heap
he writhed spasmodically for a moment
then lay still a heavy knife was buried in
his ribs the hilt protruding beneath his
arm

  tom with his own knife cut the ropes
from his hands and ankles sprang forward
and snatched the revolver from welshs
belt davison stood stupefied his flabby
jowls hanging and his eyes staring

  welsh rolled over and sat up he felt the
side of his head dazedly and his hand came
away covered with blood something had
shattered and torn the cartilage of his ear
he got to his feet unsteadily-to find tom
confronting him with the revolver

  hold hard there welsh not a move or
youll never make another the tables are
turned you see

  welsh looked stupidly at his bloody hand

then about him till his eye caught the body
of douchet

  so they are said he youve done
for that chap es good an dead e is
but wot it me

  cox came running up with a rifle when
he saw the situation he stared and gaped in
bewilderment

  why whats all this i thought-
i say tommie good for you davie you
-scoundrel what do you mean by stand-
ing in with those blackguards havent
you a rag of honor left why couldnt you
take tommies word now youve ruined
the lot of us

  davison stood sullenly holding the lan-
tern and looking down and made no reply

  dont be too sure of that cox said
matthews wait till the pearls turn up
this is only the beginning of this business
as for you davison i esteem you as what
cox said you are youre mean and con-
temptible enough- knows but youre

a poor figure as a ruffian id have been
white to you man as it is ill pay you in full
for your part in this

  so be it said davison sulkily tugging
at his mustache by gad sir its easy for
you to talk standing there with a gun at
our heads and it was easy enough for you
to promise things with your blasted cock-of-
the-walk air and supercilious manner after
winning all the pearls the rest of us are
ruined men i havent a-rag of con-
science left but by gad id rather steal
from you outright than stand around wait-
ing for you to dole out largess

  welsh stood with his hand to his shat-
tered ear but his big body was set and his
eyes alert for any advantage tom kept
the revolver moving from him to davison
his finger on the trigger

  by george said he if i were like you
two id kill you both in your tracks un-
fortunately i have a prejudice against cold-
blooded murder one of you probably
douchet killed keola and one of you stole
the pearls you strung me up here when
you were three to one-cox wasnt in that
i believe youre two to one now and
youll never have another chance ill be
ready for you next time

  it was daybreak and yellow streaks were
shooting up from the eastern rim of the
sea struggling through layers of sullen
clouds joey came running up out of
breath


adventure

   ehipi ship he cried excitedly e-
 hipi come

chapter xiii

commodore frawley arrives

he four men looked at one another

  my - said welsh its old

 man wiggins an weve left all that shell on
 the bloomin beach if wiggins sees it
 ell leave us all ere to rot less e gets is
 ands on the pearls

 they ran toward the beach and followed
it past the dwellings and the neglected
shell to the low hill where effingham stood
looking through the telescope the wind-
rack was flying low the sea was dotted
with whitecaps and to the southward the
horizon was blurred with a dingy brown
like a pall of smoke

   off the eastern end of the island not
 more than five miles away a schooner
 under full sail was bearing down to the
 anchorage that it was not their own ship
 they saw at a glance for the mamaloa
 carried square foretopsails and this was a
 straight fore-and-after moreover she was
 clean and white with none of the dingy
  look of a trader

   what do you make of her walt asked
 tom anxiously

   nothing definite effingham replied
 ive a shrewd guess though whether
 im right or not you can mark one thing-
 that schooner is not here on a pleasure
 trip

   whats the guess old man

   effingham closed the telescope with a
snap

   have you ever heard he asked of a
 man called commodore frawley

  frawley said tom why hes the
other man who applied for the charter
isnt he

  the same the man who applied for
and in all probability has it at any rate
his coming means one thing-trouble
short sharp and sudden especially when he
sees all that shell lying around loose
nows the time to bury those pearls of
yours tom

   i would if i had them to bury they
were stolen from me last night

  what stolen

   they were stolen by some one who will
 answer for it later unless it was douchet
 who is lying dead up there under the trees

reddy the bushranger took a fancy to
string me up by the thumbs a while ago
effingham for what reason the lord only
knows as the pearls were already gone
there was some shooting and i wonder
you didnt hear the racket

  you can lie all you want about the
pearls matthews said welsh grimly
but youd ave been strung up proper if i
adnt got that crack on the ead

  effingham opened the telescope and
took another look at the schooner

  i did hear a shindy of some kind
said he but i was too used up to take
much interest i saw that your tent was
down though and that somebody had
knifed keola

  he closed the telescope again and faced
them tom saw that there was a change
in the man his languidly careless air was
gone and his face was set with deep pur-
poseful lines

  those cursed pearls said he were
bound to make strife and trouble theyll
probably turn up later and lead to more
battle murder and sudden death just
now theres other important business on
hand and we had better stand together till
its over theres about one chance in a
hundred that that schooner isnt coming
here heeled for trouble whether its frawley
or not it may be necessary to put up a
fight

  wot are we goin to fight with asked
welsh

  it was a problem indeed if the visitors
were well armed which was almost a fore-
gone conclusion every man on the island
had a knife but the only other armament
was a pin-fire shotgun a couple of rifles
one of them an old needle-gun such as the
german firm supplied for trade-about as
dangerous to the man who fired it as to any
one else-and three revolvers

  we havent much of an arsenal said
tom some of us ought to keep under
cover with it in that way well have the
drop on them which will be that much ad-
vantage if it comes to a scrap the rest
can be the reception committee

  thats good generalship said effing-
ham if they are overhasty though
they may cut up rough with that com-
mittee

  ill take that end of it said tom

  me too said welsh im not much
on the shoot and if it comes to narstiness
brethren of the beach



id rather get these two fins on the man that
tries it

  walter said tom as they hurried to
get together the guns and ammunition
who killed douchet they think it was i
but it wasnt and what the deuce was it
that bowled welsh over if i hadnt
heard you coughing all the time over in
your tent id think you had a hand in it

  my cough was pretty bad replied
effingham i wasnt capable of much
damage last night perhaps joey knows
something hed be very sore on some one
about keola you know the boys were
great friends	

  the schooner came on in a smother of
foam and luffed in the little bay with a great
snapping of sail and creaking of blocks
a boat put off at once and as it grounded
half a dozen men leaped out and ran it up
on the beach

  the man who had wielded the nineteen-
foot steering-oar stepped ashore halting a
moment to light the stub of a cigar which
he held clenched in his strong teeth he
was tall and very broad and powerful of
physique his forehead was wide the hair
gray about the temples and his eyes deep-
sunken and of a cold steely blue he wore
white duck trousers canvas shoes carefully
pipe-clayed and a blue serge jacket

  he glanced about him shrewdly with a
masterful air of self-possession tom stood
with folded arms leaning against the door-
way of a hut talking to effingham as the
man stepped ashore effingham gripped his
ajm his fingers like steel bands

  thats the man said he in a tense
whisper thats commodore frawley

  tom surveyed the visitor with interest as
he walked toward him on the beach he
was a man whose name had supplied elabo-
rate material for gossip in various parts of
the world the black sheep of an excellent
family who had long since repudiated him
he had led a wayward and checkered exist-
ence as a sailor on the great lakes news-
paper man card-sharp and swindler and
various other forms of activity his pic-
ture adorned the rogues gallery in new
york city

  at forty-five polished suave a manly
and attractive figure he had put through his
crowning achievement which consisted in
acquiring by a partial payment one of the
finest schooner yachts in gravesend bay
and promoting a fantastic scheme for tour-

ing out-of-the-way parts of the world with a
party of writers and artists who were sup-
posed to produce material to be sold for
vast sums to newspaper syndicates and
magazines

  he organized a company to equip the
yacht with essentials and luxuries and bear
the expenses of this extraordinary cruise
which spoke well for his ability as a pro-
moter for the project was more or less
chimerical and would never have held
water under proper investigation

  once beyond the three-mile limit with
the masters papers in his pocket frawley
forgot all about the company except to
draw upon it for large sums until the com-
pany grew wary and finally withdrew its
support the artists were dropped at
near-by ports and frawley with the com-
panys money began a piratical cruise of
three years which led him around the world
and eventually to the south seas

  he had flown commodore and vice-com-
modore flags of well-known yacht clubs
regardless of the yachting register and
thus earned the title of commodore though
he had never held any executive office in
any yacht club he had been received by
virtue of letters furnished by the company
at the most exclusive clubs in the civilized
ports of the world and maintained himself
the yacht and its crew by gambling and the
promotion of numerous swindling enter-
prises he had a system of cappers
and with his own personality he found easy
prey among the gullible

  but the thing could not last at the end
of three years his doings had attained a
wide publicity and he found it impossible to
return on his tracks or make a port the
second time without finding trouble await-
ing him then the toils closed in on him
and the yacht was finally seized at auckland
under attachment and sold for more igno-
minious uses than a gentlemans cruiser

  such was the audacity of frawley that he
eventually bought the yacht for a song
through an agent and turned his undoubted
talents into the hodge-podge scramble for
dollars in the south seas

  he had promoted schemes for planting
cacao and vanilla in samoa and was the
active working member of an influential
chinese firm in canton which was inti-
mately concerned in island enterprise
they bought copra pearls and btcke-de-
vier had a small fleet of schooners in trade


adventure

and of these and other activities commo-
dore frawley was the guiding spirit in
spite of a bluff heartiness and geniality of
manner it was said thatjio way of making
a dollar was too mean or dishonorable for
his consideration

frawley came briskly along the
beach his muscular hands thrust
in the pockets of his coat puffing
at the stub of his cigar tom noted that
the crew of the whale-boat carried rifles
frawley cast a shrewd glance at the pearl-
shell round which there still clung the
awful odor of rotten oysters and sniffed
the air daintily as tom and welsh came
forward to meet him

  how are you gentlemen said he
nice place you have here but i wouldnt
recommend it as a health resort the
stink of pearl-shell is pretty poisonous not
to mention the guano

  glad to see you sir said tom menda-
ciously for want of something better
weve been wondering what wind blew
you in come up and have a peg and tell us
about it

  certainly boys said frawley im
here on official business but ill take a drink
with you weve something to talk
over

  as they found seats in the lanai on
wooden packing-boxes tom saw that the
schooner was tossing furiously at her short
cable the impending storm was at hand
and the brown mist was sweeping closer
over the sea frawleys eyes roved about
appraisingly while a kanaka boy opened
one of the last bottles of gin

  where are the others he asked

  his question was partly answered by cox
and davison strolling over from one of the
huts they were unable to restrain their
curiosity and paid no attention to toms
scowl of disapproval frawley nodded as
he poured himself a drink

  come into the circle you fellows i
want you all to hear what ive got to say
meantime heres luck and he tossed off
the drink

  boys he continued this is a mighty
lonely station i expect youre rather tired
of it eh

  wy that all depends said welsh
now to my mind this eres a cozy tight
little island like ome to me it is

  i guess we can stick it out a while

longer said tom dryly what is it
frawley

  well if thats the way you all feel i
expect ive bad news for you the fact
is i have the charter for working this
island

  the-you say this from welsh

  fact im surprized to find you fellows
here i didnt think wiggins was fool
enough to make himself liable this way
its a serious offense however thats not
your fault and as far as i can see no harm
has been done only now the jig is up and
youll have to clear  i dont believe youll
mind changing to a sweeter atmosphere
you must have had a rough time and mind
you- he swept a glance around the group
-ive every intention of being reasonable  

  tom sat twirling his untasted drink
around in his tin cup

  whats your proposition commodore
he asked without raising his eyes

  why ill tell you you fellows have
worked hard at the guano it seems and-
and getting out that shell it saves me
just that much trouble and as long as you
are paid for your labor i dont suppose it
matters whether its wiggins money or
mine then of course theres that shell
and-and the pearls did i mention that
i knew there was shell here when i applied
for the charter

  tom licked his dry lips

  go on he said

  frawley looked from face to face smiling
blandly tom sat looking steadily at the
tin cup in his hand his indignation was
turning to hard cold desperation as he
waited for the ultimatum

  i dont imagine you want to work for
me continued frawley biting hard on his
cigar and anyway i dont want you so
im willing to give you a passage to any
port i make or if you prefer it theres your
own boat a good able sea-boat and ill
outfit you with provisions

  you are to turn over to me all the pearls
you found and if theyre worth anything
ill give you five per cent of their value
and in addition pay every one of you white
men a hundred dollars gold for the work
youve done come now i call that
liberal

  welsh sprang up with an inarticulate
bellow a clubbed rifle in the hands of one
of frawleys men struck him from behind
and he fell sprawling
brethren of the beach

i

  tom tugged at the revolver in his belt
frawleys men were all on their feet their
rifles cocked and held in readiness fraw-
ley stood watching tom his hands in his
coat pockets his lips twitching with an
ironical smile

  i wouldnt try anything rash said he
suavely you might regret it my men
are ready to drill you at a word and theres
another boat-load just landing down below
id as soon shoot or hang the lot of you for
a pack of thieves as not better take my
offer under consideration

  there was a hollow cough close by
frawley said a soft silken voice
effingham stood in the doorway of the
nearest hut his elbow against the jamb
his other hand resting lightly on his hip
he appeared almost lazily calm and looked
at the commodore with his accustomed
half-mocking smile but tom saw that his
eyes were as hard as flint the smile faded
from the commodores face and tom fan-
cied that he paled slightly under the
tan

  so commodore said effingham at
your old tricks eh

  ive made myself plain said frawley
if youre one of this crew and heard me
you understand well enough

  oh i heard you lout it wasnt neces-
sary the sight of you was enough to
show that there was something dirty on
foot but its come to a show-down com-
modore do you know what i think

i	think youve-turned your last trick
  frawley laughed harshly

  efiingham youre a fool the odds are
against you

  he looked swiftly over his shoulder at the
second boats crew beaching their boat then
back at effingham tom thought it odd
the way the two men faced each other as
if there were no other actors in the drama
it was odd too that in spite of his sneering
assurance there was something anxious and
wavering about the big commodore while
effingham ill and emaciated though he was
seemed perfectly self-possessed and confi-
dent in his attitude

  you are the fool frawley ive had
you covered since you came joey the
kanaka boy has a gun trained on you right
now and joey can shoot i taught him

  but joeys not going to hurt you you
bogus commodore and swindler im going
to do it myself

  as he stepped out from the doorway his
right hand dropped from his hip and rested
lightly by his thigh there was a report
and a flash frawley had shot through the
pocket of his coat tom felt the wind of
the bullet and the pungent powder-smoke
in his nostrils

  at the same instant something spun by
him in the air like a flash of light there was
an odd thudding sound the commodores
knees sagged under him and with a sobbing
oath he fell forward on his face a knife
buried in his breast

  but he had withdrawn his hand with the
revolver from his pocket and raising him-
self on his elbow he fired again effing-
ham snatched davisons revolver and fired
once and frawley collapsed stepping
quickly forward effingham deliberately
fired the remaining five charges into the
writhing body then coughing violently
with a bloody foam on his lips he fell to
his knees and then to full length beside the
body of the commodore

chapter xiv

effingham passes

xfot another man had moved now
with an oath a sailor raised his rifle
but before he could pull the trigger there
was a roar and a flash within the hut and he
pitched forward shot through the head
welsh who had been merely stunned
sprang at the man nearest him wrenched
the rifle from his hands and cracked the
mans skull with a full-arm swing

 tom felt something scorching plow
through his scalp and turning saw the
man who had shot at him kneeling and
pumping in another cartridge he dropped
quickly on all fours as the man fired and
cox who had been standing behind him
spun round and fell with a bullet in his
brain tom promptly shot the sailor and
took his gun and cartridge-belt

  he turned to shoot at a man aiming at
davison but before he could do so the
latter leaped forward with surprizing agility
grasped the gun-barrel in the sailors hands
and smote his opponent on the jaw as he
staggered davison sprang upon him stab-
bing wickedly with his knife

  there were yells from the other boats
crew and the two remaining men in the
lanai took to their heels and ran toward
 

adventure

their companions joey stood in the door-
way of the hut with effinghams rifle and
took a pot-shot at the fleeing men he
missed them both but the bullet struck
one of the advancing seamen in the leg and
he fell with a shriek

  the wind had risen to a gale and with it
came torrents of rain there was the
sharp report of a small cannon from the
schooner and a moment later another
she was tossing about half-smothered with
two rags of sail flying loose

  the seamen halted when their comrades
joined them at the second report of the
schooners cannon they fired a harmless
volley into the lanai then turned and fled
toward their boats dragging the wounded
man with them

  after them roared welsh and ran
down the beach shooting as he ran

  three of the kanaka boys brave in the
enemys retreat followed him one of
them was armed with the useless fowling-
piece with which he blazed away at the
sailors as fast as he could load another had
the needle-gun and the third took effing-
hams rifle from joey who was on his knees
bending over effingham

  a sudden gust of wind tore off the roof
of the lanai and whirled it away in frag-
ments thecanvas windbreak sailing off like
a great white bird joey grasped tom by
the arm

  tomi said he epihama very sick
more better take inside

  effingham was lying with his head on his
arms a pool of blood under him there
was no wound on his body for both of
frawleys bullets had missed he was un-
conscious and breathed in long gasping
sighs together they lifted and carried him
into one of the palm-leaf shelters for the
tents were down and made him as com-
fortable as possible on a bunk

  tom could think of no other restorative
than gin and went in search of some in the
wreck of the lanai he heard firing down
the beach and then a crash of shots from
seaward davison was standing in the
driving rain watching with straining eyes

  look he cried i believe the beg-
gars have potted welsh and the boys and
by the lord harry theyre going to make
the schooner

  they caught glimpses of the boat tossed
like a cork close to the vessel somehow
her crew must have got aboard for pres-

  sdntly they saw her empty and adrift
while the schooner having slipped her
cable pointed for the open sea under her
forestaysail and a rag of foresail

  had she been less staunch and able she
would never have made it but she was a
fin-keel schooner built to eat up into the
winds eye and had won races against some
of the finest yachts in the world when oak
and teak and not buckling metal-plate
girders were the staples of yacht construc-
tion she shaved the reef by no more than
a few fathoms lying down almost flat and
a quarter of an hour later was lost to view

  welsh came reefing up the beach alone a
wild figure with a bullet wound in his cheek

  the fools he cried they would
stand there on the open beach yellin and
shootin at nothin and they potted em
from the boat the ole three are deader than
davys sow gimme a drink o that gin

  tom had found a bottle nearly full and
passed it to welsh who gulped down several
swallows then tom went to effingham
joey had been administering the polynesian
massage known as lomi-lomi effinghams
eyes were open but he was very weak and
waved away the gin his eyes looked a
question

  theyve gone said tom cleared out
with the schooner we three and welsh
and davison are all that are left walter

  effingham smiled weakly turned on his
side and soon fell asleep

  toward evening the rain ceased and
there was a temporary lull in the wind
tom found some food and took it with him
to the spring the wreck of the lanai with
the stark bodies lying in pools of water was
too gruesome a neighborhood for his nerves

  when he reviewed the events of the past
few days he was surprized to find he was not
horror-stricken he felt as if he was very
old and tired as if eons had passed since he
and his companions had come to open
hostility his nerves and brain were be-
numbed through reaction and he was so
overwhelmed with lassitude that he found
it impossible to marshal his thoughts into
any sort of sequence

effingham had been right about the
pearls wherever they might be now and
he seemed to care very little at the moment
they had had their sanguinary baptism
they had been the direct cause of the
taking-off of keola and douchet and in-
directly of the days bloody fight for that
brethren of the beach



might not have taken place had not fraw-
ley made his outrageous offer what was
to come next

  he was in no state of mind to feel regret
for cox or the kanaka boys but he shud-
dered when he recalled the icy deliberation
with which effingham had slain frawley
there was something uncanny in the cour-
age and fatal accuracy of the dying man
but for him the commodore and his crew
would have wiped them all out and it oc-
curred to tom that he owed effingham
more than this for it was plain enough
now that effingham had disabled welsh and
killed douchet just in time to save his life

  no one else had the knack of flinging a
knife with such deadly precision yet tom
would have sworn that at the exact time of
the episode he had heard effinghams
cough a hundred yards or more away

  he was so lost in thought that he did not
see joey beside him till the latter spoke

  tomi said the boy epihama speak
you come

  he followed joey to effinghams shelter
on the way he saw welsh and davison in
another shack their heads close together in
conversation

  he was shocked at the change in his
friend effingham was propped up smok-
ing a cigaret but so weak he could hardly
carry it to his lips his face was sunken
and ghastly in its pallor save for a bright
spot on each cheek when he spoke it was
in a whisper

  sit down tommie and tell joey to
clear out

tommie said he when the boy had
gone there have been strenuous times
yes old man but dont lets talk about
it till you get stronger you need rest
and quiet to put you on your feet

  never mind that its too late the
games up for me and ive got to say some
things while im able give me a drink
im as weak as a kitten

  tom poured some gin in a cup and held it
to his lips it gave the sick man temporary
strength and he continued in a stronger
voice

  dont look so glum man the strain
has used up my nerve-force and set matters
forward a day or two thats all how
about those resolutions now tommie
still in evidence

  i give it up walt too many things
have happened and ive got to get straight-

  ened out mentally never mind about

me dont talk-

  effingham raised a protesting hand

  i tell you times precious dont waste
it keep that gin handy and if i begin to
slump pour it into me now put your hand
under the mats here just by my head and
take out what you find

  tom did as directed he brought forth
a paper folded and sealed and groping
further to his astonishment a familiar
oil-skin pouch

  by jove he cried the pearls
  effingham smiled

  put that paper in your pocket said he
you are not to open it till-afterward
tommie i stole the pearls myself it was
the only thing to do under the circum-
stances i knew that if i didnt one of the
others would and they were safer with me

  you are too infernally trustful and care-
less you never were a match for those
beasts because youre too ready to trust men
who are absolutely past trusting you
think that that one touch of nature busi-
ness is latent in all of us but it isnt tom-
mie not in the south seas take douchet
for example give me a drink

  tom complied and effingham continued
it was easy enough to get the pearls
for you were as dead to the world as the
seven sleepers so i took them for safe-
keeping afterward i heard the row fol-
lowed the lynching-party and managed to
crack welsh on the ear with a lump of coral
and stick douchet at the psychological
moment id have done for welsh too
but i had only the one knife and needed
that for frenchy

  but said tom i heard you coughing
the whole blessed time down here in your
tent

  no you didnt that was joey i

made him go inside and cough like the-

i	felt a spell coming on up there behind a
palm and nearly had a fit fighting it down
it would have spoiled the whole show

  you see tommie there hasnt been a
chance from the first to play fair with these
chaps they wouldnt stand for division
and they wouldnt stand for a trusteeship
they wouldnt stand for any other man
beating them out at cards when that
kind of cussedness is so highly developed
theres no possible chance of peace

  some one had to have the lions share
somehow and i made sure that it would be


adventure

you i suppose you know that in that last
round at poker i dealt cold hands all
round

  no i didnt

  well its a fact that pair was working
up to a murderous pitch and it was the
only way to put an end to the game and rut
the agony short i was getting weaker
every minute with the cursed cough coming
on and knew id be out of the running soon
so i had to do it

  and now tommie youve got that bag
safe what are you going to do with it
dont tell me that youre going to turn
soft and let davison and welsh in after
all that has been

  tom was balancing the pouch on his
palm

  i dont know walt i owe it to you
to do as you say of course im deathly
sick of this fighting and butchery-
he shuddered-and the poor wretches
didnt have them after all though they
tried enough to get them of course i

didnt win them fairly-

  an enigmatical smile played round effing-
hams bloodless lips

  i guessed right thank fortune said he
as if to himself tommie i wash my
hands of you do as you please only
dont let them know till youre safe away
from here nows your time to bury that
pouch-deep

  at this moment davison stuck his head
in at the door and his eyes instantly
focused on the pouch in toms hand

  i-er-er-was looking for you fellows
weve got the balance of the gin together-
a couple of quarts i guess we all need
some how are you effingham

  fine said effingham

  he put a great effort into the utterance
of the single word and it sounded loud and
strong

  all right good said davison his eyes
still centered as if fascinated on the pouch
come and join us and have a peg see
you later and he vanished

  effingham lay back breathing very
faintly his eyes closed presently he
opened his eyes wearily

  the fats in the fire now son said he
weakly tommie im nearly done look
out for those chaps now you and joey
stand together hes a good boy and you
can trust him to the limit youve got to
beat those men

  walt said tom gravely itll be all
right old man you seem to have been on
hand in my interest at every turn the best
friend that ever a manhad i-i want to
tell you how i admire you and thank
you-

  he suddenly choked

  effingham feebly held out a hand as cold
as ice tom held it for a moment in his
when he released it it fell inertly effing-
hams lips moved and tom bent closer

  leave-a while tommie im tired-
so tired come back later-

  yes old man said tom and was going
softly toward the door when he heard a
loud whisper

  he returned and bent close

  tommie-that man on the yacht i told
you of-his name was frawley under-
stand commodore frawley i heard he
was after charter-you fellows talking-in
suva-thats the reason i came knew
hed be here some time looked for his
ship waiting-waiting to kill him like a dog
im quite content tommie run along
a while

  tom went out and sat on the beach a
prey to mingled emotions his body was
utterly exhausted yet his nerves were
wrought to an emotional pitch approaching
hysteria his mind was alert now to the
horror of all that had taken place the vices
laid bare the tn corpses lying unburied
and staring at the sky but most of all to
the tragic pathos of effingham with all his
fine attributes dying a wrecked and broken
thing yet quite content and unafraid

  he rose and paced to and fro for he could
not keep still his steps led him con-
tinually toward the hut and several times
he looked in at the door

  effingham was lying quiet except for a
continual fluttering of his hands the
flush on his cheeks had faded to a waxen
pallor joey stood peering in the doorway
a look of misery and concern on his brown
face and finally tom convinced that the
end had come for the fluttering hands were
still stepped within

  suddenly effingham sat bolt upright
his eyes were wide open and looking fixedly
at some point before him

  alice said he in a voice strong and
clear as if in conversation with some one at
a little distance you understand dont
you it was fair and square in the open
and man to man ive paid the score
brethren of the beach



  he fell back on the matting tom stood
a while in silence then tenderly closed the
eyes of his friend

chapter xv

the fall of a giant

the wind was still high and the air full
of salt spume flicked from the crests
of the whitecaps and flung broadcast the
sea was rough but the tail of the storm
was passing and the belated clouds were
racing overhead toward the north as if to
overtake the main body of the disturb-
ance

  tom had left joey with effingham and
gone outside feeling utterly miserable and
alone the birds agitated by the storm
were calling to each other uneasily

  there is nothing on earth which will com-
plete the sense of isolation to a lone man
like the piping of birds on a bird island he
is in the midst of creatures utterly alien and
unapproachable and in time the association
will drive him mad as it does the unfortu-
nate creatures who herd sheep

  somewhere off in the darkness davison
began to sing not a sparrow falleth but
suddenly ceased as if a hand had been
clapped over his mouth the sound smote
tom with the desire of fellowship even
with these two graceless wretches

  what was he to do they knew that he
had the pearls and if he remained aloof
would not scruple to take them from him
by any means whatever

  of the twelve men who had come to the
island there were now four left and for
every tragedy-the hastened death of
effingham and the slaying of frawley and
his men as well as the other fatalities-the
pearls were responsible

  it was inconceivable that frawley the
fastidious had come to the island to delve
for guano surely the pearls had taken
their toll and the remaining white men
must be as disgusted with strife and
butchery as he was himself

  it was time for a truce on any terms
there were pearls enough for them all and
o avoid any more discord of a violent
nature it seemed best to offer welsh and
davison a share as the only possible means
of making life bearable for the time they
must remain on this hateful island so
thinking tom fell asleep

  when he awoke it was broad daylight
the storm had blown itself out and the
sun was shining half-way to the meridian
the wind had hauled around and the trade
was back again freshening the air like wine
long lines of birds were filing off to the far
north their lines of flight spread out over
the sea like the sticks of a fan

  joey was boiling coffee over a stove made
of an old oil-tin tom asked of welsh and
davison

  i don know said joey i no see long
time now i think drunk

  tom went to the door of the hut where
they had been the night before but it was
empty several gin-bottles lay about on
the floor he had the oilskin pouch in his
hand swinging by the strand of fiber the
bright sun and the cool stimulating trade
wind had raised his spirits and he walked
on circling the wreck of the lanai with its
gruesome tenants

  he hallooed at the top of his voice several
times then from a point not far away he
heard an answering shout but saw no one
he started to walk in the direction of the
sound thinking it odd that neither of the
men appeared

  there was a sharp report his brain had
no more than time to record it for some-
thing struck him like a blast the sunlight
became utter darkness and conscious life
went out on the instant

joey was kneeling beside him
kneading sensitive parts of his
anatomy with a strong brown hand
he felt as if his head were an enormous
thing without substance yet with some-
thing beating beating upon it that caused
exquisite anguish

  he put up his hand and felt a thick band-
age that was sticky to the touch he
seemed to be burning up tormented by the
devil of thirst

  water joey said he thickly and at
once joey put a cup to his lips

  he had never tasted anything so deli-
cious joeys beautiful melancholy black
eyes were full of a tremendous concern

  tomi said he a break in his voice i
been fraid i been fraid you mate dead
i fraid stop this place all lone

  what happened

  they shoot you fall all same mate
i like kill um but they take all guns last
night no got gun left they all same


adventure

tiapolo devils now they go way take
boat take all kaukau food

  tom sat up vith a jerk

  gone he cried

  they go now fix boat they go be-
fore only too much drunk take long time
fix boat

  help me up joey

  he stood trembling for a while his knees
inclined to give way joey filled a tin cup
with hot coffee and after a time tom
gathered enough strength to walk

  welsh and davison had deliberately shot
him from ambush the bullet had struck
him over the eye and glanced off inflicting
a shocking wound that missed snuffing out
his life by the barest fraction of an inch
although they had taken the other weapons
tom found that they had overlooked his
own revolver which was still in his belt

  come on joey said he well see
about this

  their own boat was the only one left for
the one from the schooner had drifted off
in the storm it had been launched and
was riding a dozen yards from the shore
davison stood in the stern attempting to
steady it with an oar-with poor success
for he was drunk and singing at the top of
his voice tom caught the words-

        oh hear us when we cry to thee
        for those in peril on the sea

  welsh naked to the waist was wading
toward the boat with an armful of rifles
which he tossed in and returned to the
beach where he knelt and busied himself
making a bundle of small odds and ends
tom examined his revolver and assured
himself that every chamber was loaded
then cold implacable his nerves set like
steel he walked toward the kneeling giant

  davison with a shout dropped his oar
and picked up a rifle the bullet threw up
a puff of sand but tom walked on without
so much as a glance at the boat joey
threw himself on the ground and began
wriggling through the beach-grass toward
the water

  welsh started to his feet and seeing
tom stood for a moment gaping he
looked at the boat hesitated then made for
tom with a curse the weapons were
evidently all in the boat for welsh was un-
armed his enormous chest was bare and
hanging there tom saw the oilskin pouch

  davison kept up a fusillade of rifle-

bullets loading and firing as fast as he
could work the mechanism but drink and
the rocking boat spoiled his aim effectually
and the bullets did no more than plow up
the sand

  so absorbed was he in this futile marks-
manship that he did not see joey who had
reached the shore in a wide circle slip from
a point of coral rock into deep water he
was still shooting when a brown arm hooked
over the bow behind him and a lithe glisten-
ing body slid over the gunwale into the
boat

  the next instant a bare arm was twined
around his neck with a strangling grip he
gasped and struggled to free himself and
thrashing with arms and legs lost his bal-
ance his feet flew from under him and with
a splash the two bodies intertwined went
over the side

  tom held his cocked revolver at arms
length took deliberate aim at the broad
hairy chest and pulled the trigger he saw
and heard the bullet strike he saw the
blood flow but welshs jaw shut with a click
and he came on his lips drawn back from
his set yellow teeth

  again tom fired and the bullet went
home near the shoulder a third shot struck
the oilskin pouch and the flesh behind the
giant staggered his jaw was dropped now
but he came on with a gurgling bellow deep
in his throat the blood welling from his
mouth

  two more shots went home the man
was streaming blood there was a terrible
fire in his wicked little eyes and his face
was distorted with insensate passion

  something in toms nerve gave way at
the monstrous vitality of the brute and his
last shot went wild he flung the empty pis-
tol and it struck welsh full in the face but
the next instant he was seized and swung
bodily in the air above the giants head

  then he felt the great figure totter and
sway beneath him the huge muscles re-
fused to respond welsh held him aloft
poised for a moment then slowly toppled
over forward and tom fell on his back in
the soft sand it was the giants last effort

  the fall had set toms head to throbbing
again and a stream of blood escaping from
beneath the bandage ran into his eyes and
blinded him he wiped this away with his
sleeve and set the bandage as tightly as
possible welsh was lying on his face stone
dead
brethren of the beach



  joey had brought the boat to shore and
was calmly making it fast to a pole of the
boat-shed with a long rope there was no
sign of davison but out in the bay cutting
the water in uneasy circles was a procession
of long triangular fins

  tom bent over the body of welsh and
removed the packet from his neck the
bullet had snipped away a fingers breadth
of the covering and what tom saw made
him gasp with amazement he hastily
opened the pouch poured out the contents
and sat staring at them in a stupor of in-
credulous astonishment they consisted of
a double handful of smooth round pebbles

chapter xvi

effinghams messages

joey brought food from the surf-boat
and prepared a meal when they had
finished he took a pick and shovel and un-
bidden set himself industriously to digging
there was much to be done in disposing of
the dead and joey toiled through the day
with hardly a rest for he had all the poly-
nesian dread of the unburied dead at night
tom would have helped at the gruesome
task but found that the least effort set his
head to spinning and the blood flowing from
his wound

  he went to the little clearing by the spring
and threw himself at full length as efting-
ham had been wont to do the act in itself
reminded him of something-the sealed
paper that the dying man had given him the
night before he took it from his pocket
and spread it open it was a note written
with pencil in a neat delicate hand and
read as follows

my dear tommie 

  it is a thing no living man has a right to worry
about for it is going to make mighty little difference
to him but i have a particular fancy to rest in a
certain place when the gray shadows have drawn
in close for the last time and sleep comes you
know the plot of soft grass near the spring where i
have gone so often to commune with myself well
i should like to rest there and am asking you to
attend to it if things go right with you and it so
happens that you read this

  i have even taken a fancy for one particular
spot the whim of a very sick man selected during
certain morbid spells when my mind was on the
inexorable future on the round black rock over
the spring is a white patch of lichen and on a
sandalwood-tree a dozen yards away you will find
a blaze in the bark stretch a line from one to the
other and fifteen feet from the rock is the place i
have chosen

  tommie im stepping off into the dark with no
faith no creed and i am afraid no contrition
i have accomplished what i came to do and have
only a vast curiosity to see what the rest is like
yet if there are any presiding deities as we are
taught and try to believe i trust they will help and
guide you and bring you to your own

aloha walter effingham

  tom choked as he read the message then
a flood of weakness overcame him and he
lay with his face in his arms on the green
turf and sobbed like a child the letter
was characteristic not of effingham the
abandoned stoic who viewed life with a
jaundiced eye and a smile of derision with
whom he had sailed from suva but the man
he had just learned to know of purpose and
principle whose stoicism was a mere cloak
for the fine sentiment underneath

  so strong had his personality been that
in the familiar spot with the letter in his
hand tom could almost feel his presence
he carefully folded the letter and put it in
his pocket the two marks mentioned were
distinct and unmistakable and he saw
them at a glance

  he sat there for hours thinking the pulses
in his forehead throbbing and his head
aching incessantly only three days before
he had sat on this very spot arguing with
his companions about the trusteeship of the
pearls now they were all dead

  he was the last of these ill-assorted breth-
ren of the beach and he owed it to effing-
ham that he was not lying stark with the
others effingham had understood he
had stood behind matthews from first to
last and tom owed him not only life but
fortune

  but why had effingham given him a pack-
et of pebbles that this was a hoax tom
could not conceive it had been done with
a deep purpose and had a bearing on the
enigmatical smile of the dying man and his
remark about having guessed right

  could he with his weird intuition have
foreseen what had actually taken place
tom tried to adjust his mind to follow
effinghams intricate reasoning but it led
him nowhere he was certain however
that the pearls would turn up at the proper
time

 he sought out joey and told him of
effinghams posthumous request and to-
gether they prepared the body for burial
the pearls were not on effinghams person
nor were they to be found in the hiding-
place under the matting


adventure

 as they bore him to the spring the
shadowy smile on the dead mans lips
seemed to tom to have the same intui-
tive understanding behind it that it had in
life tom stretched the line measured off
the distance and broke the ground at the
proper place

  directly under the sod the pick struck
a tin tobacco-box tom cleared it of earth
but laid it aside until he had finished his
duty toward his friend then he sat down
by the spring and with shaking fingers
opened the box the top was stuffed with
bits of cloth but underneath glowing with
soft beautiful luster lay the pearls with
them was a slip of paper with a brief note

no 

  tommie here find your property youve
already found the pebbles of course if welsh
got you he only got pebbles for his trouble if you
got him youll find these anyway

  if youre both on earth you can divide these or
do what you please with them but youve already
learned by the time you read this that theres no
use looking for a spark of soul or even common
humanity where it can not exist its a waste of
time and sympathy and sometimes has fatal
results

  at the bottom of the box was a packet
very neatly made of an old chamois to-
bacco-bag faultlessly stitched with fine
thread in this were the four large pearls
and another note

no 

  ive tried to fix this all in decency and order so
it will work out right in the end whatever dis-
posal you make of the others these four pearls are
mine i won them fairly without having to deal
queer hands

  this is in the nature of a last will and testament
and i am bequeathing these to you tom matthews
charging you to keep them for yourself and rather
than let them pass into the hands of others on this
island to throw them into the sea

  luck and happiness tom may you come to
your own again this is my final word and dont
forget when the time comes about a woman and
a mans weakness

 captain wiggins brings a messenger

a week later tom sat kicking his heels
against the summit of the cliff over-
hanging the sea on the windward side of the
island tomorrow or next day at most he
and joey would put to sea they would
have gone before but tom had hung on
with a faint hope that something might turn

up he had no chart or compass and not
even a general knowledge of the distribu-
tion or distance of the inhabited islands
north of the line

  wiggins was long overdue and it was
hardly probable that he would ever return
he was not the man to sail his schooner all
the way from honolulu if frawley had the
charter for working the island for the mere
matter of taking off a handful of beach-
comber workmen still there was always
the remote chance that he might come or
that some other vessel possibly a gunboat or
cruiser would happen in and take them off

  joey and he had carefully rehearsed a
story to account for the disappearance of
the others this concerned an epidemic of
sickness following the row with frawley
and his men and tom had polished and
revised it and smoothed off the rough edges
to make it entirely plausible

  the frawley episode would have to go as
it stood frawley had actually been the
aggressor by firing the first shot and tom
would have to take a chance on that against
any story that the survivors on the schooner
might tell

  they had cleared the beach of the last
vestige of pearl-shell sinking it far out in
deep water and tom wore the pearls in
a belt around his waist there appeared
nothing further to be done except put to sea
and trust to luck somewhere to the north
tom knew was the lane of the ocean liners
once in that they had a fair chance of being
picked up

  the birds were all gone and tom missed
their noisy chattering and bustle the
silence had become ghastly and unbearable
a dozen times a day tom harked to a
fancied hail from one of his late compan-
ions and as often at night he awoke in a
cold sweat from some nightmare of murder
and violence

  without joey he thought he should have
gone mad the kanaka boy was a jewel
faithful kind and constantly cheerful
thowgh tom had often to suppress his
tendency to dwell on rather grisly polyne-
sian superstitions concerning the dead

  they leaned upon each other for support
like two children in the dark as for joey
with kanaka simplicity he had transferred
his allegiance to tom and would have fol-
lowed him cheerfully to the ends of the
earth like the faithful friday of beloved
legend
brethren of the beach

r

  a shadow fell athwart his face and tom
looked up joey tall and graceful with
a flower stuck rakishly over one ear was
standing behind him

  tomi said he pointing off to the north-
west you look tarascope i think nother
cliipi come

  tom could see nothing with his naked eye
but as he swept the horizon with the tele-
scope there suddenly fell into the object-
glass a couple of weather-beaten old square
topsails his heart leaped at the sight but
he held the glass on them a long time for
fear it might be some ship passing at
random at the end of half an hour all
doubts were settled the schooner running
free was bearing down on the island tom
sprang to his feet and grasped joeys hand

  joey you old son-of-a-gun he cried
make a noise do something man
cheer confound you thats old man
wiggins

  the schooner was bowling along with
a fair wind and a bone in her teeth but
never had a vessel seemed to crawl so
slowly over the face of the waters they
watched as long as they could in patience
from the shore and then unable to bear
the strain inactive launched the surf-boat
made sail on her and went scooting off on
a long slant to windward to meet the
schooner

  it was late afternoon before they ran
alongside and made fast under the vessels
lee sour old captain wiggins greeted tom
with more cordiality than he expected

  im glad to see you lad said he shak-
ing hands weve been wondering all the
voyage if wed find you alive and kicking
i shouldnt wonder if the men had a few
small bets on it

  on me asked tom in surprize what
for

  wiggins chuckled

  youll find out soon enough my lad
where are the others

  captain said tom gravely im
sorry to have to tell you that there are no
others joey and i are all that are left
what cried wiggins what do ye
mean man i left a dozen of ye has some
cruiser been meddling or-or- by thun-
der i have it frawleys been making ye
trouble but where are they whats been
done speak out man

  its a long yarn captain ill tell it in
the cuddy when the anchors down

  

  at this moment a woman stepped from
the companion she took a sweeping glance
at the land ahead and turned to wiggins

  why captain she said reproachfully
were nearly there and you promised to
call me when we sighted land why did
you let me sleep so long

  she looked long at the line of white
beach

  there are their houses she said but
where are they there seems to be no one
on the beach what a lonely place

  tom stood as if turned to stone either
his mind was wholly deranged or this was
the girl standing there before him on the
deck of wiggins schooner she had not
recognized him with his bandaged head his
pajamas and bearded face for a moment
he felt like sinking through the deck then
straightening up he stepped to her side
dorothy said he

  she turned to him startled and drew
back her eyes wide with astonishment
why-why- she began

  then recognition dawned in her eyes
  why its tom-tom matthews

  and the next instant she was sobbing on
his shoulder

if its all the same to you miss
gardiner said captain wiggins
as they sat at tea in the cuddy
id like to hear what matthews as to say
at once its a matter o pretty important
business and you can ave all the time you
want to talk afterward

  dorothy sat close to tom and as he
talked held his hand and kept her eyes
with a wistful expression on his face joey
had gone forward with the crew tom told
his story as firmly and convincingly as
possible anxious to get the miserable busi-
ness over and in dread of questions while
wiggins sat blowing clouds of smoke at the
skylight

  and so said he when tom had done
this man frawley claimed to ave the char-
ter did e

  he went to his room brought out a rolled
paper from a tin chart-case and spread it
on the table

  the man lied theres the charter
right there frawley may ave ad a char-
ter but if e did e made it imself the man
served time for forgery once the ole
delay about this charter was because the
british representative wasted a lot of time


adventure

lookin into frawleys record the man
deserved all e got

  wiggins went ashore in the surf-boat
tom and dorothy watching from the quar-
ter-rail then they turned and faced each
other for a long time without speaking
she looked earnestly at his drawn weather-
beaten face with its deep lines the grimly
set lips and brooding eyes all souvenirs of
his life on the beach this was not the tom
matthews she had known and cared for
but it was the one she had come many
thousand miles to find

  oh tom dear she said her eyes full
of tears it has been so long and youve
changed so but youll come away now
wont you boy-away from this awful
place

  the sooner the better said tom em-
phatically but please tell me at once the
miracle of you being here on wiggins dirty
old tub it doesnt seem real ill wake up
presently and hear the birds screaming and
find ive been dreaming

  i came to find you tom oh boy can
you ever forgive me for that horrid letter
it was too cruel-i was a fool say youll
try to forgive me tom and ill go back-
oh boy boy ive wanted to find you so
and tell you--

  tom regardless of the grinning kanaka
crew and of an embarrassed cough from the
mate took her in his arms

  but why it was dear of you to come

but you could have written you know-

  oh no no i had to tell you myself
i-i wanted to

  she dabbed at her eyes with a tiny hand-
kerchief

  jack holloway came and told me all
about that yacht tom he told the
whole truth in a way to make me thoroughly
ashamed of myself

  i saw what a self-opinionated little prig
i had been and it hurt me worse to see
myself as i really was than-than to write
that letter then i wrote again and again
to humble myself if i could but never got
an answer

  i wrote to people in honolulu then and
found you had disappeared so i had notices
put in the papers in california and china
and australia but i didnt hear from them
either till aunt margaret and i went to
honolulu where i met captain wiggins
he told me where you were and when i
found out how much he cared for money it

was easy to make him bring me as a passen-
ger and-here i am it was an impulse
tom poor aunt margaret had forgotten
she was ill and had gone off with a party to
the volcano and i actually ran away im
so glad i found you and-and you will
try to forgive me wont you tom

  tom took her in his arms again and kissctl
her well forget about that dearie
said he gravely there may be other thin-s
youll hear of that are not so easily for-
given

  the next day tom rowed dorothy ashore
in the dingey he had not slept all nighi
how long would the devotion that had led
dorothy over so many miles to find him
endure under the story he had to tell she
had come to him in his hour of loneliness and
trouble he loved her more than ever and
his heart melted at the sight of her

  he could not help but see that she loved
him more than ever and had done well in
not sending a mere self-abasing letter by
captain wiggins for it was the sight of her
and the sound of her voice that drove all
the rankling bitterness from his mind
could he afford to jeopardize any future
happiness by laying bare the horrors of
that island and the hollowness of the last
four years of his life he had argued it cut
with himself and toward morning arrived
at his decision

  he led her to the little spring he had
placed a board at the head of effinghams
grave with a carefully carved inscription
the last paragraph a paraphrase of whit-
tiers beautiful poem

to

walter effingham
a gentleman of england
this is erected in fond
memory and respect
by a friend

the shadows oer the southern sea
have deepened into night

  seated there tom told the wretched
story from beginning to end he did not
spare himself and yet somehow he did not
find the telling so hard as he had expected
the plain facts told in plain words did not
seem so degrading as he had been wont to
feel them in his morbid brooding

  when he emptied the pearls from his belt
into dorothys lap and showed her effing-
hams letters he even found himself turn-
ing aside from his own story and growing
afoot



eloquent in praise of the dead man when
he had done he sat silent for a time awaiting
her verdict she rose and stood by effing-
hams grave

  he was a strange man wasnt he she
said i should like to have known him
he was a man i am proud to have called
a friend said tom simply

  she laid her hand on his arm

  tom dear i know you are expecting me
to pass some sort of judgment on you but
i cant do it it has been a mans ordeal-
things a woman has no right to construe
or criticize i think you have been tried by
fire and i think youre fine and strong and
brave when i wrote that awful letter to
you i was angry because i thought you
weak and-and unmanly like those others
and-it hurt me so and oh tom dear it
has been so terrible here and youve suf-
fered so much and i-i sent you to it-

  she broke into hysterical sobbing

  but dorothy said tom now that
ive told you do you still care-

  she threw her arms around his neck and
nestled against his breast

  tom she said softly ive come all
this way to find you i thought it was just
to beg your forgiveness at first but it was
because i wanted you more than anything in
the world ive told you what i think and
im not fit to judge any further dont ask
me to and dont do anything but-but just
love me

  as they sat and talked tom saw the vista
of a new life opening before his eyes the
sun setting in a blazing riot of primary
colors touched the horizon and with the
haste of sunset ih the tropics seemed to slide
swiftly down behind the edge of the sea
then hand in hand they walked down to the
beach

captain meadows slapped the
teakwood rail heartily and with-
drew his hand away from the wood
with a sort of slow caress

  she understands me the old packet
he told the mate just as i understand
her weve sort of grown up together
you take this from me mister there are
some ships that have as much intelligence
as-well lets say a woman not that i
know much about women but theyd have
to be clever to beat the old euryalus

  the mate so far forgot the deference
due to an older mans opinion as to
- laugh

  steel and wood and wire thats a ship
sir you cant expect things like that to
feel anything

  the mate belonged to the younger more
materialistic school which has satisfactor-
ily abolished heaven and hell and kindred
superstitions of the middle ages

  dont agree with you ive seen this
ship do things many a human being wasnt
able to do there was that time when wed
been working through a week of fog never
a glimmer of the sun i was sure we were
in deep water and safe and i laid my course
accordingly

  the ship wouldnt answer her helm she
got as fretful as a horse refused to stay
sluggish in wearing-she was fidgety fidg-
ety tried to tell me i wasnt doing right
if ever a ship did and then one morning
we running with a strong breeze the fog
lifted a bit and there we were heading
straight in between the rocks had to club-
haul to get her clear-it was a narrow shave
if you like but the ship knew she was

standing into danger and there was

another time-

  captain meadows was elderly and some-
what prone to rather tedious reminiscences
which the mate endured with such patience
as he might but having heard these par-
ticular stories times without number he
cast about for some other subject of con-
versation since the captain appeared de-
termined to stay on deck though by all
the laws of the sea he should have been be-
low indulging in the shipmasters afternoon
nap the mate liked to express an opinion
of his own on occasion

  thats an ugly-looking beggar we
shipped at antofagasta sir he said as
meadows paused for breath not the
sort of chap youd like to meet on a dark
night in a lonely place

  he pointed with the stem of his pipe-it
was sunday afternoon-as a swarthy-faced
individual who seated on the forward end
of the starboard spare spar was diligently
washing clothes

  half a dago isnt he i wouldnt have
signed him on if thered been another man
available

  shouldnt take a man on his face value
mister and being a dago doesnt naturally
mean that a mans wrong at heart ive
knocked about the world twice or three
times as long as you and the lowest-down
swabs ive ever met have been our own
countrymen gone wrong but as i was

saying-

  he continued to reach back into ancient
history until the mate was thoroughly
wearied until he deplored his subordinate
position which compelled him to murmur


the ship remembers



agreement with the didactic old fool the
everlasting string upon which meadows
harped was the actual intelligence of his old
ship-his own property from truck to keel-
son

  id break my heart if i lost her and i
believe shed break hers if i swallowed the
anchor mister thats the real reason why
im keeping at sea-because id be sorry
for the old bakey to lose me

  mentally the mate was of opinion that
an ancient out-of-dater like meadows
would be far better ashore spending his
savings comfortably and thus leaving steps
for ambitious young men to climb he was
no sentimentalist as he was often heard to
remark and this craze of the old shippers
for attributing entirely ridiculous qualities
to a soulless fabric constructed by mens
hands-and probably not too honest at
that-was to him merely a sign and token
that the old fool was deeply sunk in his
dotage he consequently found an oppor-
tunity to discover a bit of necessary work
aloft and summoned the clothes-washer

  hi you he shouted you with the
face nip up aloft there and seize on that
topsail buntline block

  the man turned his face looked aloft
scowled and then arose leisurely with a bad
grace if there was one thing captain
meadows insisted upon aboard ship it was
implicit and rapid obedience to any com-
mand that was issued he noted the re-
luctant movements with displeasure

  when youre told to move-move he
bellowed or ill find a way to make you
get at your job

  the sailor quickened his pace mutter-
ing something about a fellow being hazed
out of mere spite and this being sunday
afternoon but his remarks were inaudible
to the pair on the poop

  insist on having your orders obeyed
smartly counseled captain meadows
i can tell you when i was mate i didnt
tell a man twice to do a thing if i lifted
my voice above a whisper things hap-
pened

  he would have said more but that the
mate made an excuse and left the poop to
go forward

  meadows looked up proudly at the piled
pyramids of canvas that were rustling
sweetly to the thrust of the good fair wind
he cast an appreciative eye along the trim
clean-swept decks that were as white as a

hounds tooth the ship this happy sab-
bath day was a picture to fill the most
critical eye and again the old man stroked
the teakwood rail

  aye lass youre a beauty eh steel
and wood and wire that shows what a
dandy young mate knows about things
you know me old girl and i know you

honest to - i think you love me as

much as i love you

  the ship curvetted a little at the moment
precisely like a horse that has been gentled
meadows strolled aft to the wheel and laid
hold of the spokes

  ill take her a bit he said get you
along and have a smoke-oh come back
in quarter of an hour

  the man lurched away groping for pipe
and matches as he went and disappeared
into the forecastle

  meadows often took the helm-it seemed
to bring him closer to his beloved ship he
possessed the same instinct that belongs to
a good horseman who always prefers to
take the reins himself rather than permit a
hireling to drive now he dallied with the
ship laughing at the quick response the
euryalus made to his demands she was
unquestionably like a living sentient thing
this day-she pretended to be skittish and
slapped a little feather of sunkissed spray
over her rail she broke away from the re-
straining grip on the vheel and fought
against the bits then she sidled regretfully
back to her course and clamored along with-
out deviating a hair from the set course

  time after time old meadows laughed at
her and with her time after time he fondled
the spokes it was very good to have a ship
you could trust and the old skipper re-
joiced in the fulness of his life at nights
he was wont to pray that when the time
came he and his ship might go together

 but able seaman royaler had other
views on that subject he was a proud-
spirited individual who had nothing what-
ever to be proud of his sole reason for
signing-on aboard the euryalus had been
to avoid trouble with the chilean police
there had been knives drawn in a tavern
brawl and a man had gone down badly
stabbed therefore able seaman royaler
lit out as quickly as he could and reached
antofagasta in the lumber-filled seldom-
used boat of a dago coasting-schooner
being compelled to stow away aboard a
stinking dago hurt his pride he strongly


adventure

resented discipline and was somewhat given
to whetting a long ugly knife which he car-
ried at his hip in deep-sea fashion as he
went aloft and performed the appointed
task he thought bitterly of the rasp in cap-
tain meadows voice

  hed better watch himself he growled
to the topsail clew im an ugly man to
get across with hell find that out if he
tries his hard-case packet tricks on with
me

  serenely unconscious of the enmity he
had aroused meadows went below after
the helmsman returned he sat down in
the saloon and lit a cigar-he belonged to
the old school that prefers cigars to ciga-
rets-and-stared pridefully round his float-
ing home his hand caressing the velvet arm
of his chair later he went to sleep

when the trouble came it came
suddenly without warning roy-
aler was at the bottom of it as was
only natural he was at the wheel and
making an indifferent job of it the ship was
steering trickily as he had been informed by
the man he relieved

  the mate paused from his steady pacing
of the weather poop to mention that he had
sailed in various ships with various men
but that he had never in all his born days
seen a ship so grossly mishandled watch
her you-you gardener he said with ad-
jectives to correspond

  you try your hand at her yourself
snarled royaler with an evil snap of his
eyes try her yourself mister there
isnt a man livin could make a better job
of steerin this old-than i can

  his particular name for the euryalus
need not be mentioned here but it was the
nadir of foulness that word reached cap-
tain meadows ears just as he hove himself
on deck through the companionway and
a curious tremulous anger possessed him
he had newly awakened from a sleep in
which he dreamed the ship had suddenly
developed an actual soul

  he stumped aft but the mate was there
before him mr bunting towered over the
recalcitrant steersman and his face went
brick red

  you give me any of your slack jaw my
man and ill rough-house you till you
dont know your wisdom teeth from break-
fast-time said bunting

  a fat lot of rougli-housing youll do

royaler coughed and his teeth showed in
an evil snarl

  all his days he had resented discipline
and when angry there was a curious black-
ish-red cloud which settled on his brain and
blinded his thinking powers it had hap-
pened similarly that day in the chilean
drink-shop it was happening now he had
boasted in the forecastle that no adjectived
officer was ever going to haze him and go
on feeling happy he had a position to
keep up because one of his messmates was
working in the mizzen rigging and overlook-
ing all that was going on

  the mate caught him by the neck and
dragged him away from the wheel as cap-
tain meadows arrived

  steady steady chirped the old man
his white beard flying in the breeze ill
show you how to handle him but by this
time the two men were wrestling together
royaler threw out a leg and tripped bunt-
ing the pair crashed to the deck captain
meadows had never lacked pluck he bent
and caught the seaman under the armpits
and lugged him upright royaler antici-
pated a joint attack and much punishment
his free hand went to his hip the long
well-sharpened blade slid in and was with-
drawn-smoking lightly with a thin red
film on its brightness

  you hound said meadows and placed
his hand on his breast

  he moved quietly away and looked at his
fingers they were red and wet then he
suddenly sat down on the planking and
groped at the deck-seams with fingers that
crooked convulsively he coughed thick-
ly and looked wonderingly at royaler who
was crouching behind the wheel with the
still reeking knife advanced

  you try it-thats all said the seaman
uglily

  that was all he said at the moment be-
cause mr bunting whipped a belaying-pin
from the rail and threw it with some small
skill it took the murderer full in the fore-
head and he collapsed as a pricked balloon
might but it was too late to help captain
meadows who without unseemly fuss rolled
over on planking that was becoming sul-
lied and quietly died stabbed clean through
the heart by a man who knew his job

  mr bunting rose to the emergency with-
out a single thought of the advantage that
accrued to himself through his seniors
death he shouted and the watch came
the ship remembers



  running the man who hd been working
  aioft slid down a backstay and ran to the
  joggling wheel the euryalus was cur-
  vetting wildly and running up into the
  wind there was a thudding of canvas aloft
  the rattle of loosened chains as if the whole
  ship were protesting against the tragedy
  that had so swiftly been staged on her decks

    tell the carpenter to bring the irons
  along said the mate and was obeyed

    the half-unconscious royaler was hand-
  cuffed securely by white-faced men who
  stared morbidly at the still figure of cap-
  tain meadows later the murderer was
  roughly conveyed to the foul-smelling fore-
  peak his hands were linked around a stout
  steel stanchion the handcuffs were fastened
  again and he was left to meditate on the
  mischance of fortune that had come his way

captain meadows was quite
 dead as the mate who had seen
 death before readily discovered
 the second mate had no opinion to offer
 but he was all for heaving royaler over-
 board there and then with a sackful of holy-
 stones lashed to his feet

    we cant do that said the mate the
  law runs at sea just as ashore but well
  keep him ironed up till we make port and
  then hand him over to the authorities
  they later sewed up meadows in a piece
  of fair white canvas and committed his
   body to the deep in the fashion of the seas
  during all this time the euryalus made no
  sign of protest whatsoever she behaved
  precisely as she had always behaved

     after the first sense of loss was over mr
  bunting commented on the fact he had
  no evil to speak of the dead but he thought
  it would lessen the weight of depression if
  he assumed a careless attitude towards the
  tragedy

    he always said that if anything hap-
  pened to him the ship would take notice of
  it and-well i couldnt quite gather what

  he was driving at but-

    why a ships just-well a ship said
  the second mate

    they carefully preserved able seaman
  royaler feeding him sparsely on flinty bis-
  cuits until the unprotesting euryalus
  reached port there the man was handed
  over to the hands of justice the trial came
  off fairly quickly and it is possible royaler
  would have been hanged but for the evi-
  dence of that man who was working in the

rigging at the time of the crime the fact
that royaler had bepn provoked was skil-
fully used by his counsel and when the
death-sentence was pronounced it was ac-
companied by a strong recommendation to
mercy later a reprieve was obtained and
royaler was escorted to a remote penal
settlement to serve the term of his natural
life

  the euryalus was sold in common with
the rest of captain meadows property and
resumed her lawful occasions afloat under
another house-flag

royaler stepped out from be-
hind a bush and leaped like a tiger
on the motorists back both lean
scarred hands encircling the astounded
mans throat he dragged him back into
the undergrowth and released one hand suf-
ficiently long to pick up an ugly ragged
stone

  when his victim was insensible the con-
vict stood up and stripped off his telltale
clothing he worked adroitly with many
glances to right and left but the yellow fog
stood his friend as it had befriended him in
the first steps of his escape

  two years of soul-killing hard labor had
definitely disgusted him with discipline
and the escape had not been nearly so diffi-
cult as he had anticipated as he stripped
the insensible motorist who had been so
thoughtful as to examine his spark-plugs
at that precise spot royaler wondered why
he hadnt made his bid for freedom long
before it only meant killing a warder
scaling a wall or two and hiding up in un-
suspected holes and watercourses

  anyway he was free now and he would
take extremely good care that he wasnt re-
captured attired in rough and well-cut
tweeds he surveyed the car

 wish to - i could drive you he

said

  but motor driving is seldom included
in the education of an able seaman and
he was reluctantly compelled to set the
thought of a daredevil flight from his mind
but this new disguise was something in the
shape of luck and the fog was thickening

  he was hungry and very thirsty and he
took advantage of the blanketing gloom to
make investigation a refreshment-basket
was forthcoming from the car but a sud-
den dull thud that might have been a shot
compelled the murderer to take more heed


adventure

to his life than to his appetite what he
had already tasted of freedom was savory
on the palate he cursed blackly as he
thought of the dreary mbnotony of personal
existence

  his principal emotion as he set off away
from the highroad with half a fowl in one
hand and a wedge of brown bread in the
other was u feeling of resentment against
captain meadows who had caused him
to commit a murder that was really
unnecessary-and in circumstances that
rendered capture a certainty royaler was
not opposed to murder as murder but
he preferred to do it under favorable
circumstances

  but in the mean time he was free-as
free as the fog that swirled and eddied
about him and during the long black
hours in his cell as during the long terrible
hours of his toiling he had planned this
escape in every detail

  the dry land was no friend to a man with
blood on his hands and his soul but the sea
was different once let him get afloat and
he would snap his fingers at all possibility
of recapture he remembered reading once
on a time the story of a man who had not
only made his escape by hiding in a ship
but who had also destroyed the entire ships
company when they discovered the mur-
derers identity

  its me for the sea-as quick as smoke
he said with his mouth full of unaccustomed
delicacies

  that was the idea either to stow away
in some vessels hold or else to sign on legi-
timately on an outward-bounder it could
be done if a man knew as much about the
undercurrents of sea-life as royaler did
true discharges were necessary as a proof
of a mans good faith but-wasnt it possi-
ble either to drug or actually knock out a
genuine sailorman who was the simplest
person in existence and acquire all his
papers and his identity

  oh no royaler had no fears on that
score now that he was free the land was
full of warnings and terrors the soughing
of a trees branches in the light wind re-
minded him of the rustling of wind in a
ships sails just as the euryfllus sails had
rustled on that day when-

  he forced himself to set that memory
aside because it created visions of old mead-
ows blank stare as he clawed at the deck-
seams and bred up a sensation as if his dia-

phragm had turned to water within him
he was not at all sorry that he had com-
mitted the crime-he was acting in self-de-
fense-and he spewed out black and bitter
curses on his victims soul but it was just
as well to try to forget the incident any-
way he had quite enough to think about
without that considering the whole coun-
tryside would be up and about in search of

him -the land anyhow let him get

afloat and hed snap his fingers at all chance
of recapture

  im not goin back to that perishin
-he said

  there was money in the clothing he had
acquired-a good sum of money but-
once again a cold chill that was not bred of
the fog assailed his inward parts-the
money wasnt any blasted use that stiff
now that hed deprived of his garments-
the anathematized police would find him
and they might get from him a description
of the clothes he was wearing at the time
of the assault

  - fool not to scupper him too

growled royaler but one things certain
there aint room enough ashore for me

  as he went along-the sailor in him en-
abling him to steer a definite course al-
though the world was blinded by the fog-
he reviewed his plans for freedom the
thing to do was to reach a seaport-a busy
one for choice-and to select a ship that
was on the point of skiling

   by midnight he reflected he could reach
rockmouth-a good place the very moral
of a place for his purpose better to wash
out that idea of snaffling another mans
papers though-no need to run too many
risks he wasnt the man to spoil the ship
for a haporth of tar not he

   avoiding roads and houses as if they were
plague-infected he succeeded in reaching
his destination without arousing suspicion
in a desperately low beer palace not far
removed from the waterside he secured a
rough-and-ready meal and sufficient rum to
warm up that chilled portion of his frame
which lay beneath his belt he also treated
the other occupant of the bar to copious
libations and on leaving borrowed his un-
known friends greatcoat and cap both of a
pronouncedly nautical cut as he left a
substantial tweed ulster and cap behind he
considered he was treating the snoring shell-
back with the utmost decency

   snugly attired exaggerating the roll of
the ship remembers



his gait with the peaked cap pulled well
down over his eyes he betook himself to the
waterside it was growing late but in cer-
tain quarters of the docks there was still a
good deal of activity men moved to and
fro the fog was thinning though fog-
horns blew weirdly from outside the port
in the nearer harbor bells clanged-much as
the prison bells had clanged across the bleak
moor after the warning gun had been fired

  royaler cursed the prison fluently as he
dragged his coat collar up about his ears
and gave a husky good-night to theconstable
at the dock-gate he breathed with greater
freedom as the officer answered his remarks
without any suggestion of suspicion ap-
parently the alarm had not yet reached
this port

  the keen scent of tide-water was good
in his nostrils as he threaded his way in
amongst the long lines of trucks that clut-
tered the many rails the electric arc
lights were blurred by the remnants of the
log and a slashing rain was commencing to
fall but such discomfort was a trifle when
compared with the other discomforts of two
years past here and there steam-winches
clattered and hissed a big steamer blew
down her boilers with a deafening clamor

  but too many people were working about
the lighted steamers-far too many there
would be officers about too-and on prin-
ciple royaler detested officers still the
stationary trucks afforded sufficient cover
and lurking behind and amongst them he
gave a careful scrutiny to the possibilities
of the situation it must be remembered
that the man was a sailor and familiar with
the fashions of ports he moved after a
while to the string-piece of a quay and
looked down at the sullen black water the
tide was making and he estimated that it
would be high water before dawn

   thats a bit of all right he said

  he looked up at the nearest steamer at
her bluff purposeful bow at her skimpy
masts that towered away into yellowish un-
certainty and saw light glint on thin wires

   curse their blarsted wirelesshe said

  that was a matter to be taken into con-
sideration though-a ship that was equipped
with wireless was a danger in itself it
was more than possible quite probable in-
deed that a general wireless alarm would
be sent out to all ships at sea instructing
those responsible for their welfare to main-
tain a vigilant lookout for an escaping crim- 

inal whose natural trade was the sea and
who might conceivably be expected to hive
back to his customary environment so
the common-sense thing to do was to avoid
a wireless-fitted ship - only the worst of it
was that practically every steamer was so
equipped in these go-ahead utilitarian days

  a wind-jammer-thats my mark said
royaler windjammers dont carry wire-
less not much they dont

  he skulked back behind the trucks as he
heard footsteps advancing and from this
cover he searched the skyline his heart
gave a leap of relief as he made out black
against the gloom the stately sparring of a
sailing-ship treading delicately and avoid-
ing the larger water-pools he made his way
toward that pleasurable sight this part of
dockland was quieter than the rest-no
night work was going on it was a per-
fectly easy matter to slink toward the mo-
tionless sailing-craft a single well-smoked
lamp burned at her gangway there was also
a glimmer of light in the forecastle scuttles
from that forecastle came a sound of maud-
lin singing and one harsh voice threatening
destruction to any who interfered with its
owner

   spite of the chill that beset him and the
spatter of driven rain royaler chuckled
there are certain sounds that can not be
mistaken by any one conversant with their
meaning this drowsing ship was due to
sail almost at once-probably with the flood
that morning

  theyve oiled themselves up pretty
well said royaler referring to the deni-
zens of the forecastle

   to his certain belief the ship had signed
on her outward-bound crew that day the
crew as was customary were instructed
to be aboard by midnight-that certainly
meant an early departure now no self-
respecting crew ever stayed overnight
aboard a windjammer in a home port if they
could avoid it on the night of arrival they
promptly got money-either from the cap-
tain or from the tailors runners who were
only too willing to advance it scenting
much ultimate gain the day after arrival
they were all paid off as owners did not be-
lieve in employing men a minute longer
than they could help therefore the argu-
ment was self-evident-the ship was due
to sail and she was a windjammer

  a blarsted miracle thats what i calls
it royaler informed himself


adventure

  with a clear line of retreat ready to be
utilized he lost something of his earlier
breathless panic and took thought to the
future it was necessary to go to sea pre-
pared for a spell of hiding sailing-ships
whilst offering many advantages also pos-
sessed disadvantages they sometimes for
instance kept their pilots aboard for days
if they met with a foul wind say and
stowaways unwanted were always sent
back ashore if discovered before the pilot
left consequently a man must supply him-
self with a sufficiency of food and this
royaler proceeded to do

  he left the docks by another gate than
that by which he had entered he affected
semi-intoxication and jocularly invited the
guarding constable who was sheltering in
his cubby-hole out of the slash of the in-
creasing rain to accompany him for a fare-
well drink

  youd best get aboard my son said
the policeman after the most cursory of
glances

  a right ole son-just goin get little
soap an matches royaler said and stum-
bled out

  a belated eating-house threw unreal
ghostly lights across the wet pavement he
entered and purchased lavishly still affect-
ing intoxication with his spoil parceled
and beneath his arm he stumbled back
whence he had come a single truck was
drawn up almost alongside the windjam-
mers gangway and from the corner of this
he watched his chance

  the singing and shouting in the forecastle
died away the night watchman anathe-
matizing the weather took a walk along the
deck and returned to the gangway

  go into the galley blarst you where
you belong grated royaler but the ships
custodian wrapped in glimmering oilskins
remained where he was until a steady
tread accompanied by splashings sounded

  royaler slipped under the truck just in
case of detection and from this conceal-
ment watched the late-comer step over the
gangway

  crew aboard watchman

  yes sir-youd ha heard em if youd
been a bit earlier

right the pilotll be along in a couple
of hours give me a shout when he comes
aye aye sir good night sir
royaler hugged himself with delight in his
amazing luck this would be the mate of

course-he sounded genially disposed and
the ship was definitely outward bound-
possibly for a three-months passage now
if only the watchman would cuddle down
for his customary snooze in the galley-

  the watchman stumped up and down the
deck a time or two until the light in the
mates cabin went out then he slipped into
the sea-kitchen hooked the door and stirred
the fire royaler waited a little longer be-
fore slipping inconspicuously aboard he
did not use the gangway-it was not really
necessary because the deep-laden ship
floated low in the water and her rail was
just about level with the string-piece he
availed himself of the braces and bumpkins
and landed on the deck without a sound

  it was very dark very very dark but he
was sailor enough to be able to find his way
about he got away from the shoreward
side as a first precaution and then groped
his way along the after-hatch that was all
securely battened down as was only to be
expected he tried the main-hatch that
also was secure but no ship least of all a
sailing-ship ever left port with all her
hatches fastened-there were spare ropes
and other gear to be stowed away at the
last minute-so the fore-hatch supplied his
needs one corner of the covering tarpau-
lins was loosely drawn over the hatch-cov-
ers and it required only a little exertion on
his part to lift the wooden plank beneath

  he slipped below and breathed deeply
as a man emerging from a dive might do
so far all was well but his concealment was
as yet far from complete also he made the
discovery that he was tired he yawned
heavily as he felt about the cargo which
only partially filled the tween-decks

  genral cargo he said touching bales
and cases and casks oughtnt to starve
here-aboard down the pump-wells though
-thats the spot

  he had himself in a previous life taken
part in the customary systematic search for
stowaways and the deeper down he got the
better he therefore wormed his way in
amongst the stacked cases and bales past
the foremast well aft until he encountered
the stout timber casing of the pump-wells
there was certain to be a loose plank-as
always-and he found it once inside the
stout box-it was nothing but a box-he
crawled about until he discovered the in-
significant hatch that led deeper and he
did not consider his work well done until he
the ship remembers



stood on the actual flooring of the lower
hold down here it was stuffy the smell
was far from pleasant but it was freedom
and security he ate a meal coiled himself
down and went to sleep

ill be hanged if i know whats
got hold of the ship said mr
friendwell shes as refractory as
a woman look at her

  he jerked his chin disgustedly in the di-
rection of the masthead

  she wont steer and she wont stay-
weve got a jonah of sorts aboard he
added

  its the loading-these rotten shore ste-
vedores dont know how to stow a ship
nowadays growled the captain its all
in the loading mister take my word for
that look at her last voyage-as sweet a
ship as ever ive handled as willing as a
horse-you couldnt make a mistake with
her once we get out into open water and
the weather takes off well alter her trim a
bit

  there was no question about it the
euryalus was behaving badly the wind
was blowing from almost dead ahead and
in the narrow waters it was necessary to
tack very frequently each time she went
about she shook herself she was lazy she
hung in irons and did everything that a ship
should not do

  the newly joined crew called her by op-
probrious names because of the extra work
required in her handling and they hinted
darkly that russian finns were amongst
the crew or else some man had failed to pay
his washerwoman that too would ac-
count for the bad weather-heavr rains
and a baffling fog together with sudden
unholy wind-squalls they growled out
prayers for a fair wind in order that now
they were away from the joys of port they
might get clear into open water which
meant easier times

  and whilst they growled and cursed and
prayed the euryalus slugged to northward
and to southward sheepishly she soured
the tempers of all aboard her and when the
full weight of the gale came away in a bois-
teroussquall that split the fore-topsail from
head-rope to foot her people were thor-
oughly wearied out so wearied indeed
that the captain coiled himself down on the
chart-room settee for a snooze and prompt-
ly sank into a slumber that might have been

deaths twin so weary that the forecastle
lookout folding his arms as he stood in the
fork of the forestay closed his eyes-just
to rest his eyelids a bit as he explained to
himself-and lost consciousness of his sur-
roundings and his responsibilities he in
common with his shipmates had lost many
valuable watches below and during the
hectic days ashore he had failed to coil away
a reserve of sleep

  the second mate who had the middle
watch folded his arms on that teakwood
rail which captain meadows deceased had
often caressed and began to think about a
girl at home

   the euryalus as if repenting of her pre-
vious fretfulness was now ramping along
in handsome style with a heartening rum-
ble of wind in her swollen canvas with a
vigorous flapping of cordage and the in-
vigorating roar of parted and broken water
all around and about

  shes bucking up thought the second
mate and yawned widely

  he determined to go and look at the com-
pass very soon but there was time enough
yet the skipper had left orders to be
called at two oclock it must mr lorri-
mer decided be getting on toward that hour
now after a while-he was perfectly cer-
tain he had been wide awake all the time-
he went to the companionway and struck
a match to look at the clock

  - he said with a dropped jaw

  the hands pointed to a quarter to four
he would probably have said more but at
that moment the euryalus ran her bows
on a submerged rock and the screech of
torn steel filled the air drowning all other
sounds

  the violent shock hurled the captain to
the floor but he leaped up like a scalded
cat and gained the open deck he was too
late to be of any real service-the euryalus
was done for that was self-evident there
were no engines to keep her butted on to
the rocks she was already sliding clear and
the gurgle of rapidly inrushing water was
added to other discomfiting sounds

   the carpenter sketchily attired in a shirt
and sea-boots with a shore-going hat
clapped on his head sounded the wells and
reported water gaining fast it was very
dark and there was a considerable amount
of sea running the wind was increasing in
violence

  the captain made the best of a bad job-
o

adventure

the ship was done for but it was his plain
duty to save his crews lives some one
would suffer for this at a later date mean-
while-

  get those boats out-smarts the word
he said the men wasted no time they
worked like men possessed but expertly
nevertheless a lead was dropped over to
leeward and a sufficient depth of water was
found the lee boats were got out there
was no time to provision them but that
was hardly necessary for the smirr of fog
lifted sufficiently to show certain vivid
shore-lights

  hands abandon ship ordered the cap-
tain and was obeyed

  the euryalus slid back a little farther
and writhed convulsively

the first shock of impact awak-
ened able seaman royaler in his
concealment in the pump wells be-
fore he was sufficiently aroused to compre-
hend what was happening-for the close
atmosphere strongly impregnated with the
heady scent of bilge-water made for deep
sleep-water was sluicing about him

  he had determined several hours ago
that the time was almost ripe for his emer-
gence from this durance-the ship was
clear of the land and making rapid head-
way to open sea but he promised himself
another few hours down there-though he
had his story all made up and ready

  he forgot the story as he felt the ship
strike again and realized a sick heel about
her he gulped as he heard the rush of in-
ward flowing water and stood up-with
water whirling about his knees

  got to get out of it -it he said

and groped about

  he believed he knew every stanchion
down there every knot-hole in the plank-
ing he had slid down one stanchion when
first he came aboard and if he swarmed up
it he would reach the trap hatch that com-
municated with the tween-decks and the
open air later

  he had however somewhat lost his bear-
ings the rush of water was confusing but
his hands closed on a stanchion and he com-
menced to swarm up it his sodden cloth-
ing proved a drag-the task was not so easy
as it had hitherto been but he persevered
and reaching the top of the stanchion felt
for the hatchway it was not there

  as he cursed below his breath the main-
mast carried away and the concussion of its
fall shook him from his holding like a fly
he descended into deeper water and then-
he screamed that water was breast-high

  madly now he searched again for a stan-
chion-the right stanchion but he had lost
his sense of direction he found one and
swarmed up it with a feeling as if a steel
band were tightening about his chest it was
the same stanchion-there was a knothole
he had felt in the deck before he shrieked
and descended-into water to his neck

  up again he went only to encounter solid
timbers above him his arms ached con-
sumedly and his brain was aflame he
gasped as terror clawed at his soul but he
was not for giving up-he fought now like
a cornered rat it was a case of climbing
up-up falling down up again-

  and then it became a case as the water
rose of clinging with numbed fingers to the
stanchion and howling out wild prayers
that he might not descend again the wa-
ter rose terribly fast-even when clinging
to the uppermost part of the stanchion it
reached his knees the quiver of the ship
shook him clear again and he was swim-
ming he was crowded up against the
beams-

the euryalus gave a frenzied
heave and tore herself clear of the
reef the sound of her sinking made
itself audible to her crew in the boats

  it might be my fancy said the second
mate who was a bit of a dreamer at the
best of times but it seemed to me as if the

-old hooker was chuckling didnt you

r todd-

  brock who was paller  cos
agent in segwanga settled him-
self more deeply and pompously
in his chair and the corners of his sensual
mouth drew down

  -when i have guests to entertain-

  he stared stonily at john todd his junior
assistant and the firefly-dotted african
darkness that lay beyond the veranda
seemed to become deeper

 -i am quite capable of entertaining

them myself-

  brock leaned forward a little as if to be
sure that john heard and understood

  -without any assistance from you

  john todd regarded brock through
sleep-heavy lids then glanced inquiringly
at the clock on the trading-agents desk
the hour was exactly  a m john was
garbedun his pajamas and he had just been
aroused from a deep and satisfying sleep by
a black house-boy-or steward as they were
designated on the niger and oil rivers
generally-and ordered to report in brocks
office at once since he was a slow thinker
at any time-something like a steam-roller
unhurried but devastatingly sure-it took
him some lengthy seconds to realize just
why brock had sent for him

  you mean to say you woke me up at this
time o night just to tell me a thing like
that

  brock reached for a tin of cigarets and
lighted one without taking his attention
away from his assistant

   john jock todd copyright  by robert simpson 

  ill wake you up he said with bloated
complacency any--time i please

  john hesitated a trading-factory on the
slave coast of west africa was not the old
familiar counting-house of maccreadie and
blacks in buchanan street glasgow and
john had not been in segwanga long enough
to appreciate the difference he had heard
that trading-agents on the oil rivers were
more autocratic than ship captains that
they treated their assistants as the most
bombastic colonel of a regiment would
never think of treating a subaltern and the
precise measure of their authority was not
yet very clear to him he would have to
think it over

  if thats all yeve got to say ill go back
to my bed he compromised dourly

  brock grunted

  thats all get out of my office

  johns long jaw became still longer he
did not quite understand brocks attitude
but he was reasonably sure that he was both
unjust and insulting and john todd had
a long memory

  just as you say

  he removed himself slowly and de-
liberately a shade under six feet raw-
boned and heavy of hand he had placid
brown eyes that looked out upon the world
over unusually high cheek-bones as un-
winkingly serious as any owls as he made
his way back to his own room which looked
out upon that sinister shroud of mystery
the bush at the back of the beach he was
rather more serious than usual


adventure

  that he was the son of jock todd of
abergowrie is of no importance except to
emphasize the fact that unlike his father
he was never called jock jock is a fighting
name it is the fiery scotch equivalent for
the more peaceful and biblical john and
as a rule though of course there are excep-
tions to prove it it is earned by those who
have made it their own

  john had no ambition in that direction
not even now however when he lay down
in bed again he did not sleep but stared
through the gauzy mosquito-curtains and
painstakingly tried to justify brocks con-
ception of discipline that was john todds
way he gave the trading-agent a scrupu-
lously fair trial before he passed judgment
upon him

  he knew that he had not interfered with
the entertainment of any guest of brocks
within the forty-eight hours since he had
arrived in segwanga and though he had
the previous evening exchanged a few words
with the skipper and chief engineer of the
cargo-boat that had brought him up-river
from forcados when they had come ashore
to take dinner with brock he could not
bring himself to consider that sufficient
grounds for being awakened after two in the
morning to be hauled over the coals for it

  as a matter of fact he had put his finger
upon brocks only reason for so amazing an
exhibition of authority brock liked to
have his assistants receive an indelible im-
pression of his importance as early in the
game as possible

  reluctantly therefore john was com-
pelled according to the evidence to reach
the conclusion that brock had acted with-
out any justification that he had been
brutal and insulting and that he was small
and had an ugly disposition having thus
decided all that was necessary to decide
about brock john fell asleep again some-
what afraid that he was not going to like
segwanga very much

entirely surrounded by the
mangrove swamps of the niger
delta which forms a part of the
more familiar slave coast and oil rivers
territory segwanga is bounded on the north
by the erstwhile ebony kingdom of benin of
most unpleasant memory on the south by
the equator on the immediate west by
a fairly broad off-shoot of the niger known
as segwanga creek and on the east from

its galley-or kitchen-stairways as far as
one cares to go by most of that part of
africa which lies between the gulf of guinea
and the indian ocean

  apart from the consulate where the gov-
ernment in the person of a district com-
missioner presided and the establishment
maintained by the foreign mission society
segwangas business in life was trade palm
oil palm-nut kernels rubber mahogany
and ivory when it could get it seven firms
had built trading-factories on the right bank
of segwanga creek just below the saganna
curve and the government and the mis-
sionary society had followed suit

  the eighth firm of traders-paller  co
of liverpool-had chosen to clear and solidi-
fy a site on the left bank of the creek farther
down than any of the others and the god
of his fathers was not good to john todd
when he sent him there

  segwanga itself-meaning the upper right
bank of the creek which he came to regard
in time as a sort of elysium-was bad
enough anywhere in the delta is bad for
the white man but the paller beach was
damned beyond redemption a sun-flayed
tornado-battered mosquito-ridden habita-
tion solidified and reclaimed from the
swamps trade did not come to the paller
factory as it did to the other seven on the
opposite side of the creek perhaps it was
really the ju-ju some people said it was
perhaps it was simply a matter of the wrong
location john was convinced after a few
weeks that it was brock or ganson or both
of them together

  brock was a heavily built sandy-haired
man with pale blue eyes thick lips and
small ears that lay closely against his head
john jock todd



  he drank much straight brandy and said
very little most of the time and when his
wrath mounted against the black man he
used a hippo-hide thong in silence his eyes
became flat then something like those of
a hooked fish and the only visible things
about him that said anything at all on these
occasions were the rippling muscles of his
powerful forearm quite evidently they en-
joyed the ugly business

  his senior assistant or shop clerk was
a diminutive cockney who answered doglike
to the name of ganson which was always
attended by an exclamation point when
brock used it ganson was a remnant at
some time in his rather misty career he had
been a promising lightweight in professional
circles but that had been several years be-
fore john todd met him what john saw
was a pasty-faced sycophantic button-eyed
little man in a frayed shirt and dirty white
drill trousers the apologetic ensemble being
crowned by a faded and battered sun-helmet
that had served as an umbrella in more than
one delta tornado

  in the shop however ganson was not
at all apologetic sweltering in the pitiless
grip of corrugated iron walls which retained
the suns terrific heat and generously passed
it on to ganson he sold everything within
the normal need of man including im-
ported coffins and distributed promiscuous
right hooks and the far-famed english jab
for the edification of such of his jakri and
sobo customers as annoyed him

  ganson was often annoyed with those
who did not know an upper-cut from a hay-
maker and the less they knew the more
annoyed he became even brock who had
seen ganson in action several times without
saying anything about it had known
moments when he had been actually
afraid of his shop clerks wickedly fast
left hand

  brock was frankly of the genus brute
ganson was just a far-off echo and the
swamps and the sun and the torpid isolation
were more deadly than either between
them they made john todd acquainted
with things that were not written in books

like every other trading-agent
on the slave coast brock was
known as the capn-a legacy from
the old trading-ship days-just as the din-
ing-room was called the saloon the floor the
deck the kitchen the galley and the clear-

ing on which the factory or trading station
was built was called the beach

  brock who had never captained anything
more nautical than an eight-oared gig-boat
but who was gifted with a truly sublime
sense of his authority and importance within
the limits of the paller beach spent most of
his time on a lounge in his office under the
beneficence of a gently swinging punka
and when the brandy bottle was empty the
punka-boy got it-if he did not duck
quickly enough

  in the tropics the majority of men drink
heavily or not at all yet brock was seldom
visibly under the influence of the brandy he
consumed he never became voluble never
lost his stride nor quickened it nor altered
in any external feature except in the deepen-
ing flush that sometimes mantled his checks
when his mood changed it did so without
haste and apparently without prejudice but
when he struck he struck cruelly and with-
out wrarning

  twice a day in keeping with the custom
of the country he came in contact with his
assistants on a footing of near-equality
that was at eleven oclock lunch and seven
oclock dinner-quite formal affairs served
in the saloon by a corps of stewards of jakri
and kroo persuasion under the direction of
a kroo-boy chief steward who was even
more glumly uncommunicative and forbid-
ding in appearance than brock himself

  not only on the paller beach but also on
the majority of niger and oil rivers trad-
ing-beaches if there is any conversation at
those meals the junior assistant is not ex-
pected to take any part in it unless the agent
condescends to address a remark to him
he is there simply to eat and to listen and
to appreciate the honor of being permitted
to be there at all the agents call it disci-
pline and enjoy themselves the assistants

call it-and vow to get even some day

but they never do they either die or be-
come agents themselves and being human
help to perpetuate the system

  john todd liked it because he did not
care to talk to brock upon any occasion the
arrangement suited him quite well and
brock knew it and bothered about it as well
as about everything john did or was or had
he did not like johns long serious face or
his brown solemn eyes or his large hands
and feet or his accent or his silence or the
way he went about his business some-
times he said so quite distinctly more often


adventure

he merely growled unintelligibly and al-
lowed his junior assistant to assume that he
was displeased

  john paid little or no attention in any
case he was paller  cos junior assistant
and in his own mind there was nothing in-
volved about what was expected of him
from  a m to  p m with a two-hour
break between eleven and one he was called
upon to sweat and to become profane if he
cared to and to give of the blessed hours of
his most fruitful years for four canned-food
meals a day and a hundred pounds per
annum

  so in strict accordance with his concep-
tion of his duty to the contract he had
signed in the liverpool office he received
the palm oil and kernels from the jakri
and sobo and i jo traders who brought
them there paid out cargo from the general
store or stores as barter for the produce he
bought kept the beach and the out-build-
ings upon it in ship-shape order and bossed
the gang of kroo-boys who did all the hard
and dirty work

  there was nothing in his contract how-
ever that said anything about brock to
him brock was just brock neither more nor
less and though john cannily admitted his
authority he did not at any time subscribe
to his method of asserting it

one morning standing on the oil
wharf beside the hand crane watch-
ing the steady stream of oil and
kernel-laden canoes passing on their way to
the up-river trading factories only a scanty
few of them coming to halt alongside
the paller beach breakwater john heard
brocks cat-like step behind him like
many big men of athletic mold brock was
swift and sure and silent of foot

  what are you standing there for brock
snapped got nothing better to do than

watch those-canoes get away from us

john turned his head surveyed brock
from under the wide green-lined rim of his
mushroom sun-helmet then said mildly-
if ye can suggest any way we can stop

them goin by maybe-

  suggest to you brock laughed and
the sound of it almost made sparks fly as it
rasped its way through the heat-heavy
morning air i dont suggest ways and
means to my assistants mr todd i tell
them what to do and they do it get off
the wharf

 just as you say johii agreed and
 walked off the wharf into the oil yard

 todd

 john stopped several kroo-boys who
 were up to their waists in slimy water and
 mud repairing the mangrove stick break-
 water on either side of the oil wharf looked up
 expectantly as brocks voice lifted suddenly

 did ye want me john inquired pla-
 cidly going toward brock again mopping
 his face and forehead

 what are those boys supposed to be
 doing the agent asked gruffly

 mendin the breakwater

 i can see that without being told who
 gave you authority to spend the firms
 money on breakwater sticks

 nobody you ordered the sticks your-
 self from chief ilori a week ago

 and you received them without my
 o k

 i did i thought that was-

 youre not here to think youre here
 to obey my orders and i gave you no orders
 to receive those sticks

 oh yes you did

 i told you to receive them without mv
 o k

 you said nothing about your o k you
john jock todd



told me to receive the sticks when they were
delivered and i did theyre good sticks
bah what do you know about sticks
good or bad

  my faither is a forrester

  oh-you and your fayther

  brock turned impatiently to walk toward
the pile of breakwater sticks but halted
abruptly and spun about when he heard
john say quietly

thats easy done with your tongue and
hurts nobody but i wouldnt advise ye at
any time to repeat it in my faithers hearin
what do you mean am  to infer that

you are-

  not that my faither needs me to defend
him john persisted with a most irritating
lack of pugnacity hes a big man up and
through and across-four inches better
than six feet-and hes not like me

  brock crossed the wharf in three strides
and stopped a foot away from john who
did not move

  are you-threatening me obviously
he hoped john was

  no man no nothing like that im
just sort o suggesting that it isnt always
wise to insult a man yeve never seen
brocks impulse was to strike because he
felt foolish-a most unusual sensation for
him on his own beach-but his hands re-
mained passive as if some force other than
mere restraint held them so perhaps it
was that he suspected that john was not
afraid of him because as he stood there
hating his assistants long serious face more
than ever knowing that he could beat it to
a pulp without a great deal of trouble and
that he would enjoy doing it he saw no trace
of fear in it-not even a sign that john
cared whether he struck or not

  with a throaty exclamation of disgust
and impatience that was intended to dismiss
john as being unworthy of any further con-
sideration he turned toward the pile of
breakwater sticks ostensibly to examine
them but actually to take out some measure
of his bottled-up wrath on the kroo-boys

  here you headman let me have
a look at those sticks edge

  the toe of his boot emphasized the order
and principally with boot and fist he made
an expert inspection of the whole pile con-
demning about a dozen to save his face

  too short any fool with half an eye
could see that throw em on one side
not there you bushman

  

  his heavy fist crashed against a luckless
kroo-boys jaw and when the boy fell
almost impaling himself upon the pointed
end of the stick he was carrying brock
kicked him till he got up again john
walked off the wharf then and went down to
the kernel store he had seen brock do th- 
same thing to ganson once and he some-
times vaguely pictured himself in a re
position but he had never taken the con-
tingency seriously enough to decide what
he would do if it happened

  ganson had done nothing snivelled a bit
and limped into the privacy of his own room
where he could become as vilely profane as
he cared to at brocks expense then went
down into the shop next morning and made
the shop-boys and their customers acquaint-
ed with a few more jabs that had even more
snap in them than usual he continued to
call brock capn and listened when the
agent spoke as if he were a god complete-
ly cowed by brocks massive cruelties he
was too much of a brute in miniature him-
self ever to have gumption enough to throw
off the yoke to john the little cockney
was just an unpleasant voice and few
dropped aitches

  in the kernel store where kernel-brown
lizards with red heads kept the place par-
tially free of flies john tried to forget both
of them it was shady and almost cool in
there and though the aroma of sweating
kernels was not the pleasantest in the world
it had the virtue of keeping brock out

  four large round twenty-eight bushel
measures-somewhat oddly called coolers-
that swung upon a frame formed a dividing
line between the stock of kernels on hand
and the receiving end of the store where
john sat upon a high stool before a higher
desk and tried to make sure that he got
what he paid for most of the time he did
because john was a canny man who was not
given to careless ways of doing business

  he was punctiliously careful for instance
that the percentage of shell adhering to the
kernels he bought did not exceed two and
one-half per cent the limit was five but
john thought half of that was better and
assured of a safe margin in that direction
his principal anxiety thereafter was to be
sure that the native trader with or without
the assistance of johns own kernel-boys
did not cheat him in the matter of the quan-
tity delivered it was a part of their un-
written creed to do so


adventure

upon a blazing monday morning
not long after the incident of the
breakwater sticks there came into
johns life a kernel-trader named dawanna
he was a sobo black as coal flat of face
full of strange gutturals and imbued with
a persistent desire to refrain from learning
to speak even pidgin english but in spite
his weakness for a simple loin-cloth in
preference to the trailing madras overcloth
which custom and his position compelled
him to wear he was one of the biggest trad-
ers in the segwanga district and when he
brought some of his trade to the paller beach
brock opened a small bottle and dawanna
sucked champagne through his filed teeth
as if it were square- face while he dick-
ered with the agent on the question of
price

  his canoes attended by his boys hugged
the breakwater waiting to discharge their
cargoes of heaped-up glossy brown kernels
and when dawanna came down from
brocks office garbed only in a loin cloth
his overcloth slung over his shoulder and
tossed an order at his boys as one throws
a bone to a dog the work began johns
four cooler measures were filled tipped
over and emptied into stock several times
that morning because dawannas business
brought smaller trade in its train and john
kept a careful tally of the number of coolers
passed in by the sobo on a pad that lay on
his desk his total when it was all over was
nineteen coolers

  dawannas figures however did not
agree with johns the sobo trader claimed
that he had delivered twenty coolers and
when john refused to believe him and fur-
ther refused to give him a book or check
for more than nineteen coolers dawanna
cursed johns house in jaw-destroying sobo
and went up to see brock about it

  whats the trouble here brock growled
in johns ear about half a minute later
while dawanna and his boys and some
small-fry bushel-traders who knew exactly
what the trouble was looked on cant
you take in a handful of kernels without
getting your feet twisted

  brocks face exhibited his dislike of john
and the smell of sweating kernels in equal
proportions and some of the greasy half-
clothed blacks round about snickered
brock wanted them to he had succeeded
that morning in buying more kernels than
he had done in a month and it had put him

into a more pompously blustering humor
than he had enjoyed in many a day

  my feet have nothing to do with it
john returned without a trace of humor
theres my tally and i stand by it

  he handed brock the pad upon his desk
and the agent distinctly saw thereon the
nineteen decisive strokes made by johns
pen each stroke representing the figure one
he saw too just how the kernels had been
delivered and dumped into stock some-
times two coolers at a time sometimes
three and once all four cooler measures had
been filled and emptied together

  must have missed one brock decided
bruskly because he could afford to and be-
cause kernel shipments when they reached
liverpool owing to shrinkage and general
loss were often short of the tonnage shipped

at segwanga make out-

  i didnt miss one john declared un-
emotionally from his high stool before the
kernel desk

  i say you did and thats enough for you

make out a book for twenty coolers-

  nineteen by my tally

  to - with your tally make out

a book for twenty coolers

  john shook his head more in sorrow than
in anger

  i cant do that

  you cant brock looked at him and
the sobo and jakri spectators looked at
brock though they did not understand
everything he said they knew from experi-
ence what was coming even quicker than
john did im running this beach and
every living soul thats on it does what i tell
him and does it quick make out that
book

  john hesitated a moment or two then
deliberately picked up his pen when he
opened the kernel check book dawanna
grinned and when he began to write brock
snorted importantly and looked about him
to emphasize the fact that he was brock

  to the native anything that is written
is a book whether it is a kernel check
a letter a shipping-mark or a volume of
keats he can not read any of them so
they all mean the same to him but he
knows the difference between the amount of
pay he receives for one cooler of kernels
and that which he gets for two which is
ample knowledge for his purposes

  john wrote dawannas book very care-
fully and presently handed it to brock who
john jock todd



had intended to glance at it perfunctorily
and turn it over to dawanna with a flourish
brock however did neither of these things
he looked twice at that kernel check and
did not hand it to dawanna at all the
check called for nineteen coolers

  im afraid thats the best i can do
john said slowly having first taken the pre-
caution to get down from his high stool on
the far side of the desk so that the desk
was between him and brock if ye want
to give him a book for another cooler on
your own responsibility thats another mat-
ter but i cant put my ineetials on it

  words sputtered upon brocks lips and
died there he knew a blank wall when he
came to it and though dawanna and his
cohorts were not aware of it he did some of
the quickest thinking he had ever done in
those few seconds as he crushed the kernel
check in his ham-like hand

  technically and strategically his position
was bad with a stub in the kernel check
book showing the receipt of nineteen coolers
it was going to be very difficult to compel
john to alter that record without giving him
an enviable opportunity to involve the
liverpool office in the rumpus-a rumpus in
which brock would be on the wrong side of
the fence because he was juggling with the
firms money while john was trying to pro-
tect its interests against the most brazen
kind of theft

  there were many things which brock did
which did not interest the liverpool office
in the least but this was not one of them

  also there was a desk between brock and
his lantern-jawed assistant just then and
as john had quite unintentionally backed
into a kernel shovel which lay upon the
floor and had casually stooped to pick it up
the situation from brocks standpoint be-
came acute-well-nigh hopeless not that
j ohn made any sort of antagonistic demon-
stration with the shovel because nothing
was farther from his mind he simply
leaned upon it and from an unbiased point
of view left the question of the disputed
cooler entirely to brock

  the agent looked at the crumpled kernel
check again then in mongrel sobo and
jakri which john did not understand he
said deprecatingly to dawanna and his
colored audience generally

  long face is empty in his head and his
book hand writes like a catfish

  he tore the check into small fragments

and threw them with a large gesture at the
woolly heads about him  make it right
for you

  he went to the desk opened the kernel
check book again and wrote rapidly when
he handed the new check to dawanna he
invited him with flattering generosity to
have another drink and left the store with-
out so much as a glance at john who still
stood leaning on the kernel shovel

  presently john investigated what brock
had done and found that the stub of the
check calling for nineteen coolers had been
canceled beneath it was another stub for
twenty coolers initialed by brock john
shrugged his shoulders closed the book and
said and thought no more about it it was
brocks responsibility if the next kernel
shipment was short at liverpool

  but the agent was not worrying about
that he knew that dawanna had deliber-
ately cheated him and simply because the
sobos trade was worth it he had flattered
him by allowing him to succeed in his thiev-
ery in the hope that he would come back
again that was just business however
doubtful its quality

  the thing that bothered brock with
daily almost hourly increasing force was
johns very apparent determination to be
right and to remain right in spite of every-
thing he brock could do to intimidate him

  brock knew he would have to put a period
upon the situation sooner or later the only
kind of period he knew or cared about and
on a certain saturday afternoon when john
asked him-which he had a perfect right
to do-for the use of the gig-boat so that he
could return a recent visit of several of the
other trading assistants up-river brock
caustically refused to let him have it hoping
that john would argue about it john did
not argue he hired a canoe and had several
of his kroo-boys do the paddling

pbj fever-laden mists were rising
bfeg from the swamps and the blazing
heat of the day was blistering the
tempers of all normal men when john de-
parted when he returned several hours
later-after having listened without com-
ment to some frankly blasphemous up-river
opinions on brock-the sun had dropped
behind the drab-green wall of the bush
leaving a heavy humid night behind it and
he found the agent on the gig-wharf flicker-
ingly outlined in the dark by the light of


adventure

a hurricane lamp in the hand of a watch-
boy

  the watch-boy was not accompanying
brock he had come down to the wharf in
answer to a lusty hail from johns kroo-
boys to lend the light of his lantern to insure
a safe landing

  whether brock was waiting for john or
not was not immediately determined be-
cause the agent ignored him when he landed
a cigaret drooped from a comer of brocks
mouth and the smoke spiraled lazily up-
ward past his unblinking eyes which had
john been able to see more clearly he would
have noted were a paler blue than usual and
seemed to have no light in them

  john ignored brock too and took his
time about the business of mopping his
forehead with a handkerchief a girl in aber-
gowrie had given him he had been doubt-
ful about accepting that handkerchief par-
ticularly since it was silk but he had finally
taken it because his mother had said-

  the lassiell be hurt awfu bad if ye
dinna aifter her makin siccan a bonny
ineetial

  john admitted the initial was bonny
small and neat like the girl herself and once
or twice he had wondered if he would be
committing himself if he were to ask her to
send him her photograph there was a
space on the wall above the table in his
room where it would just fit but he had
not done it yet

  which place canoe-man live he asked
the watch-boy referring to the canoe
owners present whereabouts

  he live foh breakwater side sah

  tell him to come get canoe two day
pass i give him book for pay

  yessah the watch-boy said obediently
and turned to trot off the wharf in the wake
of the other kroo-boys who had already
departed

  watch-boy brocks voice came to life
very suddenly even if the rest of him did
not move

  ye-yessah

  come here

  the watch-boy came shufflingly trem-
bling all over john waited then putting
the abergowrie girls handkerchief back in
the pocket of his shirt

  who told you to leave the wharf
brock asked when the watch-boy was with-
in arms length of him

  mas todd sah he say- 

  did i tell you

  no-no sah

  good tell the headman-i want him

  ye-yessah

  the watch-boy departed hurriedly and
somewhat like bellerophon proceeded to
carry the message for his own execution
john still waited he had to if the watch-
boy got into trouble it would be his respon-
sibility john was afraid it was going to
be a serious business too because there was
no doubt in his mind about the action he
would have to take if brock persisted in
being unpleasant he eyed the agent up
and down in a speculative way and the
gig-wharf being of no great size there was
less than six feet of space between them

  be it remembered that john was not
a fighter if a situation were too big for
him he left it alone or sought some means of
going around it yet thousands of miles
from anything but a trace of civilization and
on the paller beach of all places where he
was quite alone he became convinced that
the only thing to do under the circum-
stances was to turn brocks rage against
himself to exasperate him so that he would
give him john a sufficient reason for hitting
him back the mangrove swamps of the
niger delta do queer things to the most
unlikely of men

  im chargin the hire o the canoe to gen-
eral expense he said by way of a beginning
and his accent was more pronounced even
than usual ill give ye the chit to o k
on monday

  brock turned his head slowly his face
twitched as it might have done had a mos-
quito bitten him

  who gave you permission to leave the
beach he asked tonelessly

  you didnt if thats what yere in doubt
about ganson wasnt goin out so i went
which i had a right to do nobody was
using the gig so i had a right to that too
you wouldnt let me use it so i hired
a canoe

 ajjj

  that was ganson john turned his head
and saw the little cockney coming toward
them on rubber-soled shoes he had been
within hearing when brock had put his ques-
tion and johns answer flabbergasted him

  ganson

  yes sir

  take mr todd to his room and keep
him there till i have time to attend to him
john jock todd



   i think ill wait here and see whats goin
to happen to that watch-boy john said
and stayed where he was

  dont be a ruddy fool ganson advised
as gruffly as he was able but john removed
the little cockneys hand from his arm as if
it were of no account

  after the watch-boys case is settled
he insisted irritatingly then spoke directly
at brock if ye decide to flog him as i
know yeve decided already yell have to
have a wee talk wi me about it first

  you are defying my orders mr todd
brock warned in his very best manner
which as ganson well knew was always
a danger signal we call that mutiny
out here

  and im goin to prevent you from bein
a bigger brute than ye already are and we
call that charity here or anywhere if ye
have anything more to say to me about
mutiny i dont doubt but that the district
commissioner will be willin to hear it

 -you

  if ye like man if ye like but only wi
your tongue put a hand on me an itll

be the sorriest thing ye ever did

  ganson laughed but there was no joy in
it brocks eyes became flat colorless and
his heavy right hand drove for johns head
with all the precision and force of a piston
rod and john dropped as men usually did
when brock hit them and hit them right

  but that was a long way from the end of
it it was only the beginning john was
dazed and dizzy and not a little sick his
head hung over the wharfs edge and he saw
the lights on the cargo boat that lay oppo-
site marsden  cos beach go around in
circles then pop up and down then some
one was kicking him and some one else

with a cockney accent was saying -

oh my- quite often the kicks hurt

as brock intended that they should and one
of them did its best to stave in a rib

  so john slid from the wharf into the
water which was slimy and unpleasant
hut also wet and served to wake him up
he did not climb on to the wharf again
though he heard ganson nervously inquir-
ing whether he could swim he did not
stop to alleviate the sycophantic cockneys
anxiety

  under cover of the darkness he swam
quietly around to the oil wharf clambered
on to it and headed stealthily by way of the
galley stairs for home the blinking

uncertain lights of the up-river factories
were a long way off too long to be of any
use to him or the watch-boy then yet
there was a pitiless intensity of purpose in
every water-soaked step he took the little
black house-boys-or stewards-preparing
to serve dinner were busy in the saloon but
he heeded their amazed stares not at all as
he passed through it on his way to his own
room

  in a few minutes surprizingly few for
him he was dry and clothed again and on
his way down to the beach where around
one of the substantial posts that supported
the kernel store awning brock and ganson
and the headman formed a vague cluster
illuminated only by an inevitable hurricane
lamp the watch-boy was of the group too
yet not of it he was tied to the post

  john was dressed in his working-clothes
gray flannel trousers somewhat oil-smeared
and streaked with kernel dust heavy soled
shoes and the plainest kind of shirt his
jaw ached sullenly as a result of brocks
attack but the swim he had indulged in had
revived him completely

  he was not angry brock had struck him
and kicked him when he was down he was
now if he could going to strike brock
rather harder than he had been struck
which from his point of view was simple
justice and common sense combined he
had no plan of battle in fact the word
battle did not occur to him at all he was
not a fighting man

  also in championing the watch-boys
cause he was not thinking of wilberforce or
uncle tom or of any one or anything like
that had the watch-boy deserved a
thrashing as thieving careless watch-boys
sometimes do he might not have witnessed
the spectacle because he did not approve
of it but interference with the course of
justice however crude and brutalizing it
might be would never have occurred to
him in this case however 

  evidently brock and ganson had no anx-
iety about him having been drowned the
headman had seen- him slipping into the
galley and had so informed brock who
evinced no interest in the matter however
when he heard johns heavy step on the
gravel path leading from the house to the
kernel store he turned about and viewed his
approach with lowering brows

  just in time mr todd he said in a
ponderous effort to be facetious knowing at


adventure

the same time that he would have to knock
john down again we are just about to
begin

  so we are john observed dryly

kgs but he did not strike brock as
brock had struck him with the
flat of one great hand before brock
had any kind of a chance to avoid it he
cuffed the agent with all his might on
the left side of the head and while brocks
head rocked as if he had been hit with
a paddle-blade john cuffed him on the
right side of the head to preserve the bal-
ance then brocks natural instincts as
a fighter overcame his surprize and partly
to avoid more punishment but greatly to
to put an end to such tomfoolery and take
matters properly into his own hands he
closed in

  that was brocks mistake he should
have backed away but he was the bull
type of fighter and liked to move forward at
all times crushing the other man as a rule
by the pitiless ferocity of his attack and in
this case when he needed a few seconds to
clear his buzzing head he did what ring-
fighters only too frequently do he clinched

  it was then that ganson gasped aloud and
the headman jabbered something like a
ritual in kroo while the watch-boy tied to
the post did not know whether to be glad or
sorry dim shapes of canoes passing on
their way up-river seemed to hesitate to
witness the result of that conflict and a
somewhat bashful moon came out from
behind a screen of lazily moving clouds and
throwing the encircling black wall of man-
groves into high relief shed more light upon
the battle

  as brockfloundered in to wind his arms
about john and rest a little while john
very naturally tried to push him away and
brock had a momentary impression of col-
liding with the buffer of an engine just
a huge hand-johns right-flat against his
chest that was all that happened but
johns raw-boned body standing on sub-
stantial and solidly planted feet was behind
it and a second later the hand slipped up a
little bit and long hard bony fingers fast-
ened themselves about brocks bull-throat

  brock gurgled and tried at once to tear
johns hand away but john held on slowly
squeezing the breath of life out of the agents
huge body he was not doing it angrily
either just methodically brock then

tried to punch john away from him and
john retaliated instantly by rattling brocks
head with a resounding cuff that made a
noise like a pistol-shot that was johns
mistake he should have been content to
have gone on choking brock because the
slap not only helped to loosen his grip on
brocks throat but also made the agent go
quite mad

  that he was madwith fear made no dif-
ference fear is often responsible for exhi-
bitions of superhuman strength and cour-
age and when brock literally tore his throat
out of johns grip and leaped upon him and
beat him savagely to earth with several
wildly ferocious blows about the head and
face he was spending more strength than he
could afford on a night like that and was not
using his head at all

  however john was not a pugilist he
knew nothing about pugilism and could not
take advantage of brocks wildness he
tried simply to get his head clear and his
mouth empty of blood before he got up
again to stop brock flogging that watch-boy

  ganson did not help him any no one did
and he did not expect them to the head-
man and the watch-boy were muttering to
themselves and each other in kroo and
stood aghast at the spectacle of a small-boy
white man daring to fight the capn

  the veranda of the house was lined with
equally amazed house-boys called to the
scene by brocks quite audible shouts of
pain and anger and shuffling naked feet
coming from the direction of the kroo-
house indicated the presence of other
spectators peering surreptitiously around
corners the whites of their eyes flickering
in a background of black in a fair imitation
of the firefly

  then brock was kicking john again tell-
ing him with hoarsely profane insistence to
get up and the invitation concluding with a
name john did not like he did get up only to
be almost immediately knocked down again
and again brock kicked him while the
watch-boy whined and ganson excitedly

began to talk to - john spat blood

rolled away from brocks cruel feet wiped
one good eye free of sweat and tried to
scramble up once more to prevent brock
flogging the watch-boy he was not con-
scious of any great pain just a sickness in
the pit of his stomach and a dizzy uncer-
tainty as to the exact location of brocks
feet and fists
john jock todd



  half-way up again he found one of the
agents impassioned feet in his ribs and
when he had barely realized the force of
that kick before brock kicked him again
john thereupon did another very natural
thing he flung himself bodily at brocks
legs the agent was quick but he was not
quick enough john managed to get a grip
upon brocks right ankle with one hand and
the other hand coming instinctively to its
mates assistance john hung on he was
glad he had on his working clothes

  everything that happened then happened
in a very few seconds brock tried to kick
him and stamp upon him with his free foot
but john gripping the imprisoned ankle as
if his life depended upon it-which it prob-
ably did-scurried on his stomach out of
reach and made the agent squeal as his
fingers bit twistingly into his flesh

  then brock tried to drag himself free but
found that he had to drag john with him
he had no strength left for anything as
strenuous as that so he tried to stand as
firmly as possible and tug the ankle out of
johns huge-handed grip and of course had
to lift the foot off the ground to do it

   john let him lift it and slid a little nearer
but he did not let brock put the foot down
again in fact he helped brock lift it farther
than he intended and slid still nearer pull-
ing the leg up and out compelling brock to
balance himself as best he could on one leg

  a fifth of a second later brock shrieked in
very palpable agony and called upon gan-
son and the headman for help but they
did not stir at least the headman did not
and ganson not at all certain about what to
do was much too slow in acting to be of any
use to brock

  having quickly shifted his grip-one
hand at a time-from brocks ankle to his
toe and the back of his heel john had
 twisted the agents leg much as a washer-
woman wrings out a wet sheet and with
a final very determined twist and heave had
hurled brocks unbalanced hulk headlong
away from him-not unlike the manner in
which his father jock todd of abergowrie
tossed the caber

      brock came to a halt upon his
ifwb face several yards away and john
instantly getting on his feet rushed
over to him so as to get a really good grip on
the brute-mans throat one of johns
eyes was completely closed his face was

streaked with dirt and sweat and blood but
a whispering awe was all about him and it
increased when brock did not stir at least
not with any show of fight in his move-
ments the agent groaned rolled pain-
fully over on his back tried to rise then
subsided again the main difficulty being
apparently in the right leg which john had
twisted so assiduously

   ere chuck it ganson remonstrated
with john who was doing no more than
look at brock just then youll go to jug
for this

  he kicked me when i was down john
remarked breathing with some difficulty
but im hopin im not his kind then
directly to the prostrate agent who was
swearing brutally through his clenched
teeth whats the matter wi ye are
ye finished or are ye just shammin ive
a sort o notion yell take a lot o watchin
yet because yere a dog brock and its
just common justice that ye should be made
to come to heel then well see the district
commissioner about it why dont ye
get up

  brock made no answer and did not move
he knew that his right knee was dislocated
and that john todd was responsible for it
but no thoughtofthe district commissioner
had occurred to him the d c could give
him no satisfactidn only his naked hands
could do that he marked the presence of
the shadowy spectators and made a careful
mental note of the fact that the headman
and ganson had not come to his assistance
he would attend to them later too when
he had finished with john todd

   better chuck it todd im tellin yer
ganson advised again nervously this
ere aint no joke

   no yere right there little man its far
from a joke and instead o swearin the way
hes doin hed better if he hasnt forgotten
how be prayin to the lord to forgive him
for kickin me when i was down because
itll not do him a bit o good to ask me
are ye goin to get up brock or are ye
done

  since brock merely groaned and swore
still more violently john stepped away
from him and ordering the headman to
have some of his boys carry the agent up-
stairs--if he needed carrying-he released
the watch-boy who was tied to the post
told him to go about his business as usual
and then walked off betraying a slight limp


adventure

  no one interfered the headman be-
cause john was white dared not and gan-
son was utterly incapable of coping with
the situation in another few minutes the
beach was almost quiet again and john was
conscientiously washing the blood and
sweat of wrath from his body

brock did not have to be carried
to his rooms painfully and slowly
however resenting the fact that he
had to lean upon two of the most stalwart
of his kroo-boys he made his way on top
looking neither to right nor left when gan-
son following upon the heels of his master
like an obedient puppy offered to help him
he gave no heed but when the little cockney
timidly suggested sending for the district
commissioner brock paused half-way up
the stairs and looked back and down at his
senior assistant who was a step or two in
the rear

  when i want the district commissioner
mr ganson ill send for him

  and with just enough strength left to do
it he leaned all of his weight upon the sup-
porting kroo-boys swung his left leg stiff
from the hip and kicked ganson quite
neatly off the stairs then he went on
again

  ganson did not get up for quite a while in
spite of the efforts of the kroo-boy who ran
to his assistance at first he thought his
breast-bone had caved in because brocks
heavy foot had kicked him there knocking
the scanty breath out of his trifling body
but presently when the kroo-boy had
helped him to a seat on the stairs he sat
there for some time trying to realize that he
was still alive and slowly nursed a waspish
desire for revenge into a healthy state of
animation that had to have an outlet some-
where

  perhaps the spirit of john todd entered
into ganson or it may have been only the
passion that rode the humid night or just
the fact that one of brocks legs was ob-
viously not itself in any case ganson did
not decide the matter hurriedly nor did
he enter brocks room in a rampaging anger
and proceed to mop the floor with what was
left of the agent he called upon the capn
as he might have been expected to quietly
and servilely and inquired again if there
was anything he could do

  brock was in his bedroom stretched out
in a madeira chair with the leg-rest in use

there was a pint glass of brandy in the
glass-holder at his elbow his right knee
was badly swollen and was swathed in wet
cloths till the doctor came at that par-
ticular moment he was just sitting and wait-
ing till he would be able to stand again it
might be a day or a week or a month but
whenever it was he would then tie john
todd to a post instead of the watch-boy
and carve his name on johns white skin
with a hippo-hide he could almost do it
too

  no nothing he answered ganson
thickly get out

  a house-boy-brocks own-on the other
side of the bedroom door which ganson had
carefully closed heard his masters voice
and crept silently away again he felt that
intrusion at a time like that for any reason
would not be wise

  why the ard feelins capn ganson
pleaded i couldnt elp yer onest i
couldnt e grabbed old of yer leg and
ung onter it and bli me if e didnt make
yer op like you was standin on ot bricks
then when yer owled for me to come and
elp yer e tossed yer on yer ruddy ead like
you was somethin e didnt want e aint
uman e aint but that aint no reason
why we should ave a row that didnt
give you no cause for kickin me down the
ruddy stairs

  get out

  brock tried to rise but though he got his
left foot on the floor his right leg refused to
follow so useless an impulse and when gan-
son was sure of that he went a little nearer
his mean pasty little face twisting and
twitching in suddenly revealed passion

  youve booted me and given me -

for a year and a alf yer opped onter me
the first minit i landed like id eard you
ad a abit of doin when a bloke was new
and youve treated me like a ruddy bush
nigger ever since because i aint alf yer
size nor alf yer weight when i wanted ter
elp yer comin up the stairs you booted me
down em like i ad no more rights around
ere than a mongrel pup and now its my
turn blarst your eyes and im goin ter
mark yer sos itll show you-

  the rest of what ganson said is not im-
portant brocks expression was much
more interesting it was not wrathful nor
defiant nor calm it was afraid por the
first time in his life perhaps he shrank from
meeting the eye of a fellow man he knew
john jock todd



better than ganson how helpless he was
how almost impossible it was for him to
stand and how useless would be his defense
sitting in a chair against gansons speed
and knowledge

  and ganson was still fast on his feet
lightning-fast with that terrible left jab of
his which brock had feared when he had
seen it operating upon others and he was
small and hard to hit at any time brock
knew all that knew that the little man also
knew it and would not scruple to take every
advantage of his opportunity and his flesh
crawled away from the kind of punishment
ganson could inflict as it might have done
from the threat of a branding-iron like
any other brute of his type brock was
a coward before the promise of a punch on
the nose ganson hit him there many
times

  get on yer feet you blighter

  even as he spoke ganson darted in
struck and darted out again and the snake-
like speed and suddenness of the blow was
more responsible for the whine that escaped
brock than the force of it and when
a second later with an effort born wholly of
fear he tried to struggle to his feet ganson
feinted and slipped in-and out again-
and a red trickle drooled out of a corner of
brocks mouth as he flopped whimperingly
back into his chair

  it was not a fight simply a new form of
inquisition a deliberate malicious torturing
of brocks huge pain-racked body by the
only method ganson knew anything about
he gave to the left jab of the squared circle
a new significance placing it alongside the
thumb-screw and the boot

  the world beyond brocks bedroom door
and windows was ominously silent dank
and heavy and unresponsive to brocks
whining calls for help as the shifty little
cockney saw to it that the nasty work went
on jab-a pause-jab-a pause-jab-
a pause-jab-jab-jab-jab----

  brocks boy in answer to his masters
cries came as far as the bedroom door but
did not open it he knew ganson was in
there and gansons hands were like a ju-ju
they struck one on the nose and the eye and
the belly and the jaw all at once and
brocks boy had no desire to be hit in or on
any of those places either at once or separ-
ately the chief steward to whom he told
his troubles felt the same way about it so
finally and quite naturally they went to

john todd who was eating his dinner in his
own room and enjoying the change they
told him that ganson was killing the capn
and john who had heard brocks yells but
had paid no attention to them because he
did not imagine that brock could possibly
be yelling for him went to inquire into the
matter

  by that time brocks face-but johns
one good eye did not see it brock had
buried it in the pillow behind him and
shielding his head with his arms as best he
could only an ear was left exposed when
ganson began to punch that too brock
began to cry he was still crying and gan-
son was still punching when john went in

  what are ye doin ye little rat here
stop it youll knock that ear away from

his head if ye-

  dont let him hit me dont let him hit
me again came the mumbling wail from
the pillow and john knew then that there
was no fight left in brocks body or his soul

  ganson stopped he could not help him-
self johns great right hand was about his
thin neck and as if he were of no more con-
sequence than a dirty towel john flung him
against the opposite wall with a force that
knocked most of the venom out of his sys-
tem ere he could recover from the shock
john gripped him by the neck again and
compelling him to stand upright shook him
till his teeth rattled

  what do ye mean by it hittin a help-
less man like that are ye daft

  dont let him hit me brock whimpered

again into the pillow dont let him-

  oh you hold your tongue you big
blubberin bairn

  brock obeyed instantly gansons arms
hung limply at his sides his legs were
weaving under him his face was like chalk
and perspiration streamed from him like
rain

  i marked im i marked the blighter
es a mess thats what-just a ruddy

mess

  john took gansons word for it he
tightened his hold upon the little cockneys
neck and said dryly

  come wi me little man and ill put
ye to your bed thatll be the safest place
for you im thinkin because im afraid
yeve got a vicious disposeetion

  and much as if he were trailing a sack
behind him he dragged ganson from the
room


adventure

john went up-river again that
nightthis time in the gig only to
find that the story of the manner
in which he had brought about brocks
downfall had preceded him half-way to
the district commissioners whither he was
bound he was met by a gigful of traders
assistants who were going down to the
paller beach to find out if there was any
truth in the later story that ganson had
killed the agent

  john told them solemnly that there was
not and though they seemed disappointed
about it they turned and went back with
him to hear him tell daniel dane parker
the d c his version of the whole business
which he did and later proved every word
of it to the d cs complete satisfaction
so that brock was quietly but officially re-
moved from the country and john for a

time ran the paller factory alone until the
liverpool office sent him an assistant or
two it was thought best to invalid
ganson home because his heart was
bad

  but the thing that sticks in johns crop
is the fact that when he had finished telling
his story to the d c a compatriot of his
meeting him on the way to the consulate
gig-wharf greeted him most familiarly with
hullo jock whats this ive been
hearin about ye

  because as john was careful to explain to
the girl in abergowrie when nearly two
years later he asked her by word of mouth
to let him take her photograph back to the
coast with him

  that name may fit my faither but it
doesnt fit me you know fine bella that
im not a fightin man

the two men broke into a shambling
run one of them unhooked the
canteen from his belt and forged a
bit ahead of the other at the
brink of the small declivity he stopped an
agonized cry came through his parched lips
o god he groaned jim its dry
jim came up beside him he looked
down at the waterless water-hole the
other man was exhibiting signs of panic
with a sidelong glance at him jim re-
marked-

  kinda looks that way dont it

  the other hurled the now useless canteen
to the ground and began to curse the deity
he had a moment before invoked his

action suggested the blind frenzy of despair
jim looked at his partner steadily

  save yer breath bob he spoke in a
low even tone that checked the others mad
outburst better drop yer gun too extra
weight

  he let his own cartridge belt and holster
drop by way of example but bob did not
follow suit instead at the mention of the
word gun a wild look crept into his eyes
jim saw and acted quickly

  no you dont he said yanking bobs
weapon from its sheath and flinging it as far
as he was able bob old man ketch hold
on yerself were livin yet aint we we
still got some chance o gettin through
desert men



its a cinch we aint the only rats outn this
here desert were liable to pick up with
somebody whos got water to spare n-

  no chance muttered bob were as
good as dead already

  aw cut it then we gotta make bed-
rock we cn do it by goin steady cmon
git goin we wasted too much time now
jim started off in the direction of the small
town of bedrock their only hope bob
shuffled after him

  with hat brims pulled down to shade
their eyes and heads bent forward the two
men walked in an inferno not a vestige
of shade anywhere the trackless waste
afforded not an inch of shelter from the
merciless sun that beat down upon them
from a coppery sky the heat devils danced
and whirled around them yet they went
on because one was fired by the desire to
live and possessed the strength of will to
drive the other

  it was hell step step step until walk-
ing became automatic a burning thirst
precluded other suffering their parched
throats and caked lips cried insistently for
water as if in punishment for bobs
blasphemy the sun shone with a terrible
brilliance and by an irony of fate jims
canteen hung unnoticed at his side
neither spoke there was no need for con-
versation when bob faltered in his stride
jim grasped him by the arm and urged him
on and still they went plodding on how
long jim asked himself would the fight
continue

  all the rest of that day they fought their
way step by tortuous step across the blaz-
ing sand to jim the struggle for life be-
came an obsession in his semi-delirium he
fancied the sun a living enemy he shook
his fist at it tried to swear at it and drag-
ged bob with him to defeat its efforts to
kill them

iff with evening came a slight mea-
gjjs sure of relief they flung their
  aching bodies to the cooling sand to
rest when they had lain there for some
time jim turned to rise in the movement
he felt the canteen at his side snatched it
eagerly and shook it the hope that had
started in his breast died when no gurgle
came to his ear in his feverish state hed
forgotten that the thing had been emptied
he dropped it beside his partner who lay
outstretched with his eyes closed then

the nucleus of a wild idea germinating in
his brain he snatched it up again and re-
turned it to the hook on his belt it took
a good deal of effort to kick bob to his feet
but jim succeeded after renewed attempts
and off they started again on their weary
march

  had any one ever accused jim coulter of
being a psychologist he would have an-
swered i dont sabe greek whats it
in ordnary lingo yet the crazy scheme
he turned over in his mind would have been
worthy of a scientist no student of mind
over matter was jim however so well
say that providence suggested the plan to
him and let it go at that

  with the dawn of the next day bob sank
down without a word and stubbornly
refused to move and jim dropped to the
sand beside him to gather what little
strength he had in reserve after a short
time he crawled to his feet and unhooked
the canteen from his belt then he bent
over the prostrate form of his partner and
shook him when bob looked up at him he
held the canteen up to his lips and pretended
to drink from it at this bobs eyes grew
wide

  he raised himself on one hand and held
out the other his jaw dropped in amaze-
ment when jim forcing a grin through the
alkali dust on his face shook his head and
turned away bob tried to speak but no
sound issued from his throat the word
water formed on his lips jim had water
jim had water jim had water

  the thought burned into his brain with
insistence he got drunkenly to his feet and
staggered after him the mad race had
begun

  jim turned and held the canteen to bis
lips again tauntingly a horrible scream
forced its rasping way up from bobs
throat he tried to run forward and fell
he got up again and lurched after jim who
had water water jim had water and
wouldnt give him any jim realized now
that he had created a raving frankenstein
monster that threatened to destroy him
he hooked the canteen to his belt and did
not turn again

over the hill that hides the town
of bedrock from the expanse of the
great desert two grizzled old pros-
pectors urged their flea-bitten burros as
they stopped at the brow of the ascent to
 

adventure

wipe their perspiring faces one of them
dropped his bandanna

  jumpin horse-flies he yelled look
dusty

  dusty following with his eyes the direc-
tion indicated by the others outstretched
arm beheld the figure of a man crawling
followed at a distance of about twenty feet
by another who staggered drunkenly both
old men started down the other side of the
hill at a dead run they reached the pair
just in time to prevent the second fellow
who had caught up with the other from
falling upon him

  despite his apparent weakened condi-
tion the man seemed endowed with the
strength of a maniac and presented a tough
problem which dusty solved by tapping him
on the head with the butt of his colt
they then turned their attentions to the
other who still showed signs of life on his
belt was a canteen which they found to be
empty

  here samuel said dusty to the other
you take the water bag an tend to em
while i beat it back to town fer help

  it took some time and careful nursing to
bring bob back to his health and normal
mentality but a doctor who had been im-
ported from a more modern town than bed-
rock accomplished this successfully once
he had regained control of his reasoning
bob was not long in coming to the realiza-
tion of what his partner had done for him
after their burros had strayed away from
them during the sand-storm that had buried
their water-bags jims canteen had been
emptied first and there remained only the
obvious conclusion that jim had literally
taunted him into saving himself when jim
hearing that his friend was convalescent
came to see him bob had tears in his
eyes

  jim old-timer he said after they shook
hands im gonna give you my share in the
mine you saved my worthless carcass an
thats the least i can do

  like-you are listen bob jim

added when he saw the protest forming on
his lips how in blazes do you think i could
a got through if i didnt have you a-tearin
after me redy to chaw me up

lord theyre at it again
a deep chorus of groans went
up from the group of ameri-
cans and englishmen on the
galley of the confederate consulate at
puerto velasco that frowzy little seaport of
the frowzy little republic of equatan

  come on you chaps lets go over to the
central said murray the british consul
no use staying here

  i should say not indorsed bogardus of

the ferrocarril nacional with a disgusted
oath and the drinks are on you grim-
shaw what in tropical tophet did you
do it for

  do what asked the bewildered young
mining engineer who was new to the coun-
try what on earth do you mean
american civil war has started again
thats all drawled murray cant you
hear it raging

  he jerked his head toward the far end of
old smooth bores



the long veranda where the only two men
had not risen with the rest were sitting bolt-
upright on the edges of their chairs and
glaring into each others faces while they
argued furiously as both were talking at
the same time and at the top of their
voices grimshaw could only catch disjointed
fragments

the opening chorus said the railroad

sponses back and forth all night come on
grimshaw what are you waiting for

  to say good night to our host an-
swered the young man stiffly

  quite right approved the english-
man but really youre not offending
him by going away like this in fact hell
hunt you up tomorrow and apologize
profusely for forgetting himself-and next
time it will be the same thing over again
were used to it here in puerto velasco

  captain tyler and captain holcomb
are two of the sanest and most courteous
gentlemen alive until some one makes the
error of referring to the naval operations
of your late civil war then they go
quite mad just like that

  and the man who is guilty of starting
them off is fined a round of drinks for the
crowd explained bogardus for this is
the best loafing-place in town but nobody
wants to stay here after the old smooth
bores start firing come on over to the
central grimshaw and set em up

  grimshaw followed obediently but
turned as they reached the steps for a part-
ing look at the two old sea captains deep
in argument and entirely unaware of his
going they made a picturesque pair as they
sat there in the bright tropic moonlight
both were middle-sized middle-aged men
in clean white duck but otherwise different
in every detail

  captain ezra holcomb skipper and
owner of the hattie holcomb was a short
thick man with a short thick beard and a
clean-shaven upper lip the squareness of
his lines was emphasized by his rigidly
starched and ironed duck trousers and
double-breasted coat as spotless as the
hattie holcombs deck and with every brass
button shining as bright work should he

came of a long line of new england seamen
and had held a temporary commission as
lieutenant-commander under farragut in
the civil war

  captain zeb tyler c s n had appar-
ently served as everything from gunners
mate on the merrimac to handy man for
the confederate torpedo service he
hated uniforms and detested starch his
shirts and white suits were soft and shape-
less and he wore an old-time planters palm-
leaf hat with a wide brim and low round
crown he was long and lean and seemed
much older than ezra holcomb for while
the latters beard was a grizzled brown zeb
tylers long mustache and goatee were
snowy white

  why do they call him the confederate
consul asked grimshaw as he and the
other two walked toward the hotel central

  because he keeps the stars and bars
flying from that staff in front of his house
like the flag on a regular consulate most
of the natives think he is a real consul and
respect him accordingly he came down
here in sixty-six because he wouldnt take
the oath of allegiance to the united states
and hes lived here ever since explained
bogardus

   fancy living fifteen years in this filthy
fever-hole said the englishman with a
shudder dont you think hell chuck it
and go back to the states some day

  not unless they turn the clock back to
 declared bogardus he doesnt
even know that its  now

  they entered the crowded central bar
where grimshaw did his duty

  and now he demanded will some
gentleman kindly tell me what it was i
said that broke up the party

  you asked what sort of a warship the
patria was answered murray fatal
question that captain holcomb promptly
replied a civil war monitor and that
last word was a red rag to captain tyler
our friend the confederate consul firmly
believes that the merrimac whipped the
monitor and that the southern navy was
on the point of winning the war when lees
army unaccountably surrendered

  i remember now said grimshaw
i asked because i was wondering whether
the patria would be able to run past the
forts and into the harbor in case admiral
flores is really sending her up the coast
to squeeze money and supplies out of


adventure

velasco do you think that gold-laced
pirate will do anything of the kind

   i rather fear so said the british consul
you see i was down on the west coast
in seventy-seven when the peruvian iron-
clad huascar went on the loose and buc-
caneered all over the shop her crew of
merry mutineers bagged no end of plunder
out of some of the coast towns and bom-
barded those that wouldnt pay they
finally had the impudence to stop and rob
english steamers on the high seas

  when our minister protested the peru-
vian government disclaimed all responsi-
bility just as equatan has done since its
own navy has started another one of these
floating revolutions two of our cruisers
put out after the huascar and ran her down
in ylo bay

  she showed fight and they found her
rather an awkward customer for she was
an armored ship and they were not but
they gave her such a dusting that her crew
were glad to surrender to their own people
next day and instead of thanking us for
putting a stop to the piracy the peruvians
were loudly indignant because we had fired
on her rather quaint what

  all of that agreed grimshaw but
whos to put a stop to admiral flores if he
starts playing that game around here he
has the whole equatan navy with him and
the forts are as old as the fleet is modern
and theres no cable nor any american or
english warships anywhere within reach

  suppose the patria or the big conquis-
tador started to shoot up puerto velasco
im interested because ive got about twenty
tons of dynamite and rackarock piled up on
the railroad pier where it was lightered
ashore from the hattie holcomb yesterday
one shell in the middle of that consignment
wouldnt leave much of the waterfront

  as soon as i heard the rumor that a
florista ironclad was coming i went to our
consulate to see if i couldnt get a gunboat
or an injunction against bombardments or
something but i found the american
consul flat on his back with fever and his
native clerks only know one word of their
own language and thats manana so i just
thought id mention the matter to you
mr murray

  i shant forget it thank you but
lets hope there wont be any bombard-
ment

  i dont much care if there is growled

bogardus itd make the company build
me a decent pier and give the old smooth-
bores something new to talk about

ffina don zebulon don zebu-

iffil lon

        zeb tyler found it hard work to
open his eyes that morning for he had gone
to bed only two hours before after fighting
the civil war all over again with ezra
holcomb and a demijohn of prime old
bourbon rubbing his lids apart he
found standing beside his bed and shaking
him by the shoulder a plump little latin-
american in a parrot-green uniform that
was two-thirds tarnished gold lace

  good mohnin colonel said captain
tyler with an accustomed courtesy that
took no notice of such trifles as an aching
head and parching throat am i to have
the honuh of yo company at breakfast
suh

  but colonel pablo paredes the coman-
dante of puerto velasco was for once too
deeply agitated to think of eating

  don zebulon i have come to crave your
assistance as a torpedero of so great skill and
fame our beautiful city is menaced with
destruction by those vile pirates of floris-
tas a monitor is approaching-

  zeb tyler waited to hear no more
tearing away the mosquito-bar he leaped
out of bed and ran out on the veranda-or
as he insisted on calling it the gallery-for
a look to seaward his keen gray eyes
undimmed by age picked out a tiny
familiar-looking craft slowly creeping across
the sunlit blue water outside toward the
two crumbling fortresses that a long-dead
spanish viceroy had built to defend the
narrow entrance to velasco harbor

  the sight of her raft-like hull and single
turret was more than enough for the old
confederate

  by gad suh he growled its that
blank yank monitor the oswego-the
patria as they call her nowadays shes
headin fo the pot suah enough and shell
be within range of yo fots inside of an
houah suh

  within range of her guns but not of ours
don zebulon replied paredes sadly
she could batter down our walls from
afar or steam past us into the harbor with
the balls from our ancient ordnance re-
bounding from her armor therefore i
have galloped here as soon as the pirate
old smooth bores



was sighted from the ramparts to ask your
assistance and advice

  and i shall be most happy to suhve
you suh declared tyler he had a genu-
ine liking for the chubby little comandante
who was a stout soldier in every sense of
the word my advice colonel is to ask
mistuh murray and the othuh consuls to
go out in a launch and warn those scalawags
against bringing down fo or five navies on
their heads by shootin up foeign propuhty
suh

  the consuls are about to do that very
thing don zebulon but in the absence of
all foreign warships i fear that the floristas

urn grimshaw patrolling the other-
wise deserted railroad wharf with a
 pick-handle in his fist and a small
mountain of high explosives and othei
tempting loot piled up all around him
humorously compared himself to the boy
who stood on the burning deck whence ail
but him had fled the native stevedores
had struck and departed inland at top
speed on the first report of the sighting
of the florista ironclad the freight train
that was to have carried this shipment up
to the mines was just now passing the city
limits with refugees clinging to it like
swarming bees

will take no heed we have neither money
to pay a ranson nor force to keep them out
what then can save our city

  this suh cried zeb tyler in ringing
tones as stepping back into his bedroom he
picked up and brandished the almost empty
demijohn

 that don zebulon gasped the
astounded paredes

  draining the last of the bourbon into
two tall glasses zeb tyler courteously
offered one to his guest and poured the
neat contents of the other down his own
throat like so much spring-water before
the comandante could swallow his own por-
tion tyler had tucked the tails of his
nightgown into a pair of duck trousers
thrust his feet into elastic-sided boots
clapped on his palm-leaf hat and was loping
along the water-front shaking one bony fist
at the approaching monitor and with the
other clutching the now empty demijohn

  thousands of other refugees were throng-
ing and clamoring about the stations and
yards where bogardus was profanely
making up and dispatching trains as fast as
he could drive his fever- and panic-stricken
staff out of the frightened crowd and
down to the wharf came striding the tall
self-possessed figure of captain zeb tyler

  mistuh grimshaw he said lifting his
hat with a stately old-time flourish i
wish to apologize fo my fogetfulness of my
duties as a host last night when i foced
you and the othuh young men to run fo yo
lives to escape being boed to death suh
not at all captain tyler protested
the embarrassed grimshaw who was trying
to keep his eyes off the demijohn and won-
dering whether the confederate consul was
about to produce two tumblers and pour out
a peace offering

  the trouble with us of the olduh genuh-
ration suh is that we live too much in the
o

adventure

past continued the veteran smoothly
we sometimes fail to appreciate the won-
duhs of the present such as this suh

  from a shattered box which the steve-
dores had light-heartedly smashed in throw-
ing it up from the lighter to the pier zeb
tyler picked up a long yellow stick of
dynamite

  would yo company be willing to sell me
a few quats of this most efficacious explo-
sive mistuh grimshaw

  quarts

  or howevuh you measure it suh
said tyler thrusting the stick of sixty per
cent into the mouth of the demijohn and
half a dozen more after it as tranquilly
as a shopkeeper filling a jar with pepper-
mint candy he took out his jack-knife
split the end of the last stick and inserted a
detonator wired it dropped it in on top
of the rest cut a groove for the wires in the
side of the cork and hammered it in tight

  hold on there remonstrated grim-
shaw

  calm yoself mistuh grimshaw calm
yoself purred-tyler

  he closed the jack-knife put it back in his
pocket and produced a large red stick of
sealing-wax and a three-inch square of thin
pine whose serrated and pink-tipped edge
he rubbed sharply across the nearest dyna-
mite box there was a fizz a splutter and
the peculiar sulfurous stench of old-fash-
ioned new england card-matches

  don agitate yoself suh don agitate
yoself he continued as he held the seal-
ing-wax against the reeking blue flame

  already softened by the tropic heat it
readily melted and was deftly smeared over
the cork and neck of the demijohn

  i found this on mistuh bogadus desk
in the station explained the garrulous old-
timer bending over his work i took the
libuhty of borrowing it without distubing
his exhotations to the multitude mistuh
bogadus has a magnificent flow of lan-
guage suh i have nevuh heard nobluh
rhetoric since the day i met the yankee
captain of that blink-blanked monitor the
oswego did i evuh tell you about that
mistuh grimshaw

  there was no reply because grimshaw
was no longer on the wharf the match-
striking had been too much for him from
a discreet distance he watched old zeb
tyler ignite -and burn up card after card
of matches-also taken from mistuh

bogadus desk-while the confederate
consul waxed and talked contentedly on

  it was in the late spring of  that i
was squattin like this in an obsohvation-
pit on the noth bank of the jeems rivuh
with my weathuh eye on the spot befoh
me where i had anchored a jimmyjohn the
vey spit and image of this one suh and
chaged with as much black powduh as it
could hold and still float in my hands i
held the ends of the wiahs i had com-
mandeered from the nearest railroad sta-
tion togethuh with the necessary electric
batteries such as i but now intended to
obtain from mistuh bogadus till i thought
of a bettuh way suh

  aftuh a while suh i brought the two
wiahs togethuh and a yankee double-
enduh gunboat went fohty or fifty feet
straight up into the air settin on top of an
imposin column of watuh i was so much
engrossed in this gratifyin spectacle that i
failed to obsuhve a landin-party from the
next yankee vessel around the bend down-
stream until they began jumpin down into
the pit on top of me mistuh grimshaw

  they prodded me back ahead of em
with the points of their cutlasses to their
ship the oswego their captain was a
naval officuh of the old school suh and
powerful prejudiced against topedoes he
declared his intentions mistuh grimshaw
of hanging me at his yard-arm and was only
dissuaded by the scacity of such-like con-
trivances on a monitor next he meditated
rammin me into one of his fifteen-inch
rodman smooth-boes and seein how fah
id travel when he shot it off suh

  then he thought of a still mo dastahdly
scheme

   take this ding-donged bing-banged
reb into the bows he commanded with
horrible ferocity suh lash him ovah
the stem-make a cut-watah out of him
let him smell out his own dash-dotted
topedoes

  and lo the rest of that day suh i
acted as the oswegos cut-watah while she
was a-steamin right amongst ouah anchoed
topedoes or mines as you call them nowa-
days mistuh grimshaw i reckon ill
paddle out and anchor one of them right
now where it will do the most good suh

  with a miners pick from another burst
packing-case zeb tvler swiftly burglarized
a couple of hitherto intact boxes and looted
them of much insulated wire and an electric
old smooth bores



battery and firing-device these things
and the loaded demijohn he stowed in one
of the cayucas or native dugouts moored to
the wharf and lashed the cable of the heavy
anchor-stone to the demijohns handle

  just as he had completed this job to his
satisfaction the boom of a heavy gun drew
his attention to seaward he saw the
consular launch coming back into the harbor
and the monitor following menacingly
astern diplomacy had failed the bom-
bardment was about to begin

  zeb tyler dropped into t he caynca cast
off the painter and paddled out into the
harbor toward la angostura-the narrow-
est and crookedest part of the ship-channel
that zigzagged in and out through the
shoals and reefs of puerto velasco

pw captain ezra holcomb
p  stumping restlessly from side to side
of the ilattie holcombs bridge saw
zeb put off in the dugout and remarked-
what in sam hill do you spose that
durned old secesh is doing out there at this
time of day mr jewell

  guess hes going fishing hazarded the
first officer leastways hes got a jug
with him

  crazy old coot growled the yankee
skipper first thing he knows hell find
himself right in the line of fire

  mebbe he aint so crazy as he looks
drawled the mate guess hes figured out
that thats the safest place to be from the
way both sides are shootin just now

  the battle between the monitor and the
forts was raging with great sound and fury
each of the eastles and its numerous re-
doubts and water-batteries had a splendid
collection of rare old bronze and iron
culverins demi-cannon cannon-royal coe-
hoorns carronades and other relics of the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and
all of them were blazing away together
steadily through the din rolled the deep
thunder of the patrias fifteen-inch muzzle-
loading smooth bores

  they kept it up for thirty minutes
filling the air with smoke and cannon-balls
and keeping the echoes busy but doing
remarkably little damage to either the ship
or the forts then the monitor simply
steamed straight in through tle narrow
entrance-channel between the two highly
indignant fortresses with occasional solid

shot bouncing off her ten-inch laminated
  c

armor up the long bay she angled from
the buoy till her captain judged that the
time had come to give puerto velasco a
strong hint to pay up or take the conse-
quences

  so he ordered a sell to fibehred into the
heart of the city now within easy range
round spun the turret but the spindle was
worn and faulty and it turned too far
the gunners inside shut up in a perfectly
circular box had long since lost all sense of
direction therefore the shell missed the
city by about three-quarters of a mile and
flew straight across to the secluded corner
of the harbor where the hattie holcomb
lay at anchor bows on and with five large
american flags prominently displayed

  gol durn it you were right abner
shouted captain holcomb as his war-
trained eye observed the big black sphere
with a trail of smoke from its sputtering
fuse curving down on them like a comet

  jump for your life shes heading
straight for the bridge

  skipper and mate hit the deck together
just as the shell smashed its way below and
aft through the chart-room fidley and
engine-room into the after-hold where it
exploded luckily all hands who were not
ashore were forward watching the bom-
bardment and no one was killed or even
injured by the flying fragments of planking
and deck-fittings that were blown up aft
when the smoke cleared they saw that the
hattie holcomb was minus most of her
stern and sinking rapidly

  they had just time to get the boats
overside and pull clear before she went
down

  that wipes me out said ezra hol-
comb late skipper and owner ruefully
total loss and no insurance

  no insurance echoed the sympathetic
but puzzled mr jewell from the stern-
sheets of his boat which he had brought
alongside the captains while they checked
up the count of heads thought you had
her well covered sir

   except by act of war or piracy 
quoted captain holcomb from the well-
remembered text of the policy its either
one or the other mr jewel and clear sailing
for the marine insurance people theyll
never pay up in a thousand years

  its war by thunder declared the
mate with approving growls from the
crew which contained an unusually high


adventure

percentage of americans theyve fired on
our flag and washington ought to send a
warship down here to make em pay
damages

  and what goodd that do cept to kill
a lot of good boys with yellow fever like
when they sent the portsmouth to panama
demanded the captain scornfully no-
bodys ever squeezed a cent of damages out
of these slippery yellow-bellies the equa-
tan government will just blame it on the
floristas same as peru did on the huascars
crew

  then its piracy and whats a navy
for-

  mr jewells question broke off short and
remained unanswered as he and the others
saw the monitor suddenly heel far over to
port right herself push blindly past the
buoy that marked the next turn of the
channel and go down in a cloud of steam
and a shower of spray

  give way cried captain holcomb
lay em aboard

  the patria had sunk in shoal water
most of her funnel and the railed top of her
turret were still above the surface many
of her crew had time to scramble out
through hatches and gun-ports wading
breast-deep along the deck they assembled
on the turret roof around the little conning-
tower that surmounted it

  sheer off shrieked the patrias cap-
tain shaking his sword menacingly at the
 narmed boats bearing down upon him
sheer off or we fire i will only surrender
to proper authority

  ill render you proper you black-and-
tan pirate answered ezra holcomb
board board

  unchecked by a rattling fire of ill-aimed
pistol-shots the hattie holcombs men
pulled right across the monitors sunken
deck and drew up alongside the island-like
turret-top over and under the rail they
scrambled using boat-stretchers and knives
holcomb and his bucko mates leading and
clearing the way with smashing blows of
their iron fists

  peeping over the curved rim of the un-
roofed conning-tower which was shaped
rather like an oversized loving-cup without
any handles the patrias captain shrilly
exhorted his brave bluejackets to stand
fast and repulse the foe unfortunately
for himself he was unable to look in all
directions at once though the fight seemed

to be going equally badly in every quarter
leaning over to starboard in a well-meant
effort to reach the back of mr jewells
neck with the point of his sword the
florista officer failed to notice captain
holcomb scaling the port side of the loving-
cup until he heard some one drop heavily
down behind him

  two mighty hands picked him up like a
toy lifted him high in the air turned him
about and shifted their grip till they held
him dangling head-downward by the ankles
around and around they swung him as a
hammer-thrower swings his hammer and
then let go

  that panted ezra holcomb thatll
teach him to play pirate

   terrified by their captains fate the bat-
tered survivors of the patrias crew threw
down their weapons and surrendered

  leave em be ordered holcomb
reckon i can find use for em this
jobs done but weve got another one to do
right now

   a piercing rebel yell drew his attention
to an approaching dugout the first of
many craft now putting out from shore

   whats yo poo old no-account monitor
good fo now capn holcomb asked the
exultant zeb tyler all i had to do was
to set in a splint-bottomed rocking-chair
on my gallery and twiddle my fingers to
bust her wide open with a jimmyjohn
topedo suh

   you did heh said the new englander
whose feelings toward the patria had under-
gone a swift and complete revulsion

   his wrath was still hot against the flor-
ista fleet but for the captured monitor her-
self he felt only the sympathy due an old
comrade who had fallen on evil days

   ill raise her he added and show you
what shes good for by thunder

   zeb tyler gave a derisive snort

   you couldnt histe her up nohow suh
shell stay thar and rust till jedgment day
shell be afloat again and fitten to fight
in lessn a week proclaimed ezra hol-
comb its the simplest kind of a job as
anybody cept a shiftless johnny reb
could see in a minute

   the patrias lying here on hard clean
sand in shoal water with six inches of her
turret sticking out now at high flood at
low ebb shell be pretty near high and dry
most of the water inside her will run out
through the hole you knocked in her bottom
old smooth bores



and the rest can be siphoned out then
well bolt a timber patch over the hole

  mr jewell youd better go ashore and
dicker with jim bogardus for one of the
railroad tugs and six of those big flat-
bottomed lighters pick up a couple of
hundred fathom of wire cable well try
and sweep lines under the monitors keel
and lash the lighters alongside three to
port and three to starboard like pontoons
to help keep her afloat

  mebbe we can get her own pumps to
working by the way the steam went up
when she sank i calculate somebody must
have opened her valves in time to save her
bilers from busting magazines flooded
of course but this class carry their powder
in water-tight copper tanks a hundred-
pound charge to a tank so thatll be all
right anyhow we can use the tugs pumps
to take care of what leaks in around the
patch after tonights tide lifts her up and
were towing her over to the gridiron

  the gridiron was a famous feature of
puerto velasco it was built between two
of the islands in the harbor and was big
enough to boil a sperm whale on as most
of the water ran out of the port at low tide
a vessel could be stranded on the gridiron
and have her barnacled and weed-furred
plates scraped and painted as handily as
in any dry-dock

  why dont you float and fix up yo own
ship thataway capn holcomb asked
zeb tyler never thought id be so sor-
rowful to see any yankee craft go down as
i was when those scalawags sank her suh
the hattie holcomb  never float
again said her skipper sadly that
shell just blew her stern off and shes lying
in deep water and on soft mud thatll swal-
low her up fast bout all we can do is to
salvage her deck-fittings and junk her top-
sides at low tide i calculate to get my
money back out of salvaging the patria
what do you aim to do with her once
you get her fixed

  ill offer to take command of her and
teach these florista rebs a lesson or two in
naval gunnery guess the government
crowd will be willing to give me a com-
mission and hire me on most any terms
and in the meanwhile capn tyler youd
better make medicine with colonel paredes
and start fixing up some more of your im-
moral whisky-jug and beer-keg torpedoes
and plant em out there in the offing where

theyll sort of discourage the rest of the
florista navy from coming in here before
were ready for em

  when admiral don pasquale juan ba-
tista flores hears about todays doings i
guess hell be the maddest little man afloat

terrible indeed was the wrath
of admiral flores when the news of
the torpedoing of the patria reached
him at rio verde vowing a fearful ven-
geance he worked for a week to put his
ships into something like sea-going shape
and to commandeer enough coal to take
them up the coast to puerto velasco

  the first sight of the approaching armada
was the signal for every foreign vessel in
port to make sail or raise steam and scurry
out to sea neutrals were taking no more
chances with the florista brand of marks-
manship

  piloted through the new-laid mine-fields
filed the procession-a stately royal mail
packet a dingy spanish liner two british
tramps and a swedish bark then came a
miracle puffing placidly along at her
usual seven knots newly painted and ap-
parently well laden steamed the good ship
hattie holcomb

  her appearance caused great astonish-
ment but even greater relief to the insur-
gent admiral and his staff on the bridge of
the flag-ship-the great german-built iron-
clad conquistador

  obviously she was not sunk at all
declared flores doubtless she was not
even fired on it was all a lie-a vile trick
of our enemies to discredit us with the
americans of the north

  his staff nodded in entire agreement
it was exactly the sort of story to expect
in the atmosphere of wild rumors and reck-
less propaganda that many latin americans
breathe from birth

  nevertheless we must not take too
much for granted continued the admiral
signal the vaquero tooverhaul that steamer
and make sure that she is indeed the hattie
holcomb but let it be done with all cour-
tesy and with no display of force

  away sped the vaquero a neat little
specimen of the new class of torpedo-gun-
boats at a seventeen-knot clip in the wake
of the neutral shipping which was unani-
mously heading up the coast to get out of
range first and set a course afterward as
the diminutive warship came foaming up


adventure

astern she was greeted by a tremendously
loud hail-

  sheer off there-dont you come a-
scratchin of any of my new paint with that
clockwork toy

  there was no mistaking the voice and
figure of ezra holcomb known to every
child up and down the equatan coast or
the tall thin blue funnel the ornate and
much admired gingerbread-work on her
wheel-house and the other familiar features
of the hattie holcomb

  we were informed that you had been
sunk-we rejoice that it is not so replied
the vaqueros best linguist as the gunboat
drew up abeam

  there was almost no wind and less sea
so conversation was safe and easy

  rejoicings are mutual answered hol-
comb affably it wasnt this ship that
was sunk it was the other one and shes
there yet at the bottom of puerto velasco
harbor

  then she has not been raised and re-
paired as we were told asked the florista
thinking of the patria and delighted to
hear such important and welcome news

  take a look from your masthead and
see for yourself

  have any more mines been planted in
the channels

  thick as currants in aunt janes fruit-
cake warned holcomb you can see
em setting out more right now in the fair-
way where we came out

  many thanks senor capitdn and good-
by

  hasta la vista bellowed holcomb as
the vaquero swung round and departed to
make her report to the admiral

  the florista fleet steamed impressively
in toward the harbor mouth where zeb
tylers mine-planting flotilla of dug-outs
and launches were busily blocking the last
open strip of channel they scattered like
water-bugs when a stone is dropped into a
pond as a twelve-inch gun spoke from the
conquistadors forward barbette

  but their work was done and until it was
undone and the channel cleared again it
would be suicide for any ship to try to force
her way into the harbor bringing the
conquistador in as closely as he deemed
safe admiral flores squeezed his bulk up
the steep spiral stairs inside the towering
military mast and studied the situation
from the forward fighting-top

  he could see the unmistakable funnel and
conning-tower of the sunken patria still
sticking out of the water on angostura
shoal beyond lay the city at the head of
its long harbor but already within reach of
the conquistadors twelve-inch krupps
however there was neither plunder nor
prestige to be won by bombarding puerto
velasco at long range instead flores de-
cided to batter down the two old fortresses
and then send in his mine-sweepers to clear
the channel

  accordingly his four ironclads-the
conquistador robusto esperama and pri-
mer o de abril-steamed in and opened fire
on the forts at four thousand yards-far
outside the range of the ancient ordnance
ashore the gunners afloat had a glorious
time smashing up the two most picturesque
and imposing ruins in their native land

slipping into a convenient little
lagoon just around the curve of
the coast-line from puerto velasco
and very popular with the smugglers and
gun-runners the ghost of the hattie hol-
comb let go her anchor and lay there at
peace with the world while her skipper and
crew listened to the rumbling of the distant
bombardment if any one had asked what
they were doing there he would have
learned there was a breakdown ii the
engine-room

  but no one appeared until about five
in the afternoon when two horsemen rode
down the trail from puerto velasco one
was a native cavalryman who held both
horses while the other man dismounted
and walked to the waters edge where he
waved his hat at the steamer

  its the grimshaw boy said captain
holcomb fetch him aboard mr
jewell

  the young mining engineer who was
supposed to be checking up the comman-
deered dynamite rather than doing volun-
teer staff work was full of the excitement of
his first fight

  they kept pounding away all morning
till they had hammered both forts out flat
right after lunch flores sent in all his
steam-launches and other small fry to sweep
up the mines and a couple of landing-
parties to occupy the ruins guess he
thought both garrisons must have been
dead and buried by that time

  instead of which the soldados were
old smooth bores



strung out along the sand-dunes back of the
beach where theyd been hiding all the
time colonel paredes may be fat but he-s
no fool he let em come close in and then
cut loose with his gatlings and remingtons

  his fire-control was pretty good and
even equatan soldiers couldnt miss with
bullet-splashes to give the range only
one boat-load of floristas got as far as the
beach and they had the bad luck to pick
one of the likely places where old zeb tyler
had salted down some more of our dynamite

   after that the rest of the flotilla sort of
hung off and blazed away at eight hundred
they kept signaling for their big guns to
open up again and cover the landing
they opened up all right but they scared
their own side worse than they did us ill
bet those battleships hit everything this
side of the cordilleras

  something or other struck the llanero
one of the two florista torpedo-gunboats
and blew her into nine hundred little pieces
i thought it was a ten-inch canet shell from
the robusto falling short but zeb tyler
said it was one of the floating mines he
turned loose when the ebb began to run
after what ive seen of captain tyler in
action im disinclined to argue with him
hes convinced me that the merrimac
whipped the monitor

  he has has he rumbled ezra hol-
comb young man youd better keep

that sort of nonsense to yourself while youre
on my ship let me tell you so you beat off
the landing-party and the mine-sweepers
eh what did flores do after that

  sent in a flag-of-truce boat to notify us
that unless we surrender and let him in by
dawn tomorrow hell open fire on the city
at long range hes moved the conquis-
tador and the robusto in as close as he dares
and anchored them side by side in the fair-
way with their big guns tilted way up and
torpedo-nets out the two cruisers are on
either side of them and the vaquero and a
lot of picket-boats keeping watch to shore-
ward

  anything of the kind to seaward
  not that i could see captain

  well you trot along back and tell
colonel paredes to expect us somewhere
about midnight in his guarded tent said
ezra holcomb

  picking up his speaking-trumpet he
shouted the most amazing order ever given
on shipboard-

  all hands turn to and throw the ship
overboard

  masts funnel dummy boats ventila-
tors deckhouses and canvas-and-batten
topsides came down and splashed into the
lagoon revealing the flush deck and squat
turret of the monitor patria

  dum fools never noticed wed grown
nine foot shorter and two foot broader in
the beam chuckled abner jewell to grim-
shaw as he set the messenger ashore

  what would you have done if that gun-
boat had sent an officer aboard asked
grimshaw

  blown her out o water we had both
turret guns trained right on her inside our
canvas topsides then wed ha headed
inshore for the shoals where the big ships
dassent follow and trusted to the good
lord and bad gunnery hows that scare-
crow we rigged up on angostura shoal
still in place and looks from the forts
just like a half-sunken turret and funnel
its dollars to doughnuts the floristas
think the patria is still there

  theyll larn different betwixt now and
daylight said mr jewell shove off
boys

  say are you going to tackle two battle-
ships a couple of cruisers and a torpedo-
gunboat with that little old frying-pan
demanded grimshaw now standing on the
beach


adventure

  youd better ask capn holcomb bub
said the mate most of us fit with him in
the big war and larned to trust his jedg-
ment give way all

  the younger generation looked at the
monitor thought of the big modern krupps
and muttered sorrowfully-

  x will mark the spot

pretty lot o blockaders snort-
ed ezra holcomb later that night
lights a-blazing all hands jabber-
ing away like a treeful o parrakeets and
somebody tinklin a guitar guess they
didnt learn their trade off charleston
with her engines turning over just enough
to give her steerageway the patria crept in
on the strong flood tide that was rippling
past the cables of the two big ironclads
lying abeam of each other on either side of
the channel outside the mine-field with an-
chors out fore and aft to keep them bows-
on to the shore

  both the conquistador and the robusto
were citadel-type battleships with their
engines and main batteries inside a stout
iron fortress amidships the former car-
ried her four twelve-inch krupps in two
barbettes placed in diagonally opposite
corners of the central citadel so that all
four could be fired dead ahead or astern or
right abeam the french-built robusto
had a battery-plan that looked like the ace
of diamonds with a big gun at each angle
whereby she could train any three of them
on the same target

  both ships were so long and drew so
much water that they could not lie athwart
the channel without either grounding or
masking each others fire as they were
with their torpedo-nets out to ward off
drifting mines and all hostile guns sup-
posedly sunk or smashed their admiral
wasted no worries on possible attacks

  he was having trouble enough with his
own captains to judge from the acrimonious
language that came floating out of the
brightly lighted cabin where they were
holding a council of war that sounded as if
it were about to break up into a mutiny
within a mutiny everybody aft was too
much interested in trying to catch the drift
of the argument to notice the monitor drift-
ing silently up on their port quarter

  fire barked ezra holcomb into the
voice-tube leading from the conning-tower
down into the turret

  a four-hundred-and-fifty-pound solid
shot punched through the battleships thin
steel skin well abaft the central armor-belt
to port and a little above the water-line
passed through a few bulkheads and came
out to starboard a trifle below the water-
line a three-hundred-and-fifty-pound shell
having less penetrative power went only as
far as the angle between an empty coal-
bunker and the far side of the ship and
stayed there for three and a half seconds
when the time-limit on the fuse expired
several square yards of the conquistadors
starboard side opened up like a barn door
flooding both compartments

  theoretically both her soft ends could
have been shot full of holes without sinking
her or impairing her fighting value but to
cool her stifling tween-decks every water-
tight door had been left open so long that
most of them had rusted tight in the guides
before the excited greenhorn crew could
even try to close them solid water was
pouring across their thresholds and in
through the new shot-holes that were being
made every other minute as the patria
closed in and pounded grimly away

  traidor screamed admiral flores at
the astounded commander of the robusto
your ship is firing on mine

  would i then be here countered the
indignant and logical captain

   but the admiral was too excited to listen
besides where else could the shots possibly
come from search-lights were not yet
invented and equatan nights are dark

  buttons were pressed orders bawled
whistles blew bells clanged bugles sounded
the bosun piped signals flashed and all
hands asked questions and volunteered
advice while they scampered hither and
yon till they were more or less at battle
stations

  round swung the long barrels of the two
twelve-inchers in the conquistadors after-
barbette depressed as far as possible
they were fired at the flash of the hostile
guns but the mark was too close and low
crackling through the air above the patrias
turret both big shells hit and tore through
the astounded and righteously indignant
robusto that ship promptly responded
with everything she had

  down the narrow lane of water between
the two blazing thundering leviathans
floated the little monitor now tactfully
silent some of the saner florista officers
old smooth bores



caught the loom of her turret and funnel
against the gun-flashes across the way and
presently succeeded in stopping the panic-
firing but by that time the patria had
passed the robusto was listing to starboard
and the conquistador was sinking stern
foremost

  they were breaking out the robustos
ground-tackle and had just elaborately
fouled the starboard bower-anchor in the
forgotten torpedo-net when the monitor
edged up close under her bows and planted
one shell in the chain-locker and another in
the c p os quarters then rounding
the battleships ram as casually as if it had
been a cape with a lighthouse on it the
patria took up her station close under the
robustos uptilted port bow and alternated
shot and shell as fast as her stalwart gun-
crews could run in load serve the vent
run out train and fire with the guns right
abeam they kept both scuttles clear for
passing up ammunition and the shell-whips
and travelers busy

  machine guns rifles and even revolvers
crackled and spat unceasingly from every
possible point of the robustos towering top-
sides bullets drummed on the patrias
iron deck like hail on a tin roof while vi-
cious little three-and six-pounder hotchkiss
and nordenfelt shells hit and burst and re-
bounded all over the monitors turret and
conning-tower but the battleships big
guns that could have cracked the old cast-
iron skillet wide open with one fair hit
could not be depressed far enough to hit
anything so near

  sticking tight to her hulking helpless foe
the patria kept raking the robusto from
stem to citadel planting shell after burst-
ing shell between her shattered and up-
heaved decks then just as they un-
shackled the last of her cables and the
battleship began to get slowly and ponder-
ously under way flames shot up forward
and spread rapidly

  hit her paint-locker i guess thought
ezra holcomb sniffing the pungent smoke
hardwood decks paneled passageways
and worse cluttered up than an excursion-
steamer - shes nothing but an air-tight
stove with the kindling all in place reckon
i can leave her to her own devices time
for us to be moving on

  he rang four bells and the monitor slid
away into the dark so unexpectedly that the
gunners in the robustos port sponson missed

the chance they had been waiting for but
by now the rest of the fleet were under way
and closing in the steam launches and
cutters that had been on picket duty to
shoreward came hurrying back to see what
had happened and stumbled over the patria

  they swarmed excitedly all about the
slow-moving monitor banging away with
their gatlings and boat-howitzers and
sending up rockets to summon the cruisers
emboldened by the monitors silence-for
ezra was far too thrifty to waste bullets on
hornets-they ceased firing and dashed
alongside

  stand by to repel boarders shouted
ezra down the voice-tube as a couple of
hundred excited little equatan officers and
seamen tumbled aboard and charged across
the monitors deck where some of them
tripped over certain small round objects
that did not roll but seemed to be screwed
fast

  fire deck-clearers commanded hol-
comb above the boarders triumphant yells
and the clangor of gun-butts and hand-
spikes on the closed hatch-covers and port-
shutters already the floristas were scal-
ing the turret to drag him and his quarter-
master out of the conning-tower where the
two americans stood at bay with their
revolvers ready

  sighting through the peep-hole before
him holcomb pulled trigger and saw the
swarthy face of the man he shot lighted by
the flash of the colt but the sound of the
pistol-shot was swallowed up in the crashing
roar of the deck-clearers-an obscure
civil war invention long since forgotten
by most people but not by ezra holcomb
who had found these specimens in the
patrias shell-room and screwed them into
their sockets on deck with the fuses hang-
ing down below to be lighted when needed

  while still crouching down inside the
loving-cup to escape the pieces of iron
and other things that were humming past
and pattering down holcomb felt the mon-
itor abruptly heel far over to port and
heard a great wave break and rush foaming
across her low flush deck and the strangling
cries of those whom it swept struggling and
screaming into the sea for a moment he
thought the patria had struck a drifting
mine but she rolled back righted and
steamed on just as if nothing had happened

  it was no longer dark when ezra holcomb
stood up and looked about him ships and


adventure

sea and shore were lighted with a ruddy
glare from the burning robusto now afire
from stem to stern with flames spouting out
of every port and dead-light in her up-
heaved port side beyond her he could
make out the military masts but nothing
more of the conquistador a marbled
fire-lit cloud of smoke and steam hung over
the spot where she had gone down

  sunk by glory and blew up her bilers
most likely when she went under thats
what threw up that wave that swept our
decks i reckon hazarded holcomb put

all those poor burned and mangled -s

out of their misery quick and easy

  dents and stains on the monitors deck-
plates and a few struggling swimmers
among the overturned boats black against
the red waters astern were all that remained
of the hapless boarding-party but fresh
foes were already at hand bearing down
on the patria no longer hidden by darkness
came the torpedo-gunboat vaquero and the
cruisier esperanza

  hard-a-port commanded ezra as the
swift little gunboat flashed by to starboard
her hotchkiss guns barking spitefully

  but it was not of them he was thinking
but of the white streak that was unrolling
itself across the crimson water straight for
the monitors side the idle thought leaped
to holcombs mind that it looked like the
diagonal stripe on a confederate battie-
flag

  round swung the patrias bows in time
to let the whitehead flash harmlessly past
her starboard quarter but the change
of course brought her into the esperanzas
line of fire that cruiser was an old-
fashioned broadside ironclad ship-rigged
and with a wicked-looking ram curving
down beneath her bowsprit she disap-
peared behind a cloud of her own smoke as
her forward pivot and the long row of sixty-
four pounders in her starboard battery
spoke together

  then out she surged the white water
creaming up about her steel-shod stem in a
way that sent cold chills down the sturdy
back of the quartermaster at the patrias
helm for he saw that the two warships
were running on converging courses and at
relative speeds which in another five
minutes would bring them together at ex-
actly the right angle for the cruisers long
sharp ram to cut through the monitors
plates like scissors through tinfoil

  hold her steady grated holcomb as
the helmsman tried to ease her off

  knowing his skipper as he did the
quartermaster kept the patria on her
course though he could not keep from steal-
ing an occasional glance to port every
time he looked the cruiser was nearer and
bigger till she seemed right on top of them

  then she slowed and shivered to a stop
with the mud boiling up beneath her fore-
foot her fore-topmast crashing down and
all bedlam breaking loose on her deck
the patria slid safely by leaving the es-
peranza stuck hard and fast on an uncharted
and unsuspected sand-bar

  ill tend to you later you cafe-navi-
gators promised ezra holcomb as he
plodded out to seaward but just now
im busy  here comes that dratted little
spit-fire again

  the torpedo-gunboat was hurrying back
for another try deceived by the monitors
silence the vaqueros captain decided that
her turret must be jammed knowing the
quaint and picturesque habits of his own
primitive whiteheads he ran in and fired
both tubes at close range

  straight and true sped the first torpedo
to within fifty yards of the target when it
dipped and dived deep under her keel
the other maintained a proper depth but
jammed its rudder so that it swung round
the patrias stern and kept on swinging in
al circle

  holy halibut swore ezra holcomb
following its course with fascinated eyes as
the turret trundled round beneath him
its coming around to blow up its owners

  past the patrias bows circled the white
streak and curved right into the vaqueros
course just as they seemed at the point
of contact the monitors guns thundered
and hid everything with smoke through
the smoke-cloud ezra holcomb saw a great
leaping flash of flame and felt his cap blown
off by the wind of a fearful explosion tht
dazed and deafened him with its stupendous
roar when the smoke cleared the va-
quero had vanished blown into nothingness
by each and every whitehead aboard

  was it one of our shells or her own
torpedo i wonder mused ezra reckon
well never know anyhow i guess that
was the last of the floristas no by
thunder theres still the old primero de
abril well we ought to be able to take
her on single-handed
old smooth bores



  the one blockader left had been busy up
to now rescuing survivors from the robusto
and the conquistador she was of the same
type as the stranded esperanza but there
was one notable difference somebody
aboard her knew how to shoot

  the very first shell from her armstrong
pivot-gun burst squarely over the patrias
after-deck

  thats more like it said holcomb
appreciatively yankee or limey de-
serter probably train turret to star-
board he added down the voice-tube

  shes jammed sir came the reply

  steer  your own hook till further
orders cried holcomb to the quarter-
master as the skipper clambered out of the
loving-cup

  running across the turret roof he
dropped down to the deck and made an in-
vestigation soon he found the cause of the
trouble-a great segment of shell-casing
wedged tight between the deck and the
lower edge of the turret

  ezra holcomb stepped to the nearer
sight-hole and called-

  mr jewell

  aye aye sir

  send a working-party on deck with
sledges and drills pass the word to raise
spindle to extreme elevation and stand
by

  what was that sir asked the mate as
another shell hit and carried away some-
thing else with a ringing clang

  most of our smoke-stack coughed the
captain hurry up those engine-room
hands

  five grimy artificers bobbed up out of the
after-hatch and attacked the chunk of hot
iron that was keeping both guns out of
action it was a hard job made harder
by the blinding choking soft-coal smoke
blown forward from the ragged stump of
the funnel

  ill bring her head up into the wind
thought holcomb

  but before he could return to the conning-
tower a tremendous concussion knocked
him flat on deck when he picked himself
up there was no conning-tower left for him
to return to the cruisers third shell had
hit the loving-cup and blown it away
wheel quartermaster and all

  rig preventer-tackles tell the chief
to raise more steam and get steerageway on
her

  chief reports all flues choked with soot
when the smoke-stack went and no draft
since sir

  unable to steam steer or bring a gun to
bear the patria lay like a log

  all hands on deck shouted ezra hol-
comb shes going to run us down
straight for the drifting monitors star-
board side came the cruiser slowing as she
approached for only a touch of the ram
would be needed she was less than a
hundred yards away when men began to
shout and a gatling sputtered excitedly
from her port or shoreward side which
was in deep shadow for the burning wreck
of the robusto lay to seaward

  what are they shooting at wondered
holcomb

  torpedoed yelled abner jewell
torpedoed right amidships

  a sheet of flame and a spout of water shot
up alongside the primer de abril her
masts and yards reeled drunkenly against
the stars then heeled slowly over to port
as she began to fill and sink

  patria ahoy gasped a choking voice
from the sea

  its that sharpshootin deserter said
holcomb anybody who can shoot like
that is worth saving

  he hove a line at the darker spot in the
darkness that showed where the swimmer
was struggling and felt him catch and hang
on they drew in a man who was gripping
the line with one hand and with the other
supporting a senseless comrade

a teton fable

by frank h huston

johnny whoa haw mule-skinner
as his name implies sat in the tepi
of ta sunka nanji the standing
horse tenderly nursing with gin-
gerly finger-tips his bruised and battered
features venomously hissing through
swollen lips anathemas upon all the world
and the blue-bellies who had a few even-
ings previously thwarted his to him laud-
able endeavor to lift a certain desirable
half-bred horse that was herded with the
animals belonging to the troops of the post
not far away

  johnny had slipped out of the cheyenne-
arapaho camp on the lodge pole creek
sneaked into the herd and worked the ani-
mal of his choice to the edge of the grazing
bunch under cover of darkness when one
of the guards sensing something wrong in
the movements of the animal had with
commendable promptitude thrown a leaden
interrogation and later verbal challenge in
that direction the heavy  slug passing
directly under johnnys nose removing part
of his hirsute adornment and likewise his
personality from the locality with con-
siderable speed

  watan gaa the black coyote through
long association with sunka his ba-ni or
chum having acquired a working knowledge
of the white mans language followed
johnnys tale with interest as the latter
paused for breath the braves eyes twinkled
and with a glance at sunka who snorted
softly murmured-

 hecen tuwe womanan-

  thief- whats that he says about

a thief shunk im no thief whats
lifting a horse now and then in this country
and from the army at that

  its an old proverb johnny from a fable
of the sioux right appropriate too in the
premises didnt chuh never hear it lord
its told in every tribe and camp from the
big muddy to the rockies

  nah wots it all about

  gaall tell you he knows it better than
i do spill it ba-ni

  with a grave but malicious smile the indian
began imitating the tone and manner of one
of the professional tribal tellers of stories -
sunka wan-

  but whats it mean interrupted john-
ny impatiently tell me that first then
mebbe ill not want to hear the story
why a thief who joins himself with
more experienced thieves becomes more pro-
ficient and skilful in his chosen occupation
-is about as near as i can put it in en-
glish

  huh from johnny with a painful grin
at the two you-all want to take on
another pardner

  touche from sunka while gaa broadly
guffawed

  no johnny we strive to please but

yet harder to be honest-

  honest snorted the skinner you-

a play on his hosts name for sunka is dog
and ta sunka is medicine dog or horse
better take me in and learn me the busi-
ness he added

  you aint grown up enough yet johnny
mebbe well see bymebye but let gaa tell
the story if youve never heard it

  johnny subsided grumbling and the
indian softly resumed

  sunka wan ka wakanka wan wakin

wan tanka hnaka-

  as the skinner stirred restlessly and
seemed about to utter a protest he switched
to english

 arthur d howden smith

       author of fair salvage the iiccls of chanceetc

the first part of the story briefly retold in story form

qir gui de taberieof nerakin the marches
of outremer that formed the borderland between
the christian kingdom of jerusalem and the saracens
of saladin was a man of sudden impulses and strong
passions

  deep in his love fierce in his hate he left a heri-
tage to his only son matteo that might have crushed
the spirit of any man it was a heritage of shame
outlawry and the peril of an implacable vengeance

  sir gui had won his mate horazahde from the
desert overwhelming the caravan of the prince of
emesa who was despatching her to the emir el-afdel
as an unwilling bride and carrying her off to his
castle eerie

  she came to him willingly caught in the fire of
his romantic passion but she scorned the ties of
the church with which fray gilberto wished them
to be bound even when matteo was born she still
fiercely protested against the christian rite

  i am of the desert she exclaimed and i am
yours because you took me no hojji nor priest
could make me more your wife

  so the child grew to be a man adored by his
fathers retainers and accorded all the consideration
of a young prince he had the spirit of both the
frank and saracen fused in a leaping flame of
courage and loyalty

  his companion and instructor was ali maakwaa
the gentle-voiced but hard-hitting captain of
turcoples from him he learned something of the
art of war and from john the englishman his
fathers friend he got the gentle art of jongleurie-
the art of improvising ballads and setting them to
stirring strains-a rare art in days of daily strife

  there came a day when the vengeful prince of
emesa with his ally the emir el-afdel rushed out
of the desert in a slashing foray upon nerak
through treachery the castle was taken flames
swept the stronghold behind a heap of his enemies
the old lion finally fell and the fair horazahde died
with him

  turning as he fell the knight shouted above the
uproar

  live my son live matteo for vengeance

  ali maakwaa and the youthful matteo the only
survivors fled to the neighboring castle mardan
of the count renier de chappes but this knight
refused him help spuming him as an outcast with-
out a name he might have done him violence in-
stead but ali and matteo at the points of their
daggers won free-a bleak friendless world before
them and a tradition of hate behind

  matteo had once aided a refugee to escape from
manasses the son of renier de chappes and this
had intensified their hate on the other hand he
had gained the friendship of brygas reniers ward-
and a curious ring which kafur the grateful refugee
had hurriedly thrust upon him

  with only these memories of living friendship
matteo and his comrade turned their horses toward
the sea determined to secure the help of john the
englishman and messer gambaglio a genoese of
tripoli who had been his fathers banker

  equipped only with a gittem upon which matteo
strummed the accompaniments of his own ballads
they came to acre and embarked on an italian ship
for tripoli they were armed as men-at-arms pledged
to fight for the palrono if pirates attacked them

  on the third day a pirate ship bore down on them
grappled and drove the defenders in a struggling
mass back upon the poop here matteo caught
in the arms of the pirate chief felt that he was about
to die when the leader caught sight of his dagger-
hand and recoiled with a cry

  forgive me lord he mumbled thickly you
should have given me the sign	

  and he rapidly called off his pirates and pushed
clear

  matteo slipped kafurs ring-the ring of sinan-
lrom his finger and put it in his pouch

  a pirate may honor it said he but a christian
templar would cut its possessor down


a son of strife



  at tripoli they found the house of gambaglio
but the banker scornfully denied them demanding
proofs of identity that matteo did not possess

  in a murderous temper they sought out an inn
here they imposed upon the inn-keeper and pro-
cured a room

  a moment later the door flew open and gambaglio
entered falling upon his knees protesting that he
had only just had word from the patrono of the
pirates attack

  the sign exclaimed the genoese had you but

chapter xi

how matteo sang to prince bohemond

o	you are guis son

  john the englishman placed his
two hands on matteos shoulders
and squared him off so that they
stood eye to eye matteo saw a man whose
spare frame and youthful gaze gave the lie
to graying hair and deep-cut wrinkles in a
meditative face

  they met in a chamber of prince bohe-
monds palace overlooking the valley of
the orontes and the wide open spaces of
antioch set within the girdle of the gigantic
walls which traversed the surrounding
mountains and for this occasion matteo
had doffed his mail and stood clad in such
richly simple garb as became a squire who
presents himself at a fastidious court the
gittern the gray friars had given him was
slung across his back from a parti-colored
ribbon ali was below in the palace court-
yard hobnobbing with the soldiers of the
guard

  aye you are guis son repeated john
the englishman i would have known
you anywhere and gui is dead alas
what use is it now to say i warned him years
ago that god would seek him out for what
he did

  he bade me come to you said matteo
but if-

  nay nay you misunderstand me tis
no fault of yours your father did wrong fair
son i am not held in thrall by the church-
men and i have my own opinions on such
matters but we must look facts in the
face i like you i will do for you what
i may but you start life with a heavy
disability

  for what men say i care little an-
swered matteo haughtily i have my
sword for those who cross me

  oh aye spoken like a warrior but
have you no ambitions

told me you could have had whatever you sought

  why

  because you speak for the lord of death and
i too am of the cirde of agents of the old man of
the mountain

  when the banker had gone matteo looked dazed-
ly at his comrade the turcople

  ali heard you what i heard

  lord stammered ali there was talk of this

and that-an old man-great treasure-

  aye mused matteo grimly and of vast peril

  matteo thought for a moment

  two messer john

  and those

  i would sing songs compose romaunts
live as you have lived and i would wreak
vengeance on my enemies

  i see you carry a gittern ho humph
but who are these enemies the prince of
emesa and his ally-what did you call him
el-afdel

  aye and renier de chappes who would
not stir a finger to punish the murderers of
my mother and who will take what is rightly
mine if the king permits

  of de chappes i say naught i never
liked the man but touching the other
matteo achmet-ibn-muros is your grand-
father

  matteos face darkened

  does it matter what he is to me-save
that he slew my father and my mother
what a land what a land murmured
john the englishman to himself

he paced back and forth across the room
but in this scheme of life you have laid
down there is no place for love he pointed
out coming to a halt again before matteo

what time have i for love responded
matteo nay messer john whom shall

i	love i have a fortune sufficient to a
career belike but what maid would wed
with me nor do i think on that side of
life i shall sing songs and hate my
enemies-and perchance slay them in time
john the englishman shook his head
you have much to learn he said brief-
ly love matteo is the greatest force
in the world love fetched me hither into
outremer out of faraway england-and
now love forces me to tarry when i might
otherwise be passing a comfortable old age
in a safe castle on my own welsh marches
for know you there are many kinds of
love of which love of women is the chief
and after that love of a land or a good
cause may be reckoned next best

he fell into a muse and matteo stared


adventure

 at him puzzled by this whimsical phi-
 losophy

 but you spoke of singing songs con-
 tinued the old jongleur arousing himself
 do you know aught of the jongleurs
 craft

 nay messer john said matteo blush-
 ing who am i that i should make pretense
 to art before you

 at least you carry a gittern returned
 john the englishman smiling pick me
 a lay	

 matteo swung his instrument into place
 and swept the strings with practised fingers

 a lay of womans love by your leave
 he said with an answering smile such as
 you were pleased to uphold against my
 ignorance

hark to the lay of ysabeau

            ysabeau the fair

she was a maid of slender form

sun-gold was her hair

          but never a man had seen her-

she dwelt in a castle tall-

           and a giant like a cedar
            glowered across the wall

 the arras covering the doorway of the
 chamber was pushed aside and a young
 squire with a pleasant open face bowed to
 john the englishman the old jongleur
 motioned apologetically to matteo who
 thrust the gittern behind him

 what is it de pugne he asked

 i crave your pardon messer john an-
 swered the squire but prince bohemond
 sends urgent summons

 a frown knitted the brow of john the
 englishman

it is-

 he paused significantly

aye lord he hath been seized again

 the jongleur turned to matteo

 our lord the prince is subject to attacks
 of a melancholic affection he explained
 to say sooth matteo bohemond is a sad
 case of wasted youth now he is persuaded
 he hath nothing to live for

 without you to divert him i know not
 what we would do messer john said the
 young squire gratefully

 you exaggerate de pugne returned
 john the englishman laughing and here
 is a voice that makes mine sound like the
 clanking of rusty armor

 he clapped his hand on matteos shoul-
 der

aye lad i mean it he went on noting

matteos look of startled deprecation if
you have the gift of composition your for-
tune as a jongleur is secure

  the squire stepped forward eagerly

  a suggestion messer john there is
naught which entertains the prince more
readily than something new perhaps this

youth-

  it might be admitted john what
say you matteo will you put your fortune
to the proof bohemond is a savage lord

and in these tempers- but i would not

guide you decide for yourself

  matteo picked up his cap from a chair

  i will try what i may do messer john
he said quietly

  good if you please bohemond your
future is assured he is generous with
those he likes come we will go to him
but first you must know messer francois
de pugne one of the princes body squires
this is matteo de nerak son of an old
friend of mine de pugne

  i greet you well messer matteo said
the squire and his clear straightforward
glance assured matteo of loyal friendship

  the three walked through the long cor-
ridors of the palace into the farther wing
tall foot-sergeants grounded partizans and
stood aside to let them pass servants
parted the thick hangings and they en-
tered a great chamber walled and vaulted
with stone its open windows drawing in the
breezes of the neighboring gardens on a
throne-like chair at the opposite end crouch-
ed a gaunt-featured pallid man in early
middle age with his chin cupped in his
hand and his eyes staring gloomily before
him

  ha john he said in a lifeless voice
you are come at last i need you what
a curse of desolation is this world

  a curse nay lord the sickness of
the mind is upon you but we shall soon

dispel it see i-

  the prince straightened in his chair
who is with you he demanded with
displeasure i asked for you john not
for whoever chanced to be with you send
the youth away

  it shall be as you wish answered john
the englishman soothingly but he is a
jongleur of rare promise i thought twould
divert you lord to hear another voice an
echo out of the kingdom of youth which
time hath wrested from me no less surely
than from you
a son of strife



  bohemond glared down at matteo from
the throne

  youth i would give all antioch for
youth boy can you make me forget my
lost youth can you make me forget the
slight the emperor of byzantium hath put
upon me i am not good enough to wed his
daughter i bohemond prince of an-
tioch i am not good enough to mate
with the spawn of the comnenoi phaugh
he shall pay for it he shall yet crawl to
me

  i had fitted out galleys for an escort for
the bride now they shall ravage the
greek coasts blood will wipe out the
insult aye blood will wipe it out

  the prince leaned back exhausted

  i am in no mood to hear sickly romaunts
of love i warn you he croaked you
had best try me another time

  nay i will try you today with your
leave lord said matteo firmly

  if you will returned the prince indif-
ferently at the least- a saturnine
grimace twisted his face-i shall have the
opportunity of venting my spleen upon you
if you annoy me go on boy

  john the englishman looked doubtfully
at matteo

  not the romaunt you started for me
he whispered

  matteo only nodded his fingers plucked
from the strings of the gittern a wild tumult
of melody the roar of a conflict war-cries
screams of the dying the crack of breaking
spears the crash of opposing chargers
clank of weapons on armor bohemonds
eyes brightened he sat erect the room
became very quiet

  harken to me began matteo i shall
recite to you the deeds of our ancestors i
shall tell you how the host of the crosses
mustered from every corner of europe
how they traveled in storm and in sunshine
across the countries of the world and burst
like a flood upon the paynims i shall tell
you how they traversed the land of asia
and how they conquered nicea robais
acre and jerusalem but above all how they
won the great city of antioch which sat
secure behind walls like mountains built by
men upon the tops of gods mountain i
shall tell you of all the noble lords and
warriors who did these deeds of godfrey de
bouillon and his brother baldwin of hugh
the great of tancred but above all of

   such an occurrence did befall about this time

bohemond the founder of a line of warriors
always in the forefront of battle

  the chanson dantioch muttered the
squire de pugne

  aye whispered john the englishman
do but watch bohemond

  as matteo continued into the rimed
verses of the main body of the narrative
his gittern interpreting the spirit of the
words as he sang or recited the hunted look
disappeared from the princes face his
eyes gleamed at reference to the exploits of
his mighty ancestor first of the princes of
antioch the tenseness left him he sat
easily interested absorbed his twitching
hands at rest

  an hour passed and matteo never
faltered his voice rang true his fingers
were sure on the strings time dwindled
into nothingness the three who listened
forgot themselves in the magic of tone and
melody other hours flew by and john the
englishman commenced to wonder whether
matteo could support the effort much longer
once john was tempted to interfere but he
dreaded to break the spell which wrapped
bohemond so the afternoon waxed toward
evening and just as the first shadows barred
the room matteo concluded the description
of the siege of antioch and the capture of
the gate of st george by bohemond i and
his little band of sixty men

  an end to my tale o prince he pro-
claimed in a voice that clanged through the
high-vaultered room as your fathers be-
fore you live in history by the splendor of
their deeds so shall you too be remembered
by those who come after you

  the prince drew a deep breath

  pardi messer jongleur he cried
who are you that have charmed me out
of myself

  your servant lord matteo de nerak
you have pleased me matteo aye
once more this night i may sit with my
knights and take joy in being alive for
these past hours you won me back my
youth what may i do to reward you
grant me leave to abide at your court
prince

  nav i shall not let you depart come
hither

  bohemond stripped from his person a
heavy golden chain and hung it about the
youths neck

  take this i beg you as earnest of the
favor which shall be yours tis gold but no


adventure

more golden than your voice ha by our
lady the ring on your finger that ring
where got you that ring

the prince started back with hands up-
flung as if to defend himself against attack
john de pugne tis an assassin
the two rushed forward aghast un-
certain

nay lord i know the youth protested
john the englishman his father was my

friend what-

  look at that ring commanded bohe-
mond pointing with a shudder at matteos
hand

  silently matteo held up the ancient silver
circlet with its device of the triple-bladed
knife

  the ring of sinan gasped john the
englishman

  his face became grim and watchful
  speak quickly boy he said are you

in sooth whom you claim or some foul-

  i am matteo de nerak answered
matteo calmly as for this ring tis what
you call it i had it from one for whom
i did a chance kindness i had supposed
it a talisman of power but your words make
me suspect it is an evil omen

   tis the signet of the old man of the
mountain said de pugne

  that i know admitted matteo

  and do you not know that he is the
enemy of all other princes demanded
bohemond

  now you speak of it i do recall being
told so but i am no agent of sinan it
helped bring me hither

  how questioned the prince

  that is a lengthy tale lord

  bohemond settled back in his chair with
a smile of satisfaction

  get you about the telling of it he said
nay john i am persuaded the youth
speaks the truth this is rare good fortune
i must have my pleasure while i can tell
all messer matteo

  so matteo told in detail how he haden-
countered kafur on the judean hills how
he had helped the assassin to escape how
he had journeyed to tripoli and how a
merchant there-some instinct prompted
him to withold messer gambaglios name-
had accepted his identity after sight of the
ring and rendered up to him his fathers
treasures

  name the merchant ordered the prince
sharply at this point doubt not he is one

through whom sinan works to slay those
whom he hath marked for death

   but lord if i name him it will be known
that i betrayed him and sinan will slay
me

   bohemond pondered this for a moment
true he agreed finally well so be
it messer matteo i have a fancy for you
you shall abide at antioch and messer
john shall teach you certain niceties of the
jongleurs art which you have not yet
learned de pugne take heed to the needs
of messer matteo lodge him with the
squires of the household john attend me
to the great hall

chapter xii

how matteo changed his mame

mo matteo hast heard the news
ie pugne dashed into the room
where the jongleur was sitting scratching
toilsomely with an iron pen upon a fair
sheet of the tough paper that saracen mer-
chants brought from cathay

   fair as the moons pellucid rays mut-
tered matteo to himself rays rays

ways-says-days aye days it shall-

   certes you are a very clerk rapped
de pugne give over your love rimes
st benedict you who know naught of
women becoming a singer of love romaunts
it passeth belief

   fair as the moons pellucid rays re-
peated matteo thoughtfully  tis more
sugary than i like yet- what was it you
said francois

   i said there was news

  as what

   the king is here

  the king what king

   matteo rose in his astonishment

   ha at last you are touched triumphed
de pugne why who but the king of
jerusalem

   amalric what doth he here

   he tarries to visit bohemond on his
return from a sojourn at the court of the
emperor of constantinople even now his
company are within the city hark you
may hear the trumpets of the princes guard
sounding in the courtyard

   as de pugne spoke the silvery clamor of
the trumpets rang through the open win-
dows there was a noise of heralds voices
deep and resonant then a mighty cheering
a son of strife



  matteo ran to the window up the
broad street which led to the palace poured
an imposing procession of knights and men-
at-arms headed by a huge man on a broad-
backed war-horse whose helm was en-
circled by a golden crown

  why there are womens head-dresses
amidst the helmets he cried

  aye amalric is companioned by queen
maria and some of her ladies but haste
matteo i came hither that you might miss
naught bohemond was taken by surprize
yet he desires to make a brave showing
against the kings court bring your gittern
and come to the hall of audience per-
chance you shall entertain the king and his
lords

  perchance i shall not growled matteo
nevertheless taking his instrument from
the table i have no kind feeling for
amalric twas he sanctioned the seizure
of my fathers fief by that foul cur de
chappes

  what else might the king do returned
de pugne reasonably walking by matteos
side nerak is a fortess of the desert
march which holds the approaches to
jericho twas in ruins ungarrisoned
amalric hath no money to rebuild fortresses
and hire men-at-arms he was forced to
give it to the lord who was able to resume
its defense

  there were other lords than renier de
chappes retorted matteo who sat idly
by while my father and mother were slain
nay francois put yourself in my place

  i would that i might replied de pugne
promptly i am a squire of unknown
name who may be a knight a year hence
you are the most famous jongleur of
outremer-and all in two years time why
i remember the day i burst into messer
johns chamber and first heard you singing
the lay of ysabeau and afterward you
charmed bohemond out of a black mood as
you have done many times since god wot
but then you were a youth of less account
than i while now men come from jeru-
salem and tripoli and cyprus and by-
zantium and even armenia to hear your
romaunts-

  have done have done laughed mat-
teo brought to good humor in spite of him-
self some part of what you say is sooth
francois yet i would have you consider
that your name if unknown is honorable
and mine-

  he broke off as they entered the hall of
audience from the rear of the dais whereon
three chairs were placed around it were
ranged the lords and ladies of the court of
antioch with a fringe of jesters jongleurs
tumblers and squires and upper servants
standing in front of the central of the three
chairs was prince bohemond in a scarlet
robe edged with miniver by the great
entrance doors waited the heralds and pur-
suivants ready to announce the kings en-
trance john the englishman from his
place near the prince hailed matteo and
de pugne and they edged their way toward
him through the crowd

  right glad am i to have a word with
you dear lad he whispered flinging an
arm around matteos shoulders you
must know de chappes is with the king
but heed my counsel and give him no
attention bohemond will bid you to sing
and i would not have you put out by meet-
ing the eye of your enemy

  matteos face flamed with color but he
made no answer indeed at that moment
a squire ran up to the entrance of the hall
and the heralds set trumpets to their lips
and blew a fanfare

  ho lord of antioch cried a pursuivant
who stepped forward between them
hither approaches the dread lord amalric
anointed of the lord of hosts protector
of the holy sepulcher king of jerusalem
count of jaffa and ascalon

  again the trumpets blared outside
there was the sound of cheering then
with clashing weapons and clanking mail
a host of warriors tramped into the hall
their grim ranks starred with womens
finery and many a lovely face but mat-
teos gaze was fastened upon one who
walked immediately behind the king and
the dark sour-visaged grecian queen a
youth whose splendid stature and lion mane
of yellow hair were at variance with his
boyish counterance

  see whispered matteo to john the
englishman who is the youth who fol-
lows the king

   tis the prince baldwin returned the
old jongleur they say he hath qualities
beyond any who have borne the name

  a fair welcome to your graces said
bohemond descending from the dais to
offer an arm to the queen

  ha prince we greet you well boomed
amalric in the voice of a man-at-arms his


adventure

blond bulk in striking contrast with the
swart leanness of bohemond

  they met as equal sovereigns for antioch
owed no definite feudal obligation to jerusa-
lem nor indeed to any other lord save an
occasional emperor of constantinople who
was prepared to go to the expense of com-
pelling respect and while they talked upon
the dais their two followings were seeking
out acquaintances and a buzz of conversa-
tion filled the hall john the englishman
was hailed by a dozen friends of hard-
fought fields

  matteo hung back conscious of a re-
currence of his former sullen distaste for the
whole affair de pugne through loyalty
remained with him rather than sift about
and hark to the gossip of jousts and battles
which he craved

  matteo marked down de chappes in the
group of lords attending the king and stared
at him with squared jaw and lowering
eyes

  i will stay no longer he said suddenly

to de pugne bide and-

  but messer john is just beckoning to
you appealed de pugne

  it was true and matteo could not avoid
obeying the old jongleur turned as he
approached

  hither matteo he said here is one
hath heard of you and must needs command
a romaunt

  aye that must i exclaimed an eager
boys voice and matteo found himself look-
ing into the blue eyes of prince baldwin
by the cross messer matteo there is
none like you for stirring the blood in my
veins with tales of knightly deeds and my
governor messer william the archdeacon
of tyre holds that in times to come men
will read what you have composed as they
do now the learning of the ancient romans
he saith too much protested matteo
i think not and will you sing me a
romaunt messer matteo aye you shall
and the boy laughed merrily

  ho he cried in a voice that was almost
a mans in timbre dear lord my father-
and you too lord bohemond-i have laid
a command upon messer matteo the jon-
gleur that he sing a romaunt for us
bohemond flashed one of his rare smiles
at the impetuous lad

  you know a great jongleur without being
instructed lord baldwin he said how
say you lord king shall we support your

fair son there is none to equal messer
matteo in outremer men say

  aye so rumbled amalric by my
five bones let him sing after a good fight
there is naught to be preferred to a good
song stand forth messer matteo

  the lords and ladies drew back and mat-
teo found himself in the midst of a circle
he bowed to the three on the dais and again
to the royal boy who had singled him out
for favor by this time he was accustomed
to entertaining numerous companies and
he fingered the strings of his gittern with
absent-minded precision considering which
of his newer pieces he should select he
chose the road to antioch one of his
chansons de toy age which was then still in
process of composition it began

this is the road to antioch the merry shipman
      cried

many a man hath traveled it and many another
      died

   but you and i shall find a lass
   in every tavern that we pass

and all the robbers by the way will blink at us
      whereer we stay

because we have no bursting packs or clanking
      harness on our backs

   but only just a blithesome song
   to while the weary leagues along

  all the incidents of the road he wove into
his theme and his listeners were regaled
with the gossip of castle monastery and
tavern with the opinions of merchants
pilgrims clerks villeins burghers nobles
great ladies and ladies of questionable virtue
as overheard by himself and the mythical
shipman who was the clown of the tale
laughter intermingled with applause and
the chanson concluded on the note of high
endeavor which was dear to a chivalrous
company

  pardi messer jongleur you sing pret-
tily applauded king amalric mayhap
my cousin of antioch will permit that you
visit us at jersualem doubt not we shall
honor you in your degree

  i can ill afford to part with messer
matteo said bohemond

  ha fair cousin but you will let him
come in time will you not begged bald-
win certes he sings like those jongleurs
the lords of provence lament when they
come overseas doth he not messer
john

  there is none better lord agreed john
the englishman gaily and i have been a
jongleur of some renown in my own day
a son of strife



  heed him not lord interceded matteo
he hath forgotten more romaunts than i

know

  his fame is secure said baldwin with
friendly impartiality as is yours messer
matteo although you are so young prithee
visit us at jerusalem there is no largesse
i could grant you here to represent my
appreciation but in my fathers palace i
may do better

  lord i have had largesse enough in the
kindness of your thoughts returned mat-
teo bowing low and he withdrew himself
apart anxious to escape the curious eyes that
had watched his interview with the prince

  but he could not elude de pugne the wily
squire sought him out in the niche he found

  you slip about like an eel complained
francois look you matteo who is the
demoiselle in the yellow gown she who hath
the group of knights and squires about her
nay not that one she is looking this way
indeed she hath eyes for none but you
belike she knows you

  what demoiselle should i know re-
torted matteo nay tis i who should
ask of you

  but he looked in the direction de pugne
indicated perceived the yellow gown idly
studied the flower face of its wearer-and
abruptly realized that she was brygas de
kergac the same brygas beyond a doubt
who had ridden beside him and cheered his
defiance of her guardian and uncle the
same yes but with a difference this
brygas was slim and lissom as the one he
remembered but there was a poise a car-
riage an assurance of manner that had not
been there before

  you know her exclaimed de pugne in
his ear my faith she is the fairest maid
ever i saw prithee make me known to
her is her father a very great lord

  i know her yes acknowledged matteo
but her guardian is my enemy

  well let us go across to her he is not
by at the moment but who is that squire
glowering at her elbow

  matteo followed the nod of de pugnes
head another surprize in his absorption
he had ignored the presence of manasses
de chappes grown into a loutish young man
with a spoiled arrogant face lacking the
ruthless power of his fathers

  her cousin an ill-minded fellow he
said as they crossed the hall toward her
how now messer matteo she greeted

him while manasses slouched aside are
you grown so great that you have no
memories for those who were friends of
your obscurity

  not so lady and here is my good friend
messer de pugne ready to make amends
for my churlishness

  messer de pugne is welcome for him-
self she answered sweetly but prithee
messer matteo must you rely upon an-
other to save you

  i trow not yet i would have you recall
that your uncle is my enemy

  her face sobered

  aye you would not forget-or forgive
i might have known it

  i am human he said shrugging his
shoulders

  so human you must bear malice even
against me

  nay lady why must you strive to put
me in the wrong he denied indignantly

  what say you messer de pugne she
asked the squire who had been a silent
listener to this debate

  he is wrong indeed lady declared de
pugne

  a group of young knights and squires
pressed closer about them as king amalric
and prince bohemond left the room for the
banquet hall adjoining

  who is it presumes to monopolize the
lady brygas demanded one of them
ho de pugne i rode with you against
haranc

  i remember you replied de pugne
this is messer matteo de nerak the

jongleur my friend-

  and eke mine amended brygas
what messer jongleur did i not catch
you red-handed in your first adventure
you did lady admitted matteo

  there was a commotion in the outer
circle and manasses de chappes forced
himself in front of matteo

  perchance your latest adventure is con-
fined to making use of a name to which you
have no right he sneered

  what mean you asked matteo even
voiced

  your friends call you matteo de nerak
since when did you own title to nerak
or are you one of the villeins of the fief
if so by what right are you here

  shame cried brygas

  others in the group murmured but mat-
teo motioned for silence


adventure

  hear me messers he said tensely in
some sort what this fellow says is true i
have no title in law to nerak which was
my fathers hold renier de chappes per-
mitted the saracens to burn it and slay

my parents-

  the saracens avenged the rape of your
mother by your father snarled de chappes

  -and when all was safe and i the
orphan without standing before the law
had fled continued matteo as if he had
not heard the interruption he secured the
fief from the king he did not win it
messers he sat by and saw a braver lord
slaughtered so that he might expand his
lands

  nerak is his today it is not mine and
from this day i am no longer matteo de
nerak i am matteo dantioch

  he swung around upon de chappes

  art satisfied he inquired

   tis a sign you begin to realize your
place conceded manasses contemptuously

  nay i am not finished with you said
matteo smiling by this buffet am i not
and he struck manasses across the mouth
so fiercely that he reeled to the floor

  ah dear god beseeched brygas do
not fight with him messer matteo you
have naught to win by it

  i have a long-awaited revenge to satis-
fy returned matteo grimly

  nay nay you are mad

manasses jumped up purple with rage
you know well i would not fight with a
saracen dog like you he yelped i may
not soil my steel upon your bastard hide
matteo turned to the group surrounding
them

  what say you messers he asked

  you are in the right so far messer
matteo declared the young knight who
had recognized de pugne i am allier
de st roque and i ride with the lord
balian dibelin

why should i fight him protested
manasses he is not of knightly blood
he is of better blood than you cried
de pugne and if you do not fight him i
will whip you from the city

  brygas stood weeping and wringing her
hands

  he will fight promised the young
knight de st roque

  what talk of fighting do i hear cut
in a new voice and prince baldwin thrust
a path into the heart of the group

  at his heels strode john the englishman
a worried look on his lined face

   tis i have challenged messer de
chappes spoke up matteo

you messer de nerak and why
for that messer de chappes challenged
my honor and my right to the name de
nerak the last i conceded to him hence-
forth i am matteo dantioch

  yet still i do not understand the bicker
said baldwin bewildered

  if it please you lord interrupted john
the englishman messer matteo is son
to the former lord of nerak

  ha so i perceive the merits of the
case said baldwin softly

  a harsh bleak look covered his blond
features their immaturity vanished as by
magic

  the point was not a knightly one to
take messer de chappes he said curtly
you disgrace my fathers court prithee
retire to the fleet at st simeon there to
await our coming

  de chappes squared his shoulders and
strove to effect a jaunty air as he left the
room but none of his comrades gave him so
much as a glance of sympathy

  as for you messer matteo continued
the prince with a hint of reproval you are
wise enough to know that it could not have
advanced your fortunes had you slain a
guest of prince bohemond on a festival day
nay i blame you not but consider my
words and be guarded accordingly

  he put his hand on the arm of john the
englishman in sign that he wished to retire
the ranks of the group opened before him
and he walked beside the old jongleur to
the banquet hall

  there passes a king said brygas and
one who hath been a good friend to you
messer matteo dantioch you do well to
change your name tis worthy of the place
you have won by your own efforts as be-
cometh a valiant knight

 yet i am no knight protested
matteo

  knighthood is not confined to gilded
spurs nor doth it require the stroke of the
accolade to impart its virtues she an-
swered gently am i not right messer
de st roque

  he bowed over her hand

  those very words were instilled into my
mind by my dear lord balian he replied
i count messer matteo dantioch-or de
a son of strife

nerak-or whatever else he chooses to call
himself-my friend

  others murmured assent and extended
their hands to matteo

  we are of the native-born declared a
squire we weary of the pretensions of
foreign adventurers like de chappes

  a truce to politics laughed brygas
am not i too an adventurer

  nay nay they answered her you
are the queen of beauty

  it seemed to matteo an apt title his
heart beat faster as he heard it

  aye so shall you be he said bending
his knee to her and i do proclaim you as
such in this realm of antioch eke jerusalem
with countship and wardship baronage and
admiralty over all who love and woo

  a warm light blazed in her eyes as she
leaned down and smote him lightly on the
shoulder

  rise messer matteo she bade him
you are knight to my grace and as first
jongleur of outremer shall be charged with
due proclamation of all loving encounters
and chronicling of such passages at hearts
as may ensue

  the knights and squires clapped their
hands and applauded

  a right merry wit they confided one
to another

  certes this messer matteo is a proper
person even though he be a bastard as de
chappes hath charged said de st roque
to de pugne

  he is as good a man of his hands as he
is of his voice replied frangois but
never before did i see him permit a woman
to cozen him

  there was a hint of jealousy in these last
words the young knight laughed

  it comes in time to all he said  tis
like a romaunt of his own i would give
much to see the face of messer renier when
he hears what hath happed this day

chapter xiii

to massiaf

it was after the banquet that night that
john the englishman came to matteos
chamber

  what madness possessed you fair son
he asked gently thanks to st george
i overheard in passing the bicker betwixt
you and that varlet de chappes and fetched

prince baldwin to end it in the only way
possible

   twould have been best had i fought
and slain him replied matteo sullenly

  how would that have advanced you
bohemond must have banished you from
his court at the least you are on the
threshold of great fame why defer your
recognition

  but they are my enemies messer john
some day i must slay them

  alack sighed the old jongleur wearily
there is that in the blood of the folk of
this wild land which breeds hate and intem-
perance whither will your revenge carry
you

  i know not admitted matteo

  ave you know not mayhap if you
do not learn in time revenge hath a sour
savor in the mouth twill carry you whither
you like not

  even so shall i not make sorrow re-
torted matteo i have been thinking the
nonce of taking my case to king amalric
to what purpose

  i would demand my rights

  nay but what are your rights matteo
matteo tossed himself into a chair fum-
ing with rage

have i none then he demanded
none lad even the treasures the mer-
chant in tripoli holds for you you may be
sure of principally because you wear the
ring of sinan

  would the king deny me all justice
cried matteo

  not justice but rights aye for even if
the king heard you his barons would resist
yielding up a border fortress to you

   tis unfair-

  unfair and wicked i grant you lad-
and no fault of yours yet tis fact you
must face it as fact

  matteo tossed slumberless through the
night but in the morning and throughout
the brief visit of the court of jerusalem he
took pains to avoid his enemies with entire
success since manasses was in disgrace
aboard the royal galleys at the port of st
simeon and messer renier was occupied
with affairs of state

  but of brygas and the young prince
baldwin he saw much and he found equal
joy in the feminine charm of one and the
frank admiration of the other the charm
of brygas was elusive in quality vague dis-
turbing for one who had been unobservant


adventure

of women outside the pages of manuscript
scrolls and the gestes and romaunts of
brother jongleurs

  when she departed at the end of the
week matteo was conscious of an emptiness
in his life that he had never known before
yet it was an emptiness without pain and
in the swift progress of events the sweep
and pomp and pageantry of the court the
occasional clash of war on the marches he
had no time to lament the loss of a girl who
after all he thought of always as the niece
of a mortal enemy

  so passed another year the influence
matteo had secured over the sinister bohe-
mond won him additional fame lords
and knights came to antioch especially to
hear this matchless jongleur with the golden
voice other jongleurs and trouveres
journeyed to compare notes with him and

his master john the englishman or per-
chance in jealousy to seek to oust him
from his dominance of their art bohemond
delighted to honor him as an ornament of
the court he had all that youth can de-
sire-all save love and he was not assured
in his mind that he desired love

  the court of antioch vied with jerusalem
as a center of chivalry it was a training
school for knights and in its lists matteo
was hardened in feats of arms for he did
not confine himself to service in the palace
any more than did john the englishman
whose counsel in war was sought by the
wiliest leaders if the saracens raided from
aleppo or the armenians from mamestra
the jongleurs rode with the host in the
assize of arms

  it was in the beginning of the fourth year

of matteos sojourn at antioch that ali
maakwaa came to him in perturbation one
morning with a sealed roll of parchment

  one in a cloak slipped by me in the
palace court and placed this in my hand
said the old turcople he said twas for
my master before i could question him he
was gone

  matteo turned the roll in his hand the
seal was of black wax and stamped upon it
was the device of the hand grasping the
triple-bladed knife

  why did you not follow he asked

  i did but there was a crowd

  belike it matters not said matteo
and slit the seal

  the script was in arabic

   sinan lord of death sheikh-al-jebal master
of paradise deliverer of the word to the jongleur
matteo of antioch once of nerak in the land
beyond jordan cl reeling in the name of the
unknown

   the hour hath arrived when a measure of the
vengeance contemplated may be achieved and
power added to that which a certain ring hath aided
in procuring death shall be the portion of those
who are your enemies and mine and those of the
lord you serve to this end you shall wait upon
me at the castle of massiaf let no time be lost
in obeying my summons

   this is the word of sinan

  is it evil tidings messer matteo
asked ali

  nay i know not replied matteo
thoughtfully perchance it means a
worthy adventure it bodes death for
some but i must seek speech with the
prince and messer john

  he found the two playing at chess and
bohemond studied the message eagerly as
always hungry for the unusual for aught
that would divert his somber mind

  you cannot interpret its meaning he
asked finally

  nay lord

  what think you john inquired the
prince handing the parchment to him

  the old jongleur read it twice then
glanced keenly at matteo

  what is your thought he asked

  matteo shrugged his shoulders

   tis an opportunity for adventure he
said i have had experience of the power
of sinan as you wot i am interested to
test it further

  john the englishman nodded his head

  much have i heard of this enchantcd
castle of massiaf he remarked but never
a son of strife



have i met the man who could truthfully
say he had set eyes upon it many a foray
have the templars dispatched into the
country of the assassins to seek it out but
never have they glimpsed its turrets so
far may a christian ride alive through these
mountains a league beyond he is a corpse
save he turn back

  my counsel lord is that you permit
matteo to obey

  aye agreed the prince for tis in my
mind that he should have a rare tale to tell
upon his return how will you go matteo
certes i know not

  massiaf by all reports interrupted
john the englishman is in the mountains
of lebanon inland from jebleh you must
be wary of the templars matteo for they
would slay even you did they suspect you
of traffic with sinan the princes safe-
conduct would not protect you in such a
case

  i will use care dear lord and if i live
 will make a new geste for you lord prince
that you shall not soon tire of

  the chess-board was abandoned and the
prince and john the englishman vied with
each other to aid in the hurried preparations
that matteo found necessary ali was over-
joyed at the prospect of bearding the old
man of the mountain in his castle for to
say truth the oldturcople often grew tired
of the ordered routine of the palace and the
confinement of antiochs walls his idea
of a happy life was a border keep with fre-
quent excursions against the enemy a free
hand at plunder and death ever riding at
his saddle-bow

  by st bacchus and allah who ought
to be a saint he exclaimed as they rode
out of the palace courtyard followed by the
envious farewells of de pugne-now a full-
fledged knight-and others of the court
this is the best venture ever we have been
upon messer matteo and it shall go ill with
us if we do not win rich booty

  we are not after booty old wolf
laughed matteo we are riding into the
jaws of death to match wits with one who
rails himself the lord of death if we win
free with life and a new song to sing i shall
be satisfied

  each to his liking grumbled ali you
would take a song instead of a gold bangle
any day

  they rode out by the river gate and fol-
lowed a road leading southward parallel to

 the coast but some seven or eight leagues
 inland they had not traveled far when
 they caught up with a man dressed as an
 italian merchant who rode one pony and
 led another carrying well-stuffed paniers
 a fair day lord he hailed them

 fair enough returned matteo shortly
 not desirous of intercourse with a stranger

 but the man kneed his pony over to their
 side of the road

 you ride to jebleh he asked

 in that direction admitted matteo

  tis a parlous stretch lord will you
 lend me the grace of your company for your
 own sake as well as mine

 nay denied matteo  know you not
 on the road the stranger is not always the
 friend

 why that is wisely spoken but are you
 sure that i am a stranger

 matteo stared at the mans dark shrewd
 features

 your face means nothing to me he
 said

 think again urged the man  twas
 not in antioch lord

 i have never seen you before insisted
 matteo

 but you have persisted the merchant

 not garbed in this wise but-

 he broke off and peered at matteo
 askance with a queer contortion of his fea-
 tures that stirred a sleeping memory

 think he continued three years ago
 and more a fair day in spring like this
 a barren hillside and one who fled and men
 in armor who pursued

 in a flash the strange face became
 familiar

 the assassin who fled to the desert
 cried matteo you are kafur

 the italian merchant bowed

 kafur messer matteo i see you still
 wear the ring i gave you

 matteo twitched the heavy silver circlet
 with its impressive device

 have you come to ask it back he de-
 manded

 not so lord a gift is a gift nay i
 rode this way because one whispered in my
 ear that you were riding to massiaf and
 the way to massiaf is fraught with frequent
 dangers for those who have never ridden it
 before

 i am riding toward jebleh returned
 matteo doubtfully

 and if you will take the advice of one


adventure

who means you well you will not continue
to jebleh

 why

  because that way you can not avoid
encountering patrols of the templars who
think they guard skilfully the approaches
to my masters land

  your master

 even so the old one he whose
message i doubt not you carry in your
wallet i travel this road messer matteo
at his behest to see that you come to no
harm

  then you are to be responsible for our
safety

 aye lord ask me no more the
brotherhood of which i am a member work
in secret by devious ways you will under-
stand more before you see antioch again
but first answer me this proposed
matteo why does sinan wish me to come
to massiaf

   twould be death to answer said
kafur quickly wait and you shall hear
it from his lips

 but-

  lord i know not i might not tell you
if i would

  there is none to overhear you

  the assassin looked around him with
a shudder of apprehension

  sinan hears everything he answered
in the midst of the desert you could not
talk unheard

  a lord of vast powers commented
matteo with sarcasm

  far vaster than you reckon

  yet he fears the templars beyond all
bounds

  aye because if he slays one grand mas-
ter they elcct another and to celebrate it
destroy one of his out-lying borderholds
an hours ride to the south they came to
a point where the road forked one arm
turning westward to the coast the other
following a line of hills overlooking the
valley of the oront es

  had you followed the coast road messer
matteo said the assassin pointing to the
west you would have been caught by the
templars this other path climbs to
massiaf by passes the templars have never
been able to enter

  that night they slept in a peasants hut
the next day they traversed a wild and
desolate country which became ruggedly
mountainous as they pressed on once

kafur left the path for a rocky ravine to
avoid a troop of spears they saw issuing from
a small castle overhanging the cliffs ahead

  but they are christians objected
matteo why should we fear them
because you are not in christian com-
pany replied kafur with a gleam of teeth

  the second night they encamped by
a mountain-stream without a fire and the
wolves howled around them until dawn
they had not been long on their way in the
morning when they heard cries from a near-
by hillside and a body of mountaineers in
goatskin garments raced toward them with
bow-strings taut

  shall we charge or fly asked matteo
as he and ali drew their swords

  for your lives do neither returned
kafur they are my people the watch-
ers of the passes

  as the mountaineers approached he took
from one of his packs a replica of the gro-
tesque triple-bladed knife which was carved
on matteos ring he held it high above his
head and the watchers stopped in their
tracks

  the sign of death they cried pass
friends of the old one

  three times afterward they were assailed
by savage bands at different points in the
passes twice on the distant horizon
matteo beheld the towers of fortalices
whose strength seemed to lie rather in un-
assailable locations than in size but not
once did they see a house or a hovel or any
indication of human occupancy not even
animals or cultivated fields

  how do your people live questioned
matteo in bewilderment

  that is our secret said kafur with his
ready smile they do not lack for any-
thing they are so happy that they weep
when they must go away

  go away

  obey the orders of the old one he
explained

  and what are his orders

  nay messer matteo you ask too many
questions perchance you shall learn from
the old one himself if he chooses
matteo was about to answer in pique
when the assassin seized him by the arm
see he said there is massiaf
they were on the crest of the pass and
leagues away across the mountains loomed
a soaring pile of towers battlements and
pinnacles limned against the blue of the
a son of strife



horizon line like some fairy stronghold that
would vanish at the waving of a wand

  is it far asked matteo moved de-
spite himself by the glamour of the picture

   another days ride rejoined kafur and
he added enigmatically few have been
anxious to reach it and fewer still have
been ready to leave it when the hour came

chapter xiv

the garden of delight

the towers of massiaf faded into the
twilight as they descended the oppo-
site side of the pass it was not until the
afternoon of the next day that they saw it
again sitting so serenely in the sky almost
as if it belonged to another world

  drawing nearer hour by hour matteo
realized that it was much larger than he had
at first supposed wall and turret bartizan
and bailey the structure soared above the
mountain peak it crowned not one but
a succession of superimposed fortifications
like a town rather than a castle

  the country at its foot was as bleak and
inhospitable as any they had crossed in
their journey black rocks and stunted trees
and no crops growing in the few patches of
earth that lay in folds of the cliffs no man
appeared to watch them pass no curious
eyes looked down from the battlements as
they reached the deep dry moat that
yawned before the lower wall a short dist-
ance up the mountains flank

    tis like a castle of the jinn muttered
ali crossing himself

  your christianity is but skin deep
jeered matteo himself none too comfort-
able there are no such things as jinn

  mayhap but here is evil or i never saw
wickedness tis not human mark the
size of the hold-and never a human to be
seen who but satan could rule in such
a place

  our guide is not concerned said mat-
teo pointing to kafur who rode phleg-
matically in front of them

   aye for he is satans familiar i begin
to think messer matteo

  the saints forbid but see they lower
the draw

  without a hail from kafur without a
trumpet-blast or challenge from the bare
walls the ponderous mass of the draw-
bridge began to drop across the moat ahead

of them it settled into place with a flick of
dust and kafur turned in his saddle and
beckoned matteo and ali to follow him
as their horses hoofs rang on the planks
matteo craned his head upward expecting
to surprize some sly watcher at loophole or
machicoulation but there was not a sign
of human occupancy the walls and towers
stretched around the mountainside white
and vacant beneath the lowering sun

  he peered forward under the shadows of
the arch of the gateway there too was
emptiness no guards awaited them no
sentries appeared their horses hoofs rum-
bled in the archway behind them there
was a clang and matteo looked back hastily
to see the portcullis dropped in place the
draw itself commenced to rise again
noiselessly without a hint of machinery or
human hands he shuddered a fear akin
to that which ali had expressed stole over
him this place was eery uncanny he
forced himself to address a remark to kafur
as they emerged from the gateway arch into
a stone-paved courtyard

  your lord is not dowered with many
servants it seems

  nay his servants are many but dis-
creet

  will they condescend to take our
horses inquired matteo sarcastically

  in time we have yet some distance to
ride

  they passed through a gateway in the
opposite wall of the courtyard which stood
open and found themselves upon a zigzag-
ging ramp of stone barred at intervals by
gates and lined with loopholed walls which
climbed the mountainside toward the en-
chanted pile of the castle proper the
defenses they had so far seen were only
outworks

   up and up they toiled their horses plod-
ding steadily on the cobbled way no
sound of voices no clashing of weapons no
smell of cooking reached them they
might have been in the land of the dead
for all the visible evidence of life that was
afforded them the clicking of hoofs and
the creaking of saddles echoed prodigiously
between the long white walls that lined the
ramp occasionally they came to a window
in the walls through which they might view
the wild tangle of mountains they had
passed no less desolate than this castle of
emptiness

  yet matteo fancied that unseen eyes
io

adventure

were watching him he had a sensation as
if all about him sentient life was teeming
held in check by some master will he felt
as though any moment a thousand voices
might shriek a savage war-cry and he knew
that if they did his straining nerves must
break

  but nothing happened instead they
came into a second courtyard immediately
below the wide-ranging cluster of towers
which capped the peak from doorways
in its walls stepped immense negro slaves
clad in spotless white waist-cloths who
helped them to dismount and then led the
horses away all without a single word or
even unnecessary gesture

  if it please you messer matteo follow
me said kafur

  it matters not whether it pleases me
retorted matteo the bird in the trap
must do as the trapper lists

  kafur stopped before an iron gate in the
wall one hand raised to strike a pendant
gong beside it

  nay you are free he said but say
the word and i will summon back your
horses and you may depart

  matteo hesitated half of a mind to put
the statement to the test

sinan hath no use for those who fear
aught added kafur impartially if you
would go you had best go before tis too late
who said that i fear demanded
matteo with heat

  he strode to the gate and smote the
gong with his sword-hilt the gate swung
open by a chain which ran through a hole
in the stonework

  lead on he said and remember
whoever you are i fear nothing that the
hand can touch or the eye see

  kafur salaamed with a twinkle of mirth
in his eye

  your pardon lord your servants
words were ill chosen none the less tis
true that you are still at liberty to go back
if you wish tis for you to choose

  i have chosen

  so be it

  he led them through a long tunnel into
a third courtyard which was planted with
trees and shrubs embellished with tinkling
fountains and rare mosaics of stone and
statues deftly carven which matteo knew
must have been the handiwork of the an-
cient artisans of the east

  in the arcade which formed a quadrangle

about the court he halted and clapped his
hands twice three blacks ran forward
from some unseen entrance and stood be-
fore them with heads bowed and arms
crossed on their breasts

  you will require rest and refreshment
messer matteo said kafur these are
your slaves they will bring you whatever
you wish

  i thought i came hither to see sinan
objected matteo

  so you did lord but you are weary
nay i am as ready now as i shall be
later insisted matteo

  sinan will be glad to hear of your zeal
replied kafur smoothly evasive there
is time for you to rest and eat

  with that he turned upon his heel and
vanished giving matteo no time for further
objections one of the negroes lifted
matteos hand to his forehead and mo-
tioned to the far side of the quadrangle

  there is naught for it but to go whither
we are led quoth matteo resignedly for
good or ill we are her and must do as we
are bid ali

  aye messer matteo and keep our
swords handy returned the old turcople
craftily at the least these blacks are
humans which is proof the place hath other
than jinn to garrison it

  the negroes conducted them up a narrow
stair in the wall to a chamber both large and
high with windows overlooking the court
adjoining it was a bath and laying aside
their armor and soiled garments matteo
and ali enjoyed a plunge in the cool waters
which flowed in and out of vents in the
marble walls

  whoever he may be this sinan must
possess as much wealth as prince bohe-
mond suggested ali as they dried them-
selves and one of the negroes draped them
in flowing robes of silken materials

  and magic gardens too it would seem
remarked matteo stepping into their cham-
ber where the other two slaves were arrang-
ing a low table set with a wealth of fruits
and meats with flasks and flagons of wine
in buckets of snow

  whence comes this profusion he asked
in the saracen tongue

  the blacks smiled to show they under-
stood and opened their mouths pointing
at the mutilated stumps of their tongues

  mutes exclaimed ali  tis no won-
der the place is so quiet
a son of strife



  they sat on cushions by the table and
the blacks served them swiftly with all that
they wished as evening drew on bronze
lamps were lighted once matteo walked
to the windows and looked out the court-
yard was dark not a sound drifted up to
him but the pattering of the fountain

  after that he had no desire to move
a drowsy feeling stole over him the wine
was heady and sweet the slaves kept his
cup always full still he thought it was
strange that he should yield to its effects so
early he who was accustomed to the
carouses of bohemonds court

  ali he said with an effort doth the
wine ring in your head

  ali who had been silent since his second
cup quaffed a flagon with the practised
ease of an old campaigner

 nay lord tis not the wine he an-
wered thickly

  what then

   tis hashish messer matteo aye
hashish sinans folk have their name of
assassins from hashish they-use-the-
drug-

 how what-say-you demanded
matteo as his followers reply trailed off
into nothingness

  hashish - hashishans - assassins
muttered the turcople

  matteo struggled to rise to his feet to
walk around the table but he seemed to
have leaden weights binding him down
and while his head did not hurt it was
heavy he was conscious that it kept fall-
ing forward on his chest

  ali he called again

  there was no answer

  treachery murmured matteo to him-
self kill-knaves

  he started to crawl on his hands and
knees to the divan where he had left his
sword but as he leaned forward his head
dropped and he could not raise it again
he was vaguely aware of being lifted by the
blacks and carried to this very divan as he
sank into the cushions he stretched his hand
out for the sword-hilt-and a great darkness
blanketed his mind a darkness that was
animate in its luxurious denseness in the
delicious languor it inspired

  in that first moment of his awaking mat-
teo lay with his eyes half-closed drinking
in the fragrance of the perfumes that drifted
on the air and the subdued melodies almost
as intangible as the odors of the flowers

which were wafted to his ears it was good
to lie inert effortless betwixt the worlds
as it were and take joy in the pleasantness
of his surroundings but after a while
a sense of uneasiness possessed him there
was something he did not understand in his
position that soft music was subtly dis-
turbing in its low insistent play of passion
that-

  he heard a movement near him and

suddenly sat up

   ali he called

  ali did not answer and matteo searched
the room with dazed perplexed eyes yes
there was ali reposing on a couch like his
own a kind of cushioned litter but the
room was not that in which they had
feasted the night before it was more
open sunlight poured in on three sides

  what does my lord wish asked a gen-
tle voice behind him you have only to
name it

  matteo swung his feet to the marble floor
and looked around a girl in a costume of
shimmering transparent stuffs girdled with
a belt of golden disks stood smiling down
upon him she was dark with long sheeny
black hair and tawny brown eyes and the
rich tints of her rounded limbs gleamed
through her draperies

  who are you he said dumbly

  your slave

  where am i

  in paradise lord

  in paradise he shook his head slowly
nay maiden tell me in sooth where

am i

  said i not in paradise lord but if you
like another name better why not call it the
garden of delight

  matteo regarded her blankly she was
very fair and her surroundings were of
appropriate cast

  last night i entered the castle of sinan
lord of the assassins he said slowly we
feasted-and slept

  and today you are in paradise lord
she replied brightly are you not fortu-
nate among men

  i do not know he said

  she came close to him

  are you not pleased with me lord she
asked frankly

  pleased

  aye lord i should like to please you
but if i do not mayhap some one of my
sisters shall be more fortunate
adventure

  she started to clap her hands

  nay said matteo quickly i meant
no discourtesy maiden but my follower-
why does he not awake

  he shall she promised and slipping
across the chamber blew lightly upon alis
eyes

  the old turcople yawned heavily ex-
tended his sinewy frame rolled from side to
side opened his eyes-and sat up

  what-what- he gasped

  aye what returned matteo grimly
speaking in the frankish tongue

  will my lord take food interposed the
girl

  yes said matteo glad of the oppor-
tunity to be rid of her

  she made a salaam embraced him and
ali in a dazzling smile and left the room

  where are we messer matteo in-
quired the turcople trying his feet to the
floor to make sure it was real

  you are in paradise ali according to
my fair informant who it seems is one of
the houris

  it can not be denied ali practically
we are christians lord paradise is not
for us

  the girl who had awakened them re-
appeared at this moment ushering in a pro-
cession of other damsels all as fair as er-
self all draped in the sheer fabrics which
only masked their dainty figures they
carried a number of trays of food and each
smiled whole-heartedly upon the two men

  your slaves are delighted to serve you
said the girl who had first appeared

  ali stared until his eyes almost popped
out of his head

  if this be paradise lord we are in it by
mistake he spluttered

  it may be heaven suggested matteo
amusedly

  nay nay lord heaven is not like this
this is allahs paradise and if allah finds
us here he will call in a pair of afrits and
bid them carry us down to eblis which is
hell and verv much like the christians
hell i think

  what does the old man say asked the
leader of the damsels

  he says that we are christians and have
no place in allahs paradise replied mat-
teo with a smile he thinks that we shall
be carried down to eblis by the afrits

  the girl and her companions broke into
pearly bursts of laughter

  it is true we have seldom had christians
in the garden said the one who had
attached herself to matteo but upon
occasion allah sees fit to honor some and
we who are his houris and the slaves of all
true believers who are favored of allah do
what we may to make their stays agreeable
to them

  their stays repeated matteo once
arrived in paradise do the favored ever
depart

  she arranged the trays before him and
caressed his shoulder with a hand like
a rose bloom

  you ask too many questions lord she
smiled eat and prithee be merry

  so being hungered he ate as did ali and
the damsels attended them quick to antici-
pate their wants

  what else do vve do besides eat and
drink in paradise queried matteo at last

  whatsoever you will lord

  matteo looked whimsically at ali

  let us inspect paradise what say vou
ali

  aye messer matteo the turcople
agreed readily

  the damsels clustered about them with
willowy grace

  do you come with us lord directed
the leader your domain lies ready for
you

  she took his hand in hers and the othwrs
danced ahead as she guided him out upon
a portico in front of the chamber in which
they had awakened ali followed rubbing
his eyes very hard

chapter xv

             

temptation

matteo caught his breath at the ex-
otic beauty of the scene

  certes tis paradise stammered ali

  they stood in an open courtyard sunk
below the level of the surrounding ground
it was embowered in flowers gorgeous
roses blossomed in every open space vines
and creepers covered the walls and stone-
work with a net of luscious greenery ferns
and dwarf cypresses gnarled olive trees
broad patches of lotus blooms a score of
colorful plants matteo could not name
crowded the perspective of the garden

  at the far end a silvery cascade foamed
its way down a series of troughs in the
a son of strife



midst of a flight of marble stairs and
dropped in one last ecstatic leap into a long
pool which ran through the center of the
courtyard to their feet beyond the steps
a broad expanse of greensward dotted with
forest trees stretched to the lichen-covered
cliffs which blocked the vista

  behind the house from which they had
emerged were other gardens like the one
before them set with pavilions of similar
architecture in the arabian style roofs
swelling into bulbous domes tiled with a
myriad contrasting hues latticed windows
to shut out the sun-glare arched bal-
conies and porches at intervals fountains
threw their spray high in air between the
buildings thick clumps of jade-green cy-
presses towered aloft and in the background
the valley was sealed by a tremendous wall
which reared its granite courses more than
a hundred feet above their heads without a
single opening

  the sides of the valley matteo perceived
sloped gradually for a short distance and
then ascended perpendicularly in cliffs
which seemed to furnish architraves for the
fleecy clouds that floated over them the
air was balmy with the odor of flowers the
delicate music which had stirred matteos
senses upon awaking pulsed in their ears
song birds linked the strains with the har-
monies of nature the splashing of the foun-
tains and the tinkling of the cascades
throbbed through the medley of sound and
color

  if this be not paradise then paradise
can not be more fair he said gravely
damsel how came we to this place

  she smote him lightly across the mouth
with the petals of her fingers

  said i not you asked too many ques-
tions lord she chided merry-eyed in
the garden of delight which is paradise for
ordinary mortals if not for frankish jon-
gleurs we do not ask or answer questions
what do you then

  we live-and play-and dance-and
love

  but your pursuits do not interest me at
this moment objected matteo i came
hither on an errand of vengeance

  she surveyed him archly

  you are full young to be so stern lord
and the old one with you

  i am as you say an old one rejoined
ali maakwaa sturdily for the rest i
think as my master does

  nay we shall make trial of you she
said

  before matteo could answer she glided
from his side with a wave of command to
her attendants the unseen music shifted
to a livelier theme and the houris whirled
into the measures of a posturing dance
muslin draperies clung and fell loose with
the energy of movement unshod feet
seemed to spurn the velvet grass weaving
arms and wind-borne tresses were a diadem
of ivory and ebony

  the music quickened faster and faster
spun the dancers backward and forward
forward and back they floated about the
two men now close now in swift retreat
a lock of scented hair whipped matteos
cheek white arms invited him the music
rose to a crescendo the dancers worked
themselves to a pitch of frenzy-a cloud of
tumultuous draperies a confusion of gleam-
ing limbs pouting lips and refulgent eyes

  snap the music ended the dancers
poised in air fell forward on their faces all
save the leader she wavered forward like
a weary bubble of foam and collapsed
against matteo her body slipping through
his reluctant arms until he was obliged to
clasp her to him she tossed back the
torrent of her hair and looked up at him
with her head upon his shoulder

  how now lord she murmured is
this a place for asking questions

  he bent to meet her lips her tawny
eyes smiled into his dewy and emotional

  i know not he said you are very
fair

  he felt himself sinking into the pools of
her eyes

  i am yourslord

  houri or not you are-

  his arms tightened about her convul-
sively so that she cried out in the mirror
of her iris rimmed by the opalescent whites
fringed by long black lashes he seemed to
see reflected the picture of a lissom maiden
with red-gold hair astride a racing black
horse the picture framed itself and van-
ished in the blinking of an eyelid

  he gasped and his arms released her
she floated from him puzzled a rebellious
frown on her face

  i do not find favor in my lords sight
she said sullenly

  he stared at her uncomprehending

  i may not he answered slowly
your pleasures are not for me lady
no

adventure

  the half-circle of dancers leaped lithely
to their feet rearranging their filmy rai-
ment eying matteo and their leader with
ill-concealed wonder

  how say you messer matteo spoke up

ali they seem to fancy us shall we--

  matteo turned upon him

  i know not what this means he said
using the frank tongue but do not
respond to their advances this is no
more paradise than it is antioch tis
some hellish plot of sinans

  what

  the turcoples mouth gaped wide
last night pursued matteo swiftly
did you not tell me you suspected we had
been fed with hashish

  so i did messer matteo i had for-
gotten

  by the saints that explains it all we
have been drugged and carried to some
pleasure garden of sinans to be cozened
into readiness to submit ourselves to his
will

  mayhap but touching what the damsel

said about paradise-

  take thought to your wits ali as you
said in the beginning how could two pro-
fessing christians gain entrance to allahs
paradise and did you ever hear priest
describe heaven like to this

  nay admitted the turcople unwilling-
ly yet i see not why sinan should in-
dulge us with his harem which i take it you
suppose this to be

  i suppose nothing i do not know
matteo turned upon the leader of the
houris

  damsel he said i would not have
you think me unkind but i am in no mood
for dalliance i would ask no fairer lady
than yourself to idle away the hours
but--

  she laughed sweetly as a chiming bell
certes fair lord you are the first to
enter the garden of delight who refused its
courtesies but this day is young and
others will follow and you will soon see the
writing of kismet on the wall do not
forget me you are different from other
men and i could love well one who is not
too easily tempted

  but if this is paradise i shall be here
always and will you not serve me alone
asked matteo smiling

  yours i shall be and yours alone if you
desire it so long as allah wills

 then i may be cast forth from
 paradise

 she laughed and all her attendants joined
 with her in the echoing peal

 here may return all who desire and who
 will pay the price she replied

 what price

 i know not

 would you serve me he tried her
 gladly lord

 she leaned toward him eagerly

 i have business in massiaf how may
 i go thence

 disappointment clouded her face

 here we have naught to do with
 massiaf

 but how may i go there at least tell
 me that

 nay she returned none may leave
 the garden-without permission

 whose permission

 his-allahs kismets name him as
 you please

 but who will prevent our departure
 the guardians

 who are they

 see for yourself lord

 and she waved a slim arm toward the
 huge wall of masonry that blocked the exit
 from the valley

 zounds i will exclaimed matteo
 come ali

 is there to be a fight inquired ali
 interestedly

 we have no weapons still-

 the houris joined in mocking laughter
 there will be no fight said the leader
 go and look upon the guardians when
 you return we shall be awaiting you per-
 chance we may find other means of diverting
 you we who have not been so fortunate as to
 win your approval

 they danced away around the opposite
 side of the pavilion gauzy tunics eddying
 in the mild breeze raven locks cloaking their
 loveliness voices chanting an elfin snatch of
 song

 messer matteo said the old turcople
 quite seriously why should we go to talk
 with these guardians or seek to leave this
 place before we must i have been a man-
 at-arms all my life and certes i never saw
 a fairer house or more beautiful women
 let us bide here and take pleasure as we
 may

 and bow to sinans will amended
 matteo you are seasoned in war and
a son of strife

hi

you know tis folly to do that which your
opponent wishes you to do sinan is now
in some sort our enemy he hath put us
here for reasons of his own to begin with
he hath sent for me when i come to
massiaf instead of seeing me he drugs me
and hath me removed hither why i
say again ali it can be only because he
aims to make of me-and you-his tool
ali shrugged his shoulders unconvinced
you are my lord messer matteo

what you say i will do yet-

  he sighed lugubriously and his eyes
strayed to the clump of cypresses which
had swallowed the dancing girls

  matteo set off along a pebbly path which
threaded the garden or series of gardens
on the iloor of the valley the turcople
followed him with heavy feet and wander-
ing gaze but no other houris appeared to
distract their attention they passed sev-
eral of the pavilions and sometimes a faint
lilt of laughter or the echo of music reached
their ears but the dwellers in these pleasure
houses remained concealed from sight

  the path ended in a dense growth of
cypresses and after a moments search
matteo discovered that it bore to the left
and continued past the trees turning a
corner he found himself at the base of the
granite wall that sealed the valleys en-
trance in front of him yawned a semi-
circular opening closed by a network of
steel bars and on either side of this stood a
gigantic negro in white waist-cloth and tur-
ban with an immensely long simitar in the
hollow of his arm

  ali took one look at their wizened faces
incongruously out of place with their pow-
erful bodies

  eunuchs he muttered careful
lord these cattle are not to be toyed with
matteo strode up to the nearest of the
guards

  i would fain go up to massiaf he said
the man exposed his white teeth in a
grin but made no other answer

  open for me bade matteo do you
understand

  the man opened his mouth and stooped
to permit matteo to see the stump that had
been left of his tongue

  naught but houris and eunuch mutes
remarked ali with satisfaction this
valley is tetter than many castles i have
known you had best reflect again mes-
ser matteo

  be still commanded matteo impa-
tiently

  he tapped the guard on the arm and
pointed to the gateway

  open he repeated

  the eunuchs reply was to thumb the
blade of his simitar and emit a shrill
whistle feet pattered behind the bars
and dimly matteo descried a dozen or
more fellows to the two on his side of the
grill whose teeth and simitars glittered in
the shadows the man matteo had
touched grinned and shook his head

  had we our svvords i would assail the
dogs declared matteo furiously but
tis of no avail ali we shall gain naught
by this parade of our helplessness

  so i believed from the beginning messer
matteo agreed the old turcople cheer-
fully we were much better off with the
houris that allah or somebody sent us by
mistake mayhap

  never by mistake be sure of that
and let me not catch you yielding to
their amorous persuasions or when i re-
gain my freedom i will cast you from my
service

  no need of hard words lord grumbled
ali when did i deny your orders since
you were old enough to hold a blade
certes if you will be a fool ali maakwaa
will suffer with you

  the cypresses were between them and the
guarded gate and matteo dropped his arm
about the turcoples shoulders

  tis as you say he returned there
is no need for hard words we will face this
together and if you will but stand by me
we shall yet have sinan at a loss

  oh ill stand by you promised ali
never doubt ha here are the houris
again

  matteo smiled at the comical note of
infatuation which instantly showed in his
followers voice

  remember he warned on guard
the damsels are our enemies they would
conquer our souls so that sinan may en-
slave our wills

  the houris danced around them with a
flaunting of delicate charms and a deluge of
bantering remarks

  certes now you know you may not flee
from our ugliness you will no longer leave
us to pine alone cried their leader

  we are resolved since we must lady to
get on as best we can replied matteo


adventure

  you have but to order lord she an-
swered readily shall we dance once more
for you shall we sing to you or shall
we wander through the garden

  not so returned matteo warily it
hath reached your ears i believe that i am
a singer of songs and a teller of tales

  aye lord

  then my suggestion is that we repair to
the pavilion in which you found us and
make an exchange of the songs and ro-
maunts we know

  the damsels all clapped their hands de-
lightedly

  a fair proposal they applauded
come let us dance thither

  and the merry crew skipped along over
the short springy grass singing as they
went a persian love song that was gemmed
with classical naughtiness

  in the pavilion a bountiful assortment of
baked fowls and meats tender salads
sweets and fruits and half a dozen different
wines awaited them the damsels insisted
first upon serving matteo and ali after-
ward all sat on the cushions ranged around
the low table and when the edge of hunger
had been dulled and the wine-cups had
been filled the leader of the houris requested
matteo to render them a song after the
manner of the franks then she sang in
reply to him and one of her company told
a tale that was spiced with wickedness and
packed with laughable puns and matteo
recited the geste of hwesgither which
told how a danish knight had loved a
french lady better than life or his own
desires

  so passed the day until evening had be-
come night

  have we met your approval lord
asked the queen of the houris when the ap-
plause of matteos effort had died away
aye indeed

  and doth it please you to accept the love
we offer you

  nay lady quoth matteo as per-
chance you may have perceived my people
do not look upon love as do yours for us
the end of love doth not consist in the mere
attainment of its fruits we look beyond
to the satisfaction and enrichment of the
soul tis what we call chivalry

  and you may love no woman she
asked wide eyed

  nay lady i worship one who is far
beyond me far above me a fair star set in

the ultimate skies to her service i am
sworn from this day forth

 his questioner sighed

 bear witness comrades she appealed
 to her attendants i have striven with all
 my arts

 aye so have you sister they replied

 she turned again to matteo

 tis a barren creed you own sweet
 youth she said i could wish you might
 choose ours life is life and the pleasure
 of it is fleeting why stray after what may
 be no more than a mirage of the desert
 you are there and i can feel you-so
 she clasped his hand in hers that is
 real but can you touch this specter of
 the skies

 she is as real to me as if i could an-
 swered matteo simply

 ha so you are a stout lover of your
 own kind yet i have one boon to ask of
 you

 name it lady

 she took a tall flask of wine which had not
 been opened and poured a cup this she
 lifted and kissed the rim

 drink lord she cried thus you may
 not forget one who was unworthy

 not unworthy objected matteo

 he drank and she refilled the cup and
 passed it to ali

 you too old one she said

 ali drained it nothing loath and of a
 sudden it seemed to matteo that her face
 was dwindling into the background of
 shadows a weight as of all the world
 bore down upon him

 what follows he mumbled thickly

 he was conscious of soft arms that stole
 around his neck of lips pressed to his of
 the intoxicating perfume of her body

 you bid farewell to paradise a voice
 murmured from a vasty distance

chapter xvi

the lord of death

messer matteo messer matteo
matteo aroused himself resent-
fully somebody was shaking him by the
shoulders

 wake up messer matteo we are out
 of paradise

 matteo sat up and looked around him
 ali had just released him they were in
 the room overlooking the courtyard in
a son of strife



massiaf to which they had been conducted
upon their arrival

  how came we here he asked stupidly
nay lord i have been awake only long
enough to come to your side

  tis more of sinans deviltry decided
matteo discarding the silken robe he
wore finding he might not seduce us
in that garden of delight which so attracted
you ali he hath removed us to earthly
quarters

  aye there is a flavor of hashish on my
tongue admitted ali sheepishly be-
think you messer matteo was it all a
dream

  a dream never and do not let
them delude you into fancying twas so
come now let us bathe

  they found their clothes arrayed in
order and their weapons and armor bright
ali was buckling his masters sword-belt
when a knock sounded at the doorway and
kafur entered with two of the negro slaves
carrying trays of food

  greeting lord he hailed matteo
did you rest well

  we rested passing well and enjoyed
diverting dreams replied matteo

  that is fortunate said kafur imper-
turbably for sinan desires your presence
as soon as you shall have broken your fast
he hath taken his time in receiving
us retorted matteo exploring the tray
before him

  why you must have had sleep--
  for a day and two nights

  kafur eyed the jongleur shrewdly but
made no answer so matteo and ali ate
their fill and then rose to signify their
readiness to wait upon the lord of massiaf

  their guide led them into a section of the
castle which they had not traversed pre-
viously guards in shining mail with
simitars unsheathed stood along the walls
of passages and at every door and gateway
they climbed interminable flights of stairs
and emerged at last upon a broad terrace on
the edge of a great cliff which formed one
face of the mountain

  the terrace was thronged with men in
white robes and turbans and at the right
side a throne was erected upon a stone plat-
form on this throne was huddled a small
figure shrouded in ample robes all of it
that could be seen was the head abnor-
mally large with skin stretched tight over
prominent bones long woolly white hair

and beard thin hawklike nose and eyes that
burned with lambent flames

  not a word was said kafur walked to
the foot of the throne knelt and thrice
bowed his forehead to the pavement
matteo and ali stood behind him restless
under the piercing eyes

  rise slave croaked the owner of the
eyes with an impatient gesture of clawlike
fingers is this the frank i bade you
fetch

   aye lord

  the eyes concentrated upon matteo
  do you know me rasped the voice

   i think you are he who is called sinan
returned matteo coolly the lord of the
assassins

  also called the old man of the moun-
tain chuckled the voice shrilly also
called the lord of death

  it may be lord agreed matteo you
sent for me whatwould you have

   the eyes on the throne glared into his
wot you of my power frank asked
the voice

  i know that you are feared

  again the harsh grating chuckle in-
human in its heartless glee

   here slave the voice that followed it
abruptly was vibrant with authority

  a finger beckoned one of the white-clad
figures from the front rank about the throne
the man stepped forward a stalwart
handsome fellow

  the cliff-edge-jump ordered the
voice

  the man salaamed once his face never
twitched he walked to the cliff-edge and
stepped off into space not a sound em-
phasized the act not a voice was raised
in applause or denunciation sinan
watched the obedience of his order with a
ferocious kind of interest then fastened his
attention again upon matteo who could
not repress a shudder

  have your frankish rulers such serv-
ants demanded the voice

  no lord they value their servants
lives too much

lives what are lives here you
the terrible old man on the throne
beckoned at random to a retainer near-by
and the man designated advanced without
a tremor

  cut off your head bade the voice

  the man salaamed whipped his simitar
from its sheath placed the keen edge to his
h

adventure

throat shoved with desperate energy-
and his head flew from the neck and rolled
trickling blood to the steps of the throne
while the body spouting like a fountain
collapsed slowly to the ground

  hee hee hee giggled the voice on the
throne that mans father died for me
and his grandfather slew himself in the
same way for my father have you
franks families of servants like them
nay lord answered matteo and i
pray you give me no more demonstrations
of your power once was enough tis
against my religion for men to slay them-
selves without cause

  religion what is religion and as
for cause-did not their lord command
them

  it may be returned matteo steadily
but i take no joy in slaughter now
what is your will with me

  sinan regarded him for several moments
with blazing eyes

  you realize my power he questioned
  aye lord

  if i ordered your death naught could
save you

  yet i do not fear you

  ha so you are a brave youth i
have watched you long did you know
that

  nay lord

  sinan chuckled to himself

  three years i have watched you since
you made use of that ring you still wear
upon messer gambaglio in tripoli aye
messer matteo i have watched your
progress with interest

  you flatter me lord

  not so i would use you

  it may be we shall not agree said
matteo

  behind him ali whispered tremblingly
  speak him fair messer matteo for

-sake speak him fair

  sinan chuckled with fiendish glee

  not agree tee hee hee tis a
brave youth life is not promising for
those who do not agree with the lord of
death

  as you please retorted matteo re-
member the temptations of paradise did
not tempt

  the miniature figure on the marble
throne writhed itself into a knot on the
cushions

  paradise it snarled what talk is

this those who despise paradise have left
to them only eblis

  now matteo had not forgotten the inex-
pressible sneer with which sinan had dis-
missed his mention of religion he aimed
a shot at random

  for the ignorant tis well enough to talk
of paradise and eblis lord but we know
how to balance life and the future and what
is hidden behind the veil

  the wrathful figure uncoiled itself with a
kind of malign interest such as it had ex-
hibited once before

  tis a rare youth observed the spite-
ful voice kafur the brethren will re-
tire i will talk with messer matteo
alone

  the host of white-garbed men salaamed
deeply and backed off through the one
wide gateway which gave on the terrace
kafur was last of all his inscrutable face
revealing nothing of his thoughts

  sinan waited the dispersal of his followers
with ill-concealed impatience

  come closer youth he said eagerly
when all were out of earshot nay not
you old monkey this last was ejaculated
at ali who would have followed his master
you have a keen wit you should know
better than to cast doubt upon the bene-
fits of paradise before my people mayhap
you would not poison any of them but one
can never be sure

  matteo smiled

  you knew you had not deluded me did
you not lord

  aye but men have gone in and doubted
and when they came forth they cried like
babes to be sent back the hellish
chuckle burst out again with cynical mirth
such are glad to slay themselves at a nod
for by death at the wish of their lord they
believe that they shall win the right of
entry into paradise never to depart

  matteo experienced a shock of revulsion

  so that is how you school your follow-
ers to such explicit obedience he ex-
claimed

  the credit is not mine returned sinan
complacently i am the third lord of
the order in syria but long years ago it was
established at alamut in the caucasus by
hassan the persian who was first to per-
ceive the surest way to attach mens
loyalty

  and none hath denounced the im-
posture
a son of strife

ii

  of what avail for any to do so i have
but to send the doubter to the garden of
delight no moslem can withstand the
lure

  a christian can said matteo proudly
so it seems agreed sinan for a
day he added giggling

   for as long as it pleases himrejoined
matteo think not lord because you
have the power of life and death that you
can bend me to your will at worst you
can slay me

  why that is true approved sinan
i had it in mind to tty you out for i
would bind you to me if i could the
shrill voice took on a note of earnestness
matteo had not noted before aye could
i have won you to me by the garden of de-
light i had held you youth in chains more
rigid than any christian dungeon boasts
but you withstood me-how i know not
say was it art-magic religion means
naught to me all religion is wordy
nothingness but betimes i think there is
a germ of truth in the black art what was
your spell

  love answered matteo smiling
love the principle of likeness
the carrion head on the throne wagged
knowingly i have heard the necroman-
cers advance the theory we will argue it
some other time the morning speeds
messer matteo and we have a bargain to
drive

  i have heard naught of a bargain said
matteo

  you hear it now in brief i wish you
to slay certain persons for me

  matteo drew himself up haughtily

  my sword is not for sale

  tee hee hee you speak like some
frankish baron with castles and feudal
rights instead of a homeless bastard who
would be without any riches save what his
voice could bring him but for a certain
ring

   matteo stripped the ring from his finger
take it he said twas given me in
payment of a debt we will count the pay-
ment settled

  sinan waved it away

  you are over-hasty keep the ring
you may yet have need of it but why
should you spurn my offer

   i have heard no offer

   i offered you death

  death for whom

  those whom you hate

  the blood lashed through matteos veins
he leaned forward until his face was very
close to the evil wrinkled visage of the lord
of death

  what do you know of those i hate he
hissed

  sinan snickered with mocking hilarity

  i know everything good youth tis a
source of my power i have watched you
for three years you hate three men
achmet-ibn-muros prince of emesa el-
afdel one of his emirs and messer renier
de chappes lord of nerak and mardan

  my vengeance yes that is a price i will
accept said matteo which-

  the two saracens interrupted sinan
eagerly the time is ripe and i have
made a plan that can not fail oh long
years have i waited for such a chance
my punishment is slow but it is certain
and how all the mighty lords christian and
moslem will shudder when they see me
strike down achmet-ibn-muros in his
palace

  curiosity suddenly attacked matteo
then he remembered something his mother
had said that last night at nerak after he
had come home flushed with his day of
adventure the ring of sinan on his finger
many a prince of my house has died under
the knives of the old man of the moun-
tain

  yet he pressed the question

  why do you hate achmet-ibn-muros

  because he and his allies have waged
bitter war upon me and cut off the tribute
i used to exact from all the princes of that
country a score of times my people have
endeavored to slay him and always he
hath sent me their heads pickled in brine
but now he can not escape this plan that
i have been framing for nigh three years
leaves no path for his flight

  matteo studied the sinister figure with
growing respect at times he suspected
sinan of insanity again it seemed that
the warped twisted little body must con-
tain a genius perverted yet real

  what is your plan lord he asked

  this you are a jongleur of merit
oh do not start i have followed your
career with the interest of a father for
when gambaglio reported to me of your
visit and the circumstances of your life i
saw that you might some day be fitted to
play a part in my plots aye you are a
ii

adventure

famous jongleur and they say too that
you are as apt in saracen tales and songs as
any story-teller of damascus

  i know somewhat of such matters re-
plied matteo as sinan waited for him to
speak

  ha tis excellent mark you now
achmet-ibn-muros hath a grandson feizul-
ibn-khalid the lads father is dead he
is the apple of his grandfathers eye next
week feizul is to be married to the daughter
of the emir el-afdel tee hee hee that
touches you do you remember how he and
achmet chopped off the heads of your father
and mother oh yes i know that too
matteos throat was dry and parched
his eyes were blurred he leaned forward
and clutched sinan by the arm

  man he said harshly if you trifle with
me about this i will kill you there where
you sit-aye even though your people
hurl me over the cliff in the next breath
the lord of death met his eye without
flinching

  you are a bold youth chuckled the
knife-edged voice with its hint of spiteful
humor no man hath ever laid a finger
before this on the person of the sheikh-al-
jebal-and lived

  matteo shook him slightly unheeding his
words

  the plan he demanded the plan
a simple matter-but would you object
to unhanding me i am somewhat an-
cient and not very hardy i thank you
good youth you are rough-which augers
ill for your enemies oh yes the plan
there will be high feasting in emesa
throughout the next two weeks princes
and sultans emirs and sheikhs from all
over the land are coming you will attend
with a company of musicians dancers and
acrobats with whom your role will be
that of a story-teller you and your com-
panions will be given prompt entrance to the
palace at such a time the rest is for you
to compass

 and my company are they-

  they are such as you saw execute my
orders this morning

  but can they pass for what they pretend
to be

  damascus doth not hold more skilful
performers nay messer matteo i am
well served my spies are everywhere
my servants are of all ranks you shall
not be embarrassed by stupid helpers

  matteos hand went to his sword-hilt

  i am your man lord for this venture
when do we start

  sinan clapped his hands

  tee hee hee tis a desperate youth
but such i need such i need the sooner
the better you are the right captain for
the enterprise

  four enormous blacks entered at a trot
carrying a small open litter sinan tottered
down from his throne and sat himself in it

  come with me messer matteo and you
shall meet your assistants good men all
with a bow-string knife or pillow tee
hee hee

chapter xvii

how matteo tasted vengeance

it was evening in the court of pome-
granates  achmet-ibn-muros and his
emirs sat on carpets spread over the steps
that led up to the hall of a thousand joys
which was too cramped to receive all the
great ones who had flocked to emesa for the
marriage feast of feizul-ibn-khalid and
azra the daughter of el-afdel overhead
the women of the palace cooed behind the
gratings of the harem windows a motley
throng of retainers servants privileged
merchants of the city slaves and enter-
tainers lined the open space

  the girls of a bedouin dancing troupe
had whirled through the last mazes of their
palpitating dance and scrambled like crows
for the largesse flung by achmet and his
guests now the majordomo stepped for-
ward

  what is your pleasure prince he
asked we have a juggler with a pig-tail

from cathay or-

  nay we have had enough of the trick-
sters interrupted achmet-ibn-muros
let us hear again the young story-teller
who told the taie of sinbad and the seven
voyages

  you mean el-dimiryat of damascus
lord

  if that be his name

  the majordomo clapped his hands and
a young man clad in raiment of yellow and
green and carrying a tabor thrust himself
to the front of the bystanders after him
appeared a dozen or more stout fellows
similarly dressed who made a profound
salaam to the prince
a son of strife



  i am he for whom you asked lord said
the leader command me and i will obey
shall my comrades perform tricks of tum-
bling and strength shall they dance the
sword-dance would you have them ex-
hibit white-magic or shall they sing
medleys and glees

  not so returned the prince stroking
his long white beard it is my will that
you relate us another such tale of mystery
and courage as charmed my guests last
evening

  it shall be even as you order mighty
prince replied the young man as his fol-
lowers arranged themselves in a semicircle
behind him if it please you i shall now
proceed to narrate for your diversion the
tale of ali baba the woodcutter of ispahan
and the forty thieves

  in the name of allah the compas-
sionate the merciful praise to him the
creator of man the lord of lords the
cause of causes the one true god to
him the glory and the merit and so my
tale

  in a town in persia there lived two
brothers one named cassim the other ali
baba their father left them scarcely any-
thing but-

  utter silence possessed the court as the
golden voice exerted its spell prince and
emir merchant and soldier servant and
slave men and women all within range of
it succumbed to its charm at intervals
the narrator burst into song accompanying
himself on the tabor again his back-
ground of assistants chanted a metrical pas-
sage their sonorous tones throwing out in
high relief the rich vibrant tenor which
mastered all of them

  on drove the tale with its fantastic ele-
ments of crime and adventure love and
cunning ambition and despair which have
made it a world classic at that time even
in the country of its origin it was not so
well known as it is today achmet-ibn-
muros owned to excitement by the fre-
quency with which his lean muscular fingers
combed the thick hair of his beard

  beside him the tall hook-nosed man
whom the minstrels and entertainers knew
as the emir el-afdel father of the bride
whose nuptials they were assisting to cele-
brate stirred uneasily in his seat

  when the lids of the jars were lifted and
the thieves revealed inside a chorus of tiny
shrieks came from the womens windows

overhead and the prince and his guests
laughed with grim amusement men of
blood and death themselves they delighted
in tales of blood and death and relished a
jest all the more because it was savored with
cruelty

  by the prophet tis a pleasing tale
exclaimed the prince when the young man
salaamed in token of its finish how say
you he addressed the emir el-afdel

  the blood chills in my veins at the
ingenuity of the device returned el-afdel
why could not any enemy dispose of one
he hated by some such plan

  true assented the prince teller of
tales you have won our favor tarry a
while in emesa and when at last you leave
us your purse shall be full of gold

  you honor your servant beyond his de-
serts great prince said the young man
humbly is it permitted to offer further
entertainment

  nay for the stars say that midnight
approaches tomorrow evening you shall
entertain us again now we must hope
that the skill of your art may not affright us
with dreams of peril

  the young story-teller salaamed but
made no audible answer he and his com-
pany withdrew to one side of the courtyard
and spread their pallets under the shade of
the colonnade they were joined here by
one who came from the farther end of the
court of pomegranates a quiet shadow-
like figure low-voiced unassuming

  ha kafur breathed the young leader
you are late the graybeard hath fears
his sleep may be disturbed by dreams arising
from the crimes i recounted to him

  the quiet man smiled with deadly
mockery

  aye lord he will be disturbed dreaming
or waking all is ready

  the horses are in the grove beyond the
mosque

  aye and the brethren are assigned to
their duties four have been placed in
charge of the slaying of the outer guards
whom slay we first

  the story-tellers hand leaped instinctive-
ly to his waist-sash as he spoke kafur
considered momentarily

  it had best be el-afdel he decided
the guest-rooms will not be so closely
guarded

  i would it were the other objected the
story-teller i fear achmet-
n	adventure

   kafur laid a reassuring hand on his wrist
nay lord we cannot fail-thanks to
your achievements are we not lodging
here in the heart of the palace at the very
doors of our enemies who can stop us
a brace or two of sleepy guards to be
strangled and the ways will be open

   i hope so said the other fiercely st
matthew my namesake when i think the
graybeard may call himself my grandfather
i would open my veins and let out the blood
he hath tainted

  peace whispered kafur we must
feign sleep

  they lay down in the midst of the group
and presently all was still in the court the
servants and slaves had dispersed to the
kitchens soldiers repaired to the guard-
rooms or their posts the fountain in the
center of the court splashed lazily the
night breeze stole through the pomegranates
with a drowsy swish the palace dreamed

  hours passed but not one of the men in
the group under the colonnade was asleep
fierce eyes gleamed beneath their mantles
knives flashed ready in voluminous sleeves
they lay in close-piled inertness like watch-
ing wolves suddenly kafur emitted a gen-
tle hiss they started to their feet as a lone
figure crept from a door behind the flight
of stairs leading up to the hall of joys the
knife he held in one hand dripped redly on
the paving

   tis done he breathed as he reached
them follow brothers

  kafur and the story-tellers sped behind
him on noiseless feet the rest trailed them
close they entered the door and stumbled
over a sentry stabbed and prone the body
was shoved to one side and a member of
the band donned helmet and surcoat and
took the vacant post where the corridor
turned a second sentry lay and his mur-
derer crouched beside him

  el-afdels door is just beyond whis-
pered the assassin

  the hangings swayed in the draft as the
invaders reached the doorway three en-
tered the rest clustered in readiness to
meet whatever emergency might arise

   there he lies muttered thefirst of the
three pointing to a divan in the middle of
the chamber el-afdel was sprawled across
it arms spread wide his beaked face up-
turned

  shall i slay him asked kafur

  nay objected the story-teller with a

cruel smile ali do you take heed that
he cannot scream out then we will awaken
him he must know how he passes
there is no time to spare urged kafur
there is always time for vengeance
rejoined the story-teller

  they surrounded the divan ali placed
his dagger to the sleepers throat and
pinched his ear el-afdel opened his eyes-
and would have sat up but the naked steel
pressed him down he stared at the faces
bent over him and his eyes strained in their
sockets his face twitched with fear a
rattling noise came from his throat

  do you know me demanded the story-
teller

  yes panted el-afdel you afe the
story-teller el-dimiryat

  no snarled the story-teller that is
not really who i am i am one whose
mother you said you loved-yet you slew
her and my father too

  the spawn of the frank and her
aye do you remember how you
stormed nerak do you remember how
my father fought you in the hall and how
you feared to meet him alone and how
you hacked off his head-and hers

  the questions fell like sword-blows and
under their impact the keen face of the man
on the divan settled into rigid lines of com-
posure

  i remember

  his lips barely framed the words

  good remember now-your last
thought in life-that the son of gui de
nerak and horazahde brought you to

death

  el-afdels face twisted into a grin of
derision he filled his chest and his mouth
opened to roar a bellow that ended abruptly
in a bubbling grunt ali wiped his knife
on the divan

  there was nought else for it messer
matteo he said he would have called
the alarm he knew you would kill him
and desired the satisfaction of making sure
your death in return

  matteo looked down at the shambles of
the divan with unwilling awe

  is he really dead he asked

  no doubt of it broke in kafur
come we have another deed to do of
more import than this

  but first said matteo do you take
off his head ali we will put it with
achmets on the gates of the palace even
a son of strife



as they hung two poor skulls before the
ruins of nerak

  ali accomplished his task with neat dis-
patch and holding his bloody prize by the
hair followed the leaders back into the
corridor the other assassins were already
slinking through the passage in the direction
whence they had come they emerged
again into the court passed under the
shallow ramp of the stairs and entered a
second door which led to the princes rooms

  here too the knives of the slayers had
been busy two guards lay dead in the
-hadows and members of the band had
taken their places

  have we far to go asked matteo of
kafur do you know exactly where he
lies

  aye lord my time hath not been
wasted the while you have been charming
him into blindness he lies in the same
chamber with his beloved grandson he
cannot let the lad out of his sight and with
the marriage to be consummated tomorrow
-or so they think- a ghastly chuckle
evidenced kafurs sense of humor-he
hath kept him by his side for the night
ha by saint matthew that is a fair
act of grace exclaimed the story-teller
 twill be so much simpler

  and the bride spoke up ali where
is she

  in the womens quarters answered
kafur

  are they to be sacred to us demanded
ali

 nay but--

  let be ordered matteo impatiently
is not the blood of the men of our enemies
enough for you old wolf

  did they not slay your mother the lady
horazahde countered ali stubbornly

  mayhap but we are not saracens ali
nav i will not argue the case i do not
slav sleeping women even though i may
never wear knightly spurs

  kafur listened to this debate with cynical
indifference

  have it your own way messer matteo
he said  twould be impossible to kill
the girl without having an uproar women
willnever listen to reason and they fear
death too hardly to be quiet yet if you

say so we-

  i have said what i have said declared
matteo hastily we will slay no women
kafur shrugged his shoulders

  very well then we will finish our task
arc you ready

  the band gathered at his heels with
knives bared and he guided them along
the deserted corridor whose open doorways
gave back no echoing hails to the muffled
footfalls

  is it safe breathed matteo should

we pass bv here without securing-

  oh the- are all dead lord kafur
reassured him my people saw to that at
once we could not leave any alive on
this corridor tis not like the guest-rooms
opposite where each man hath no concern
for his neighbors affairs

  matteo shuddered he hungered for re-
venge but this bland wholesale slaughter in
the dark this stabbing of sleeping men who
died without realizing how death had smote
them was more than he could stomach

  a wide archway rose before them in
the obscure light that fell from a hanging
lamp matteo discerned two huddled shapes
upon the floor with waist-cloths knotted
around their throats beside them stood
two of the assassins

  you have heard naught questioned
kafur as the invaders approached

  there has not been the scurry of a
mouse answered one of the guardians of
the portal

  a truce to caution snarled matteo
tearing the hangings aside we have our
prey why hesitate

  the pack swarmed after him knives
clutched in their right hands waist-cloths
or unrolled turbans hung on their left arms
ready for strangling or tripping an opponent

  the chamber they entered was a large
one a shaded lamp cast subdued light
and the starshine flooded the windows
here as in el-afdels chamber a broad
divan occupied the center but on it lay
two figures instead of one matteo sped
across the intervening space and stared
down at the white-bearded head of the man
who was his grandfather to the other
sleeper he gave no heed he thought only
of achmet-ibn-muros and the fever of hate
burned fiercer in his heart

  he lifted his knife to strike and the
prince of emesa awoke with a startled
grunt ali was swift to compel silence his
knife-blade falling lightly on the scraggly
throat there was no sign of ieajr in the
old warriors face his luminous eyes
flashed with a hint of defiance


adventure

 so this is your real trade el-dimiryat
 he said

 i am not el-dimiryat returned
 matteo

 tool of sinan then

 nor am i the tool of sinan although i
 am his ally i slay you for my own satisfac-
 tion

 achmet-ibn-muros furrowed his wrinkled
 brows in thought

 i do not recall your face he answered
 how have i wronged you

 matteo leaned closer

 you wronged me grandfather when
 you murdered my father and my mother
 the haughty deep-lined face twinged mo-
 mentarily

 so they had a son murmured the
 prince and involuntarily he glanced at the
 sleeping youth beside him whose slumbers
 had not been disturbed by the pattering
 feet of the assassins or the low-toned
 dialog

 they had a son to avenge them con-
 firmed matteo

 the luminous eyes blazed with a light of
 appraisal

 a son of proper spirit approved
 achmet-ibn-muros you have the blood
 of your race

 i would i might cleanse it from my
 veins retorted matteo

 let me have that knife grandson and i
 will do it for you suggested the old man
 with a bitter smile

 nay you shall see a grandson die
 promised matteo

 he snatched the covers from the sleeping
 form next-the prince

 you would not harm him exclaimed
 achmet-ibn-muros straining against the
 knife that pressed upon his neck

 you shall see him die before your own
 head comes off exulted matteo savagely

 nay in allahs name spare him he
 is the last of my seed spare him whoever
 you are see i will suffer instead

 you will suffer as well  will wipe you
 out root and branch

 matteo grasped the shoulder of feizul-
 ibn-khalid and roughly turned him over
 on his back face upward the youths
 eyes blinked open and he sat up with a
 yawn

what-who-

 but his amazement was not greater than
 matteos for the face before matteo was

 the face of horazahde the face of his
 mother

  dear lord gasped matteo what is
this

  he covered his own eyes and sank down
 upon the couch how could he slay this
 boy younger than himself this boy who
 whatever his name had the face of his
 mother the great dark eyes the contours
 the delicate eyebrows and ears

  i can not i can not he groaned aloud

chapter xviii

the gift of feizul-ibn-kiialio

fje is no more than a girl-faced boy
      grunted ali in disgust

  have you looked closely at him re-
turned matteo uncovering his own eyes

  nay but-ha tis-oh holy mary
oh blessed lord

  ali staggered back as though he too
had seen a ghost

  if i was not sure i would think she-
 he muttered brokenly nay but el-afdel
 smote off her head

  you babble like a child old wolf said
 matteo scornfully  tis the bridegroom
 but his blood is my blood the blood of her
 who-

  the young feizul who had stared from
one to the other of them in bewilderment
appealed for enlightenment

  who are these people grandfather
how came they here

  the youth is your cousin i know not
his name

  i am matteo dantioch interposed
matteo

  i wronged him once continued achmet-
 ibn-muros placidly his followers are
 assassins they are considering our
 deaths

  feizul stretched himself out again on the
 divan

  so it be with you grandfather i care
 not he said strike when you willcousin
 allah sends death in the right hour and if
 it comes now why should we mourn

  despite himself matteo was compelled
to admit a reluctant admiration for the
boys spirit but he turned upon achmet-
ibn-muros with redoubled ferocity

  you have lived a long life he rasped
 do you know how close you are to death

  aye grandson replied the prince with
a son of strife



some amusement i have lived long
enough to know death passing well-and
too the hearts of men

   tis no matter for levity a moment
since i hungered to bathe my hands in your
blood now-i know not this lads face
hath unnerved me

he is like her admitted the prince
that is one reason why i have loved him
yet you did not love her enough to---
i loved her enough to slay her for her
own sake retorted achmet with a hint of
fierceness

nay how could you protested matteo
she had left her people she had scorned
me her father she had put to shame her

intended husband she had-

  she had done no more than consult her
own happiness but tis of no avail to dis-
cuss that now you murdered her you
murdered my father your accomplice
hath paid his debt-where is el-afdels
head ali ha see you this tis in my
power to garner yours to place beside it

  i doubt it not grandson returned the
old man composedly i see plainly you
are a warrior of prowess i have never been
bearded before in my own palace but you
are also a frank and a christian and i
think it begins to irk you to slay men in
their beds

  why should it snapped matteo did

you feel restraint when you-

  ieizul reared himself upon one elbow
impatiently

  slay if you would cousin he said
there is over-much of talk

  a red mist swirled in front of matteos
eyes he leaped forward dagger raised to
strike- but the face of horazahde shone
white and clear against the sanguine back-
ground his hand fell nerveless to his side

  i can not i can not he groaned

	then desperately he recovered self-
control

  look you you who call me grandson
he said and you too beardless one i
am come tonight on my own mission of
vengeance that i dismiss for that i am
too weak for the task or else a higher will
than mine doth constrict my hate but in
some sort i am obligated to sinan what-
ever may be my personal feelings i cannot
wholly set aside his aims in any case i
must render myself to him for judgment if
i permit you to escape

  not so grandson interrupted achmet-

ibn-muros eagerly stay here at emesa
with me i have wronged you tis true
that is an old story and all that may be
said about it will not make it right yet
stay with me and i will do all i may to re-
pay the debt i owe-a double debt i know
matteo shook his head

 it cannot be you are a saracen i am
 a christian you are too late grandfather
 the harm is done you should have remem-
 bered in time

 i will do what i can to right the wrong
 the prince replied with simply dignity

 mayhap but tis more than you or any
 other man can do now heed me will
 you take pledge by allah and all you hold
 dear to give over persecution of sinans
 people and property and to render him aid
 at need

 i will do so

 matteo turned

 kafur

 the chief of the assassins stepped to his
 side

 give heed to the oath the prince takes
 by allah and the prophets beard and
 my own honor i swear to keep peace with
 sinan and to aid him at need

 you hear asked matteo

 kafur bowed

 is that all he replied is the prince

 to live

 there is to be no more slaying i will
 not be questioned tis i who will be
 responsible for this before sinan

 kafur bowed again

 that may be messer matteo but
 there is a certain form to be followed

 he clapped his hands softly and the dour
 crew of assassins gathered around him
 brothers he said you had an order
 we had they answered as one

 was it not to return until you had
 slain

 it was

 there is to be no slaying brothers but
 you are to remember the order

 matteo stepped forward

 i will be responsible for these men he
 said hastily

 nay lord objected kafur you may
 not come between them and an order

 he turned to his followers

 kneel brothers

 they knelt before him with knives drawn
 the way is open brothers he said
 gently


adventure

  the knives flashed in unison the points
plunged into every breast they fell for-
ward in a single line

  the eyes of achmet-ibn-muros kindled
with appreciation

  allah give me such men he cried
such men will win entry here a second
time at need warned matteo repressing
a shudder of horror at the ruthlessness of
the deed and now kafur why do you
not sjay yourself you have forced these
men to die

  the time is not yet returned kafur
composedly i must make report to
sinan if he pleases doubt not i shall
die

  the man is right spoke up the prince
a captain should always make his report
he will agreed matteo grimly and
he and  are like to pay dearly for it but
it grows toward dawn and we must depart
i might bind you but i leave it to your
honor to raise no hue and cry

  ali withdrew the knife he had been hold-
ing conveniently close to the old mans
throat and achmet-ibn-muros rose with
the spring of youth

  go with allahs favor if you will not
stay he said yet you shall be always
in my thoughts grandson i have learned
much this night as perchance have you
that blood you condemned so bitterly
playeth strange tricks with a mans heart
and hatred runs easily into love

  it may be answered matteo wearily
but between us stretches a sea of that
same blood you spilled

  not between you and me cousin said
feizul-ibn-khalid extending his hand
you are a great warrior and i am only a
boy but i am guiltless of what hath
passed will you accept my gratitude
you do not share the blame any more
than should i acknowledged matteo
farewell cousin

  the strange pair the old white-bearded
man and the smooth-faced youth stood by
the divan and the long row of dead assassins
and watched the three survivors depart
matteo looked back once from the doorway
there was a mute appeal in the eyes of
achmet-ibn-muros but he steeled his heart
and passed out into the passage that the
slayers had swept clean of life

  in the court of pomegranates matteo
missed kafur the assassin did not re-
appear until they were half-way to the grove

behind the mosque in which the horses were
tethered

  where have you been asked matteo
sternly

  there were a few others of my people
answered kafur they had business to
transact-concerning a certain order
perchance even sinans thirst for blood
may be appeased commented matteo sar-
castically as he mounted his horse well
ali

  the old turcople extended the gory head
of el-afdel

  what of this lord

  to ali maakwaa messer matteo dan-
tioch was not merely the famous jongleur
but the son of messer gui the lord of
nerak and himself by rights a lord

  fasten it to your saddle ordered his
master  twill be a bribe to sinan to
permit kafur to live another month

  a month or a year what matters it
returned kafur phlegmatically

  and at the end of all things is paradise
derided matteo

  at the end is paradise repeated kafur
tranquilly dawn approaches lord and
we should ride

they turned their horses toward the far-
off line of the lebanon hills behind which lay
massiaf but they had not ridden far when
ali lifted his hand in a gesture for silence
hark he exclaimed

  they listened and faintly borne to them
on the night-wind came the thud of hoofs
on the earthen track

  we are pursued said matteo i did
wrong after all to spare them

  kafur shook his head

  as to doing wrong i have naught to say
messer matteo but there is only one horse
behind us

  why that is so agreed ali but he
rides exceeding fast

  matteo frowned

  i desire no more traffic with emesa
spur on comrades

  they increased their pace but the rider
who followed them gained without effort
the sun was just flooding the eastern sky
with a belt of gold when he appeared on the
near horizon galloping swiftly his white
surcoat blown out behind him like a pair
of gigantic wings

  let be decided matteo abruptly it
ill suits our dignity to seem to flee one man
we will await him
a son of strife



  they halted by the track and the lone
rider galloped toward them his horse main-
taining tremendous speed without visible
effort the beast was bay in color with
white hoofs and uncommonly large for the
arabian blood that showed in delicately
modelled limbs and satin skin the rider
drew up abreast of matteo and threw back
the hood of his surcoat or burnous

  he was feizul-ibn-khalid

  a fair greeting cousin he said

  what means this demanded matteo

  naught save that it ill becomes a son
of princes to permit a benefactor to go un-
rewarded answered feizu simply

  you would wipe off the debt of your
life asked matteo amused

  nay that i can not but i would show
appreciation cousin

  as how

  feizul swung down from his saddle and
led his horse to matteo

  this is el-manzur the victorious he
said his sire was a moorish barb from
el-andelus his dam was the queen of the
stables of emesa he hath never been
beaten he is fleet as the wind-as you
have seen he is tireless as a desert stallion
he is gentle to his master terrible to his
masters foes i prize him beyond anything
in my gift therefore i give him to you

  matteo was touched

  a royal gift he approved none the
less cousin tis not fitting that i accept
i spared you for a reason beyond my con-
trol although i am neither frank nor
saracen i ride with the frankish hosts
i am your enemy

  you are my kin replied feizul and he
pushed the bridle of el-manzur into mat-
teos hand i am resolved i will not be
refused

  he started to walk away over the earthen
track toward the far-off minarets of emesa
silhouetted against the sun-stained sky

  but hold cried matteo following him
and leading el-manzur i cannot let you
go so

  el-manzur whinnied low as though to add
his own protest

   i can walk as well as any replied feizul
all i ask is that you will be kin to him

  matteo pressed to his side

  at the least he said you must take
my horse in exchange tis no fitting return
for el-manzur but-

  he will recall you to me whenever i

ride him exclaimed feizul aye cousin
we will do so but first i will make you
known to el-manzur

  he placed his hand on the bay stallions
flank

  ho splendid one he said take
heed to your new master

  the bay pawed with his hoofs and shook
his head and silky mane

  he hath never felt the whip or spur
continued feizul

  he never shall

  you make my heart glad he comes at
call or whistle if you would have him
increase his gait bend to his ear and whisper
your message and no matter how fast he
runs he hath always some reserve of speed
if you will but give him two secret words-
awaa lukos can you remember

  matteo repeated them

  now dismount cousin

  matteo obeyed and handed to feizul the
bridle of the horse he had been riding

  hither el-manzur summoned feizul
and the bay nudged between the two of
them nuzzling first one and then the other
this is your master the lord of your life
the provider of your food your comrade in
battle

  the bays eyes peered into matteos with
an almost human candor he lifted his off-
forehoof and extended it daintily matteo
laughing yet impressed took it in his hand
the bay whinnied and brushed his cheek
with a velvety nose

  he trusts you said feizul i think
you will be kind to him cousin he is
worthy of a warrior who is neither frank
nor saracen but greater than the greatest
of either race

  for the gift i thank you answered
matteo as for the praise i do not merit
it but let it pass

   tis honestly meant rejoined the boy
leaping into the saddle of matteos mount
give thought some time to one who wishes
you well

  that will i cousin and remember your
kinsman without a name

  nay urged feizul your name is all
the better for being selfearned but i think
we shall meet again allah guard you

  he patted the horses neck and galloped
down the road in a cloud of dust el-
manzur sent after him one whinny of fare-
well then cuddled his nose on matteos
shoulder


adventure

  certes muttered matteo to himself
if i failed of my mission none the less have
i won a prize may the virgin aid me to
live to joy in it

  he was not happy as he thought of the
interview he must have with sinan

chapter xix

how matteo compounded with sinan

the terrace atop of massiaf was de-
serted save for the spidery figure of
the lord of death sinan listened without
comment to matteos account of the jour-
ney to emesa shown the head of el-afdel
he eyed it with casual curiosity and bade
ali toss it into the gulf he dismissed
kafur with a curt nod which the assassin
accepted with his usual absence of ex-
pression then sinan focused his attention
upon matteo

  some men including frankish lords
might think you had bungled your task
he shrilled in his high whining voice
what have you to say

  little enough retorted matteo there
is no more than i have said i could have
slain achmet-ibn-muros and i did not my
life is forfeit to you for those of your men
though there was no need for them to have
died

  no need no need gibbered sinan
there was an order given when i give
an order-to a believer-it is obeyed
there is but one excuse-death

  this time one who is not a believer
failed returned matteo and he is not
afraid of death

  doth he crave it asked sinan his
head perked birdlike on one shoulder

  nay i am young i have left much of
life unsampled

  sinan cackled with glee

  what a fool you are you have for-
feited your life and you come here to me
the lord of death why did you not forget
all about me and go away

  because my honor would not permit me
to escape what i was responsible for i
promised you achmets death

  hee hee hee giggled sinan may-
hap too you knew that my arm is long
heh you did the wiser thing-after hav-
ing first played the fool oh i dont say
there was no reason for sparing achmet
i think he will keep his oath and a live ally

is better than a dead enemy but having
set your mind to a deed you should have
done it messer matteo i fear you are
a fool

   tis more than likely assented matteo
bitterly

  but honest it seems amended sinan
that in itself is a consequence of being
a fool still an honest man is useful yes
very useful i have in mind even now
a use i might have for you which would
cancel the debt you owe me

  no more slaying replied matteo i
will not buy my release by such means
sinan giggled hilariously

  slaying who would think of slaying
why should i wish to slay nay you
wrong me or have listened to idle tales
this is a mattter touching upon your re-
ligion

  as how

  my conversion

  and sinan wobbled upon his throne with
the excess of his mirth at the amazement
in matteos face

  your conversion what mean you
nothing less than i have said two
small words messer matteo but there is
a weight of thought in them see you-
sinans manner became confidential-
these templars pester me to distraction
there is no way i can come at them and they
thrive upon their immunity taking joy in
irking me in everypossible manner but how
if i become a christian and go about the
conversion of my people how then
what could they do

  they would be helpless admitted
matteo himself baffled by this whimsical
idea

  aye so i am sending you to jerusalem
to tell king amalric that i am ripe for the
gospel and would have him supply me
priests and conclude a treaty of alliance
send your own people suggested
matteo

  i did so once but the templars caught
and slew them notwithstanding they were
under the kings safe-conduct

  that is true agreed matteo i recall
it but mark you lord if you accept
christianity you will have to abandon your
way of rule how could you delude your
followers with the garden of delight if they
were christians

  sinan shrieked with pleasure
  christians yes in so far as i make
a son of strife



them and whatever they might be they
would always believe in the garden of
delight there are few men can resist that
i own i was worried when you beat me but
to make sure i sent out some days since
and caught a fat friar on the coasl-road and
now he is one of the most valiant of my
slayers ready to die in a moment for the
privilege of returning to the garden

  but do you think the king and the
priests would tolerate your slayers

  tolerate- are you a fool beyond mea-
sure why should they not tolerate a sure
weapon against their enemies there is
a kurdish prince hath won much repute in
the land of babylon one salah-ed-din
men say he will yet rule all islam what
think you your king would say to the death
of salah-ed-din but such matters are not
for debate take my case to amalric
nay lord how can i objected mat-
teo with the best will in the world to
obey you yet i am attached to the service
of prince bohemond it is scarce likely he
will permit me to leave him so soon again
sinan pondered on his throne a twisted
hump-backed bundle of skin and bones and
heavy robes his lambent eyes flickered
over matteo thoughtfully

  there is reason in what you say he
said at last but fear not bohemond will
agree to your departure

  how know you that lord

  sinan cackled derisively

  i know and another thing messer
matteo you are through with antioch
through-i do not understand you
aye through with antioch would you
remain always the favorite jongleur of a
prince may your gods have pity on you
that is a poor ambition

  i am as ambitious as other men ad-
mitted matteo

  as how

	the terrible old man shot the words at
him accompanied by a lowering glance of
his blazing eyes

  i would sing songs and fight and win

a greater name-

  and vengeance have you fulfilled
your hatred tis in my mind there is
another you have marked down for enmity
one you have slain one you have par-
doned-or so i gather one remains un-
met

  de chappes and his son said matteo

    egypt

  aye de chappes and he hath a son
you say humph tis better there are
ways to make two suffer where one can only
die have you thought of that

  aye lord

  then bethink you too that you in
antioch can scarce find means to come at
de chappes in jerusalem or nerak heh
 tis true

  therefore i say to you go forth from
antioch jerusalem awaits you did not
the king and the young prince baldwin
applaud you when they lately visited
bohemond aye my spies overlook noth-
ing i said i know all and i do know all
in jerusalem amalric will welcome you
and soon prince baldwin will have more
power than now he doth in that time
i think you will not be among the lowest
who ring the throne

 what mean those words gasped
matteo

  hee hee hee chuckled sinan i
know all i said and sometimes it chances
i know what will befall

  a cool breeze blew across the terrace but
matteo was conscious of the beads of sweat
that formed on his forehead it was not
easy to match wits with sinan he mus-
tered courage for defiance

  look you lord he began and by
effort he kept his voice level it seems

that you design to make use of me-

  and shall as in the past pay liberally
interrupted sinan

  that may be but i would have you
know i do not respect you or hunger for
your regard or praise

  in short commented sinan appreci-
atively you do not like me

  i do not like you why then should
you seek to aid me

  because good youth came the cold
answer you can be useful to me dead
you are good for nothing living by the
operations of fate you are potentially help-
ful to the plots i work upon deal fairly
with me and i will deal fairly with you
tis all i ask

  matteo shrugged his shoulders

  i can say no more he returned you
can not charge me with deception now
what is this message i am to carry to the
king remember lord i shall speak out
my mind to him and say what i please if
he asks my advice

  ho ho ho tee hee hee cackled


adventure

sinan big words tell the king what
you choose but fail not to give him the
message in writing i shall cause to be de-
livered into your hands

  and then i shall be quit of your ser-
vice rejoined matteo it hath been to
the advantage of neither of us

  sinan burst out again into obscene mirth
advantage he mouthed be not too
sure there may be advantage and there
may not let the years prove it you have
your ring i know you are honest-and
a fool tee hee hee

  he clapped his hands and as before the
black mutes came trotting from the gate-
way with his litter

  the garden of delight is always open
to you messer matteo he quavered as he
shambled into his seat heh scorn it
not tee hee hee

  i could slay him before they might
reach me whispered ali eagerly to his
master

  and we should be cast into the gulf to
join the other carrion at its bottom no
he is a friend if evil and we shall need
friends if we fare to jerusalem

  why that is true lord assented ali
who had been silent over-long for him
welladay i shall be nothing loath to con-
tinue adventuring who knows what
prizes may come our way jerusalem is
a rich city and many foreign men-at-arms
and pilgrims to be plucked in the wine-
shops and a bicker every week or so on the
marches with emirs to be unhorsed and
ransomed aye for all the ugly look of
him the old one read us an apt lesson
matteo made no answer he was sud-
denly conscious that his thoughts of jeru-
salem were concerned with one person-
and that one neither king nor enemy
a fair face beneath a coronet of red-gold
hair in one moment the lissom figure was
hidden in a yellow gown in the next it
stood revealed in boyish leathern breeches
it required an effort of will for him to bring
up the scowling features of renier de
chappes and his son and he must flog his
hatred against them

  kafur reigned in his horse at the fork
where the road from the orontes valley
joined the great coast road from jebleh to
antioch

  so far only do i ride with you messer
matteo he said but before i go i must
place this packet in your charge the old

one bade me say twas the message he dis-
cussed with you

  matteo accepted the bundle of parch-
ment wrapped in silk and sealed with black
wax and the sign of the fist and triple-
bladed dagger

  and you he asked are you suffered
to live on

  kafur smiled mysteriously

  when my time comes i shall go but
why look forward to death

  you are a puissant man-at-arms spoke
up ali roughly my master would give
you service if you wished it

  that would i absented matteo

  the faithful dog serves one master
returned kafur nay my allegiance is
pledged but i am your friend messer
matteo and prithee bear me in your
mind

  i will kafur and so farewell
el-manzur was chafing at the bit and
kafur turned off the road to give the bay
room

  nay not farewell lord admonished
the assassin it may be we shall meet
again

  i trow not retorted matteo i have
made an end of traffic with your old one
kafurs answer was a smile he spurred
his horse into a faint track which led across
country and soon disappeared in a copse
beside the river

  two hours later matteo and ali entered
the river gate of antioch prince bohe-
mond himself was dismounting in the
palace courtyard when they rode in and he
and john the englishman gave them a
hearty welcome

  the tilting was vile this afternoon
growled the prince st remi aid me but
i craved diversion come you to my cham-
ber matteo there is a fresh barrel of
cyprian and you shall tell us of your ad-
ventures you too john

  so matteo told in detail of his ride to
massiaf and his sojourn in that strange
place and how he and the assassins had
journeyed to emesa and what transpired
there and how his cousin feizul had given
him the horse el-manzur and finally of
his return to massiaf and the bargain he
had compounded with sinan

  the prince quaffed bumper after bumper
of the heady cyprian without any effect
upon his head as was his wont and listened
enraptured until matteo mentioned the
a son of strife



promise he had given to carry the old
mans message to king amalric

  what he broke in release you to
amalric your old one may be a slayer of
princes but there are some thingshe can not
force me to whilst i am in life nay nay
matteo the message we will forward by
a sure hand but you i can not spare i
have been sufficiently ill at ease the while
you have been absent on this venture
matteo would have answered but john
the englishman sitting just behind the
prince made a signal to him to desist

  that is a matter we need not fret about
for the nonce dear lord said john what
we have to be thankful for is that matteo
hath returned unscathed from so perilous
an errantry

  afterward that night john came to
matteos chamber

  you must humor bohemond he said
but are you in sooth anxious to visit
jerusalem

  aye lord

  i feared as much well there are
weighty obstacles in your path but take
heart time and patience will alter opposi-
tion-and i think that when you go i will
go with you

  matteos face lighted with pleasure

  i might not ask for more than that
messer john and touching the obstacles
i have much confidence in the ingenuity of
sinan tis a shrewd scoundrel and a
cunning

  a week passed and matteo did not again
refer to his mission to jerusalem he re-
sumed once more the routine of his court
life jousted with the young knights and
squires sang and recited for the prince and
his nobles then one morning came a
change de pugne as usual brought the
news

  an embassy from the constable of
armenia he announced bursting in upon
matteo without ceremony and he hath
fetched hither the most beauteous troupe
of dancing girls this side of paynimry
matteo who had seen the beauties of
sinans garden of delight was interested
to inspect the new arrivals as he walked
with francois through the palace they
heard the strains of music from the hall of
audience from the door beside the dais
they viewed an amazing spectacle

  bohemond leaned forward in his chair
chin on hand gaze fastened upon the dozen

dancers who swirled in muslin draperies
before him to the accompaniment of persian
musicians his lords and knights were
somewhat uncomfortable spectators with
him several priests were scuttling from the
hall with shocked expressions on their faces

  is this babylon or a christian city
muttered de pugne

  nay i know not answered matteo
then caught the eye of john the englishman
who motioned him toward the dais

  now is your time murmured john in
his ear ask him again

  matteo took sinans message with its
black seal from his wallet and stepped up
to the princes side

here is a matter presses for decision
lord he said king amalric waits for it 
bohemond waved him impatiently away
do it if you must messer matteo you
are over-anxious to leave us twould seem
but we shall be amused

  as matteo descended from the dais one
of the armenian suite a tall man in a high
felt hat slipped by him

  you see sinan hath found a way were
the words he whispered in matteos ear

  matteo started the figure was vaguely
familiar could it be kafur but the man
had disappeared in the crowd before he
could identify him

  what hath irked you asked de pugne
who had stuck by matteo did not the
prince say ves to you that was a clever
thought of messer johns look you mat-
teo i am for going with you i have had
enough of bohemonds madness i am
master of my own sword and i will even
try amalrics service for a spaqe men say
he is stingy but forward in joust or open
field will you have me comrade

  right gladly responded matteo you
speak in a good hour but here is messer
john you seem joyous fair lord

  john the englishman made a gesture of
disgust

  i have this moment acquainted bohe-
mond that i too was leaving him he
snarled but said naught i can stand much
but tis passing decency when a christian
prince takes a harem into his court it is
an evil stroke that the lord constable hath
launched

   twas not in truth the constable
i think lord said matteo

  and he told of sinans promise and of the
whisper he had heard in the hall


adventure

  so john the englishman pursed his
lips in reflection now what seeks sinan
from such a ploy doubt not he hath the
constable in agreement with him for i knew
one of the armenian knights who accom-
panied the girls-and told him my thought
of his mission too

  mayhap he desires to assure himself of
bohemonds inaction the while he intrigues
with king amalric suggested matteo

   tis that assented john aye you
have put your finger on it lad well what
may we do against a diseased mind tis
time we sought other scenes you too
de pugne good i shall have excellent
companionship in my venturous old age

chapter xx

tiie death op amalric

from the eminence which was crowned
by the ancient church of st stephen
the four travelers looked down upon the
northern walls of jerusalem the far-flung
line of battlements the domes and towers
of the churches and palaces the close-
packed blocks of houses stretched from the
valley of jehoshaphat to the valley of
gehinnon with the bulk of mount moriah
dominating the picture

  streams of people were pouring toward
the city pilgrims from overseas merchants
of many lands peasants from the surround-
ing country knights and sergeants squires
and men-at-arms priests and monks

  as matteo and his companions ap-
proached the gate of st stephen they ob-
served a look of depression almost of fear
in the faces of many beside them there
was no talking horsemen hung their
heads clerks told their beads as they
walked the peasants and burghers dis-
played open grief weeping and wringing
their hands

   prithee fair sir said john the english-
man to a knight of the hospital who was
ahead of them in the line waiting to pass the
customs officers within the gate why is
there so great dolor this day

   tis easy to see you have journeyed
from a distance messer responded the
hospitaler our lord the king hath been
ill and now grows worse men say he can
not live

  in sooth that is bad tidings agreed
john but even kings must die

  as for that said the hospitaler amal-
ric is a good lord but men fear for their land
and their own bodies if he dies his son
prince baldwin is but a youth the native
barons and the foreign lords from overseas
wrangle among themselves concerning who
shall advise him and the saracens grow
stronger day by day

  the line swayed forward at that moment
and john gave courteous  thanks to the
knight

  it seems we are come in an anxious
hour he said to matteo

  all the more reason why i should push
on and discharge my errand matteo re-
plied

  and i find me a lord to serve as soon as
may be said de pugne

  youth rides in haste smiled the old
jongleur yet sometimes youth is wise

  they rode as rapidly as the congestion
permitted through the street of st stephen
to the left hand rose the truncated pile of
mount moriah capped by the buildings of
the praetorium the quarters of the knights 
of the temple and the splendid structures
of the templum domini and the palace of
solomon as they passed the corner of the
via dolorosa and entered the wide square
in front of the church of the holy sepul-
cher they were obliged to pick a careful
path between the close-packed ranks of
pilgrims who knelt at prayer for the sick
king

  the enormous hospital of the knights of
st john resounded with the chanting of
priests but it seemed to the travelers that
the knights in armor who lounged by the
entrance wore expressions of boredom
rather than piety at the next corner john
the englishman who knew the way of old
turned into the street of david which trend-
ed eastward through the city toward the
palace enclosure on mount moriah

  the guards at the palace entrance halted
them while an officer of the household was
called he had attended the court on the
kings visit to antioch and remembered at
once the young jongleur who had sung at
prince baldwins behest john the english-
man needed no introduction he was one of
the best-known men of any degree through-
out all the lands of outremer the hero of
innumerable desperate ventures and daring
embassies let alone the echoing memories
of his once matchless voice and glorious
melodies
a son of strife



  at another time no two would be more
welcome said the chamberlain but
today we sit and mourn and misunderstand
me not messers if i say there is more call
for priests than jongleurs

  certes we would not seem to enforce
ourselves upon you answered matteo
but i bear a message of import from one
sinan who is called the old man of the
mountain

  a message from sinan repeated the
chamberlain in amazement the king
hath ever had an interest in that strange
man but his illness grows upon him and

i know not-

  at the least suggested john the eng-
lishman permit messer matteo to see some
official of the court

  aye returned the functionary after
a moments deliberation i will call upon
messer william the archdeacon of tyre
he who is governor to prince baldwin
perchance the prince himself will wish to
hear what you say tis he in sooth now
governs the realm

  he bade the guards see to the comfort of
ali and the horses then conducted them
into the palace the anterooms were
crowded with people lords and ladies in
silks and velvet stuffs knights of the house-
hold in the mail they never discarded while
on duty emissaries from the italian trading
cities potentates of the church jesters and
jongleurs whose gay raiment made bright
splotches of color against the drabness of
the throng-but whose instruments and
voices were muted and stilled

  bide you here directed the chamber-
lain at last at the threshold of a curtained
door where foot-sergeants stood at rest

  courtiers whispered and plucked one
another by the sleeve eyeing the strangers
with puzzlement a gray-haired knight
came up and recalled himself to john the
englishman matteo stood wrapped in his
own thoughts but de pugne soon distract-
ed his attention

ha matteo muttered the young
knight there is the demoiselle brygas
and he added as matteo looked up
instinctively and her two sour-faced
guardians

  matteo could not avoid a smile as his
glance strayed from the merry countenance
of brygas de kergac freely expressing her
combined delight and surprize and the
frowning features of renier de chappes and


his ill-favored son brygas waved him
a greeting her uncle and cousin after a long
look of savage displeasure turned their backs
upon him but matteo found keen satisfac-
tion in acknowledging her greeting with
a pointed courtesy which they turned away
too late to miss

  my faith she is a fair maid quoth de
pugne her uncle likes you little twould
seem

  nay you overstate it francois mat-
teo corrected him he hates me

   tis misfortune for you condoned
francois with somewhat empty sympathy
he would never accept your suit

  matteo was amused

  my suit you are mad my friend and
for yourself let me warn you he intends her
and her estates in brittany for none other
than his son

  as he said it something within matteo
rose up in silent rebellion against the glib
phrases no less pronounced was the spok-
en reaction of de pugne

  that slovenly varlet jeered francois
zounds twill be a sorry day for chivalry
when a fox mates with a roe deer i think
we shall confess ourselves less than men if
we permit it

  matteo would have answered him but
the curtained doors swung open and the
babble of the courtiers was suspended as
the chamberlain ushered out two men
yet not exactly two men for although
baldwin had the stature of a man tall
well-thewed broad-shouldered the face
under his tumbled mane of yellow hair was
the face of a boy thoughtful beyond his
years intelligent reflective but neverthe-
less the face of a boy a boy who had been
unspoiled by royalty

  his companion was a priest of imposing
appearance and authoritative manner but
it was the boy who spoke first with a quick
flush of interest

  why tis messer matteo the jongleur
he said certes i am glad of your coming
-and yours too messer john and this
young knight whose face is familiar to me
you do well to visit us at jerusalem even
though it be at a time of sadness but i am
told you bring a message to my father from
sinan

  that is true lord said matteo

  and what is this message spoke up
the archdeacon of tyre in a grave voice

  matteo took from his wallet the package


adventure

sealed with black wax and stamped with the
sign of the clinched list and triple-bladed
knife baldwin slit it open with the point of
his dagger and scanned the pompous
arabic phrases with a hasty eye

  he would turn christian he exclaimed
what think you of that arch-deacon

  i am more interested in what messer
matteo thinks of it returned father
william

  it means only sinans convenience
returned matteo frankly he does not
disguise that

  but it can be turned to rare account
declared the prince what now when
the kingdom is doubly troubled by my
fathers illness and internal dissensions
it could not have come at a better time
can you not see the chance it gives father
william

  aye agreed the churchman and it
occurs to me that we should deliver it to
the king tis a triumph for his statecraft
after all that so desperate a knave as sinan
is brought to asking terms of us and not of
the saracens

  baldwin clutched matteo by the arm

  it shall be done he cried messer
matteo it grieves me to say it but we know
not at what moment my father may pass
he hath been a king so long accustomed to
give orders and not receive them he
scouts the leeches and that hath been the
making of his death but what we may do
to ease his suffering we strive for

  i have two thoughts in my mind to
present to him sinans message to give him
heart and to hold you ready should he call
for a jongleur as he is like to do for he is
fond of your craft father william will
you take heed to messer matteos com-
panions

  the guards stood aside and baldwin led
matteo through an inner anteroom empty
save for men-at-arms and servants from
it they emerged into a great chamber at the
far end of which was a vast bed upon a dais
the chief barons of the realm stood in
groups by the door the patriarch and
several of his bishops were an imposing com-
pany mitres on heads pastoral staves in
their hands a knot of priests knelt before
a crucifix in a corner by the curtains of the
bed moved others-a shaven monk fat and
solemn a bearded greek doctor in a tall
hat a saracen hakim in turban and spotless
robes

  stand here murmured prince baldwin

  matteo stared about him while baldwin
crossed to the dais it was the strangest
scene he had ever beheld in many ways the
strangest he was ever likely to behold a
king was dying the fortunes of factions of
a country of a royal house perhaps of all
christendom hung poised in the balance

  stray bits of phrases floated to his ears

  will he really die he hath sealed
his own death-warrant how this
morning in his pain he besought the leeches
for a purgative the saracen and the
greek being men of wisdom denied him
but the monk yielded ha say you

so- there is word count raymond

of tripoli- who count ray-
mond-the kings cousin-he is riding at
loose rein he should be here by vespers
what say the foreigners to that oh
they belittle him they are overconfi-
dent aye de chappes hath said-

  matteo leaned closer at mention of his
enemys name he could not see the speak-
er behind the shoulders of several other
men but he hungered for further informa-
tion the next few words were indis-
tinguishable

  one way or the other we shall have it
out said another voice if de chappes
hath his way the adventurers will-

  a roar hoarse inarticulate came from
behind the swaying curtains of the bed

  i want no more of you leeches yhave
done your worst let me be i would die
in peace as becometh a warrior and a king
my name still means somewhat in paynim
ears aye here is sinan who calls himself
the lord of death asks humbly for my
suzerainty and will become a christian
what say you templars all sinan an
apostle of christianity sinan the lord of
death death phaugh must a king
die

  the leeches hovered on the dais steps-
but fled as the bed-curtains were wrenched
apart and the giant frame of the king
tottered into view supported and partially
restrained by prince baldwin

  the lords and prelates stood like men
enchained speechless only matteo sped
across the room and placed a carved oaken
chair behind the king amalric sank down
into its seat like a lion which has received
a spear-thrust in the chest his strength
was exhausted by the mad effort

  ha so he gasped i-would-pass-
a son of strife



in - open - always - hoped - die - in

-mail-

 his head dropped forward on his chest
 dear lord said baldwin gently this
 is the jongleur messer matteo of antioch

who-

 the kings head lifted again

where-are-knights he asked in
a guttural whisper i-would-hear-

rattle-armor-creak-harness-

 here is messer matteo the jongleur of
 prince bohemond will chant you a brave
 romaunt sire prompted baldwin

 the king roused himself

 ho jongleur of antioch his voice burst
 forth in a bellow such as had carried over
 many a stricken field a song-a geste-
 a romaunt-to which a king may pass
 matteo caught up a lute from a table at
 the dais foot

 the order is heard o king he recited
 in the ringing mellow voice of the jongleurs
 a brave romaunt for a brave king a tale
 of a most valorous knight and a demoiselle
 beyond compare like to the many who have
 ever delighted to honor the lord of jerusa-
 lem of their loves and their sorrows their
 trials and their pleasures hark to my lay
 good-good muttered the king
 hast-a-pleasant-touch-jongleur
 matteos fingers swept the strings in an
 impassioned tempest of melody

now they sing and they say and they

 relate he began

          

      

        aucassin was of beaucaire

        of the mighty castle there

        but his heart was ever set
        on his fair friend nicolette

 the golden voice filled the room now like
 a trumpet-blast now like an echo of fairy
 song the winsome tale fresh from the deft
 brain of its unknown provencal author had
 the company in thrall the kings features
 haggard and distorted by pain became com-
 posed his drooping head was lifted once
 more a dim light shone in his eyes

 the story continued alternating song and
 recitative to the point where aucassin
 armed himself to go forth to fight his fathers
 foes as the price of the hand of nicolette

shirt and hauberk donned the lad

laced the helmet on his head

        girt his golden-hilted sword

       came the war-horse at his word

        gripped the buckler and the lance

at the stirrups cat a glance-

  pass forward shouted the king in a
voice of thunder christ and the sepul-
cher pass-

  his head lolled back and he died

  prince baldwin eased the great body as it
slipped matteo dropped his lute and
sprang to aid him several priests and
barons hastened forward a spasmodic
patter of latin came from the corner where
monks prayed before the crucifix there
was an abrupt silence it seemed to matteo
as though a chill wind blew through the
room he found himself shivering

  the king is dead pronounced the
patriarch baldwin reigns

  baldwin reigns repeated the company
like children conning a lesson

  men began to leave the room eager to
spread the news and matteo drifted on the
tide toward the exit he was surprized to
feel a pressure on his arm and looked over
his shoulder into baldwins face

  at your service lord king he said
  baldwin gripped his hand fast

  you are the first to name me so he
exclaimed  tis an omen of friendship
messer jongleur i like you had i my
way as messer william the archdeacon
will tell you i would forego the duties of
kingship and be a jongleur like yourself
aye a trouvair a singer of songs a teller of
tales but my niche is fitted for me and
i must fill it so i say to you again be my
friend tarry here at jerusalem

  lord it would please me to serve you
answered matteo with a thrill of liking for
the comely open young face but may-
hap your lords-

  most of my lords are old enough to be
my father and ever thinking on that fact
returned baldwin impetuously you are
wise yet near my age and have no politics
to serve i need you will you stay
aye lord yet what will the bar-

  i care not what they say or think i
choose my own friends there are sorry
days ahead my father trusted me he
knew the dangers that would come after
him and gave me warning of all those
about me only two may i trust father
william the archdeacon and you

  and me you have known a scant hour or
two smiled matteo

   tis long enough you have a rare
voice messer matteo you shall be the
kings jongleur aye so it shall be


adventure

      chapter xxi

the banishment of brygas

baldwin sat very straight and stern
in his chair of state at the head of the
council board behind him stood matteo
at his left hand were seated father william
of tyre and john the englishman whose
sage wisdom was prized at any court of
outremer at his right hand sat his cousin
count raymond of tripoli the premier
baron of the realm lean silent alert on
the opposite sides of the long table were
ranged the chief feudatories of the kingdom
including the grand masters of the tem-
plars and the hospitalers

  now that my dear lord and father hath
been fitly laid to rest with his ancestors
lords we are met to discuss the proffer of
sinan whom some call the old man of the
mountain announced baldwin as you
know it was my fathers policy to endeavor
to weld him to our interests notwithstand-
ing my lord the master of the templars
would hear none of it

  nor will now sire if it can be helped
interjected the templar

  there is one opinion commented bald-
win impartially what say the other
lords sinan asks permission to accept
christianity and desires an alliance with us
the debate boiled up tempestuously all
along the table the native-born barons
and the master of the hospital-who might
be relied upon always to take the side hostile
to the great rival order-espoused accep-
tance of the offer the barons from over-
seas led by renier de chappes supported
the objection of the templar

   twould be a blemish upon our shields
to accept the aid of one so foul as sinan
declared de chappes moreover why
should we palter with his kind what aid
can he give us

  i would conceive any aid of value when
we are so pressed for men and the paynims
wax bolder every year answered father
william

  you are a priest messer archdeacon
sneered de chappes doubtless you do not
realize that one christian knight is equal
to ten saracens aye or a hundred also
we have an inexhaustible store of recruits
in our home lands

  where are they inquired john the
englishman

  they will come if we invite them
asserted de chappes confidently- to
begin with lord king tis meet to say the
fame of this realm will be increased when
due credit is given to those who have flown
to its defense from overseas

  baldwin frowned but made no other
acknowledgment of the covert insolence of
the remark not so the native barons

  does the lord of nerak and mardan
complain because he has too few fiefs to
hold called one

  what more do your people want that
they have not got inquired another

  will you have the king dethroned and
a successor elected from your number de-
manded a third

  faces flushed hands toyed with sword-
hilts baldwins voice subdued the uproar

  peace lords what savs my cousin of
tripoli

  count raymond replied without emo-
tion

  why sire it seems we are confronted
with a situation which passes speculation
the facts are before us the realm is
drained of men whatever the reason we
no longer receive sufficient recruits from
the devout in the frankish home lands
and now we have an offer of assistance from
one who is more feared by the saracen
princes than any other if he accepts
christianity tis the first triumph of the
cross outside our marches

  but as i have said there is no need for
argument let us have the truth of the
case from sinans messenger how now
messer matteo you are a wise youth and
withal a trusty by common report let you
give us your views concerning the matter
of us all you alone have had speech with
sinan what think you of him and his
offer

  the members of both factions gave over
their disputes and stared curiously at
matteo already in the few days he had
been at the court a legend had grown up
around his name the fame of his voice
and narrative gift had preceded him-and
the mystery of his connection with sinan
and the strange circumstances of his origin
served to intensify the gossip

  he did not hesitate his thoughts were
clear-cut-all the more definite because he
found de chappes on the opposing side

  by your leave lord king he answered
i agree with count raymond sinan is
a son of strife



wholly selfish in this move he fears the
templars he would never be reliable yet
if he seeks to make use of us why should we
not make use of him tis difficult to
believe the news of his submission would be
without effect

  you speak for sinans purpose cried
the master of the templars

  this man is half saracen in blood ex-
claimed de chappes

  aye he wears sinans signet added the
templar

  and i have known him aye and fought
beside him on occasion these past four
years messers interrupted john the
englishman he is as trusty a christian
as any here

  your words are no less than truth
messer john said baldwin swiftly but
twas needless to speak in messer matteos
defense i do not take it kindly that lords
should assail the kings jongleur

  nay sire you do us an injustice pro-
tested the master of the templars we
speak frankly out of our love of your person
and the safety of the realm

  then i prithee speak more wisely
admonished baldwin curtly

  there was nothing boyish in his manner
he was a king fully conscious of his king-
ship

  the subject hath been fully debated
lords he continued in my mind there
is no doubt we should accept an offer which
will win us prestige and time for better pre-
parations to guard the future but i shall
be guided by your opinions how sav you
all

  the native barons backed by the clerical
members and the master of the hospital
mustered a clear majority but the issue of
the vote did not serve to clear the air

  that is by for the moment said the
master of the templars with a bitter look
at matteo but there is another subject
of no less import sire which the council
should decide without delay

  to what do you refer my lord

  the boy kings voice was vibrant with
dignity

  throughout your minority lord i
think we are all agreed there should be
a guardian or protector of the throne and
who would be better fitted for the task than
one of your graces faithful barons

  there was a rustle of interest around the
board this was the moot question of the

hour who should have the guardianship
of the crown to which faction would the
rich prize go and would the result be to
create an uncrowned king and relegate
baldwin to the background

  you have a candidate for this post
i must assume asked baldwin smoothly

  aye sire who better than the lord of
nerak and mardan whose zeal for the land
and christs service have kept him on the

marches-

  acquiring fiefs from men who had died
in holding and upbuilding them snapped
the master of the hospital

  de chappes started up from his chair
  my lord he rasped you will make

good-

  but baldwin waved him down

  you are in the presence of your king
my lords he said simply i prithee recall
to yourselves that though i be young none
the less is the crown to be respected but
is your nomination the only one

  not so lord cried several barons of
the native faction

  count raymond should be named
proclaimed the hospitaler he is the
chief man next the king in the realm and
he hath been born and bred among us
nay de chappes clamored a group of
foreigners

  tripoli stormed the native barons
baldwin pounded on the table with his
fist

  there will be time enough to settle this
question lords he said consider among
yourselves and strive to adjust your dif-
ferences we will return to it anon for
the present the council stands dissolved
the council broke up in an atmosphere of
dissatisfaction and gloom the king with-
drew with count raymond and father
william and after a few words with john
the englishman matteo strolled into the
anterooms crowded with courtiers discuss-
ing the reports conveyed by the different
barons renier de chappes and his son
were the center of a furious group gesticu-
lating over the two slights which they con-
ceived had been put upon them by the
kings party

  from these two matteos eyes wandered
about the big chamber and lighted upon
the fair face of brygas de kergac she was
as usual surrounded by young knights and
squires but her glance crossed his and she
made a slight gesture of invitation at the


adventure

same time gracefully shaking off her atten-
dant train he hastened across the room
to meet her

   tis a vast honor to have speech with
you she jibed you are so preoccupied
with your friend the king or the lord chan-
cellor or count raymond or some other
great one that a mere maid of the court must
use diligence if she would come upon you
matteo laughed the dexterity of her
speech and her soft voice became increas-
ingly attractive to him

  the greatest honor i know of in jerusa-
lem is to stand by your side lady brygas
he said but certes there are those who
would deny it to me

  he lifted an eyebrow in the direction of
de chappes who had suddenly ceased talk-
ing with his supporters and was glowering
across the room at brygas and himself

  she frowned petulantly

  they are always at me do but look
at the face of manasses

  the countenance of the younger de
chappes was indeed like a thundercloud
so patent was their anger that it produced
in matteo a vague sense of exhilaration

  let them glower he laughed all did
not go as they wished in the council and
they have good reason to hate me afresh-
aye and their hatred shall not wane for lack
of material if i have my way with them
her face sobered

  you would do well to use care she said
seriously  twas in my mind to warn you
for that i thank you dear lady you
are still on my side are vounot

  i am ever on the side of a valiant knight

  but i am no knight-

  did we not have that out in antioch
  aye but-

  there are no buts in this cause messer
matteo what knight could have ventured
farther afield than you or won greater
honors

  nay replied matteo with beating heart
i have my greatest honor in this moment
brygas regarded him curiously

  i would i knew how far you might be
credited she sighed they tell wondrous
tales of you how all the ladies of antioch

and byzantium-

i have never been in byzantium
what boots that to a teller of tales
hah you may not answer me and at the
least you may not deny you are become
a very desperate hero of romance doth

not prince bohemond whom all know as
half-mad love you doth not sinan the
lord of death concern himself with you
ah but few know as much as i concerning

the winning of a certain ring-

  and prithee lady if you care for my
life see that none other comes to share your
knowledge interrupted matteo

  you are safe in my hands she reassured
him merrily but why should you fear
who are the favorite of the king

  our king is a brave king lady but over-
young and my enemies are powerful my
way is not an easy one to tread

  prithee then messer matteo in doubt
or danger take counsel with one who will
be vigilant in your interest even though
she be held in the enemys keep

  matteos eyes lightened

  you have ever been a maid to stir a
warriors heart truly i thank you and

shall call-

  brygas

  the cold voice almost at his elbow
caused him to slew around it was renier
de chappes completely ignoring matteo
her uncle drew her hand within his arm

  but lord she started to protest with
mutinous intent

  i must have speech with you elsewhere
de chappes cut her off

  but he could not cut off the look of fare-
well she threw back over her shoulder as
she walked reluctantly away

  she was not present that night in the hall
of audience when matteo and john the
englishman and other jongleurs and trou-
vairs-for the courts brief mourning was at
an end-entertained the company with song
and story in succeeding days he caught
stray glimpses of her always under escort
of her uncle or manasses then a week
passed and the court went hawking one
day beyond mons gihon

  matteo found himself separated from the
kings party he had ridden across the
fields after a young peregrine that had
missed its kill and swerved uncertainly in
the lower sky behind him he heard the
thud of hoofs and francois de pugne
rocketed up to his side

  have you seen brygas de kergac
matteo

  nay denied matteo

  she broke away when the peregrine
missed explained de pugne picking up
his reins i thought she rode this way
a son of strife



  i have not seen her

   tis likely that cur manasses hath
carried her off said de pugne morosely
i shall yet hew him from his saddle

  he cantered on and matteo rode after
the hawk which was dropping slowly in
erratic circles de pugne vanished in the
trees on the mountain flank and presently
the battering of hoofs sounded again behind
matteo he looked back expecting to see
another young knight in pursuit of brygas
perhaps even manasses but his pursuer
was the demoiselle herself he reined in and
forgot to notice when the peregrine soared
aloft to swoop on an unfortunate pigeon
if you do not wish nfy company say so
and be done with it she panted halting
abreast of him

  matteo laughed and the blood drummed
in his temples

  if i did he returned there are scores
who would slay me for a smile from you
the fields are covered with knights and
squires riding hither and yon in search of
you tis impossible to fly a bird for the
confusion you have created

  then are your troubles through me close
to an end she answered somberly

  what how say you lady

  her face lightened somewhat at the anx-
iety in his voice

  i am to be sent to nerak she explained
to be kept there until i vield

  yield

  oh until i give in to their threats and
agree to marry manasses my brutish
cousin who hath bullied and abused me
since we were children whenever oppor-
tunity served

  now matteo was aware of hammers that
pounded within his head and heart

  nay nay he cried out it can not be
then do you prevent it she retorted
fiercely her voice grated with anger
mark you i will not wed that ape sooner
would i cast myself from baldwins tower
they shall not force you he said and
the red mist before his eyes began to clear
but the pounding of the hammers continued
and he looked around in bewilderment to
see manasses de chappes galloping toward
them on a lathered horse

  so it is always she said they watch
me wherever i go oh i shall suffer for this
let me speak to the king

  to what purpose the king is but a boy
however much we may love him he hath

cares enough the saints know the father of
manasses is my guardian and every baron
would rally to his defense did the crown seek
to interfere with his disposal of my hand
you are right lady admitted matteo
but you have asked my aid and you shall
have it while i live you shall not marry
manasses

  but how prevent it she asked eagerly
  i know not but there are those who

love you-

  her face softened

  but not you she murmured

  matteo snatched her hand and pressed it
to his lips

  god knows i am not of those who may
look honestly for your favor sweet friend
he said but such as i am i am yours
her eyes shone with a great light but be-
fore she could make answer manasses reined
in at her side

  my father sends me to bid you return
to the kings company he ordered gruffly
with never a glance at matteo

  i am returning she answered shortly
  nay you are to go with me -
  i will not go with you she flared
  manasses lost his temper

  you shall be soundly punished for this
girl have you not been forbidden to ride
with the enemies of your family

  matteo leaned forward across her saddle
so that his eyes met manassess squarely

  mv counsel is that you give over abuse
he said gently the lady brygas waits
for messer de pugne who will escort her to
the kings company

  he had just seen de pugne emerging from
the wood on the lower slope of mons gihon
and head toward them

  any one so it be not you returned
manasses and maintained his position

  brygas looked up once to note de pugne
galloping into the road then turned her
head to matteo

  you will not forget what you have said
she whispered so low that manasses might
not overhear

  nay lady replied matteo sadly but
mayhap i have said too much i have no
standing with gentlefolk i may be the friend
of princes and kings but i shall always
be matteo the nameless matteo of an-
tioch matteo the jongleur

  the light in her eyes burned brighter
you are yourself she murmured
your fame is your own


adventure

  i shall serve you as i may but-

  he hesitated

  here is messer de pugne he concluded
inconsequentially as francois pulled up in
a spatter of dust

  look you comrade he hailed him
here is the lady brygas beseeching your
escort-and one whose conversation irks
her wherefore prithee deal gently with
her be cold with her annoyer and so manage
that you return to the kings side without
having drawn steel

  de pugne glared at manasses

i will not answer for this watch-dogs
safety he growled but the lady brygas
need not concern herself for his annoyance
he will keep his distance or feel the whip
manasses flushed uncomfortably

  brave words he sneered yet i have
my duty to do and shall do it despite you
it grows late and we must depart cousin
with or without this knights company
brygas paid no attention to him but
maneuvered her horse so that de pugne was
between her and manasses she waved her
hand to mat-teo

  forget not your pledge she called and
gave her mount the spur

  matteo could not trust himself to answer
he watched her and her strange escort out
of sight sitting as motionless as el-man-
zurs high spirits would permit

  i am mad he muttered to himself over
and over again who am i that-nay she
doth not understand i am mad-mad
ruin for both aye certes for her de
chappes i might humble but can i use her
for my ends nay nay blessed virgin
hear me i can not i can not

  he recovered some measure of self-control
and resumed his desultory quest of the lost
peregrine but his thoughts dealt en-
tirely with the coil in which he found
himself

  she must not wed manasses he reflect-
ed but who franfois perchance nay
nay i can not i can not and am i not
as selfish as de chappes francois is a
gentle knight and my comrade far better
he than-than-any other he loves her
he is worthy aye francois it should be
so matteo schooled himself riding at
loose rein very sore at heart forgetting
too as many men have forgotten that a
womans heart may not be schooled or
turned aside from an established goal

to be concluded

author of mis-

ijes finished readin about a feller
that gets sentenced to be cooked
electric for imbeddin a lot of num-
ber two buckshot in another gents
innards seems like these two wahoos
loves the same girl an both of em wins
out one of em wins the lady an a stom-

 below etc

achful of lead an the other gets a whole
page in the sunday supplement and the
right to apply for admission at the pearly
gates on an exact certain date

hes taken care of complete he knows
jes what hes goin to do course the gent
with the lead in his gizzard gets a couple of
goo lash



months start over the long trail but he
leaves unprepared so to speak he dont
get  time at all to buy him some new
moccasins or even ask directions

  on the other hand the shotgun-artists
got moren two months to read up on the
trail signs look over his mushin-outfit and
generally get ready for the trip yet hes
kickin he squawks an yells and hollers
an raves all over that supplement-page i
done spoke of an he winds up by an-
nouncin justice is blind

  he makes me sick hes jes like every
other weaklin that falls into a hole that hes
done dug himself he lands head-first on
the bottom sprains his neck an then lays
there hollerin for the neighbors to come an
pull him out an the very first thing he
does when he gets back on top is to cuss
out his luck an declare that justice is blind

  its sickenin she aint blind she aint
even near-sighted jes because way back
some fool paints her likeness with a bandage
over her purty eyes is no sign she cant see
it s moren likely she wears that rag to ease
the bustin headache shes got an its
purty near sure she gets that same head-
ache tryin to figure out a square deal for
us fool mortals

  believe me the lady can see all right
an give her a free hand an jes half a
chance an shell take a peek out from under
her blinders an dish up a square even
break for everybody every time some-
times shell do even bettern that lemme
prove it

way back in  manook is maybe
the most high-toned camp on the
whole yukon she aint very big
figgerin population an she aint none
spectacular as a perducer but she sure is
hide-bound an select an exclusive out
of a total gross population of purty near
forty souls-which dont reckon no injuns-
there aint no moren half a dozen chechakos

  all the rest of us is sourdoughs-old-
timers right an proper most of us has
been inside for ten years or more on
top of that every man of us tenderfeet an
all is miners an prospectors every galoot
in camp is a horny-handed son of toil an
a perducer

  plven rory mack who owns the pioneer
saloon puts in the summer workin a claim
on little eureka not that rory is a freak
or anywise different from barkeeps the

world over or that he labors that way
simply cause he likes the work

  no sir as a saloon man rory is twenty-
four carat pure an a thousand fine an he
lives up to the traditions of his tribe like
a true knight of the wet towel an the white
apron he toils through the summer that
way because while the waters runnin no-
bodys in town winters of course the
pioneer is open night an day an pgrvides
recreation an regrets for all hands accordin
to their means

  so you see we dont harbor airy single
dead-head the klondike strike is still
away off an so far the outside world aint
hardly touched us therefore no doctors
lawyers policemen an such is at all present
in our midst

  were a clean-strain high - toned on-
somble workin hard summers an passin
the winters by sleepin late mornins an
the rest of the time pleasantly lyin to each
other about our antecedents an accom-
plishments sometimes we varies this pro-
gram slighly by sniffin an sneerin at any
remarks or opinions our five or six tender-
feet may venture to air

  yes sir we sure do keep them yearlins
in their proper places so with plenty of
grub an a surplus of hootch life is full an
joyous an we aint got a thing to sigh for
except the dawn of another day

  well its along toward the end of septem-
ber most everybody has done arrived
in town an were all busy outfittin layin
in firewood an generally gettin our cabins
in shape sos we can hole up comfortable
for the long frost theres maybe two
dozen of us millin around in the store that
mornin when sharp an clear we hear the
splittin screech of the ilealys siren

  seein as shes the last boat of the season
that whistle means a considerable lot for
one thing it means the last mail for eight
months not to mention a big pile of news-
papers an magazines to hearten us through
the winter we even acquire some fresh
spuds maybe man we sure do swarm
down to the beach in a body an en masse

  an sure enough there she comes round
the i-lussian creek bend two white ribbons
of steam trailin from her stacks a big i
creamy wave a-curlin from her bows
stately an calm as a princess she sure is
a lady shes purty she surely is

  but all the same it seems like a year be-
fore she finally noses in an ties up in front


adventure

of the store her gang-plank no moren hits
the gravel before we start aboard but we
dont make it no sir half-way up that
plank we stop sudden

  then we back off slow an line up on the
beach hat in hand no they aint packin
no corpse ashore nothin like it on the
contrary the livest-lookin cheeriest-faced
little lady weve seen in many a moon comes
trippin down that gangway a-smilin an
bowin right an left as we open up to let
her through an she dont miss nobody
with that smile she makes a clean sweep
but she dont stop

  she heads straight for the store an
right behind her comes a injun deck-hand
staggerin under a whale of a trunk shes
goin to stay

  seems like we lose interest in them maga-
zines an newspapers aforesaid i guess we
even forgit to see about them chechako
spuds anyway nobody goes aboard the
boat until a whole lot later in the day but
you can gamble we keep a couple of eyes
apiece on jacks store an were rewarded

  by an by out comes the lady in tow of
jacks injun wife an the two of em mushes
up the trail toward jacks cabin now
course you understand that were a polite
and decorous bunch of hombres an none
whatever inquisitive concernin any lady
or her personal affairs but right away we
surge into the store an jack obliges

  seems like this lady is a nurse an shes
aimin to winter in manook way back
in poland somewheres she reads about our
camp in her home-town paper an learnin
that were plumb minus on white women
she bein without no kin or fireside ties
whatever decides to throw in with us

  she dont speak american very good
but she aint worried she figgers that talk
aint much necessary in her business nohow
cause she aims to make a livin by nursin
us when were sick well sir when jack
finishes his wah-wah we jes stand there
stupid a white woman in camp and she
figgers on nursin us

  shes a mile off the pay-streak scar-
face ed finally announces there aint
nobody been sick in this camp since sum-
mer before last-the time dutch bill et
that wolverine thinkin it was cub bear

  were lucky at that allows tommy
andrews speakin up quick we sure are
a fortunate bunch of wahoos he declares
while im proud to be a dweller in this

bustlin metropolis im free to admit that
up to now we been dealin from a short
deck but here comes this angel of mercy
an by her mere presence adds that last
refinin touch that makes us a full civic
body finished an complete

  another thing he continues i aint
feeling so well im all het up inside an
im sure feelin a heap bad

  you listen to me snaps dick peters
everybody starts in on this race with an
even break you give that lady a week
to get domiciled an acclimated before you
acquire any spontaneous maladies until
all hands gets time to line up for a even
chance youre goin to stay well

  which is fair enough nobody can kick
at that so everything bein understood
that way manook takes on her normal gait
an time starts mushin along same as
former nothin is changed except that
about forty of us spends the next week in
shavin sewin on buttons hatin each
other tryin on new shirts an figgerin
night an day on how to become the camps
first invalid

  in the meantime the cause of all this
here activity has done moved into one of
jacks extry cabins unpacked her duds an
settled down she makes a couple of trips
to the store an buys herself some grub an
thems the only times we get a peek at her

  but we hear a lot

  accordin to jack shes got a name thats
made out of nothin but ks and is
an looks like a noodle thats done had a
cramp jack states positive that nobody
can say that name without treatin every-
body within ten feet to a shower-bath

  he also informs us that the object of our
curiosity is a lady meanin that shes one
of them foreign nobility of some kind
tommy andrews chips right in an expresses
his belief that from her pleasant an gra-
cious manner shes probably a duke but
jack surmises shes more likely a countess
jack is a wise old owl so we take his tip an
countess she is to the end of the chapter
after which we weave along to our several
teepees to sit in solitude an figger some
more on how to get sick

as usual tommy andrews makes
the first bet

  he meanders down to the store
next momin an announces that hes in
awful agony he describes himself as bein
goo lash



right on the edge of the grave with nothin
but a toe-hold on a pile of loose dirt

  he coughs an spits an rolls his eyes an
yells to jack to send for the nurse quick
before its everlastinly too late theres
a few of us on hand when tommy pulls this
stuff so we throw him out into the street
an advise him to go see the nurse personal

  an blamed if he dont do it

  he takes our tip pronto hes sure got
some nerve at that he needs it for purty
soon he comes shufflin back slow an
dejected

  this time he does look sick sure enough
for a while he wont talk but after buyin
him a few drinks we learn that the countess
asks him a lot of questions about his habits
an customs an then advises him to go
home an cheer up

  you aint none whatever sick she tells
him in her broken american

  what you need is more sleep an less
hootch she states go to bed nights an
dont lake a single drink for a month

  an the poor clam promises

  an then she laughs at him

 poor tommys stack of chips looks
mighty small but the boys attempt bears
fruit an proves somethin this here
countess is a real lady an a sure enough
nurse no monkey-shines goes whatever
course we knew this right along but some-
how the proof of it cheers us up a lot

  so once more we disperse each galoot
once again filled with hope an longing
once more we unanimously selects our-
selves as the lucky victim that will eventu-
ally lead our white female population to the
mission chapel but theres a big fly in our
mush-tommy

  naturally after his crushin defeat nobody
tries to get sick any more therefore there
bein no patients the countess nursin busi-
ness falls off to nothin before it ever gets
started in the meantime mr tommy
keeps close cases on everybody an every-
thing then he cooks up a new scheme

  after about two weeks has faded into the
dim past he calls on the countess an re-
quests her will she take him for a boarder
he explains that while he lives plumb over
to the other side of town the walk to meals
three times a day will keep his mind off of
the hootch he aint drinkin an therefore
do him a heap of good

  he adds that hes a rank failure as a chef
an vows that he cant stand his own cookin

no more an these here last statements is
gospel tommy is probably the worst cook
on the whole river

  anyway he puts up such a pitiful plea
that he persuades her an mr andrews
becomes the first boarder in the first an
only boardin-house in camp the energy
an enterprise of that tommy-fox is cer-
tainly no less than amazin an ridiculous
hes a wise young fool that tommy is an
the camp loses no time in so informin him

  likewise five of our more enterprisin
spirits takes the trail he breaks an acquires
eatin privileges at the countess table bein
duly enrolled as holders of regular fodder-
tickets when things gets to this point the
boozshwah an the rabble lays off rightly
concludin that the race lays between the
lucky six

  then everything once more settles down
to normal or below an events starts fol-
lowin each other in their regular order
barrin sometimes when one of em breaks
out of line an crowds in ahead of its turn
the first time this happens is about a week
after the countess opens up her bean-
emporium

  were all sittin around in the pioneer
that night when in busts tommy a-wearin
a smile so wide he can whisper in his own ear

  gentlemen he shouts i win step up
all hands an name it

  well sir he sure startles us to put it
mild these liere remarks is wholly unex-
pected at this time an prematoor they
undoubtedly sets us back though of
course we know exactly what tommy
means dick peters voices our desires when
he says

  calm yourself then explain some
just what do you win

  the countess tommy busts out
shes jes promised me an were goin
to be married in two weeks come sunday
he gasps

  an she done gimme permission to
notify you all an to buy a drink he
finishes blushin

  heres to her and god bless her says
dick gulpin his at a swaller an may
you always have strength in your arm to
smooth the trail for her little feet

  considerin that dick has been played
as a favorite this is mighty right an hand-
some specially as he shows that hes bad
hurt spite of all he can do to hide it

  tommy an him shakes an then tommy


adventure

orders another round an it aint long till
were singin we wont go home until
mornin an we dont

  next day all the countess boarders re-
signs except tommy they feel that it
wouldnt be delicate in them to keep eatin
off a lady thats engaged an got a lot of other
things to think about besides rustlin grub

  at that were glad were through allows
rory mack its been a ordeal an us
boarders is mighty glad to be free

  now this here statement puzzles us com-
plete at the time us outsiders right along has
been plumb envious of the countess payin
guests but before long we learns somethin

  in the meanwhile time once more gets
a good grip on the gee-pole an mushes on
an progress slides along a few feet further
while the camp rests all we aim to do for
the next two weeks is to envy an con-
gratulate tommy about ten days slips
by then one momin this is what we see
tacked on the store door

             n o t i s
  i the undersigned hereby calls a miners
  meetin on tommy andrews at 
  oclock to nite p m this here meetin
  is for breach of promis in jacks store

sined

                          dick peters

  maybe you think this proclamation dont
start some excitement when i say that
the discovery of this here concise epistle is
equal to a bomb explosion on our main an
only thorofare im puttin it mild

  here we are a heart-broken bunch of
ex-romeos grievin daytimes over our lost
chances an spendin the brighter hours that
comes along with nightfall preparin to do
full honor to the camps first set of nuptials
an then-bang away goes our prospective
festivities like abustedballoon whatmakes
it worse is a iron-clad custom we got to wit
when notice of a miners meetin is posted
all hands is honor bound not to discuss the
matter at issue before the meetin is called

  take it from me by night were all
swelled up an ready to bust

      at five minutes to eight dick
peters breezes into the store that
makes it unanimous every man
in camp is already there waitin

  right away somebody proposes hank

somers for chairman an billy elms for
secretary theyre elected by acclamation
then dick states his reasons for callin us
together

   gentlemen he says i done called this
meetin to ask you to ladle out a lot of
justice to a rattle-brained skunk that sure
needs it through the triflin activities of
one of our number the fair name of this
camp is about to be smeared with a heap
of mud

   i dont aim to get personal but unless
tommy andrews goes through with the
weddin ceremonies he done promulgated
he breaks the heart of a sure-enough good
an sweet lady besides which he gets him-
self branded as a quitter an he blacks the
eye of this camp till it shines i dont fig-
ger we allows him to pull off any such play

  heres whats the matter me bein
tommys intended best man i goes to see
him frequent to cheerhim up an advise
him

   last night i moseys over to his cabin as
usual an just as soon as i get inside he
informs me that the layout is turned face
down an the games closed he announces
that he aint goin to marry nobody an
he refuses to give any reason whatsoever

   hang him yells missouri bill

  order the chairman hollers we
aint goin to hang nobody till we knows
exactly what for them kind of remarks
dont go-at least not yet

   wheres the lady old jack inquires
i move that rory mack be appointed as a
committee to invite her to attend this meet-
ing at once

   hes a wise old owl is jack

   rory bein duly appointed starts im-
mediate the meetin marks time

   in about fifteen minutes rory comes back
and reports

   it aint no use he states i seen her
an she wont come moren that she wont
say nothin about nothin only that she
positive refuses to appear against tommy
that she wishes him well an hopes we dont
hurt him an that her hearts busted she
starts cryin an i come away

   hang him missouri bill yells

  gentlemen scar-face ed hollers
jumpin up on the counter this here is a

-of a note its awful moreover this

is easy the worst an most important case
weve ever been called on to decide

  i dont know hardly what to say at
goo lash



all ed admits but i got a idea owin
to the aforesaid importance of this matter
i moves that rory be sent back to the
countess to request her will she accept the
decision of this meetin if she says yes
then i move you some more that we elect
a judge a clerk an a jury to try this case
regular court-fashion maybe we dont ever
get a chance to handle a breach of promise
suit again lets do her up in style

  second the motion hang him yells
missouri bill

  rory makes the second round trip in
lessn ten minutes

  i resign he announces soon as he gets
back inside i aint goin over there no
more shes still a-cryin an i cant stand
it she asks me will we let this thing drop
but if we wont she asks us not to pull off
any personal violence on tommy after
i promise her she agrees to accept any
verdict we renders an im done

  if we cant do anything to this here
culprit whats the use of doin anything
inquires scar-face

  hang him missouri whoops

  you holler that jes once more hank
cautions an you go out nominations
for judge an jury with the usual trim-
mins is now in order lets adopt scar-
faces idea an try this case accordin to
hoyle im confident we arrive at a verdict
that satisfies the countess an the camp
right there we make a record five
minutes is enough to elect hank sommers
judge an billy elms clerk while tom drew
is voted in as prosecutin attorney with
pete-the-pig slated as tommys lawyer
both tommy an the pig is plumb disgusted
with this selection but accepts because they
got to twelve names is grabbed out of a
hat an with the jury complete manooks
first court is organized

  the court comes to order says hank
whats the charge agin this polecat that
trifles with a ladys affections he inquires

  breach of promise your honor replies
tom drew an i move that the jury
retires an starts figgering out a verdict
the court hears what dick peters charges
an unless the defendants got a alibi whats
the use of anybody sayin any more

  say what kind of a trial is this here
anyway tommy yells jumping up
what for have i got a lawyer an what for
is this court for he wants to know real
peevish

  thats right declares tommys lawyer
suddenly wakin up you smarties done
elected a regular court an wished this here
job of defendin this wall-eyed piute on to
me you hollered for a trial with all the
fixins youre gointo get it seein that
the countess refuses to take a hand in these
obsequies i ask that the court appoint
some one to act in her place sos counsel for
the defense can get said party on to the
stand an bring out a lot of news favorable
to my client

  shes a good idea hank agrees
actin thereon the court hereby appoints
doc hatch to be the countess pro tem

  ill be hanged if ill be her totem doc
roars i wont do it i aint goin to be
nobodys wooden image why darn your
fool hide do you think cause im a old man
you can force me to clown for this bunch
of rattle-heads this here whole camp has
gone bug-house what do i know about
this crazy mix-up an i make a fine lady
with nigh on to a foot of whiskers dont

i you go to- he invites slammin

his cud agin the side of the stove where
she sticks an fries like a flapjack

  youll serve or ill fine you six ounces
for the benefit of the mission states the
court

  hank knows that the old doc packs a
fat poke of dust

  all right ill serve doc snarls an
look out for me he warns

  now that were provided with a plaintiff
the case is two-sided as the law requires
hank allows defense will start in

  call the countess snaps the pig

  old doc answers by haulin a bottle of
hooch out of his shirt an tiltin a whale
of a snort into himself then he glares at
the judge while he stows the bottle away
offerin nobody nothin after which the
old coyote ambles over to the witness chair
stows away a big chew of fine-cut an sits
down the ice is two inches thick on the
old mans face

  now this here cool behavior of the coun-
tess pro tem kinda flusters the pig but he
likewise salts away a chew hitches up his
pants an cuts loose

  youre a nurse i understand he re-
marks polite

  thats me doc agrees never battin
an eye im a nurse im nursin a dude
of a grouch an when i gets this peeve
nursed an coddled into what i considers a


adventure

healthy an robust condition im goin to
turn her loose on the officers of this here
court i got a idea that when the finish is
complete you embryo law-sharks is gonna
wish you never was born

  lookin at you makes me wish that
right now the pig comes back now
madam in spite of the fact that youre the
plaintiff in this here case im figgerin that
youre goin to be on the square an i
hope you bears up through this tryin ordeal
with calmness an fortitude was you ever
married

  i was admits doc back in montana
in  i was married to a widder for moren
two months

  that was nice the pig beams

  youre a liar it was fierce doc
explodes

  well anyway the pig allows you
got more or less savvy of married life that
makes you competent to sustain what im
goin to prove

  your honor im goin to show that this
white-livered client of mine is plumb justi-
fied when he declines to buy chips in this
matrimony game

  im goin to prove that marriage is a
brace game wherein the wheel is fixed to
stop on any number that carries the ladys
chips

  im goin to point out that any time a
ladv leads a gent to the altar shes inveiglin
him into a lifetime session where she holds
four aces an a pick-handle agin his bob-
tail straight all the time he cant win

  moreover we leave the countess who
is sure enough a fine woman an a real lady
an a heap too good for this fool tommy
plumb out of this trail from now on im
certain this court departs from the estab-
lished customs of our spotless judiciary an
refuses to drag any ladys name unduly
into the public view instead we picks on
her proxy who is a tough old pelican with-
out hardly no feelin nohow an we lays
bare his married life an proves thereby that
man breaks the most trail when mush in
alone

  go ahead you brayin jackass old
doc invites help yourself

  acceptin his own invitation he drags
out his bottle an lowers the high-mark
about two inches

  an lets see who wins out he adds
stowin the hooch away in his shirt

  i object to the plaintiff a-drinkin alone

in open court this way the pig protests
his mouth waterin i asks the court to
confiscate this old sots bottle

  this request makes a big hit with hank
who starts toward old doc immediate

  just a minute the old man advises
pointin his finger at the advancin judge
anybody that tries to bereave me of this
here bottle is goin to lose a heap of good
red meat besides you ought to be ashamed
of yourself a-tryin to lay your big rough
hands on a lady he tells hank grinnin

  hank sits down

  go on with the case he orders lookin
kin da red and foolish

  tell the court the pig commands
how come you to get hitched up to this
widder lady

  how do i know doc counters she
up an marries me same as all them females
picks out a weaklin an hog-ties him

  was you happy any durin the time
you was spliced the pig queries

  not me doc denies but i thought
i was

  fine the pig commends now then
what ends your married bliss

  a bull-whacker from fort benton
doc replies that spouse of mine grabs

  he weaves over to the witness-box an
sits down like hes plumb tired out could
he get it the remains of docs bottle is
plainly what he needs he looks so plumb

miserable that a wave of sympathy or some-
thin seems to roll over the whole room for
even the prosecutin attorney foregoes his
bullyin perogatives an opens up on
tommy with a soothin mildness thats
pleasant to see

  you-all he addresses tommy is
charged with persuadin a lady to promise
to marry you an then refusin to go through
with said contract yourself you know
how this camp regards a good woman as

adventure

as a yearlin calf bound down by my own
request to feed off that ladys table three
times a day forever an ever with no chance
or right to quit or complain compelled to
swaller them awful concoctions that she
makes world without end amen an i
endures it day after day an comes back
smilin an quiverin with fear meal after
meal

  ask the other boarders he begs

  i know i done a fearful wrong-twice
he acknowledges i hurts a good womans
feelins an i plays the quitter but nothin
you can do to me equals by half the mere
thought of eatin that grub three times
every day he chokes

  whatever was the matter with this here
grub tom drew inquires

  everything tommy asserts she
maybe cooks all right over in poland but
here her grub is nothin lessn poison while
them other boarders is there it aint so
unbearable bad but once they resigns an
she gets me alone - is sure let loose

  she switches clean off of regular fodder
an feeds me nothin but the favorite tidbits
of them home-folks of hers an its my be-
lief that theyre a zinc-lined lot of wahoos
the first dinner i eat alone with her she
springs what she calls a surprize she takes
a hunk of moose-meat a lot of onions an
maybe three or four cans of red pepper an
she brews a mulligan what she christens
goo lash

  when i first taste this here mash i think
the recipe is maybe mistaken but to please
the cook i take on a liberal allowance
though it mighty near kills me to do it
it was jes nacherally awful afterward
i got to drink moren a pint of hooch to
stop the burnin in my innards

  what you kickin about missouri in-
terrupts  pears to me any grub that
acts thataway is mighty near ideal

  you try mixin red pepper with rorys
hooch tommy urges

   nother time she meets me on the
street an shes all smiles he continues
shes jes discovered that jacks got a kit
of salt herrin in the warehouse which i
personal know them herrins has been in
camp for four years she confides to me
that im in for another palate-ticklin
jamboree

  an what can i do i got to go to

supper an eat them --herrins an say

i	like em an when i says that she gets

plumb tickled an makes me eat some more
gentlemen it was jes plain-

  hes almost cryin

  an how do you reckon she maltreats
them herrins he asks them not bein
bad enough as they are she boils the salt
outen em an then she dishes em up covered
with a gravy made outa molasses he fairly
yells she made me eat dried cabbage
cooked in vinegar an sugar she put raisins
in the soup im a wreck i aint goin
to take no more chances he vows hollerin
at the top of his voice

  without doubt these statements is sure
enough serious

  the court admits says hank weighin
his words careful that what you says
changes the bettin quite a little ive done
heard that them polanders is mighty ruck-
shus an all the time fightin an i believes
it if they feed on such grub as you de-
scribes they nacherally feels a heap sore at
everybody moreover without meanin no
disrespect im convinced that the countess
needs a lot of remodelin culinary

  but that dont bring us no nearer to the
end of the trail

  you admits that you turn this lady down
cold after she consents to become your wife
an for that we all knows there aint no
excuse no time nowheres nor no fit punish-
ment therefore since any more argu-
ment by either side is plumb futile there
aint nothin more to say so the court now
charges the jury

  you gentlemen- turnin to the jury-
will now retire to the warehouse an fol-
lowin the manner of juries you will pay no
attention to nothin except your own per-
sonal feelins an arrive at a verdict ac-
cordin but the court hopes that you will
figger out some kind of a punishment fitten
for this here tommy-somethin that makes
him a little slower in pledgin his word to
women an that also pays him for the wrong
he done an to make sure you so do the
court will accompany you an wield a
guidin hand during your deliberations

  you cant do it i object youre
crazy tom drew hollers all in one breath

  me too the pig shouts what kind
of a fool court is this here aint you never
been nowheres i thought you-all said this
was a regular court dont you know
nothin that jury goes out an deliberates
alone this here is ridiculous he declares
turnin to the jury for support
goo lash



  you bet it is hank snaps an you
take jes one more wallop at the dignity of
this court an it becomes tragic lemme
inform you of somethin this court
adjourns to the warehouse with the jury
the law specific pervides that when votin
out a verdict the jury must retire from the
courtroom were goin to obey the law
an im goin along to see that shes
obeyed

  all right tommy drew agrees then
im goin

  that includes me the pig chips in

  no objection whatever hank rules
moren that the court invites the spec-
tators to accompany us this camp is
proud of its judicial establishment an we
aint got nothin to conceal long as the
jury obeys the law by retirin there aint
no rule to keep us from goin along

  when all hands is inside the warehouse
hank locks the door then the jury as-
sisted by both attorneys an the spectators
groups up an starts discussin what theyll
do with the defenant

  the only ones that dont offer no advice
nor suggestions is hank an tommy them
two stands off to one side silent as is right
an proper

  finally everybody havin expressed his
opinion the jury votes into a hat writes
the result down an announces to hank that
theyve done agreed

  hank unlocks the door an we all file
back into the store soon as were settled
hank reads the paper one of the jury hands
him

  youre lucky he informs tommy
you sure get moren you deserve listen
here

  we the jury in the case of tommy andrews
an the countess an doc hatch finds a verdict
in favor of the defendant as follows

comes away it dont take no medicine-man
to guess that shes turned him down the
poor wampus heads straight for the mission
crawlin along slow an thoughtful like hes
packin his whole winters outfit on his
back its a mortal cinch that the mis-
sionary an them no-count injuns is about
to annex fifty ounces of tommys hard-
earned dust its mighty near too bad but
hank an that jury knows a thing or two

  when tommy comes out of the mission
door the missionary is with him an the
two of em points straight for the countess
teepee theyre in there maybe an hour
then tommy the missionary an the coun-
tess comes out an mushes over to the store
right away all hands does the same

  its amazin how everybody has got to
hurry out to buy somethin they dont need
an never thought of before

member me sayin a while back
that most everybody gets a even
break purty near all the time well
listen

  soon as all hands is inside the store the
missionary gets up on the counter an makes
a wah-wah

  my friends he says smilin mr an-
drews has jes presented to our cause the
sum of fifty ounces in the name of our
little mission i thanks him-an you mr
andrews explains to me his reason for this
generous gift but i thanks him jes the
same fifty ounces is fifty ounces more-

over i understands fully all the other
reasons that leads up to this donation

  now my friends its my job to lend a
helpin hand whenever i gets a chance an
believe me gentlemen this here is a lulu
of a opportunity understandin that mr
andrews sole an only reason for reniggin
on his promise to this lady was her inability
to-er-prepare food accordin to his super-
stition an beliefs i suggested that he mr
andrews engage the services of maggie
by-an-by a most estimable injun girl who
has been reared in our mission an who is a
first-class cook american plan i am
pleased to say that my suggestion was
adopted an carried out after which we
calls on the countess an mr andrews
assisted by me renews his suit

  i frankly tells the lady that there can
be no further trouble about fodder as miss
by-an-by is a grub-preparin  marvel after
listenin to the proper amount of pleadin
this splendid lady has done agreed to the
status quo ante helium an our little party
is now here to finish the job

  thats all-except that before i ties these
two lovin hearts together i makes a pot-
latch

  not feelin inclined to retain any money
presented to me under unduer pressure i
hereby hands the countess these fifty
ounces as a weddin present from the mis-
sion an the camp an eight hundred dol-
lars is eight hundred dollars

  then he marries em
author of the swordsman the green devil etc

there could be no doubt about
it any longer-the boy must go
he ought to have been driven
forth before possibly if the
father had foreseen this hour he would
have killed this the biggest of all his sons
at birth now however the hunting was
getting worse and worse from day to day
traveling was becoming more difficult the
wolves were taking most of the game and
the birds of prey the rest it seemed

  there was scarce food to be found for
himself and perhaps the mother whose
hunting-grounds lay to the eastward and
there was no more room in that part of the
world for the boy at all

  but the boy was full grown-there was
the rub and from what his father had
learned of him not one given to obeying his
commands readily

  the boy be it mentioned was a long
sinuous shape muffled to the eyes in most
exquisite soft fur crouched upon a snow-
laden bough above he was a european
lynx really but he looked with his cynical
mask fixed in a set grin more like a
fiend

  he was mostly long furry legs and huge
padded feet thirty-nine inches was his
length-not counting an idiotic bob-tail of
eight inches isabellin gray was his color
inscrutable were his green-yellow cats eyes

and diabolically cruel was his bearded face
for the rest he was a feline of the felines
furtive silent and mysterious obviously
such a beast was not lightly to be so to
speak shown the door

  then the domestic argument began and
a traveler had there been one so unfor-
tunate passing through the snowed-up
silence of the forest at that moment would

have imagined that all the fiends in -

inhabited it indeed the yells groans and
spittings were beyond description of any
pen one would have said that at the
least a dozen furies were doing one another
to death brutally

  as a matter of fact the father was only
bounding to a bough rebounding to an-
other and turning up at last pressed flat
upon the bough upon which farther along
his big son crouched

  the noises represented simply the two
trying to frighten each other for the cat
from the lion down is a strategist of the
first water and though no coward will
seldom fight till all other methods of gain-
ing victory have been exhausted

  at last slowly they sank till the snow
seemed almost to swallow them then
they sprang and the son passed clean over
his father striking wickedly down in mid-
air

  they landed and were instantly at each


b

adventure

other again then over they rolled fight-
ing like demons the son undermost it
looked now like a snow grave for him but
he roweled with his hind claws and with all
the power of his long hind legs

  from this devils clinch the two of them
rebounded ten seconds later-clearing them-
selves as cats alone can-rather redder than
when they went into it

  the son had a hole in his shoulder-a red
stream down his right forepaw staining the
perfect purity of the snow-and a gash over
the left eye his father had a clean scarlet
gridiron on his right flank a tear on the
left hind leg and a crimson belly neither
looked exactly like show pussies so to speak

  for two minutes those sinister secret
ones of the wild glared at one another never
moving a muscle and during that time
they worked out two facts in their subtle
feline brains firstly they had fought to
live secondly they must surely die if
they fought longer for they were too well
matched for any other decision

  then the son imperceptibly took a step
back and finally off insolent deliberate and
intractable he had gone at last-driven
from home to fend for himself

  half an hour later and about a quarter
of a mile away eastward a bull moose-
they called him elk in that land-straddling
and bending down a sapling for the brows-
ing of his supper turned his gigantic-
antlered head suddenly and stared with
little keen eyes at the rigid fading per-
spective of t rees around him

  he saw nothing and he heard nothing
yet being a wild creature he felt that he
was not alone any longer his instinct
whispered that he was being watched and
be it mentioned he who in the wild watches
citizen bull moose at close quarters does
so with his life in pawn

  still such was the watchers skill in
woodcraft that it is doubtful whether the
bull moose suddenly leaving his meal and
advancing with a threatening swing of his
five-foot antlers would ever have found him
if a raven black as a wicked thought flap-
ping above the tree-tops on some rogues
errand or other had not come to help him
and settling barked down vile language
at the young lynx belly flat and rigid
behind a tree-stump

  not until the moose his hoofs clicking
like castanets as he strode high in the snow
was almost towering over him did the lynx

move a hair then he went straight up
the nearest tree as if he had been shot there
and the raven shifted out of that tree as if
his life depended upon his quickness in quit-
ting which knowing the lynx it possibly
did

  nothing puls the cat folk into a more
evil temper than the ceaseless efforts of all
the bird people to advertise their vicinity
and so annul their best-laid plans for con-
cealment cats simply loathe being shown
up and the bird folk spend a great deal of
their time in showing them up

  the moose stood towering against the
tree-trunk staring up at him the lynx
himself flat along a horizontal bough glared
down at the moose

   then suddenly his attention was diverted
quick as thought his baleful glance had
shifted and he was staring into the branches
something had moved there something that
his sinister presence had made move a
little lump of snow fell with a soft sigh
another higher up it was invisible that
something it was a wild creature which
was keeping the trunk between it and the
lynx as it climbed

  presently came a little commotion it
seemed as if some wandering eddy of wind
had sprung up stirring the branches caus-
ing little lumps of snow to fall from several
places at once but there was no wind

  the climber whoever he was must have
caused that tiny commotion for he stopped
and the lumps of snow ceased to fall

  there followed a pause during which the
lynx remained still as a beast run into a
mold-all part and parcel of the bough he
was on

  then the climber began his invisible up-
ward course again and the commotion was
redoubled but albeit most stealthily

  then the lynx saw and seeing under-
stood

  it seemed as if some bird till then in-
visible had silently left the top of the tree
and sailed on a descending slant to the next
where upon arrival it vanished as suddenly
as it had taken shape another followed
a third glided to another tree a fourth
shot from branch to branch of the tree he
was on each as soon as it landed went
out so to speak with the same mysterious
suddenness with which it had come into
being none of them made a sound

  they just appeared trapezed across the
sky and vanished-utterly like ghosts
the hungry world



impossible almost in the dim snow-haze to
say what they were if one did not know
but the lynx knew they were squirrels
quite by chance he had happened in the
midst of a band of squirrels migrating in
search of food

  but the invisible climber who was he
he was certainly death or the squirrels
would not have broken their freeze
before him in that fashion and given them-
selves away to the lynx

  but what death there were many in
that forest all cruel all mysterious and
nearly all hidden the fact that he had
gone up however and not frozen or gone
down suggested that he was at least a
lesser death than the lynx

  upon that deduction the lynx acted

he did not so much move along
that branch as coax himself to the
tree-bole he peered cautiously
round staring upward and he surprized the
climber at its climbing it was a long
sinuous exquisitely coated sable it was
following the squirrels upon their migration
for upon them it lived

  possibly they had not known that it
existed till the lynx himself unknowing
had surprised it at its stalking just as the
raven and the bull moose had surprized the
lynx at his neither party concerned
looked pleased the squirrels being the most
likely to suffer looking least pleased of all

  then the lynx acted it was character-
istic of him possibly of all cats that he
delivered his ultimatum suddenly sur-
prize was the essence of his tactics he
shot straight up the tree-bole at that sable
like a living gray bolt-with one clean
cleaving spring

  in the same instant the bull moose
snorted-nay almost whistled-while a big
capercaillie three feet long and sending
all his seventeen pounds weight along with
every ounce of power in his big wings
hurtled above their heads

  the effect of these two things upon the
lynx especially was extraordinary he
heard them after he started his spring and
he changed his mind he seemed to twist
his whole body in midair with a wrench
that was visible and he came down again
upon the very spot that he had started
from like some great india-rubber ball

  he was just in time to hear a fox bark
a sudden gutteral warning to see the

sloping hindquarters and spreading pal-
mated antlers of the moose fade swiftly into
the pigeon-blue-gray haze between the
ranked tree-boles and to note that squir-
rels and sable alike had dissolved them-
selves as if by magic into nowhere

  he rebounded almost without touching it
from the bough he had returned to full ten
feel down to the ground and then went
over the snow as hard as he could go leap-
ing enormously

  a wolf came by going like the wind and
a white hare passed also both were ob-
viously pressed for time and took no notice
of each other

  some disturbance back behind made the
lynx glance over his shoulder as he bounded
from some death unknown which the action
of the other wild folk told him was greater
than he and what he saw sent him up the
next tree three dogs were coming through
the forest and dogs he knew spelled man
somewhere behind them

  the dogs ran straight to the tree the lynx
had just left and stopped then they
began to bay furiously and their voices rang
through the forest

  they knew their job those dogs they
had bayed the sable his skin was money
so did the lynx know his job his skin was
money too he had become part of the
tree he was on apparently he seemed to
have melted into the lines of the wood

  anon to the dogs added itself the figure
of a man on a horse galloping he came
with the dusk in a raw red light subdued
and churchlike among the trees he dis-
mounted and looked up the tree the sable
was on then he led his horse some dis-
tance away returned did something-
magic for all the lynx knew as he watched
with eyes that burned a faint green light-
in a circle which included both trees called
the dogs off retired among the tree-trunks
and-faded into the dusk he had gone
presumably without doing anything

  the lynx waited half an hour while the
forest remained as silent and lifeless as mid-
ocean and he concluded that that man
presumably had not gone otherwise why
did the giant eagle-owl in the next tree keep
up a soft and very very faint hoo-hoo
hoo-hoo to warn his mate who must be
somewhere about

  and why as the moon and the night
added themselves to the biting cold did no
less than three white ghosts of wood hares


adventure

stealing up along their own packed and
trodden snow-paths stop suddenly sit like
stone carvings and steal away again the
hares could certainly not smell him the
lynx or the sable there must be some
reason behind it all

  at last the lynxs quick eyes-burning
now dully in the night-marked the sables
lithe form slowly stealthily coming down
he was descending to follow his squirrels
the man by the way had searched for the
squirrel-trail first guessing he would find a
sable somewhere in attendance he ob-
viously could not stay there all night and
so thought the lynx he too was begin-
ning to know the meaning of the word
hunger it was long since he had fed

  moreover what seemed safe enough for
the sable might be safe enough for him

  he wanted to get away from that vicinity
badly there was something wrong with
it the eagle-owl was saying so in little
above a whisper and all the wild knows
that the eagle-owl is a very wise bird

  cats have a way of arriving in places
without seeming to have got there lynxes
especially which is why the lynx was
visible-if a gray shadow can be called
visible-leaping away in his grotesque
fashion bobbing among the trees

  the sable was doing the same in the
opposite direction-probably unaware of
the lynx-but more gracefully rippling
along with consummate ease

  then they stopped

  it was a most extraordinary happening-
just for all the world as if they had run
each into a brick wall and in the same
moment the whole of that silence rang with
bells

  the two of them had not of course run
into any wall they had run into a stout
net hung with bells which the hunter had
placed round the trees to entangle the sable
when he chose to come down sables being
far too valuable merely to shoot or trap
they must be taken unsoiled

  the sable went mad twisting himself up
hopelessly in the clinging horror he could
not see

  the lynx went ten times mad bouncing
about like some huge firework that had
gone off prematurely and was spitting and
exploding in momentary expectation of
blowing up utterly

  naturally the man and the dogs came
back at the gallop the bells had called

them from where they were waiting near by
but only one dog spotted and went for the
lynx he that great cat had not been set
down in the program

  nor had the net been made to hold insane
lynxes it did not hold him long the
dog arrived just in time to see him break
away bounding and capering crazily over
the snow more or less wrapped up in such
part of the netting as had parted he
looked like some dancing devil of the snow
and the night cavorting in derision in the
face of the moon

  promptly that dog interviewed him for
five and a quarter seconds by the clock
the man wondered what had happened
and he left off securing the sable to grab
and cock his rifle it was certainly a most
unearthly yell it came from the dog but
it might have come from anything on or
under the earth

  the lynx said nothing he just went
away bounding tremendously bits of torn
netting flapping behind him like pennons
and frightening him nearly into a fit the
dog did not go with him or anywhere else
it had gone already into the next world in
fact and the man found it lying bitten and
clawed to death upon the snow

  no beasts on earth perhaps can beat the
cat tribe in the matter of speed-for the
first few hundred yards certainly but they
are sprinters not stayers and need time to
get their second wind

  the lynx with his bounding gait covered
the first few hundred yards also at a speed
that left the other dogs behind then he
stopped to glare back his thin tufted ears
folded down his whole expression literally
fiendish and to shake his paws cat fashion
to rid himself of the incubus of the net

  but suddenly he half-turned his head
quivered and seemed like a stone it was
evident that he was listening to some other
sound besides the barking of the dogs some
other sound which possibly he alone could
hear

  then as if fear himself rode him that
lynx ceased to exist in that place and half
an hour laler traveling always eastward he
stopped dead

  something in a hurry was approaching
him--something leaping high along in great
grotesque leaps with eyes aflame and jaws
agape it was upon him in an instant
almost colliding with him it erupted a
volley of snarls shot into the air and to
joe monkeyface

one side striking with claws hooked and
cruel almost as swiftly as he dodged and
rocketed from sight up a tree

  he had just time to give vent to a shriek
which sounded appalling but was the lynx
way of shouting friend-just time to
notice that the climber was a female lynx
when the moonlit dark all about him filled
with hurrying shadows and with eves like
green fairy-lamps in pairs just time had
he to note these things and to leap for his life

  few beasts but a lynx perhaps could have
taken that leap and fewer still could have
got to the end of it-alive

 he was conscious only dimly as he
whirled through the icy air of a rush of the
clashing of jaws that gleamed of eyes that
shone leaping up at him of ringing muzzles
all but brushing his tucked-up hind legs
and of a confused medley of snarls and the
hustle of bodies

  then he landed upon the tree spun upon
himself to slash at a sharp wet snout leap-
ing up and breathing hotly almost in his
face bounded upward again and stopped

to look down upon the heaving flanks wav-
ing tails and steaming sharp snouts of the
baffled wolf-pack below

  for a long forty seconds he regarded
them then turned his head slowly to stare
at a form sleek silent and mysterious
that had slid up like a gray ghost beside
him it was though he did not know it
his half-sister and she had just been driven
out of her home by their mother whom she
also had fought and so being wounded
had drawn unto herself the famishing wolf-
pack on her blood trail

  and after that-well what did even a
wolf-pack matter after that in the face of
the great little god love the former
could not climb and were at full liberty to
go anywhere they liked both lynxes bent
down insolently and told them so in choice
lynx language one could have heard them
do it half a mile away and the giant
eagle-owl passing swiftly and silently over
their heads at that moment laughed hoo-
hoo hoo-hoo as if he understood which
perhaps he did

the shipping-master looked up from

thats the lot captain he said blotting
the last entry

hold on one more sir

captain deshay peered over the heads of
his shuffling mob

here you he called beckoning toward
the remotest corner of the room

  the boy he remarked as the official
took up his pen

  a gangling youth of age absolutely un-
guessable and appearance beyond describing
shambled forward with the aspect of a ter-
rifically beaten cur

  stand up lad stand up whats scaring
you the skipper tried to soothe him up
with your head and stick out your chest like

adventure

  whats your name snapped the im-
patient official

  the lad hesitated stammering word-
lessly

  come your name man

  joe-joe-joe monkeyface sir and ill
dance if you wont hit me sir

  the wretched travesty on humanity
shuffled clumsily with his feet whimpering
fearfully in the crowd of boozy outward-
bounders impatient to get their advance
notes and embark upon a final cruise of the
knocking-shops a drunken guffaw burst
forth stopped sharply by captain deshay

  last ship asked the official

  joe monkeyface shivered but answered
nothing

  dont worry him sir said the skipper
gently just sign him on shilling a
month im taking him for a hobby never
been afloat before im going to find out
what story lies behind that whipped-dog
appearance ever see anything like him
i never did

  wasting your time capn returned the
official crisply and began to clear his desk

  the crew passed out and captain deshay
took joe monkeyface and fed him bought
a few clothes for him and put him in a secure
place until he could take him to the ship
when his own business was completed

when the mutiades warped out
of the east india docks bound for
melbourne it was the dockers and
riggers who hauled the lines and passed the
tow-rope riggers set topsails and head-
sails before leaving in the tug and the ship
was left to bucket and wallow under short
canvas in the chop and churn of the nore
until her sweating officers could hammer
animation into the human hogs in the fore-
castle

  through all the chaos of a night-tide
sailing a cringing whimpering figure fled
from side to side and end to end of the
vague expanse of rope-tangled deck dodging
every moving man as if expecting a blow
it was the newly promoted second mate who
at last tucked joe monkeyface snugly out
of harms way in the potato locker

  mr earl was of a sunny nature ordinarily
the pride of his first responsibility as a
watch officer plus the surge of high pulsing
healthy blood in his arteries sufficed to
keep him elated and cheery even in the
midst of such a limbing and laming job as

that night sailing proved and still retain
sufficient human kindliness to see the help-
lessness of joe

  dont hit me sir whined joe and as if
forced by long custom his feet began to
shuffle on the planks

  hit you laughed earl lord love
you sonny i couldnt hit a ball with a bat
just now i feel so fine hop in here lad
no place for the like of you on deck

  with the mate to assist the spanker was
hauled out next and the captain himself
held the wheel

  all right the skipper said when earl
would have taken the wheel the spanker
sheets belayed carry on you two and
try to rouse out that bunch of drunks
wheres the lad

  in the spud-locker sir grinned earl
uncertain how his custodianship would be
received

  skulking

  no sir i shoved him in there to get
him out of the way looked like getting
hung in the bight of a rope sir

  hm best thing you could do
grunted captain deshay as you come
aft from the focsle bring the lad along
i want to give him a talking to before turn-
ing him adrift among the wolves forard
whatever the nature of the talk was joe
monkeyface entered the forecastle of the
miltiades with at least a show of manhood
it was four oclock in the morning before
watches were picked and half the men sent
below so that joe who was a day man
and had all night in-when he was lucky-
encountered none of his mates except as
tangible blots on the darkness until he was
turned-to at four bells to join the clean-up
and wash-down party on deck

  then after swallowing a pannikin of
scalding beverage which the ships stores
list misnamed coffee but which was pure
nectar to him joe stepped out to his first
encounter with the realities of the sea and
into the arms of a broom-laden able seaman
who abruptly dropped his brooms and
clapped his hand to his thigh with a crack
like a pistol-shot it was the seamim who
had uttered that appreciative guffaw in the
shipping-office at hearing joes given name

  hully sailor heres the monk lads
he roared and then crouched before joe
whose terrors had all resurged upon him
dance blast yuh dance

  like an automaton joe shuffled his feet
joe monkeyface



his hang-dog face turned fearfully toward
the seaman there was a certain rhythm
in his shufflings but also a decided sug-
gestion of numbing terror which made his
movements sheerly automatic

  dance yuh funny-faced cowson swore
the seaman known as cardiff and raised
his heavy hand over the cringing performer

  joe whined and shuffled faster but his
lips drew back from his teeth in a snarl
the snarl of a beaten cur when further
beating is threatened

  drop that cardiff

  the second mate burst in among the
grinning watch and seized joes arm

  you didnt ship to amuse a crowd of
sojering toughs my lad he said kindly
cardiff pick up that gear and start the
head-pump have no more of this funny
business or ill see what i can find you to
do in your watch below for a spell come
with me monkeyface

  joe was put to work on the poop brass-
work and gradually he assumed an aspect
of comparative security though as the
watch scrubbed their way aft and their
rough talk and laughter was heard clearly
he would start and polish faster as if he
dreaded to be caught short of his work and
beaten again

  mr earl watched him closely pacing
the weather side of the poop and passing
joe every few moments and as he took in
feature by feature the details of that
strangely unhandsome face and that bowed
cowering figure that should have been full
of youthful buoyancy and sprightliness he
marveled as captain deshay had mar-
veled what story lay back of it all the
watch had finished scrubbing the maindeck
and were dragging their gear on to the poop
when he stopped them

thatll do he said leave the poop
this morning get the running-gear in shape
bosun and make fast all boats and gear
to joe monkeyface he added leading the
way-

  come along the monkey-bridge joe and
clean the standard binnacle

  safely beyond overhearing by the helms-
man the second mate suddenly asked-
whats your real name

  joe monkeyface sir dont hit me sir
ill dance

  a curious spasm passed over the officers
face and he stared intently at the pitiful
figure joes expression might well have

baffled an older wiser man than earl for
it was to outward appearance a composite
image of ape-like bestiality inhuman cun-
ning and whimpering submission the thin
snarl at the lips might be anything from
stark cruelty to agonized apprehension

  dont speak of hitting mr earl re-
turned shortly and i dont want you to
dance listen my lad you had another
name once didnt you what was it

 joe-joe monkey-

  he stopped as he caught the second
mates eye

  i never heard no other name sir he
whined

  joes lips drew back farther revealing
broken discolored teeth that had never
known a brush and mr earl experienced
a sensation of revulsion that routed his pity
the rout was made utter when the curt
voice of captain deshay rang out on the
poop

  mr earl come to yer duty sir

  and when officer and captain met the
commanders face was dark with passion

  mr earl he said youll leave that
lad alone if ye please ill let no man bait
him-

  i was only- stammered earl con-
scious of his good intentions

  i saw what ye were doing the lads
suffered enough hell suffer more with the
crowd o barbarians we have forard ill
not let the after-guard practise on him
remember that now

sunrise after sunrise followed the
miltiades out of the channel and
into the emptiness of the sailing
routes of the atlantic what each sunrise
meant to joe monkeyface only he and his
creator knew when cardiff chose to
hammer the lad sending him on deck to
face the second mate with his snarling grin
painfully accentuated by cut lips mr earl
chose to ignore his hurts for his own hurts
were sore yet and would be for a long time
after what the captain had told him

  and yet joe monkeyface was not wholly
the whipped cur he appeared there was
a morning a dead stinking morning when
sea and skv had died and rotted from lack
of wind and the ship beat her heart out on
the slimy hillocks of blindingly glassy
wastes yards braced as tightly as wire
would hold them and every bit of canvas
furled to save it from whipping itself to


adventure

threads it was a hot reeking horror for the
doctor inside the galley

  joe passed along with the kids for break-
fast and reached the open door at a mo-
ment when the cook lifting a heavy pot
of burgoo from the stove slipped in the
grease of the floor and fell he grappled for
the nearest hold as the scalding porridge
nipped his almost naked flesh and brought
down in his fall a boiler of boiling salt water
waiting for the immersion of the salt horse
for the noon dinner of the other watch

  the doctors yells were lusty enough to
bring every man within reach stampeding
to the door that they hoped to find him
weltering in his dying gore perhaps ac-
counted for their alacrity for ships cook
never went to sea in windjammers whose
life was not greatly desired by the majority
of the rabble he had to cook for

  but joe dropped his mess-kids with a
crash burst in through the door and heed-
less of the searing scalding mixture that
bit at his ankles dragged out the cook and
dropped him on deck when the watch
gathered around joe was standing shivering
with fear mess-kids in hand gazing down
at the spilled and spoiled burgoo that was
to have filled his dishes then he abruptly
tumbled to the deck his scalded feet re-
fusing longer to sustain him and by his fall
escaped the terrific wallop aimed at his head
by cardiff furious at the delay with his
food

  cant understand that boy at all
growled the captain as he rummaged in the
medicine-chest for unguents and bandages

  i can i think sir returned mr earl
take a close look at his face and youll
find that what you take to be pitiful is
simply currish meanness i-

  why confound you captain deshay
stormed glaring up at earl you dare
speak like that of a lad whos game enough
to go into boiling water for a greasy doctor
ill ill- sir-

  the abashed second mate muttered an
apology and took himself off on deck he
had only heard of the cooks mishap and
now he was to find himself faced with an
amazing turn of events that must sway his
own feelings back again for he greatly
loved a brave man

  as joes injuries slowly healed it was mr
earl who made up in little kindnesses for
those days when he had allowed his mis-
judgment of the lad to influence his treat-

ment when able to carry on with his work
again joe had recovered vastly from his
earlier terrors and the second mate took a
keener interest than even the captain seemed
to and when one breezy afternoon joe went
overboard without hesitation to save the
mangy ships cat mr earl cast out of mind
any lingering doubt and set to work to dig
for the soul of the unlovely waif

  that daring plunge into the sea besides
causing a call for all hands to heave the ship
to and lower away a boat showed that there
were some things at least incapable of bring-
ing the glare of terror into the eyes of joe
monkeyface not even when the ship was
sailing on before heaving to leaving him
astern in mid-sea with a clawing spitting
yellow fury in one hand did the lads face
show fear rather the ugly features were
illuminated almost to beauty by a sort of
high courage that compared grotesquely
with his usual expression

  what ever made you so scared of a -
beating joe the second mate asked one
dog-watch

  joe was laboriously poring over a com-
pass card given him to study by the skipper
and to keep himself clear of ribald inter-
ruption from the men he was seated on the
poop bucket-rack at the question the
lurking fear again crept into the lads face
and he shivered

  youre plucky enough in other things
pursued mr earl youre getting hard
as nails too why dont you set about
some of the brutes who keep after you

  joe monkeyface shivered more painfully
and made no reply the compass card
dropped from his shaking fingers and mr
earl picked it up and handed it to him
he tried another tack

  tell me how vou got that queer name
joe

  the officers tone was kindly and the
softly spoken words seemed to soothe some
of joes fears he shot a swift glance up-
ward at mr earls face then lowered his
head and said dully

  i never knowed no different name sir
aint it a good un for the likes o me
suddenly he raised his head again and
presented a full view of his beetle-browed
ugliness in spite of his kindliness the
second mate smiled as the truth of joes
remark went home

  i dont think you can help your face
joe anyhow that name was never given
joe monkeyface



to you in kindness cant you remember
any of your kid days dont you remember
any father or mother

  me father was ung sir me mother
i dunno if she was me mother she used
to drag me around to the sojers barracks-
dunno what she went there for-and the
sojers used to call me monkeyface and shed
laugh and tell me to dance for the pretty
gents then theyd give me pennies and
shed buy gin with em so i wouldnt
dance once and she beat me she got
locked up after that for drunk an dis-
orderly so i kept on goin round dancin
but i never got no pennies cause she
wasnt there-only plenty o beatins

  joe shuddered sharply at the memory
and went on repeating his compass points
with painful perseverance mr earl
watched him narrowly saw the healthy
tan of the sunny salt air and noted the
supple turn of back and shoulders which
even the grimy rag of a shirt could not
entirely conceal then laughed as he con-
trasted joes plucky rescue of the cook and
his dive for a mangy cat with his whipped-
dog aspect when fear of physical beating
obsessed him he wondered now how he
ever mistook the pitiful expression of the
lad for inherent or acquired meanness and
suddenly resolved to take upon himself
what he conceived to be captain deshays
intention the development of this waif of
the city streets

  listen joe he said when the men
have hammered you didnt you ever hit
back

   no sir

  the old whining note crept back into
joes voice his small eyes shone like a
cornered cats

  shake yourself together man snapped
earl listen i want you to be a he-man
joe ill stand by you next time cardiff
or anybody else wallops you just fly at his
face like a blooming wildcat and hammer
him with feet fists teeth anything until
he drops or quits

  understand tts not the sort of scrap-
ping a man likes but youve got to make a
beginning joe and i want you just once
to see a man drop under your hands
thatll give you a whale of a lot of pluck
and next time perhaps youll be able to
quit using your teeth and later on your
feet but first of all get the winning habit
thats all you want will you do it if

you dont youll be a whipped dog all your
life

  yes sir joe replied huskily but his
face went livid and out from it pallor stood
three dark seams on either cheek-bone and
across the low brow which caused mr earl
to catch him by the shoulders and turn his
face around to the sun

  he peered hard at the dark lines and
cursed fervidly

  holy sailor so thats why you look so
crooked about the face is it who ever
beat you like that joe

  me father sir when i was a kid becos
i spilled a drop o beer i was fetchin for
im sir

  mr earl was shocked no wonder he
thought the poor devil was called monkey-
face but nature never gave him such
warped features no wonder either that
the lad cringed at thought of a blow upon
that battered face

  hm well joe nobodys going to re-
peat anything like this your bones were
soft then anyhow if you dont take one
chance pretty soon youre going to smell

-forard there and the worst part of the

passage is yet to come hit back lad hit
back

     i joe monkeyface hit back
i wflj cardiff cuffed him on general prin-
i ma  ciples as he passed and in a second
was encumbered with a panting clawing
glaring horror that clung with its legs and
tore with teeth and nails

  cardiff was no chicken-hearted tough
he was a bully but a courageous bully and
when he got his breath back he set to work
to pound joe off it was not until the fight-
ing pair had torn through the crowd of
amazed seamen like a cyclone and joes
back was almost broken against the samson-
post that cardiff shook him off and finally
dropped him with a half-hearted punch in
the face

  with the blow weak though it was joes
fighting essay terminated he fell away
whimpering all his glorious frenzy gone
from him but it was noticeable that
cardiff didnt follow up his advantages and
it was remarked during the days that fol-
lowed that cardiff refrained from baiting
the lad and regarded him furtively with a
sort of nervous uncertainty as if not at all
sure that the next encounter would be as
easily won
adventure

  as for joe he seemed unaware that he
had scored a partial victory the memory
of that blow in the face lingered and mr
earl despaired of ever inducing a second
attempt at retaliation joe appeared not to
notice that he was left alone but he saw
readily enough that he had displeased the
second mate and even the captain looked
at him queerly

  better let him sail his own traverse
sir earl told the captain the men
dont seem so eager to pass him a wallop
since he chawed cardiffs ear half off and
maybe hell find himself as time goes on and
he isnt hammered so often

  i believe youre right captain deshay
rejoined the lads been too badly scared
to easily shake it off hows he getting on
with his work

  slowly sir he keeps what he gets but
it takes him a long time to get it hasnt
mastered the compass card yet though he
knows a lot of the ropes seems that he
wants concrete examples for everything hes
told put him on a rope and tell him the
name and he remembers it but point out
something out of reach and he cant seem
to get it i pointed out the catharpins to
him yesterday and he dont know them
from the catheads today

  captain deshay walked the poop for a
while in silence glancing around the bright
horizon sniffing keenly at the sharp air
the bells were struck a man passed to re-
lieve the wheel and he wore a muffler the
skipper smiled

  mr earl when that sort of shell-back
wears a muffler to the wheel hell wear
mittens tomorrow and shoes the next day
and its a sure sign the ships creeping south
i thought i smelled ice send the lad along
at eight bells and ill find him some warmer
togs hows the shaky fore-royal-mast
holding

  got a preventer backstay up first thing
this watch sir it seems stiff enough

  all right watch it and keep a sharp
lookout

soon the crew of the mutiades
were too busy to think of bothering
joe monkeyface captain deshay
was noted for quick passages and this was
to be no exception sailing far south as
near to a full great circle as the crozets and
kerguelen land would allow winds were
strong seas high and ice frequent double

handed wheels constant look-out wet quar-
ters and decks too often swept for any work
other than sheltered work to be done men
had no time for idle horseplay that is a 
resource for the lazy tropic weeks when
warm sun and full fare make hot blood and
devilment

  but the chill bitterness of the incessant
cold and wet frightened joe and the skipper
saw it he put the lad in the galley to help
the cook the warmth and comparative dry-
ness soon put renewed confidence into joe
and very quickly the doctor whose memory
for services rendered was weak put most
of the work upon him forgetting or ignoring
the fact that joe had saved him from very
serious hurts

  joes initial awkwardness was not helped
or lessened either by friendly advice or by
the giddy gymnastics of the ship running
before the howling westerlies he dropped
the joint for the cabin dinner one noon
smashing the skippers favorite gravy-
channeled dish and all but spoiling the beef
on the filthy deck

  joe was sore enough for he knew the
skipper was his friend and knew that the
damage would annoy him but the cockney
cook gained nothing by rubbing it in the
doctor appeared at the forecastle door while
the watch were at dinner reeking with un-
speakable muck

  hullo slushy wots up piped a young
a b edging farther away someat

dropped-

  dropped squealed the doctor dancing
with rage and showering all hands with
grease of the vilest  oo told you anyfink

wos dropped -blime that bleedin

joe monkeyface goes an e drops the skip-
pers favrit meat dish an i says to im

   wot yer goin to drop nah hey yerve
been an smashed the old mans gravy dish
into little bits yer bloomin hape wot
next yer goin ter drop hey

   you e says big as billy be-

an e ups and ooks me in the perishin beak
wiv is elber an capsizes me into the bleedin
slush-tub

  wheres lamps i want some ile to
git some o this muck outer me hair

  captain deshay heard of it through the
mate just as he was considering sending for
joe to wig him for the damage instead of
the wigging joe received all unconsciously
the emphatic approval of at least two men
who were his friends for when the mate
joe monkeyface



went on deck to let mr earl get his dinner
the captain was still at the table and to-
gether they chuckled over the little incident
to such a degree that improved digestion
compensated both for the slight short-
comings in the dinner

  it looks as if the lads coming into his
own in his own way the skipper said
ill bet dumping the doctor into the slush-
tub was an accident if the truths known
but its shown joe that he can capsize a man
anyhow ill say nothing to him about that
dish and if the doctor bellyaches to you
mr earl about joe you tell him to mind his
eye or joell pull his pluck out and fry it for
him in his own fat i dont like that cook
anyhow

  strangely enough cardiff showed an
abrupt change of front toward joe after the
cooks mishap from regarding the lad
with a smoldering eye as if ever watching
for a chance to down him without fear of
those terribly clawing hands cardiff be-
gan to speak to joe and even offered his
tobacco-plug one bitter screaming forenoon
when the weak royal-mast tottered and a
preventer stay parted in a howling snow-
squall

  it was killing work for three hours and
every man from captain down to joe mon-
keyface was needed joe found himself
holding on to a rope turned about a pin
for cardiff who was setting up the new
preventer-stay waist-deep in freezing water
as the seas thundered in over the rails and
though his frozen hands were jammed and
bruised over and over again in the block-
sheaves joe hung on and even cardiff a
sterling sailor if a rank bully found it in
his heart to offer the tobacco-plug

  joe grabbed it much as his namesake of
the simian family might nibbling at it
cautiously peering under his brows at the
giver as if doubtful of its innocuous qualities
then at cardiffs gruff urging he bit off a
quid and smiled joe monkeyface actually
accomplished a smile it was a weird and a
wonderful thing in truth that smile it
contorted the lads grotesquely ugly face
into the semblance of a gargoyle but it
was a smile a genuine smile and it awed
cardiff into suspicious silence as soon as
he could the seaman gently relieved joe of
the marlinspike he was holding then and
not until then did he breathe freely and
return joes smile

  but cardiff was a bully born and he

simply had to have a butt to worry he
turned around after that mornings experi-
ence and badgered the cockney cook until
that worthys life was a cold doleful misery

things were much at this point
when the miltiades sheared through
thin mush ice one night when moon
and stars were hidden under a slowly falling
driftless blinding pall of heavy snowflakes
the double lookout one on each knight-
head stamping to keep warm stung by
flakes of snow as big as albatross down
peered through the murk from sheer in-
stinct hopeless of seeing anything ahead
in time to avoid it the captain and both
mates were on deck mr earl on the fore-
vard adding his youthful eyesight plus
youthful keenness of enthusiasm to the
other more automatic watchfulness of the
lookouts

  cant ye see anything foreyard
shouted captain deshay anxious and
irritable from long vigil

  nothing sir replied the second mate

  back like a shot came the echoed query
and reply like a cannon-shot came the
impact of the jib-boom driven by a moving
force of two thousand tons and in the next
instant all head-gear buckled inboard with
a crash the iron bows crumpled and a
spire of solid ice one hundred feet high
tottered and crashed down in an avalanche
of colossal splinters some of which increased
the damage on the forecastle most of which
clattered down upon its own base and sent
the thunder of rolling ice broadcast over
the sea

  swing out the boats shouted the skip-
per running forward wheres mr earl
good- did ye not see mr earl

  the fore-royal-mast long weakened by
heavy rolling had fallen on the first impact
but only the frail royal-mast quite fell the
topmast stood hanging over the listed side
perilously and mr earl flung from his
perch swayed out over the white void on a
running rope which swiftly rendered through
the sheaves dropping every instant be-
tween the wounded ship and the nebulous
monster which held the potential doom of a
stricken iceberg

  men cut and hammered at the boat-
fasts the mate hastily sounded the well
the berg was invisible but vaguely dis-
tinguishable through sense of chill and the
ship sullenly seemed to be backing away


adventure

from her antagonist as if determined to hide
the shame of her sinking and mr earl had
dropped like a plummet somewhere out
there between ship and ice clutching the
rope that had failed him with the un-
fastened block that had caused the rope to
reeve out

  joe monkeyface saw it watched his
friend fall slowly at first with rising speed
as he came lower and stood by in a sort
of dull horror at his own imagined help-
lessness it was a shout an oath in itself
from cardiff that aroused joe as it aroused
all hands within hail and the forecastle
bully left his place at the boat-skids bowling
over men in his way and leaped over the
ships ide with a deeper more biting curse
at his mates

  sing out sir where be ye cardiff
yelled as he rose from his icy dive

  sing out sir where be ye rumbled
back the berg in echo

  a faint answer came from the white
whirling snow wreaths and a savage de-
mand for louder guidance from cardiff
then arose a bestial snarling scream as
joe monkeyface realized that he was per-
mitting another man and such a man as
cardiff to help the one man who had
steadily remained his friend

  come back cardiff come back and
let me he screamed and plunged head-
long into the unknown terrors of that white
sea as the ice gave back his cry in his teeth

  there came a terrific roar from the berg
as another part of it toppled then the
main mass rocked on unstable base rolled
deeply and subsided into another floating
shape joe monkeyface swimming franti-
cally heard the shouting from the ship as
the swamping sea was hurled against her
by the plunging ice

  he heard faintly cardiffs lusty curse
blaspheming for some injury heard still
fainter an answering cry that must have
come from the second mate then abruptly
still blindly swept around a corner of ice
into a tiny bay in which the sea was at rest

  all sounds of the ship were hushed now
his own shivering yell came back upon him
in countless voices but the voice of mr
earl he heard more clearly as he clawed his
way painfully up on to a ledgeof cold solidity
and lay panting with weariness and fear

  joe heard voices but chattering teeth
and utterly beaten body forebade him to
answer then he must have swooned

  the icy chill and some deep animal in-
stinct of self-preservation awoke him quickly
and he groped against a numbing sense of
being utterly lost in a white world then
the snow stopped leaving walls of ghostly
green and a floor of sighing black water
overhead high overhead hung a star-
studded canopy of black over which a small
puff of fleecy cloud drifted languorously

  the crest of the berg seemed to move
gently against the slow-moving clouds then
the moon sailed into the space overhead
and illumined the vast ice cavern in which
joe was cast into the semblance of a
sublime cathedral with the organ of old
neptune himself playing a soft anthem of
lapping seas only to have the anthem put
out of tune by the discordant skra-aw-awk
of a wheeling mollymawk

  but joe was concerned more nearly with
the sight of two black specks clinging pre-
cariously to a finger-breadth ledge of ice on
the opposite side of the ice harbor the
space was a full fifty yards across yet he
could hear the labored breathing of cardiff
as he fought stubbornly to haul mr earl
out of the sea far enough for him to get a
finger-grip to support himself as for the
second mate he appeared to be either dead
or entirely helpless for he hung a dead
weight in cardiffs grip making no effort to
assist his rescuer

  joe uttered a rasping howl of encourage-
ment and plunged once more into the freez-
ing water he had seen from the better
side of the hollow space that no real hand-
hold or foothold of any kind was to be had
except where he had been cast himself as
he trudgeoned across he uttered whistling
cries of apprehension that were made
strange to absurdity by the chattering of
his teeth and his frenzied fears for his
friend then he saw cardiff suddenly pitch
forward and go down to the drag of the
unconscious officer

  mouthing as a dumb man mouths joe
reached the other side of the ice harbor and
grappled for a hold upon the disappearing
men cardiffs last expiring hold fastened
on joe and together the three went down-
down-down until joes lungs seemed to
explode and he fought fiercely to rise but
never let go his grip upon the jacket he had
first touched

  it seemed to be a full hour before his
bursting lungs inhaled the delicious cold
air then joe found that he had borne
joe monkeyface



upward into the starlight both cardiff and
mr earl without a thought save to get
them out of the numbing sea joe monkey-
face painfully towed them over to the side
where they might find secure footing

  alone and not too greatly alive himself
after endless toil and heartbreaking failures
the lad managed to haul both men up to
safety then in the clearest rays of the
moon in a hush that could almost be felt
he listened at each breast for trace of life

  cardiff was dead he had carried on as
a bold man must until his great bullying
heart broke and the man he would have
rescued had pulled him unconsciously from
his pitiful hold and drowned him but mr
earl breathed miraculously and joe mon-
keyface sprang up shuffled clumsily with
half-frozen feet and uttered a piercing shriek
of triumph that echoed and reechoed among
the glittering spires of the icy cathedral like
a hundred voices in chorus

  through the rest of the night only a
few hours joe worked as man never worked
before over a man so far gone as mr earl
was crude though his knowledge was joe
believed in warmth and his efforts were
directed toward putting animation into the
still limbs he toiled at arms legs and
then chest and stomach were in turn
thumped and kneaded worked frenziedly
under the glittering eyes of half-frantic joe
monkeyface

  and just at dawn to save himself from
falling from exhaustion joe stood up and
yelled defiance to the rising sun dancing
madly uncouthly - to restore his waning
circulation as well as to announce to the
world that he had seen a flicker in his
friends eyelids 

  then the sun came up shining through a
narrow pass from the eastward ocean warm-
ing gradually the piercing chill and bringing
to the castaway the knowledge that to live
he must eat or at least drink he propped
mr earl up with his own coat and staggered
down to the pass seeking for anything but
knowing of nothing he might expect to find
in such a place

  as he reached one horn of the narrow
pass he saw a tiny trickle of water coming
down from some high pinnacle that had been
touched earlier by the rising sun and

scooped up a poor half-pint in his cap mr
earl drank half of it thirstily and smiled
without mirth as he handed the rest back

  joe he said faintly youre got your-
self into a fine mess havent you you
ought to have stayed with the ship

  id ha drowned anyhow sir grinned
joe shivering violently

  i dont think the ship would sink joe
shes strong and she has a stout forward
bulkhead in any case youll starve here
and freeze to death help me up lad and
well see where and how we stand

  joe guessed that any man who needed
help to get up could scarcely stand at all
and said so bluntly as he started off to try
to find a way up or around those glittering
cliffs

  take my knife then said mr earl
might come across a seal or a bear

  joe clambered away out of sight and
after a cruel hours climb staggered out
upon a platform immediately above and in
sight of the second mate he also found
himself in full view of the great ocean and
mr earl startled by his hoarse exultant
shout stared up to see a queer figure dancing
like a madman flinging its arms grotesquely
and yelling at the top of lusty lungs

  a quarter of a mile away lay the miltiades
a trifle low by the head truly but afloat
and hove-to under short sail not fifty yards
from the berg a boat pulled slowly along
every man in her scanning the ice for a
break at joes shout they headed into
the little ice harbor on the shores of which
mr earl lay in sorry straits while joe
scampered down at peril of his neck to
slobber and croon inarticulate sounds that
were meant to convey to his friend the glad
news that he was saved

on the poop of the miltiades
captain deshay looked long and
earnestly through a powerful tele-
scope at the capering figure of joe on the
ice ledge when joe vanished from sight
the captain handed the glass to an ap-
prentice with a quiet smile

  have to find another name for joe
he murmured scupper me if a monkey
ever had such an expression of hulla-
balloojick joy on his face as that

mr short-hand con-
way was the possessor of a
beautiful grouch and it must
be added that he was in an
arizona jail that was far from beautiful
it was the monotony of confinement that
jarred upon mr conway not the jails lack
of beaut and what the jail lacked in
beauty it more than made up in the strength
of steel and concrete

  the jailer also had a grouch the said
state of mind being occasioned by the fact
that he had been foolish enough to while
away the time by playing stud poker
through the cell bars with mr conway
the latter at the beginning of this game
had been able to clink four silver dollars
as his total capital now he had a clink and
a crackle to the tune of ninety-eight units of
the root of evil the jailer was broke and
this fact was mr conways one bit of joy

  despite his ability and luck in the game
sometimes known as five-card insomnia
mr conways nickname had nothing to do
with cards some years before in a free-
for-all round of gun-play south of the bor-
der the forefinger of his right hand had been
shot away three-finger was too com-
mon a cognomen therefore some one had
invented a new one short-hand and the
name had stuck

  and with his trigger finger gone the way
of all flesh mr conway had been forced to
develop another style of handling a colt
with a file he had removed certain parts of
the mechanism from his old single-action
 and with constant practise had devel-
oped an almost uncanny skill in thumbing
the hammer

  but times had changed the day of the
gunman was passing and when in town mr
conway had made concession to the con-
ventionalities by carrying his colt inside
his belt tucked between his trousers and
shirt with the bottom of his vest concealing
the butt of the weapon there had been
method and safety-first in this conceal-
ment a decade-old grudge had still re-
mained unsettled between mr conway and
a fire-eating gunman known as slaughter-
house flanagan

  mr conway now in his late fifties had
fallen into certain settled habits of which
one in particular is worthy of being set
down each monday he would partake of
one lone drink of whisky on tuesdays he
would indulge in two wednesday was
worthy of three thursday called for four
friday was the day of five drinks and sat-
urday was celebrated by an even half-
dozen sunday was the day of drought-
and a belligerent state of mind

  and it had been on a sunday that he had
ridden into dos pinos and for the first time
in ten years had chanced to meet with
slaughterhouse flanagan who was the
cock-o-the-walk in the town being the pet
gunman of certain influential county poli-
ticians flanagan had failed to recognize
his ancient enemy-a fatal error sunday
in dos pinos was invariably a slow day and
mr flanagan had attempted to speed it up
by taking advantage of mr conways mild
and inoffensive appearance

  mr conways reply had been short
extremely profane and highly insulting
thereupon mr flanagan had rashly
reached for his colt his hand had closed

simultaneously upon the butt of the gun
and sudden death for mr conways old
 had been the first to bark

  following this episode with full and mis-
placed confidence that the ethics of the
country would result in his swift acquittal
on the ground of self-defense mr conway
had surrendered himself

  too late he had realized that he was de-
cidedly in wrong times had indeed
changed having incurred the enmity of
the political powers he would stand no
chance at all of a fair trial he was a poor
trout who had swallowed the hook and the
zealous district attorney was the skilled
fisherman who would reel him in

  but mr conway at birth had been en-
dowed with a large amount of irish wit
which a couple of scores of years of precari-
ous and sometimes doubtful living as a gun-
man had supplemented with a large amount
of guile at one time he had made the
statement that brains would do more than
dynamite to get a man out of jail and
right now he had a grand chance to try out
the brains

  the jailer was a nervous man and of this
mr conway brutally took advantage for
two days he threatened to commit suicide
deliberately as long as the prison official
would listen he verbally drew gruesome
pictures of himself with his throat cut from
ear to ear he succeeded in getting the
jailers goat so much so that the official
refused to allow his morbid captive the use
of a knife or a fork mr conway was forced
to eat with a pewter spoon and even this
was taken away from him after each meal

  the third day was sunday and sunday
in the dos pinos jail was the day of corn-
starch pudding for dessert corn-starch
was one of mr conways pet abominations
but this time he had use for it he lathered
his face with pudding and sprinkled this
with dust gathered from the corners of his
cell his large bandanna provided the
needed loop with a short knot at the
ends he tied the cloth over one of the bars
that formed part of the grilled ceiling

  the jailers footstep in the corridor was
the signal for mr conway to stand erect on
his bunk slip his head through the loop of
the bandanna and crook his knees the
jailer missing mr conways usual gibing
invitation for another poker game stopped
and peered through the bars

  he gasped in horror mr conway appar-

ently had carried out his threat of suicide
by hanging himself with hasty fumbling
fingers the official unlocked and entered the
cell a closer look in the dim light at the
corn-starch-and-dust-plastered face of his
prisoner proved all too convincing

  hastily backing out of the cell he started
as a matter of habit to lock the door but
why lock up a dead man the keys slipped
from his nervous fingers he snatched
them up and fled toward the front of the
building a moment later sounded the slam
of the outer door the jailer was scurry-
ing toward the coroners office half a mile
distant

  by the time he had returned with the
official investigator of deaths mr conway
having regained his horse his winchester
and his colt and carrying a huge grin was
two miles out of town and going strong
toward the colorado river

no sir-ree said the rancher
fifty bucks is my price and its
worth it you aint payin me a
cent to keep my mouth shut understand
but my skiff leaks-some-and that makes
it a gamble worth the money-to me just
take a look at that river

  mr conway looked then glanced appre-
hensively back across the desert hills to the
eastward again his gaze turned to the
three-quarter-mile-wide swirling surging
yellow flood-waters of the colorado mr
conway was no navigator the stretch of
eddying water made him feel helpless

  heres your fifty-if we can start now

  sure we can put your stuff in the
boat

  mr conway hastened to unsaddle his
horse and place the saddle blankets and
rifle in the fragile twelve-foot skiff there
was some slight difficulty in getting the
horse to take to the water the rancher
finally dragged him in and fastened the
end of the reins to a nail in the stern of the
boat then with the horse swimming be-
hind and towed by the reins they started
for california the rancher at the oars and
mr conway busy with an empty tomato-
can bailing to keep the skiff afloat

  half-way across the strain on the reins
bent the nail the horse freed from the
boat started back for the arizona shore
catching him was no easy task for the
animal turned away each time the rancher
maneuvered the craft into a position for


adventure

mr conway to grab the bridle at last
the rancher cut off the painter mr con-
way used this as a riata and roped the swim-
ming horse just in time too for the frantic
animal was within fifty feet of the shore

  the leaky skiff was now half-filled with
water mr conway tied the loose end of
the painter around his waist and began
setting a record for fast bailing with a toma-
to-can

  in a thicket of willows four miles below
the starting-point the skiff literally bumped
into california with solid land again be-
neath his boots mr conway pulled out his
bandanna and mopped the sweat of appre-
hension from his face he had been scared
and he admitted it

  say you sure earned your coin he
said but whos gonna bail the water out
goin back

  golly i never thought of that

  the ranchers face was a study in emo-
tion

  mr conway grinned saddled up and rode
away to the westward leaving the rancher
scratching his head over the problem

  twenty-four hours later mr conway
cocked an eye aloft at the desert sun and
decided that it was time to eat but eats
were not to be obtained for his horse lay
dead some six miles distant back toward
the colorado the skittish animal had
possessed one aversion namely horned
toads when during the night before one
of the harmless little creatures had crossed
his path the horse had shied and leaped to
one side this side leap on rocky ground
had caused a bad fall one hoof had wedged
between two rocks and the fall had snapped
a foreleg and to make it worse the horse
had fallen upon and smashed flat the can-
teen that mr conway had purchased from
the friendly rancher

  the sight of the smashed canteen had had
the effect of increasing mr conways thirst
therefore at daybreak after shooting the
horse he had set out in search of a spring
known to desert travelers as the frog
hole he had found the water such as it
was but now regretted his lack of foresight
in neglecting to take with him the scanty
rations that were in a gunnysack tied to the
saddle six miles back to the horse and
six miles on the return journey to the spring
would mean twelve miles without water
mr conway decided to wait until the heat
of the day had abated

  he gazed around and spat in disgust as
his eye met nothing but an arid sun-baked
waste of sand and fantastic rock formation

  so this is california land of milk honey
and lots of money oh well it might be
worse he cogitated then centered his
mind on a nice problem namely would
the pangs of hunger eventually prove
sharper than the ache of blistered feet
the answer can not be set in type

  morosely he surveyed the mangy purple
heights of the wolftooth mountains which
lay thirty miles distant across a burning
heat-eddying desert caldron in the canons
of the wolftooths lay safety and-cold
water no california officer would be
likely to look for him there in the event that
the arizona authorities had telegraphed the
information that the much wanted short-
hand conway had succeeded in crossing
the colorado

  mr conway retraced his steps to the
water-hole drank a little of the nauseatingly
warm stagnant fluid then pulled out a limp
muslin bag and nursed the last few tobacco
crumbs into a very slender cigaret

  golly he cogitated gazing distastefully
at the spot where the water slowly oozed
from some subterranean source that stuff
runs about two per cent pure niter well
it aint gonna hurt me-much and its
wet anyway

  again he cursed the tragic mishap of the
smashed canteen a scurvy trick of fate
which had effectually marooned him on this
small island of dampness in the midst of
a sea of eddying heat-waves which stretched
to the limit of vision and turned into life-
and-hope-stealing illusions and mirages

  with no food and no tobacco to comfort
him in the course of another hour the heat
and a few pestiferous flies had succeeded
thoroughly in souring whatever milk of
human kindness remained in his system
any man on horseback who approached the
water-hole was due to bump into some con-
centrated hard luck-for himself

  another hour passed and mr conways
frame of mind had curdled still more when
far out on the shimmering desert a cloud of
dust caught his apathetic gaze a little
later the cloud resolved itself into a horse-
man driving two pack-animals

  hope has set records for high jumping
but mr conways breast stirred but little
where a couple of hours back he might
unhesitatingly have committed even murder
reverse irish

to get out of his desperate position now
he was inclined to moderation he had
been given time to think so far he had
committed no offense against the law in
california and the latter state was a
sanctuary which he now had no desire to
violate therefore he put on a deep-sea
thinking act

  finally he grinned and began hastilyto
pile up small boulders his final work of
preparation was to fish up the stub of a pen-
cil and upon a cigaret paper write some
cryptic words and figures

  his labors finished mr conway grinned
again wickedly this time as he gazed toward
the approaching rider now less than half
a mile distant hope was leaping high but
mr conway was lying low-behind a large
rock

  a few minutes later he arose abruptly
menacingly in his hand was the old colt 
better git he warned the horseman
its open season for claim-jumpers

  the newcomer turned for a hostile-eyed
glare at the interrupter of passage to the
water-hole his hand stole toward the
holster low on his thigh

  stick em up peremptorily barked mr
conway reach for heaven or youll head
the other way

  with commendable promptness the horse-
man raised his hands he looked into mr
conways mild and sad blue eyes and his
features relaxed

  reglar desert wolf aint you he
grinned whats the game

  he noted mr conways position the pos-
ture of a skilled gunman a snap shot he
saw the hammer drawn-back beneath a not
too tensed thumb by that he knew that
the trigger evidently had been filed from the
gun experience told him that here was
a man with whom it would be dangerous
to trifle but he grinned again

  the idea explained mr conway sadly
is that im only protecting my rights
youre on my mining claim shes all
staked out legal see that monument my
location notice is in it

he pointed to a small mound of boulders
mining claim-rats snorted the other
you know danged well that they aint no
minerals here and you cant stake off the
frog hole

  cant i

  a note of truculence entered mr con-
ways ordinarily mild voice

  try to stop me he invited

  im no claim-jumper denied the other
and you mustached old walrus you
danged well know it i just want to water
my cayuses

  mr conway highly resented being termed
an old walrus having seen a picture of one
he didnt mind the mustached part of it
for that was true

  not a chance that there waters on my
claim and i aint gonna let any spavined
bronks muddy it all up for me if you want
water youll have to buy it and waters
gone up

  buy it why you saffron-tinged mis-
shapen ornary hunk of misinterpretation
orated the horseman

  these are not his exact words but the
tune has not been changed

  you sheep-herding fish-brained cande-
labra-faced worse-than-forgotten imitation
of a sleepless night do you mean to say
that youre trying to keep a man away from
a water-hole-out here

  mr conway paled and weakened the
epithets stung-they were fighting words-
but full well he realized that he deserved
them

  son youre there i guess its a gift
he paid grudging admiration to the
others vocabulary

  i was figuring on swapping my claim
and the water-hole for one of your bronks
but im willing to listen to reason i
only-

  blast your nervy old hide was the
interruption reason huh listen and
youll hear it-as soon as i think up a few
more things to call you now whats the
idea of staking off the frog hole

  the idea explained mr conway sadly
is that im plumb hung up here i need
a cayuse or a canteen or both im not
stickin you up to git them understand
i know my rights and im keepin you cov-
ered because youre trespassin i aint
takin no chances on having my claim
jumped so just drop your six-gun into the
dust to use more than one thumb and
one finger will be a sure way of providing me
with more hosses than i need dont take
any chances son i can let daylight through
you before you can bat an eye

  the affair so far had not gone quite to
mr conways liking he knew the horse-
man could be more deadly than a rattle-
snake the stranger was in his early


adventure

thirties but his face even when he flashed
his ready grin was hard and his eyes now
were harder than onyx and as dark but it
was his nonchalance that was disconcerting

  im willing to oblige he drawlingly
replied but i sure hate to get the gun
jammed full of sand come and get it or
let me hand it to you

  mr conways eyes flicked several times
this was better inwardly he began to
grin he would let the other man see just
how far his contemplated trick would go
with an old gunman

huh he grunted you aint
lackin any sand thats a hog-tied
cinch admiringly reckon ill
have to humor you till we get better ac-
quainted give me the gun

  he stepped forward

  the other gingerly pulled out his colt
flipped it in the air and caught it by the
barrel but as he caught it mr conways
gun poked him in the ribs mr conways
left hand reached up and took the weapon
butt first as it was extended to him

  by a forced smile the horseman gamely
acknowledged defeat mr conway flipped
out the cylinder ejected the shells then
returned the weapon

  put it back in the holster and try it over
again he invited

  the other man rather sheepishly hol-
stered the colt

 say he blurted out how many
notches on your gun

 too many confessed mr conway
lets see you roll it

  here goes i guess ill look like an
amateur to an old-timer like you

  the stranger started to hand his colt
butt foremost to his captor mr conway
reached tentatively

  like a flash in a bare fraction of a second
the gun reversed and snapped

  fast-fast was the compliment son
youve sure wasted your youth in practising
that it aint worth while any more

  mr conway walked around to the other
side of the horse again pressed his colt
against the others ribs and pulled a -
carbine from the saddle scabbard

  now son im gonnajmake you a propo-
sition for water out of your canteen and
a ride on a pack-hoss your bronks can use
my private water-hole

 as mr conway glanced toward the

spring his jaw dropped in chagrin the
pack animals unwatched by him had stolen
a march they were now drinking from the
water-hole

  blisterin heck he ejaculated in dis-
gust that scheme is two-thirds shot full
of holes

  he sized up the pack-horses one of
them a sorrel was long-legged rangy in
build with knowing eye its points were
sized up

  how much do you want for the sorrel
bone-yard id like to buy him if the price
aint too steep

 buy him youre sure an uncertain
hombre first you hold me up then you
want to buy a horse

  hold up nothin disavowed mr con-
way i told you i was only makin sure
that you want gonna jump my claim
how much for the sorrel

  i might sell him for sixty-some day
but i need him right now got to rush that
stuff into the wolftooth country im
wonderin why you dont steal one of the
horses

  i never was a hoss-thief was the retort
and they aint no warrants out agin me
in california so i aint gonna borrow trou-
ble-unless i just gotta do it to git away
from here

  again the rider flashed his ready grin
all the while he had been subjecting mr
conway to minute scrutiny he had noted
the missing trigger finger

  shot off he inquired casually his gaze
on the gun hand

  maybe grunted mr conway puzzled
sensing that the question was more than
casual

  three years ago-below the border
followed another query

  maybe it did-and then again maybe
it did

  the others smile turned quizzical

  you seem to fit the description of
short-hand conway

  that so

  all right laughed the other im
glad you admit it so freely that time you
stepped in and saved whitey dunnigan
from being turned into mince-meat by-

 aw shucks five mexes want so
much growled the embarrassed mr con-
way

  one of them got your trigger meat-hook
anyway you see ive sort of been classing
reverse irish

you as a guy id be willing to do a good turn
for whitey was my pal

  youve got me pegged right im con-
way but who in heck are you

  carroll-bob carroll is the stick-up
thing still on or do i get my guns back
im sorry i called you those names

  dont let that worry you ill save them
up and use them on somebody else about
the guns-bob carroll doesnt spell any-
thing to me never heard of you before-
under that name aw heck sure you can
have the guns back it wouldnt do you
any good to smoke me up-or try to

  and calling it a stick-up is all wrong
i was only protecting my claim from being
jumped get that right

  have it your own way laughed car-
roll you were trying to jump the price of
water too but i wont hold that against
you-seeing that things are as they are

  i only tried to boost it was the con-
tention and it didnt work out worth the
feathers on a lizard

  carroll dismounted shook hands with
conway and regained his weapons he
started to lead his saddle-horse toward the
water-hole

  say got any tobacco to spare

  carroll turned to answer the question
sure lots of it go and get a can out
of a saddle-bag

  mr conway started toward the pack-
animals he stopped and inquired-
which hoss

  the sorrel i think both cayuses have
light loads sos i could make fast time

  on each pack-saddle were hung rawhide
bags each slightly smaller in dimensions
than a keroene-case holding two five-gallon
cans the dry hide was as stiff as boards
the edges of the bags were square like boxes
the bags were open at the top but small
tarpaulins covered both saddles and their
loads

  mr conway removed the tarpaulin from
the sorrel and from one bag dragged out
three sides of bacon a ten-pound sack of
flour and a cloth bag filled with dried beans
this uncovered the bottom layer no
tobacco was revealed but the other con-
tents served to arouse and hold the search-
ers interest there was a layer of card-
board boxes each containing twenty rifle
cartridges and the boxes numbered at
least fifteen

  carroll looked up from the water-hole

    guess the tobaccos on the other side

	he announced

   after replacing the provisions in the
 saddle-bag mr conway ducked around to
 the other side of the horse this time he
 discovered the tobacco tins a dozen of them
 and then dug further to verify his suspicions
 as to the bottom layer in the second bag
 it was composed of even more cartridge
 boxes than the other the horse carried at
 least seven hundred rounds of ammunition

   among other things mr conway pos-
 sessed a responsive imagination seven
 hundred rifle cartridges and perhaps
 there were as many more on the other pack-
 horse that meant action-somewhere
 a private war undoubtedly he imagined
 he felt an itch in the spot where once his
 hand had been normal in the possession of
 a nervous trigger finger

   mr conway sighed bestirred himself
 gathering fuel and started a fire presently
 the two men squatted down to a menu of
 bacon fried biscuits and coffee the horses
 grazed near by on cacti

   luther burbank is famed among other
 achievements for having rendered cactus
 available for fodder by removing the spines
 he used science mr conway obtained the
 same result with a hatchet

    mr carroll rolled another cigaret lighted
  itby borrowing mr conways glowing stub
  then leaned back into the scanty shade of
  a yucca

    you particularly stressed the fact that
 there are no warrants out against you in
 california he began not to get per-
 sonal-you dont have to answer-are you
 on the dodge from arizona or nevada

   maybe

   mr conway grew wary-eyed and unob-
 trusively moved his leg to bring his holster
 into a handier position

    well old-timer its all right with me
 i might be able to help you

    ill admit theres no warrants out agin
  me in california which aint what you
  might call an incriminatin admission and
  i want things to stay that way thats why
  i didnt hold you up

    i aint takin any chances im gittin
 along in years and i crave a little peace for
 a change i want to settle down quietly-
 and i dont want to do it in the pen 

    there was a decided gleam of interest in
 carrolls eyes followed by the birth of an idea
 that caused him to cough-or something
adventure

  so you want to settle down eh you
seem to be the kind of an hombre i can help
along so why not shoot the whole story

  not much of a yarn im in wrong with
the bunch of side-windin politicians across
the creek because i just naturally had to
bump off their hired gunman thats all

i might mention that i ran a whopper of
a rannygazoo on the jailer and made a dean
getaway

  so thats it mused mr carroll aloud
i was wondering why you were on the
dodge any more warrants out

  mr conway pondered now that he had
admitted this much there would be no harm
in telling more carroll seemed friendly
he coughed deprecatingly

  oh theres seven or eight or mebbe ten
old ones that had been pigeonholed those
scavengin politicians dug them up they
wanted to get enough on me to make it
a life term and then hang me to make it
certain

  younffn bad old-timer but youre safe
enough with me-as long as i havent
a warrant

  what say who in heck are you-
what are you tensely

  me oh im a deputy sheriff

  mr carrolls tone was light in his eyes
was a laugh

  almost faster than the eye could follow
as swift as the strike of a snake mr con-
ways gun had flashed into view the ham-
mer drawn back beneath his thumb the
muzzle pointed skyward ready to pull
down

  easy old-timer drawled carroll non-
chalantly licking the cigaret he had started
to roll i know almost your whole history
whitey dunnigan told it to me to put it
bluntly youre almost pathetic in your de-
sire to stay on the right side of the law -
now as you put it youre getting along in
years im for you and can use you this
end of the county needs you

  mr conway looked into the others eyes
looked long and searchingly and was
baffled slowly he replaced the colt

  and youre a depity he breathed
workin at it

  i sure am

  he jerked a thumb toward the pack
horses

  those supplies are for sheriff summers
posse carroll went on ever hear of the
 yucca kid

   yes ive heard of him heavily

 	friend of yours asked the deputy
 casually

   i aint ever met up with him and i
 aint hankerin to hes got the name of
 bein too smooth-as slippery as a fresh-
 peeled tree and a double-crosser of his pals
 if it will pay him

   yeh i guess his pals know that and
 watch him to protect themselves

   where does he figger in this deal

  weve got him cornered in a blind
 canon

  u-u-mm that explains the load of
 shells

   well likely need all of them weve
 managed to kill off four of his gang but the
 kid and his pal are holding out seeing
 that youre so anxious to keep a lily-white
 reputation in california you might horn in
 and help us get them summers will be glad
 to swear you in as a deputy three dollars
 a day a horse bacon beans and ammuni-
 tion is better than being stranded here

   youre darned tootin it is ill just
 amble along and sit in the game we can
 load all the stuff on the other hoss and i can
 ride the sorrel bareback whats the lay-
 out

   it started with the lost florenden mine
 ever hear of it no well some years
 ago old man florenden blew into needles
 with some specimens of gold ore rich enough
 to make you blink but he was plumb
 batty-reckon the sun had got him and he
 couldnt remember the location of the claim
 he had staked there was quite a flurry in
 san berdoo prospecting circles as you might

 put it and-knows how many parties

 have tried to find the rich strike none of
 them did

   the old man finally recovers his mind
 but hes been too ailing to take another
 desert trip his family in san berdoo have
 been nursing him for years before he died
 last month he drew a map absolutely locat-
 ing the lost mine his son harry grew up
 in the mean time and he was to set out
 and recoup the family fortunes

  the boy figures on starting from
 needles he gets on the train with his out-
 fit but the night before hes ready to start
 he takes a few drinks and talks too much
 the yucca kid bumped him off and stole
 the map a flock of witnesses saw the
 killing and when the news was wired to
 san berdoo summers loads his posse and
reverse irish

horses into a baggage-car and santa fes in
a hurry to needles from there we trailed
the kid and bottled him up

  now weve got to play a waiting game
its sure death to go after him he and
his partner can make a winchester speak
any language one of our deputies ike
flint got potted at three hundred yards
with nothing but his forehead showing above
a rock-a plumb center shot summers will
be glad to swear you in in ikes place
were going to stay on the job till we
finish it thats why i went into needles for
supplies

  mr conway reviewed the situation he
liked it

  and if i git depitized by summers and
make good thatll kinda establish my stand-
ing on this side of the colorado hey

  sure as shooting summers is square
if he takes you on hell have a convenient
lapse of memory if any warrants float across
from arizona its your chance to get
a fresh start

  for a time there was silence mr con-
way finally squinted at the sun they were
waiting to cross the blistering thirty-mile
stretch at night

  quite a spell to sundown he remarked
got a deck of cards

  sure couple of new decks i was bring-
ing to the boys how about a little game of
stud

  suits me said mr conway secretly
rejoicing

  mr carroll felt the same way having not
the slightest doubt but that within a short
time he would be able to pocket all the funds
carried by the other man it might be
mentioned that when not engaged in other
work-work involving the use of a gun and
nerve-mr carroll kept up with the over-
head by his ability to make a deck of cards
say uncle when speech was desired

  the game began with rifle cartridges for
chips at sundown mr conway possessed
over three hundred in cash three horses
their loads and equipment and about every-
thing else in sight mr carroll was the
owner of a vague suspicion the clothes he
wore and the right to talk to himself even
his six-gun now belonged to the better man
he managed to smile however even though
the smile had a southerly twist

  you sure hooked me old-timer and now
i want you to help me out summers and
the bunch will laugh themselves sick if they

find out that i got beaten at stud and lost
even the shells i was bringing in itll be

worse than that summers will raise-

with fancy trimmings

  the horses were mine and suppose you
ride the pinto till we get close to camp
then i want you to favor me by changing
off and riding the sorrel thatll let me out
see with the bunch

  youve got your own guns so you wont
have use for mine for them and the sup-
plies and the pack-horses ill be owing you
say three hundred bucks you keep the
pinto and the saddle i can tell the bunch
that i sold them to you savvy

  sure thats all right mr conway
hastened to assure him you owe me
three hundred let it go at that i dont
want to get you into trouble with the
sheriff pause lets get started

at daybreak in the foothills
of the wolftooth they stopped
long enough to boil coffee and fry
bacon then followed three hours of hard
going the trail wound up through deep
canons climbed ridges descended into
veritable mazes of gullies and climbed again
they paused to breathe the horses

  say propounded mr conway what
good is a mine up here they can never
get the machinery in and it wouldnt pay
to carry the ore out

  no that ore is so danged rich that
a burro-load will be worth fifteen hundred

or so a couple of hundred burros-

  fifteen hundred golly there might be
millions in it no wonder theres been kill-
ings over it

  and theres liable to be more of them
added carroll

  by this time they were in a canon that
showed signs of widening soon it opened
into a basin perhaps twenty acres in size
the flat was rich in grass and three horses
grazed restrained by hobbles a brilliant
ribbon of green marked the course of a
spring trickling down the hillside

  part way up the eastern slope of the basin
blazed a camp-fire two men were in sight

  better let me go on ahead suggested
carroll i want to talk summers into
taking you on

  mr conway showed alarm

  make it good and strong he begged
i sure do want to get a stand-in with the
sheriff
adventure

  leave it to me old-timer replied car-
roll

  mr conway watched him ride up the hill
and dismount near the fire one of the two
men approached pointed with an obviously
angry gesture down the hill then put his
arms akimbo and waited

  carroll began talking soon as mr con-
way watched it was evident that carrolls
talk was having effect the attitude of the
angry one relaxed

  he turned and shouted up the hill in
response to this summons three men ap-
peared at widely separated points among the
rocks on the crest all of them carried
rifles two hurried down to the fire the
third disappeared again

  followed a short conversation then car-
roll turned and beckoned mr conway
hastened up the hill forcing the sorrel in his
eagerness to get on the right side of the law

  he sized up the four strangers one in
particular the man with whom carroll had
argued was the type that mr conways
experienced eye labeled-

  deadly

  physically he was not impressive being
of medium height and build but he was
thin-faced sharp-nosed lantern-jawed his
hands betrayed restlessness mr conway
recalled another sheriff of this type the
agent of the law in a certain border county
a score of years back a man who depended
upon nervous energy and speed rather than
physical force fast as a flash on the draw
and a ruthless killer when it came to a show-
down with outlaws

  mr conway swung off his horse eyed
curiously by the members of the posse two
of whom were grinning

  sheriff this is short-hand conway
was carrolls introduction and conway
the guy with the beauty spots called freckles
is speck malone this is bill hargis
and the bird with the insipid grizzly-bear
grin is sandy bowen pinkeye sweitzer is
watching the canon youll meet him later

  after shaking hands with each in turn
mr conways gaze returned to the sheriff
he looked into close-set clear cold gray
eyes in which lay a smoldering enigmatic
light that reminded him of a pet puma he
had seen in prescott summers spoke

  bob tells me that you can beat him on
the draw and that youre the fellow who
saved whitey dunnigan down in cananea
he says hes explained the situation here to

you and hes told me of what youre up
against do you want to join us

  i sure do

  thats fine

  mr conway noted a brief flicker in the
sheriffs eyes it might have been a hint of
amusement a smile of satisfaction or a show
of liking and friendliness mr conway did
not stop to analyze for summers continued
speaking	-

  youll have your work cut out for you-
to make good with me come along and
ill show you

  mr conway followed the officer up the
hill he noted at the same time that carroll
started toward the spot where a few min-
utes before the fifth man of the posse had
disappeared among the rocks at the
summit the sheriff ducked low and sidled
up behind a rock mr conway imitated
his caution

  take a look invited summers but
dodge back quick and look again from
another place they shoot to kill-and
they make center shots if you give them
half a chance

  mr conway raised his head above the
top of the rock below him lay a small val-
ley from three to four hundred yards in
width and half a mile in length both ends
were closed by perpendicular walls the
northern one at least one hundred feet in
height the southern one perhaps forty
the eastern side was a bulk of sheer tower-
ing cliff it was apparent at a glance that
three sides of the valley offered no hope of
escape for the outlaws

  at the foot of the opposite cliff was the
mouth of a tunnel where old florenden had
blasted and burrowed as he followed a
stringer leading into the big vein of gold
rocks and earth lay heaped in a semi-circle
in front of the tunnel and from the shelter
of this debris a winchester suddenly spat
a jagged bit of stone flew up and sent mr
conways hat sailing whee-e-e sounded
the weird scream of a flattened bullet
diminuendoing westward

  mr conway dropped back to shelter

  i told you to dodge pronto summers
remarked in a matter-of-fact tone that
was poor shooting-for them must have
missed by four or five inches now you can
see what were up against weve got to
starve them out and how long thatll take
is a problem im due back in san bernar-
dino before this
reverse irish

  mr conway recovered his hat and
thoughtfully inspected the new dimple the
bit of rock had dented into the top of the
crown

  and where do i come in he inquired
right here-to speed things up theres
only one way out of the trap-the valley
here-and thats a trail about two hundred
feet to the north one of my men is watch-
ing it every minute two men watch it at
night i want a man to sneak down the
trail in the darkness hide out and wait till
daylight then he may be able to flank
those birds with rifle-fire

  but ikes death has been a lesson to us
even bob carroll draws the line at going
down into the valley down there the
birds in the tunnel will have the advantage
bob says theyve got advantage enough
now-with their accurate shooting

  huh i take it that you want me to be
the sacrifice

  not exactly that you can use your
judgment about going but if you help to
speed things up by potting those two
hombres why youll be helping yourself
ill do anything for you you can be my
head deputy if you want the job and
youll be safe as far as arizona warrants are
concerned

  safe from arizona warrants this prom-
ise was the deciding point with mr con-
way he would attempt the job at which
the deputies had balked after stealing two
more hasty looks down into the valley he
seated himself with his back against a rock
rolled a cigaret then grinned at the sheriff

  why dont you send a man around to
the top of the cliff above the tunnel or to
the head of the valley from either place
it will be easy to drop lead down behind
that dump of rocks

  havent we tried it growled summers
it would take a pair of wings to get a man
up there the head of the valley would be
the easiest a sixty-foot ladder would make
it

  all i want is about a sixty-foot rope
said mr conway im going to drop into
the valley tonight from the lower end

bib at two oclock in the morning
mr conway was in the valley
 si silently in his stocking feet he
felt his way along the base of the eastern
cliff toward the tunnel behind him a rope
of halters tied together dangled from the

lowest point on the rocks stationed at the
upper end of the rope were sheriff summers
and bob carroll three sharp jerks at the
rope was the prearranged signal for them to
pull mr conway up the face of the rocky
wall in case he wished to confer with them or
had found unfeasible his plan of single-
handed attack

  half an hour later mr conway pursuing
indian tactics had reached within twenty
feet of the tunnels mouth there flat on
his stomach in the deep shadow of the cliff
he lay listening boots had been discarded
as being out of the question the slightest
sound might draw gun-fire he had even
removed his belt lest the buckle clatter on
a rock as he crawled along a knotted bit
of rope now held up his trousers his colt
had been carried inside his shirt he had
even rolled his shirt sleeves above his elbows
for fear the faint click of a wrist button
against a rock might spoil his plan

  now the colt in his right hand with
infinite caution he drew himself ahead six
inches again he paused to listen a full
minute elapsed before he moved another
few inches he was careful about his
breathing

  exaggerated caution no within a few
feet on the other side of the dump lay an
armed and -desperate man an occasional
body movement a faint swish of cloth on
dirt enabled mr conway to locate the po-
sition of the man on guard

  the very silence of the mountain night
rendered more difficult mr conways task
the faint faint yapping of a distant coyote
and the occasional call of a night bird were
the only sounds

  his fingers settled on a tiny pebble he
drew back his right arm his shoulder
joint creaked alarmingly momentarily he
held his breath then with a full-arm
swing he threw the stone it clattered on
the ground a score of feet on the far side of
the dump

  a quick rustle and then silence on the
part of the watcher betrayed alarm came
the soft click of a rifle being cocked

  mr conway flung another pebble then
cautiously arose to a crouching position
he saw the guard a vague blur in the dark-
ness less than ten feet away his eyes and
faculties evidently concentrated in the
opposite direction

  two quick steps to the top of the dump
then a rock rolled from beneath mr


adventure

conways foot it was no time for inde-
cision nor was there time for thought

  mr conway acted on instinct he leaped
as the guard turned the butt of his colt
crashed on the others skull

  his left hand encountered the rifle he
seized it the guards knees were bending
he slumped to the ground

  the light snores of the sleeper within the
tunnel had ceased abruptly mr conway
stepped in haste to one side of the tunnels
mouth and stuck out his foot as the second
man rifle in hand came running into the
open the runner fell sprawling his rifle
clattered on to the dump before he could
arise mr conway had straddled the small
of his back the muzzle of the old  was
pressed hard behind the ear of the prostrate
man

  lay still youre under arrest an-
nounced mr conway

  under arrest spluttered the other
which one of us is crazy why dont you
shoot and be done with it

  sure youre under arrest

  mr conways tone was almost gay now
that he had pulled off the coup that would
put him strongly into the good graces of
the sheriff

  the- am who in blazes are you

  im one of summers depities

  mr conway cast a wary glance toward
the prostrate form of the man he had first
struqk down

 the-you are why you-

  the rest of the peroration was unneces-
sarily profane but in it mr conway caught
an unmistakable ring of sincerity and was
puzzled

  which one of yous the yucca kid he
inquired rather aimlessly

  something seemed to be wrong

  the yucca kid you certainly are
crazy im sheriff summers

  sure sure said mr conway sooth-
ingly and im alexander the great

  he looked toward the western side of the
valley opened his mouth to utter the cow-
boy yell that would bring four deputies to
his assistance then suddenly hesitated and
silently exhaled the full breath he had drawn
for the shout he had been struck by what he

would have termed a-of a big hunch

  little oddities in the manners of the men
with whom he had leagued and slight dis-
crepancies in their stories suddenly loomed
big he was glad he had not yelled it

might be better to investigate a little his
hunch was very strong

  looky here he said prodding his cap-
tive you say youre the sheriff can you
prove it

  of course i can let me up my badge
is on my vest in my pocket ive got the
remains of the warrants for the yucca kid
and half a dozen john does

  mr conway did not allow the other man
to arise mechanically he kept the gun
muzzle against his head and continued to
sit astride him

  aint you one of the kids men
finally inquired the other a new note in the
voice that a few moments before had been
grating desperate

  -- no i was sworn in on the posse
to get the kid

  youre either a-fool or a stranger-

perhaps both said the sheriff were you
to get a reward if you got us

  i sure was-a big one

  youd have got it in the shape of a bul-
let in the back the kid has been up to his
old tricks hes got a brain and almost as
big a queer sense of humor as bob carroll
did you meet bob

  hes the one who rung me in on the
posse

  and hes also the nerviest dirtiest cold-
bloodedest fox in seven states hes more
than a match for the yucca kid im sher-
iff summers all right let me get up and
prove it

  describe the yucca kid

hes lean hatchet-faced and cold-eyed
correct ill let you up but its the
kid himself who saved you if i hadnt
thought of a few things i would have yelled
for help the moment i had you down

  he told me to shoot both of you and
take no chances he sat all over any possi-
bility of taking you alive that didnt ring
quite right for a sheriff i had thought it
queer that none of the posse showed tin-
ware-stars or badges and they all
watched me like hawks

  besides that i didnt exactly like their
drawing aside every once in a while for
whispered talks and a couple of them
couldnt keep their faces straight i know
why now they certainly had one rich joke

-them

  the sheriff had turned over to a sitting
position mr conway was on his knees
still keeping his gun on the other man
reverse irish

  that colt seems to doubt me heres
my badge

  mr conway felt of it in the darkness
seems all right now if youre the
sheriff tell me how you got cornered
like a bunch of calves when i heard
that six men were out with the kid i gath-
ered a posse of five they were picked
shots and the only available men of the
type i wanted

  we trailed the kids gang in here-two
days behind them then we lost the trail
among the rocks on top of the ridge the one
right across the valley we sighted the
tunnel and guessed it to be florendens
mine so we all rode down florendens
trail into the valley-to investigate

  the kids gang came out of conceal-
ment in the rocks above and opened fire
we didnt have a chance bud hopkins
and me managed to reach the tunnel and
weve held out since

  the gang shot down four of us and
from inside the tunnel we watched them
pumping more lead into the bodies then
they started shooting our horses thats
when i potted one of them

  ike flint supplied mr conway

  so ike was one of them too bad
well the kids been trying to get us ever
since hes got to get us to protect himself
after the butchery of four deputies say
wheres bud

  right there hell come around all
right i cracked him with my gun-butt
and i didnt hit hard enough to kill him
he had his hat on and the thick felt pro-
tected him to a certain extent so dont
worry

  howd you happen to join up with the
kid queried summers kneeling to ascer-
tain the size of the bump on hopkins head

  golly sheriff thats what i want to tell
you i was tryin to serve the law

  say who in sky-blue-pink blazes threw
the cliff at me suddenly demanded hop-
kins in a rather shaky voice

  there you are sheriff uttered mr
conway in relief i told you hed come
around he wouldnt swear like that if he
was gonna die

  youre blankety right im not dead
yet oo-oh my head groaned mr hop-
kins sitting up what happened is it
still tonight or some other time how long
have i been here

  then he caught sight of mr conway

 gosh call weve got company whos
 the gent

 search me he knocked you cold and
 then got me dead to rights outside of
 that he seems to like us

 im michael conway - short - hand
 conway was the volunteered information

 the dickens you are summers blurted
 out in surprize ive heard of you aint
 you kinda strayed off your range

 some was the admission and im
 gonna stay off

 thereupon mr conway proceeded to
 sketch the events leading up to his attempt-
 ed use as a cats paw by the outlaws and
 here we are he finished

 for several moments there was silence
 broken at last by mr hopkins

 well ill be - was his weighty

 utterance

 you covered the ground there bud
 declared summers the same goes for me
 aint it a lulu of a yarn

 yarn

 mr conway was indignant

 its the gospel truth ive shot square
 with you sheriff-jail-break and all
 jail-break

 summers choked slightly

 that wasnt a jail-break its the fun-
 niest thing ive heard this year

 now looky here sheriff i went into
 this thing because i wanted to be a law-
 abidin citizen-in california i was seri-
 ous it meant so-much to me and i

 let a gang of coyotes pull an awful whizzer
 on me im sore-clean through im

 gonna get back at them-plenty to-

 with immunity this is a personal matter
 now so long

 mr conway started to climb over the
 dump a seething boiling vessel of wrath
 then he stopped

 say you fellows take off your boots and
 sneak along the cliff till you come to a rope
 its down at the lowest rocks wait there
 dont make a sound this is gonna be
 good the first guy to come down the rope
 will be the yucca kid and i wont send
 a blue-print along with him either use
 your own judgment

 hopkins chuckled despite his throbbing
 head

 you wont have to send a blue-print
 was summers dry assurance but sup-
 pose theyve heard us talking

 they wont weve been darned low
 

adventure

and earnest and ive got the out that it
was the two of you talkin they couldnt
have heard the words-if they heard any-
thing at all

pselft mr conway disappeared in the
wi darkness

        five minutes later he jerked
three times at the rope and was pulled up
the cliff

  what in-is the matter with you

demanded the kid cold feet

  no its a cinch  crawled right up to
the dump and listened to them talk but
it was too big a gamble without a little help

  i want you to come with me sheriff
youve seen that rock about a hundred feet
this side of the tunnel you lay behind
that see and give me half an hour or so to
sneak around to the other side of the dump

  then you shoot once savvy and that
shotll be the signal for me to jump up and
pot them theyll both be lookin this way
and i can get them from behind ill pot
them from six or eight feet away

  thats the only way to do it-to make
sure agreed the kid ill fire the shot in
half an hour and theyll be easy pickings
for you

  lets go suggested mr conway
better take off your boots here your feet
wont get cut if you walk slow enough

  the kid sat down messrs conway and
carroll pulled off his boots

  youre heavier than me mr conway
then pointed out carroll and me will
lower you down then carroll alone can
handle my weight without trouble

  the kid readily fell in with this sugges-
tion when possible he played safe

  with the two men paying out on the rope
the kid descended into the valley the
rope suddenly went slack from below mr
conway heard a faint sound suggesting the
smash of a gun-butt on a stetson with the
kids head inside the stetson

  what was that inquired mr carroll
suspiciously leaning over to peer below

  this replied mr conway as he black-
jacked the other man with his colt and
pulled him back from the edge

  then he hauled up the rope tied one end
of it beneath the arms of the unconscious
mr carroll pushed him over the edge and
started lowering him down to the waiting
officers he heard the click of handcuffs
the rope went slack

  tally two he called out exuberantly
but softly

  got any more was the sheriffs
guarded answer

  not here but hold your hosses and
ill get some more stay there so ill know
where you are come a-runnin up the
trail when you hear me yell tally six

  with that mr conway waited until the
rope had been disengaged then pulled it
up coiled it and carried it away with him

  speck malone and bill hargis had just
been relieved from heir four-hour watch at
the head of the trail they had thrown
fresh fuel on the camp-fire causing it to
blaze high

  this was not at all to the liking of mr
conway darkness in large quantities was
what he craved with the odds four to one
against him the alert pair of desperadoes
on guard less than two hundred feet away
complicated his problem there could be
no violence or holding-up tactics in the
glare of the fire the nearness of one pair
of outlaws served automatically to guard
the other pair

  momentarily mr conway thought of
obtaining the assistance of summers and
hopkins then he dismissed the idea he
was mad sore clear through and it would
give him deep satisfaction to complete the
job single-handed-to deliver all six of the
gang to the sheriff

 deliver-

  mr conway ceased cogitating and
grinned the word had suggested a plan
one that was neat feasible and of particular
appeal to his sense of the fitting and proper

  he dropped the coil of rope on to a boul-
der and walked boldly into the glare of the
fire where speck malone had started to
pull off his boots preparatory to rolling into
his blankets

  say speck the sheriff and carroll want
you in on some kind of a scheme youre to
come back with me

  sufferin christmas-trees cant a man
get any sleep

  still grumbling speck pulled the boot
back on rebuckled his gun-belt took up
his rifle and started for the lower end of the
ridge

  with speck going on ahead it was easy for
mr conway to regain possession of the
rope

  easy-not so much noise he cautioned
better let me lead the way
reverse irish



  lead if you can do it so smoked-up
well was specks surly answer

  mr conway guided speck to the lowest
point on the rocks

  wheres the-sheriff was the sus-
picious inquiry

  down there-and no more talking
youre to join them

 the-i am

  thats summers order put your foot
in i his loop of the rope ill lower you
down

  perforce speck obeyed one thing the
yucca kid did not tolerate was insubordi-
nation

  with speck lowered half-way mr con-
way guardedly called out

  here comes speck watch out for him
summers

  a few seconds later as the rope slackened
came sounds indicating that speck had
been taken care of first a thud then
several seconds later the click of hand-
cuffs mr conway hauled up the rope
he didnt care at all about the method taken
to prevent the prisoners from calling out
the alarm when they regained conscious-
ness that was up to the sheriff

  after placing specks rifle in the patch of
brush where he had cached those belonging
to the kid and carroll mr conway leaned
over the cliff

  ill be back in fifteen minutes with
another one he announced

  what do you do to them was sum-
mers facetious query hypnotize them

  yes with my colt if they wont believe
fairy taks

  with that mr conway departed to get
another prisoner while the getting was
good

  on schedule fifteen minutes later he
returned with sandy bowen sandy had
been easily enticed even though his partner
sweitzer on guard was suspicious of mr
conway but sandy feared the kids
wrath if he failed to answer the alleged
summons he was lowered down the rope
to sudden unconsciousness from which he
presently emerged to discover himself hand-
cuffed his ankles strapped with a double
turn of his gun-belt and gagged with strips
of his own shirt

  in the mean time mr conway had start-
ed again toward the camp only two men
were left-bill hargis who by now un-
doubtedly was asleep and pinkeye sweit-

zer to whom mr conway had not been
introduced until late in the afternoon

  mr sweitzer was now alone on guard at
the trail he was regarded by mr conway
as being the most dangerous man in the
gang his appearance and attitude were
truculence personified and he kept the
bottom of his holster strapped down low on
his thigh

  ill just leave that sweitzer bird to the
last was mr conways decision hes
gonna start somethin or signs aint worth

a nickel-plated - he dont like me

and i got even less use for him

  therefore bill hargis was awakened from
peaceful slumber and notified that his pres-
ence was desired at a reception to be held by
sheriff summers and bob carroll bill
cussed with obvious sincerity then crawled
out of the blankets

  at that moment mr sweitzer was re-
vealed by the light of the fire walking
with soft tread his rifle at his hip menacing
mr conway he approached

  bill does this guy say that carroll
wants you

  yeh why

  it sounds almighty queer to me-and
his cornin to get us one at a time looks
wrong

  mentionin wrong sweitzer reminds
me that youll be in darned wrong with
summers for leavin the trail unguarded
drawled mr conway his eyes narrowed and
watching sweitzers rifle

  whats the trail-if youre gettin away
with some funny business i dont know
who you are the rest of the bunch think
youre a-fool i dont

  bill you hustle up to the trail im
goin to investigate whats goin on im
goin to keep this guy covered till im sure
that things are right

  he shifted the rifle perhaps an inch

  the inch was enough for mr conway
out came his colt he threw himself full
length sidewise the colt barked three
times before he struck the ground the
rifle roared once and missed by three feet
mr sweitzer doubled up and lost all interest
in his contemplated investigation

  no sooner had mr conway fallen than he
twisted around his weapon covered bill
hargis who had started to reach for his
gun-belt

  stop bill i dont want to shoot you

  bill stopped and raised his hands


adventure

  now roll yourself in your blanket

  bill rolled mr conway strapped the
gun-belt tight above bills elbows and bound
his ankles with thongs cut from a near-by
saddle then he hastened to the top of the
ridge

  tally six was the call that faintly
reached the ears of summers and hopkins

  ten minutes later the officers climbed up
the trail and came into the firelight mr
conway had thrown on more fuel the
light revealed both men as gaunt and hag-
gard this appearance was emphasized by
dirt and growths of beard and exaggerated
in turn by the flickering blaze

  summers glanced sharply about saw
sweitzers body and the trussed-up form of
bill hargis then advanced with out-
stretched hand mr conway took it

  conway said the sheriff i dont have
to tell you that you saved our lives but
i want to tell you this if you ever get
extradited it will be because i am in my
grave you say you want to serve the law
sure im gittin along in years and
i-

  thats enough interrupted the sheriff
how would you like the job of cleanin up
a town that claims its bad

  first rate grinned mr conway
where is it

  on the mohave desert a new boomoil-
town called derrickville its wide open
all the thieves yeggs gamblers toughs
and everything thats bad in nevada
arizona and california have flocked in
there

  san bernardino county is big i cant
be everywhere at onre derrickville as it is

at present is a black eye to the whole state
they have no law there do you want to
go there wearing a deputys badge and be
the law

  do i lead me to it

  mr conways tone was fervent

  the jobs yours and you get no instruc-
tions except to clean it up as you said to
me i wont give you a blue-print use
your own judgment

  the rest of the story can best be told by
a letter that sheriff summers received six
weeks later it read as follows

dear sheriff

  that deputy stunt is off i am resigning hereby
the town was sure wild but shes sure tame now
that last bunch of three shot-up birds just about

cleaned up

  i aint killed anybody yet but thats my fault
i only shot to wing them when i had to shoot
the rest of them know that i mean business the
towns getting so good that theyve started to build
a church

  the town aint incorporated yet but yesterday
i was elected mayor anyway also marshal justice
of the peace coroner and a few more things that
f cant think of off-hand the salaries dont amount
to much but ill sure get it because im the tax-
collector too

  hut wages aint worrying me none this town
has the rottenest bunch of poker-players i ever had
the luck to run across

  im sure glad bob carroll owned up that i won
the three horses from him let men coming this
way ride them over for me to save their stage-fare

  also find out for me what it costs to get ma-
chinery for a laundry i want to start one and
drive the chinks out a steam one i mean with
some one else doing the work for me

  how much does pavement cost im going to
have the main street paved as soon as i collect
taxes enough

respectfully

   our camp-fire came into being may   with our june issue and since then
its fire has never died down many have gathered about it and they are of all classes
and degrees high and low rich and poor adventurers and stay-at-homes and from all
parts of the earth some whose voices we used to know have taken the long trail
and are heard no more but they are still memories among us and new voices are
heard and welcomed

   we are drawn together by a common liking for the strong clean things of out-of-
doors for word from the earths far places for man in action instead of caged by cir-
cumstance the spirit of adventure lives in all men the rest is chance

   but something besides a common interest holds us together somehow a real com-
radeship has grown up among us men can not thus meet and talk together without
growing into friendlier relations many a time does one of us come to the rest for facts
and guidance many a close personal friendship has our camp-fire built up between
two men who had never met often has it proved an open sesame between strangers
in a far land

   perhaps our camp-fire is even a little more perhaps it is a bit of leaven working
gently among those of different station toward the fuller and more human understand-
ing and sympathy that will some day bring to man the real democracy and brotherhood
he seeks few indeed are the agencies that bring together on a friendly footing so many
and such great extremes as here and we are numbered by the hundred thousand now

    if you are come to our camp-fire for the first time and find you like the things we
like join us and find yourself very welcome there is no obligation except ordinary
manliness no forms or ceremonies no dues no officers no anything except men and
women gathered for interest and friendliness your desire to join makes you a member

letters from bill adams of our
j writers brigade make good listening
very good he didnt write the following
for publication im taking a liberty in
printing it for it is not the kind of thing
that should not be passed on most of us
need things like this far more than we need
the money we struggle for

on the way to frisco i rode with raggedys in-
numerable and for  miles yesterday with one
who was a dumb deaf-mute and had but one eye
at that

were all on the way said one of them to me
with a whimsical look upon his travel-stained
countenance but where is it were all a-goin 
said i to him dyou like flowers of the spring
said he to me with a curious look as though a
little child were homesick

  i sure do partner

  says i to him raggedy old-timer thats where
were all of us goin-in search of a flower-bloom of
spring-time

  the old battered hobo looked at me with his
two eyes all a-pucker searching for whatever it was
that he thought lay hid in my mind and presently
aye-thats it thats what it is-lookin fer
a flower as wont fade when summer comes eh
said he

  and together we rode past a church with a big
brazen bell and a gold cross upon its steeple and
endless folks full of sanctity-full as apple dumplings
are of apple within but much less delectable

and i have been of evenings sitting with cap-
tains of the gone years whose once valiant
ships are to-day deep down under they laughed
at and with me and i made them hold their sides
and the old wife of one of them with whom i sailed
a many times in other days around the horn held
her sides and said she

  oh my-adams ive laughed till im sick
and at that i too laughed looking at the picture
of a tall low clipper on the wall above her and
hearing sea laughter and waves rolling by with bright
music as the music of eternitys happy harping

  come soon and see us again adams said the
old white-haired woman who is very very close
to the gentle port that men call by a dark name
death whereas it should be called joy harbor
since the soundings are clear all about it

  the skipper gave me a picture of the old ship
running round the horn under main and fore reefed
topsails and staysls in a big brave sea and also
charts without number and the collar of the old
ships dog for my dog of today

an old wrinkle-eyed sea-captain who dwells
high in hills upon a farm where pears and nuts
grow when my old skipper introducing me said
heres one of my apprentices hes gone to writing




adventure

sea-stories said then ill tell him some too
and he told me with both hands on his knees and
his stubby body bowed forward and his eyes sea-
bright as the sun on the tides of dawn the story of
wag-hash the ships dog and the tale also of the
rooster which made soup for thirty scurvy-rid sailors
in the china sea

  and as long as theres a laugh to go round who
cares if our bellies arc empty and the cracks in our
palms are sore when the winds of the horn wail
by we are men the sons of men and the singers
of chanteys that shall ever be deathless are we not

  weaver asked me if i wuz religious a hard thing
to answer there are few indeed who are not so
but tastes and opinions vary so

  i have been toasting three captains in whisky as
old as themselves

  how should i know whether i am religious and
what does it matter as long as my hands haul on the
sheet and i know the rollick of the chantey-bill

harry d couzens whose complete
novelette appears in this issue died in
arizona in may  after a long brave
fight against tuberculosis our reprinting
brethren of the beach in enlarged form
is explained in a note at the beginning of
the story

 you old-timers will remember him for
his stories were favorites with you per-
sonally he was a man if you knew him
you liked him and admired him

 the following is from the arizona re-
publican of may  

u d couzens was for many years one of the
most prominent residents of honolulu t h
where he held the position of chief deputy in the
internal revenue service of the united states and
in that capacity gained distinction for efficiency in
the performance of the duties of an office which in
that territory where smuggling and other illicit
practises were unusually prevalent required the
exercise of much hardihood and courage

  during his residence in honolulu and later in
los angeles and new york mr couzens worked
assiduously at writing and painting in both of which
arts he gained a wide reputation although his
pictures depicting different phases of the tribal life
of the natives of hawaii and of aborigines of other
parts of the world brought him repeatedly into
favorable prominence in the united states his
greatest reputationwas earned as a writer of adven-
ture stories full of the tang of the south seas and
accurately descriptive of the islanders and of the
varied types of white men who live among them
his knowledge of these people was obtained through
personal association during his living and voyaging
among the myriad islands of the southern seas and
his writing was correspondingly true to life

he was i think the subject of the first
of those informal talks that grew into
our camp-fire department-when only
the page facing the opening page of an issue
was used for the purpose in those first

days the author did not talk direct to readers
but sent me the material from which i made
my little talk

the following is his letter to me giving
me the information i used in that first

talk 

   bom virginia ancestors fathers side long line
of sea-captains back to matthew couzens original
settler at newport who was captain of british
privateer hence roving disposition i suppose
educated and intended for civil engineer left
new york in  for honolulu where i lived 
years returning in  to new york intending to
finish my engineering course and continue as the
successor of my grandfather matthew k couzens
a civil engineer of yonkers n y but found i was
too good a draftsman had always done drawing
and painting after a fashion but decided to take up
art seriously as a career i studied at the art
league and the old william m chase school on
rd street and later went to paris where i studied
in the julian school and in the studios of carolus
duran and j l grome as i had no funds for
this i was obliged to earn every cent as i went
along and my years of study were a period of some
privation upon which i do not look back with much
pleasure i have a house in paris or rather the
little suburb of renard which i havent seen for
fifteen years

tn  i left new york for honolulu and lived

   there till  in  when the islands were
formally annexed to the u s i was appointed chief
deputy in the internal revenue service and held
that office in honolulu till  from  till
 i lived in san francisco when by special re-
quest i accepted the appointment of chief deputy
of internal revenue in los angeles california
had been divided into two official districts and my
services were in demand as an expert to help them
establish the new southern district i accepted a
-day appointment but at the end of that period
was asked to officiate for  days longer and did so
i came to new york in  returning to los
angeles in january  to settle some business
matters

co much for bare facts these as they stand

   are not particularly interesting and you can
utilize them as you see fit the real stuff that you
want ill try to string along at random for in-
stance

   i have cruised in the south seas have chummed
with traders blackbirders beach-combers remit-
tance-men and sailors kipling once said that if
one lived at port said long enough he would meet
everybody in the world i think this is truer of
honolulu than it is of port said-at least youll
meet them there in less time i met robert louis
stevenson in king kalakauas stand at the old race-
track and ive sat with jack london on the lanai
of the seaside hotel and heard him roast his critics
by the hour i have gone back and forth across the
pacific on army transports and found old school-
mates in captains uniform seated opposite me at
mess i think i have as large a nodding or speaking
acquaintance as any man in the world

   this may be trite enough stuff and i realize that
the camp-fire

i 

you want things you can use to advantage it is
harder i assure you to write this sort of thing than
episodic fiction i may say that my best friend in
honolulu was captain albert h otis who was
captain of the yacht casco when stevenson took
his celebrated cruise and who is the original of
captain nares in the wrecker he dear man
has been the unconscious original of more than one
of my fictitious sailor-men

t have slept out in the hills in the quest for
moonshiners and being entirely an out-of-door
man by instinct and inclination have ridden horses
of all tempers and breeds sailed boats of all rigs
and used firearms of all descriptions since i was too
young to remember revolver-shooting is a hobby
and i have several trophies for revolver and shot-
gun work like stevenson i too have slept out in
portsmouth square under the sky and like him too
all my life i have tried to write and seen my most
ambitious efforts essays etc overlooked here
the resemblance probably ceases

t have always had the inclination for literature
and have been actually writing for publication
since  when a story of mine which appeared
in outing fired me with the ambition to peg away
and make good in this way but it was later when i
was in the revenue service in honolulu that i
began to tackle the real stuff i used to go down
to the office in the old palace and plug away on my
stories sometimes all night long and many of my
things that are appearing now are the direct result
of that patient industry some of it i sold but i
hoarded the rest against the great idea of coming
east to the proper market for it and making good

   i was actually on my way to new york with this
idea when i reached san francisco in  then
i reasoned with myself something after this fashion
i knew san francisco after a fashion but i knew
no one there who would be of the slightest use or
help to me whereas in new york i had friends and
influence why then would it not be a good idea
to try it on the dog in other words see if i
could make good there first i set myself a mark
it was to sell sunset magazine a good story one
that i approved of myself illustrated by myself
and then i would keep on my way east

   well i did it i sold them a good many other
things cover pictures illustrations etc and did
considerable work for the art department of the
southern pacific i turned out stuff for various
publications including the western field the news-
letter and crockers monthly and had various in-
terests with engraving firms and lithographers that
kept me pretty busy i felt in the beginning that
i was taking a sporting chance that was my reason
for stopping there in the first place but as soon as
they published on mokapu beach with my illus-
trations i packed my trunks

   then came the appointment to the district of
southern california and i spent the following year
there looking out for the interests of uncle sam
shooting quail and ducks and catching rainbow
trout-altogether a busy and interesting year

t think this is about all i know you dont
want anything of the personal adventure stuff
in this else i could branch off into various flights
perhaps you can find enough to answer your purpose
in what i have written here you might dwell on


the fact that the south seas and its people and what
men do with schooners have been the things of
particular interest to me and i have made an effort
to set some of them down in an interesting way
im still trying of course and i trust that billy
englehart and i will have many a wild cruise to-
gether the company of that celebrated ruffian
is meat and drink to me as billy bones says

xtou will be interested to know that the
 o henry memorial committee in
awarding the prizes for the best stories of
the year chose as one high on their selected
list rra boloi by crosbie garstin pub-
lished in our magazine during  un-
fortunately when they wrote to find out
whether mr garstin is an american-
prizes can be given only to stories by ameri-
can authors published in american maga-
zines-the facts compelled me to tell them
that he is an englishman

  here is part of a letter from mrs ethel
watts mumford of the prize story com-
mittee

  i am sorry that we can not include mr garstins
story in the   henry memorial book the
prize judges passed upon it with a most unusual
unanimity as the best horror story of the year it
might interest mr garstin to know that dr
williams has been using it in the short story course
at columbia university as an example of excellent
construction in the opinion of the committee
mr garstin is to be congratulated on an excellent
piece of work and we hope to read more from his
pen in the near future even if we may not include
him among our american authors-ethel watts

something from captain a e
dingle in connection with his story in
this issue

hamilton bermuda

  a bit of dope about joe monkeyface may be
acceptable since he was a live human being when
i was just about out of my apprenticeship in sailing
ships in my home town oxford england i saw
while on leave a pitiful little devil being dragged
around town by his half imbecile mother and being
made to dance for hapennies he was called joe
monkeyface as in the yarn when i secured my
second mates berth i asked the old man to take
joe as a cabin-boy or deck-boy he refused when he
saw the lad but i cajoled him around and joe sailed
with us to australia and around the world home

  joe never amounted to much as a man his early
life was all against giving him a chance but he did
once fight with tooth and nail another boy on the
railway pier at melbourne until he dropped to
avenge ill-treatment of a mangv cat and when we
docked in london again eighteen months after
sailing i managed to get joe taken into a home as
an easy-going roustabout where he still was at last
hearing though no longer a boy but a quiet gray-
haired old-young man with a peaceful if not event-
ful end before him cheerio-dingle

f  he following from a pamphlet issued
by a mclane one of our comrades
contains some things worth thinking about

cripples

by red the rambler

ne of the petty annoyances of being con-
spicuously crippled or deformed is the amount
of unnecessary questions asked of the one who is
marked by the noticeable affliction we make
allowances for sympathetic or business inquiries

   but when one must tell probably a couple of dozen
of folks every day just why when and where he got
knocked out it gets decidedly monotonous

  during the sixteen years i carried a bum flat
wheel and the month or two since the same was
amputated i have answered thousands of questions
on this subject i have made it a rule to give
satisfactory replies when the inquiries were in earnest
and had good reasons for asking but often when
a little grouchy i have left an over curious ques-
tioner as much in the dark by my replies as before
for instance in st louis mo i informed a little
darky on one block that i have fallen out of a well
lawdy he exclaimed his eyes bulging on the
next block i explained to a stranger the way a steam
boat had run over my leg on block no  i dis-
pensed to questioner no  the information that i
was once kicked by a canary bird now i tell them
that my leg was bitten off

  speaking of maimed people the question is often
asked why are cripples when placed at work they
are capable of performing often the most steady and
reliable of workmen

  there are several reasons for this one is that
one who is physically handicapped feels the un-
conscious challenge of the world to make good in
competition with able-bodied men another is the
self-respect that comes from holding down what
may be a disagreeable hard and uncongenial job
inorder to be self-supporting and independent

vif ost cripples understand fully why it is more
blessed to give than to receive therefore
they try to make their own way in the world rather
than to fall back on the easier  way of bum-
ming it often one hears remarks about the ap-
parent cheerfulness of this class in general i once

heard a gentleman make the statement that it seems
that the creator purposely blesses the permanently
invalid or crippled with a sunshiny disposition to
counteract their suffering take it from one who
knows about  per cent of the cheerfully afflicted
are camouflaging but all honor to those who suffer
in silence

  now dear reader we come to the real message
or perhaps we should say warning if we sub-
stitute the almighty dollar for the simple religion of
christ the golden rule then we are like unto
the foolish surgeon who removed a mans perfectly
good legs and substituted in their place a couple of
pegs made of decayed timber

jgyjllo wing camp-fire custom walter
r marsden rises to introduce himself
on the occasion of his first story in our
magazine

new york city

  ive been watching the fire for some time
ive even sneaked up dose enough to listen in now
that ive been caught at it the outfit is doomed to
listen to my tale of woe

  new york has the honor  of being my birth-
place ive roamed a few seen a lot of the u s a
and some of canada im nutty about guns and
hunting at an early age i became an ardent fol-
lower of nimrod considering guides a nuisance
and an unnecessary expense i went on a trip alone
i leave the rest to your imagination among other
things i succeeded in losing myself for three days in
the woods tried to get into the big muss but got
no further than camp on this side of the pond how
they finished the show without me still remains a
mystery to me

  well im thinking id better amble out for some
wood and give some other buddy a chance to orate

how about wild horses in our west
today one of you asked at camp-
fire and here are some of the replies that
came in any more information

tucumcari new mexico

  wild horses are being exterminated by the stock-
men of the west rapidly some because they in-
terfere with the grazing of stock and more because
some people just naturally have o have a shot at
anything within range not very long ago 
i have been on a survey trip through the smoke
creek desert and buffalo meadows in nevada
these regions as also blue wing valley carson
sink and eastern shore of pyramid lake are full of
wild horses and we have even killed two of them at
the coyote pass

  these wild horses are just a little larger than shet-
land ponies weighing around five hundred pounds
and look like a small cow-pony

  it is very seldom you can get near them except
by surprize but very often you can see them
plainly when they are going to or from water i
have also seen them in utah and northwestern
arizona if any one wishes to see the wild horses
just get on the train and have your ticket read via
western pacific lovelock nevada get an out-
fit here and hike about fifty miles to blue wing
the camp-fire



 spring foot of nightingale mountains and here
 you are certainly bound to see them

  maybe some of you old-timers have been there
 and seen them if so seak up-p w kossar

oakland california

   when i was a kid in the seventies wild horses
 were still very plentiful on the heads of the smoky
 hill and republican rivers in western kansas and
 i have seen many and helped capture some they
 were not native to america the horse having been
 introduced into mexico by the spaniards and spread
 northward among the indian tribes by theft and
 barter the wild horses were originally strays
 mainly of the mustang type that is small active
 running all colors from yellow buckskin to black
 with many spotted pintos black and white bay and
 white yellow and white all sorts of combinations
 of color

 a fter travel set in across the plains runaways
 from the emigrant trains joined the wild bands
 and so quite a lot of racing and saddle blood was
 introduced and some of the wild stock were very
 fast perfect well-built animals

   if the settlement of the plains had been delayed
 another hundred years it is probable that the wild
 horses would have outnumbered even the buffalo
 as they were more hardy could graze a greater dis-
 tance from water and snow had no terrors for them
 if there is grass two or three feet of snow doesnt
 bother a horse they will paw through it

   along about  horses were so cheap that in
 western colorado many horse outfits wouldnt
 bother to look after or brand their stock and the
 herds increased with incredible rapidity so that in
 a few years it was necessary to shoot them by
 thousands for the hides in order to save the grass
 for the cattle this shows how rapidly they increase

   there were three methods of capturing wild horses
 they could be run down and roped that is the
 slower ones could they could be walked down
 that is a few men with pack horses could start
 after a band and keep them on the move at first
 the horses would run clear away from their pur-
 suers but these kept steadily on the trail and in a
 week or more the wild band would become so worn
 out from constant travel and lack of time to feed
 that they could be worked into a corral as toward
 the last they became used to their pursuers and
 would barely keep out of their way horses have a
 well-defined range and would travel in a circle
 which enabled the hunters to relay on them it was
 said that a party of indians say a war-party that had
 been dismounted has more than once walked down
 a band of wild horses and obtained fresh mounts

 the third method of capture was to watch a des-
 ert waier-hole and when a band came and filled
 up run down and rope as many as possible as the
 wild stock was so full of water that they couldnt
 run horses will graze fifty miles from water if
 grass is scarce coming in about noon every other
 day and fill up all that their skins will hold thats
 what makes desert-raised horses such long-winded
 brutes from the day that they are born they
 spend their time running for water before they
 die of thirst and running for grass before they
 starve

   as far as i know there have been no real wild
 horses on the plains since about 

  i overlooked in giving methods of capture
creasing

  that is shooting the animal through the top of
the neck just forward of the shoulder with a small
caliber hardened bullet so as to make a small
clean hole the shock would knock the animal in-
sensible and it would remain that way for several
minutes long enough to run up and hog-tie it

f course this was usually done at short range
not much over a hundred yards although i have
seen it done at much greater distance butat the
long ranges the horse was generally either missed or
killed

  these wounds would heal quickly and the horse
would be all right in a few hours

  a little more wild horse dope inclosed you re-
member that i told you the same thing happened
in colorado twenty-five years ago these mon-
tana horses must have come up in the last ten years
there were few if any then they increase like
rabbits if hides were worth anything thered be
a chance for some one to make a stake killing them

  these horses are not wild in the sense of being
vicious or dangerous said mitchell they are
merely roaming at large suggestion has been made
that the state kill them but authority is lacking
the livestock commission has authority to take up
vagrant horses and sell them using the money de-
rived from the sale to pay the cost but sale is im-
possible no one will buy them

  the wild horses against which the stock growers
are directing a fight are the descendants of indian
cayuses scrubby little animals of  and 
pounds in the early days of the state they were
occasionally gathered and sold by the indians for
 to  each

  been in this section past winter spending much
of my time in hills when roads and trails were open
and find many wild horses as close as thirty-five
miles south of the railroad here starting in at wa-
ter-holes between the grants which begin about
at that distance and their numbers increasing as
you turn toward mt hope from that point on
south they may be found in herds of twenty and
more

  punchers in this section often build traps and
bag them for their personal benefit it is not always
impossible to tame them down to make a good rid-
ing and cutting pony

  also encountered several in southeastern colo-
rado buttes and cedar hills in  but not as many
there at that time as are in this section now-billy

  i arise to remark that there are thousands of
wild horses and some few man-killers running to
the range in many parts of the western u s there
is however not a band of horses in this country
that is not claimed by an owner they no longer
have free range the ranches of today being well

adventure

fenced the insignificant bronc of former years
has been supplanted by a good-sized rugged west-
ern horse due to the infusion of draft blood these
stallions having been turned in with bands of horses

  thousands of range horses are marketed here
every year and they are plenty wild but the day of
the handsome stallion proudly leading his band and
roaming at free will is past and gone-a h pen-

  the wild horse is to be seen on a few of our ranges
yet although like some of our other wild animals
it has very nearly been exterminated

  i have seen and owned very serviceable horses
that were caught out of some wild bunch but for
the most part they are undersized and not good for
much of anything besides they are hard to break
it takes a man who understands them pretty well
to break them properly

  i knew one horse that we caught down in the
cow creek country in nevada fair size well built
and with a disposition that was a cross between
chain lightning and t n t but for one who could
handle him he was one of the best saddle-horses in
the state

  in most localities where there are wild horses
left stockmen are killing them off claiming that
the wild horse is a menace to the range

  i have spent a fair part of my time running them
and while i dont believe it pays from a financial
standpoint there is or was a fascination that draws
one

  there is a rancher south of here who has a large
ranch and plenly of money-the chance of course
to take life easy-but of all things he would rather
run wild horses he keeps a string of saddle-horses
that have endurance and speed and i think he can
boast of having caught more frizzies than most
of the rest of us who have tried-marion f reese

san diego calif

  i notice that this month you are asking about the
wild horse supply the mexicans say that there
are several bands existant south of the colorado on
the mainland and that there are smaller bands still
living on the plains and walking the caminos of
baja california in the northern district i have
never seen any there but unshod tracks are numer-
ous in many of the draws there are hundreds of
wild burros all through the peninsula and it would
undoubtedly stand to reason that many horses have
strayed south of the american line few ameri-
cans travel in the desert regions and it certainly
would be a stunt to get any horses out that were
there now

  zane grey described the wild-horse bands in a
book about his lion-lassoing visit south of the colo-
rado his description was vivid and true and per-
haps would give another line on the existing horse
bands i can not recall the name of the book but
it is in almost every public library it is almost in-
conceivable that the horse bands would die out for
the country is almost inaccessible and there are
thousands of miles of desert for the horses to cover
-chas m stetson jr

two of our comrades a krombach and
lee whitestone are probably now in
the south on their years trip touring the
border of the whole united states in a light

six-cylinder car they write that they are
using the camp-fire stations to have their
mail forwarded and will visit as many sta-
tions as possible along their route

a station may be in any shop home or
other reputable place the only require-
ments are that a station shall display the
regular station sign provide a box or drawer
for mail to be called for and preserve the
register book

  no responsibility for mail is assumed by anybody the
station merely uses ordinary care entries in register to be
coniined to name or serial number route destination
permanent address and such other brief notes or remarks as
desired each station can impose its own limit  space to
be used registers become permanent property of station
signs remain property of this magazine so that if there is
due cause of complaint from members a station can be
discontinued by withdrawing sign

  a station bulletin board is strongly to b recommended
as almost necessary on it travelers can leave tips as to
conditions of trails etc resident members can post their
names and addresses such hospitality as they care to offer
calls for any travelers who are familiar with countries these
residents once knew calls for particular men if they happen
that way etc notices or tips about local facilities and con-
ditions letters to resident members can be posted on this
bullet in-board

  any one who wishes is a member of camp-fire and
therefore entitled to the above station privileges subject to
the keepers discretion those offering hospitality of any
kind do so on their own responsibility and at their own risk
and can therefore make any discriminations they see fit
traveling members will naturally be expected to remember
that they are merely guests and act accordingly

  a station may offer only the required register and mail
facilities or enlarge its scope to any degree it pleases its
possibilities as headquarters for a local club or resident
camp-fire members are excellent

  the only connection between a station and this magazine
is that stated above and a keeper is in no other way re-
sponsible to this magazine nor representative of it

that cowboy picture

jhe art editor has the floor in the december
th issue we published a picture of a cowboy
riding a steer and asked you whether or not the
artist was a man or a woman-familiar or unfamiliar
with his subject also we sort of half promised
a years subscription for the best answer as i
handle the pictures the job fell to me thats where
the rub comes

  some of us in the office have a bowing acquain-
tance only with cattle and after having read the
hundred-odd letters received filled with details of
their vicious habits especially when ridden were
content to let it go at that we have never mea-
sured a steers tail nor have we circumnavigated its
belly we dont even know whether its horns twist in
or out and yet we have received dozens of letters
calling attention to just those points

  expert cowmen among you have written in saying
that the picture is correct in every detail other
cowmen just as well qualified tell us that the
picture looks as much like a llama or a love-sick
gnu as it does a steer

  if this particular steer could read the only thing
he would be sure about himself is that he has four
legs you all agreed on that

  thirty-six per cent of the letters said the artist
was a woman thirty-one per cent thought he was a
man thirty-three per cent did not care to express
an opinion sixty per cent thought the picture was
true to life and forty per cent did not

  we received photographs proving that the picture
was correct and that it wasnt some of you said
that the picture was a photograph retouched at
least six of you recognized the artists work and
named him-ross santee

  and with that facing us we have to choose the
best letter

  i think we may safely say that mr santee knows
his subject he is a practical cowman himself as to
the merits of drawing-after all a picture is not
a photograph nor should it reproduce every detail
with photographic accuracy rather its purpose
should be to stir the imagination and so i think
the following letter wins the years subscription

  if we ever run another contest well choose for
our own peace of mind some nice simple subject
like a triangle or a perfect square-nothing so com-
plicated as a bucking steer-l b barretto

hot springs arkansas

  in spite of page  of dec th adventure being
addressed to cowboys i think a statement from out-
side that great fraternity is not out of place

  the drawing is that of ross santee his work by
its very dash and possible exaggeration gives the
same feeling one has on seeing the frantic perform-
ance of a cowboy and accomplice

  in art this impression of life is the great tiling
the technical detail and minutiae are not what
a thoroughly thrilled audience is thinking about

  and when an artist succeeds in interpreting so
vividly the cowboy and his spirit i think the matter
of detail correct or incorrect is unimportant as it
is in reality compared to the anxiety as to whether
the cowboy stays on or not-frances hordin

touring

raymond s spears has prepared
the subjoined circular for free distri-
bution if after reading it you desire it for
permanent reference you may obtain it
printed on tougher paper than we use in the
magazine itself by writing him at little
falls remember to enclose stamp and
self-addressed envelop

  im sending to have printed into another ask
adventure information slip touring which
covers briefly some  words i wrote out some
time since to cover this phase of wandering

  ive put into it particular information to answer
most specific questions and a good many general
questions about touring it will save a good many
thousand words writing in letters if touring-season
inquiries of the past are any criterion

  probably half those who want to go want to earn
their way some want to do it trapping himting
being gay cowboys etc so heres another slip
copy for which i enclose earning ones way
a lot of women young and old one  years are
growing wings on their feet too big jim harri-
man writes me about two well-educated- girls who
asked if laced boots or oxfords would be best walk-
ing from minneapolis to yellowstone park and the
grand canon-oxfords in the desert sands big
jim just sighed

   well heres the leaflet on touring
the one on earning ones way will
appear in an early issue-maybe the next
one seeing the subject is so timely at this
time of year

thk highways and by-ways of the united states
offer infinite variety of scenery experience op-
portunities and delight road maps can be had
for any state through local book or stationery
stores or through any automobile clubs study
the maps go on foot bicycle motor-cycle any

kind of automobile in good condition many wander
with horses and prairie schooners are still met
throughout the west

  on foot one carries his outfit in a pack on his
 back a splint basket is good army leather and
 other packs can be had for cooking frying-pan
 two nesting pails with covers the larger holding
 about  pints frying-pan toasting-fork -inch
 handle a tin tray for table cutlery two plates cup
 perhaps small wire grid an all-wool blanket
 water-proof canvas larger then blanket cloth bags
 to carry grub matches in water-proof safe a stout
 jack-knife with three good blades a vest-pocket
 camera and two rolls of film for each day weight
 not over  lbs lighter would be better this is a
 bicycle outfit too except the basket pack in canvas
 bags for luggage carrier no weapon is needed for
 protection be sure to wear thick-soled shoes
 for walking

  for motor-cycle as above also small baker-
model tent ground-cloth sewed in jointed poles
more grub can of water keep weight under 
lbs especially if two go

  automobile touring outfits depend on car just
as necessary to go light as when on foot however
generally spealang not more than five people
should go in seven-passenger car three or four in
five-passenger car but children to the full number
of seats or more adapt themselves but they must
have room to wriggle and stretch

  total outfit should not weigh more than  lbs
 for each person for children simplest plainest
 easiest washed clothes-bloomers knickers etc
 for men light comfortable garments knicker-
 bockers long stockings neglige shirts light-weight
 shoes but have heavy shoes along and also several
 changes of clothes on long tour have close-woven
 woolen shirts rather than sweaters two or three
 light all-wool shirts better than one heavy one
 skirts about two yards wide for medium-weight
 women reaching to shoe-tops shoes for varying
 weather-light to ride in several light garments
 serve better than one heavy very light caps if
 any as a hat cuts the forehead a rainproof for
 each individual each one should have duffel in
 bag or suitcase old and young ones

  individual cots all-wool bedding and perhaps
adventure

cord hammocks two can sleep in touring-car on
a car-bed and sometimes all will sleep in their seats
wrapped in blankets-and sleep well too after
experience

  a light-material tent--ounce say waterproofed
with something that will not dry hard check or
mildew which one can put up-is the only kind to
have any outfit that takes more than  minutes
to make into a comfortable camp is a failure
sould pack in less than  minutes but  per
cent of auto-touring outfits are failures because of
overweight and complications

  special automobile cooking and eating outfits are
desirable all nesting in boxes a party of four may
well carry six-person outfit however carry a good
grid a small two-burner gasoline stove with
wind-break is good every outfit everywhere
should carry water-cans on running-bcmrd a
sheet-iron stove is common on the road two
-gallon half-moon cans wool-covered fastened to
ringbolts for drinking and radiator are good keep
full of best water available gallon can for oil
fill gasoline tank at every pump in open country

  have dust-proof cupboard for food carry
several days supply have quick-meals for emer-
gencies buy fresh meat fruit vegetables at
towns recommended by other tourists as good
places to patronize cupboard for food behind
front seats with doors to use for table is good notion
a light dressmakers table and a tray for each
member of party add much to eating comfort

  pack all bedding in light water-proof canvas bags
roll everything into bundles in water-proof canvas
sheet dont have any bundle weight more than
fifty pounds lash each bundle separately and
then tie fast with separate line or cinch-canvas
strap to ringbolts on running-board trunk-carrier
or whatever according to make of car big canvas
cover-all on trunk-carrier to fold over and lash is
good idea pack tent in separate roll covered with
wear-saver of canvas sheet say the ground-cloth
carry net twine trot-line six hanks say and 
ft of rope for towing

  make lists of each part of outfit food cooking
and table wear bedding and individual kits keep
every variety separate in packing bundles

  a baker-model lean-to tent beside the car with
ground-cloth sewed in and flap doorsill as high as the
running-board keeps out wind rodents and other
undesirable things or large detached water-
proofed ground-cloth folded into the tent ground-
cloth all around and up on the running-board is
good dont carry a mattress two or three
layers of felt quilted with bed-ticking which may
well be waterproofed will serve to sleep on ground-
cloth for mosquitoes cheese-cloth curtains
tucked and laced or pinned all around

  before undertaking a long journey try outfit
several nights running out making camp and com-
ing in in the morning this saves carrying useless
things emphasizes what must be taken and gives
the party practise in making and breaking camp-
which is indispensable for comfort peace and know-
ing

  strange roads are always dangerous where least
expected take no chances twenty miles an hour
is the limit with a loaded car  miles a day a trip
limit and west of the mississippi  miles a day is
enough have main meal fornoon hour resting
and eating you may not find a good camping-
place till midnight or break down

  dont hurry better  miles and enjoy it
than  miles and lose joy from weariness
rushing spoils a trip killing all one travels for
children must have exercise and play

  cold-cream theatrical cream etc for dust and
alkali-water effects on the skin eat fruit camp
early keep camp-sites clean help the other fellow

  automobile expenses are according to the make
and driver accidents and breaks come from haste
most tourists figure from si  to  a week ex-
pense for a car and its occupants including every-
thing when running six days a week car expense
stops when the party stops however take one
day a week for greasing oiling tightening up and
cleaning car this saves a lot of money starting
with car in perfect condition new tires and outfit
all expenses of a car are no more than around home
per mile each person in the car may live on one
dollar or less a day careful drivers seldom have
accidents dont start with old tires and expect
to escape tire trouble

  a good spot-light a handy light flash-lights
and a bulb on a long wire with plug for switching
in battery to light road-signs motor car camp-
ground and tent are worth the expense and trouble
but dont run with spot-light burning as these are
illegal in some states and places keep brakes
lights hom ignition motor gears tires in perfect
order

  eor firearms good revolver or pistol a  auto-
matic is as good as any for practise a  single shot
or repeater rifle a  or  gage shotgun a -
- or similar carbine rifle most states forbid
concealed weapons without permit and all states
have game and non-resident hunting laws

  fishing-tackle steel rod for bait casting still
and other fishing tackle for the fish of the region
to be visited

  membership in automobile clubs chambers of
commerce boards of trade and other organizations
giving identification cards auto licenses etc are
invaluable in emergency of financial stringency ac-
cident etc for cashing checks obtaining favors of
all kinds

  be courterous help the other fellow observe all
laws be careful dont be afraid camp in bared
spaces away from brush and stone heaps and never
leave a fire a minute clean the camp for the

  	i am about fifty years old and slightly

and likely stay there if financial and climatic con-
ditions were favorable

  	would a small motor-boat be of any special
use and could fuel be obtained-thomas j
hughes santa maria calif

  answer by mr mills- from your own city
you can sail direct to rarotonga the center of tha
cook islands on one of the new zealand-u s s
cos steamers which leave san francisco every
three weeks for wellington the capital of new zea-
land calling at rarotonga which is less than a
weeks steam from wellington

   	salubrious and healthy

   	no snakes but swarms of obnoxious bugs

  	few birds and animals but splendid fishing
and lots of it and then some

   	fruits and coconuts

  	simple fare which nature provides in pro-
fusion other commodities being imported about
the same as in your own home town living a
bit cheaper in the islands than in america

   	no you can get all requirements on the spot

   	there is a fairly stiff protective duty imposed
on imports arranged on the scale of new zea-
lands customs the cook group being a dependency
of new zealand

  	the natives of the cook islands are closely
allied to the maons of new zealand and are of the
same brown-textured skin coming under the
influence of the london missionary societys
missionaries a ccntury ago the cook islanders are
more civilized are better educated speaking
english like you and me and live closer to euro-
pean ideas than any other inhabitants of the
pacific islands and they are friendly to a degree
toward all visitors from overseas

   	tinned goods of all kinds and pretty things
that can be sold at a reasonable price appeal to the
islanders

   	it is not considered the proper thing for the
white man to do anything but overseeing but you
would need to be on the spot to see what oppor-
tunities are offered and you certainly should not
make the venture without having money to help
you along for some time

  	if you are near a carnegie or other public
library you could look up the books published in
america

   	answered in first lines and the fare when i
last inquired was approximately third-class single
san francisco to rarotonga 

  	i would not advise a tuberculous person of
your age to go to the islands-not bracing enough
too enervating and you would probably not be
allowed to land

  	a motor-boat certainly would be very use-
ful and petrol etc is available

fly-fishing for carp

theyre evidently a better fish to
catch than to eat its not necessary
to catch one to know that all youve got
to do is to eat one and youll be quite sure

  question-i will be very thankful to you if
you will tell me how to catch fresh-water carp
we have a large fresh-water pond and the feeder
pond and overflow are infested with carp that are
rapidly exterminating the game fish therein it
is impossible to drain or net the pond as it is too
large-about three miles long-while the rivers
are much longer

   aside from the fact that we would like to get rid
of them we are also very anxious to find out what
a large one would do if caught on a five-ounce fly-
rod every once in a while we hear of one being
caught but to date have never been able to verify
the tale personally i have fished for days at a
time using night-walkers white-bread dough
and also raw white potatoes for bait but to date
have never had even a nibble

  what kind of bait do you advise should one
fish deep or shallow what time of the day and
kind of weather is best should one use a float
what size hook should be used is it possible to
use an artificial bait liquid or pasts if so what
kind-c l d hosking butler n j

  answer by mr thompson-a carp on a fly-
rod will kick up an awful fuss as much in fact as
a bass of equal weight they will bore and not do
the leaping of a bass

   carp are deep feeders and whether you are fishing
in shallow or deep water keep the bait right on the
bottom the best luck i have had is with dough-
balls made half of com-meal and half of wheat
flour rolled into a ball then dropped into hot
water for a few seconds it seems to toughen it
and is better for luring the carp by adding
chopped liver-very fine-to the dough-ball it has
proven a better killer also i have chopped up
dead minnows and worked them up in the dough
speaking from my experience this is the best bait
i know of and i have caught them with it in lakes
and rivers when worms dough and everything else
failed me once in a while i have caught them on
a trot-line with dead minnows by weighting it so
it was entirely on the bottom

a trip to japan

very pleasant-if you have money 
but not to be attempted on spec

  question-as i am contemplating a trip to
japan within a year i would appreciate your advice
kindly answer the following questions

   	what is the best time of the year to visit japan

   	what route and line would you suggest taking

   	what are the traveling conditions throughout
japan

   	what and where are the most interesting places
to visit in the islands

  	are there many americans in japan engaged
in commerce

   perhaps the following questions are going beyond
your service if so please disregard them

  	would it be possible for me to sell american
adventure

products in japan acting as a free-lance salesman
for any lines i could secure

  	can you suggest a way to secure american
lines

  	could i secure commissions to buy japanese
products for american houses can you suggest
a way to secure commissions

  please do not print my name or address in adven-
ture if forwarded there

  answer by mrs knudson-i will take your
questions up as you have put them

  	the best time of year to visit japan is any
time in my opinion but the tourist seasons of
spring and autumn offer the best traveling facili-
ties from march to may and from september
to november both inclusive the climate is delight-
ful and the country everywhere is at its best

  	the route and line to go are matters of indi-
vidual taste if you want to make a quick voyage
there are the northern routes from vancouver
seattle or tacoma--by boats of the canadian
pacific ocean services ltd nippon yusen kaisha
or osaka chosen kaisha if you want a longer
sea experience to keep in the sunshine belt and get
all you can for your money then sail from san
francisco on either a pacific mail s s cc boat
or a toyo kisen kaisha steamer and see honolulu
on the way theres small choice in lines unless
you prefer to patronize an american-managed
one or want to go on the largest boat or want
second-class accommodations-which by the way
are often quite desirable get the folders of these
companies

  	it is fairly easy to travel about japan rail-
ways connect all the larger towns and cities
through trains have sleeping and dining car accom-
modations and guards and train-boys who speak
enough english for one to make his ordinary wants
known the ticket-sellers in the stations gen-
erally speak some english there are many inter-
island steamers autos street-cars and jinrikishas
are available for large-city travel and rikishas are
to be procured almost everywhere in the smaller
towns and country public roads are under process
of great improvement at present

  	yokohama tokyo nikko kobe nara osaka
nagoya kyoto and nagasaki are the cities you
will want to see most of the thomas cook and
the raymond whitcomb tourist agencies also the
steamship companies above referred to publish
free booklets that will give you more extended
information on this point theres a regular route
tourists are apt to follow given in such booklets
and all places are interesting and each city has its
own places of note visit some railroad general
office and get all the pamphlets you can on japan

  	there are a goodly number of americans
doing business in japan-just how many i do not
know the number has increased during the past
two years with an increase of business interests
between the two countries most of these manage
some branch of some united states house or
represent in some way a large firm in america
there are a few americans however who have
established an independent business in the empire

  	anything is possible but a free-lance sales-
man in japan with no knowledge of customs or
language would be working against tremendous
difficulties

   and  the only thing i can suggest is that you

take some periodical reviewing oriental trade and
markets and watch for suggestions and study the
advertising to learn what houses are doing business
in japan there are several papers of the sort
published right where you are on the pacific coast
go into some oriental trading company and ask
about such periodicals-theyll know what you
want another is the trans-pacific magazine with
an office in san francisco

  most american houses trading in the orient
prefer to send some one to buy who is trained in
their own policies and who has had experience in
oriental buying

  your best way would be to connect with some
house which could use your individual abilities and
training or gather about your buying services a
group of say small art-shops who want japanese
goods directly imported and can not afford to send
their own buyer over i met one very bright
young woman several years ago who sold american
candy in japan and while there bought goods at
her own risk these she brought back and sold to
art-shops here at home

  there are many ways of making a success in the
buying and selling game even with great difficul-
ties against one but you wart to be very sure of
yourself before going into a field of strange lan-
guage and customs an american beach-comber
in the orient is net a pleasant thing to contemplate

  however the will to do makes the way open to
success if you will hard enough and know what
you are willing about

  every good wish for your success if you do go over

prospecting in alaska

big chance for the right man-after the
boob has located the ore

  question-a friend and myself have been think-
ing of going to alaska to prospect and make our
stake if possible we have been told that it is
useless to go there as it is all over and the only good
places belong to guggenheim but i maintain there
are deposits just as large as ever were found if you
are a lucky guy

  what do you think we mean to take a chance
anyhow and any information on your part will
certainly be appreciated your info may also make
us change our plans we have prospected in most
of the mineral states of the west and have roughed
it quite a bit but still have many things to learn
nevertheless consider ourselves well able to hold
our own most anywhere

  is a - large enough for alaska is mackinaw
clothing suitable for the winter there if not what
is needed would  be enough to outfit both
of us for a summer and winter if not how much
would you suggest what foods are necessary to
keep a man in good condition in winter would
it be asking too much to have you explain what
clothing and food are really needed as we would like
to go as light as possible can maps be obtained
from the alaska bureau in seattle-ed j kim-
brough tompkins sask can

  answer by mr solomons-i hate to steal you
away from canada but alaska needs you and your
tillicum go up there by all means especially if
you can stay as long as you need to really make a
stake
ask adventure

   you may like that prespecting proposition but
any mathematician who also knows a little gold
statistics will tell you that your chance is one in a
thousand you can do far better mining after the
prospector ha struck it and a camp has grown up
around the place alining is a business prospecting
is a suckers dream however youre a prospector
and i know that breed too well having been one
myself for some years to imagine i can convert
him

   alaska has just been scratched a few big finds
have resulted in big camps which are getting worked
cut now but there are thriving small camps and
big ones due to be located any time besides the
other mineral deposits are only now being opened
up get in on the ground-floor right now i
usually discourage my correspondents from going
to alaska but in cases of obvious fitness i take the
other tack-as im doing with you

   the guggenheims have some big propositions up
there but they cut no figure in small mining at
all they simply dont count in the mass of the
industry

   i never advise taking an outfit from the states
 you can usually get what you need better on the
 spot-more suitable stult for instance if you took
 mackinaw clothing to the north or west coast any-
 where youd be out of luck but in the interior
 where the cold is still almost entirely its the clear
 quill and so with footwear and lots of things

   the local merchant gives you the stuff best for
 that locality besides youre not encumbered with
 an outfit in the place where you wish you were not
 if you aim for a particular locality and it is not close
 to a trading-post or even if it is and you know
 exactly your needs then its all right to take an
 outfit along otherwise not its usually other-
 wise

  food means the same as here-and plenty of
fresh when you can get it clothing ditto but
footwear is a little special otherwise same clothing
with the addition of a parkey to be had up there
footwear usually means a rubber-soled shoe-pack
or a gold seal short goodyear for summer fall
or spring and the eskimo or indian mukluk or
moccasin for dry weather in winter and german
socks in the interior and high mukluks and ordi-
nary socks in the winter on the coast the south
coast is jus an ordinary winter and ordinary maine
clothes would be warm enough or too warm

   but why waste time on all that go up there and
youll soon see unless your destination is mapped
out any specific directions would be useless

   yes the alaska bureau will give you maps or
bett er still the geological survey washington d c

the english-lion legend

two members of our editorial staff have
lived in the country discussed in the
subjoined correspondence but neither has
heard of the legend referred to can any-
body do anything to clear up the mystery

   question-first would you be kind enough to
inform me if you know of any english newspapers
now being published in mombasa or nairobi
were any of these papers or weeklies etc published
as far back as 

   i am seeking this information for the following

 reasons i need clippings to substantiate the fol-
 lowing story which is well-known in british east
 africa and which has been mentioned by visiting
 americans in books travel articles etc i however
 want the actual facts this is the story perhaps
 you too have heard it and can shed some light upon
 the facts

  between  and  a british adventurer
absconded with his regiments funds because of
some trouble with a superiors daughter and fled
to the bush here he lived with the natives and led
them in attacks upon the whites poached ivory
etc in one attack against the whites lieut dick
turned upon his native followers and fought with
the whites because there was a woman in the
safari he was killed-this happened in the kedong
valley-and was buried on the spot where he fell
the natives to this day call it the grave of the
english lion

  after his death it was learned that he was a
medal man it was hung on a string around his
neck he is supposed to have shot twenty natives
before his rifle jammed then slew several with his
rifle as a club i understand that a mound of
stones marks his grave he lived with the masai

  several people have told the story in various
fashions i need the real facts can you help me
out in any way or supgest some method or person
who can

   the story is authentic but i may have the name
wrong

   if you can help me i shall be everlastingly in-
debted to you and wish to thank you sincerely in
advance for any courtesies you may extend me in
this matter-s gordon gurwit chicago 

  answer by mr beadle-enclosed you will find
list of papers published in nairobi and mombasa
since 

  your story is very interesting indeed i was in
uganda from - but ive never heard the
yam-unfortunately for had i done so i should
certainly have used it in fiction

   i have repeatedly tried to get in touch with men
i knew there but everybody seems to have dis-
appeared or died as a suggestion you might try
the editor of the east african standard to give you
the truth of the tale i am very sorry i cant do
more quaintly enough im right in the middle of
a yam in which a fellow goes amuck with sunstroke
and turns against the whites whatever you try
in fiction fact if it can be found usually beats
you to it

raising game for the market

its legitimate enough though in some
states if not in all a permit to ship
must be obtained

  question-i read in the local paper recently
that the u s supreme court has ruled that it is
now legal to raise fowl and game for the market

   please advise if you know anything of this ruling
for instance could one raise quail in arizona and
ship them say to the california market

  enclosed herewith find postage for reply and
thanks very much for whatever information you
may be able to give-c b cravens florence
ariz


adventure

  answer by mr harriman-in re raising game for
the market it is just as legitimate as raising sheep
or hens or rabbits

  here in southern california men are raising trout
for the market and letting rabid anglers do fly-
casting in their ponds at so much a fish this they
do all the year round and nobody says nay

  to ship quail to market in this state you would
have to get written permission from your fish and
game commission to maintain your game farm
then you would have to have an agreement with
our commission on the shipping part satisfy our
commission that no illegally killed game would
enter the state i mean

  this will be harder to do for the commission
may think that such action would open the door to
poachers who kill out of season and who might
claim they bought domesticated quail outside our
state

  write to california fish and game commission
sacramento california ask them about this
matter then you are getting it right from the
men who have the authority it is a technical
cjuestion and can only be authoritatively answered
by the commission

pioneering in bolivia

the natural wealth is there and the
early birds will catch the biggest worms
but taking a family in is quite different from
going it alone

  question-i am very much interested about
raising sheep or cattle in bolivia

  could you give me any information which state
of bolivia is best suited for my purpose how is
the exchange of money at par or in favor of the
u s how much does it cost to go there and
which is the cheapest way

how much does it cost to live there what is
the price of shoes clothing compared with here

  how many indians negroes and half-breeds live
there is there any duty on hides and wool for
export

  how far is suitable land from the railroad and
what is the fare per mile or kilometer is any
timber on the land to build houses and stables or
corrals

  do you know how much it costs to have the land
surveyed by a government expert

  can you give me any information about im-
migration and land laws

  i wrote for the booklet to the pan-american
union it says you can buy  hectares
 acres at  cents a hectare but you must
settle one family on every  hectares on the
same page it says an immigrant can not possess
more than three lots or sections by purchase or
other means

  i have about  do you think it is enough
to start i have three boys eleven nine and six
years old and two girls-chas kloepper eddys-
bane can 

  answer by mr young-bolivia is an immense
country of some  to  square miles
very sparsely populated i will try to give you an
idea of what the surface area of this country is like
on the west is a range of mountains running north

and forming the boundary with part of chile and
peru about sixty to eighty miles east is another
range the plateau lying in between averages about
 feet above sea-level and the tops of the
mountains on each side run around  feet and
some of them up to 

   the eastern range-end nears the brazilian border
in the highest peaks of the andean chain and slopes
off into the lowlands of the upper amazon basin
the western chain continues on north through peru
and ecuador these mountains and high plateaus
comprise two-fifths of the total area of the republic

  east of the eastern range and north of the end
of this range the country slopes off down to tropical
country and in the extreme southeastern part it
slopes off into prairie country chaco thus it is
a case of finding the right altitude the temperate
zone is from  feet above sea-level up to 
the cold zone or puna region is from this on up
and the tropical zone is from  on down

   there is a portion of country lying in a triangle
roughly bounded on three sides by the cochabamba
misiones and oriental mountains that is called
the bolivian switzerland a country much broken
up and containing some of the most fertile valleysin
the whole world some of the towns in this region
are cochabamba tarata potosi san pedro and
sucre roughly speaking this country is some
 to  miles southeast of la paz the capital
there are other similar regions after crossing the
mountains and proceeding down on the eastern
slopes in other parts but this is a fairly well settled
country and its resources are known

  bolivia has an estimated population of some
 over half of whom are pure indians of
various tribes most of whom are tame and hard-
working quechuas thirteen per cent are white
twenty-six per cent are mixed white-indian a few
germans and other europeans in the mining regions
with three out of a thousand black-descended from
african slaves

  sheep are raised in the temperate zone with a
few raised in the lower part of the puna country at
some  elevation goats are raised in the
torrid country horse-raising was once a great
industry in the north and many are now raised in
the country near la paz mules are imported from
argentine by the mining companies

  cost of living depends on how you live if you
live off of native food and buy same in the public
markets you will be able to live cheaper than here
but if you buy imported food it will cost more than
here

  the markets afford plenty of beef both fresh
and salt mutton fruits potatoes yams etc

  write national city bank new york city for
present exchange rate i had a list but have mis-
placed it

   cost of clothing also varies the native people
especially the rural people make a sort of cloth
from llama wool which is heavy and coarse and very
suitable for the highlands for the temperate zones
they wear linen and cotton suits which cost little

  bolivia was once a free-trade country and i am
not up on the present duties either outgoing or
incoming i know they do tax some of the products
especially outgoing rubber and sugar the bureau
of foreign and domestic commerce washington
d c should be able to quote such duties

   the fare used to be something like  from the
coast up to la paz there has been a new line built
lost trails



which strikes the coast at arica peru and makes a
shorter trip of it i do not know what the fare is
on this road at present as all fares have increased
greatly since the european war

  the fare on the steamers has also increased
greatly it used to be  to mollendo but it is
around  now first-class

  you have quite a family and this undertaking
is a pioneer job the first few in there have the
benefit if the country ever does come to the front
which it will no doubt do sometime i had a letter
three years ago from a man who had gone down
and carved out a home far in the interior and
was well satisfied i wish i had not mislaid his
letter

  but brother it is as near being out of the whole
world as a man can get dont you think you could
do your pioneering in a country that wouldnt be
so hard to get to

  there is some mighty fine country in the high-
lands of central america i know you liave the
sand and grit to do the job with in bolivia but

when you talk boys and girls to me it sort of takes
the heart out of me i sure dont want to see you
make a mistake

  with the money you have by going down there
and looking around even working for some of the
tin-mines or railroads until you are sure you see
the country you are looking for keeping your
money a secret to yourself and then grabbing
off a boundary of land from the government you
could turn the trick but make sure all the way
along shes a country that is primitive and there
are thousands of miles that are virgin country and
that will produce anything

  the native indians are humble and tame except
a few wild tribes in the yery eastern part and there
would be no danger to your family and by locating
in one of the smaller towns they would not be
lonely but carving out a home in the wilderness is
a pioneer job as i have said

  see the encyclopedia britannica in some library
and take a look at bolivia for a general geographical
sketch

cutting a colgate refill in the handy grip

                                             is like putting a new blade in a razor-easy and
                                             simple the soap itself is threaded to screw into
                                             the socket there is no waste

                                       with convenience and economy you get
comfort also in shaving with colgates the
softening lather needs no mussy rubbing in with
the fingers it leaves your face cool and refreshed

colgates shaving stick not only produces the
most soothing lather for the average man but it
is a little more economical in use than powder
and much more economical than shaving cream
aj we make all three we can give you this im-
partial advice

colgate sc co

dept c

 fulton street new york

        the metal handy crip  containing a trial size slick of
        colgates shaving soap will be sent for c when the trial
        stick is used up you can bu the colgate refillsthreaded to
        fit this grip thus you save i oc on each refill you buy

        there are  shaves in a colgate shaving stick-double the
        number you can get from a tube of cream at the same price
