an impromptu conspiracy

the astounding abduction of john roberts on his way to join the woman who is to become
his wife-what came of a chance meeting on a railroad journey-the part
played by hypnotism in the pursuit of the conspirators

complete in this issue

chapter i-a swiftly conceived plot

dig bluff ji roberts en route from chicago to new york stopped at
buffalo for some business reason intending to continue his journey by
the next train but  the street he accidentally encountered an acquaintance
he had not seen for three or four years a shrewd looking ferret faced little
fellow-ernest mettre- the intimacy between the two men had never
amounted to more than mere acquaintanceship and roberts had at one time
a suspicion that the frenchman-as mettre professed himself-was something
of a scamp nevertheless some scamps are amusing interesting and enjoy
the fortune therefore of being leniently tolerated by easy going men of the
world who happen to have no personal ground of complaint against them

   mettre was one of that kind and roberts would have needed to be more
churlish than was his nature not to have reciprocated in some degree the
effusive warmth of welcome with which he was greeted and indeed he
really knew nothing against the little-man bven his vague suspicion was
only second hand and not a feeling likely to find permanent lodgment in
his kindly heart

   in the course of their conversation mettre soon learned that mr roberts
had closed out all his large lumber interests in the west and was on his way
to the metropolis presumably to find some better investment for his capital
though he did not exactly say so

    why   exclaimed mettre  i also am just about going to new york
if you wait over until tomorrow we can go on together

 idid intend taking tonights train mr roberts replied hesitatingly

   i would not think of deranging your plans if i could get my wife
started on such notice  but you know how women are she could not pos-
sibly be ready before tomorrow and i would like to have your company
what are a few hours to you any way  wait over and let us go together
im sure it would please my wife very much

     a

       


an impromptu conspiracy

    i did not know you were married

    no well i never have made parade of my domestic affairs my wife
is one of the best women in the world but a liomekeeping little body and
i have always been disposed to keep my home life and my affairs among men
quite apart the domestic hearth is sacred to me i suppose you will think
me a sentimental frenchman for saying so but that is my way

    indeed i think better of you for it than i ever did before answered
john roberts bluntly  happy the man should be who has a home life i
have had none since the death of my parents when i was a lad i dont
even know that i have relatives nearer than forty second cousins whom i
have not heard of for a dozen years

    yet you go on all the time working hard to get yourself more rich
why 

    primarily from habit i suppose a habit acquired when it was a
necessity of existence and wealth may come handy by and by i guess it
will his voice took a softer tone and there was a dreamy expression in
his eyes as he uttered that expectation of the future

      come    said mettre urgently  say that you will wait over and dine
with me i have set my heart upon our dining together it shall be as you
like either we will go and have a formal feast in grand style at the club
or we will take our chances of what madame mettre will be able to give us at
my home

      my preference certainly would be for the latter  

    is it so  then you are a man of heart like me and perhaps we shall
not be the worse off madame mettre knows well how to keep the house
and though we live plainly it is not badly

   mr roberts ended by resigning himself to the program arranged by his
chance companion whom lie accompanied to his home a small but well
furnished cottage a little way out from the busy portion of the city madame
mettre met with his approval without being really pretty her features
were pleasing and brightened up agreeably in the animation of conversation
in the dining room where the light was stronger he fancied that her eyes had
rather a hard steely glitter and that her lips seemed thinner and straighter
than would be expected as indicative of perfect amiability but that roberts
reflected philosophically was a matter that need concern nobody but her hus-
band

   the dinner was plain but good and passed off quite pleasantly when
mr roberts took his leave it was arranged that the mettres should call for
him the next morning at the hotel where he had elected to spend the night
and they would go to the station together

   at the appointed hour their carriage-with a big new trunk strapped be-
hind-stopped at the hotel door where he waited valise in hand and taking
him up went on roberts was unaware that the new trunk bore upon the
end turned away from him as the carriage stopped at the curb a large
black letter  r not an  m as would naturally have been expected

   when they reached the station m mettre said   will you be so good
as to see madame to the waiting room while i look after the baggage  of
an impromptu conspiracy



course mr roberts did so and the husband disappeared in a few moments
he returned to them in haste saying   the train is due and i have to see
to the weighing of that trunk i fear it is over weight my dear here is
madames ticket mr roberts and here the ticket for a section of the parlor
car that i have taken that we may sit together in comfort you will kindly
see madame aboard if i am delayed  thanks  now i go again to that
blessed trunk and once more he ran away

   so it was that when the train rolled in mr roberts went aboard with the
lady who clung very closely to him because as she said the noise and bustle
all about made her nervous and the porter who conducted him to the en-
gaged section naturally supposed them a married couple that was also the
impression in the mind of the parlor car conductor who took up the section
ticket and in that of the train conductor who punched together the two
tickets tendered to him by mr roberts one a lay over and the other a
 through to new york not until after that did m mettre put in his ap-
pearance his ticket had been punched in the smoking car where he had
gone to soothe his nerves with a cigarette after his annoyance with the over
weight trunk

   during the day the trio remained together chatting reading newspapers
dining and supping yet in all that time  one in the car would have sus-
pected from madame mettres manner that she belonged to the little man or
from his demeanor that he was anything more than a friend night had
fallen when the two men went to the smoking compartment and the lady
comfortably nestled in a big arm chair seemed to fall asleep while looking
out upon the hudson the train was nearing spuyten duyvil when roberts
and mettre found themselves the sole occupants of the smoking room and the
latter remarked 	

    we will soon arrive and as it may be chilly passing from this hot car
to the night air would it not be a good idea for us to take a little prudential
dose of brandy-now

    not a half bad idea replied roberts reaching toward the electric
button to summon the porter

   no do not do that interposed the frenchman  i will get rosas
flask she always carries a little brandy for medicinal purposes and i am
sure it is very much better than any we would be likely to get from the
buffet he went out and in a few moments returned bringing a small
silver flask and a glass of water he had drawn from the cooler as his hand
covered the flask it could not have been seen by any one that the oval silver
cup covering its lower half did not fit closely but was held full half an inch
below its proper place

   mettre gave the glass of water to his companion thus depriving him of
the use of one hand for manipulation of the flask then as he himself had
both hands free it was quite natural that he should unscrew the cap take
the cup from the bottom and pour into it the brandy for his friend uttering
as he did so the time honored western query say when

   when ejaculated roberts and mettre handed him the cup the
big man drank the contents poured into the cup some water from the glass


an impromptu conspiracy

and drank that then the frenchman took the cup poured from the flask
into it and took his drink with a sip afterward from the glass which he then
returned to its place in the rack beside the cooler mr roberts sank into a
comfortable angle of the well padded sofa and mettre pocketing the flask
seated himself in a chair

     do you know where you will put up   asked the latter

    at the fifth avenue i suppose i generally go there he went on
talking or trying to talk but drowsiness seemed mastering him his words
came slowly were disconnected presently ceased altogether and he sank back
in torpor the frenchman glanced at the door to see that they were still
alone then reached forward and shook his companions shoulder called his
name and lifted one of his eyelids to see the dull unconscious stare that was
like a dead mans the conclusive evidence of perfect insensibility satisfied
of his condition mettre with deft skilful fingers drew from the pockets of
the corpse like sleeper his baggage checks keys a big well filled wallet and
even a roll of bills then with a triumphant smile he settled himself in his
chair and also seemed to sleep hardly had he so disposed himself when the
conductor entered passed him and shook mr roberts lightly saying  your
wife wishes to see you sir

   mettre affecting to be awakened by the intrusion sat up asking dazedly
hello whats the matter where are we he spoke like one still
confused by sleep

   just entering the tunnel sir answered the conductor the lady
wishes to see her husband  

   oh jack i say jack  your wife wants you cried the french-
man reaching forward and shaking his companion but without effect
 why   he exclaimed  something seems to be tfee matter with him  he
has fainted  call his wife

   the conductor hastened to summon the woman who came running to the
door of the smoking room and at sight of the victim shrieked then fell upon
her knees beside him crying oh my poor husband he has had
another stroke  

chapter ii-the strange intuitions of ethel holly

   three years prior to the incidents just narrated john roberts a prosper-
ous lumber dealer in chicago found himself compelled to go into the lime and
cement trade he had taken for a bad debt a couple of lime kilns fancying
that he would be able to dispose of them readily at the low valuation he put
upon them but no purchaser appeared and as he was too good a business
man to let a productive plant lie idle he kept it going and made it pay
but the occupation was distasteful to him he knew nothing- about lime and
cement and didnt want to the semi retail character of the trade annoyed
him waiting for petty orders and filling them took too much of his time
for all the profit there was in them and he rued the unlucky day in which he
first became a lime kiln man

   that was only in the beginning however eater he learned to look back
an impromptu conspiracy

s

upon it as a red letter day one of tlie happiest of his life yet there had not
while his views were undergoing that transformation been any change in the
business to make it any more enjoyable

   deck brown said to him one morning when urging him to leave his office
and go duck shooting down on the grand calumet  youre a fool to stay
here and do the work of a ten dollar a week clerk just for all there is in
your blamed lime and cement business but for that you could go as you
pleased for theres nothing doing in lumber at this season get a clerk

   good yes ill hire a young man tomorrow 

    well i dont know that id hire a young man how does the idea of
a typewriter girl strike you   

     unfavorably  

   ah thats because you havent considered it lets do so now
there isnt occupation here enough for a man lonesome idleness would
drive him to hard drink and if he knew jou were out of town he would prob-
ably spend most of his time over in brunswicks playing billiards but a girl
you could depend upon staying right here to receive orders and fill them
she would find plenty of occupation fixing her hair and reading novels and
playing solitaire under the raised lid of her desk she would get your letters
out in modern style and would not be likely to pick up pointers about your
business and give them away her presence would temper the gaiety of
speech among the boys who might drop in to see you and improve the moral
atmosphere and viewed as an office decoration you know no young man
will stand comparison with even a moderately pretty girl

   that will do deck i give in and will advertise for a typewriter
tomorrow  

   so he did and received a peck of applications for the place half a dozen
of the letters he selected as more promising than the others but among them
he could make no choice and the thought of a personal selection involving
telling several young women they would not do was too appalling to be
entertained a happy idea occurred to him numbering the letters consec-
utively he put corresponding numbers in his hat drew out one and in sub-
missive obedience to fate wrote to  no   requesting her to call

    at his first sight of  no   roberts felicitated himself that he had not
drawn some other number she was a tall slender girl with delicate features
her complexion was of singular purity and her large liquid eyes of hazel
tint had the strange look of serious innocence seldom seen except in the eyes
of young children

   ethel holly was the name she gave she was an orphan had learned
phonography and typewriting as a means of self support and had  practical
experience this being the first position for which she had ventured to
make application would she be satisfied with a salary of ten dollars a week 
it was more she feared than her services would be worth john roberts
thought to himself it would be worth that just to see her around but merely
said he would not think of paying less and the poor girls expressive face
showed such happiness in her good fortune that roberts secretly wished he
had named a higher figure


an impromptu conspiracy

   the next morning ethel entered upon her simple duties which she com-
prehended at once and discharged with conscientious fidelity she is a
jewel   said john roberts to himself  a paragon  she even spells cor-
rectly  

   one thing in her manner puzzled him a little at first whenever she was
suddenly addressed or when a stranger entered the office abruptly a look of
alarm would spring into her eyes as if instinct prompted her to flight like a
doe in the forest at the sound of a hunters tread  but in a second the ex-
pression would vanish and she would stand firmly collected with heightened
color her mental faculties fully alert and showing a little frown upon her
brow a physical expression of the reproof her courageous soul was admin-
istering to her timid nerves gradually that timidity wore off but she
always manifested an exquisite sensitiveness to impressions from those who
came near her a psychic consciousness that sometimes astonished her
employer when he had so far won her confidence as to be made aware of it

   one of her earliest manifestations of that capacity was when one ernest
mettre appeared with a rather tempting business project in which he desired
to enlist a considerable capital mr roberts thought well of the scheme
sufficiently well at least to take it into serious consideration and would
probably have engaged in it but for what seemed to him afterward when he
thought it over a rather singular incident m mettre had gone and the
lumber merchant sat cogitating when suddenly he felt impelled to ask of the
silent girl at her desk on the other side of the room  what do you think
of him

   miss holly started turned recovered herself and flushed all in au in-
stant as usual but replied promptly   he is not to be trusted

     did you hear what he proposed   

    not a word

    well what did you see in him to give you that idea  

    i saw nothing beyond a glance as he entered i did not look at him
i did not need to his presence made me feel that he is designing and un-
scrupulous i knew it

     oh  then you knew something about him before  

    absolutely nothing i was not even aware of his existence

   mr roberts thoughtfully scratched his head he had met mettre a year
or two before among men who spoke of him as a sharp jolly little fellow
but their acquaintance had never been intimate beyond a rather shifty eye
the frenchman had so far as he had seen no visible points on which to base
such emphatic condemnation yet something told him ethels judgment
was to be trusted and he resolved to decline the proposed enterprise which
as events proved within a few months was a fortunate decision

    do you often have impressions about persons in that way miss holly 
he asked her	

    almost always she replied

   he thought he would very much like to know what her impression of
him had been but did not venture to ask and assured himself that if it
hadnt been up to a pretty fair average she would not have remained long a
an impromptu conspiracy



reflection that not only gave him a great deal of satisfaction but was
eminently correct as later events will show

chapter iii-john roberts love affair

   at the end of a fortnight miss hollys conscience troubled her she
could not see that she was earning the salary she received or indeed that mr
roberts needed help his letters few in number were models of brevity
and could all be written by himself in fifteen minutes  hardly anybody came
in except  errands about lime or cement and she had unconsciously im-
bibed from her employer a contempt and dislike for that branch of his busi-
ness and these facts she set forth to him with customary frankness in
support of a suggestion that he could dispense with her services

   he looked at her with surprise and a feeling near akin to alarm she
should not go away if he could prevent it he said to himself

    indeed mr roberts she continued  i feel as if my staying here is
dishonest as if i were taking something for nothing

   your standard of honesty would make a man feel lonesome in business
nowadays he replied drily  among the speculators anyway but lets
see if you are useless you saw that man from ontonagon the day before
yesterday didnt you

   yes sir

    and explained what i told you about why i had made that change in
shipments   

     i believe so

    and he went away satisfied 

      he seemed to be  

if he had seen me we would have quarreled if i had written he
would have sued me for he is a cantankerous litigious crank your pretty
way of putting facts disarmed him and made him listen to reason you saved
me more than two or three months of your salary just by that one service
 oh  i didnt think of it in that light

 well i did you are all right only im afraid you find it rather dull

here dont you 

     it isnt very lively sometimes

    why dont you read something 

    i was told by the woman who taught me typewriting that employers
did not like to see girls reading books in business hours

    such men are brutes like those who will not allow a tired shop girl to
sit down and rest even when she has nothing to do  but they are in the
minority i hope bring any books you like  do anything you please to kill
time

   she thanked him very gratefully for the days had indeed been long and
dull when she felt compelled by a sense of duty to sit with folded hands
through the weary hours thereafter as mr roberts soon noticed she seemed
to be n arsing a mystery always when he entered the office if she hap-
pened to be alone as she generally was he found her in the act of shutting


an impromptu conspiracy

down tlie lid of lier desk a book lay beside her but his keen eyes noted
that she got through it very slowly evidently the desk concealed what she
had chosen for beguiling the time of course he did not think of endeavoring
to pry into her affairs but his curiosity was awakened and he was ready to
welcome any purely accidental occurrence that would enlighten him

   the opportunity came one abominable day when the deep mud in the
streets had caused him to don rubber overshoes his steps approaching the
office were noiseless and he entered to find miss holly so deeply engaged that
she was unaware of his presence until he stood at her elbow

   she was working upon a water color drawing of autumn leaves a charming
study of soft browns dull gold and somber tints of crimson relieved by vivid
scarlet splashes

    oh   he exclaimed  i did not know you were an artist

   i ah  mr roberts  you are making fun of my little daubing
making fun no indeed it is beautiful not only in its effects of
color but its fidelity to nature it is very good  

   the girls face showed the pleasure his generous appreciation gave her as
she replied it is simply copying

   oh  a copy he rejoined and his voice had a little tone of disappoint-
ment

   yes of this she replied taking out of her desk a bunch of leaves
in the arrangement of which he recognized at once the original of her picture
his face brightened and it was in quite a different tone that he said  ah 
a copy from nature he studied her work with more care comparing it
with its model

    you must have been studying a good while he said

    i could scarcely call it studying she replied  i never took a
lesson i could not afford it but one day i picked up an old coverless
book of instructions in the use of water colors as soon as i could i bought
a box of block paints tubes have been beyond my reach

    have you any more of your work here 

   only a few crude pencil sketches she replied reluctantly showing a
sketch book he admired them also but she with a truer perception of art
shook her head saying   my drawing is sadly defective i have naturally
a good eye for color-as most women have i believe-and that seems easy 
but form is hard for that i wall never be worth anything without instruc-
tion i fear

   nothing more was said on the subject at that time when ethel had
finished her autumn leaves to her satisfaction she gave it to herem-
ployer as a christmas present and received from him a box of the best tube
colors such as she had hopelessly coveted ever since she began to use paints

   just before the building season commenced in the spring mr roberts
found a purchaser for his lime kilns and had agreed upon terms of sale before
it occurred to him that parting with them would deprive him of all reasonable
excuse for keeping a typewriter particularly one so conscientious about ser-
vice as ethel holl she certainly would not remain with him if she saw
that he had no wtork for her to do there was something lie had intended
an impromptu conspiracy



saying to her he had had it in mind ever so long-at least ever since
christmas-and had been restrained from its utterance by the doubt that he
might seem to be presuming unduly upon his position as her employer and
that she taking offense would go away and it would be even worse for
him to say it after selling the kilns which would deprive her of occupation
for it might enter her head that he was trying to take advantage of her neces-
sities

   the fact was-though he did not recognize it-he deceived himself in
fancying those fantastic considerations of exaggerated delicacy held him in
check the plain truth was that he too greatly feared losing the girl by a
premature avowal of his love in business he never hesitated or temporized
because there he felt sure of his ground but love was a new field to him
however after a good deal of cogitation he thought he saw before him a
safe honorable and measurably hopeful line of conduct and when he had
it well settled in his mind he proceeded upon it at once

   primarily he get rid of the kilns then under the guise of dictating a
letter he acquainted miss holly with what he had done furtively watching
while she took notes he saw her turn pale and when she took up her note
book her hand trembled his heart smote him with remorse for the pain she
suffered and he longed to take her in his arms and tell her that transferred
ownership of all the lime kilns in the world need not affect her happiness for
an instant

   when she brought to him for signature the typewritten copy of the letter
he remarked in an off hand way- wiping out the lime business will leave
little for you to do miss holly

   i do not see that it will leave anything sir she answered i have

known all along that i was very little use and-

   no he interrupted bruskly youre wrong there you have been
well worth the little i have paid you but as you were  doubt about to
say there will be practically nothing more for you to do

    would you object to my receiving here she replied  during the rest
of this week answers to an advertisement for another situation and to my
refering to you  

   i dont think i could consent to either under the circumstances i
have something else in view for you that i think will be better

   her dumb surprise quite equalled his anticipations any show of senti-
mentality he feared would excite her alarm and suspicion of ulterior pur-
pose but if he could hold himself in check and keep the discussion near a
business basis he believed he would have his way in the end he went on
 you cannot do more than peck a bare living out of this typewriting and
for various reasons it isnt the sort of thing i would like to see you con-
demned to for the rest of your life i have heard you say you would like to
study art and i have  doubt it is about the best thing a girl can take up if
she has talent for it as i believe you have my confidence in your ability is
sufficient for me to make you a straight business proposition i will advance
two thousand dollars to enable you to go to new york and study in fact i
may say i have already put that amount to your credit in a new york bank


an impromptu conspiracy

 dont understand that as your limit simply as a starter whatever more
 you require will be provided i mean to make an artist of you and do not
 intend that you shall be pinched and i would like to have you start as soon
 as possible of course i would have preferred to have  u stay in chicago
 where i could see how you get along but the prospects for n art education
 here i dont find encouraging here is a letter of introduction to what i am
 told by an artist friend is the best school in new york and jrour tuition there
 is already paid for a year in advance and-i believe thats all

    he had begun speaking in a cool deliberate way but hurried more and
 more as he went on until he was going like an auctioneer fearing that she
 would interrupt and interpose some objection before he should have con-
 clusively shown her how completely everything was settled and made her
 feel that she could do nothing but acquiesce when he stopped he was out
 of breath

    grateful emotion overpowered the girl she bowed her head upon her
 arms on the desk before her and wept exclaiming oh how good you
 are  

     then when recovering her self control she tried to thank him he would
 have none of it but spoke lightly of what he had done as if it had been a
 small matter seeing her so grateful and innocently glad of the new hope he
 had given her he was sorely tempted to draw from her some word of promise

- or at least of hope for himself something that would be a remembrance for
 her when she should be far away where other men would find her fair but
 his true heart still held him firm  she shall go free he thought  and if
 i am not kept in her mind without words i shall have done well to remain
 silent

    so she went from him-and his heart went with her

chapter iv-covering the trail

    the train was coming to a stop in the grand central station when john
 roberts condition was discovered and in the confusion incident to its arrival
 hardly anybody took notice of the removal of the insensible man from the
 parlor car by a couple of the train crew they lifted him into the high
 wheeled chair kept for such emergencies then two of the station men trundled
 the chair through one of the waiting rooms to the police station under the
 vanderbilt avenue side of the depot building the mettres walking on
 each side of tlie chair and supporting the mans head protested that they
 did not want him taken to a police station they wished to put him into
 a carriage and hurry home the men turned deaf ears to their remonstrances
 established rules governed their action under all contingencies and they were
 educated to deny themselves the luxury of thinking when on duty an
 unconscious man brought in by a train must be turned over to the police
 that would end their responsibilit- in the matter and their interest

     at the head of the steps leading down to the station house ernest mettre
 unobservedly slipped into his wifes hand the baggage checks he had taken
 from roberts pocket and she dropped them into her little satchel divining


an impromptu conspiracy	

instantly what they were and the use she would have to make of them in
support of her role as the stricken mans wife she was crying softly the
sergeant at the desk said to her soothingly calm yourself raadame he
will be all right ill ring for a hospital ambulance and it will be here in ten
minutes

   i will not have my husband taken to a hospital   she cried he
would be killed there  our family physician must attend him nobody else
understands his case he has had such spells before i will not let him go
to a hospital to be murdered   then apparently growing hysterical  
must take him home  i must take him home   she shrieked

   m mettre ably supported her demand averring that as an old friend of
the family he knew the gentleman to be liable to such attacks as the present
if the sergeant would be so good as to have a carriage called he would be
responsible for getting his friend home safely and in evidence of his good
faith he gave his personal card after writing on the back of it the address
of his friends residence

   the sergeant was easily convinced willing to assent almost to anything
to get a hysterical woman out of the station and as the sick mans friends
wished to take him in charge  good reason appeared to the official mind
why they should not do so in his presence while a policeman went out to
summon a hack the lady took some baggage checks from her satchel and
handed them to the friend saying will you kindly see to having our
trunks put on the carriage this check is for one we brought with us to-
day-a new one with a large  r  on the end the others were sent ahead
and will be in yesterdays arrivals he made haste to comply with her re-
quest could you oblige me with a piece of ice a flat bit as big as your
hand she asked turning to the sergeant who readily procured it she
folded it in the sick mans big silk handkerchief which she took from his
coat pocket and bound it  top of his head

     there she said  that is all the doctor himself could do for him at
present the sergeant admired her presence of mind

    presently the hack appeared with three trunks strapped on its rack and
when the distressed wife and friend had entered it with their torpid charge drove
off rapidly when a few blocks away from the depot m mettre put his head
out of a window and told the driver to stop the lady he said had thought
of a drug store where they would be likely at this hour to find the family
physician and she wished to seek him there before going home he gave an
address to the driver who again started his horses at a smart trot in the new
direction

    the next stop was at the curb before a small drug store on a narrow east
side street tall jars of colored fluids through which lights glared red and
green and blue made the shop conspicuous but it was hardly possible to
look into it from the street so completely were its windows and glass doors
obscured by bottles and packages of goods patent medicine cards pictures
and repeated signs  botica espanol deutsche apotheke  and  pliar-
macie francaise 

   mettre sprang to the sidewalk and ran into the store whence he soon


an impromptu conspiracy

returned with a little lean baldheaded frenchman the proprietor speaking
to the lady in the carriage so loudly that the driver could hear every word
he said   it is yet too early for the doctor he is among his patients no
one knows where and will not be here for half an hour

    even then she replied  we would have him sooner than by going
home and waiting there

    that is what i thought put in mettre  and the druggist says he
knows your husband and can do all that is necessary for him now he
should be put to bed at once with a bag of pounded ice on his head and not
moved again tonight the doctor will bleed him

      but can he stay- here   

    yes the druggist will give up his bed to him

    then there is nothing else to be done we must get him inside but
what about the trunks  

    you might go home with them

    and leave my husband indeed i will not

    well then have them brought in i have no doubt the apothecary will
find a place for them

     if so that arranges everything  

   in a few minutes the insensible form of john roberts was laid upon
the grimy tumbled bed in the druggists back room  the trunks were put
behind the prescription desk and the driver pleased by the receipt of a
dollar in addition to the full fare he would have received had he gone to
his primary destination went away satisfied that his fares were very nice
persons as soon as he was out of sight mettre quickly left the place

   the little druggist looked at the woman with a shrewd grin and remarked
in french   it is a good affair i suppose

    how do i know  she replied it is that of ernest and what does
he tell me

   the frenchman grinned again and with an elaborate bow and in a tone
slightly sarcastic responded to perspicacity such as that of the ever
charming madame rosa explanations would be superfluous then he
regaled himself with a pinch of snuff and said meditatively  as for me
the older i become the less affection do i feel for the taking of serious risks
a modest trade in the most popular engravings of the country affords me
excitement enough

    anything new  

    in a couple of weeks there will be some s  superb  of detection im-
possible you will admire them

   she borrowed a sponge and with a little water quickly effaced the large
r from the end of her trunk neither of them seemed to give a
thought to the man who lay as if dead in the back room

   a rough looking fellow wearing a slouch hat and a hackmans long over-
coat entered abruptly glanced sharply around and said  make haste now
and let us get him out it was mettre so well disguised that even his
wife had not recognized him at a first glance with as little care in hand-
ling as if he had been a sack of meal the two men and the woman carried
an impromptu conspiracy



john roberts out and tumbled him into a ramshackle hack at the door
then they loaded he trunks on behind mettre climbed up on the box rosa
got in with their victim and they drove off

   the vehicle was one of the regular   nighthawk   type with dingy
lamps and indistinct number but the horses before it were good and went
swiftly mettre had known where to get exactly the outfit he wanted from
a man whose specialty it was to have ready at all hours day and night
horses and vehicles of various sorts with or without drivers for hire to
persons who were willing to pay large prices instead of answering questions
about their affairs nearly all this persons queer business was carried on at
night sometimes his patrons hard pressed by the police had to abandon
valuable goods in his vehicles the police took the goods and found out of
what burglary they were the proceeds but the horses and wagons went back
to their owner who simply had to claim that they had been stolen from him

   mettre crossed the east river to hunters point and drove out to a little
frame cottage of shabby appearance standing isolated in a desert waste of
ground in that very remote section of brooklyn having by great ex-
ertions lugged roberts and the trunks into that repellent looking shelter he
started off again to return the hack to its owner at a point agreed upon near
the ferry on the new york side in a little while he recrossed the river to
hunters point ori foot and no longer in disguise

   as he stood on the after deck of the boat leaning on the rail and smoking
a cigar he smiled in self approbation over the neatness with which he had
 done the job it was something of a feat he reflected to take possession
of a big strong man in a parlor car of a wtell filled train  pluck him from
the hands of the police  capture his baggage  carry it and him off together
in triumph and leave no more trail for his pursuers to follow than if his flight
had been down into the sea

   and that is what he had done-with some help from rosa of course but
on his plan alone with the hackmans aid they might be traced to the drug
store but pierre would know nothing he had good reasons of his own for
not encouraging t ie inquisitiveness of the police and from there nobody
could track them john roberts was his to do with as he pleased what
would he do with him 

chapter v-the letters that breathed danger

   the night was cold and rosa mettre had humanity enough to throw a rug-
over the stupefied man but beyond that nothing was done for him she had
no reason to apprehend a fatal result from the drug her husband had given
him others she knew had lived through the experience alarming as it
seemed and of course he would some time the next day or night he
would struggle to feeble consciousness with a headache almost as bad as
death and if simply let alone would probably recover entirely-if he had a
strong constitution-in a few weeks if it should be necessary to keep him
fuiet longer by giving him another dose before he would be quite awake-
veil that might be bad for him but that was ernests affair not hers


an impromptu conspiracy

   while awaiting her husbands return she amused herself by searching
roberts pockets and ransacking his valise in the latter she found a pack-
age of fifteen government bonds of the value of one thousand dollars each
it was a pretty sum she reflected in itself well worth all the risks they had
taken-if one could only be sure the numbers were not registered somewhere
would it be safe to conceal them from ernest  hardly he probably knew
of them and even if he did not she doubted her ability to dispose of them
safely without his aid or subsequent knowledge no she would have to give
them to him and take chances on getting her share ernest would no
doubt act square with her

   in roberts vest pocket she found a package of letters written by a woman
methodically arranging them in the order of their dates and so reading them
she soon found herself deeply interested in the tender romance they pro-
gressively revealed but before she finished their perusal she was thrilled by
vague alarm she awakened to a sense of danger from some mysterious
cause all the more to be dreaded because it was indefinite unknown yet as
she felt convinced none the less real

   all the letters were signed  ethel and she noted while opening and
arranging them that though the earlier ones were addressed to  dear mr
roberts those of later date were written to  dear john rosas experi-
ences had not been such as to nourish the sentimental element in her nature
or develop whatever sympathy for innocence and goodness she possibly
possessed in infancy yet she was a woman and the awakening of a heart
revealed in that correspondence touched her

   innocent gratitude to a benefactor breathed from every page in the open-
ing chapters of the ingenuous story all the hopes and fears and small suc-
cesses and the little details of daily life were narrated by the writer with the
artless simplicity of a child addressing herself to an affectionate father
almost imperceptibly the tone grew more tender filial regard gradually
gave place to a feeling warmer yet none the less pure then one letter stood
out by itself the outpouring of the soul of the awakened and conscious
woman who writes her willing acceptance of a mans proffered love it was
so tender and beautiful in its womanliness that rosa read it over a second
time and even found her eyes moisten with sympathy then she read on and
enjoj-ed the rest of the missives delightful love letters ardent as one could
expect from an innocent young girl and here little by little came to the
surface the new element that as has been said awoke madame mettres
apprehension in one she read

    you forget the text  where the treasure is there will the heart be also
i do not think it strange that i seem to see rou when you an so far from me
for you are ever present in my thoughts and it is my heart that sees you  

   in another she found

    i am impressed that you concluded last night the negotiation for the sale
of your lumber interests to a tall dark man who had big black whiskers and
you were not in your office but in his room in a hotel and when you parted
it was to meet again today at your office to complete the transaction tell
me if i am right  

                                                             
an impromptu conspiracy	

   the next and last answered the mans reply to the preceding

   so i was right in every particular and you affect to be afraid of my
ability to see you ah  dear john i know too well how good you are to
believe in your fear and you are coming to new york soon how happy
i shall be

   a single telegram was bunched with the letters

    be very careful some great danger threatens you tell no one when
you start

    this young woman said rosa to herself  is enough to give one the
creeps a girl such as she divined this one to be strong in love intelligence
and courage gifted with some mysterious power the nature and limitations
of which the frenchwoman could only dimly conjecture was a person to be
seriously taken into account she wished that she knew who ethel was and
where to find her adversaries unknown and in the dark are those most to
be feared

   while madame mettre pondered she heard her husband at the doorand
went to meet him with a light he came in stamping his feet and showering
profuse maledictions upon the mud through which he had to wade

    and to think he complained  that cold and tired as i am i cannot
put my feet to the fire and rest but must take off my coat and dig like a
laborer

    where will you dig ernest and what  asked his wife in surprise

    in the cellar-a grave

chapter vi-tracking the abductors

   ethel holey was suffering an agony of anxious apprehension when
she sent that telegram to john roberts the day before he left chicago
what the peril threatening him might be she could not see but of its reality
she was fully assured and she felt dimly that if harm came to him it would
be through some one knowing in advance that he was going to new york
and he had too much well founded regard for her impressions to treat them
lightly

   he not only immediately telegraphed a reply that he would tell no one he
was about to start for the east and would take more than ordinary pre-
cautions for safety but he repeated his assurances in a letter which he
calculated should reach her a few hours in advance of his arrival it was a
long loving letter meant to dispel her anxiety and he even affected much
more jocosity than lie felt in rejecting the idea of danger  to show you
he wrote  that i am now absolutely safe i inclose an accident insurance
policy the company issuing it is so notoriously lucky that nothing ever
happens to one of its policy holders so you see i shall be safe for at least a
week to come and as i shall be with my guardian angel before that time is
up my security stretches far out into the indefinite future  

   but the secrecy with which according to promise he shrouded his de-
parture from chicago prevented his sending word to a buffalo man with
whom he had business relations that he was going east and as it was im-
	an impromptu conspiracy

portant that the man should be so informed he deemed it necessary to stop over
for the sole purpose of seeing him thus excess of caution brought his fate
upon him it did not occur to him that reserve concerning his journey was
any longer necessary when he had got so far from chicago as buffalo

   from a way station soon after leaving chicago and again from buffalo
he had telegraphed to ethel that he was on his way after that she heard
nothing more from him

   when he failed to arrive by the train on which she expected him she was
not surprised even his telegrams en route had not dispelled the black cloud
of depression that seemed to overhang her spirits growing denser as the
lagging hours crawled by she was prepared for the worst and from his
silence and unexplained absence deemed it had befallen

   late in the evening of the day upon which he was brought to the city
she felt that she could no longer endure inaction and went to the grand
central station to inquire if any accident had happened to a train from the
west that had not been reported in the evening newspapers she was told
there had been none  that the train had got in on time eventually an ex-
ceptionally intelligent porter whom she encountered remembered that a
gentleman who was taken sick on the western express hfd been carried to
the police station and kindly showed her where that was

   the sergeant at the desk was the same one who was on duty when the
insensible man was brought in there in response to her inquiries he said 
yes a man whose name wras given as john roberts had an apoplectic
stroke on the train  was taken away by his wife to his resilience

    his wife   ethel exclaimed  he has no wife

   i guess youre mistaken maybe its not the man you are looking
for  

    please describe him

    a big framed man not lean but with no loose flesh on him brown
hair  smooth shaved but for a long brown mustache  couldnt see his eyes

     they are blue it is the man and i tell you he is not married he
is the victim of some terrible plot his life is in danger

   nonsense exclaimed the sergeant bluntly the lady knew what
was the matter with him would not have him sent to a hospital and took him
home for treatment by the family physician who had pulled him through the
same sort of thing before 

    but i assure you sir he had no home in new york and any woman
claiming to be his wife was an imposter

     but she had the checks for all their baggage  her trunk was marked
with the initial of his name  his friend who was along vouched for her 
heres his card  mr james hewlett st louis and here on the back of it
is the address of mr roberts residence where they were going to take
him

     nevertheless i reiterate that all their representations were false i
should know  since he came from chicago for the express purpose of making
me his wife

   the sergeant stared at her blankly a moment then as an idea seemed to
an impromptu conspiracy



 dawn upon him grinned and replied with an air of insolent familiarity  i
 guess youre left my girl his wife has got him

     ethel did not readily understand him but when she did a wave of hot
 indignation seemed to course through every fiber of her being leaving her
 stronger than before to do battle for her own honor as well as for the
 life of the than she loved with enforced calmness she took from her pocket-
 book a dainty pencil and a card upon which she wrote rapidly on the rail
 before the sergeants desk then she handed it to him saying in a clear
 hard voice the contemptuous tone of which lashed even his dull sensibilities
 like a moral whip there are the names of the president of the art
 school in which i am a student the cashier of the bank holding my account
 a clergyman to whom i am known and two other persons on the other side
 is my name you have ignorantly and stupidly aided in the perpetration of
 a great crime and yoilr attitude toward me is infamous if you do not in-
 stantly take all means in your power to trace that unfortunate man and
 rescue him i shall have the aid of every person whose name i have written
 there in bringing you to account

     her determinat ion and earnestness frightened the fellow into realizing the
 possibility of his having made a great mistake and he lost no time in com-
 plying with her demand a policeman was detailed to accompany her to the
 address given by mr james hewlett where the sergeant did not doubt
 discomfiture was awaiting this fiery young woman  and the hackman in-
 spired by her promise of double pay started his horses at a gallop

    the hour was by this time near midnight and no light was to be seen in
 the house before which the hack stopped the policeman clambered down
 from the drivers seat carefully compared the number over the door with
 that upon the card he carried and then rang the bell fifty seventh street-
 where their quest had brought them-was silent and the peal of the bell
  rang out so loudly as to wake echoes all over the neighborhood  but not
 mtil the third summons did anybody respond then a second story window
 was thrown up and a man poking out his head demanded angrily 

       wliadyewant down there   

    was a sick gentleman named roberts brought here tonight asked
 the policeman

     no

       any family named roberts live in this house  

     no

      who lives here  

     higginbotham

       do you know anybody named roberts   

   oh go to thunder with your conundrums and the speaker
 slammed down the window vigorously

      return to the station as quickl  as possible directed the girl who from
 the open window cf the coach had listened to the brief colloquy and was not
 at all surprised by its outcome

    the sergeant when report was made to him was first amazed and then
 genuinely alarmed


an impromptu conspiracy

    are you sure you got the right number  he demanded

    dead sure affirmed the man

   well i suppose he must have been excited and made a mistake in
writing it down

      can you not find the driver of the hack they took    suggested ethel

    yes i know him well enough it was  red  maginnis 

    he was in front of the depot five minutes ago volunteered a policeman
who stood bjr

    fetch him ordered the sergeant

    red  maginnis upon being brought in narrated quite accurately the
circumstances under which the lady her sick husband and friend had left his
coach and told where he had no doubt they woxild still be found in the back
room of the little pharmacy

   but the sergeant seemed more alarmed than before i dont like the
looks of their going there i was down in that precinct before i was trans-
ferred here and know something of   frenchy  we never could get him dead
to rights on anything he was so sharp but he was suspected of everything
and i guess theres nothing he wouldnt do if hes mixed up in it theres
no time to waste take  reds  hack go through the place and if you dont
find the man keep a sharp lookout for the baggage 

    frenchy  had closed his store and gone to bed by the time they reached
his door but at the summons of the night bell quickly emerged from his little
room behind the prescription desk and lighted up his red flannel under-
clothing and red night cap caused him to resemble a big boiled lobster but
did not abate a jot from his dignity he was courteous but manifestly
annoyed as might reasonably be expected of an apothecary waked from sleep
without hope of profit

    was a sick gent fetched in here tonight one that was dead gone 
demanded the policeman

   yes msieu one who was as you say dead gone but i do not
know if he was sick pairhaps he only dine a leetle too well i think but i
am no doctor i am pharmacieu

      who brought him   

    a lady-his wife i presume-and a gentleman his friend as it did seem
to me

    did they bring any trunks inhere too 

    yes msieu and when they took him away they took also the trunks
the lady did say she have sent for her doctor to meet them here but in half
an hour he comes not and he would not longer wait so they call another car-
riage and go all away  

      who wouldnt wait  his friend j 

    no msieu the gentleman who had dined too well

    oh  then he recovered   

    certainement not pairfectly but so he make loud demand for more to
drink and create noise so that i have been very glad they shall go away for
i like not the disturbances in my store

      did you notice the number of the hack that took them away   
an impromptu conspiracy



    i  msieu  shall i go out in the cold to amuse me with the numbers
of hacks  no m  sieu  

   nothing more was to be got out of him the officer searched the place
thoroughly but could find nothing to justify suspicion of aught except gen-
eral uncleanness and though it was suspected that he was lying it could not
have been easily proved and proving would probably have done no good

   ethel was not for a moment deceived by his averment that the sick man
had recovered any more than he made her believe that her lovers illness was
simply drunkenness that john roberts was still alive she was confident for
her impressions though less clear than ordinarily owing to her mental per-
turbation continued to present him as in great danger only and had he been
actually dead she believed the fact would have been apparent to her

    frenchy  had expected a severer examination and it amused him to
think of awkward questions the officer could have asked had he been at all
shrewd in the seclusion of his little room he laid a lean forefinger along his
cunning nose and chuckled  police  cochons

    i dont see said the sergeant to miss holly when she returned to
him  that we can do anything more tonight than notify headquarters to
send out a general alarm and put the detective force on the case in the morn-
ing

    and meanwhile john roberts may be murdered

    for all we can do to prevent it

chapter vii-rosa mettres idea

                                                  

    do not be rash my dear ernest said madame mettre placidly occu-
pying herself in improving the little fire she had already kindled in the stove

   a decision based upon physical discomfort is apt to be faulty when you
get warm a grave may not seem any longer an immediate necessity

    i must dispose of him i decline spending the rest of my existence as
his charioteer  

    up to a certain point pursued madame reflectively  ones road may
make many crooked turns more or less agreeable but beyond that it is
liable to run straight and not in a pleasant direction

      what direction   he growled

    toward the gallows

   mettre winced but replied sturdily enough  why this time more than
any other   

    cases vary this one is serious i am afraid of something--i hardly
know what

  ah bah

     possibly it is  ball and perhaps also it is not  bah we will see when
we come to consider that vague something but first let us look at some
things we know to be real even a little man becomes enormous in quantity
when he presents himself as a corpse to be put away and this roberts is almost
of the giants think what a vast excavation would be needed to put him at
a safe depth and it is not really a cellar dowrn there but just a low place


an impromptu conspiracy

where you could not raise the pick above your head to dig i do not say the
ground does not hide well but circumstances are not always the same

   so far rosa you are quite right i admit that it would be hard
work

      good let us go a step farther rent for this place ycu pay quarterly
in advance you have done so for two years though this is the first time in
eight months we have been in it  

   but meanwhile it has sheltered more business than many stores open
to the public

    oh  i do not deny that it has had its uses at night but by day it
has always seemed deserted does it not strike you that the landlord may be
capable of occasionally coming around to see how his property gets itself
along and that he might be intermeddling pig enough to be curious why you
pay rent for it  

   well-if he does he is  policeman 

     true  but figure to yourself that a big reward might set both him and
the policemen to thinking of this deserted house as mysterious and suspicious
he might even invite them to investigate-and suppose they should find-

    in decency he should keep his mouth shut about the affairs of his
tenants at least so long as he gets his rent but there  what good could
you expect of a landlord  i will not say he could not be capable of doing
anything

     and though you have given him another name how can you ever be
sure of how much any person knows or at least suspects-which is even
worse 

    i see clearly wliat you mean to convey and again i say rosa your
reasoning is good this is not a safe place to deposit him you see i am
not unreasonable but in justice to me-you will admit that we have had to
act in this affair precipitately  -without deliberation  meeting emergencies as
they arose and hardly seeing two steps ahead and this is the best i could
do

   it is true and i do not blame you you have real genius for the
conquering of obstacles you are admirable therefore i do not say to you
that i object to your disposing of him in an- way you like because i happen
to be mixed up in the job and propose to take care of the only neck i have
no i take my chances with rou my dear ernest and if  object it is 
your account even more than my own

     one would wish to differ from you in order to be convinced by you my
dear rosa

    and the reasons i have given you against making ready here the
grave and the man to fill it are by  means all or even the best
you forget that though we are in possession of his effects we have not yet
examined them we do not know what those trunks contain and the
unknown is always full of possibilities it may be to our interest that
he shall survive or on the other hand that his body instead of being con-
cealed shall be found and its identity proved beyond question our oracle is
in those trunks in his satchel i found these bonds but they are only a little
an impromptu conspiracy



and he is a rich man here fake them there must be much more i am
not fool enough to expect a great sum of ready money in the trunks  but we
should find there the evidences of where his fortune is and knowledge how to
obtain it

    rosa you an an angel i do not say it because you give me the bonds
though it is true i appreciate them  but your superior finesse and fore-
thought make me feel that i am but a coarse bungler little more adroit than
the clumsy wielder of the sand club or the skulking artisan of the jimmy
to your astuteness i make my obeisance

    you flatter me too much my love you will end in making me proud
and the poet of the english says  by that sin fell the -angels  but now i
come to the last reason that which i passed over at the beginning do you
know that there is a girl who may meddle with us in this affair  a young
girl whom he wras about to marry   

    i was not aware of it he said nothing about her

    well it is true i know it for i have read her letters to him and she is
dangerous  

   if you say so i will not deny it but in what way  

     she possesses the power of seeing that which is afar off of knowing
what goes on at great distances

    a clairvoyant  

    hardly that i think but something more to be feared one whose
impressions come to her when she is awake and herself fully conscious of
them  

   i have heard of such things muttered ernest looking troubled and
do not like them they go beyond the limits the good god has set to human
knowledge and are very wicked generally i believe there is nothing in
them but the mischief of it is that you never can tell when there may be
something i wish i knew more about such things i could make them very
useful sometimes poor jacques siccardi you remember was run down by
 clairvoyants directions and hanged

    your reminiscence is not cheering

    no but it is true well we will not think any more about it now
if trouble comes we will meet it all the more bravely for not having wasted
our strength in shudders of anticipatory fear when the girl appears we
will hit upon some way of dealing with her the vital question at present
is-what do the trunks contain  let us get at them

   they found in john roberts trunks a good deal of valuable personal
property but tumbled it out  the floor and made little account of it with
the exception of a case of very handsome diamonds-a ring brooch and pair
of earrings these ernest gallantly presented to rosa as a part of the booty
naturally falling to her share a fine chronometer watch he took possession
of for his own use remarking that he would on the morrow have rabitschek
alter its number so as to baffle recognition

    i did not know he was that sort of engraver she said

    a man who is skilful enough to make bank note plates should be able to
engrave anything he replied


an impromptu conspiracy

   at the very bottom of the second trunk when they had almost begun to
despair of finding anything really valuable to them they discovered a flat tin
box the sight of which revived their drooping hopes it was locked and
there was no key fitting it in the bunch filched from roberts pocket nor
was one to be found in his wallet or in the big pocketboolc rosa had appro-
priated

   but she exclaimed he must have had one somewhere wait a
moment while i go through him again and she went into the back room
where the unconscious man lay

   he had not moved a muscle since they threw him there on the floor
and though she pulled him about tugged at his clothing and even rolled him
over turning inside out all his pockets he gave no sign of life at length
she found in a fob the little object she sought the care he had taken in
secreting it seemed to promise that the prize would be valuable

   rosa wras elated but in the same moment experienced a little shock of
anxiety for it seemed to her that their victim had ceased to breathe it
would be annoying she reflected it he should have settled matters for him-
self in that way before they had a chance to determine what would be best
for their interests it would be difficult as she had said to hide him prop-
erly in this place why could he not wait until they had him somewhere
handier to the water  she bent over him and laid her head against his
breast his heart was still faintly beating and she felt relieved

   mettre waited holding the box on his knees and guessing what was in it
to kill time momentarily increasing his estimates as the horizon of his desires
expanded then with feverish eagerness he snatched the key and used it

   the haul was a large one but in rather unsatisfactory shape there
were deeds for several large pieces of western real estate notes amounting
to tens of thousands from the man who bought the roberts lumber interests
a life insurance policy for fifteen thousand dollars certificates of deposit in
three new york banks amounting to some eighty thousand dollars  a
chicago bank book showing a handsome credit  quite a bundle of good
railway stocks and a bunch of shares in western industrials of
questionable worth-but among it all not a dollar in ready money or any-
thing convertible into ready money without serious risk

   m mettr was exasperated anathemas he cried  upon these
rich men  what infernal precautions they take to prevent honest men
getting a share of their ill gotten wealth  they are infamous  

   madame looked at him and smiled sardonically his disappointment had
been no greater than hers but the attitude he assumed amused her

   he went on with doleful shakings of his head  it was hardly worth
the trouble a little handful of bonds that will bring hardly anything in
europe where they must be sent for sale and a few dollars pocket money
not enough to pay the expenses of the enterprise that is all  

    you forget the diamonds and watch

    ah  true well it is not so bad as it might be  but not as good as
i had hoped he seemed to have forgotten also the two thousand dollars
he had found in roberts big wallet
an impromptu conspiracy



     wait a little let me think i believe we will yet be able to get the
bulk of this property if not all

    i have a prejudice against being hanged

    do you think i would find it amusing but no prize worth having can
be won without risk we have already gone too far to turn back my dear
friend the cards have been dealt and we must play the game out

      what is your idea  

    to inherit i have been his wife  i must be-his widow

chapter viii-working in the dark

   the general alarm was duly sent from police headquarters to all the
stations as the sergeant had promised miss holly it would be but of course
with as little result as if it had been a review of the weather at that time
the police cherished the theory that publicity inevitably defeated  the ends
of justice -as official blundering was grandiloquently styled-and reporters
were viewed with dread and abhorence almost as if they had been the
natural allies and protectors of the criminal classes consequently when the
instruction was given to look out for the missing man and the two persons
last seen in his company-with a fairly good description of each of the trio-
the possibility of any good result was greatly minimized if not destroyed
by the accompaning injunction that it must on no account be allowed to
leak out to the press it perhaps seemed likely to the official mind that
persons who had already demonstrated extraordinary interest in concealment
and cunning in securing it might walk up to members of the force pro-
claim their identity and request to be taken into custody but upon no other
hypothesis would the police methods of those days seem reasonable miss
holly believed that better results would be attained by enlisting the sympa-
thetic interest and aid of the great public

    hundreds of persons read the newspapers for every individual police-
man to whom you whisper your injunction that he shall look out she
said to the chief detective assigned to the case one who was esteemed great
because of his large acquaintance among thieves  publish widely the fact
that a man is missing that a large reward will be paid for finding him and
describe his supposed kidnappers when you do that you surround the
criminals with watchful eyes the light thrown upon their crime makes every
step one of danger for them men hunt nothing so keenly as gold make
the hunt for them a golden one and invite everybody to participate in it do
you fancy they will long be able to elude the observation of half a million
persons   

    it is natural for you to look at it in that way answered the man
with a great air of superior wisdom  but you lack experience we have
to deal with cases like this all the time i suppose there are more  missing
men  reported in new york than in any other city in the world

    i should think so she remarked drily

   the significance of her tone escaped him he went on argumenta-
tively   now lcok at it in this way suppose the man is kidnapped and


an impromptu conspiracy

the people who have got him are holding him for a reward they want to
negotiate on the d o -the dead quiet you know set everybody chasing
them with the best prospect for their being caught and somebody getting a
stake for it that you can imagine what do they do  why to save them-
selves they give up the game chuck the man into the river and slip out of
town then where are you and how much better off is the man offer
a reward if you like for information and no questions asked and the play will
be correct so long as you dont mention any name but if you were to give
it away as you proposed it would handicap the force so that we might just
as well give the job up altogether

   the girl was appalled by his suggestion that the missing man might be
thrown into the river to enable the escape of his kidnappers if they were
too closely pressed and though it was hard for her to believe that even
criminals could be so fiendishly cruel she was not prepared to deny the possi-
bility set before her by the experienced detective she no longer insisted on
the form of advertisement she had contemplated but the immediate offering
of a reward she was resolved upon and went at once to mr ditherow the
friendly bank cashier to consult about it

   mr ditherow was in a general way a kindly and helpful sort of man to
everybody so far as his profound reverence for business would permit but in
miss hollys case he was disposed to be exceptionally accommodating as his
friend john roberts had written bespeaking his good offices in her behalf

   it was therefore with mingled amazement and sorrowful sympathy that he
heard her astonishing story of mr roberts disappearance he too at first
was inclined to favor the widest publicity possible but like the girl hesi-
tated and doubted its wisdom when told what the detective had said

   i have sometimes thought he remarked that the police made a
mystery of everything in order that people might not realize by knowing
their failures how incompetent they were but it may be that notion does
them an injustice i would not like to run counter to their opinions based
 experience let the first advertisement go with initials only and if that
produces nothing we can consider how the next should appear i think that
will be the best plan

    how much have i still standing to my credit 

    i cannot say exactly without referring to the books but it is over five
thousand anjway 

    five thousand  

   yes unless you have been checking out a good deal within the past
four or five days

   oh  no but-i had no idea-are you sure there is not a mistake 
quite sure was the smiling reply i never make mistakes not
here at least a week ago by mr roberts direction the sum of 
was put to your credit

    he wrote to me that he had  sent a little to buy gowns and things for
as you probably know we were to be married upon his arrival-but i had no
idea of a great sum like that

    you may find it none too great if you depend upon it to bring him back
an impromptu conspiracy



   the girls lips quivered and tears stood in her eyes but she bravely
repressed her emotion and in a business like tone asked 

    what reward should i offer 

    a thousand-at first i should say

   she filled in a blank on a paper she had brought with her and handed it
to him asking   will that do 

  m-thousand dollars-j r-ethel holly i dont think if

i were you he said dubiously  that i would undertake to see people my-
self

   no  why mr ditherow who is more interested than i in seeing any
one who can- 

 yes but this involves seeing a great many people who cant you
have no idea liovv many persons and of what various sorts all want a
thousand dollars sharpers would fly to beguile your inexperience with lies 
cranks to force their visionary notions upon you for a price  charity solici-
tors who fancying you rich would think the time propitious for profitably
pressing their games on your sympathetic consideration  and above all
dangerous for you i in deference to the wishes of the police you mean to
conceal his identity-the newspaper reporters youve never met any of
them i suppose no  i thought not keen courteous adroit young men
innocent looking but able to give points to the oldest cross examiner when
ferreting out a  sensation  and quite conscienceless as to what they print so
long as it makes an effect why  bless you  my child  in half an hour they
would not only know who  j r was and all about him but all about you
your engagement and heaven knows what else

    but  she exclaimed in distress  if i dont do it wdio will  

    thats one of the things lawyers are made for i will give you a letter
to one a friend of mine who will attend to it without cost to you what-
ever the reporters can dig out of him without his knowledge and consent
they are welcome to  

   so lie gave her a note to mr darley-of darley fordyce  jadbury-
and their address was the one that appeared in the advertisement inviting
applicants for the reward

   the obnoxious classes hungering to finger the money troubled mr dar-
ley very little few wolves on predatory purpose bent are rash enough to
tamper with the temper of the grizzly in his home but neither awe of the
firms great name and imposing presence nor the artifices of the corps of
clerkly buffers interposed between mr darley and the door could keep the
reporters away from him and their shrewd persistence tried him sorely par-
ticularly as he was in conformity to instructions acting against his own
judgment in withholding the facts he believed in publicity and even sent
for the detective miss holly had seen to argue the matter with him but
the man of liabitual mystery continued to plead earnestly for congenial dark-
ness

    why he urged  if you give his name away and the papers get hold
of it it will put the kibosh   all weve done

    all youve done  what have you done  


an impromptu conspiracy

    weve got a clue mr darley yes sir you may smile but i tell you
we have and within twenty four hours well get the man in fact we may
lay hands on him tonight but if you go and  blow the gaff why the jigs
up  

     i dont take much stock in your  clue the word invites suspicion
the police clue rarely leads to anything except on the eighth day of the
week still well give you a chance but if your hide and go seek way
doesnt find something pretty quickly ill turn on the light

   of course the clue led to nothing and was replaced in the old familiar
way by  a new theory it was now the detectives ingenious idea that
john roberts had absconded from chicago and for reasons best known to
himself was hiding or had committed suicide this was after forty eight
hours reign of the  clue

   miss holly astonished and disgusted gave up all hope of aid from the
police ordered the reward increased to  and would have published the
missing mans name had she not been restrained by mr ditlierows fear that
it might be imprudent so large a reward lie argued would be almost cer-
tain to tempt some participant in the criminal secret to betra-al of his accom-
plices and that was their best prospect of ever again seeing john roberts alive
that he still lived kthel felt assured of that much her psychic sense
assured her but beyond that point the mysterious consciousness that was
once so clear existed no longer the calm receptive condition of mind
requisite for its manifestation was now wholly lacking day and night she
was agitated anxious excited a prey to constantly recurring alternations of
hope and despair the only impression she was able to cognize with any
degree of certainty was that though in awful peril her lover was not yet lost
utterly and this in some measure comforted her  for she said to herself
 while there is life there is hope

  chapter ix-plans of the plotters

   john roberts life was by this time a very small basis for hope not
until the morning of the second day after he was struck down did he give any
other sign of living than that faint fluttering beating of the heart which had
been noticed by madame mettre then still unconsciously he began the
slow and infinitely painful effort of crawling back from the clutch of death
to the world of living men at first he only groaned feebly at long inter-
vals but after an hour or two his fingers twitched nervously from time to
time and then he moved his hands but only a very little madame mettre
and her husband sat comfortablj looking down at him

    you must have given him a big dose ernest she remarked

    yes rather more than i intended but as matters have turned out the
excess was fortunate you see i did not know just how much so strong a
man would require he is powerful almost like a horse and i had to give
him a horse dose but better too much than too little one cannot risk
having a subject wake up inopportunely but hasnt he slept soundly 

    i was afraid that he was dead that stuff does kill doesnt it  
an impromptu conspiracy



    oh  yes if you give a little to much of it a dozen drops more
than he took i should say would have given old charon another passenger

      and are you not a little afraid of the second dose   

     we must risk it there is no other way to keep him quiet and now
that he has begun to wake up it will have to be given soon or he may
regain strength enough to make a row but i hope he will not die until we
get him where he can do so properly with due consideration for the interests
of his widow and i do not think he will i had the prudence to ask of
the italian physician who made the preparation what would be its cumula-
tive effects he told me that only continued torpor would ensue from a
second dose if it were less than two thirds of the quantity first given

    but the house is yet to be found and moving effected what will be
the effect of a third dose  

   from a third even if only half the quantity of the second supposing
the torpor to have been continuous a weak subject would not rally but a
strong one such as he is would probably last several weeks or possibly even
months in a state of imbecility a mere idiotic and feeble animal

   and then

   the condition and the subject-would cease at the same time

     it is perfect in that way he will give us no trouble  

    is it not strange that a few drops of a fluid that looks so innocent like
water and of little pronounced taste should have such effect on the life of a
man   mettre drew a small leathern case from a breast pocket and opening
it took out a tiny vial filled with a colorless liquid on the side of the vial
were small nicks to indicate minims by tens and twenties   what funny
things le bon dieu gives us he remarked regarding it contemplatively

   how much did you give him   

     clear down to there he replied indicating with a thumb nail a point
about one third from the shoulder of the bottle

      then you have filled it up again   

   oh yes  have plenty more and it is well to keep a full supply
handy  

     yes it is well rosa assented meditatively

   john roberts groaned more loudly managed to raise a trembling hand to
his throat and gasped weakly water water his eyes looking like
blood opened staringly but evidently saw nothing from his parched lips
the tongue protruded slightly dry and swollen water water he
whispered

    come   said mettre  we have no time to lose he must not wake
any farther get a glass of water  

    she procured and held it while he added from the vial some drops care-
fully measured neither the hand holding the glass nor that manipulating
the vial trembled when the dose was ready he raised the victims head
so that he might drink while madame mettre put the glass to the fevered
lips and slowly tipped it as he mechanically swallowed until it was
empty a convulsive shudder ran through the mans frame as if his physi-
cal nature revolted against this new attack upon its life an expression of


an impromptu conspiracy

horror distorted his face a hoarse inarticulate cry burst from his lips and he
writhed himself from mettres hands his head striking the floor with a loud
thump then he lay perfectly still madame mettre and her husband
looked across him at each other and smiled truly the celerity of its
action is to be admired -was the reflection of both

   in that instant the front door bell rang for a moment the mettres
stood motionless glaring at each other breathless with sudden fear ernest
first recovered himself with a catlike spring he passed into the front room
snatched up the weapons he kept ready to hand-a piece of heavy lead pipe
and a long keen knife-and posted himself beside the door opening from the
little hallway from there by a vigorous gesture of the head he directed
rosa to answer the summons

   he was too much excited to reason  to remember how well his trail was
hidden conscious guilt put imaginary policemen at the door and he was
ready to fight until he was killed rather than submit to arrest madame
mettre was cooler but accepted her husbands view of the situation and was
willing to share his fate with a cocked revolver in the hand hidden under
the little shawl crossed upon her breast she went to the door and opened it

   before her stood a gaunt middle aged man attired in a shabby genteel
suit of black and wearing a tall hat vaseliued to a glittering burlesque of
respectability under one arm he carried a big portfolio

    will you permit me madame he began working his leathery jaw with
great rapidity the instant he caught her eye   to invite your critical in-
spection of the most wondrously comprehensive and superb art publication
ever issued in this country or any other the  gallery of ancient and modern
masters  in fifty four parts at the ridiculously small price of fifty cents each
delivered monthly five full page masterpieces of steel engraving in each
part- 

   for a moment she was dazed  then the revulsion of feeling suddenly re-
laxing the strain upon her tense nerves she burst into almost hysterical
laughter the even flow of the mans unpunctuated eloquence ran right
on

    -with hundreds of wood engravings each a gem illustrating with ab-
solute fidelity the glorious works of the deathless masters-- 

   she saw that he was maneuvering to get a foot inside the threshold and
suddenly slamming the door in his face turned back into the room where
m mettre waited there was a grin upon his face but it was mechanical
he was not yet satisfied

    the wretch may be a spy he said  a detective in dsguise 
nonsense she replied detectives in this country do not disguise
themselves and go about to find out things they wait for stupid persons to
come and tell on themselves  

   but he leaped to the window and stood peering from behind one side of
the lowered curtain until he saw the book peddler go to two other houses
within sight then he too smiled with a sigh of relief and laid down his
arms

     what a scare that fellow gave me out there   he remarked
an impromptu conspiracy



    and what a scare you would have given him in here she replied
and they laughed merrily together

   as he made himself ready to go out he said  if his tongue swells and
sticks out any more jou will do well to raise his head  a pillow and put a
bit of ice in his mouth now and then i dont know that it is liable to choke
him but it might

     i will endeavor to remember and attend to it by the way if it is not
too much trouble will you not be so good as to bring back with you some
floss silk in pretty soft shades of pink and green i might as well be making
something to kill time

   so far from troubling it will be a pleasure to serve rou my dear
rosa  

     you have the list of all the things to put in the will  

     it is in my pocket

     that blank marriage certificate will not arrive today   

    oh  no it cannot be here before tomorrow you know i only tele-
graphed for it yesterday

    a new york one would perhaps have done as well

    no you wrere right one bearing the imprint of a chicago printer is
necessary no little precautions must be neglected

     and now you are off  she said kissing him farewell

     yes i go to seek a suitable residence for john roberts to die in

chapter x - a glimpse within the enemys lines

   the habit of thinking is by  means so common as it is popularly sup-
posed to be ernest mettre was one who thought as little as possible
whenever he attempted it he became a pessimist as a rule rosa did the
thinking for both he wras as he claimed to be a man of action and
that only without the guidance afforded by her subtle brain he would
probably have been a mere highway robber an instinct akin to that of a
carnivorous animal hunting its food made him keen to scent profitable opera-
tions and he did not lack a sort of intuitive cunning quickness of adaptation
to circumstances and a certain fertility of resources which was rather the
fruit of experience than the product of mental effort had he been alone 
such elaborate and daring scheme as he was now engaged in would ever have
entered his head but for his wdfe he would have been content with what he
got from his victims pockets and now the magnitude of the stake the
boldness and hazard of the game together pressed upon his consciousness as
he sat alone on the ferryboat and made him thoughtful

   the advertisement for information concerning j r appeared that
morning for the first time and he had just read it who knew the identity of
the missing man  that girl who wrote love letters to him and knew he was
coming to new york of course and that set him to thinking about her
such a power as hers was something worth while fearing luckily judging
from her letters she did not seem able to control it but who could tell at
what mischievous moment it might happen to serve her and if she should


an impromptu conspiracy

know where to strike her blow would fall out of the darkness with no possi-
bility of guarding against it since she was herself entirely unknown

   of the police he had not even a little bit of fear but this girl stirred the
latent superstition in his soul and thrilled him with apprehension decidedly
he said to himself it was necessary for him to know who she was and
where to see her if possible and perhaps find some way of learning from
time to time what she contemplated doing or had done and in all prob-
ability this advertisement would afford the needed clue to her if as he did
not doubt she was behind it

   as a first step he would go at once and have a lock at this lawyer
basily enough he found darley fordyce  jadbury in one of the immense
palatial office buildings  lower broadway and his heart sank when he
realized the quality of the legal force already as he felt enlisted against him
they occupied a long suite of magnificent offices the annual rental of which
he estimated would be rather a pretty fortune a girl who could afford to
employ a firm like this would be a serious antagonist even without any
occult powers to aid her it was no longer curiosity but desperation that
urged him to get sight of mr darley in that however he was foiled

   as a prospective client he managed to get past several clerks with not
much difficulty but at the managing clerk his progress was arrested and he
wras required to state the business upon which he wished to see mr darley
his story was ready he wished to get a divorce the managing clerk
seemed almost to freeze with surprise and horror divorce business he said
was not at all in the liti of darley fordyce  jadbury they would not
touch a divorce suit even for a bishop or a president and with icy cour-
tesy he bowed his visitor to the door going away m mettre said to him-
self that all things considered he did not really want to see mr darley the
desire had only been a whim

   presently the firms telephone bell sounded and a voice announcing itself
as that of a detective called out  tell mr darley that in the matter of j
r i will call at three oclock this afternoon with a woman who thinks she
knows where he is have somebody present for positive identification from
her description if possible and upon receiving assurance that the request
would be complied with the voice said  good by  in quite a businesslike
fashion

   m mettre had several hours free to devote to interviews with real estate
agents from whom he sought to rent a house  a detached one if possible of
not too great dimensions furnished in readiness for immediate occupancy
and at a price not excessive new yorkers are somewhat proud of the fact
that almost anything conceivable may be obtained in the metropolis if one
has the money to pay its price and so far as m mettre was concerned that
claim was made good the domicile lie found suitable-as if made to
order he said to himself-was on the north side of the harlem river a
pretty detached cottage half hidden among shrubbery on a somewhat lonely
lane a little back of morris dock one of the most charming locations within
the city limits it was the residence of a widow whose faili ng health impelled
her to seek a milder climate in the south of france
an impromptu conspiracy



   m mettre paid a months rent in advance and was allowed to take posses-
sion at once without the usual formality of references upon his explaining
that he rented the house not for himself but for a dear friend a westeni
man who had no acquaintances in new york and whose wife had brought
him here for treatment by the most eminent physicians procurable it was a
plausible story well calculated to win sympathy as he told it and he pru-
dently gave the name  john roberts  as that of the sick man who john
roberts was the agent could readily learn by reference to dun or bradstreet
of course the agent did not trouble himself to refer he felt safe in renting
the house under the circumstances

   at a little before three oclock m mettre haunted the hallway leading
to the offices of darley pordyee  jadbury which he watched until he saw
enter them a tall handsome girl whose eager excited look together with her
haste and glance of inquiry at her watch-making sure she was  time-as
she neared the door all assured him he had found  ethel if any linger-
ing doubt had remained in his mind it would have been dispelled by the
disappointment and dejection in her face when an hour later she left the
building when the promised woman failed to appear the lawyers quick
intelligence realized that the telephone message had been a trick perpetrated
by the enemy but what its object was he could not divine the problem
of its purpose occupied ethels mind as she went down to the street and
boarded a broadway car  and continued to engross her thoughts while riding
up town so that she saw hardly anything about her and was not even aware
of the little man seated opposite who furtively watched her while pretend-
ing to read an afternoon newspaper when she left the car he did the same
unnoticed by her and followed until he saw her open with her own latch
key the door of her boarding house he had achieved all he dared attempt
at least all that he would venture without first asking the advice of madame
rosa	

   returning down town he did not neglect to procure the floss silk desired
by his wife and was careful to select delicate shades that he knew would please
her but one more item remained on his outdoor program for the day that
was to call upon a certain lawyer who-as he had reason to know-would be
willing for a suitable compensation to draw up john roberts will a proper
one leaving everything to his beloved wife rosa and naming his best friend
m ernest mettre as sole executor and even make it holographic if he were
supplied with good specimens of the testators writing

   the lawyer found his visitors memoranda inadequate and declared that
to give the document vraisemblence it would be necessary for his confi-
dential agents to search the records in counties where the real estate lay to
learn if any mortgages were carried on it or any judgments stood against it 
also to see if there were any other recorded possessions than those for which
deeds had been found m mettre chafed over the delay this would involve
if really done but shrewdly suspected the requirement was only a device to
draw a large sum from him for expenses and made little objection
terms being amicably settled the lawyer promised to expedite the search he
had insisted upon and engaged that within two weeks his part of the under-

taking would be accomplished m mettre had to content himself with this
arrangement and took his departure

chapter xi-a new factor in the chase

    the increase of the reward from one thousand to twenty five hundred
dollars at miss hollys order stirred the wistful interest of many persons
but especially thrilled the acquisitive soul of one joseph fabitzky a red
headed russian jew who kept a small but very profitable ivery stable his
acquaintance among the plunderers of society was large and though he was
too cautious to be tempted into participating in their enterprises he took a
morbid interest in their achievements and as far as he could shared their
profits-strictly in the way of business so well informed was he that with
greater certainty than the detectives he was able to tell from the style in
which the job was done who were the  artists  engaged in it

   that the advertisement in question was a sort of surface indication of
 one of the big jobs he had instinctively recognized at a glance but while
the reward was only a thousand dollars his interest was limited to mild
curiosity he tried to think who had probably been the operators but in
vain none recurred to his remembrance who even remotely fitted into such
an enterprise as he guessed this to be so he gave up the puzzle and thought
no more about it until the reward leaped to a figure well worth considering
when he was suddenly seized with a wild desire to possess it and he had
sufficient astuteness to recognize in that speedy large increase the eloquent
expression of a distressful anxiety not likely to haggle over stipulated terms

   three or even five thousand dollars he believed would be paid as
readily as the offered sum for the desired information especially if the ad-
vertiser was as labitzky suspected a woman a man he said to himself
appreciating better the value and power of money would have made his
advance more gradually something told him that he must have been at
least in business touch with that mystery and it exasperated him to think
that it had eluded him the missing man had been put away and his
horses had no doubt been used and yet he knew not whom to suspect

   it spoke well for josephs fidelity to his patrons that though he had seen
offered many good rewards which he could easily have earned he had never
yet  given away  anybody but he was one of the men who  have their
price  and the five thousand dollars he told himself were obtainable in this
case tempted him and he might sell the information-if he could get it-
without his treachery ever coming to light

   referring to a private memorandum book he reviewed carefully all the
night work his horses had done during a fortnight past and had a pretty clear
idea -of what they were wanted for in every case-with a single exception
four nights previous duung his temporary absence from the stable the
hostler had let out  brown dick and mate  to a man who was unknown to
him but had the right word and paid without question tl e usual price of a
 first class job  the more joseph thought it over the stronger grew his
impression that that transaction would bear investigation
an impromptu conspiracy



   he called the hostler into his office and questioned him sharply but the
man had little or nothing to tell beyond the story he had already related of
the affair

    and you say pursued labitzky  that he returned the coach and team
to patsey at the corner of lexington avenue and thirty second street after
about two hours and a half  

    yes sir

      did you notice their legs   

    i did sir they were covered with sandy mud up to their knees the
sort of mud they have over on the other side of the river i have noticed it
on the horses legs before  

    and he was a slim undersized man with a little mustache 

   thats what he was sir i dont think i ever see him round here
before

   dabitzky made mental review of all the  crooks he knew who might
undertake such a job but that description would apply to none he could
recall and he had to admit to himself that he had nothing but intuition
which others would call mere vague suspicion upon which to base his belief
that there was any connection between the  slim undersized man  and the
missing  j r practically he knew  more than the advertiser
and all his cogitations from such knowledge as he possessed were but profit-
less threshing of old straw

   but fate was minded to give him another chance at the mystery the
increased reward had tantalized him day after day and he had about given
up hope fearing that those who held  j r  would negotiate on their own
account and so end the matter when one night a little after ten oclock a
dapper little gentleman slim and undersized entered his office and said he
wanted a coach and team without a driver and if practicable he would
like to have the same team he had a few nights before

   labitzkys office was a place of shadows his patrons preferred to have
it so its only lightwas that of a tin stable lantern which-when its door
was opened-sufficed to count money by and more was not needed no
books were kept

   to get a look at the strangers face the jew led the way into the stable
back of the office-where a gas jet flared between the stalls-with the nomi-
nal purpose of consulting his hostler upon the team asked for but his
inquisitiveness was baffled the strangers coat collar was turned up and
the brim of his hat bent down so that only his mustache and the point of his
nose were visible nevertheless he identified himself to the hostlers recol-
lection who said readily   oh  yes i know you had brown dick and
mate theyre in now and to his employer he added meaningly but in
a seemingly casual way  this is the gentleman who got the team the night
you were out to the primary

   the fact did not take joseph by surprise he had expected it from the
moment the man entered the office and was resolved that this time he would
capture the key to the mystery as before the stranger borrowed a hack-

mans long waterproof coat while he was putting it  dabitzky found an

      c


an impromptu conspiracy

opportunity for whispering to patsey the stable boy   shadow him-do not
let him get out of your sight when the coach was ready the stranger paid
without demur the large hire demanded for mysterious service arranged that
someone should be in waiting from three oclock at the corner of madison
avenue and forty third street to receive the rig mounted the box and
rapidly drove away half a block behind keeping himself in the shadows
raced patsey

   the lad did not think of it as a hardship or even a seriously difficult task
that he should be sent out to follow to an indefinite distance a team of lively
trotters under orders not to lose sight of them he was a long gaunt raw
boned irish boy about eighteen years old with the fleetness and endurance
of an indian and as he knew by experience he would be helped to some
extent by the many little checks a team necessarily meets with in the crowded
streets such reliefs would of course be less frequent late at night than in
the day time but as he could maintain a jog trot all day long he had no fear
of being left behind yet that was the very thing that happened to him
within fifteen minutes after setting out

   the coach went through the gates at the thirty fourth street ferry just
as they were being closed and rumbled aboard a boat which was the next
moment cast loose and started out of the slip patsey foiled in his attempt
to follow through the great gates had to run around through the passenger
entrance buy a ticket drop it in the box and-when he reached the big glass
doors found them shut in his face tlielad was chagrined never before
had he failed in such an undertaking and it made him all the more angry to
think that he should have been beaten simply by circumstances without even
the knowledge of the man he was shadowing

   partly because he was reluctant to return and confess such swift defeat
and in part to gain time for invention of some plausible lie he remained loiter-
ing in the vicinity of the ferryhouse fully an hour then the good fortune
he had thought of as barely possible befell him brown dick and mate emerged
from the gate returning to the city and he had another chance this time
he swore they should not escape him

   fortunately the driver saw fit to keep in the principal thoroughfares
where the presence of a carriage at any hour is not likely to be noticed as
it might be in quieter streets so patsey got two helpful lifts from street cars
going his way and had no trouble in keeping the vehicle in sight but when
it started up eighth avenue above fifty ninth street at a much accelerated
pace the conditions became more difficult slowly but steadily the runner
fell behind farther and farther yet still he kept on with dogged determina-
tion though he began to fear he was sadly out of training and the chase a
much longer one than he had bargained for a scotch mist was falling and
through the murky atmosphere it was difficult to see clearly any considerable
distance ahead

   from time to time he would lose sight of the object of his pursuit and
need to put forth all his energies to go more swiftly for a short distance at
length the coach disappeared and he was quite unable to overtake it the
muscles of his legs seemed burning the dryness of his throat choked him he
an impromptu conspiracy



panted for breath and knew he could do no more somewhere far ahead
the carriage faded away in the night and mist while the faint sound of its
wheels  the soft elastic roadway grew fainter until it became silence

chapter xii-preparing for the final stroke

   one week of the two required for the drawing of the will had gone
by and the mettres now feeling safe from pursuit and well assured of for-
tune were comfortably domiciled with their victim in the retired cottage
beyond the harlem after the nomadic and vicissitudinous career they had
been accustomed to for ears they enjoyed keenly the possession of a
luxurious home and their new consciousness of assured competence the
cottage was a very comfortable one and elegantly furnished  they had been
so fortunate as to re tain the widows servant who was an excellent cook  no
neighbors or wants troubled them and nothing occurred to disturb their
serenity rosa rather regretted that the widow had taken the canary away
but promised herself she would soon get one of her own

   the third dose of poison had been given to john roberts with the re-
sultant effects promised by the italian artist in assassination who provided
it the doomed man had been transformed from the semblance of a corpse
to that of an animal the fever in his veins had ceased to rage but seemed
to have wasted his tissues and burned out his strength memory conscious-
ness and will he had lost with assistance he could walk a few steps
totteringly but if not upheld would fall and lie where he had fallen not
aware when he was hurt the only sound he made was an occasional moan

   the servant could not help observing-as it was intended she should-
how devoted his good wife was in her care of him very seldom did she
leave him alone more than a few minutes at a time and her affectionate
patience in endeavoring to make him comfortable appeared to be inde-
fatigable during hours together she sat near him embroidering beautiful
moss rose buds on black velvet-a pair of slippers she was making for
ernest-and sometimes with tears in her eyes she would talk to the servant
about what a fine man mr roberts was before he had this awful stroke
and as for m mettre the sick mans friend who occupied a room by him-
self up stairs the servant was prepared to vouch that he also was very good
he stayed about the house almost all the time helping mrs roberts to at-
tend upon her sick husband whose affliction evidently saddened him and his
only distractions were the playing of doleful airs on a flute in his room and
the getting up of dainty french dishes in the kitchen

   one day making sure that their conversation would not be overheard
rosa said to her husband    this farce must soon end i am getting deadly
tired of it he bores me and i fancy it is time to call in a physician
we must have one you know to get the certificate of death which will be
requisite for his burial

    true i had forgotten it  but what a remarkable woman you are my
dear rosa  you forget nothing yes  it is needful but do you think it
altogether safe   


an impromptu conspiracy

      entirely i have studied him closely he is a perfect imbecile and so
near the end that we have no time to lose the doctors could not help him
and i do not think any of them would be able to guess that his malady is not
a natural one

     nevertheless it might be prudent to get one of not too much intelli-
gence  

     that will be easy but i have talked with the servant who has lived
here some time and learn there is near by one who is as if made to order
for us he is young susceptible and seeking practice 

       his name   

    metcalf-dr algernon metcalf when i heard that name  algernon
i knew we need seek no farther fate bestows upon some infants instead
of brains certain names and  algernon  seems to be one of them

    it would be a bad joke on us if he should find some way of curing
him

   impossible are not we the nurses but come when a thing
has to be done it is wrell to do it at once go and find that doctor get the
address from the girl so that she will know you have gone for him

    dr metcalfs appearance when he presented himself confirmed madame
mettrd in her estimate of algernons he wtas young over dressed had a
weak face and was conspicuously anxious to please even obsequious in his
assent to any suggestions and acceptance of the representations made to him
while he affected to make a critical examination of the patient the supposed
mrs roberts talked to him and when he spoke it was but to echo what she
had said nothing could be done the case was one of progressive and
rapid deterioration of brain tissues for which science knew no cure the
fatal ending might be delayed for weeks or even months but was inevitable
in all such cases naturally he asked some questions as to the cause of the
affliction and the grief stricken wife bravely repressing her tears told him

     i cannot give you any particulars of my own knowledge but from what
i have been told he brought it upon himself unhappy differences between
us-things i could not condone-separated us for several years until quite
recently when i learned of his sad condition and putting aside all memory
of past grievances hastened to his rescue but i fear too late he had been
living among a fast set of men in chicago and with his natural tendency to
excesses-you can probably imagine better than i could tell you the life he
led

   the young doctor looked wise and gravely nodded he could imagine
that and he also imagined what a noble forgiving self sacrificing wife it was
the fortune of this unworthy man to possess they had not scrupled to carry
on this conversation in john roberts presence he was past understanding
their words in a low easy chair drawn before the window he lay with his
eyes fixed in a vacant stare upon the ceiling his arms dangling at his sides
every line of his limp figure expressive of complete prostration mental and
physical the woman went to him and laying her arm about his head caress-
ingly said in a tone of grief

     oh  you poor dear  how sorry i am that i ever let you go away from
an impromptu conspiracy



me in anger if you had been true to yourself and to me you would not
have come to this

    it was like an apostrophe to the dead

   dr metcalfs eyes moistened with sympathy m mettre came in and to
him the doctor reiterated what he had said about the hopelessness ofthe case
then he took his departure and at the door mrs roberts put in his hand the
most liberal fee he had ever received much more than he would have ven-
tured to expect

   m mettns had been impatient for him to begone but that fact was only
perceived by her keen eyes and ready perceptions when she returned to the
parlor after dismissing the doctor she was smiling  he is safe to give me
any certificate i want whenever i want it he would write it now if i asked
him to she said

   her husband gave no heed to the remark something else preoccupied
him and he had ceased even to think of the doctor he stepped quickly to
each of the doors saw that they were carefully closed and then returning to
where rosa stood lighting the gas drew a newspaper from his pocket  see
here   he exclaimed in a tone of repressed anxiety  what do you think of
this  the reward is increased to five thousand dollars j

    she read the advertisement deliberately pondered with knitted brows for
a brief space and then answered with calm assurance very well let
them offer what they like there is no one who can tell them anything

   it is not that i fear but the offer of so large a sum demonstrates a
powerful interest that may give vis much trouble when we come to claim the
property i do not like the prospect some one seeks to dispute with us

possession of his wealth

    do not be frightened all dangers look larger at a distance than when
one comes close to them what can any claimant have to oppose to our
rights  have i not the evidence that i am his legal wife  shall we not
have a will in his own hand leaving everything to me and making you his
sole executor  let them say what they please about us there will be the
facts and who else can have so much  can they prove negatives  no
we are all right i tell you

    i wish to believe with you i do and yet-we do not know enough
about that girl ethel who is her backer  where does she get so much
money to offer for information 

    you are right we must know more of her i will go to see her
and give her such a grand bluff that she shall tell me all we want to know  
had either of them been observing the haggard imbecile wreck in the low
chair at the window a strange thing would have been noted at the mention
of ethels name a momentary flash of intelligence appeared in his eyes and
he seemed to listen

chapter xiii-an audacious intrusion

mettrij was quite right in suspecting that somebody with more means
than ethel holly possessed was behind her in the offer of that double reward


an impromptu conspiracy

but nobody was more surprised by its announcement than the girl herself
she had been thinking only the night before of offering a larger sum to the
extent of every dollar she could command and had resolved to consult mr
ditlierow about it that very morning when the changed advertisement ap-
peared instead of going to the bank she sought mr darle

    late last night he told her  the legal representative of the indem-
nity mutual insurance company came to my house with a proposition to add
to the reward on behalf of that corporation a sum equal to that already
offered by you there was no time to spare if we would have the change
appear in this mornings papers  i could not consult with you so i took the
responsibility of assenting at once

    i am glad you did mr darley she replied  but why do you sup-
pose this insurance company interests itself to such an extent 

    for a very practical selfish reason you maybe sure since the act is
that of a corporation the new york police naturally made inquiries of the
chicago police about john roberts  when he left there  his condition at the
time  who started with him if any one and so on of course mentioning the
fact of his disappearance in some way that leaked out and reached the ears
of one of his acquaintances the local agent of the indemnity mutual company
who had placed an insurance of fifteen thousand dollars on his life as a
business precaution the agent immediately notified the home office and the
actuary or manager at once took active measures to protect his company
against what might turn out to be a swindle from his po nt of view it is
not a matter involving any personal sympathy you understand or admitting
of sentimental considerations for all he knows to the contrary john
roberts might have put himself out of the way to  beat  the company or
conspirators may have disposed of him to win the insurance in either case
the company would resist payment of the claim and for that possible contest
it now seeks to arm itself i do not at all imagine that it confines itself to
this advertisement no doubt it has shrewd detectives at work already here
in chicago and possibly in several other cities  

      whatever their reasons we have cause to be thankful for their cooper-
ation we have seemed to be powerless to effect anything

   ethel returned home in a much more hopeful frame of mind than she
had known since this great trouble came upon her the sweet sympathy of
friends in time of distress may perhaps be soothing to the afflicted but for
real solid comfort nothing is superior to the consciousness that it is to the
selfish interest of somebody who may have the power to remove the causes
of distress the phrase is a popular and expressive one that money
talks but it is wrong sympathy talks but money acts and action is
what is needed when things go wrong the girl remembered having heard
it said that an insurance company would spend ten thousand dollars in resist-
ing a fraudulent claim for one thousand and she was glad to have such a
plucky fighter enlisted in her interest

   that afternoon a lady at the door of miss hollys residence asked to see
her but would give no name to the servant who answered her ring saying
simply that as she was unknown to miss holly and her call one of business
an impromptu conspiracy



it would not be necessary ethel was at her drawing table endeavoring to
distract her thoughts by work when her visitor appeared she saw before
her a little lady attired with rich but simple elegance whose features were
physically handsome though somewhat hard in expression and whose most
noticeable characteristic was a very brilliant pair of glittering black eyes
small but full of animation

    the name by which you are known said the stranger with a note of
interrogation in her voice as i have been given to understand is ethel
holly

    that is my name replied the girl astonished at the mode of address
mine as it may interest you to know is mrs roberts mrs john
roberts do you comprehend   

   ethel staggered and clutched for support the back of the chair by which
she was standing unable to find a word in reply to that astounding averment
the woman went on 

    it has come to my knowledge that close relations existed between you
and my husband in chicago that he has been paying your expenses here
that you have been exchanging amatory letters  and that you expected him
to rejoin you in this city you need not attempt to deny the facts the
proofs are in  hands and he has confessed i suppose you will not find it
difficult to understand how a wife looks upon a woman in your position
easlied to anger by the womans insultingly scornful tone ethel re-
torted hotly i do not know who you are and when you say you
are john roberts wife i believe you are telling an untruth he is too
true and noble to have practised upon me such a cruel deceit as you impute
to him he has no wife

    it is just possible that you may be an innocent victim  girls sometimes
are  and though the world may think differently i am willing to give you
the benefit of the doubt

      what evidence can you give me that you are what you say   

    i am not accustomed to having my word doubted but we will let that
pass this should be sufficient i imagine to answer that question as
she spoke she drew from her bosom and displayed a large showy steel
engraved marriage certificate attesting the union of john roberts and rosa
marie le brun by the rev caleb smith in bloomington illinois at the
date several years back ethel stretched out her hand to take the paper for
closer inspection but the woman drew it back saying in a tone of suspicion 
 that will do you can see it quite as well in my hands and i prefer to re-
tain it

   an official looking document possesses an inherent fascination for women
the idea of questioning its genuineness is not apt to occur to them it awes
them into credence into forgetting that it is just as easy to write a lie as to
speak one notwithstanding her trust in her lovers honest loyalty ethel
felt dazed bewildered and burst into tears the woman seemingly satisfied
with the effect produced continued in a somewhat gentler tone 

    we were married as you have seen in bloomington six years ago but
separated after only one year i was jealous and he gave me too much
iooo

an impromptu conspiracy

cause for being so i could not put up with his fondness for other women
but though i knew he wished me to get a divorce i would not do so i
still loved him too well faithless as he had been and hoped that he would
reform and come back to me he went to chicago where as i have since
learned he led a very gay life as a single man but a few weeks ago friends
brought us together again he was suffering the most terrible consequences
from his life of unrestrained license and professed penitence he confessed
his follies-not all i suppose but enough-you among the rest and i forgave
him i brought him east in the faint hope that medical science might still
save him but too late i fear he has been gradually sinking and the
doctors give me no hope of his recovery i might utter bitter reproaches to
you but i will not i simply leave you to your own conscience

    oh madame you are cruelly unjust to me how could i be responsible
for his condition  i was for a short time employed by him in his office
in his demeanor toward me in every action of his life within my knowledge
he was the soul of honor kindness and courtesy how was i to imagine
such sad things as you tell me i cannot believe them even yet in his
letters to me he said nothing of failing health onty the day before he left
chicago he wrote to me a letter full of strength and happiness and hope
we were to be married upon his arrival

    so i have understood you expected but it is at his wish that i come to
undeceive you and to request the return of his letters and whatever papers of
his you have  

   oh 

    you can hardly refuse the request of a dying man as he is and i
hope you will restrain yourself from making any scandal when he is laid to
rest you would have nothing to gain by it and would only injure whatever
reputation you may have here

    here  you speak madame as if my good reputation were a matter
of locality i have nothing to blush for in my relations to john roberts
aud why should i as you say make a scandal i do not understand what
you fear i might do i do not seek publicity since his mysterious disap-
pearance i have tried to find him but for his sake as much as my own

     you have tried to find him  what do you mean   

    i have had the police seeking him and have advertised for information
concerning him this is my advertisement and she pointed it out in a
newspaper she took up from her table

   the false mrs roberts read the proffer of reward very deliberately with
a frown upon her brow then said severely  i think it a piece of unwar-
rantable presumption on your part   and before the girl could reply she
added with a significant sneer  he must have been very liberal for you to
be able to offer so large  reward  

    oh  it is not all mine the indemnity mutual insurance company
offers half 

   it was with difficulty the woman suppressed a start of alarm at that infor-
mation she had a well founded dread of the determined cold blooded com-
bative intelligence serving the interests of great insurance corporations and

had already resolved to make no claim for the large sum of john roberts
policy it had been her hope that if she let the company alone it would let
her alone but here it seemed to be if not exactly taking the initiative in a
fight at least putting itself in an attitude for mixing dangerously in her
affairs there was indeed serious ground for apprehension but she con-
trolled herself well and in a tone of indifference asked   well what informa-
tion have you obtained 

    none none whatever it has been as if the sea had swallowed him
but you-you were with him  were you not   

      of course i was with my husband  

    and where is he now you will let me see him will you not oh 
only for a moment-in pit--

    certainly not  the idea  the book of my husbands errors is closed
o allow you to stand by his deathbed would be an indecency you have
done mischief enough be satisfied with what advertising of your personality
you can get out of your vulgar sensational creation of a mystery where none
exists go no farther with it and leave him to die in peace get me those
letters and let me go  

   ethel stood silent while the woman spoke motionless as a statue those
first words of denial seemed to stun her then suddenly a new light
burst upon her either her entire abandonment of self in that passionate
regard for another or the intensity of the shock she suffered raised
her consciousness above the personal plane and her psychic faculty
returned to her with greater clearness than ever before a look of horror
and loathing overspread her expressive countenance and with a gesture of
repulsion she said to the woman in a low thrilling monotone

     ah  i know you now as ou are i see your soul  it is black with
perfidy and cruelty  you are not a woman but a fiend  you have lied to
me  john roberts is true  you are not his wife  you are a murderess 

and i will save him from you  i will denounce you  i will- she

choked tottered beat the air an instant aimlessly with her hands and utter-
ing a shriek fell unconscious to the floor

   madame mettre glared savagely down at her for a moment muttering
vindictively   oh  if i only dared to finish you now   then the sound
of hurried footsteps coming in response to the girls cry recalled her to her-
self and with a look of sweet concern she said smoothly to the servant enter-
ing the room  i have brought some bad news to the poor young lady and
she has fainted you had better look after her  

   the next instant she ran down the stairs out of the front door sprang
into the coupe waiting for her and was carried swiftly away saying with rage
to herself  i will take my revenge-through him

chapter xiv-patseys plan

   to joseph labitzky the sight of the increased offer was almost madden-
ing as before his minds eye saw far beyond the printed figures and he
said to himself it was not simply five but eight or even ten thousand dollars


an impromptu conspiracy

he might be getting now if that wretched patseys legs and wind had not
given out at the critical moment perhaps when he would have had a half
dozen more blocks to go at one moment joseph would find himself moved
to tears by his deep sense of loss for he had brought himself to look upon
that reward as rightfully his the next he would fall to execrating the luck-
less patsey and swearing by all the prophets that he would not be despoiled
but yet would find a way to win the prize

    the lad feeling himself guilty took his masters reproaches meekly and
did more hard thinking over the problem of how to retrieve his defeat than
he had ever bestowed upon any one subject in all his life before and one
day an idea a forlorn hope occurred to him

    why not try what the horses might do for ye sor he suggested tim-
idly  sure theres no end to the knowledgeableness of dumb brutes some-
times and brown dick has as much sense as a man

   more than one i know growled the jew bitterly but what the
mischief do you mean 

    try if the horses wont remember where they went that night let me
put them to the same coach and drive them over the same road he druv them
until i was clear beat out and had to give up then ill not put a finger on
the lines but give them their heads and maybe theyll think it was the same
place they went before that theyre going 

    it wouldnt do any harm to try it mused the proprietor  brown
dick has sense he has come home alone from all parts of the city theres
no doubt of his being able to remember and think but-hes only been
there the once

     true for you sor and the better chance hell have it isnt like as if
he be to go somewhere down town where maybe his mind would be mixed
up betune a hundred times hed been over the ground every which way

    you can try it go at once

    patsey felt a curious interest in the experiment for its own sake without
any participation in or knowledge of the serious ulterior purposes of his em-
ployer and was soon on his way up town driving brown dick and mate
he followed carefully from the thirty fourth street ferry the route over
which they passed on the night he ran behind them even made little halts
where incidents had occurred to check momentarily their progress on that
occasion and switched in and out of car tracks where mettre when driving
had made such small divergencies it was as if the lad with a shrewd ap-
preciation of the value of reawakened impressions was striving to compel the
horses to recall their service that night and prepare them for automatically
continuing their present journey by the impulse of that recollection when
they reached lenox avenue he let the lines drop upon their backs and per-
mitted them to regulate their pace to suit themselves at the rise to the
central bridge they slackened their speed to a walk and patsey believed the
intelligent animals by their rubbing of noses nudgings of heads and little
snorts were discussing in a language of their own what was expected of
them and reminding each other of landmarks noted on their preceding jour-
ney so he did not attempt to guide them when they left the bridge by its
an impromptu conspiracy



northwestern approach and entered upon a maze of new streets narrow dirt
roads and rugged lanes altogether new to him

    this part of the oad was heavy and the horses left to themselves moved
at a pace hardly faster than a languid walk through bits of woodland past
pretty residences and by well kept grounds that in the summer time were 
doubt charming at length by their own volition they drew the coach
close to the side of the road before a handsome cottage surrounded by shrub-
bery and stopped patsey-who had pretended to be asleep on his box as
the readiest explanation to any observer of the way his horses were allowed
to wander at their own sweet will-seemed to wake up took a keen compre-
hensive glance at the house and its surroundings and with a click of the
torgue and a light flick of the whip sent brown dick and mate away at a
lively trot no one at the cottage he believed had seen him a pale
hollow faced man apparently sick was lying at the window but his eyes
seemed to be fixed on the sky and no one else was in sight

    labitzkys heart gave a great bound of joy when he received that report
for he divined that the man at the window wras none other than the  j r
for whose discovery so handsome a reward was offered in his delight he
was rash enough to promise patsey if this brings me good luck i will
give you a dollar besides y-our wages 

     bedad thought the lad  it must be a fortune itll be worth to him
or hed never risk breaking his heart with the thought of prodigality like
that ill not spend that dollar till i get it

   confident now of being in a position to exact compensation far beyond the
offered terms the jew made liaste to see the nominal advertiser mr darley
but his haste was that of a rogue skilled in the ways of rogues and suspicious
of everyone going straight to the lawyers office he would have deemed
preposterous folly he did not mean that any hint of what he knew should
be wormed out of him until he was sure of receiving his price and would
he put himself in the way of having a pack of detectives turned loose upon
him to find out about his business perhaps to get the secret from foolish
patsey  no he was too old to step into any such trap besides he meant
to stipulate that in addition to the money reward he should receive assurance
that he would not have to appear in the transaction for notoriety would blast
his good repute for trustworthiness among his patrons and he might as well
give up business at once as have the name of being a  stool pigeon

    iu the darkness of an areaway across the street from mr darleys resi-
dence dabitzky waited late that night until he had seen guests go away from
the house the lights in the parlor extinguished and other lights set flaring in
upper rooms indicative of the familys retiring then lie rang the bell and
when the servant admitted him stood in the hall nervously twirling his hat
until mr darley enveloped in a dressing gown came down the stairs  i
have come about the advertisement the caller began

    why did you not come to the office  that is my place for doing busi-
ness rejoined the lawyer impatiently

     it isnt mine i preferred to see you here

     well wliat do you know out with it


an impromptu conspiracy

      i know where to find the man you are looking for  

    when you prove that you will receive a check for the reward offered
 no i never handle checks money keeps its own secrets checks
blab but putting that aside for the present it is not enough

    five thousand not enough  

    not for me

      how much do you want   

    ten thousand

    oh  that is preposterous  you surely are not serious

    that is my price

    but i have no authority to pay any such amount i am only the repre-
sentative of another person jou understand

    then we can do no business until you obtain authority it may seem a
considerable sum to you sir but it would not be worth my while to take for
less the risks that giving away this job will involve for me

    ah  then you know there is a conspiracy and who are in it  

    im saying nothing about what i know until you get authority to deal
 but do you not see that the more comprehensive your knowledge is the
more likely consent to increased payment will be  

    perhaps but i havent lost any conspirators and am not hunting any
you want to know where the man is all i have to say at present is that i
can put my hand on him

      then he is alive still   

    at four oclock this afternoon he was

    and for ten thousand dollars you will restore him to his friends and
give up to justice the persons who abducted him  

    as to him yes but about them ill have to think it over maybe it
would be safer for me it depends on that

   very well think it over i have no doubt it can be arranged
where shall i send to let you know if i receive the authorization   

    you will not send anywhere replied the informer with a grin i
dont give you my address for fear you might accidentally lose it and some
poor innocent fly cop picking it up might take unnecessary trouble on my
account see  and im not likely to ever be at home anyway all you
will have to do will be to put in tomorrow evenings news an advertisement
of three words  reliable-agreed-ten you give me your word now that
these will not appear except in good faith that no game will be put up to do
me out of my money and that no spy will be employed to find out who i am
or my business   

    i pledge you my word of honor that there shall be no attempt to take
an unfair advantage of you in any way

    im satisfied youre a gentleman then if the ad comes out ill be
here at your door as soon as its dark to take you and any one person you
want to bring along to where the man is ill fetch a coach and youd
better be armed for the people who take the chances of jobs like this are not
likely to be lambs and doves

    i suppose not arms will be a matter of course
an impromptu conspiracy



     when dabitzky emerged from the lawyers house he walked rapidly keep-
 ing close in the shadows of the trees where practicable and often glancing
 j behind him until he reached the next street there with the agility of a
 coyote he darted around the corner leaped into a butchers cart held in wait-
 ing for him by patsey and instantly went clattering away at breakneck speed
 and behind brown dick

chapter xv -a friend in need

     the portentious incidents of that eventful day were not limited to rosas
 call upon miss holly and dabitzkys visit to the lawyer through still
 another strange happening promise dawned for elucidation of the mystery
 overhanging the fate of john roberts

    when the indemnity mutual insurance company started its energetic
 measures for self protection it had as mr darley supposed employed
 persons to obtain all possible information concerning every one known to have
 been associated with the missing man and at all likely to have an interest in
 what became of him or the resultants from his disappearance very
 naturally miss holly was at first an object of lively suspicion nobody
 else appeared upon whose behalf a claim of the insurance was so likely to be
 made

    of course it was not known whether john roberts had made any will
 or not but if he had nothing would be more probable than that he should
 have left everything to the girl he was about to marry for he was not a man
 of hobbies and it could not be learned that he had any family or even distant
 relatives and since every hypothesis had to be considered it was not to be
 looked upon as an utterly impossible thing that he having closed out his
 western business and being free might have engineered his own disappear-
 ance with her complicity to defraud the company as a preliminary to leaving
 the country and joining her abroad men had done such things

     the actuary talked the case over exhaustively with his friend the chief
 medical examiner who was the oldest officer in the companys service and
 kept him informed upon the progressive steps in the investigation energetically
 prosecuted by their agents in this way dr buchanan-the examiner in
 question-knew of the suspicions against miss holly and how thoroughly they
 had been dissipated by perfected knowledge of her character and that of her
 lover and a strong sympathy sprang up in the good old mans heart for
 the unhappy girl alone in the great selfish city almost friendless and
 burdened by such deep affliction he had daughters of his own and tears
 stood in his eyes as he thought of the possibility of their being placed in her
 situation that her intended husband had been murdered for purposes of
 robbery and would never be found again even as a corpse he deemed but too
 probable and the contemplation of her melancholy future clouded by grief
 and in all likelihood embittered by poverty saddened him he resolved to
 make her acquaintance console and befriend her and to this end procured
 from mr darley-whom he knew well-a note of introduction which he pre-
 sented within a couple of hours after the false mrs roberts had left her
ioo

an impromptu conspiracy

   ethels eyes were red and her face swollen with weeping but she had so
far regained command over herself that she received him with the calm and
kindly gravity characteristic of her under ordinary conditions words were
not needed to assure her that he was a friend worthy of her respect and con-
fidence  her reawakened psychic consciousness made that one of the things
she   simply knew  

   i am glad you have come sir she said i have just had a very
terrible experience that should be made known to mr darley but it has left
me too weak to go out

    if you will tell me about it i will certainly do anything i can to help
you he said

   clearly vividly she narrated to him the circumstances of the strange
womans visit and the astounding pretensions she had made mentioning also
her own consciousness at the close of the interview of the real character
of the bold imposter i was so weak and shaken when brought to my
senses she concluded that i had to lie down i was overcome by the
appalling fact she so daringly avowed that mr roberts is in her hands and
at her mercy she is i am sure the woman who claimed to be his wife at
the police station and under that pretense carried him off but she is not his
wife she is a creature of infinite perversity and wickedness who would not
hesitate to take his life any more than she has scrupled to lake his name to
serve her own ends  

     how do you know that my child    asked the old doctor eying her
keenly

    i cannot tell you i know it as i know that i live that sunshine is
light that you mean no harm to me i just feel it in my heart

    i thought so i believed at sight of you that you are gifted with a
highly sensitive psychic nature and what you say confirms me in that impres-
sion have you ever before had such intuitive consciousness concerning
persons   

    almost always under normal conditions but during this great trouble
until today nothing has seemed clear to me even my impressions concern-
ing john have been clouded i felt confident that he was still alive that i
have known all the time and it has been some consolation to me if he were
dead i would know it but i have also felt constantly that he was in im-
minent danger and the thought has been almost maddening

   it is easy to understand wh your psychic sight has been obscured
the mental vibrations caused by your anxiety have been too violent if you
had strength of will sufficient to control them you would see now clearer
than before could ou at any time by fixing your thought upon your
fiance induce an objective realization of him-seem to see him with your
eyes  

    that has happened but only when i have been reading a letter from
him my impressions are not like that i do not seem to see the faces and
bodies and clothes of people but what they are like inside in their minds
and hearts it is very strange and has made me afraid sometimes  

    it should not it is the sight of the angels  the sight all pure souls
an impromptu conspiracy



will liave when freed from their clay dungeon  and you should rejoice in its
possession if you were less good than you are you would not have it

    as he spoke he stooped and picked up from the floor a ladys glove that
had fallen beside the table upon which he threw it ethel with a little
curiosity took it in her hand but at the instant of contact uttered a cry of
horror ah she exclaimed  it is hers  i see her again   and flung
it from her

    the doctor smiled and his eyes brightened scientific interest mingled
with his personal sympathy you are an excellent subject he said
almost with enthusiasm  splendidly sensitive i believe if you have the
courage to undertake what i am about to propose you will be able to do more
than any one else to unravel this mystery and find john roberts  

   for that i have the courage to do anything i would give my life to
save him

     i do not doubt it but you will simply be required to give your con-
sciousness for a time to resign its control to another person

    for a moment she looked troubled then asked  to you   

   yes

     i am willing 

   it is well that you should understand clearly what is purposed and
why i believe that in addition to the wonderful clairvoyant power often
manifested by persons in the hypnotic sleep the strong bond of sympathy
between you and him will be of great effect in aiding you to lead rescuers
to where he is in ordinary hypnotic experiments the subject simply obeys
the will of the operator this case must be different the hypnotee must
follow the direction of the impulse in her own soul  

     i am ready for the test at once

   i am not replied the doctor with impressive gravity i only
employ the power when the most serious reasons exist and then with ex-
treme precautions for i appreciate the awful responsibilities incurred by him
who takes into his keeping even for an instant the mind of another and i
am too prudent to invite certain risks inseparable from its exercise to-
morrow afternoon i will return here at this hour and if you are still of the
same mind we will make the attempt do not go out get as much rest as
you can and bring your brain to as placid a condition as possible by the time
i return i will notify mr darley and others concerned of that womans
visit to you and her pretensions you will not need to worry about her any
more until tomorrow i bid you good by

    while thus from two directions inimical forces threatened to converge
upon the conspirators for the destruction of their well laid and hitherto suc-
cessful plans they in happy confidence of triumph deemed themselves prac-
tically within reach of the prize for which they had taken such desperate
chances while madame mettre was learning from miss holly who was be-
hind her lavish offer of reward her husband was rejoicing in possession of a
will that was in its way a masterpiece of nefarious art it purported to be
a holograph and had john roberts been in full possession of his senses he
would have hesitated to affirm after the most careful inspection that he had
ioo

an impromptu conspiracy

not unconsciously penned it with his own hand every delicate feature and
small peculiarity of his chirography had been preserved ind he could not
himself have defined with nicer precision of detail every item of his estate
all of which it devised to his  beloved wife rosa marie roberts

    it is beautifully done   she said in almost envious admiration of the
consummate skill in rascality which it demonstrated

    and note observed her husband  that it is written upon paper bear-
ing the water mark of a chicago firm of law stationers and that i have two
sheets more of the same to put among his papers one of them bearing a rough
draft of part of the will also in his hand and as carefully executed as the
finished document that shows what it is to have things done by a finished
artist one who knows what he is about and takes pains it is only a little
thing and may never have to be brought to light but what a strong bit of
presumptive argument will base itself upon such a circumstance  

    i see it is lovely one can have confidence in a man who thinks of
things like that

    and as he has an eye to his ten thousand yet to get lie makes smooth
the way to probate of the will having been disbarred some years ago for
some trifling occurrence of which prejudiced cognizance was taken he cannot
himself appear to offer it but he has given me a note to a lawyer still in
good standing who will take charge of it and if necessary make affidavit that
it was put in his hands by mr roberts who was his client i am to see
him and give it to him tomorrow 

    then what is to prevent our making a finish of it tomorrow night  

    nothing that i am aware of everything is ready now and it cannot
make any difference to him when he dies

    but it will to me i am tired of seeing him he bores me

    you had better call dr metcalf in during the forenoon and impress
upon him that his patient is failing fast and it will be well to fix mr
roberts up a little to receive him with a few drops of that blue aniline ink
make a wash with just a faint tinge of color and apply it around his eyes and
on his cheeks to make him more cadaverous looking then put his hands in
a basin of ice water just before the doctor is let in it will give a good effect
when his pulse is felt with those helps you will be able i have no doubt
to make the young fool believe the man is actually dying or at most will
only last a few hours and his testimony may be of use to us in case his
science proves correct as i think it will

    for once responded madame mettre with a smile  science will have
what you call  a sure thing  

     the memory of that insurance comes back to me f ifteen thousand
the pang is bitter that we shall have to abandon it it would do us so much
good

    believe me my dear ernest it is for the best that coifipauy prepares
itself for a fight and we cannot afford too close inquiry into our affairs it
will wait for us to attack by a claim then it will crush us that is its
program but if we remain quiet we will be able to secure all the rest and
be out of the country while it is still waiting
an impromptu conspiracy



    yes you are no doubt right i can see it but the sacrifice is one to
cause grief all the same

    do not think of it nothing hurts that you do not think of replied
madame rosa  i suppose it would not look well to have the funeral in less
than a couple of days   

     no that will bring it on sunday  a good day i will go down to the
city and get mourniag for you on friday monday the will may be offered
for probate there will be no contest for that girl will not dare to open her
head if she happens to learn anything about it which she probably will not
within a month we shall have possession and with our pockets full be en
route for paris

   aha  paris again at last with means to enjoy a good long well
earned holiday  it is elysium that opens before us  

chapter xvi-the meeting at the cottage

   on dr buchanans second visit to miss holly he was accompanied by a
gentle sweet faced girl whom he introduced as  my daughter lizzie and a
stalwart young man made known as  mr burnham from the office he
did not think it worth while to explain that mr burnham was an officer
whose especial value lay in his strength and courage the doctor rightly
judged that upon such an enterprise as he was about to engage in the backing
of a stronger force than two weak girls might be desirable mr darley he
regretted to say could not be present as he had a prior engagement what
that engagement was may be inferred from the fact that among the  per-
sonals  in that evenings news was one consisting of only the three words 
 reliable-agreed-ten

   before we begin said the doctor to ethel  i may as well explain to
you that young woireu upon recovering from the hypnotic state are some-
times subject to hallucinations such as much more frequently occur after
insensibility produced by anaesthetics i have therefore deemed it proper
to have my daughter as well as mr burnham present to witness all that
takes place

   ethel did not understand clearly what he meant but satisfied that what-
ever it might be the old man was probably right nodded her acquiescence

   now he continued we will proceed you are all ready forgoing
out  

    all but my hat and cloak

    lizzie will put them on you when we are ready to start will you let
me have one of those letters you spoke of yesterday   

    willingly she answered rising and procuring one which she gave to
him

    this glove may also be of use possibly he remarked taking from his
pocket the one he had picked up the day before

    oh   exclaimed miss holly with a shudder  thats what became of
it i sought it everywhere to have the girl throw it into the fire

    i supposed you would so took the precaution of securing it even if

      d

an impromptu conspiracy

we have no occasion to use it it was better away from you last night now
put yourself in an easy position and look steadily into my eyes

   after a few minutes of stillness and silence the doctor leaned forward and
made several downward passes before the girls face as he did so her eyes
closed he waited a little then made some simple tests of her condition
raising an arm lifting an eyelid for a glance at the pupil beneath and noting
her pulse the result seemed to satisfy him

    can you hear me perfectly  answer the old doctor said in a voice of
authority

   yes

    you will hear only my voice and obey me 

     i will

      can you see the writer of this letter  

      i-i cannot he is not here  

    seek him take this letter in your hand you must find him i will
it well have you found him 

   he spoke slowly commandingly with a short pause between his phrases
at first ethels face wore a troubled expression the brows knitting as if she
were puzzled or endeavoring to concentrate her thought then she manifested
much mental distress her lips quivered and tears ran down tier cheeks

     oh    she moaned   how he is changed  it is terrible  how he
must have suffered he will die john john her excitement in-
creased as she went on and climaxed in her screaming utterance of the
name

   be calm interposed the doctor renewing his passes control
yourself or i will not let you see him any more now then  that is
better have courage remember you must save him you can do
nothing unless you are calm will you be tranquil now  

    i will try yes i will obey you

    nowr look again find him and tell me what you see

    he is lying in a low arm chair he looks like a corpse and aeems un-
conscious two persons are in the room with him a small man who is very
bad and that horrible woman

      the woman to whom this belongs    asked the doctor lightly touching
her hand with the glove

    she shivered and in a voice of intense loathing and fear replied    yes 
yes  it is she the murderess  

   she became excited making feeble aimless gestures and emitting inar-
ticulate cries like one in a nightmare until the doctor restrained and soothed
her oh   she moaned weeping  they mean to kill him i saw it in
their eyes he is helpless and they will murder him  

   no said the doctor in a tone of confidence you will save him
but you cannot unless you control yourself you must be calm can you
lead us to him  

     i do not know it is very far  

    you must it is to save him

    i will try yes i will
an impromptu conspiracy

ion

     good  you are brave now control yourself and you will be strong
let us go at once

   she rose and moved toward the door but the doctor detained her long
enough for his daughter to put on her hat and cloak then they went out to
the doctors carriage burnham who had received no hint of what was to
happen and had never seen anything of the sort before walked like a man
in a dream the girls appearance and strange speech alarmed him and he
even felt a creepy sensation as he looked at the good old doctor so
bland yet wielding such awful and mysterious power he preferred to ride
 the box with the driver

   in the carriage dr buchanan asked of the hypnotee   which way shall
we go  

   uptown very far

      on the east or west side   

    the west

    you must direct us from time to time and check us if we go wrong

     i will if i can

    you must it is to save him and i will it

     i will

   and so they continued  through the maze of streets under the guidance
of ethel in her hypnotic state

   leaving theito pursue their way it will be well to see what was the out-
come of mr darles enigmatic communication to his midnight visitor through
the evening paper he was not disappointed labitzky presented himself
soonafter dusk in a better mood for giving all the help he could than the
lawyer had ventured to hope the jew had thought the situation over wtell
and was not only resolved that nothing should stand in the way of his getting
those ten thousand dollars but was convinced that his own personal safety
demanded the seizure of the conspirators he would even give his personal
aid to their capture if necessary for even a damaged reputation among his
patrons would be preferable to finding some night an avenging knife among
his ribs

   the wintry day had dropped into the edge of night when mr darley
having made elaborate preparation for what he surmised might be a long
and cold ride stepped into labitzkys coach accompanied by a man he did
not trouble himself to introduce indeed he could not have given any formal
introduction if even he had been so minded for he did not know the name of
the informer and the jew was not conscious of any lapse of courtesy he
habitually moved among men who are chary about giving their real names
and look upon undue curiosity as a reprehensible perhaps the only real vice

    i suppose its all right as we agreed last night it should be if the ad
appeared   he saic in a low tone to mr darley as that gentleman presented
himself at the coach door

    yes it is all right keep your part of the bargain and we will keep
ours  

    jump in then sir weve a longish way to go

   patsey slammed the door and as if starting in a race brown dick and


an impromptu conspiracy

mate struck into a swift long stride trot and although neither party was
aware of it a race really was on

   of the two carriages thus directed toward the same point the doctors had
the disadvantage of going themore slowly owing to the manner in which its
course was directed but the more than counterbalancing advantage of nearly
an hours start and the route it pursued was at least as direct as if the
driver had known his way in advance instead of being dependent upon orders
communicated to him from time to time through the little speaking tube in-
side the vehicle indeed some delay wras occasioned by the clairvoyants
disposition to prescribe an air line without reference to the hindrance offered
by blocks of buildings several times she said they were going wrong when
they were of necessity traversing long squares of right angles to their line of
general direction when this was understood however and duly allowed
for there was no more difficulty and they got along swiftly enough but as
they neared the cottage where john roberts was secreted ethels excitement
became so great that dr buchanan felt compelled to awake her from the hyp-
notic sleep and put her in lizzies charge this he did the moment he was
able to elicit from her any coherent assurance that the house before which
their carriage halted was the one of their destination

   the party alighted and looked earnestly about them everything was
quiet and none of the inmates of the house seemed to be cognizant of the
arrival of the carriage	m

   leaving the two girls in the shelter of the vehicle the doctor and burn-
ham entered the grounds and approached the low windows of the well lighted
parlor the curtains were dropped but one had fallen upon the back of a
chair which held it out of place and permitted a view of the room

   a wan ghastly looking man reclined in a deep chair before the fire at
a table a little behind him stood a man and a woman-mr and mme
mettre-the former in the act of letting fall from a tiny vial some colorless
drops into a glass of water held by the latter

   the doctor intuitively realized the situation and in a hoarse agitated
whisper said to burnham-a man of deeds who needed no second telling 

  stop them  get in there  at once   

   with a short run and a leap the young athlete hurled his heavy
weight against the front door of the cottage bursting it from its hinges with
a crash and sending it flying down the little lialhvay the next second he
was in the parlor with the doctor close at his heels and the two girls follow-
ing ethel seeing nothing but the wreck of the man she loved uttered a
shriek and fell upon her knees beside the chair with her arms about him
calling to him in endearing terms

   at that precise instant labitzkys coach stopped before the door and its
occupants excited by the sounds of turmoil that had reached them leaped
out and ran to the garden gate meanwhile mettre who had already corked
the vial startled by burnhams tornado like invasion dropped it upon the
table and evading the clutch by which the young man attempted to seize him
sprang headlong through the window carrying the sash with him the
three men who had arrived by the second carriage were between him and the
an impromptu conspiracy



gate when he recovered himself from his fall as the light from the window
fell full upon his face patsey recognized him and screamed thats
him  thats the divil  catch him  

   labitzky who was nearest sprang upon him and they fell together in
an instant the jew uttered a shriek of  murder   and mettre struggled to
his feet with blood covering his right hand and dripping from a long knife it
grasped but before he could take one step in flight the crack of a pistol
rang out and he fell again to rise  more the man accompanying mr
darley had shot him down he and eabitzky died at the same moment

   meanwhile madame mettre with rage and despair in her heart realized
that in an instant at the very moment of supreme confidence in the realiza-
tion of her hope destruction had overwhelmed her  that not only wtere her
well laid plans shattered tut that all life for her would henceforth be in the
cold gray horror of a prison cell escape wtas impossible before one door
stood the man who had burst his way in  at the other two more men  in
front of the window the doctor and outside it she knew not what possibly
ernest dead turning her back to her captors she covered her face with
her hands and seemed to weep in the excitement of the moment attention
was directed away from her while preparations were made to make john
roberts comfortable

    ethel  dear ethel  i knew you would come to me whispered john
roberts to the dear girl who pillowed his head upon her breast and kissed
his brow in a weak voice and with few words for he was very feeble he
told that he had been fully conscious for two or three days but had simulated
utter prostration in the hope that he might regain his strength sufficiently
to make a fight for his life before his progressive recovery wras suspected
he knew perfectly from the conversation his captors carried on unrestrain-
edly in his presence that they meant eventually to murder him but had not
known when until that morning and as they measured out the death
drops that would kill and yet leave not a trace he was endeavoring to nerve
himself to grasp the poker just within his reach when deliverance came

   a heavy fall upon the floor startled the listeners who were giving their
strained attention to his thrilling whispers madame mettre had escaped
the body that had been hers lay a corpse before them she had had the
presence of mind to snatch up and conceal the vial of poison and under cover
of her pretended weeping easily found opportunity to drain it of its deadly
contents many times enough to rid her of life

   john roberts leonine constitution enabled him ultimately to recover en-
tirely from the effects of the poison but not for a long time fortunately
the purpose of his intending assassins to keep him alive until such time as
their plans should be complete had made them cautious in the administration
of the second and third doses so that although the effects upon him were
terrible they were not of a nature to destroy his great vitalityor permanently
affect his mind he married ethel holly as soon as he was able to utter the
responses loud enough for an officiating clergyman to hear

the end
the bride of his ducal highness

what befell when the princess olga met the secretary of the grand duie-the tragic out-
come of an inopportune attachment-a strange ceremonial tle court
chaplain was called upon to perform

phe betrothal of the princess olga of rothenburg schwerin and the
grand duke leopold of meizweich holstein had just been announced
in tire residenz stadt and the city was decked in gala colors to welcome him

   on all sides were heard approval and contentment to unite his own
small dominion with the larger adjoining one of the grand duke had been
a long cherished dream of prince heinrich of rothenburg schwerin a vague
hope of all his kinsmen the duchy of meizweich holstein was a rich and
powerful one and one of the emperors most cherished provinces the grand
duke himself a courteous gray haired man of fifty was slight and of frail
build but gracious and charming and well beloved by all who knew him
widely traveled and a great student he had devoted most of his life to his
books until warned by his approaching years that he was still a bachelor and
without an heir he realized the importance of a speedy marriage and was
aroused to look for a suitable bride it seemed as if he could do no better
than to seek nearest his home and pluck the fair flower of the house of
rothenburg from the parent stem and so he had come with only his per-
sonal staff and his secretary to see for himself this young princess whom he
had heard spoken of in such glowing terms

   student that he was a sight of her fresh girlhood moved him strangely
and roused within him some of the forgotten vigor of his youth he found
himself anxious to press his suit eager to secure his prize and fortune
favored him the prince met him half way the townspeople showered
honors upon him  and sweet princess olga herself seemed content to accept
her fathers choice the princes dead wife had been a devout catholic and
although she outwardly accepted the lutheran faith of her husband she had
contrived to have princess olga go as a child to the good nuns who had
brought her up to womanhood wisely and well and sent her back to her
fathers court with a heart as fresh as the roses on her cheeks and a soul as
unsullied as her eyes

   it was early in the autumn the leaves were just turning gorgeous colors
and the winds blowing keener from the north and in the palace the great log
fires burned everywhere the princess olga ran lightly down the broad
stairway her lips parted smilingly bent upon seeing her father to plead the
cause of a poor wretch who had come to her notice and whose need touched
her warm heart she felt sure of her success knowing in vhat high favor
her father held her now that she had consented to a marriage with the grand
duke and had already promised to let it be in the near future

she knocked on the door of the princes sitting room and waited  and
the bride of his ducal highness



then she pushed it open and entered a young- officer got up hastily from
the desk where he was writing and stood facing her his hand resting on the
papers beside him she looked gently at him and smiled her own gracious
smile

   ah she said i did not know any one was here she held her
beautiful head erect her slim fingers clasped lightly in front of her her
reddish brown hair parted over her brows was twisted in a loose knot on her
neck her browu eyes full of innocent surprise rested on him lingeringly
they met his full of warm undisguised admiration he spoke german
fluently but with a slight accent

    the gracious highness will pardon my being here it is by the order
of the prince i am the secretary of his ducal highness the prince has
taken him to the stock farms she smiled cordially threw her head a trifle
back and looked at him from under her lashes

    then you are the englishman  she said

   her very presence sent a curious new sensation through him and he drew
in his breath quickly

    i am wallingford he replied  the gracious highness honors me in
remembering that i am an englishman he waited a trifle stiffly knowing
that etiquette demanded of him nothing but that but princess olga drew
a step nearer

    how did you know who i was  she asked pie closed his eyes sud-
denly

   i saw the gracious highness a year ago when i came to rotlienburg
schwerin  

   where was i interrupted the princess wallingford realized the
novelty of the situation and wondered vaguely why it was not strange
somehow it seemed quite natural that he should talk to her and he smiled
back at her

   the gracious highness was skating he said with the young duke
of gotha and- he stopped

     well said the princess imperiously  go x

   she leaned forward her face alight with life and youth the faint per-
fume around her floated over to him  it sent a fume like wine to his head
he pulled himself together suddenly

      the gracious highness will forgive me   he said   i have forgotten
the rest	

   she looked at him and then she said slowly in english   that is not
true you mean you do not wish to tell me she spoke with a charming
suspicion of faint accent she had learned her english at the convent and
was a trifle proud of it the sound of his own tongue spoken by her was a
revelation and he forgot that she was a princess and he in rotlienburg
schwerin and answered her in english quickly you were annoyed
with him and left him and skated alone a faint frown touched her
straight eyebrows he was very insolent she said i remember it
well she looked at wallingford taking in his tall broad figure his saxon
head and frank gray eyes his clean shaven well shaped mouth with its
ioi

the bride of his ducal highness

sensitive corners and firm under lip she continued  i do not like him at
all he would talk to me of nothing but love

    and is that a crime  said wallingford gravely her eyes fell  i
thought so then she replied

    and now  asked wallingford

    and now i do not know she murmured wallingford lost his head a
trifle

   think he said think he laughed nervously

    i am writing the announcement of the betrothal to meizweich holstein
the girls face whitened suddenly ah she exclaimed  i had forgot-
ten that must it be told so soon 

   a great wave of pity swept over wallingford and he came across to her
and spoke in english  they told me it was your wish and that you gave
your hand willingly-that you were happy surely that is so tell me
he bent forward anxiously

   she seemed so young and so fair  and he realized suddenly that which
made his heart beat alas for rothenburg etiquette and the formalities of
the ducal court at meizweich holstein  the princess olga w ith a heart beat-
ing until it fairly stifled her and a pair of great brown eyes full of tears
proved too much for the grand dukes secretary he forgot everything
ah little girl he said dont cry it hurts me to see you do it
please the princess olga bent her head lower through her throbbing
heart darted wonderful delicious unknown tremors of happiness she put
out her hand impulsively and he took it in both his and then bending he
kissed it hotly again and again alas for the grand duke gravely and
politely admiring the stock farms of the prince  joutli and love and beauty
were against him  and the little princess olga realized it suddenly

   shall i see you again she asked timidly and wallingford with his
heart in his eyes said

    i know i have no right but yes yes a thousand times tonight at the
ball

   that night the princess olga radiant with jewels and satins received
gravely the congratulations of her fathers court prince heinrich unbent
wonderfully his contentment shining in every line of his broad red face and
his satisfaction beaming out of his small eyes near him stood the grand
duke surrounded by his aides and among them his magnilicent shoulders
towering above the others wallingford in the pale blue broadcloth and white
shoulder straps of konigin olgas dragoons under his smoothly parted hair
his brain seemed on fire he watched the princess taller and more stately in
her long satin gown and envied the diamonds on her round white throat the
star in her soft hair

   so suddenly had this taken possession of him that it seemed to drive all
before it and to him there was but one thing in the world to be desired and
that one thing beyond his reach old facher the court chaplain looked at
him intently and followed the gray eyes which rested on the princess noted
keenly the repression of the englishmans mouth and the slight heaving of
his shoulders wiser than any man at court he drew back and watched
the bride of his ducal highness

ioi

   the dancing had begun the princess turned gaily to the grand duke
 i mean to dance with all of your aides he smiled graciously

    do my dear  lie said  and remember they will be your aides before
long she danced with three of them and returned each time to the grand
duke who greeted her smilingly she had grown very dear to him in this
short time and he loved to see her treat him as if she knew he sympathized
with her every mood and fancy and at the next dance he turned to her

    you have forgotten wallingford he said  and wallingford is not
to be forgotten i took such a liking to him in london that i persuaded him
to come to meizweich holstein and live with me you must be very nice to
wallingford olga because he is so loyal to me and i am fond of him ted
the princess is to dance this with you wallingford started suddenly

     if you will forgive me your grace he said  i fear i do not dance the
german step tiie duke laughed lightly

    nonsense he said  ive seen you dance at home come ted the
princess is waiting and pleasantly smilingly he sent them off together
and facher the chaplain shook his wise old head and looked after them
the music of the waltz was full of a heavy under current it hummed in
wallingfords ears and drowned his voice as he spoke to her

      the gracious highness- 

    no  she said  speak english to me and be english too i an
weary of german   still he insisted

     i have no right

    she looked up at him as they danced

    i give you the right she said  forget that i am a princess and be
ourself  he drew her closer

    do you know my head is gone he said  completely i cannot talk
to you i must not her hair touched his brow as they waltzed he shiv-
ered slightly and drew back

     if you were the grand duke she said softly  what would you do  

     i would be the happiest man in the world

      and now    she asked he shrugged his shoulders

      what difference can it make   

     listen she said  it is  time for such words we have only a few
moments to speak why will you not be yourself 

    then he spoke to her rapidly and without choosing his words

   i will do as you say you have driven me quite mad i love you
olga i love you so that i am afraid to look at you if only you were a lit-
tle english girl no one should part us no one should see you or have you
or touch you but just i myself but you know it is impossible all of it
and i am a disloyal friend and yet i cannot keep silent why did you come
to the library today  

     it is fate said the girl gravely  and i-i am glad i came

    she raised her head and looked over his shoulder at the grand duke
what is your name she asked is it ted that was what he
called you it is a dear quaint little name ted she repeated it softly
and lovingly
ioi

the bride of his ducal highness

      do not say it again he said  i cannot bear it for one moment
 longer he held her and then the music ceased and he took her back to
 the grand duke facher the chaplain came up to him and touched him on
 the shoulder

    come he said tell me of london i was there many years
 ago  

     the next day the princess olga sat looking listlessly out of her window
 when her maid johanna came in breathlessly

     ah highness dear highness   she cried  such a dreadful thing has
 happened olgas heart seemed to contract suddenly

    what she asked tell me at once the tears rolled down
 johannas rosy cheeks

     it is so sad she said the tall young englishman the secretary
 of his ducal highness he is dying and at my mothers highness they
found him in the park and brought him to her because her house was nearest
i was at home when he came the doctors say he will surely die  

     the princess stood erect stiffly her white lips apart her feet seemed
 turned to stone johanna continued   he shot himself through the lungs
 and heart he is so handsome and so young she sobbed loudly her round
 blue eyes full of sorrow then the sight of her mistress face startled her

 	highness she said i am a crazy girl i have frightened you
 she put a strong arm around the princess who swayed forward olga raised
 her hands to her throat and pulled at her gown  i cannot breathe she
 gasped  i am choking and just then faclier came in softly through the
 antechamber he strode over and loosened the ribbon at her neck then his
 kindly eyes met hers pityingly

    so he said you know already my daughter i had come to tell
 you

    at old nurse waclitmanns the wounded man moved uneasily the
 woman moistened his lips  olga he said faintly  olga she soothed
 hiin gently 

    quiet my boj she said she shall come never fear she
 answered a knock on the door to find facher with a lady on his arm

     you herr pastor she said the doctors have just gone they
 say they can do nothing but they will return in an hour he grows
 rapidly worse and calls for  olga olga 

    and i have brought her said the chaplain  i know you can be
 trusted for you love her well

     the old nurse took the long cloak from the princess shoulders and un-
 wound the lace scarf from her head and face then she started- is it you
 he cries for my princesschen she said  alas  poor boy

     the princess pointed to the door unsteadily yes said the chaplain
  he is in there you can go to him  nothing can hurt him now

     she pushed it open he saw her at once and moved his head restlessly
 on the pillows his lips smiling at her she knelt beside him and laid her
 face against his hand he tried to stroke her bent head but failed miser-
 ably
the bride of his ducal highness



   little one he said faintly i didnt make a success of it did i
my hand wasnt steady i meant to have it all over in a moment i knew
you would understand i thought of it all night and i was nearly mad
i could not live and see you go to him it was the only thing to do dear
now i can be loyal and still die loving you

   ted she said  my heart is broken i cannot live if you die get
well for me to make me happy

   and for what  he said i could never be anything to tou and
olga i shall not get well i am weaker every hour will you make me a
promise  

    anything you ask of me

    keep your word he said  marry the grand duke i know him so
well to be kind and good and brave he will be very tender of you dear and
gentle with you he is the noblest man i have ever known i wish i
might see him again  his voice grew fainter she looked up

    i cannot cannot bear it she said the chaplain came in gud bent
over him

    do you know me my son  he asked wallingford nodded

    you were so good to bring her to me he said  let her stay a little
longer he stretched out his hand to her and she laid hers in it lovingly

    marry me to him she said to the chaplain  i want to be his wife
wallingfords eyes lighted

   if it could be he murmured but the old priest shook his head
i dare not he said  it wrould be against all law or reason you are a
princess she held out her hands beseechingly

   dear dear herr pastor she said for once let me cease to be
princess let me be only woman   he closed the door

    gods blessing can do no harm to you he replied and there as wal-
lingford lay dying the princess olga of rothenburg schwerin was made his
wife when it was over the chaplain turned to her

   you must come away at once he said the doctors will return
and i expect the grand duke any moment the have sent to the hunting
box for him i have done too much now he crossed himself piously

  may i be forgiven when all sins are j udged   

   she leaned over wallingford despairingly

    ted she said  i am your wife do you know that call me so once
before i go but his eyelids closed flutteriugly she bent and kissed him

   it is forever dear   she said   ah heaven can you do nothing  
but wallingford was dead

   old facher wrapped her veil and cloak closely around her and put her in
the carriage where johanna waited and just as it drove out of sight the
grand duke on horseback his face white and alarmed rode up to the little
house and dismounted the nurse made way for him and the chaplain fol-
lowed him into the room

    here is a line he wrote for your grace when he was first brought here
he wrote it with great difficulty and it is hardly legible i promised him i
would give it to jtou


my ladys boudoir

        the duke took the paper silently but after he read it he bent over the
    dead man with a bitter cry

      ted why did you do it if only i had known before but
   wallingford his fair hair curling-  his brow lay white and still

        no one saw the princess olga that night but the next day the grand duke
    asked her to receive him he found her looking very ill but she gave him
    one small cold hand and raised her brow for his kiss

         you come to ask me to set the date for our marriage she said

        he drew her to the sofa and sat beside her   i did not come for that
   today he said but i would gladly hear that i have sad news to tell
   you one of my aides my secretary wallingford he faltered  is dead

  he-he-shot himself-

         yes she said  i have heard it she closed her eyelids wearily
    and i have come to ask of you a great favor olga that poor boy
    wrote me a line before he died and told me of a woman he loved a
    young girl like you olga and like you of noble rank he loved her
    more than his life and she will never know it dear it is all such a
    tragedy and so pitiful she looked in front of her as he spoke her hands
    clasped tightly

   i want you to do for him olga what his sweetheart would do-if she
knew to put the flowers around him and to go with me tomorrow to his
funeral i promised his old mother in england that i wtould look after him
i have failed utterly i must have been blind not to see i am very
unhappy olga for i loved him will you do what i ask  

   she looked up at him her eyes full of tears  you are good good she
said i will go and do-what she would have done

   and so it was that wallingfords wife in deepest black and leaning 
the grand dukes arm followed him to his last resting place

a month in the moon

the marvelous experiences that grew out of the lunar company limited-how the catch-
penny scheme of three adventurers was transformed into an extraordinary
contribution to the world of science-scenes and incidents
of a sojourn on the earths satellite

    messrs gryphins vogel and wagner tlie tliree unscrupulous agents of tlie electric
transmission co of melbourne australia being down to their last dollar receive an unex-
pected windfall in the shape of a sale of thirty shares of stock for cash to one tyrrel smith
valet to sir bucephalus coghill with this nest egg in hand wagner who is something of a
scientist conceives the idea of starting the lunar company for the conquest and exploration
of the mineral riches of the moon

    the scheme is extensively advertised and shares of stock are eagerly snapped up  but
how are we to get to the moon   is the natural question asked by large numbers of these stock-
holders and at last a public meeting is called and wagner whose sole object lias been to get
money undertakes to satisfy the clamor he talks learnedly of a tubular tunnel but has his
theory utterly demolished by norbert mauny a young frenchman who declares that in order to
complete such a piece of work within the stipulated time of five years it must rise at the rate of
 miles a year 

    the assemblage is panic stricken and the stockholders demand their money back when
mauny calls for order and announces hat he has a plan to propose quiet is restored and then
the young frenchman proceeds to explain a scheme he has had in mind for some time but has
lacked capital to carry out that of attracting the moon to the earth by erecting a series of
powerful magnets in a country especially adapted to such a design the idea is received with
enthusiasm and mauny is voted manager of the company the bayouda desert in the soudan
is selected as the site for the erection of the magnets the expedition sets out in the steamer
dover castle and seven months after the formation of the company reaches suakim here
mauny meets the french consul m kersain and his daughter gertrude who decide to ac-
company him  a visit to the mogaddem of rhadameh a iocal ruler whose favor must be
obtained before the transportation of tlie material across the desert can be made

    the mogaddem is a weird sort of personage and possesses a hideously ugly dwarf whose
eyes shoot fire from beh nd his glasses when he sees the party from suakim approaching after
promising to pay certain large sums as tribute norbert secures the cooperation he desires and
soon after the return to the seaport the expedition sets out for the bayouda desert gertrude
sadly watches it depart while her maid fatima sighs and says that there is more cause for wor-
riment than even her mistress supposes

chapter xi-the peak of tehbali

   ertrude could not but feel alarmed at the vague words of warning
     spoken by fatima

    what do you mean child  she asked

    if you only knew what i do mean  no one is afraid of me and so i
often find out things that the white men have no idea of if you only knew
what is coming  if you knew how the giaours unbelievers are detested 
a long way off near the lakes there is a great prophet who has come to
save the sous of allah  he is a real saint and no one can resist him he

a month in the moon

has sworn to exterminate every one of the europeans this is what the
arabs and men of the desert are saying they declare that all this will hap-
pen very soon perhaps within eight days that the signal will be given from
kordofan then there will be a grand massacre of the white men i was
longing to speak when you were all talking at dinner of the mahdi but i
didnt dare and then you sent me to fetch your fan

   exactly my child and if i had not sent you away you would have
heard my father say that a great army is preparing to march against the
mahdi

    oh  it will not be of any use you dont know how enraged they all
are even the porters on the quay they are saying that there must be an
end to the strangers in their land that the prophet has ordered the slaughter
of the infidels with many other things that would make your hair stand on
end  oh  do get away as soon as possib with the master and take fatima
she is the only one here that loves you  but what have i done   continued
the child  you are quite pale and i shall make you ill with my tales  
no little one i am not ill only very anxious what you say only
confirms the fears expressed by those who have experience in these matters
and it seems to me that i my-self have had my suspicions all along i dont
like my father to go out of the city  poor father  he will not leave egypt
i know  and i certainly will not leave him no matter what happens

    nor will i dear little mistress  but i am onl a child and perhaps i
have exaggerated the danger i was wrong to speak of it dont think of
it any more go to bed  it is late and the master would not be pleased if
he knew you were still up  

   seven mouths went by and contrary to all expectation nothing had
happened to justify fatimas fears the mahdi and his partisans seemed in
fact to be losing not gaining ground and the advance of an egyptian army
ten or twelve thousand strong from khartoum under hicks pasha had
driven him from his capital el-obeid and forced him to beat a retreat
towards the south

   meanwhile on the plateau of telibali the works directed by norbert
mauny progressed happily and well everything hitherto had gone as he
wished the indispensable magnetic pyrites abounded to such an extent in
the western desert of bayouda near darfour that whole mountains three
or four thousand feet in height were entirely composed of it norbert
chose the loftiest the peak of tehbali for the seat of the enterprise

   it was an immense crag of conical shape of perfectly homogeneous rock
and standing on a plateau two thousand yards square

   a few borings sufficed to show that the geological formation of tehbali
was all that could be desired the peak was indeed an enormous conical
shaped solid block of magnetic pyrites five thousand feet high

   nothing since the meeting in melbourne had given norbert so much
pleasure as the discovery of this peak with such perfect geological conditions
that he was spared the trouble of building an artificial mountain of magnetic
pyrites

    first of all it was necessary to put all the valuable apparatus under cover
a month in the moon



the machines and instruments had until now been deposited in ordinary
tents norbert began by making a zigzag road to the summit the surface of
which he leveled to the extent of three thousand square y a refs on this
esplanade he erected after the usual fashion buildings one story high in-
tended to serve as shops laboratories and dwelling places they were all
made of pyrites that had been dug out of the hill as the road went up
roofed with the same material they bristled like fortresses on the mountain
top

   the workmen came from darfour close by and the cherofa tribe were
also always willing to lend their aid thanks to the exertions of the inter-
preters mabrouki and virgil there were soon about twenty overseers to
hurry on matters this little army of workmen was easily provisioned from
the adjacent town of berber whilst their drinking water brought by regular
convoys of camels from the wells of onadi-teraib and abe klea a few
leagues distant was stored in zinc cisterns on the mountain top

   beneath the plateau of tehbali and its towering peak lay the arid sandy
plains of the great bayouda desert here and there were visible small tufts
of palm trees while to the west some white spots on the yellow ground indi-
cated the villages of central darfour and through the telescope the cupolas
and minarets of berber stood out  their own little green oasis northward
in the distance wound the nile its well wooded banks plainly discernible
and its blue waters shimmering now and again in the bright sunshine

chapter xii-visitors at tehbali

   at seven oclock on an october morning norbert was according to his
usual habit sitting on a camp stool before his desk when suddenly virgil ap-
peared

     visitors  visitors sir   he exclaimed in an agitated manner

    visitors   absently replied his master  what will you say next 

    indeed sir it is quite true there are ladies and gentlemen on horse-
back and quite a caravan with them i was in the wood yard half way up
the hill when i caught sight of them and i thought you would like to know
it betimes i could make out mile kersain with her little maid and her
father and the doctor

    you are dreaming replied norbert wrho got up however with alac-
rity and put his gla ss to his eye

      where are your visitors now   

     look sir there they are at the foot of the fifteenth zigzag

   one glance through his spy glass convinced norbert that it was indeed
the fact that mile kersain with her father and dr briet was approaching

    what good wind blows you here   cried the young astronomer when
they met  i can hardly believe my eyes that i really see mile gertrude
herself   

   it is true however said she lightly jumping off her horse with
norberts assistance  do you think that i would have allowed my father
to go to khartoum alone   


a month in the moon

    to khartoum  are you going there  

    we are answered m kersain as he dismounted  i have been ap-
pointed consul general in the soudan and naturally i take my daughter
with me

   well added briet you seem tolerably backward here as regards
news hicks pasha has succeeded in concentrating his army at khartoum
after eight months hard drill it is thoroughly well disciplined and the
mahdi has beaten a retreat toward the great lakes we shall hear no more
of the mahdi he has evaporated into thin air and the magic of his name
and fame are over forever you know how firmly i once believed in the
mahdi well i believe in him no more

   neither do you consul said norbert since you are taking mile
kersain to your new post  

    i scarce  believe in him now replied kersain  i am certain that
the pacification of the soudan is only a question of time and i expressed
myself to that effect in my official reports as there is a grand field for french
commerce here the minister saw the matter in the same light  and i was
ordered to khartoum where gertrude insists on accompanying me

    of course replied his daughter  am i not also an official person-
age you must know that papa prides himself on these reports help
him with them  i own it is partly with a view to seeing khartoum and
perhaps also to get a peep at the peak of tehbali but i had no idea it was
like this it is simply splendid  

    gertrude was in truth quite delighted to find herself at tehbali and she
did not try to hide her feelings she could hardly contain her delight when
thej- crossed the threshold of the observatory and entered the large vaulted
hall that tyrrel smith had transformed for the nonce into a beautiful draw-
ing room

   we are explained norbert in the hall of motors as we term
it because all the conducting wires meet here and are under the control of
those two ivory knobs yonder but we will show you all that by and by
you must have some refreshments now

   a well appointed table stoodaid out in the middle of the hall which was
carpeted with woolen stuffs and furnished with broad divans of embossed
camel skin the walls were adorned with drawings of the heavens togo-
graphical charts and large lunar photographs through folding doors at
the end of the hall there was-a glimpse of astronomical apparatus a large
globe telescopes electric batteries and strange looking instruments of all
kinds

   gertrude got up from the table to examine some of the charts hung on
the walls of the   hall of motors  

    what is that  she asked looking attentively at a kind of map of the
world whose seas and continents she failed to recognize

    that is a general map of the moon replied norbert  or rather of the
lunar hemisphere visible to us  

   how a map of the moon cried gertrude has any one been
there   
a month in the moon



    that was not necessary in order to draw up this map it was quite suf-
ficient to observe the moon on fine nights and note all that happened on her
surface the geography of our satellite was verified by a great many obser-
vations made by several different astronomers

    but there are i see names on the maps  sea of tranquility  ocean
of tempests  chain of the apennines 

    they are bestowed by the observers themselves we can take photo-
graphs of the moon almost as easily as of a human being see  here is one
of the chain of lunar apennines taken by me a month ago can there be a
doubt as to its being a photograph of one of a long chain of mountains looked
at vertically as from the car of a baloon  

     it is astonishing  

    do you want another proof  look at this drawing exactly resembling
a volcanic island covered with craters a birds eye view as it were of the
peak of teneriffe is it not a striking likeness  

    so striking that it is impossible to doubt that the model must have been
similar but how did you manage to photograph an isolated chain i could
understand the whole surface but a part  

    you will have no difficulty in comprehending the whole matter if you
bear in mind that a telescope magnifying  fold brings our satellite within
one hundred and twenty miles so to speak of the observatory now the
moon appears enormous so near we can choose our portions and fix them
separately  the sensitive plate you know that a microscope photograph
can easily be enlarged and developed so as to show details previously invisible
to the naked eye

      how i should like to see all this myself  

     you shall see it and not later than this very night  the moon is at its
full and just fit for observation

     what will you really show me the chain of the apennines as it is
here and the ocean of tempests

    and a great deal more into the bargain

     it is indeed marvelous  

    you may call it marvelous if you like for my part i think it much
more marvelous that scarcely any one takes any notice of these wonders
then continued gertrude after a minutes silence  you really think
it possible that the moon should be like our earth should possess a similar
geological constitution and have like us continents seas mountains vol-
canoes 

     it is not only possible but probable and i may say certain that such is
the case do not forget that the moon is only a fragment of the earth de-
tached from her thousands or ten thousands of years ago at an epoch when
our globe was but a nebulous ball turning on its own axis the chemical
elements of the lunar soil must therefore necessarily be the same as ours
at most they may perhaps have formed different combinations or may be
differently distributed from the center to the poles but the probability is in
favor with their exact identity with the earth this does not of course
mean that life has manifested itself under the same forms-far from it

      e


a month in the moon

    the climate conditions of the moon are on the contrary entirely dif-
ferent from those of the earth by reason of her more restricted dimensions
her peculiar position and the fortnightly alterations of heat and cold through
which she passes

     it is not only probable but certain also that her vegetables and animals
are or were quite different from ours i do not say anything about her
atmosphere which exists i think though it must be very rarefied

   have you learned anything fresh about the subject lately asked
briet somewhat ironically

     yes  i have learned something fresh lately replied norbert gravely

  what do you suppose i am doing in the afternoons and evenings  i am
gazing at the stars as that is my business and i have been able to take sev-
eral observations in these clear skies on the whole i am inclined to believe
that the moon has an atmosphere but that it is so rarefied that human beings
could not live in it  

     if that is so cried the doctor  good by to your plans

    that remains to be seen replied norbert should the atmosphere
prove unbreathable we will try to substitute our own in its place and if we
do not succeed we will do without either of them   

chapter xiii-the details of the scheme

    the visitors had been intensely interested in all they had heard about the
plans but norbert refused to tell them any more until they had rested
not until sunset would he conduct his guests over his domain

    i am going he said to show you something very special but do
not expect any extraordinary machines or cabalistic preparations everything
here is of the greatest simplicity

     this he continued preceding his visitors into the gallery beyond the
 hall of motors  is my own private observatory you will find nothing
here that you could not see at paris or greenwich there is a movable
cupola turning  its own axis and following with this clock the apparent
movement of the heavenly bodies here are telescopes compasses chronom-
eters barometers-and that is all

     on the right you see a large laboratory with furnaces vessels and
reagents on the left is the depot for chemical products and also a most
necessary store of chlorate of potassium and those great zinc boxes with
straps round them making them look like so many cocoa tins are intended
to be filled with oxygen to enable us to breathe in any atmosphere even
under water or in a vacuum

      farther on is the store room for balloons and parachutes of different
sizes in case of necessity then there are the implements and instruments
of the principal professions lastly there are the provision stores which
occupy all the rest of the building they contain preserved meats tinned
vegetables wines biscuits dried fruits etc etc our cisterns made of zinc
cemented in concrete contain about four million gallons of water

    but there is nothing particularly interesting so far in a word we
a month in the moon



are in a fortified castle on one floor built of magnetic pyrites and duly
provisioned not only with the necessaries of life but with all the astro-
nomical meteorological and aerostatic requirements also with everything
needful in physics or chemistry and materials wherewith to manufacture any
article that may have been omitted there is nothing remarkable here up to
the present except the complete autonomy of our domain  in case of an attack
it could be as self sufficing as a well equipped ship or a besieged town to
complete the simile we have the wherewith to defend ourselves possessing
side arms pistols revolvers two gatling guns and four quick firing maxims

     so much for the outward organization and the general precautions
let us pass now to the technical wyorks incidental to the enterprise  

   he led them into a circular hall in the center of the buildings they saw
only a large black hole

    this hole said norbert  is simply a well i intend soon to have an
elevator here in order to get down to the bottom of the mountain in three
minutes i began to dig the hole soon after leveling the site  which stand
the buildings as i wanted to make sure of the geological structure of the
peak it goes down vertically to the depth of forty eight hundred feet with
a radius of two yards in this way i got to the base of the peak and ascer-
tained that it rests on a bed of sand and is entirely composed of the magnetic
pyrites i therefore resolved to make use of the magnetic rock as it is in-
stead of building an artificial mountain the well can be put to other uses
also as you will soon see

    you said something just now remarked m kersain  about a steam
engine for the purpose of boring this well where are the steam engines
and how did you manage to get the necessary fuel  

    you have hit upon the only possible drawback to our success replied
norbert smiling  the want of fuel was indeed a difficulty i will show
you how i got over it by a contrivance that is the verj turning point of the
whole enterprise

   they passed into a corridor leading to the broad circular passage between
the buildings and the outer rampart here in the open air and exposed all
day long to the tropical sunshine stood several dozen large copper reflectors

   each apparatus had in the center a boiler made of tempered glass and a
steam engine whose slightest movement could evidently set in motion various
conducting wires that stood arranged in readiness under a shed

    this is the solar heat condenser said norbert  it can gather up the
solar heat and utilize it it has already enabled us to bore our well and as
  shall see when we get to the foot of the mountain it kindles to a white
heat the group of furnaces that make large quantities of glass

    do you mean to say exclaimed briet  that this copper funnel can
develop sufficient heat to vitrify sand  

    it can replied norbert  this is our only heating apparatus your
cutlets this morning were grilled by the solar heat condenser the soup and
roast meat will be cooked by the same process this evening  

   but said gertrude laughingly you are obliged always to cook in
the daytime   


a month in the moon

     yes if we are foolish enough to suffer our store of heat to evaporate
into space not so if we take care to imprison it in a non conductor such as a
woolen covering or even a potful of sand virgil does this very cleverly i
assure you  

   it is marvelous cried m kersain this invention is certainly
destined to be of great service in africa   

    much greater than is thought replied norbert  remember this is a
free and unlimited force  by the solar action alone it will henceforward be
possible to sink artesian wells in the middle of the most arid desert to get
water from any depth bring it to the surface and make use of it as we will
railways can in future traverse the sahara desert and the whirr of busy
manufactories wake up its silent echoes while steamers plow the wave with-
out need to trouble about finding fuel the sun will do it all  this conical
funnel once set facing the sun the rest will go by itself and what more easy
than to so set it  the lever yonder enables the reflector to be moved back-
wards and forwards horizontally while the toothed rack by setting in motion
two cogs elevates or depresses it vertically the contrivance is so simple
that it could be learned in five minutes by a child of seven we will now
visit the lower works  

   leaving the circular passage they returned to the entrance gate where
saddle horses stood ready to take the travelers to the foot of the mountain
they got there in half an hour galloping past the camp of the workmen
consisting of tents huts and earthen cabins and drew rein in front of one
of the furnaces mentioned by norbert

   there are twenty five exactly like this one he said they sur-
round the base of the peak with a girdle of vitrifying furnaces you see
that the glass made is somewhat coarse and dull but it is perfectly adapted
for the end in view-to insulate the magnetic block which constitutes the
peak of tehbali the insulation will be effected by a vitrified layer of about
fifty inches in thickness

     how will you manage to make this  you may perhfps ask in the
simplest manner in the world-by pouring it round the base of the peak
there is no lack here of sand our chief constituent the solar heat enables me
to keep one hundred and twenty vitrifying furnaces in active work during
twrelve or fifteen hours a day bach of these furnaces produces on an
average two hundred cubic meters of glass that flows under the mountain as
fast as it leaves the crucibles by means of a horizontal tunnel to the centre
of the pyritic peak communicating with the well we are enabled to make the
flow continuous as soon as the unbroken sheet of glass has gone quite
round the centre the operation will be completed and the mountain entirely
insulated from its sandy bed

      how soon do you think this will happen    asked gertrude

      in about five or six months  

      that is a long while  

   it is rather long especially for the controlling commissioners of the
company said norbert with a sly glance at sir bucephalus but so
much the worse for them  i will not leave anything to chance and you may
a month in the moon



be quite sure tliat i am not going to hurry on matters just for the sake of
shortening their exile   

   norbert did not say how wagner gryphins and vogel had constantly
tried to spoil his plans with such open and acknowledged hostility that he
had been obliged to treat them as enemies and to forbid them to go near the
works of the observatory or even the provision stores for the last three
months indeed they had been kept in quarantine in their own quarters in
the left wing  and they were moreover warned that they would be seized
on the least suspicion of treason

   for their part they took good care not to leave of their own accord
they were quite determined to regain the control of the magnificent under-
taking that owed its first inception to them norbert mauny was they con-
sidered an interloper they were therefore willing to put up with any
affronts or inconveniences rather than give in

   a visit to one furnace sufficed to demonstrate the mode of operation
iu all and the merry cavalcade therefore took the road leading back to
the observatory

    if i have understood your explanation said kersain as they rode
along you intend finally to magnetize the moon by means of the solar
heat  

     precisely so

    your special aim at present is to isolate the block of tehbali on a rough
sheet of glass interposed between the base of the rock and its subsoil of sand
but what will be the use of this 

    i shall then have at my disposal an enormous mass of magnetic pyrites
that i can at once convert into a magnet 

    how 

    simply by means of the electric current the cable conductors are
already laid they all meet like the cables of my dynamos in the  hall of
motors the dynamos as i need hardly tell you will be set in motion by
the solar condensers which  longer needed at the base of the peak will
be posted at intervals along the circular passage when all the preparations
are complete and the day and hour fixed i shall only have to press one of
the ivory knobs in order to establish the contact at that instant the peak
of tehbali will become an immense magnet

  and then

    then irresistibly drawn by the additional terrestrial attraction the moon
will descend and place herself at our disposal  

chapter xiv-bad news

   seven weeks had passed since the presence of gertrude with her father
and the doctor had lent unwonted animation to life on the peak of tehbali
work had now resumed its regular and usual course  but norbert was dis-
 

turbed in mind by a singular fact which he could not help associating with
the fidvent of the dwarf rhadameh who for some reason or other had re-
cently seen fit to pay a visit to the peak the greater number of his


a month in the moon

cherofa workmen had abandoned him one by one just before the dwarf
came there were not less than eight hundred  now there were scarcely three
dozen  the others had all departed under one pretext or another

   the work did not suffer from these defections simply because crowds of
natives came from darfour to replace the deserters but it would have
become difficult to go on with the enterprise had it depended on the aid of the
cherofa tribe alone

   on the other hand the reports of virgil and mabrouki gave evidence of
great disaffection among the laborers and glass makers for the first time in
several months they were overheard conversing about the approaching advent
of a new golden age and the expected triumph of the faithful over the un-
believers to be followed by a general massacre of europeans

    virgil old soldier as he was treated all this bragging with supreme con-
tempt mentioning it only as a matter of duty  but mabrouki was evidently
much disturbed he had accompanied the first european explorers of the
upper nile and for nearly a year past now he had been norbert maunys
right hand norbert showed his appreciation of his good services by often
deferring to the old negro in the most flattering manner

   according to mabrouki the cherofas had a motive in deserting from the
workshop of tehbali they must have heen ordered to do so by the mogad-
dem and the affair was probably connected with the coming revolution

    mabrouki added that no confidence was to be placed in the thirty or forty
remaining cherofas especially a certain aben-zegri who had apparently
great influence among them to dismiss them at once would not be wise as it
might entail a complete rupture with their chief but they must be well
watched which would be his business

   noticing one evening an unusual concourse of people proceeding toward
the tent of the cherofas which was both large and lofty mabrouki took up
his post unperceived outside the outer wall of the tent and perceiving a
little hole in the canvas he enlarged it with his spear so that he could see all
that went on inside

   the deepest silence reigned the light of a smoky lamp shone upon fifty
arabs prostrate with their faces on the ground and their arms stretched out
before them motionless while their white draperies covered them as with a
shroud

   at first mabrouki thought he was witnessing their evening prayer  but
in an instant he beheld one of the arabs rise and advance to the middle of the
crowd it was aben-zegri in a loud voice he addressed a brief invocation
to the holy prophet mahomet and then he broached the subject of the meet-
ing

     men of the tribe of cherofa he said  beloved children of allah the
day of our deliverance is at hand the lord loves you at your birth the
winds were tempered the sea lost its fury and became soft as oil and the
moon was near the full allah to try you has subjected you to the hated
yoke of the unbelievers but soon you shall rise in triumph like unto lions
on the mountain tops and you shall crush them all in jour iron grip   

   at these wofds a frenzy of enthusiasm ran through the assembly
a month in the moon



   what o lord requirest thou from thy sons thou art merciful
thou hast raised up the holy prophet promised to the faithful for thirteen
centuries past lie hath appeared in the midst of the darkness his name
is the mahdi the sublime one

   a flattering murmur greeted these words

    i behold thee o mahdi on the field of battle thy march is swifter
than the flight of the falcon one town after another falls into thy hands 
the vanquished kiss thy sacred feet in vain for thou art implacable and doom-
est all to perish hicks pasha commanded the armies of the khedive and
led them against thee hearken children of the tribe of cherofa to what
allah the exterminator has done for you  he has sent the mahdi to
kashgil and all the unbelievers have perished  not one has returned of the
eleven thousand men 

    i the unworthy servant of the mahdi have summoned you to tell you
that the hour approaches but we must await the signal which cannot be
long in coming and above all brethren let us thank allah for his good-
ness  

   the arabs resumed the attitude of mussulman prayer and mabrouki
thought it a propitious moment to creep off he hastened to inform norbert
of what he had heard

   at first it seemed difficult to believe in the complete extermination of the
egyptian armp commanded by hicks pasha but it was a bad sign that it
should have given no evidence of life and have been utterly silent since the
departure for the south two months back

   soon it was no longer possible to doubt the truth of the catastrophe eye
witnesses testified to it the news was brought by camel drivers and mer-
chants from kordofan and  one doubted it at berber norbert himself
heard it from the lips of a workman recently employed in the wood yard
who had seen the plain of kashgil covered a month previously writli the de-
capitated corpses of the egyptian army the rifles guns and ammunition
were all in the possession of the mahdi

   norbert however would not despair he had so often in the past year
heard these sad forbodings  would he ever indeed have embarked on the
enterprise had he listened to what was told him at suakim 

   one morning wagner grypliins and vogel asked to have an interview
with him in the presence also of sir bucephalus

   wagner  entering held out a blue paper to norbert saying   this is
the news brought us from berber with the last load of goods  

   norbert read as follows

   the egyptian army carrying on operations to the south of suakim has
been completely routed at tokar by osman digma a lieutenant of the mahdi
the suakim-berber route is now in the possesion of the insurgents

    it is disastrous said norbert  but the nile route is still free

    yes answered wagner in a significant tone  and all who value their
lives had best follow that route at once  

   have you come to announce your approaching departure calmly re-
plied norbert


a month in the moon

    our own departure and yours also i presume said wagner for
surely you cannot now think of going  with the enterprise   

     why should you make such an assumption jjray  

    because if you do not at once give it up the workmen will stop it to-
morrow do you not know what is being said  all sides-in camp in the
tents and workshops that we are all to be massacred at a given signal

     if you think it right to go gentlemen cried norbert pray do so  i
cannot keep you by force and i should even make it my business to facilitate
your departure

      you know well enough that we cannot leave the interests of the company
in your hands   muttered wagner

     in that case gentlemen replied norbert coldly rising to intimate
that the interview was at an end  i can only trust that you may turn out
false prophets for my part i do not intend to move  

chapter xv-the negro guard

    the three commissioners retired crestfallen and norbert remained alone
with the baronet who was smiling

   what are you going to do asked the latter for you must own
there is some truth in their words

     what am i going to do i really do not quite know all that i can
say is that i am certainly not going to give up my enterprise to please either
of those gentlemen or the malidi   

   he began to walk up and down and touching a call bell summoned
virgil

     fetch mabrouki i want to speak to him

    the old guide soon made his appearance

    think you said his master  that it would be possible to pick out a
hundred honest fellows and form them into a trustworthy battalion of sharp-
shooters   

    mabrouki shook his gray head

    there is perhaps oneway of getting good soldiers said he after a
minutes deep reflection we might try to secure the late guard of zebehr
if the madhi has not already done so

       what are they   

     negroes from the great lake country whom zebehr the king of the
slave traders had armed and equipped for his own personal service on the
ruin of his trade the guard was disbanded and is now at large i have no
doubt that they would willingly take service  

     think you that these men would be faithful  

     i am certain of it they are splendid soldiers there is a whole vil-
lage of them at the oasis of gandara two days journey from here

     well mabrouki i give you full powers go at once and enroll a hun-
dred picked men on what you consider fair conditions and bring them to
me

     they shall be here in four days sir said mabrouki
a month in the moon



    the three commissioners also took counsel together

   you see it is impossible said costerus to come to terms with this
frenchman we must take strong measures

    how  

    i will manage it we are all agreed-are we not-upon one point-
that it is impossible to remain here  

     most decidedly

     it will never do to go and leave the frenchman master of the situation
neither can we very well carry him off bodily it would excite suspicion
were he quietly to disappear there is only one alternative-to drive him
away by instigating the workmen to revolt it would not be very difficult
judging from certain indications

     but would we not be the grst victims 

    no not if we are careful to let the arabs know that we sympathize
with them you are aware that i have been studying their language
for a year past  it is indeed my only amusement in this miserable
country

     yes yes

     well i vote that we don the arab dress and go among the men in the
evenings i will let them know that we have embraced their creed and that
we are with them in everything

     it seems a good idea and we may as well try it

      in less than eight days the workshops will be deserted we shall make
onr way to berber draw upan official report and return in triumph via the
nile first to london and then to melbourne should the frenchman refuse
to follow us the mahdi will soon rid us of him or else the shareholders will

i	will answer for it or my name is not costerus wagner  

      costerus you are a brick    exclaimed both his comrades as they
resumed their pipes

    four days went by without incident

   at length mabrouki returned with his habitual prudence he had
encamped his recruits three miles from tehbali wishing norbert to inspect
them before they were definitely engaged the astronomer and sir
bucephalus set off at once

   it was six oclock in the evening the negroes had just finished their
frugal repast of roasted maize and seated in a circle were singing to the
accompaniment of the tom-tom well grown athletic young men supple as
reeds and strong as lions they were evidently the very flower of the country
from which zebehr had torn them in their infancy the wore short
trousers of panther skin and camel skin helmets and were armed only with
a shield and a bundle of spears

    where is the chief  asked norbert as he came up to them mabrouki
having duly proclaimed his name and title

   a young negro more richly accoutered than the rest came forward

   i am chaka the black pasha of the great lakes he said with
dignity

    art thou and thy men disposed to enter my service  asked norbert
i

a month in the moon

     we are and you will find us good and faithful soldiers mabrouki has
fixed the terms you may rest assured that we shall do our duty

     the matter is arranged then mabrouki has spoken well

    chaka gave an order to his troop who came forward one by one and bowed
respectfully to their new master the young negro chief then took norbert
by the hand which was luckily gloved on account of the mosquitoes and
carrying it to his lips he spat upon it before any one guessed his intention

    norbert stood amazed but luckily the affectionate look the young chief
gave him reminded him that the performance was the height of courtesy and
he was therefore careful to return the politeness with usury this delighted
the negro and his troop who all shouted

     great chief  great chief  we will always remain with thee  always
always   

    cliaka and his men then shouldered their arms and baggage and followed
their master

   they proceeded toward the village as they approached it mabrouki
thought lie saw some commotion near the tent of aben-zegri and suspecting
a meeting like the previous one he had witnessed he proposed that norbert
should take a bypath and go behind the tents in order to find out what plot
wras being concocted the astronomer consented and calling a halt to his
negro guard he went on in front with sir bucephalus and mabrouki

    what was his surprise on drawing near the tent of aben-zegri to hear
a voice that he recognized as that of costerus wagner speaking arabic to a
numerous assembly he knew the language sufficiently himself to be able
to follow what wras being said peeping through a hole in the tent lie saw
that costerus was clothed in a wide burnouse and wore a turban and
gryphins and vogel similarly attired stood among the crowd of listeners

    men of little faith declaimed wagner is it thus you compromise
your eternal salvation you are working for an infidel and on the day of
judgment the prophet will drive you away from before his face know you
not the aim of him whom you serve  he desires to overturn the eternal
laws of nature allah suspended the crescent in the heavens as a sacred
symbol to his children the impious frenchman wishes to tear this sacred
sign out of the firmament and bring it to earth to be trodden under foot
norbert had heard enough hastening back to the spot where he had
left the negro guard  chaka said he to the chief  thou hast sworn to
be faithful to me now is the time to keep thy oath thou must accom-
pany me with thy men surround a tent and seize upon the persons whom i
will point out to thee

      when the master speaks chaka obeys   said the negro

    he made his troops take up their arms and march in two lines one in
front and the other behind the tent of eben-zegri

    the manceuver was successful ten minutes later wagner gryphins and
vogel were bodily carried off by six sturdy negroes and brought prisoners to
norbert the latter ordered them to be kept under arrest and closely
guarded until such time as he could decide concerning their fate and lay the
facts of their treason before the company
a month in the moon



   close by stood a glass foundry consisting of three spacious halls that
were of no further use since the vitrified sheet had spread to the bottom
this was to be their prison and virgil named commander in chief of the
negro guard placed sentinels at the door

   norbert was now at rest as to any possible - plotting at the foot of the
peak he had a sufficient force in hand to put dowrn revolt and the works
could proceed wdthout fear of interruption but a new anxiety arose
what would become of m kersain and to what perils would not gertrude
be exposed if the army of hicks pasha were in truth annihilated and the
mahdi marching on khartoum  these thoughts haunted him throughout
the busy day and disturbed his rest at night at last he came to a sudden
resolution

    sir bucephalus he said  could you replace me for a few days 

   sir bucephalus had no misgivings

    well i shall leave you here for a week in order to go and warn our
friends at khartoum

     very well was the reply

   and he started next morning

 chapter xvi-at khartoum

   at the ordinary rate of travel it would have taken four days to reach
khartoum from the peak of tehbali but norbert burning with impatience
got over the ground in forty eight hours on the second day after his de-
parture he saw in the distance the flat roofs and minarets of the  queen of
the soudan  rising amid palm groves from the level plain at the junction of
the blue and white niles

   during his rapid ride he noted many evident signs of panic and disturb-
ance parties of armed men came and went on both banks of the river
from all quarters troops of camels laden with grain tents and household
utensils passed along on their way to take refuge in the town they were
followed by women old men and children-all hollow eyed and melancholy
with wayworn feet bruised and bleeding

   as he drew nea rer to khartoum sadder and sadder grew the unmistakable
signs of the hurried flight of a whole people it was a regular rout of terror
striken victims all hastening to seek refuge behind the ramparts of
khartoum one and the same cry came from each group of emancipated suf-
ferers

     the mahdi  the mahdi is coming   

   the mahdi it is always the mahdi have you ever seen him
mabrouki asked norbert impatiently

    i knew his uncle very well he was a carpenter at chabakah opposite
sennaar and i recollect seeing the child there who was at that time appren-
ticed to his uncle answered the old negro  but i have only seen him
once since he became famous i do not think he is any better than others
his uncle could never make anything of him and i am convinced he does
not know how to read now any better than when he was at school but


a month in the moon

there never was his equal in reciting verses from the koran and performing
feats of strength and magic this was the secret of his great influence he
spent years in a cave dug by his own hands on the island of abba where he
passed the days and nights in fasting and prayer little by little he earned
a great reputation for sanctity and people came from all parts to consult him
bringing him rich gifts and offerings one fine day he styled himself a
prophet sent by allah to continue and complete the work of mahomet  

     then said norbert  you look upon him as a charlatan  

     i scarcely know what to call him he may possibly believe in his own
sanctity and divine mission there is moreover much truth in what he
says to incite the tribes against the foreigners every one  as had more than
enough of the turkish soldiers so it is not astonishing that the mahdi
should be listened to when he promises to drive them out of the country  

     consequently he has a chance of success 

     the greatest chance i should be surprised if he were not master of
the soudan within a month he has only to hasten to khartoum and the
thing is done

     but khartoum can defend itself   exclaimed norbert pointing to the
ramparts whose slopes were to be seen in the foreground  she has arms and
plenty of provisions and a large body of troops besides the european popula-
tion and all these refugees who do not seem to be very much attached to
the mahdi judging from their haste to fly from him

     khartoum might be defended answered the old guide shaking his head 

	 but the will to do it must be there and likewise some resolute man must
take tlie lead khartoum has neither the one nor the other 

    some minutes later norbert rode through the eastern gate and was struck
with the indolent downtrodden dirty aspect of the egyptian sentinels the
state of the town itself did not seem any more promising and it was difficult
to believe that the miserable suburbs and sordid streets could be part of so
rich and populous a city

    norbert repaired to the french consulate without delay leaving mabrouki
and his camel drivers on the parade ground m kersain was in his private
office with his daughter

   what a delightful surprise he exclaimed on seeing his young
friend

    you are just in the nick of time for we were dying of ennui said
gertrude

    norbert thought her more charming than ever but a little pale and worn
withal

     in that case he said pressing warmly the two hands held out to him
 i trust i shall have no trouble in persuadiug you i have come on purpose
to carry you both off with dr briet to tehbali or berber and thence to cairo
via the nile

    i could scarcely go to cairo at this crisis without special leave   replied
kersain  but perhaps we might go to tehbali my daughter and i are
tired of khartoum and what is going on here now is i assure you enough
to make the strongest man ill
a month in the moon



   the conversation then turned upon the works of tehbali and their pro-
gress since october when the dinner hour approached gertrude left them
alone with norbert m kersain poured out his whole fatherly heart keeping
back none of his terrible fears as to the near future

    my dear friend he said  i am in a most terrible position i could
not speak plainly before gertrude but i am firmly convinced that we are on
the brink of a great catastrophe not a single european will be permitted to
leave khartoum alive i could not as you know leave my post at such a
time but i would give anything in the world to know gertrude safe for it
is unbearable to think of her being exposed to the horrors of an arab inva-
sion besides these dangers there is the climate which contrary to my ex-
pectation does not agree with her  indeed she is fading away before my
eyes but how on the other hand can she go without me  it is quite use-
less to speak of it-she would never agree what can be done  i ought
not and i will not leave khartoum at this crisis what am i to do 

   you might come to tehbali with her ostensibly for a few days and
contrive to gain her consent to your return if you must come back here
leaving her under our care with the doctor and her little maid

    	yes said the consul it is a good idea worthy of your good heart 
but i would not leave khartoum now not even for a few days and if i
were willing to go would it be fitting to confide my daughter to the care of two
young men whom i sincerely esteem indeed but who are not in the slightest
degree related to her i fear it is not feasible alas  not even in the desert
do not misunderstand me though continued the consul noting the look of
deep disappointment on norberts countenance  if i had only to consider
in own feelings i would entrust her to you in the fullest confidence but
we have to think of the opinion of the world in these matters  

   consul said norbert with emotion these are exceptional circum-
stances would you intrust mile kersain to the care of her betrothed

     to her betrothed  replied the consul standing still in surprise  i
dont know yes of course i would  but what do you mean 

    do you think pursued norbert  that i could ever have a chance of
being accepted in that capacity by mile kersain and yourself   

     it is difficult to know what is passing in the heads of young girls said
her father smiling genially but as far as i am concerned i may at once
say my dear fellow that i should give my cordial consent to such a pro-
posal  

     i have no fortune said norbert   or at least the little that i possess
is staked in a very hazardous enterprise  

   it matters little my dear friend that is not the point you have a
name and a scientific position that quite counterbalance the slender dowry of
my daughter but i am quite ignorant of her own sentiments on the sub-
ject

     she does not like me   cried norbert discouraged already  i might
have seen it oh that i had been better able to express my sympathy and
my admiration   

     i have not said that you are displeasing to her interposed m kersain


a month in the moon

i was about to add that i make it a point of not influencing my daughters
choice and so my consent depends  hers there is nothing easier than
to find out the truth of the matter this very evening if you like to do so
 oh no not tonight pray   said norbert with a nervous precipitation
strangely at variance with his usual firmness   and  he resumed   you
will do me a favor by not speaking to her leave me this privilege

     very well it is scarcely in accordance with french usages  but i can-
not blame you since you have spoken to me first i will call gertrude down
or leave her with you when she returns to the room

   no please grant me a last favor said the young man in evident
trepidation   let me wait a little longer  

    wait i do not understand you now

     i will explain he resumed in a somewhat firmer tone  i am afraid
to risk what little chance i have by too great hurry let me have time to
prove my devotion if i were to speak now and meet with a refusal it would
be almost impossible to carry out our plans for her safety  

   but how do you mean to manage then said the consul on the
one hand you will be bound in honor by your words to me  on the other
hand my daughter would be free i do not call that just to yourself

   well what matter iam bound now for ever the chief point is
that you should make use of me to save her life and let me have time to
gain her love

    i see said the consul smiling that learning and romance are still
compatible well be it as you wish  i give my consent and i trust that
my daughter will know how to appreciate your chivalric devotion but our
difficulty is not solved how are we topersuade her to go without me 

     dr briet might help us by insisting  an immediate departure and a
prolonged absence from khartoum you might return if duty calls you
back

    suddenly a great noise arose in the street norbert and the consul were
hastening to the terrace to see what had happened when the door burst open
and fatima rushed in breathless and frantic exclaiming 

   general gordon  general gordon is coming the whole town are
gone to receive him  

     general gordon indeed  have you lost your senses   said the incred-
ulous consul

     the criers are calling it out and every one says it is true   affirmed
fatima

     impossible  general gordon without any army without giving any
notice of his approach it is impossible  

     look then  said fatima impatiently  see for yourself  

   they went on the terrace and gertrude came out almost at the same
moment crowds stood on the neighboring balconies at the windows and
 the door steps while in the street a great mass swayed to and fro as they
all pressed on in one direction

   suddenly a tremendous clamor was heard from the end of the street
paced slowly a solitary camel ridden by a blue eyed fair haired man of short
a month in the moon



statue wearing the uniform of a commander in chief every arm was
stretched out to him as he advanced every knee was bent before him and a
whole people shouted as with one voice

    hurrah for gordon  hurrah for our father the saviour of kordofau  

   the vision passed away in the evening the town was illuminated
general gordon held a reception of the consular body the authorities civil
and military and the chief inhabitants he expressed himself confident of
holding out against the mahdi announced that the town would be put into a
state of defense discipline restored and the moral tone of the troops raised
he had come he said to pacify the soudan in the name of the english gov-
ernment in a few days a british army would ascend the nile or else tak-
ing the insurgents-in the rear near suakim make a speedy end of them

   hope revived in every breast at these consoling assurances the consul
alone was not so easily convinced

    i was saying only today that a man was needed he remarked as he
rejoined norbert at the gate of the government house  the man is here
but i much fear that he is very insufficiently supported all will be well if
the english army he promises comes in time who knows whether it will
come at all  khartoum is a long way from cairo especially for an european
army well well we shall see

   at all events he resumed after an instants silence this sudden
transformation affords us a chance of persuading gertrude to go without me
eet us make hay then while the sun shines with the help of my brother in
law so saying he and norbert paid a visit to the doctor to invite him to
dinner

   and in the end everything was settled for their departure next evening
the day went by in preparations they started about seven oclock at
eight oclock kersain took leave of his beloved daughter and his friends

    i intrust them both to you  may we soon meet again he said to
norbert warmly shaking him by the hand  farewell doctor  farewell
in darling child   he pressed her to his heart an instant then shaking
his bridle he started off at a gallop anxious to hide his tears

    shall i ever see her again    passed through his mind as he rode back
to khartoum gertrude did not know why also she felt as if the separation
would break her heart norbert and the doctor tried hard to make her
smile but she was too unhappy to make any response to their affectionate
solicitude

   at midnight they encamped according to the usual custom under two
tents pitched by mabroukis arabs at the foot of a hill close to the track

   while they were breakfasting next morning previous to resuming the
journey a poor woman passed by driving an ass before her laden with figs

    will you buy some of my fruit   she asked

   they purchased a basketful and all ate some of the figs

   not three minutes later a deep slumber seized upon all alike fatima was
the first to succumb she fell sound asleep beside her mistress gertrude
did likewise followed by norbert and the doctor the arab camel drivers
also soon stretched themselves  the sand unable to keep their eyes open


a month in the moon

   mabrouki alone struggled long against a kind of stupor mingled with the
consciousness that that it was his duty to keep wide awake but at length he
too lay wrapped in a dreamless slumber

					ik	

   on first awaking gertrude thought she must be still in a dream she
opened her eyes in a large lofty circular hall lighted by seven copper lamps

   the walls were most artistically carved and decorated in a circle round
the hall stood basalt columns and statues of porphyry separated from each
other by mysterious looking alcoves which the imagination pictured as filled
with strange fantastic furniture she was the daughter of a distinguished
arch geologist and therefore knew at once that she was looking upon work
done in the greatest of the egyptian ages

   her interest in art got the better of her fear for a few minutes and she
walked around the hall to look at its decorations one would have said that
the sides of the alcoves between the columns and the colossal statues were
covered with gay colored draperies  but in reality they were adorned with
frescoes whose brilliant colors had lasted through thirty centuries

   the bed on which gertrude lay was of grotesque form and richly wrought
it represented an immense bronze tiger stretched full length his back
forming the couch it might have been made for some princess of ancient
thebes

   an ivory seat whose delicate carvings resembled the finest lace  a
silver table whose furbisliments were of yet greater value one of them being
a polished disk resting on the sculptured head of a kneeling slave  and a
magnificent lion skin covering the marble seats completed the furniture of
the alcove where gertrude had just returned to the consciousness of her sur-
roundings

    on the lion skin lay eatima still wrapped in deep sleep

   how had they come to this strange place  how long had they slept 
gertrude had no idea  and taking up her watch she found it had stopped

     fatima   she cried in sudden terror throwing herself off the bed

   the little maid opened her eyes she seemed dazed but rose to her feet
mechanically as it were

   nearly at the same moment a hidden door in the wall rolled aside noisily
and there appeared on the threshold a tall richly dressed negro

     the master   he said falling prostrate on his face

   behind him stood the dwarf of rhadatneh he wore a linen tunic white
as snow and in his crimson belt was his richly jeweled saber an aigrette
of horsehair surmounted his turban and from each hair depended a diamond
thus appareled the hideous black face and misshapen body looked more re-
pulsive than ever

   advancing with an assured air of self satisfied confidence in the effect
of his charms the monster came smiling to gertrude

    what do you want   she asked in a cold haughty tone

   lifting his hands the dwarf made her an obeisance in the arab fashion
without uttering a word then he knelt down and kissed the hem of her
robe regarding her at the same time with an air of supplicating humility
the black sheep of the post



   the tender hearted girl touched by his expression asked gently 

    what can i do for you  you seem to be appealing to my compassion
perhaps the mogaddem has been hard upon you if so come to khartoum
my father is powerful and respected he will know how to protect you

   the dwarf smiled disdainfully and rising stood before her his hands on
his hips and answered in a stentorian voice in french 

    i am not a slave  i need no ones protection and if i do homage it is
to beauty only what i offer thee young girl is to share with me the throne
of the soudan i am its king and i have chosen thee to be its queen

being the story of a crow indian and robinsons baby-what inspired devil jim to fight

his hardest in the face of fearful odds

t t k was big and red and lank awkward and uncouth a figure not pretty
to look at and somewhat terrifying to the mere superficial observer
some said he was a half breed but the crow was there predominant  the long
straight hair the rich coppery skin the small vicious eyes the falcate nose
the thin peaked jaw-all these were distinctive and no man with white
blood in his veins could have borne to be so uncleanly

   from the first day that he was attached to the little squad of scouts he
was looked upon with suspicion  he had no intimates no companions no one
into whose tolerant ear he might speak a word no one from whom he might
expect a sympathetic glance an outcast from his tribe he had not bettered
his condition his brother scouts hated him would have despised had they
dared  the enlisted men avoided him as if he were pestilent the officers
endeavored to ignore the fact that he infested the camp  whenever and wher-
ever the shadow of his angular figure fell every man in the neighborhood got
away with the least possible delay-no one felt easy in his company in a
word he was subject to all the aversion shown to a man that has the reputa-
tion of being ugly

   not however that he really was so they called him devil jim more
because he had simply the promise of growing up to the title than because he
had done anything to gain it while he was in the guardhouse most of the
time he was there for the reason that that was the most convenient place to
keep him-when lie wasnt there he was drunk he got drunk as often as
he could which was just as often as the other scouts and the enlisted men
did  but he seemed to have greater opportunity he was never at liberty
long enough to think of any overt act of lawlessness everybody said he
would if he got the chance  and that is why doubtless he was so promptly
clapped into jail notwithstanding the other view of prevalent ill feeling
toward him

   as time wore on and he was guilty of nothing for which a serious charge
could be brought against him and more than one regretted it every one was

greatly astonished his comrades said with evil grunts that the time would
come-sure  the officers were equally apprehensive if not so outspoken and
there was not one who did not secretly wish the bugbear removed thus it
was that devil jim got the name of being a terror without trying for it

   in the fall of the year young robinson came up from texas robinson
was a youngster only a year or so from the point  but he was already mar-
ried and he had got transferred from the fifth in texas to the second in
wyoming on account of tlie climate in the rio grande valley not agreeing
with his wife wlien he came to shoshone lie brought not only mrs
robinson but an infant of a year with its nurse and three or four pack-
loads of little tables with bamboo legs low spreading wicker chairs waste
paper baskets with blue ribbon run through the sticks and screens with
japanese storks woven in bullion there was also a resplendent baby car-
riage

    when pretty little mrs robinson delicate and liarebell-like first caught
sight of devil jin she was so terrified by his aspect that she tiembled at in-
tervals for days afterward it happened one afternoon when she was sitting
in her modest veranda and when jim was enjoying one of his rare holidays
out of the guardhouse he merely passed by he was not drunk for the
clerk at the post traders had just told him he would  talk to him on pay
day he did not even look at her but the apparition was so terrifying in
itself that little mrs robinson just sat and trembled it was awful she told
herself and she straightway wanted to tell some one else

   now there were but three other women at shoshone-her nurse the wife
of captain mcguire the commandant and the mcguires maid of all work
it was therefore to mrs mcguire that she went and after she had told her
story mrs mcguire who was anything but delicate and harebell-like laughed
quite heartily-heartlessly mrs robinson declared-and told her not to
mind a little thing like that because devil jims only prerogative in camp
was to encumber the earth and frighten people by appearing before them
whenever he had the good luck to get out of the guardhouse but mrs
robinson did mind very much and she doubted exceedingly if she could
stand it she appealed first to her husband

   edgar dear she said ive been so frightened today by an awful
looking wretch-an indian-who seems to have nothing to do but to wander
about dont you think you could get the captain to send him away  

    what awful looking wretch dearest  inquired young robinson sooth-
ingly

    why that-devil jim i think they call him

    urn whats he been doing dearest  

    doing  why cant he be sent away without doing something 

     im afraid not dearest

   mrs robinson inquired piteously of herself why she had ever married into
the army then she went to captain mcguire

    oh captain   she cried wrinkling her brows prettily  im in such
mortal terror of one of your scouts  and i want you to send him away
please  
the black sheep of the post



   the captain was noted for gallantry he was getting on in years he
bowed grotesquely and smiled  do you so much as point out the man my
dear lady and he shall be strung up by the thumbs he said

    oh i dont want him strung up by the thumbs  i only want you to
send him away-far away the very sight of him makes me shudder  
and she shuddered

   has he dared to annoy you mrs robinson this was serious he
looked askance

   why his very presence is an annoyance captain  he is a standing
menace to my peace of mind i dont want the man punished you know
captain-only removed 

    it shall be done replied the captain with a wave of his hand

   jim was shortly afterward summoned from the squad room to head-
quarters he had but recently served a term of three days in the guard-
house-on the old charge of drunkenness  he was now sent back for three
days- general principles as the captain succinctly remarked

   these three days were the exact period of the reign of peace restored 
within an hour of his liberation jim was again in trouble

   taking advantage of the fine sunshiny afternoons of the early autumn
mrs robinson used to send forth the baby in the resplendent perambulator
for some of the tonic air the nurse at first confined her strolls to the short
street within the stockade that ran before the quarters but she soon ventured
out upon the trail that led down the creek to the canyon now it so hap-
pened that when jim was released instead of going to the squad room to run
the fire of distrustful yet exulting glances which were his due from his com-
rades as he should have done he too made straight for this road-and it is
reasonable to suppose in the view of a crushed spirit wanting solitude
purely by accident

   he came upon the woman from behind when she heard the soft fall of
his moccasined feet she turned  and when she saw who it was she paled
her mistress had warned her devil jim not knowing what else to do
possibly ventured to smile propitiatingly and when he performed that for
him very unusual thing the girl let out a sky piercing shriek and made for
home with all possible haste-taking a wide course around him-abandoning
baby and perambulator to his mercy

   the rescuing party that set out upon her alarm was composed of young
robinson himself two brother lieutenants a scout and an orderly or two
the young mother would also have been with them doubtless but she was
in hysterics

   when after a hot run they came within sight of the perambulator they
saw something which at the very least they did not expect to see robinson
had been telling parker and bangs all along in a breathless despairing sort
of way that he knew just how it would be  the baby would be either
frightened to death poor little darling  or jim would have carried it off
his wife would never get over it he knew she would go insane or into a
decline or home to her mother-oh it was awful  the only coherency in
his remarks was wlia he vowed against the doer of the mischief  it was very

plain from the vvay he had been going on that jim was likely to have a very
unpleasant experience but instead of seeing all that bad been anticipated
there was nothing now but a view of devil jim kneeling beside the perambu-
lator ducking his ungainly head and laughing and acting altogether as if he
were harmlessly demented it was incredible yet they could make nothing
else of it

    this development however if it allayed young robinsons fears did not
appease his wrath thte abduction of the child would have been but a
degree worse than this intimate pleasantry that an outcast indian should
be playing with his child  it was too much and when the fact became
evident that the baby was crowing in appreciative glee the last straw was
added

    devil jim had his back turned when they approached at the distance of
fifty yards or so young robinson stopped his companions and went on
noiselessly alone as he got close he heard the indian chanting a queer little
native song accompanying it with grimaces the babys eyes were big
and when his entertainers head ducked-a part of the play which took place
every few seconds-his gurgles of pleasure burst forth the father saw noth-
ing to laugh at he was upon them in a moment and he seized the crow
by the shoulders and sent him sprawling

   jim looked up from where he had been thrown he did not seem to be
angry but surprised and hurt when young robinson with a forbearance
for which he congratulated himself afterward turned him over to the orderlies
without chastisement jim seemed to take it as a matter of course that he
should be tied at the wrists and held out his hands robinson gathered the
infant to his breast it caused him a pang to discover that the child was not
ecstatic at its deliverance it began to whimper with arms outstretched
toward the miserable object now standing complaisant between the two
orderlies

    jim got another little term for this escapade but it was only for a fort-
night and when it was over and he wras out again mrs robinson was beside
herself to learn that he could not be detained permanently in the guardhouse
without some specific charge it was a pretty note she declared she
wished they had stayed in texas

   the nurse was instructed to remain within the stockade thenceforth
never upon any account to venture outside but even with this restriction
there seemed to be no way of avoiding devil jim from afar he would gaze
at the baby in the perambulator and successful in attracting its attention
would perform some rediculous antics for its amusement indubitably the
first white baby he had ever seen it had for him some subtle fascination  he
had found something more worthy his worship than the black bottle at the
post traders

    with a view to enhancing his attractiveness in infantile eyes he got to
picking up stray articles of vivid coloring for his adornment  a bandanna
neckerchief came first then a peaked baseball cap of red and white stripes
next a belt which was only half a belt the front being a sash but the
crowning acquisition was a small round pocket looking glass with a place in
the black sheep of the post



the rim for pins this he wore on the left breast of his blouse where the
enlisted men wore their marksman badges

   as all these things cost money and as jim got very little of that there
was nothing left for liquor  so he came to be out of the guardhouse nearly
all the time and he grew-through inward grace as well as outward care-
to be less forbidding in aspect with these changes mrs robinson was
beginning to think his presence in camp more endurable but at the very
moment when he bid fair to become a respectable member of society he was
guilty of his most flagrant misdeed

   the nurse who was a more or less comely young woman with a certainty
of the more in her own mind was impressed with the manly bearing of a
corporal who looked after her with very close attention when she was out
upon parade not unnaturally these two meeting so often in the course of
time struck up a little flirtation  and soon the corporal made it his business
to await the maid at a point out of sight of quarters where he would join her
upon her stroll wi th the baby jim noticed how things were going-possibly
surmised that the infant was not getting much attention now-and before
long he too would follow at a respectful distance

   and thus one day when the two lovers were so busily engrossed with
each other that they had eyes for nothing else jim stole up from behind
doubtless with the intention of having some play with the baby while in
the act of passing his big paw over the infants flaxen curls he was surprised
by its custodian vlio promptly delivered herself of a scream which awoke the
echoes and caused the robust swain at her side to jump in alarm soldier as he
was

   what jim was doing with the babys hair never transpired  the girl
when questioned afterward declared that she had seen a knife gleam in the
indians hand and that she was positive he intended to scalp it but as the
corporal could not corroborate her much as he desired to and as no knife was
found upon jim when he was searched captain mcguire credited the story
to imagination all he could do with jim was to put him into the guard-
house again

   mrs robinson believed the girls story implicitly  more she believed
that devil jim had had designs upon the babys life ever since it had come to
camp possibly she had ground for this suspicion  if she had it was cer-
tainly strengthened when a few days after the latest outrage the baby
became ill

   those were troublous days from the commandant down to the lowliest
scout every man in camp was impressed into the little sufferers service
-every man except devil jim who was in the guardhouse mrs robinson
her husband mrs mcguire and the surgeon rarely left the bedside so
engrossing was tlie one misfortune that discipline was relaxed and no one
was required to do more than think of and for the baby there was a week
of it  and then at dawn of a cool october morning the child died

   little mrs robinson collapsed she was unable to attend the simple
funeral and slue was not alone in her grief when the procession moved
up the little hill to the burial plot the men who looked the grimmest were not


the black sheep of the post

the least affected  there was not a dry eye or perhaps save one-devil
jim looking out from behind the bars of the guardhouse had eyes that were
merely vacant

    it was a good thing for young robinson that late the same evening there
came from department headquarters a telegram ordering the troop into the
field there had been a descent of sioux marauders upon the ranches in the
northeastern corner of the territory  they had stampeded ponies and cattle
and were carrying things with a high hand  the department commander de-
sired to suppress the band while yet there was fine weather the orders
were for immediate action therefore the troop was got into marching order
by lantern light

    as it was essential that every available man be in line devil jim was let
out at once he was morose and dejected  and the mood was more noticeable
in the prevalent high spirits that had been quickly called forth by the
promise of an exciting campaign he was ordered to take his place in the
detachment getting ready the pack train

   it was not long however before he succeeded in stealing away in the
darkness after stopping a moment in the uproarious squad room he slunk
along in the deepest shadows until he was clear of quarters  then he made
off at a quick run in the direction the little funeral had taken that afternoon
it was but fifty rods or so to the spot he sought  and even in the darkness he
had no difficult in finding the diminutive mound of newly turned earth

   he sat down beside it puffing  and when he had regained breath he
crooned the little native song young robinson had heard beside the peram-
bulator it was not long  and having finished he gravely went to the foot
of the mound and began to pluck at the long grass then with great care
he drew something from the pocket of his blouse it was the peaked cap
with the red and white stripes from the same pocket came the bandanna
and the belt that was half a sash these he tied into a small compact
bundle and scooping out some earth with his bony fingers placed in the
hole covering them with the grass for the head of the grave the resplend-
ent pocket mirror was reserved then he chanted another verse of the song
stood a little while in silence afterward and finally backed away toward
quarters

   the column was on the march by dawn first were the scouts a dozen or
so jim among them  then the troopers captain mcguire and young robinson
at the head  last the stringing pack train their course lay along the trail to
the eastward  and many miles were between them and their destination
into the bright rays of the morning sun they cast expectant eyes for action
was before them but two seemed to have thoughts other than for what was
to come young robinson rode with head bowed in grief devil jim in a
stupor

    forty miles was the distance that day  and at nightfall the bivouac was
in a deep gully the bed of which was dry about the camp fires there was
gaiety  for the yesterday was no longer remembered in the new excitement
young robinson left his companions at the earliest opportunity and climbed
the steep sides of the ravine to the prairie above there beneath the vault
the black sheep of the post



in which sliqiie stars like baby suns his hot head cooled by the breezes that
set the grass to murmuring he walked until long after midnight he thought
he felt that he was alone  and ill the darkness he was

   but devil jim his lank figure indistinguishable was never far from him
he whispered softly to himself-even the whispers seemed guttural  he
wanted to speak  but his english was not good he never got further than
the whispering

   the morrows sun rose red and burning quickly the troop got under
way again moving still to the eastward the scouts were some miles in ad-
vance now thrown out as a skirmish line it was thought that by noon
there would certainly be some sign of the marauding band and it was not
long before the watchful eye of the commandant detected the presence of
hostile indians in the action of these scouts ahead they were galloping in
to a center from their outposts

   one presently came at a wild pace to the rear he reined up before
captain mcguire and spoke a few words quickly then commands were
given and a trumpet rang out there was a hasty dismounting a tightening
of girths then tins trumpet again sounding to saddle an interval of speak-
ing silence ensued

   suddenly another blast sent the whole column forward at a quick trot
the sleek flanks of horses and the glittering accouterments shone out from
the cloud of dust there was  sound save the thunder of hoofs and the
clashing of scabbards but when they got up to the front the low chant of the
crow death song came back on the breeze from the line of scouts

   down through a ravine the advance was made slowly and then there was
a creek to be forded the opposite bank was fringed with cottonwoods and
nothing could be seen yet but upon emerging from the underbrush a long
stretch of bottom laud lay away to the south and in the distance was an
indian encampme nt it was not merely a depredatory party it appeared for
there were tepees and women and children

   the troop was halted a moment for formation then deployed on the bot-
tom it moved forward at a double quick the camp was taken by surprise
with cheers and yells the line swept on

   presently there was a sharp volley from the carbines then an answering
volley the line wavered closed up and pressed on another volley met
with a desultory fire only and the charge was made at the gallop in a
moment the outskirts of the camp were reached and the engagement began
hand to hand the sharp snapping of revolvers the occasional clashing of
sabers the same wild yelling filled the air as the line fought its way in
among the tepees

   all at once there was a cracking of rifles from the underbrush  the
flank horses fell with their riders and  there was a moment of confusion
the line was doubled upon itself to meet the new attack in the dust and
smoke it seemed to have lost formation and to be slowly falling back

   the scouts were fighting in advance of the troopers and they were first
to recoil disputing inch by inch one moment they would give way the next
rally with renewed yelling they were but a handful and the raking fire


small services

from the underbrush was dropping them one after another at last the few
remaining were forced back with a rush

   but one did not for the moment yield true to his name he had fought
like a devil in the first impact of the attack he had rushed forward and
entered the indian village for a while he had been lost in the clouds of dust
but when his companions fell back he was seen some distance behind them
also retreating but with his face to a party of hostile indians four or five
whom he held in check with a revolver under his left arm he carried a
bulky bundle

   for a moment he was seen thus to stand at bay but a rifle rang out in
that moment he jumped suddenly into the air his ungainly body all angu-
lar and then dropped doubled up in the deep dust

   young robinson flushed firm lipped sweating in little rivulets stood in
the van of the troopers swinging his glinting saber to right and to left he
too had been unhorsed but he hardly noticed it the commandant had fal-
len and he was trying to rally the broken line his example inspired courage
and confidence and soon he had gathered about him all that were left
seizing a riderless horse he mounted and again commanded a charge

   the remnant of the little troop spurred forward a few rods away and
directly in their path devil jim lay on his side holding aloft an indian pap-
poose bundled in skins with what breath was left him he yelled  more
baby -more baby   and tried to attract young robinsons attention with
frantic gestures but  one seemed to see him and the line galloped 

   for a while the charge seemed hopeless but so fierce and stubborn was
it that a hostile band twice as large would have found it difficult to withstand
it brought demoralization disintegration and panic and in a few minutes
the indians were in retreat

   but half the troop returned to shoshone the others found a resting place
in the bottom it was generally conceded that young robinson wras the hero
of the fight and that it was due to him alone that any of them were left to
return

   the little party detailed toward dusk to look after the fallen and to per-
form for them the last rites could never afterward agree among themselves
as to how the pappoose came to be lying beside devil jim nor could they
guess hard as they tried where he had got the little yellow curl they found
in a leather pouch hanging to a piece of string about his neck

   not that it mattered however

 the mutiny on the flying cloud

thrilling experiences among the islands of the western pacific-the hostage chosen by the
pirates to coerce the first mate-what befell when the malays attacked
the stockade on refuge island

synopsis op chapters previously published

    the clipper ship flying cloud captain blake commanding is en route between new york
and australia with seven passengers dr henderson his wife little child lucy and his wifes
sister sibyl stanley also mr grant a civil engineer with his wife and seven year old son percy
after crossing the line the chief mate bryce is lost overboard and ned wilson scarcely twenty
is advanced to the post while robert manners who is no older is made second officer mean-
time josh williams one of the able seamen foments discontent among the crew and one night
captain blake and mariners are seized bound and placed in captivity while williams makes
clear to ned wilson that the price of the safety of the women and children among the
passengers is his promise to faithfully navigate the ship to the best of his ability for the muti-
neers

    williams proposes to put the passengers ashore on one island and the two ships officers on
another but several days elapse before land that seems suitable is sighted finally one about
six miles long is selected and the passengers are sent off in two boats at the last moment sibyl
stanley is detained from accompanying her friends williams arguing that she must be held to
insure neds trustworthiness captain blake and manners are landed on another island and
soon afterwards the flying cloud is put in at a third one having a safe harbor between tall cliffs
screening her from all observation the crew go off on exploring trips and ned takes sibyl
stanley in the dingey he shoots a gay plumaged bird which in falling becomes fast in the
bushes fifty feet up a cliff leaving sibyl in the boat ned starts to clamber up after it and
presently vanishes from view beneath the greenery after waiting a long while and becoming
anxious sibyl calls to him but receives no reply a minute or two later she calls again but still
no answer	

chapter xiv-a strange discovery

then sibyls repeated calls brought no reply and ned wilson did
not reappear on the steep cliff above the boat the young girl became
seriously alarmed dosing command of herself she called upon her com-
panion in piteous accents to answer or if anything had befallen him to give
her some sign of his whereabouts in order that she might be guided to his
assistance

   still calling him she was about to attempt the perilous ascent of the cliff
in quest of ned when she heard him shout and looking up saw him leaning
over the edge of a rocky ledge about a hundred feet above her

   are you all right miss sibyl he shouted i thought i heard
you call

   yes she replied steadying her voice as well as she could on the in-
stant i am all right thank you but you were so long away that i began
to fear some accident had befallen you

the mutiny on the flying cloud

   no he answered back i am all right but i have made a most
wonderful and interesting discovery that-however i will come down

    and suiting the action to the word he at once began to descend the cliff
not vertically as he had gone up but in a diagonal direction and as sibyl
thought at breakneck speed ned continued in his wild career until he
reached the waters edge at a distance of perhaps two hundred feet to the
westward of the boat when from what sibyl could see of his movements
he appeared to break the bough of a bush in such a manner as to leave the
branch dangling from the parent shrub after which he began to make his
way along the cliff toward the boat

    a few minutes later he reached the dingey-minus the bird by the by
which he had set out to secure-and stepping in at once proceeded to cast
off the painter then as he stepped aft and tossed the paddles into the row-
locks he first got a glimpse of sibyls still troubled face

     i beg your pardon miss sibyl he said  i am afraid i have fright-
ened you by my long stay aloft there the fact is i was so interested in my
discovery that for the moment i forgot the flight of time

   i have made a most curious discovery i had not made my way very
far up the cliff when i came to what looked so very much like a flight of
roughly hewn steps that i determined to follow the indications and investi-
gate i did so and soon came to the conclusion that though the step like
projections were just as thickly overgrown as the rest of the cliff showing
that they had not been used for years or possibly generations they had un-
doubtedly been wrought out by the hand of man

     pushing the shrubs on one side i had no difficulty whatever in making
my way upward until i at length came out upon a flat platform of rock in
the outer edge of which were two holes or depressions some twelve feet
apart which i imagined might have been hollowed out to receive the heels
of a pair of sheers an impression which was rendered all the stronger when
on looking more closely i discovered a groove terminating in a third hole
which i immediately guessed must have been formed to receive the heel of
the back leg you will perhaps comprehend me when i explain that sheers
are used to assist in hoisting heavy articles the rocky platform is about
fifteen feet square the cliff overhanging it above  and at its back part there
is a sort of split in the rock about eight feet wide and nearly the same in
height i passed in through this crevice and at once found myself in a cave
perhaps thirty feet wide and about fifty feet deep

      and now comes the strangest part of the affair it is nearly half full
of bales and parcels with several jars apparently earthenware their mouths
tied over with what looks like a coarse kind of cloth and in one corner
there are stacked up a number of weapons-spears and axes-so rusted and
decayed that they may have been there for centuries there are also a
number of what i took to be shields by the look of them  but they like
everything else are so coated with dust that i did not touch them but i
must certainly give the place a thorough overhaul as it may serve us as a
refuge and place of concealment at a pinch would you like to go up and
have a look at the cave and its contents now 
the mutiny on the flying cloud



   i should like it very much if you think i could climb the stairs
answered sibyl

   oh res answered ned-   you can do that easily enough i should
think  and i should like you to make the attempt if only to find out
whether you could accomplish the ascent at some future time if necessary
i will go before and clear the way for you using the axe if we meet with
any very serious obstacles  but i think you will be able to manage without
much difficulty ah here you see is the landing at the bottom of the
flight and ned indicated to his companion a flat ledge about a yard square
close to the surface of the water

   the dingey was carefully secured and then stepping on to the ledge
ned assisted the young girl ashore

   there could be  doubt as to the fact that from this ledge or landing a
flight of step like projections led diagonally up the face of the cliff  and
thickly overgrown as they were there could be as little doubt that if not
entirely artificial nature had been largely assisted by the hand of man in
their formation

   the flight averaged pretty evenly about a yard in width each step being
about six inches high so that but for the dense growth of shrubs upon
them the ascent would have been exceedingly easy even as things were
sibyl experienced far less difficulty than she had anticipated ned going
before and then pressing the shrubs aside to facilitate her passage using his
axe here and there to remove such growth as stood fairly in the middle of the
way

   nor was the ascent nearly so dangerous as might have been expected the
dense growth all along the outer edge of the stairway forming a sort of bul-
wark which rendered a fall almost impossible so safe indeed and compar-
atively easy was the ascent that it was accomplished in about twenty minutes
when after poiutiug out the holes in the upper platform and fully explaining
the structure and uses of the sheers which he believed to have once stood
there ned led the way into the cave

   for a few minutes after entering everything was so dark compared with
the brilliant daylight without that nothing could be seen at length how-
ever their ejres became accustomed to the soft twilight gloom of the place
when ned at once began to direct sibyls attention to the various articles that
were stored there

   the first objects examined were the weapons all of which were stacked in
one corner the shields-for such they actually proved to be-were circular
about two feet in diameter and made of a metal which when cleaned of its
thick coating of grime and a small portion of its surface scraped with a knife
turned out to be brass on the inside two leather straps were riveted one
for the arm to pass through and the other for the hand to grasp but so old
and decayed were these straps that the crumbled into black dust at a touch

   this was also the case with the wooden shafts of the spears which pow-
dered away like touchwood and as for the spear heads and the blades of
the axes they were so rust eaten that little more than a rough jagged indica-
tion of their original shape remained


the mutiny on the flying cloud

   the earthen jars of which there were twenty four next claimed neds
attention these vessels stood about two feet high and were about ten inches
in diameter of peculiar though not ungraceful shape and they were singu-
larly heavy as ned discovered when he seized one with the intention of
moving it forward into a lighter part of the cave

   the mouth was covered with four thicknesses of a kind of cloth such as
ned had never seen before the cloth being bound round the neck of the jar
with several turns of fine cord which like the cloth seemed to have been
treated with a waxy coating

    if preservation was the purpose of the treatment it had succeeded fairly
well  but the outer or top layer of the cloth covering the mouth of the jar
had rotted and split here and there the second layer however was in a
very fair state of preservation and the other two layers were perfect

    neds knife quickly severed the cord which however was so rotten that
it came to pieces during the process of unwinding and he then uncovered the
mouth of the jar and peered down into it

the vessel was full of a coarse dull yellow glistening sand a handful of
which the young fellow quickly removed and carried out into the daylight
ned was back in a moment exclaiming to sibyl in a tone of astonishment 
 it is gold dust miss sibd  gold dust and thousands of dollars worth
of it  

  - i am very glad to hear it answered sibyl  but are you quite sure
you are not mistaken  how do you know it is gold dust   

    i know by the look and weight of it answered ned i have seen
too much gold dust in australia to be deceived in such a matter look at it
and feel it for yourself-note the weight of a handful of it and you will be
satisfied that i am right i expect the contents of all these jars are the same
but i will open one or twto more j ust to satisfy myself  

   he did so and found his conjecture to be correct-the three which he
opened were all full of gold dust like the first

    quite a large pile of small brick like parcels next came in for a share of
neds attention they were enveloped in waxed cloth and like the jars were
singularly heavy

   ned opened one and on removing the cloth wrapper disclosed to view a
block of dull yellow virgin gold the block was about the same shape as
but a little larger than an ordinary brick and stamped or molded on each
side was a sign or symbol of hieroglyphic characters

   ned did not consider it necessary to open any more of the brick like
parcels as after his experience with the jars he felt fairly satisfied that if
opened each parcel would be found to contain a gold brick similar to the one
already disclosed he was therefore about to suggest a descent to the boat
under the impression that his inspection of the cave and its contents had
been completed when his attention was attracted by an extra large brick like
parcel which he thought he might as well examine he accordingly raised
it from the floor to carry it further forward into the light when though
tolerably heavy the comparative ease with which he lifted it at once assured
him that whatever else it might be it certainly was not gold
the mutiny on the flying cloud



   the grimy cloth wrapping was soon removed and a casket of discolored
brass of elaborate and curious workmanship was disclosed the lid was not
secured in any way otherwise than by the hinges and so perfect had been
the protection afforded by the waxed cloth wrapping that these worked with-
out difficulty

   the lid was quickly raised and the casket-which measured about fifteen
inches long by nine inches wide and perhaps ten inches deep-was found to
contain a number of neat parcels the first which came to hand was at once
opened and there before the eyes of the admiring pair fresh as if just removed
from the shell lay some two hundred or more magnificent pearls

   sibyls admiration of the pearls plunged her into a perfect trance of de-
light the other parcels were found to contain rubies sapphires emeralds
diamonds and other precious stones all in their rough state just as they had
been unearthed from the mine but all of extraordinary size

   at first the fortunate finders were not greatty impressed at the sight of
these stones for neither of them quite knew what they were-though they
judged them to be valuable from the circumstance that they had been deemed
worthy of a place in the same receptacle with the pearls-and it was only the
gleam of the diamonds which at last awakened in their minds a suspicion that
the stones were really precious

   when at length however this suspicion dawned upon them ned posi-
tively gasped for breath

    why he exclaimed  we are rich  rich beyond the power of compu-
tation there must be at least a hundred magnificent fortunes in this cave
and now all that we have to do is to give those ruffians the slip when i will find
means to return here and recover all this treasure now he went on  ill
tell you what we will do we will divide the contents of this box into two
about equal portions one of which we will convey from time to time  board
the ship whilst the other shall remain here  and in this way i think we may
make reasonably sure of securing one half of the gems whatever happens
the gold we must leave i think as too cumbersome to be dealt with under
our present circumstances now slip those pearls into your pocket and i
will take as many of the diamonds and what not as i can sow away after
which i think we had better see about getting back to the ship

   but interposed sibyl have we any right to touch these things
surely they must belong to some one

    i have not the slightest idea who was the former rightful owner of all
this property replied ned laughing  but whoever he was he has been
lust and ashes long ago and so too have the rovers who i expect brought
them to this out of the way place and hid them in this cave of one thing
you may rest assured and that is that we as the finders have a better right
to everything in this cave than anyone now living

   the reasonableness of this argument satisfied even sibyls sensitive con-
science and she made no further demur to neds proposed arrangements

   an hour and a half later they reached the ship just as the sun was set-
ting and found her still deserted though the men could be seen mustering
 the beaches and preparing to return  board advantage was taken of


the mutiny on the flying cloud

this circumstance by sibyl to stow away in her own trunk at neds request
all the jewels brought on board thus leaving that young gentleman free to
meet w illiams on his return to the ship and to make such a report of his
explorations as he might deem fit

   half an hour later all the men had returned on board and though the
were tired by their unwonted exercise they had evidently enjoyed the day
just as much as though they had been so many schoolboys

   on the following morning work was begun in earnest part of the men
being engaged in unbending sails and sending down the upper spars whilst a
contingent under w illiams landed and proceeded to cut down trees for the
purpose of building stores a dwelling house a kitchen and so on on shore

   williams plans comprised no less than the entire stripping of the ship
down to the deck  the thorough overhauling of her hull inside and out
including cleaning and scrubbing and a number of petty alterations in her
rigging which he thought would have the effect of disguising the vessel
and in addition to this he also proposed to construct on shore permanent
buildings for the storage of his booty as well as for the residence of a small
contingent of men to guard it

   this of course was not only a work of considerable time but it also in-
volved the complete evacuation of the ship a circumstance which ned foresaw
would cause very serious inconvenience to sibyl this however was at
length surmounted by his obtaining the very reluctant consent of williams
to employ some of the men in the construction of a hut for her sole accom-
modation he at the same time locating himself iti a small tent which was
pitched close at hand so that he might always be able to watch over her
safety

   meanwhile the southern cross duly arrived at melbourne after an ex-
cellent passage  and captain spence was intensely gratified when he found
that nothing had been heard of the flying cloud

   a week later the southern cross was lying with an empty hold waiting
for her homeward cargo to come alongside and still theflying cloud had
not put in an appearance knowing what he did of the latter vessels sail-
ing powers captain spence could only conclude that after the flying cloud
had parted company with him in the atlantic she must have met with a
streak of foul wind or light airs which his own ship had happily avoided 
but when a week later still the flying cloud had not arrived the exulta-
tion which the skipper had at first experienced was converted into a feeling
of anxiety which increased as time went on without any appearance of his
rival

   the southern cross cargo was slow in coming alongside  but never-
theless wrhen she was loaded and her hatches put on and she finally went to
sea on her homeward voyage the flying cloud was still numbered among
the non arrivals and when after a long passage home the southern cross
arrived in new york and captain spence had time to inquire after his old
friend blake he was not only surprised but deeply grieved to hear that no
intelligence of his arrival in melbourne had up to that date been received

but there were others even more interested than captain spence in the
the mutiny on the flying cloud



fate of the flying cloud and these were by this time anxiously watching the
shipping news in the daily papers for tidings of the ship they came at last
in the shape of the following paragraph 

missing vessel

   the following vessel previously referred to as overdue was 
wednesday posted as missing 

    the ship flying cloud blake master which left new york for
melbourne on september 

chapter xv-exploring refuge island

   it is now time o return to the little party of passengers who it will be
remembered were left in a situation which was certainly the reverse of
pleasant

   mr grant whose profession peculiar adapted him to cope with such
difficulties as those which now environed the party at once naturally took the
lead and assumed the direction of affairs-a position which dr henderson
most willingly accorded him counting himself indeed fortunate in being thus
associated with a man of such resource as the engineer

   in their present state the first thing to be done was to provide a shelter
for the helpless women and children of the party  and no sooner was the
boats cargo discharged upon the beach and conveyed in safety above high
water mark than was this task commenced

   a suitable position for the tent which grant proposed to put up was
soon found among the trees which grew thickly in clumps on the gentle
slopes just beyond the sandy beach two cocoanut trees growing at a con-
venient distance apart were selected as uprights  and a young sapling was
then cut dowm and lashed horizontally from trunk to trunk at a height of
about nine feet from the ground to serve as a ridge pole

   the sail was next hauled over this sapling and secured to the ground on
each side in such a form as to make an a-shaped tent about twelve feet long
by eight feet wide the spare canvas being so split that it fell down at the rear
and front end of the tent in such a way as to enable the little shelter to be com-
pletely closed when necessary and this done the bedding as well as such
articles as it was important to protect from the weather were at once placed
under shelter and the interior of the tent made as comfortable as circum-
stances would permit  thus completing the first portion of their task

   the next thing was to construct a shelter for the powder-and in fact
their little all in the shape of worldly possessions which they thought it un-
desirable to put into the tent

   two more cocoanut trees were selected  another stout sapling was cut and
secured between them as in the case of the tent though not quite so high
from the ground and then a quantity of other and somewhat lighter saplings
were procured to form a roof which by sunset next day they had succeeded
in covering with a good serviceable thatch quite impenetrable to the weather

   before this was accomplished they were unexpectedly reinforced by the


the mutiny on the flying cloud

sudden appearance of nicholls whose presence upon the island up to that
moment had been quite unsuspected by them the fugitive had been so
anxious to avoid all possibility of recapture by williams men that he spent
the night in the woods presenting himself to the little party as they sat at
breakfast the next morning

   his sudden appearance created quite a sensation for the moment but he
was almost instantly recognized

    why nicholls   exclaimed grant what is the meaning of this
what are you doing here  i thought you and the rest of the mutineers were
far enough away by this time  

    well sir said nicholls twisting his cap nervously in his hands as he
spoke i hope the rest of the mutineers are as you say far enough away
by this time but i am here and here i intends to remain-with our good
leave sir the fact is mr grant ive cut and run  that fellow williams-
as perhaps you may know sir-is a rare good un to talk and he managed to
talk me as well as the rest of the hands quite into the idee that pirating was
just the best thing a poor down trodden seaman could turn his hand to but
after i agreed to jine them i began to think matters over a bit and the more
i thought about it the less i liked it and at last i made up my mind that
id slip my mooring aboard the cloud the first chance i got so i managed
to get told off for service jesterday in one of the boats and watching my
chance i sort of strolled up among the trees and then took to my heels quite
determined not to show up again until the clouds togantls had sunk below
the horizon and now here i am sir ready and willing to ship with you
i may be able to make myself useful enough to earn my bread and cheese
well nicholls said mr grant  i am heartily glad to see you my
man and as to your earning your bread and cheese a stout handy fellow
like you will be a considerable acquisition to us in our present circumstances
we shall doubtless have to endure much hardship and be exposed to count-
less perils but whatever may fall to our lot i feel confident that in the end
you will be better off with us than you would have been with williams and
his piratical crew but sit down man  sit down and take some breakfast
you must be nearly famished by this time if as i suppose you have eaten
nothing since you left the ship yesterday  

   nicholls nothing loath at once seated himself and was served with
breakfast which he devoured with an eagerness that at least spoke well for
the tonic properties of the air he had lately been breathing

   i should like said mr grant  before we go any further to say a
word or two whilst we are all present here upon our future plans i do not
know how it may be with you henderson  but delightful as is the climate
of this island and fertile as its soil appears to be i have no fancy for adopt-
ing it as my permanent home i am anxious to return to civilization at as
early a date as possible what are your ideas upon the subject 

    precisely similar to your own   answered the doctor

    very well said grant  then i will now tell you in as few words as
possible what my ideas are upon the subject when we were in the act of
leaving the ship yesterday that noble fellow ned slipped into my hand a
the mutiny on the flying cloud



strip of paper in which he had noted not only the position of this island but
also the important fact that he had detected the presence of what he believed
to be a wreck on the reef  the western side of the island the position of
the island as given by ned places us at no very great distance from land 
but that land is inhabited by people who would not scruple for an instant to
cut our throats if they thought it would suit their purpose to do so  it is
useless therefore for us to think of making for a nearer port than either
hong-koug or singapore or one of the ports of western australia our
island is unfortunately for us situated in a sea which is swept at times by
the most destructive hurricanes  and it would be madness for us to think of
leaving this place in anything but a craft capable of living through the very
worst of weather i have not the slightest doubt of my ability to design
such a vessel  but let her be as small as we dare to make her her
construction will be a work of great difficulty and wrill take a long time

    during that time we must all be housed and clothed and fed and i
therefore propose that our first task shall be a thorough examination of the
entire island for the purpose of ascertaining the most suitable spot as a base
for our operations  and that discovered i think we should next go to work
to construct for ourselves such a dwelling as shall bid defiance to an assault
by anything but civilized troops  stock it abundantly with provisions so that
if besieged we may not have famine to contend with  and that done i think
we shall then be free to begin our operations upon the boat

   the doctor if left to himself would scarcely have known what to set
about first and he was therefore only too glad to find that grant was not only
so willing but also so thoroughly able to grapple with the difficulty he
said as much  and when nicholls was asked his opinion it turned out that he
was quite unable to advance one but was perfectly willing to follow the lead
of his superiors let them go where they would

   the next matter for consideration was that of the exploration of the
island which grant proposed to undertake alone his idea was to advance
cautiously inland for a mile or so and then if he saw no sign of their terri-
tory being inhabited to make a push for the mountain at about the center of
the island and from thence onward to its western side

   he thought it only prudent to start upon this expedition thoroughly well
armed and in addition to his repeating rifle and the revolvers and hunting
knife which he wore in his belt he carried an ax which he thought might be
useful in a variety of wajs he hoped to return to camp that evening but
foreseeing that he might meet with delays  the way he cautioned them not
to feel in the least anxious on his account should he be absent that night and
for the matter of that the whole of the next day

   on taking leave of his companions he at once struck inland towards the
mountain which looming vast and gray formed the most prominent object
and landmark in the entire island the ground sloped gently upward and
was thickly covered with long tangled and luxuriant grass and at a short dis-
tance from the beach it began to be thickly dotted with clumps of trees
among which the cocoanut the date palm and two or three varieties of the
banana seemed to be the most prominent
io	the mutiny on the flying cloud

    advancing steadily and with tolerable rapidity over the gently rising
ground he at length when not more than about two miles from camp sud-
denly found himself upon the verge of a ravine with steeply sloping sides
through the bottom of which wound what he at first took to be a river but
which on close examination he found was really an arm or estuary of the
sea

    descending the banks of the ravine he followed this stream-which at the
point where he encountered it was about a quarter of a mile in width-and
after pursuing a somewhat devious route for about another mile and a half came
to a spot where this arm of the sea widened out to a broad expanse of water
nearly circular in shape and rather more than a mile in diameter indeed it
had at this point very much the appearance of a lake

    almost in the very center of this lake stood a small island of about eight
or ten acres in extent and thickly wooded which the engineer at once fixed
upon as a most suitable spot on which to establish an encampment as this
would be a desirable location for many reasons

    grant was very anxious to reach this island and submit it to a closer ex-
amination but he had no means of crossing the intervening water except by
swimming and this in consequence of the distance to be traversed would
occupy more time than he felt justified just then in devoting to it but he
promised himself that circumstances permitting he would do so on his
return journey

chapter xvi-the wreck on the reef

    so far grant had met with no trace or sign of the existence of savages
or indeed of inhabitants of any description upon his territorj  and he there-
fore relaxed somewhat of the vigilant and anxious demeanor which he had
hitherto observed and pushed forward with as much rapidity as circum-
stances would allow upon his journey

    traversing the borders of the lake which lay embosomed in the midst of
steep hills he reached after a walk of about a mile a spot where a genuine
stream flowed into it

    at the point of junction with the lake this stream was about a hundred
yards in width having a current which flowed seaward at the rate of half a
knot per hour half a mile further on following the course of the stream
grant found that the channel narrowed very considerably aud whilst still
to all appearance moderately deep the current became much more rapid

   it was at about this spot that he discovered what he thought would
serve as a capital site for a mill if indeed the little party should find it in
their power to undertake so important a work  and making a mental note of
the locality he passed on

    he now determined to follow the stream to its source as his active mind
already began to see that it might prove a very useful ally to them in many
was on the way he frequently encountered brooks of more or less im-
portance flowing down into the main stream on either side of the ravine
but they wrere scarcely sufficient in volume to account for the large quantity
the mutiny on tfhe flying cloud



of water which now went clashing and foaming and sparkling over a bed of
huge bowlders

   at length he came to the end of the ravine and there he beheld a sight
which amply rewarded him for all the labor which he had undergone in fol-
lowing the stream

   the ravine terminated in a wall of rock fully a thousand feet in height
from an immense fissure in which near the top there spouted a column of
water which he estimated to be at least twelve feet in diameter for fully
a third of the distance this liquid column poured down unbroken to be dashed
into spray and mist-in which a rainbow softly beamed-upon an immense
spike of rock which divided the flow into two nearly equal parts and formed
two superb cascades one on each side of the projecting rock

   by making a detour grant was able to climb to the high ground above the
ravine and thence to the summit of the mountain he had now spread around
and beneath him a prospect of such surpassing beauty as he thought he had
never gazed upon before the sea bounded his horizon  every side whilst
the entire island lay spread out like a map beneath him  and with the aid of
his telescope he was even able to discern the gleaming white canvas of the
tent which marked the position of the little party he had left behind

   when he turned his face to the westward he saw that the remarkable cliff
which ned had noticed as the ship passed the island and which seemed to
divide it into two separate and distinct portions was distant not more than
three quarters of a mile from the base of the hill on which he stood

   the top edge of this cliff bounded his view to the westward so far as
the island was concerned  but the bay with its encircling reef was visible
and even with the naked eye he readily detected on the interior edge of the
reef a small speck like object which the telescope showed him to be the
wreck mentioned by ned in his note

   the day was now wearing on apace and his long walk had sharpened his
appetite  grant therefore thought that he could not do better than sit down
where he was and take his luncheon

   his meal over the solitary explorer descended the mountain and made his
way to the edge of the cliff arrived there it soon became apparent that
the most difficult portion of his journey still lay before him for at the point
where he then stood he saw at once that to descend the cliffs face to the
slope below would be an impossibility without the aid of ropes or some sub-
stitute for them

   he turned south and followed the edge of the cliff hoping to find a spot
at which he might descend but without success as he at length reached a
point where the face of the cliff turned sharply off to the eastward eventually
running sheer down to the water

   retracing his steps grant soon found himself back at the spot where he
had in the first instance reached the edge of the cliff and passing on he
found at a distance of about a quarter of a mile beyond a narrow chasm or
gap which on careful inspection he saw would enable him to descend to the
sloping greensward at the foot of the cliff

   down this gap he cautiously scrambled narrowly escaping an awkward
ioo

the mutiny on the flying cloud

fall once or twice on his way and by that means soon reached the foot of the
cliff which appeared to maintain a tolerably uniform height of about three
hundred and fifty feet

   from the point where he now stood the ground sloped pretty evenly down
to the water the inclination of the slope being about one foot in every three
and the distance to the waters edge a mile as near as might be

   the base of this long slope terminated in a long strip of sandy beach
which was strewed here and there with timber from the wreck in the offing
this wreck mr grant was exceedingly anxious to visit as he felt it might-
and probably would-prove of inestimable value to himself aud his compan-
ions later on

   it was not more than half a mile distant from the beach and was lying
close to the inside fringe of the white water which broke over the outlying
reef she was a large vessel measuring as near as grant could judge some
sixteen hundred tons and she appeared to be built of wood all three of her
masts were over the f ide and could he seen floating there still attached to the
hull by the rigging

   her bulwarks were entirely swept away as also were her deck houses-
the broken stanchions of which grant thought he could detect still projecting
above the surface of the deck the stem aud stern posts of a couple of her
boats still dangled from her davits which seemed to point to the conclusion
that when disaster overtook her the crew had been allowed little or no time
in which to provide for their safetj

   grant was an excellent swimmer and having no boat he thought his
quickest mode of reaching the vessel would be by taking to the water he
was ou the point of stripping for this purpose when his eye still fixed upon
the ship he caught a glimpse of two or three small dark objects projecting
above the surface of the water and moving slowly about

   he had a very shrewd suspicion as to the nature of these objects and his
telescope soon demonstrated to him the fact that he wras right in believing
them to be the dorsal fins of so many sharks

chapter xvii-exploring the wreck

   the sight of the sharks effectually put an end to grants project of
swimming off to the wreck aud he at once began to look about him for the
means of forming such a raft as would enable him to make the trip in safety
there was plenty of timber lying strewed about the beach but he had no
nails or tools of any description except his axe with which to construct the
raft under these circumstances the matter required a little thinking out 
and whilst deliberating upon the best mode of proceeding he sauntered along
the beach on the lookout for suitable materials

   he had been walking slowly along for a distance of about a mile when his
quick eye detected certain objects lying on the sand which he instinctively
divined to be human corpses and making his way to them lie found he was
not mistaken there they lay-seven of them-just as they had been washed
ashore dead after their last ineffectual struggle with the merciless sea
the mutiny on the flying cloud		

three of them were fully clothed  the remaining four were clad only in
their shirts which seemed to indicate that they had leaped from their ham-
mocks upon some sudden alarm and rushed upon the deck to be almost im-
mediately swept overboard

   it was difficult to judge accurately how long a period had elapsed since
death had overtaken these unfortunates  but from their appearance grant
believed that it could not have been many weeks it was a sad sight to look
upon especially for a man in his situation  and he hastened to remove it by
roughly sharpening a fragment of plank with his axe and scooping shallow
graves in the sand into which he rolled the bodies and hastily covered them

   this shocking discovery diverted his thoughts for a short time from his
original project  but having done all he could for the poor wretches he was
glad to turn anew to the question of the raft to a man accustomed as he
was to the quick devising of expedients it was not difficult to scheme out the
plan of such a structure as would serve his purpose

   looking about him and collecting a quantity of such small pieces of
wreckage as had nails in them he formed them into a heap to which with
the aid of some dry grass and withered leaves and a lens from his telescope
he set fire and left it to consume then picking out three six inch planks of
about equal length he sharpened their ends with his axe and laid them on
the beach at a distance of about three feet apart with their sharpened ends
pointing seaward

   he next procured three pieces of plank long enough to just cross the first
three planks at right angles and as soon as his bonfire had burned itself out
he cleared the nails from among the ashes and with them fastened his struc-
ture together two short pieces of plank nailed vertically in midships with
another piece secured on top of that formed a rough and ready seat  and
two other pieces secured crosswise on each side of the outer edges of his
raft and at the distance of about a foot abaft the seat gave him a fairly ser-
viceable substitute for rowlocks he had already been fortunate enough to
find a couple of small oars and he now thought he might venture to essay a
trip to the wreck

    small as was his raft it was still so heavy as to give him some trouble in
the launching of it but he at length got it fairly afloat and seating himself
in the center adjusted his oars and began to try its paces he was greatly
surprised to find that he could propel it through the water at a very fair
speed and without much effort and this fact ascertained he at once headed
straight for the wreck which he safely reached in about half an hour

   there were plenty of ropes ends dangling from the ships side to one of
which he made fast his raft and laying the oars carefully down in such a
manner as that they would not be likely to slip overboard he scrambled 
board the wreck and reached the steeply inclined deck

   the vessel appeared to be fully as large as he had supposed  and he was
agreeably surprised to find on investigation that she had not received nearly
so much damage as he had anticipated indeed her injuries seemed to be con-
fined almost entirely to the loss of her masts bulwarks and deck houses
the cabin had been on deck  but this was swtept away


the mutiny on the flying cloud

   the forecastle however was below and into this he descended it wyas
arranged in the usual manner on board merchant ships-that is to say it had
standing bunks round each side of it in which the bedding of the unfor-
tunate seamen still remained precisely as when the ship struck

   the seamens chests were also there showing that the had had no time
to make any elaborate preparations for leaving the ship  and the impression
produced upon grants mind by what he saw was that when the ship struck
the watch below must have rushed at once up on deck and very soon if not
immediately afterward have been swept overboard

   as he was there not to satisfy his curiosity but to ascertain of what
value the ship might prove to himself and his friends he did not hesitate to
open and examine the chests of the poor fellows  but he found nothing
therein except such coarse clothing as is usually worn by merchant seamen
and a few little odds and ends of  particular value except perhaps a sail-
ors palm or two with sail needles  and in one or two instances a little house-
wife with sewing needles thread etc neatly arranged

   one of the chests however proved to be a carpenters tool chest  and
this although grant had a small one of his own among his effects would be
of such priceless value to the little band that he determined to secure it then
and there  and he accordingly dragged it on deck at once in readiness to
transfer it to his raft

   the floor of the forecastle was quite dry and this circumstance led grant
to hope that the hull had received no damage  but on raising the hatch lead-
ing to the fore peak he saw that the place was nearly full of water his ex-
ploration of the forecastle ended here  and he was about to proceed on deck
when he caught sight of a fishing line suspended on a nail inside one of the
bunks

   this fishing line he at once secured and took on deck with him laying it
down on top of the carpenters tool chest so that it might not be forgotten
when he left the wreck

   he now proceeded to the after end of the ship here the cabins had
been entirely swept away and he had no means of ascertaining any particu-
lars as to the ownership of the vessel the nature of her cargo or her destina-
tion-the ships papers and the captains private documents having doubtless
gone overboard with the wreck of the cabin but by looking over the ships
counter he saw that she was named the mermaid and that she hailed from
the port of bristol england

   that portion of the deck which formed the floor of the cabin had been
covered with oilcloth  and this oilcloth still remained in place securely
nailed dowui to the planking looking about him grant had no difficulty in
discovering the locality of the hatch leading down to the lazarette which
like the rest of the cabin flooring was covered with oilcloth on folding back
which he noticed with satisfaction that the sea had been prevented from
penetrating into the interior

   raising the hatch he descended and found as he had expected that the
place was well packed with the usual stores supplied to such a ship when
bound upon a long voyage he opened a few of the cases at liap-liazard and
the mutiny on the flying cloud



extracted from one a bottle of port wine and from another a tin of preserved
soup  he also found several casks of ships bread from one of which he filled
his pockets with this booty he returned to the deck and deposited it on the
tool chest

   he next turned his attention to the hatches these were all securely
battened down  and he noticed with great satisfaction that the tarpaulins
which covered them were quite uninjured and to all appearance perfectly
watertight he was about to break open the main hatchway but on further
consideration he decided not to do so until he was prepared to hoist out the
cargo and transfer it to the shore as he well knew that when the tarpaulin
was removed he would be unable to properly secure it in its place again with-
out assistance

   his preliminary examination of the wreck was now completed and the
position of the sun warned him that it was high time for him to set about
returning to the shore he met with a great deal of trouble in lowering the
heavy tool chest down the ships side and safely depositing it on his flimsy
raft  but so much value did he attach to its possession that he determined
not to leave the wreck without it and he eventually succeeded though not
until the sun was within half an hour of setting

   this task successfully accomplished and the fishing line bread wine and
tin of soup placed in security on the top of the chest he cast off and cau-
tiously pulled away to the shore which he safely reached just as the suns
upper rim was disappearing below the horizon

   he was by this time desperately hungry and the first thing to which he
devoted himself was the preparation of supper his first idea was that he
would be obliged to consume the soup cold  but the prospect of such a com-
fortless meal was so little to his taste that he began to look about for some
means of overcoming this disadvantage

   what he wanted was a vessel or receptacle of some description in which
he could heat the soup and make it somewhat more palatable  and here he
remembered having passed during his mornings ramble on the beach a very
large shell of the species tridacna gigas he bethought himself of its
whereabouts while busily engaged in moving the tool chest etc well up
above high water mark  and having brought the locality to mind he took the
tin of soup in his hand and hastened along the beach

   the shell was not very far distant and securing it he dragged it to a con-
venient position and imbedded it in the soft dry sand placing the tin of soup
in it he next collected a quantity of dry twigs and brushwood of which
there was no lack beneath the trees at a short distance from the beach he
also gathered a quantity of dry leaves and with these and the brushwood he
built the constituents of a fire which he next lit with the aid of a match a
few of which he had taken the precaution to provide himself with that
morning before setting out

   his next task was to find a few large pebbles of which there was a plentiful
supply lying aboitt just where the sand and soil proper met selecting about
two dozen of the largest he conveyed them to his fire and carefully arranged
them in the midst he then proceeded to fill the shell-which was to serve as


the mutiny on the flying cloud

his cooking pot-with salt water  fresh water being at hand  after which
he sat down and waited patiently until the stones which he had laid in the
fire should be sufficiently heated for his purpose

    about twenty minutes sufficed for this when the hot stones were dropped
 one after the other into the shell by which means the water was very
 soon brought to the boiling point and maintained at that temperature long
 enough to thoroughly warm the soup the tin of which he had after some
 difficulty succeeded in opening with an axe he then hurried back to where
 he had left the wine and the bread both of which he conveyed to his ex-
 temporized kitchen and there with the aid of a small shell carefully washed
 made shift to consume the soup washing it and the bread down with a mod-
 erate draught of wine

    this done he knelt down on the sand and commending himself aud his
 dear ones to the care of his maker stretched himself out by the side of the
  fire and was soon wrapped in a dreamless sleep which lasted until morning

chapter xviii-the islet in the lake

    grant was awakened by a sound so homely and familiar to his ears that
 when he first started up he almost believed that the experieuces of the past
 few months could have been nothing more than an unusually vivid and cir-
 cumstantial dream and that he should find himself a tenant of some pleasant
 american farm house

    i he sound-which was the crowing of a cock-was repeated and answered
 from the woods at a distance of perhaps half a mile and again answered by
 another shrill crowing nearer at hand but in a different direction

    he was astounded what could be the meaning of the presence of do-
 mestic fowls  this lonely island  he started to his feet and set off deter-
 mined to investigate

    the crowing was repeated often enough to serve him as an effective guide
 in his search and proceeding cautiously he at length found himself quite
 close to the spot from whence the sounds apparently proceeded

    still advancing cautiously he presently heard not only the crowing of a
 cock but the loud triumphant clucking with which a hen proclaims to the
 admiring world the fact that she has laid an egg a little further away he
 heard in addition to these sounds the softer cluck with which a parent lien
 calls to her chickens and presently peering out from behind the bole of an
 enormous teak tree he saw not only chanticleer but also his harem con-
 sisting of half a dozen hens two of which had broods of fluffy looking
 chickens running at their heels

    this was a most delightful surprise to graut for though the island
 seemed to promise that he and his party would never be likely to want for the
 means of sustaining life here was a supply of food which carefully looked
 after would be the means of affording them manj a dainty dish

    the fresh morning air had again sharpened the solitary mans appetite
 which now admonished him that it was high time to think seriously about
 breakfast aud the loud continued clucking of the hen which had laid an egg
the mutiny on the flying cloud



 reminded him that fresh eggs were very good for the first meal of the day
 his first intention was to confiscate that egg but a moments reflection
 showed him that if left alone it might eventually become a chicken and thus
 considerably increase in value he therefore decided to forego the gratifica-
 tion of fresh eggs for breakfast and to turn his thoughts in some other
 direction

   it occurred to him that fresh eggs being in the existing state of the mar-
ket too expensive a luxury for breakfast fresh fish might serve as a very
satisfactory substitute he therefore made his way to the beach and taking
his fishing line launched the raft and went off as far as the inner edge of the
reef wondering meanwhile how the presence of these domestic fowls could be
accounted for upon the island

   if the mermaid had not obviously been wrecked too recently to admit of
the existence of so flourishing a brood he would have thought that they
must have formed part of the livestock of that vessel and that when she
struck and her decks were swept the coops had been smashed and the fowls
had succeeded in effecting their escape to the shore this however was
impossible on the face of it and he knew not how otherwise to account for it
unless the- had been lauded and left by some passing ship which seemed
even more improbable

   he was not long in reaching the inner edge of the reef where he laid on
his oars baited his hook with one of a few shell fish with which he had pro-
vided himself and dropped the line into the water where it had not been
above half a minute when he felt a tremendous tug pulling up the line
quickly he found that he had captured a magnificent nine pounder in splen-
did condition being very like a salmon in shape make and color excepting
that it had a larger sharper head and a finer tail

   securing his prize he at once put about and made for the shore as he was
anxious to reach the camp on the other side of the island that evening

   having caught the fish the next question was how it could be cooked
he had been revolving this matter in his mind on the return journey from the
reef and remembered having somewhere read of a process which he thought
would suit his present condition

   he recollected having noticed an outcrop of clay not far from where he
had camped on the previous evening and making his way to the spot he
secured a- sufficient quantity to serve his purpose the next thing he re-
quired was a quantity of leaves and he plunged into the woods to search for
some which might be suitable

   he found plenty but they were all of a class unknown to him and as
they would come into intimate contact with his food in the process of cooking
he hesitated about making use of them  so pushing  a little further he
was fortunate enough to discover an orange tree laden with both blossoms and
fruit in every stage from the little hard green ball the size of a marble up
to the perfect fruit just changing from the dark olive green to a golden
yellow the leaves of this tree would suit his purpose admirably  so gather-
ing as many as he required as well as three or four of the finest specimens of
the ripened fruit he returned to the beach
io

the mutiny on the flying cloud

   here he at once proceeded to mould a portion of the clay into a rough sem -
blance of a long narrow dish of dimensions suitable for the reception of the
fish this clay dish he thickly lined with orange leaves upon which he laid
his fish entire as it had come out of the water covering it with another thick
layer of orange leaves and then with a thick coating of clay so that the
completed structure resembled a roughly modeled clay pie with the fish
wrapped in orange leaves in its center

   he now proceeded to light a fire and when the brushwood of which it
was composed had been reduced to a mass of glowing red hot embers his clay
pie was carefully deposited in the center fresh brushwood was heaped
thickly on the top and then he sat down to await results

   in about half an hour the clay showed signs of cracking which told him
that his culinary operations were complete  so dragging the mass out from
under the embers he proceeded to carefully break away the top layer of clay
and there lay his fish cooked to perfection a dish fit for a king

   upon this fish and a portion of the bread which he had secured from the
wreck  the previous evening he breakfasted royally washing down the
whole with a moderate libation of wine and topping off with a couple of
oranges after which he was ready to start  his homeward journey before
going however he hauled up his raft as high as he could get it on the beach
placed the two oars in safety beside the carpenters chest and roughly
thatched over the latter with palm leaves to protect it from the weather

   the long pull of a mile up the steep slope leading to the base of the cliff
tested his unaccustomed energies very severely and the toilsome scramble
up through the precipitous incline of the gap taxed them still more  so that
when he at length reached the top of the cliff he was glad enough to fling
himself dowm in the long grass and allow himself half an hours rest

   at the end of that time he once more set forward shaping his course so
as to pass to the southward of the mountain and from thence down the steep
ravine to the edge of the river the left bank of which he determined on this
occasion to follow

   after a fatiguing but nevertheless enjoyable tramp he arrived at about
two oclock in the afternoon at the margin of the lake and at once took
measures for swimming across to the islet in the center collecting a large
bundle of rushes he stripped and placing his clothes and his other belongings
upon the flimsy raft thus formed and stepping into the cool refreshing
water struck quickly out into the lake pushing his raft before him

   as he approached the islet he noted with great satisfaction that so far as
he could then see the place was admirably adapted for the headquarters of
the little partj so long as it might be necessary for them to remain in their
island prison there were trees in abundance and of many varieties but
they did not grow so thickly together as they did on what we may call the
mainland large spaces of open prairie being discernible here and there which
grant already mentally devoted to the process of cultivation

   swimming quietly he reached the islet with very little fatigue and
dressing himself at once set about looking for the wherewithal for a dinner

   he had not far to go for he had scarcely plunged into the first grove of
the mutiny on the flying cloud



trees wlien a large bird took wing from among tlie branches aud raising his
rifle he succeeded in bringing it to the ground it proved to be a brush
turkey which he forthwith proceeded to pluck aud prepare for the spit 
lighting a fire meanwhile so that it might burn well up and be in a fit state
for cooking when wanted

   the turkey was cooked-after a fasliiou-and if it was not as well done
as the engineer could have wished it was still sufficiently so to satisfy his
hunger after which he set out to explore the islet

   it was of no very great size being about ten acres in extent or there-
abouts but its surface was finely broken up into miniature hills and dales in
such a way as to not only make the spot appear larger than it really was but
also to present a very pleasing variety of aspect to the eye he found here
a spring of fresh clear cool water which was a source of great satisfaction
to him as the wrater of the lake being in direct communication with the sea
was somewhat brackish too much so at all events to render it a desirable
liquid for drinking and culinary purposes  and the presence of this spring
would avert all necessity for a search on the mainland

   having an eye to the presence of the children upon this islet grant was
peculiarly inquisitive in the matter of reptiles aud it was a great relief to his
mind to discover that if any such were about they were so scarce that during
his entire search round and through it he did not encounter a single snake
so far as he could see there were no animals to be found though birds were
of course in as great variety and numbers as they were  the mainland of
the island

   he was fortunate enough to find not very far from the spot on which he
had landed a shelving piece of beach running down into deep water which
would serve him admirably as a site on which to build his proposed boat and
near it distant in fact not more than two hundred yards-there was a small
grove of palms aud other trees which would serve admirably as a shelter from
the sun for his proposed house

   his survey of the islet completed he again entered the water and with
his raft of rushes ahead of him as before quietly paddled across to the shore
on the right bank of the stream which he now proposed to follow down to its
j unction with the sea a walk of about six miles brought him to the mouth
of the little estuary which he found perfectly concealed from the ocean in
consequence of the river taking a sudden bend and then doubling again
almost upon itself between two low bluffs which rose steeply out of the sea

   at this point there was  beach whatever the shore being rocky and pre-
cipitous  but somewhat further on the slopes of the land became gentle and
a sandy beach was met with which after a walk of some seven or eight
miles brought him out at the spot on which he had originally been landed
from the ship and within full sight of his companions

chapter xix-the pontoon raft

   grants arrival which took place just as tea wras being served in the
camp was greeted with great rejoicing by all hands but especially by
ios

the mutiny on the flying cloud

mrs grant who notwithstanding the assurances of dr henderson was
beginning to feel serious alarm on account of her husbands prolonged
absence

   of course there was much to tell on both sides the principal item of
news from the doctor was that he and nicholls had between them contrived
during the two days of grants absence to erect a very roomy and by 
means uncomfortable shelter for the men of the party in addition to which
the whole of their goods and chattels were now placed in perfect safety so far
as the weather was concerned

   no adventures of any description had been met with by any of the part-
a circumstance which was no doubt largely due to the especial care which dr
henderson had exercised in keeping them all close to the shore from a sus-
picion he had entertained that the forest depths might not be altogether safe
traveling at least for women and children

   grants story of his journey to the wreck with the vivid description he
gave of the fertility and general productiveness of their island home greatly
raised the spirits of the listeners and the sanguine way in which he spoke of
their ability to build the little vessel caused them already to feel as if their
days  the island were numbered

   the chief point calling for consideration was how they should dispose of
themselves in the immediate future their position was this they were then
located on the eastern end of the island the lake and the islet were situated
almost iu the center of their domain or say at a point about six miles distant
as the crow flies from the point where they then were whilst the spot where
the wreck lay if measured in the same way would be about live miles
further on

   grant made it so clear to them that the islet was the most fit and proper
spot at which to establish their headquarters that that matter might be con-
sidered as already definitely settled but the would have to draw all or
nearly all the materials for the proposed craft from the wreck  and that
wreck would not only have to be broken up but the timber etc would have
to be conveyed to the islet before a permanent settlement could be established
there

   had the party consisted of men only there was  doubt their best plan
would have been to remove in a body to the western end of the island and to
have established themselves temporarily  or near the beach close to the
wreck whilst it was being broken up  but it seemed to be rather a hardship
that the women and children should have to be removed there-involving a
somewhat lengthy and arduous journey-and to go into temporary quarters
only to have to return again over a great deal of the same ground after-
wards

   grants idea was that the ladies and children might be safely placed on
the islet and comfortably housed there in the first place  after which the
three men of the party could go over to the wreck and remain there until
everything of value was got out of her he undertaking to visit the islet at
least once every day to ascertain that all was going well iu that direction

   this proposition however met with no favor from the parties chiefly
the mutiny on the flying cloud



interested  and so it was ultimately resolved that notwithstanding the incon-
venience the entire party should settle down for the time being on the
western side of the island

   on the following morning this resolution was put into effect the little
band taking with them nothing but just such arms as were deemed absolutely
essential to their safety and the tinware knives and forks and other small
table conveniences with which neds forethought had supplied them

   on this occasion grant who of course acted as guide struck off in a new
direction  as having made a sketch plan of the island when he was  the
summit of the mountain he believed it possible to reach the wreck by a much
shorter route than the one he had followed keeping somewhat more to the
right or in a more northerly direction than on the first occasion he brought
his companions out upon the banks of the stream at a distance of about two
miles below the lake where the channel was somewhat wider than in any
other portion of its course and where the current was particularly gentle

   here it became necessary to construct a raft of some description for the
transport of the party across the stream  but as the water was perfectly
smooth anything which would bear their weight and hold together during
the passage was considered sufficient and wdth the aid of their axes such an
affair was knocked together in about three hours the transit was then
safely accomplished  and climbing the steep slope of the ravine through
which the stream flowed they found upon reaching its summit that they had
arrived at a spot overlooking the lake and from which they were enabled to
obtain an excellent view both of it and the islet which occupied its center
the ladies were especially delighted at the prospect of finding a home ill so
lovely a spot  whilst henderson cordially agreed with grant that it would be
difficult to find a safer place and one more suitable in every respect for head-
quarters

   pushing  they arrived about three oclock in the afternoon at the base
of the mountain  and here in a pretty little meadow which lay between
two of its projecting spurs they determined to encamp for the night the
children although they had been carried for the greater part of the day
being extremely tired and the ladies scarcely less so

   a little hut of branches and palm leaves was constructed as a shelter for
the weaker members of the party during the night the men contenting them-
selves with the soft luxuriant grass for their sleeping place  and then
whilst nicholls set to work to build a fire grant and henderson went off in
different directions to forage for a supper

   the night passed without adventure or alarm of any description although
as a measure of precaution the men had deemed it advisable that each should
watch for an equal portion of the time  and  the following morning after
an early breakfast the march was resumed the gap in the cliffs was
reached about two oclock that afternoon  and by three the travelers found
themselves on the beach at its nearest point to the wreck

   the first matter to be attended to now was the erection of shelters of
some description henderson undertook to cut down a couple of saplings
which grant pointed out as suitable for the purpose  and whilst he was


the mutiny on the flying cloud

engaged upon this task the engineer accompanied by nicholls went off to
the wreck their object being to procure not only a small quantity of ships
stores but also one of the sails which they intended to utilize in the con-
struction of tents

   on arriving alongside and making a minute inspection of the wreckage it
was found that the raffle was so complicated that to cut away the sail from its
yard as it then lay aud to convey it to the shore would be a work of very
great difficulty  so after a short consultation together grant and nicholls
decided to cut the whole adrift from the wreck and then warp it ashore just
as it was

   nicholls accordingly set to work upon this task with his axe  and whilst
he was thus engaged grant searched for and found the boatswains locker
rummaging in which he discovered a small grapnel just suited to his purpose
this he convered on deck and unreaving as much of the running gear as he
could get at a good long warp was made by bending the whole together end
to eild

   by the time that his preparations were completed nicholls had got the
wreckage cut completely adrift from the hull and the tw o men now pro-
ceeded to carefully coil down upon grants raft the whole of the warp  the
grapnel being bent to one end whilst nicholls who was going to remain on
the wfeckage retained possession of the other

   grant then pulled shoreward  and as soon as the full length of the warp
was paid out he dropped the grapnel overboard and then made the best of his
way back to the wreckage which nicholls had already begun to drag shore-
ward by the warp

   the progress of the wreckage shoreward was very slow but it improved
somewhat when grant was able to rejoin his companion as the warp was
hauled in it was carefully coiled down on the wreckage  and when at last the
grapnel came to the surface it and the warp were once more promptly trans-
ferred to the raft and a fresh cast was made by which means they managed
in about an hour aud a half to get the spars with all attached so close to the
beach that they grounded

   it was now a comparatively easy matter to cut it apart and so obtain the
sail which was the first thing they required the forecourse was selected
as being of considerable dimensions  and this when detached from its yard
was dragged up on the beach and spread out to dry

   with this sail and rope procured from among the rigging which had come
ashore attached to the spars they were able to construct two capital tents 
and by nightfall the party found themselves snugly housed

   the two succeeding days were devoted to the construction of a shed of
dimensions sufficient to contain all that they thought would be likely to prove
valuable to them among the stores and the cargo of the ship the structure
was twenty four feet long by eighteen feet wide and eight feet high to the
eaves and it had a regular pitched roof with gable ends so that when the
rainy season came-as come grant felt certain it would-the wet might be
thrown off leaving the goods beneath its shelter undamaged

   the shed completed their next task was to secure everything which might
the mutiny on the flying cloud



prove of any possible value to them from the cargo of the wreck in order
to transfer these articles from the hulk to the shore a raft would be neces-
sary and a raft would also be required to eventually convey those goods
round to the islet

   the latter transfer would involve the expenditure of an immense amount
of labor and time unless the wind or some other motive power could be
pressed into their service and grant had already learned during the course of
his professional experience that when any important work had to be performed
it was better and more economical in every way to provide efficient  plant 
in the first instance

   now the construction of the vessel which he had in contemplation was a
simple and easy enough matter to a shipwright with all the usual appliances
at his disposal but was really an important and formidable task to a people
situated as these were and therefore when talking the matter over together
they had influenced by grants arguments resolved to devote the time and
labor required to construct such aids as he seemed to think would be necessary
and desirable

   to convey from where they then were round to the islet all that they
would require for the construction of their vessel would with an ordinary
raft propelled by oars alone involve a vast amount of labor and time and it
was ultimately dee ded that it would be more expeditious in the long run if a
raft could be constructed of such a character that she could be moved in any
required direction by sails

    after a little thinking grant came to the conclusion that it would be pos-
sible to construct such a raft and he set to work to plan it the structure as
decided upon by him consisted of two flat bottomed straight sided pontoons
each twenty four feet long by six feet wide and six feet deep their ends
being curved up from the bottom until they met the deck in a sharp chisel
like form

    these pontoons were built with their fore and aft centerlines parallel and
were constructed on separate pairs of ways the whole of the materials being
obtained from the wreckage already strewn along the beach and such por-
tions of the deck planking of the wreck as could be removed without exposing
the cargo to the risk of damage by sea or rain

   the bottom planking was laid athwartships and four of the planks at
equal distances from each other were carried right through from pontoon to
pontoon-the pontoons being built with a space of six feet clear between
them-thus securely connecting the two together they were decked all
over the deck planking for a length of twelve feet in the middle portion
being also carried right across from one to the other

   the two pontoens were thus securely fastened together above and below
the result being that the entire structure formed a good substantially built
raft having in its center portion a platform or deck measuring twelve feet
fore and aft and eighteen feet athwartships

   the craft-if one may dignify the structure with such a name-was rigged
with one mast situated exactly in the center and well supported by shrouds
on each side and she was provided with a lateen or three cornered sail bent

to a very long yard composed of a number of bamboos fished together the
yard was hung in its center an arrangement by which grant hoped to
succeed in making his raft sail with either end foremost with equal facility
his idea being to work the craft precisely upon the same principle as that
adopted by the lad roue islanders in the working of their flying proas

   this raft though of such liberal dimensions was very easy and simple to
build as there was no shaping of timbers and no elaborate workmanship of
any kind required the only matter involving any considerable degree of care
being that the two pontoons should be watertight and this of course was
very easily managed

   but simple as the work was it was fully a month before the raft was
ready for service though when they at length got her afloat and tried her
the result was satisfactory-far beyond their most sanguine expectations

an episode in a cardboard citys exploded boom-the desperate expedient to which sam
creever resorted to maintain a well intentioned lie

t n a top story room of creevers hotel at goldbrick winthrop rollston
lay tossing in a fever that was at times a delirium his aristocratic
name was all that was left of the once perfectly groomed son and heir of one
of bostons first families the cheeks which had wasted away pitiably were
covered with a stubbly growth of beard the eyes that had been wont to flash
fire on such short provocation were now listless almost glassy  the hands
formerly so perfectly manicured almost showed the bare bones at every joint
while the nails had long been neglected

   and rollston himself he was sadly neglected too at first when he had
fallen ill the men had formed the habit of going to his room regularly to
inquire how he was to ask if they could sit with him or do him some other
kindness but his illness had continued so long that most of those who
knew him best had left gone off to hope gulch where a better paying streak
had been struck nobody expected anything of rollston but that he would
die that he was so long about this was a source of only partially concealed
disgust to mr sam creever the proprietor of the hotel

 i would move out of here if it wasnt for him creever told himself

   it was a fact that but for rollstons sake there did not seem much use in
the landlords remaining iu the town which he had struck on the rise of its
short lived boom his boarders were leaving for hope gulch as fast as they
could get their traps together no new ones arrived to take their places
the outlook was ominous

   even the chinese cook had caught the fever and  given warning mr
creever drew in a long breath when he received the announcement thrust
his hands deep into his trousers pockets and marched up to the top floor to
take a look at his patient
the last man at goldbrick



    therell only be two of us to starve instead of one if i stay he told
himself  maybe i can move him

   creever was something of a doctor-he had been pretty much of every-
thing in his time and he wasnt an old man yet he entered the stifling hot
room and one look at the man on the bed convinced him that it would be
death to take him away

    and its death for him to stay here he muttered mopping the mois-
ture from his brow   but when will it come   

   he stepped over to the bed and taking up one of the wasted hands
counted the pulse

    only a little while he wdiispered  i guess ill wait ill feel easier
then

   the chinaman departed so did the rest of the boarders so did every-
body in goldbrick excepting sam creever and the sick man the town
speedily took  that aspect of decay which follows so swiftly in the wake of
neglect creever hated to go about the deserted streets he preferred to
stay by rollston he at least was living if he was only doing so in a
whisper as it were

   atid the prevailing sentiment in creevers mind was astonishment at him-
self for what he was doing he had never supposed himself to have a
tender heart he remembered distinctly calling down anathemas on his luck
when that friendless good for nothing rollston fell ill on his hands

   when he recalled this something like a blush appeared on his weather
beaten visage

    ive turned softy he muttered and going down stairs he gathered a
few things together and started out along the trail that led to hope gulch

   but he had not gone a mile before he halted and then flung himself im-
patiently on the grass

    its no use he exclaimed  i can hear him calling me back every
step i take i didnt know i was such a tenderfoot

   he returned to the hotel

    i hope hes dead lie groaned out between his teeth as he ascended to
the top floor

   he smiled grimly it seemed to him as if he could feel an increased
respect for himself after having given utterance to this wish

   but rollston wasnt dead he even seemed brighter than usual

   hello creever he said as sam entered that you how are the
boys   

    all  k creever answered promptly

   he shivered as he thought of the possibility of the sick man discovering
that he-creever-had stayed behind for his sake

    oh theyre  lively he went  so lively that i keep em out of
here too much excitement for you you know roily how do you feel 

    ive been out of my head havent i   was the answer

    cant tell you that roily you see you havent talked much of any
so i couldnt tell whether you was in or out of your head but youre
pearter today than ive seen you in some time  

     h


the last man at goldbrick

   yes i feel better for a fact creever guess ill be able to be around
before long pretty near time too must be owing you quite a snug sum
a week or two isnt it  

   it was eiglit weeks since rollston had taken to his bed creever was
thankful there was no one to contradict him when he shamelessly answered 
yes something like ten days roily but i expect a big party in
tonight i must go down and get ready for them

    ask some of the boys to come up and see me after supper wont j-ou
creever i feel just like being livened up a bit

   all right roily theyre the ones to get life out of and creever
hastened off wondering how he could explain the non-appearance of the
boys

   while he was taking his solitary meal an idea occurred to him he
waited until it grew dark and then went up to the room adjoining rollstons
he stood still in the center of it for a minute his head bent in deep thought
then he began to sing

   that is he meant it for singing but his voice was hoarse and then-
well he had no singing voice and never had he could not remember the
words either he started in on a drinking song he remembered having heard
two or three times in a saloon in denver but when he had repeated the first
three lines he found he could not recall the fourth however he did not
allow this to disconcert him he simply run in another line-anything with
which his memory would supply him sometimes it was   on linden when
the sun was low- an echo wafted clear on from his schooldays at others
it would be im called little buttercup or  when i first put this uni-
form on and other excerpts from catchy operas of his day

   it mattered not to creever what their source or the sense they made all
he wanted was noise now and then he interrupted himself for an instant to
give a wild shout sometimes he danced up and down on the shaky floor till
the rafters threatened to leave their supports he picked up a chair and
flung it across the room he did the same with an empty wine bottle he had
brought with him and smiled when he heard the crash it made against the
window frame then he sank down exhausted on a bench near the door

   there he muttered  roily ought to know the boys are having too
lively a time of it to come in and pay him a visit tonight  

   the next morning when he went up with the patients breakfast he began
right away im sorry roily but the boys met some old chums from
frisco here last night they had to celebrate you know so it would have
been a little to npisy to have had em here i spose you heard em  

   yes answered rollston weakly i heard them and they were
having such a jolly time i thought i must have one look at them you
know i was feeling pretty fair yesterday creever so i dragged myself out of
bed and went and peeked in the door

   you peeked in the door  sam creever fairly roared out the words in
his astonishment and consternation

    yes i suppose it was imprudent but i couldnt stand it it isnt very
far and i crept along the hall like a baby tom potts was singing his song
the middle path



when i got there i couldnt help joining in the chorus but nobody heard
me and i was just peeping around the door jamb so they didnt see me either
but why didnt you tell me harry jarvis was back if he hadnt been too
drunk to see last night id tried to get to him but it was too-much for-
me im awfully weak this morning

   rollston ceased and lay looking up at creever whose eyes were by this
time fairly starting from their sockets he was almost beside himself with
terror

   was he the one that was out of his head had the boys really come
back and made things lively last night  he clutched at the bedpost for
support

   or could it be possible that rollston had seen through his scheme and
wanted to make him believe that it had been thoroughly successful but no
the fellow was speaking sincerely to look at him was enough to convince
one of that

   he was trying to say something more now but he had not strength
enough to speak out creever stepped forward and leaned over him

    tell them-tell the boys the sick man said  to come in here and
have their carouse tonight i shant mind the noise and they neednt mind
me im too weak to drag myself to the next room again youll promise
me to do that wcnt you creever 

     yes yes  you want to eat some of these here crackers an go to sleep
now you lost too much rest last night ill tell the boys what you say

   when creever got down stairs again he stood on the porch and scratched
his head in perplexity

    it beats me out its kind o spookish too but what am i goin to do
about tonight  

   but he need not have worried when he went up at noon with almost
the last scrap of provisions in the house he found that his patient would not
know whether the boys accepted his invitation for that night or not

   creever as may have been gathered from the foregoing was not an
emotional man but as he stood looking down at the still white face  im
so glad i stayed he whispered to himself

   he dug the grave as soon as the sun was down and started for hope
gulch the first thing in the morning but he hasnt decided to this day
whether rollston or himself was out of his head that night

the majors plot

a tale of intrigue and mystery involving the penrose family in a network of crime and bringing
more than one life into jeopardy perilous experiences in the indian cavern and a nights
journey which ends in a terrible immurement-ra boldly conceivcd conspiracy
which stops at no expedients and hazards all risks

synopsis of chapters previously published

    dick penrose lives with his grandfather on the squires extensive farm in lewisberry a
country town near harrisburg dicks mother is dead and his father went abroad some fifteen
years before and has not been heard of since till one day he comes back like one risen from
the dead in the shape of major horace penrose who accounts for his prolonged absence and
silence by telling a fearful story of captivity among the moors

     the night of his return a fire breaks out in a store in the village and dick rescues an english-
man who had obtained lodging there for the night this fellow whose name is henry ford
strangely enough is recognized by the major as a valet whom he had brought from london with
him and from whom he became separated in new york he is taken to the farm where he and
his master have many secret interviews

     in course of time the squires health fails mysteriously and dr galen the family physician at
last thinks he discovers evidence of vegetable poisoning being used he sutpects ford and one
night sets dick to watch what goes on in the sick room dick conceals himself in a large
clothes press and is horrified to see his father enter the room take a phial from his pocket and
pour some fluid into the squires medicine before handing it to him hoping that there has
been some mistake the boy determines to hurry off to dr galen at once for an explanation
but in his excitement he leaves the doors of the wardrobe open the major learns that he has
been watched and dick is captured and dosed with chloroform before he can get off the
grounds

    the major proposes sinking dick in the pond at once but ford-who has been roused-in-
sists that the boy shall not be harmed he suggests that he be allowed to take him to the house
of a certain dr clinch near new york and to this the major finally consents ford gets his
charge to harrisburg and into the sleeping car of the midnight train but just as they are about
to start he sees something out of the window that fills him with horrified dismay this is
nothing more nor less than dock dawson a trampish character -whom ford has encountered
in harrisburg aud who knows more about the major than the latter cares to have spread abroad
but it is only a passing glimpse and ford hopes that he has been mistaken

    still under the influence of chloroform dick is taken on his long journey and when he
comes to finds himself in a private insane asylum the second night he manages to escape by
the roof and goes down the fire escape to the second floor then hearing some one passing on
the gravel walk below he steps into the corridor where he is accosted by one of the patients

chapter xxx-in which nellie consults the doctor

w hen dr galen arrived at the farmhouse fresh news was awaiting him

       miller and jackson had just returned from harrisburg they had
found the squires horse at the livery stable and the ticket seller at the sta-
tion had supplied the missing clue

   he remembered selling two tickets to new york he said to a man who
answered fords description they had taken a sleeper on the early train

this story began in the november  issue of the argosy the five back numbers will
be mailed to any address on receipt of  cents
the mators plot



    now said major penrose-they were standing in the hall outside the
squires room- shall i send a detective to new york at once doctor the
boy may be saved yet-unless they have taken passage on some vessel by
this time

    make the attempt by all means returned the doctor  save dick if
you can

   very well replied the major  i will go to harrisburg at once i
fear you will find father somewhat worse the shock has completely broken
him down i will return as soon as possible of course

   he hurried br skly down the stairway and the doctor entered the squires
room old pompey was in attendance and the patient was tying back
among the pillows with glassy eyes and a hectic flush on his cavernous
cheeks

   the doctor shook his head ominously

    slightly delirious he said to himself  completely prostrated its a
bad case very bad if that scoundrel ford has really been poisoning him i
had better start in to counteract the effects of the drug this recent shock is
what i have to fear the most im afraid i cant find an antidote for that

    is ole masr gwtiue ter git well  asked pompey anxiously

     i hope so pompey he needs the very best of care though perhaps
you had better stay here if you can be spared down stairs  

   deed an i kin then ill watch him day an night doctor jess you
tell me wliat ter do an ill do it shuah

    oh you need not do anything in particular except give him his medi-
cine as directed betsy will help you out on the rest the major will re-
turn either tonight or tomorrow morning and i will drop in every hour or so

   the doctor added a few directions about medicine and then went home to
his supper in spite of his cheering words to pompey he had very little hope
for the squires recovery his situation had been critical before dicks base
conduct and ingratitude would prove the last straw

   at ten oclock the doctor returned to the farmhouse the sick mans
condition was unchanged the doctor remained at the bedside until mid-
night then wheels were heard outside and presently the major entered

    i have arranged everything he said as he flung off his furs  full
instructions have been telegraphed to new york and if dick and that rascally
valet of mine are still in the city they will be arrested before morning you
need not be surprised to see dick by this time tomorrow night

   god grant that your prediction come true said the doctor solemnly
 his return may save your fathers life nothing else can

    what  is he so bad as that  exclaimed the major huskily

   he glanced at the bed and then turned abruptly to the window wiping
the tears from his eyes

    ah thought the doctor  how i have misjudged that man  

   the major remained at the window gazing through the curtains at the
black night and presently the doctor went silently away and whispered a
few injunctions to pompey who had followed him into the hall

   late as it was dr galens troubled mind prevented him from sleeping


the majors plot

and lie tossed restlessly on his bed until nearly daylight when in desperation
he swallowed a morphine pill this had a speedy effect and it was very
nearly dinner time when he awoke

   several patients were waiting in the office these he attended to as soon
as he was dressed and then after a light breakfast he hurried off to the
farmhouse

   the squires condition was pretty- much the same his mind wandered
and he talked incessantly about dick

   people were coming constantly from the village the whole neighbor-
hood was in a state of wild excitement for in some unaccountable manner the
tale of the robbery and of dicks flight had been spread far and wide

   walter maynard and jack douglass were at the gate when the doctor
came out and they accosted him eagerly

     im afraid its only too true replied the doctor to their inquiries the
evidence is strong very strong  

   ill never believe it cried walter indignantly  never in the world
and i am surprised at you doctor who have known dick even longer than
we have the man that says dick penrose would deliberately rob his grand-
father and run away with such a vulgar ignorant fellow as that man ford
lies that is all ive got to say about it

   and i say the same exclaimed jack ill never believe it until
dick confesses it with his own lips  

     my brave boys   cried the doctor clasping both their liaids   you have
given me fresh hope fresh courage and i hope that dicks innocence may
yet be proved i am glad that he has two such noble friends left may he
prove worty of your confidence and loyalty  

   the doctor walked homeward greatly cheered by this incident he did
not see his way clear it is true to believe fully in dicks innocence but 
the other hand his convictions had been greatly weakened

   during the next twenty four hours squire penrose became slightly better
mentally but he was constantly growing w-eaker and the doctor unhesi-
tatingly asserted that nothing short of a miracle would cause him to rally

   a dark shadow now rested on the farmhouse all work was suspended
the shutters were closed in the lower part of the house and those who called
to inquire after the good old man who was so much loved and respected in
the neighborhood were met at the door by betsy who spoke with difficulty
and begged them to make  noise when walking off the porch

   at noon of the second day after dicks flight the major returned from
harrisburg with strange and sad news the new york police confessed
themselves at fault the two fugitives had been tracked to jersey citr
there all trace of them had been lost in all probability henry ford and
dick penrose were many miles out at sea

   what slight evidence there was seemed to show that dick was acting of
his own free will

   the boy is a scoundrel said the major  he has killed his grand-
father  and the doctor nodded a willing assent his slight hope of dicks
innocence had vanished before his last overwhelming discover
the majors plot



   two days passed  and dr galens treatment reduced the squires fever
to a minimum he had many lucid intervals in which he recognized those
about him strange to say he spoke but little of dick his thoughts
seemed to be centered more upon his son horace and the major remained
constantly at the bedside

   but now what the doctor had foreseen came to pass the squire was as
weak and helpless as an infant it was impossible that he could gain in
strength for some mental depression was weighing heavily upon his spirits
aud made recovery absolutely hopeless his death was only a question of
days-and very few days at that

   it wtas on the fourth evening of dicks absence dr galen had just
finished his supper aud was vainly trying to interest himself in the columns
of a recent newspaper when a slight knock was heard at the door  come
in said the doctor loudly and the door opened to admit miss nellie maynard
her pretty face and slender form enveloped in a long glistening gossamer for
it was raining outside

   this she flung petulantly upon a chair and drawing a paper from an
inner pocket she handed it to the doctor who had risen to his feet at her
approach and was standing by the table

   dr galen she said with a touch of excitement in her voice you
can read french fluently can you not i do wish you would translate that
paragraph for me its a paper that i found in our front yard nearly a month
ago-how it came there i have not the slightest idea-and i put it away until
i was able to read it-you know i have been taking french lessons lately
this afternoon i happened to pick it up quite by accident and the first thing
i saw was the name penrose on the front page i got out my lexicon and
managed to read the whole paragraph and it was all so awfully strange that

i	thought i would run up and ask your opinion perhaps i did not translate
it correctly

   miss nellie pointed out the paragraph in question with a slender pink
nailed finger and then sank breathlessly into a chair opposite the doctor who
was regarding her half in amazement half in alarm

   he sat down by the lamp however and held the paper close to his eyes

    z bulletin militaire he muttered in a tone of great surprise pub-
lished in paris and dated nearly two months ago  how on earth did this
come to lewisberry  ah here is the paragraph you are right miss
nellie the name penrose is there it must concern our friend the major
you know he served in algeria in fact he probably lost the paper in some
way no doubt he gets it regularly but wait a moment i will read the
article aloud

algeria sept  

    a military cornier just arrived here from metilla a seaport of morocco brings strange
news concerning major horace penrose a brave american who was formerly attached to
the ninth chasseurs but has been in captivity among the moors for the past half dozen
years and had been given up for lost the courier declares that major penrose has just
arrived at the coast terribly enfeebled by disease and privation while in captivity this
if it prove true will be good news to his old comrades in arms

   the doctor read to the last word with unfaltering voice
ioo

the majors plot

     great caesar   he ejaculated  what can this mean major penrose
was in america before the date of this despatch

     so i thought said nellie eagerly and that is why i came to you
with the paper can you explain it 

     no replied the doctor  i cant that paragraph eit ier means noth-
ing at all or it means something too stupendous to realize all at once

chapter xxxi-in which success is just in sight

    dick realized at once that the man glaring through the bars was a genuine
lunatic it was a very critical position and he felt that his chances for
escaping from the building were very small the attendants must be some-
where close at hand and the sound of voices would surely bring them to the
spot

   is that you george washington   exclaimed the man in a louder
whisper than before

    dick turned to the grating-his mind resolved on a suddenly formed reso-
lution

   yes he whispered softly i am general washington who are
you

    why im john andre replied the man  dont you know me gen-
eral  theyre going to hang me in the morning unless you get me away
did ou come to save me 

    hush  not so loud said dick  i will do what i can for you if you
obey my directions go back into the room now and-

   the words faded away on dicks lips and he turned his head quickly
toward the end of the corridor some one was coming up the stairway
the footsteps were plain and unmistakable

   in a moment more the intruder would reach the corridor and as dick
paused not knowing which way to flee his eye caught a gleam of brass in
the keyhole of the maniacs door the jailor had forgotten the key with
a quick movement dick turned it in the lock and glided into the dark room
closing the door softly behind him

     dont make a sound he whispered to his strange companion  or we
are lost they will hang us both  

    the lunatic made no reply but continued to press his face against the
grating the footsteps without came closer and in a few seconds jason
passed the door and continued up the corridor in the direction of the fire
escape

    a tremor of fear passed over dick as he realized the position in which he
had voluntarily placed himself-alone with a lunatic who was evidently of a
dangerous nature judging from the grated hole in his room door

the man turned round presently an laid his hand heavily on dicks arm

    	take me away quick   he said eagerly  dont let them hang me
they say i am a british spy have you seen benedict arnold general 

     sit down on the bed john andre said dick assuming a strange man-
ner  i can do nothing for you unless you do exactly as i say i cannot
th majors plot

iot

take you away now the guards are watching outside presently when the
coast is clear i will slip away and come back with a disguise which will
enable you to pass undetected under the very noses of the guards

   the man pressed dicks hand warmly

   all right general he whispered i will leave everything to you
you will come back soon wont you  

   then as dick assented he walked obediently to the bed and sat down
that instant the footsteps were heard again and jason passed the door on
his way back to the staircase dick waited until all was quiet and then
opening the door noiselessly he crept up the corridor

   the coast was entirely clear he turned the key as carefully as possible
but the slight click brought the lunatic to the grating again

   go back whispered dick and remember what i told you you
shall not be hanged

   to his surprise and relief the man obeyed without a suspicion and leaving
the unfortunate major andres cell dick tiptoed up the hall he rounded
the angle in safety and soon reached the door opening on the fire escape it
had been slightly closed-no doubt by jason it required but a short time to
open it and creeping out on the little iron platform dick drew the door
tightly shut again his situation was now somewhat improved since the
door was closed no-light shone on the fire escape from the corridor and he
was in no danger of detection as long as he remained on his perch

   he had about made up his mind to go down and take the chances when a
shadowy form rounded the angle of the house and tramped along the gravel
walk directly under the fire escape

   crunch  crunch  went the footsteps on the pebbles and then the man
vanished as mysteriously as he had come

   dicks opportunity had arrived quickly and noiselessly he went down
the ladder with a thrill of exultation he found the solid earth under his
feet again the last rung of the ladder rattled in his grasp almost uncon-
sciously he gave it a strong jerk and it tore loose from its fastenings he
was going to throw it away but on second thought he concluded to keep it

   he struck hastily across the lawn and the patches of shrubbery that
grew thickly here and there gave him a sense of protection he could easily
elude the watchman in such a place presently he reached the iron fence-
the only barrier between himself and freedom it was very high and very
strong with sharp jagged points and no apparent method of scaling

    this wont do thought dick  i must find a gate

   he moved cautiously forward and soon turned the southwest corner of
the yard he remembered that the watchman must be somewhere in the
vicinity and redoubled his caution he had now reached the main front of
the house to judge from the numerous lighted windows luckily the
shrubbery was so thick that the rayof light were intercepted before they
could reach the place

   he crept a few yards farther and then paused a break in the bushes
revealed a broad gravel walk bathed in a flood of yellow light this ter-
minated at a gate with two huge iron pillars and half a dozen cross bars


the majors plot

the fence could readily be scaled at this point dick felt sure but it would
be a terribly risky undertaking in the vivid light

   it was his only chance for freedom however and he concluded before
making the attempt to discover the wthereabouts of the watchman he
lingered a moment behind a clump of bushes hoping to see the man he
wanted pass the spot on his regular round of inspection

   all remained quiet and he was about starting away in the direction of the
house when the angry bark of a dog was heard a short distance off dick
had barely time to grasp his iron club firmly when a huge yellow hound
sprang from the bushes he struck the animal a heavy tap on the head and
then sprang aside just missing the open jaws the brute howled with pain
but renewed the attack valiantly dick managed to keep him off with
repeated blows of his weapon he had lost all hope of escape now and was
intent only on saving himself from personal injury he heard a strange
sound behind him but dared not look around then something fell heavily
on the gravel walk the bushes shook violently and a man sprang to dicks
side brandishing a heavy club

    get out on the road cried the stranger and as the dog leaped forward
with a fierce snarl he stretched him lifeless on the ground with a blow of the
heavy club dick witnessed this strange scene with the utmost amazement

   scarcely had the hound been disabled when footsteps were heard tearing
over the gravel the stranger pushed dick into the bushes and crouched
low by his side that moment the watchman reached the spot a lantern in
one hand a revolver in the other he bent partly over the dog astonish-
ment and fear written in every line of his face

   like a flash dicks strange rescuer sprang up and reaching the watchman
at a single leap he bore him heavily to earth the lantern rolled over on the
ground and went out the watchman attempted to cry out but his own
revolver was pressed against his forehead and he speedily altered his mind

    not a sound whispered his assailant  not a sound for your life

   a few seconds passed in silence during which dick could feel his heart
thumping against his ribs

   then the stranger flung him a huge key fastened on a brass ring

    open the gate quick he exclaimed hoarsely  then put the key in
the lock from the outside when you are ready whistle dont lose a
second  

   delighted at the prospect of escape dick plunged through the shrubbery
and gained the gravel walk a glance at the house showed him figures
moving at the lower windows he could hear distant shouts too the mas-
sive gate was just before him with a trembling hand he inserted the key in
the lock

chapter xxxii-in which the metropolis breaks upon dicks

vision

   the key turned harshly and the gate creaked slowly inward revealing
dimly the dusty road outside dick tore loose the key aud thrust it into the
the mafors plot



other side of the lock then he darted quickly through and puckered his
lips to whistle horrors  not a sound could he make

    all right lie cried loudly  come on

   at that moment the door of the house was flung open three or four
men appeared  the threshold and among them dick recognized the doctor
and jason his heart beat violently and he was strongly tempted to take to
his heels without waiting for his new found friend

   then the stranger came dashing to the spot turning once or twice to
point his revolver into the shrubbery he was seen instantly from the house
and with angry shouts the pursuers clattered down the path headed by
jason

    keep back shouted the stranger  keep back   and he waved his
revolver menacingly as he darted through the gate and into the road he
jerked the gate shut with a heavy clang and turned the key in the very
faces of his pursuers

    now cut and run for it my lad he shouted to dick and away they
went together in t he darkness followed by a couple of random shots and a
torrent of abuse from dr clinch and his outwitted attendants

   on and on they ran guided iu their course by the double row of trees
lining the road at length a fence barred the way and here the stranger
made a brief halt

    they are coming he exclaimed and looking back along the road dick
saw a couple of lanterns flashing then came a more ominous sound--the
tramp of hoofs

   the stranger vaulted over the fence and dragged dick after him

   dont be afraid he muttered  they wont ketch us stick close
to me lad and dont be afraid hold on  i have a better plan though

   he seized dicks hand and started on a rapid run across the field a
dark mass was before them and presently they entered a piece of thick wood-
land

   dicks strange companion led on without slackening his pace and for
more than an hour they traveled across country over meadow and forest
past sleeping hamlets and snug farmhouses

   at last the man stopped with a sigh of relief

    i guess weve thrown them off the track this time he muttered as he
wiped the perspiration from his face  an now to find out where we are

   dick made no reply he was intensely curious to know who his strange
rescuer could be but he concluded that it would be better to leave the revela-
tion of the mystery to the stranger himself

   they had halted in a little wooded hollow and starting off again they
reached a point where two roads crossed nailed against a tree a guide post
was visible dick s companion walked to the spot and held a lighted match
over his head this brought out the letters plainly and dick was amazed
to read 

new york  miles

    well i declare he exclaimed in a great wonder   is it possible that i
am near new york how i used to long to see that city


the majors plot

    youll see it soon now said the stranger  pervided that rascal dont
overhaul us on the way didnt you liave any idea where you was 

    not a bit of it said dick  i knew the asylum must be near some
large city but i didnt think i was that far away from home its lucky
you were right outside when the dog attacked me you saved me from
recapture and i owe you a great deal more than you think  

   the man laughed softly

    do you think i dont know you dick penrose why ive been
watchin around that asylum fur three days tryin to think up some way to
get you out i know who put you there too a man who calls himself
henry ford though that aint no more his name than mine is general grant
there is another fellow back of it all-what calls himself horace pen-
rose- 

    yes thats my father interrupted dick  i knew he had a hand in

it

   your father echoed the man  major penrose calls himself your
father does he   and he laughed aloud

   but who are you exclaimed dick excitedly  how do you know
all this and why do you come to my rescue 

   for answer the stranger took a match from his pocket lit it on a fence
rail and then held it close to his face

   dick took one long look and staggered back into the road white as a
sheet

     the man that was drowned he gasped  you are the fellow we pulled
from the creek at rich hill

    right you are my boy  i owe you one on that and he clasped dicks
hand warmly my name is dock dawson   he continued   and i am pretty
well acquainted with things around lewisberry just by chance i got onto
this little racket and followed you an ford clear from harrisburg he had
you chuck full of chloroform so i dont suppose you recollect anything about
the journey

     no said dick  i can recall very little it is all pretty much a blank
to me from the time i left home until i found myself locked up in a room in
a strange house

    hold on said dawson  this aint a very good place to talk-right
on a public road over yonder in the field stands a clump of trees well
go there an sit down you can trust me fully my boy an i want yer to
tell me everything you kin think of-all about ford and major penrose  

   i had better tell him everything dick reflected as he climbed the
fence and walked over to the trees here a fallen log afforded a good seat
and they felt as safe from pursuit as though dr clinch and his asylum were
hundreds of miles away

   after a short interval of silence during which he was puzzled to know
where to start his tale dick commenced at the very beginning with his
fathers return from algeria slowly and plainly he related the rescue of
ford from the burning building his own adventure in the cavern at which
dawson became visibly excited his grandfathers strange illness and finally
the majors plot



the suspicions communicated by dr galen the vigil in the sick room the
awful discovery and the assault on the road to lewisberry

   dawson listened to every word with rapt attention but to dicks surprise
he refused to express an opinion

   theres a big game behind all this he said mysteriously it will
come out in good time i think i see my way pretty clear it will be a big
surprise fur you my lad

   dick put several leading questions to him but received no satisfactory
answer

   at least tell me how you happened to fall into the yellowbreeches at
rich hill and why you disappeared so strangely in the night  he added
persistently

    no time ter go into that now said dawson  the first thing is to get
back to harrisburg squire penrose is in great danger

    you are right exclaimed dick  we must lose no time but how can
we get there  have you any money   

   dawson shook his head ruefully

     a dollar or two that is all

    i have it said dick brightening up when we reach new york i
can get money from home by telegraph

    that wont do said dawson  major horace penrose would get the

message and then-

   dawson puckered his lips and gave vent to a long expressive whistle
 no he added  i think i can borrow enough cash from a pal in new
york to buy our tickets to harrisburg if that fails we can ride home on a
freight or rnebbe you can telegraph to some one else  

    yes i can said dick  dr galen is the very man i was stupid not
to think of him before

    we can decide that point again said dawson   the contract ou hand
now is to reach new york as soon as possible it cant be much more than
midnight now we can make it in two or three hours youre good for
half a dozen miles aint you 

    good for a dozen times that rejoined dick sturdily  put in your
best paces and dont be afraid that ill fall behind

   i dont know about that youngster chuckled dawson you see
trampin is right in my line

    why are you a professional walker  asked dick innocently

   dawson laughed heartily and started away on a brisk trot without making
any reply dick followed with equal celerity and for more than a mile they
jogged along the winding countrj road in silence

   farmhouses were passed very frequently and watchdogs came barking to
the gates but they met no other travelers on foot or by carriage

    it was a good idea of mine to strike back into the country said dawson
ill bet dr clinch went straight to the railroad thinkin wed try to board
some train

    is that the mans name  asked dick  ill remember it he added
to himself
jos

the majors plot

   they trudged on for several hours but the electric brightness of the sky
seemed to come no closer

   its them confounded guide posts said dawson angrily five
miles means ten out in the country were sure to get there some time
though

   when dawn came they were still far up town and just as a neighboring
clock struck eight they crossed the harlem river at one hundred and
thirtieth street

chapter xxxiii-in which dawson identifies the wrong man
who turns out to be the right one after all

   when dick had feasted his eyes on the busy life that surges through
the streets of upper harlem dawson led him to the steps of the elevated
station before he could sufficiently express his surprise he was whisked
upstairs where his companion purchased two tickets and a moment
later dick was looking up long vistas of streets as the train rattled down
third avenue

   that mornings ride he never forgot calais was not more deeply graven
upon the heart of englands queen scores of streets flew by with amazing
rapidity and then came the more compact portion of the city-the sea of
spires towers and roofs  the paved streets jammed with drays carts and
cabs  the sidewalks tenanted with jostling crowds the endless succession of
stores that lined the busy avenue and stranger still perhaps the hasty
glimpses of home life seen through third story windows as the train flew by
-haggard faced people eating sleeping dressing or staring through the
grimy panes

   dawson to whom all this was commonplace enough stared moodily at the
floor of the car

    fourteenth street   cried the brakemau glibly and the train drew up
with a jerk

   dawson raised his head and looked carelessly through the window
that instant another train headed up town stopped on the opposite track

   a swarm of passengers hurried off the platforms and as many fresh ones
crowded in to fill the vacant seats

   all aboard the guard shouted harshly slamming the iron gates
behind the last passenger a man of medium size with a dark complexion and
a light mustache

   as dawsons gaze fell on this stranger his face flushed with excitement
and he rose up in his seat

   get off at the next station ninth street wait for me there he
exclaimed hurriedly to dick

   then he dashed for the platform scattering the indignant passengers
to right and left

     clang   went the gates he was too late before the guard could
raise a hand to stop him he bounded clear over landing feet first on the
girder between the tracks
the majors plot



   the other train was moving slowly but dawson snatched at the platform
of the rear car caught it and drew himself up on hands and knees

   the brakeman was about to throw him forcibly off but as the train was
now moving rapidly he changed his mind and seizing dawson by the
collar he hauled him bodily over the railing

    youll get locked up for this performance my man he exclaimed
angrily

   dawson thrust his hand into his pocket and pressed a coin into the fellows
palm

    i had to do it he whispered  got to see a man on board dont
say a word itll be all right

   before the astonished guard could reply he broke from his detaining
grasp and entered the car he passed hurriedly through and entered the
next one the man he sought was sitting at the farther end glancing at a
morning paper

   lurching from side to side with every motion of the car dawson reached
the spot he stood still regardiug the stranger with such a curious expres-
sion  his face that the passengers looked up half anticipating what was to
follow

   you scoundrel  you assassin   he shouted hoarsely ive got
you now and bending down he grasped the inoffensive man by the collar
and shook him violently	

   the stranger dropped the paper and looked up in astonishment his face
flushing angrily then rising to his feet he shot out his right arm and
struck dawson forcibly on the chest

   dawson prompllv retaliated with a swift blow and in a moment the two
men were struggling on the floor the passengers edged away from the
spot shouting with excitement several made an effort to stop the fight and
the brakeman hurried to their assistance just as the train drew up at the
eighteenth street station

   amid great excitement among the passengers within and without a dozen
strong arms tore the combatants apart both men strove to escape from
those who held them glaring fiercely at each other

    send for an officer cried the stranger  arrest this scoundrel he
is a lunatic i never laid eyes on him before i call the passengers to
witness that the assault was entirely unprovoked  

    yes  yes  thats right  thats true  the assault was entirely unpro-
voked exclaimed half a dozen voices and every one looked threateningly at
dawson

   the brakeman hesitated it was time for the train to start-another train
was close behind-and no officer was in sight

    ill have to take him up to twenty third street he said and walk-
ing to the car door he called out to an official standing near send an
officer up to twenty third street station right away martin

    all right was the reply  ill attend to it

   then the gates clanged shut and the train started

   the brakeman re-entered the car
io

the majors plot

    keep an eye on this fellow will you   he said to the passengers
dawson had ceased his struggles and was regarding his late antagonist
with a marvelous expression of face-fear amazement and incredulity com-
bined

   gents ive made a mistake he said aloud hanged if i havent
blundered  

   the passengers grinned and several laughed derisively

    he cant escape arrest that way said one man

 i beg your pardon dawson went on unheeding the ridicule  i see
now you aint the man i thought you was but blamed if you dont look
enough like him to be his brother such a resemblance i never seen before
dawson drew a long breath and continued to scan the stranger from head
to foot

   the earnestness of his manner impressed the object of his scrutiny

   for whom did you take me he asked half in earnest half in jest
 what is the name of the man to whom i am indebted for this playful
assault-for i suppose you have some grievance against him  

   grievance muttered dawson with clinched teeth well yes i
have-a slight one  

   if you wish to know sir he added more calmly  i will tell you
the man in question-and he looks as much like you as one pea resembles
another-is a certain major horace penrose as he calls himself

    good heavens   cried the stranger trembling like a leaf and clutch-
ing at a strap for support   what do you mean sir  that is my name i
am major horace penrose  

   dawson was struck dumb with amazement it wtas a full minute before
he could find voice to reply and then the train had stopped at twenty third
street

   he leaned toward the stranger and whispered in his ear 

    get me out of this scrape will you an give me a few minutes conver-
sation you wont regret it 

   the man readily assented but it proved an exceedingly difficult task
the brakeman was obdurate

    if the gentleman would not appear against his assailant he declared
 then the company would prosecute on their own account

   matters began to look black for dawson but at the last moment the
brakeman was induced to relent

   the newly found major penrose and his companion hurried down the
steps to the street passing on the way the officer who had been sent for

   now said mr penrose suppose you explain to me all about this
friend of yours who resembles me in appearance and name

    it wont take many words to do that said dawson  his home is in

lewisberry york county pennsylvania-

    what   cried the stranger seizing the others arm in a grip that made
dawson wince did i hear aright why lewisberry is my home or
rather was for it is fifteen years since i saw it last i landed in new york
yesterday from northern africa what has been going on in my absence 
the majors plot

all  i have it i have it that wretch that monster of ingratitude  it is
he who has done this he believes that i will never return-

   the man reeled back against a telegraph pole but dawson caught him
before he could fall

   an officer standing near hurried up to render assistance but it was not
needed mr penrose recovered his strength in a moment and leaning on
dawsons arm he hurried from the avenue into a side street

    now tell me all about this man-this impostor he demanded eagerly
 dont omit a thing

   profiting by the information he had gleaned from dick dawson gave his
companion a tolerably accurate account of the state of affairs at eewisberry
and with each word the strangers agitation increased

    you are the second man to accost me by name since i arrived in new
york he said i met another fellow on lower broadway this morning
he called me major penrose and declared that he had something important
to tell me i appointed an interview with him tonight or rather he ap-
pointed one with me i must go uptown now  business and this afternoon
i must spend some time at the french consulate this interview tonight is
connected i believe with the matter of which we have just spoken i should
like to have you present with me and if you will accompany me to harris-
burg  the midnight train you shall be amply repaid for your lost time i
see that you know something of the antecedents of this false major penrose
but i have no time to lose meet me at seven oclock this evening at the
bowery and chatham square-foot of the elevated station that is where i
agreed to meet the other man at a quarter after seven you will certainly be
there  

    yes said dawson  trust me for that

   he would have said more but he was alone and major penrose was
hurrying up the street toward third avenue

   dawson watched him until he vanished in the crowd and then he walked
rapidly to the nearest elevated station and boarded a down train

   well if this aint the greatest go he muttered an wont somebody
be surprised about this time tomorrow when i show my hand to think of
my strikin the real major penrose an the resemblance  blest if i can
explain that they cant be any relation surely i was going to tell him
about dick being with me but he didnt give me the chance ill keep that
surprise fur tonight

   here dawsons reveries were interrupted by arriving at the ninth street
station and a moment later he was clasping hands with dick who had care-
fully obeyed instructions

   it was a friend i hadnt seen fur years he explained to the boy
 thats why i left you in such a hurry im going to introduce you to him
this evening its all fixed about going to harrisburg too so dont worry
about that

   then dawson led his companion down to the street and up into the station
again  the opposite side where they took the first down train and got off
at canal street


the majors plot

   i cant take you to a fashionable hotel said dawson cause i
havent got the money

   he stopped at an open doorway over which was a sign

empire hotel board

 per week

   a flight of steps led to the second floor here was a big gloomy uncar-
peted room facing the bowery a dozen or more rough looking men were
sitting at round tables reading papers and spitting tobacco juice over the
floor they glanced up carelessly at the newcomers and then resumed their
occupations

   dawson led dick to a remote corner and they seated themselves at a
vacant table

   this is only a lodging house dawson explained the guests take
their meals at neighboring restaurants-and by jove lad i clean forgot you
had no breakfast this morning thatll never do well go out now and fill
up im hungry myself

   this was a welcome proposition to dick dawson took him to an eating
house in a side street and for fifteen cents apiece they obtained a fairly good
meal though by no means such an one as dick was accustomed to at home

    well have dinner at three oclock said dawson  thats the fashion
in new york an a mighty good fashion it is for the pocket book too

   he invested in a three cent cigar and then they walked slowly back to
the hotel

   id like to see something of new york while im here said dick
where is fifth avenue and murray hill and madison square and all
those places that one hears so much about  are they very far away  

    well they aint very close replied dawson  in fact they are too far
away to walk an we cant afford to ride uptown if we want to buy ourselves
a dinner today you see new york again one of these days

   dick was disappointed for a little while but he soon found pleasurable
occupation in watching the busy life of the bowery from the front window
this served to make the hours pass very quickly

   dawson spent most of the time reading the papers provided for the patrons
of the hotel or rather pretending to read for his mind was in too excited a
condition to allow him to concentrate his thoughts on any particular subject

    i wonder who that other fellow can be that major penrose spoke
about he said to himself theres something queer alout that trans-
action to my eye its a funny place to appoint for an interview too-
chatham square however i flatter myself i know new york pretty well
ill make it a point to be on hand early an if there is any underhand busi-
ness in the wind against the major-why it wont come off thats all

   at three oclock they dined-this time at a different restaurant and the
charge was half a dollar for the two

    ive got just a nickel left muttered dawson ruefully as he paid the
score  ill keep it fur luck

   it was a cold disagreeable day so the went back to the hotel dick
going to the window as before and dawson turning his attention to the papers
the majors plot



   at last it began to grow dark outside and a couple of feeble oil lamps
were lighted that shed a sickly glare over the room five oclock came and
then six

   a few moments later dawson rose stretched himself wearily and making
a quiet signal to dick left the room

    i was afraid the proprietor might ask us some unpleasant questions he
said as they passed into the street we aint going back tonight you
know an we didnt pay anything for the use of the room all day

   dick was entranced by the surroundings as he trudged down the bowery
at his companions side the glare of the electric lamps the brilliantly
lighted windows the tide of humanity with its strange types that surged up
and down the sidewalks the tinkling of the street car bells the clang of the
electric motors the rattle of the drays and carts the tremendous roar of the
elevated overhead-all this filled his heart with wonder and amazement

   block after block was passed and then dawson paused  a street corner
before the covered stairway that led to an elevated station  here we are
he said  this is chatham square just on time he added glancing at a
clock in the window of a jewelry store

  chapter xxxiv-in which both lewisberry and mulberry

bend are concerned

   for a very short time we must now carry the reader far away from the
busy metropolis and see how things are faring in eewisberry

   dr galen and nellie maynard spent several hours discussing the strange
article in the french military paper but neither could throw any light upon
the apparent mystery

    it is very plain said the doctor  that major penrose was actually in
america at the date of this algerian dispatch metilla i see by my atlas is
a great distance from algiers the courier must have spent a long time in
making the journey-an interval which might have allowed major penrose to
reach america though i doubt it very much at all events miss nellie you
have done a very wise thing in bringing me this paper and if i make any
startling discovery i will let you know promptly

   for some time after nellies departure the doctor sat under the lamplight
absorbed in deep thought unconsciously he gave utterance to some of his
reflections aloud

   what strange things have come into my head lately he muttered
crumbling the paper fiercely in his hand   and this is by far the most
astounding of all bah  what nonsense it cannot be everybody recog-
nizes him at first sight-even the household servants he is perfectly
familiar with all the happenings in the neighborhood prior to the last fifteen
years he undoubtedly is the squires son-horace penrose i will dismiss
the matter from my mind think no more about it

   the doctor yawned and stretched himself wearily back in his chair the
rain was falling thickly outside but above its patter a sharp rat-tat-tat was
heard at the door


the majors plot

    come in   he cried sharply and the man jackson entered shaking the
water from his clothes he handed the doctor a letter

   from the major sir he said huskily

   dr galen stood under the lamplight and broke the envelope he drew
out the inclosure unfolded it and read the following written in the majors
dashing chirography

dear doctor

    father is slightly better this evening-only the beginning of the end i fear he
knows all of us and speaks lucidly but i can see that something is weighing heavily on
his mind he begs that mr grimwood be sent for at once and requests your presence
also i suppose he is worried about some business matter and i have written to know
whether you think it advisable to send for the attorney or not if you think it should be
done please tell jackson to that effect and he will at once proceed to harrisburg

    suppose you come over as soon as you can

                                                            truly yours

horace penrose

   the doctor dropped the letter and turned to jackson

    you had better go to harrisburg without loss of time and bring mr
grimwood back with you you know where to find him   

    yes said jackson  i know the place good uiglit doctor

   as the door closed behind him dr galen slipped hhrriedly into his boots
and greatcoat

    i think i foresee what is going to take place he said aloud  but be-
fore any business affairs of importance are transacted major penrose shall
account to me for the discrepancy in that algerian dispatch my mind is
firm  that point

   seizing his hat and umbrella he passed out into the rainy night

	     

   and now to return to the man and boy whom we left on watch in chatham
square

   dawson drew dick to the edge of the curbing and then leaning against a
telegraph pole he fixed his eyes on the stairway scanning closely each person
that came down

   five minutes passed and dawson began to show signs of uneasiness
suddenly a ragged little urchin of twelve years paused in front of him

   say mister he piped shrilly  air you lookin fur anybody-a gent
wot wears a dark blue suit an has a yeller mustache 

   dawson looked down on the child in astonishment

    youve hit it my little man thats just the kind of feller im looking
for what do you know about it johnny   

    my name aint johnny was the reply its paddy mick i wus
standin here a little while ago when this ere man in the blue suit come down
from the elevated he waited fur a minit or two an then seein me he
come an tapped me on the shoulder  look here ses he  thars a feller
cornin in ter meet me here i see him cornin down the street now you
follow us an see where we go then come back here agin an by that time
therell be another gent waitin here wot i had an engagement with too
you bring him right along an show him where i am 
the majors plot



    he stuck a dollar in my pocket an just then the cove came up to him
an away they went i followed them close you bet an as soon as i seed
em stowed away i come right back here now air you the right man or
not  

   yes im the right man replied dawson youre safe on that
where did the party take this gentleman   

    oh not fur away said paddy  right round on the bend

    not the mulberry street bend  asked dawson sharply

    right you are thats just the place

   dawsons face turned pale-an occurrence that did not escape dicks
notice-and he thrust his hand back in his hip pocket to assure himself that
the revolver was still there

   lead the way paddy he said briefly and dont lose any valuable
time about it

   the lad turned directly off the bowery and went confidently ahead with
dick and dawson at his heels

    the street grew darker shabbier and more lonely the lad made several
turns and then plunged fearlessly into the worst the most squalid locality
that even new york can boast of-mulberry street

   on and  they went until the flickering gas lamps revealed a curve
ahead for the street was built in the shape of a crescent they were now in
the famous bend

    dick of course through ignorance did not realize the dangerous ground
he was treading the scene around him with the debased phases of human
life was full of absorbing interest the sidewalks were irregular and full of
broken ruts the streets were narrow aud the dingy frowning houses that
towered aloft on each side seemed to shut off every breath of fresh air the
atmosphere was foul and stagnant at this hour of the evening many
people were on the street all italians with swarthy villainous faces dressed
in hideous rags

   the basements of the houses seemed given over to trade and through the
dirty window panes could be seen foul smelling butcher stalls stacks of
decayed vegetables and fruit-for the mulberry street purveyors deal in
second hand stock procured probably from refuse barrels or from those who
make a business of begging at the area doors of up town houses some of
the dishes on mulberry street supper tables that night might have graced the
boards of an astor or a vanderbilt that morning the whole scene was one
of intense misery and squalor

   dicks curiosity was succeeded by revulsion and he was glad when paddy
stopped before a gloomy four story house near the very center of the bend
not a ray of light was visible either in the basement or from the upper
windows

      are you sure this is the place    asked dawson

   dead sure replied paddy  they went right in here an shut the
door  

   dawson stood still for a moment apparently uncertain what to do a
dozen rough looking men were standing in groups near by watching the


the majors plot

strangers keenly dawson looked in vain for the blue coat and brass buttons
of an officer-a sight that would have been quite welcome at the time

   suddenly from the house came a single sharp cry-loud and piercing it
was followed by dead silence

    that means murder exclaimed dawson

   he dashed up the steps and tried the handle of the door to his surprise
it flew open revealing the utter darkness of the hall

    paddy run for an officer as quick as you can he cried  dick you
follow close behind me here is a box of matches keep one lighted all the
time

   paddy was already off on a run and drawing his revolver in plain view of
the sullen looking italians in the street dawson darted into the hallway and
dick followed striking match after match

chapter xxxv-in which many things occur

   at the foot of the stairway dawson and dick paused a scuffling noise
could be plainly heard as though somebody was bumping violently against
furniture

   at the far end of the hall a dim light was seen as if coming from the
crack of a door the staircase was old and rotten dawson tore loose one
of the banister posts and with this in one hand and the revolver in the other
he crept down the uncarpeted hallway toward the faint glimmer

  help help

   the piteous appeal echoed through the house and on the instant the door
was flung open in dawsons very face and a man rushed into the hall

   his back was turned toward the lighted room and his face was invisible 
but he saw dawson plainly enough and the discovery brought a cry of alarm
to his lips that was smothered instantly when dawsons heavy club descended
on his head and felled him to the floor

    lie there you scoundrel shouted dawson and then he dashed into
the lighted room with dick at his heels

   here a strange scene met their eyes the apartment was small with
greasy walls and uucarpeted floor half a dozen chairs and two small tables
were scattered about in various stages of dilapidation and in the midst of this
wreckage two men were struggling fiercely rolling over and over aud clutch-
ing each others throats near by lay a huge knife with a long gleaming
blade

   dawson sprang forward and as the men rolled within reach he seized
the uppermost-a dirty italian with horribly repulsive face and dragged him
by main force from his victim then as the fellow rushed furiously at him
he stunned him with a blowr from the butt of his revolver the other man
rose slowly to his feet and staggered toward dawson with outstretched
hands

   you came just in time he whispered hoarsely  the scoundrel en-
ticed me here with a plausible tale and then his confederate tried to put an
end to me with the knife where is the other rascal  has he escaped   
the mators plot



   before dawson could reply a commotion was heard in the hall and paddy
burst into the room followed by two officers who led between them the man
whom dawson had struck down with the club

   dick who had been standing near the door started back with amazement
as his eyes fell on the prisoner

    henry ford   he gasped  you here 

   dawson was  less surprised i thought so he cried so you
were at the bottom of this cockney bill

   ford made no reply his face was haggard with terror and he was
trembling violently for here before him was the man whom he had believed
dead-whom with his own hands he had thrust mercilessly into the old well
at rich hill

   then dick for the first time saw plainly the features of the stranger
whom dawson had rescued from the italian

    my father   he exclaimed excitedly  major penrose  

   on hearing this the man turned pale

    what does this mean  he demanded of dawson  who is this boy 
why does he call me father  i am mad or dreaming  

   this is dick penrose your own son said dawson solemnly you
are neither mad nor dreaming and turning to dick he added   this is
your real father my boy-not the black hearted scoundrel you have known
by that name

   a brief silence ensued broken only by a hoarse groan from ford  then
father and son met in a fervent embrace

	     

   the explanations that followed this strange and affecting reunion the
reader can readily divine to a future chapter must be left the more detailed
account of the remarkable circumstances which led to this dramatic episode
and the revelation of the most astounding and daring plot ever conceived by
human ingenuity

   the officers at once clapped handcuffs on ford and the italian who had
by this time recovered consciousness they then proceeded to search the
premises leaving the two prisoners in care of dawson and major penrose

   watching his opportunity ford whispered in dawsons ear get me
hout of this scrape old man an ill go back to harrisburg an make a clean
breast of the ole matter dont leave me in the hands of the new york
police-theyll soon find out who i am

   the major overheard this conversation and coming close up to ford he
asked him several questions in a low voice

   fords reply had a startling effect upon him and turning to dawson he
said 

      it is of the utmost importance that this man should be saved from arrest
though he did try to take my life he is only a tool of the greater villain
and his presence will be needed at lewisberry tomorrow how can it be
arranged   

   dawson reflected a moment

    i thought of this before he replied  so i kicked the knife down a


the majors plot

hole in the floor accuse the italian of an attempted robbery and let the
officers suppose that the man ford was going for assistance when i met him
in the hall and knocked him down say you will appear against the italian
in the morning stick to this story and slip a ten dollar bill in the officers
hands if you get a chance

   whether the major followed this last piece of advice or not we are unable
to state  but at all events a quarter of an hour later the two officers departed
in one direction with their italian prisoner while dawson major penrose
dick and ford went the other way having dismissed paddy mick with a
substantial reward

   although not ostensibly a prisoner ford would have found it impossible
to escape from his companions had he been inclined to try the experiment
a cab was procured on the bowery and the whole party were driven to an
uptown hotel where major penrose stopped only long enough to secure a
small amount of personal baggage

   thence they went directly to jersey city and took the midnight train for
harrisburg

chapter xxxvi -in which the curtain rises on the beginning

of the end

   it was very nearly midnight when dr galen reached the farmhouse
the major answered his slight rap on the door and led him straight to the
sick room squire penrose was slightly raised upon two pillows his eyes
were wide open and he was perfectly conscious

   he recognized the doctor and inquired anxiously for mr grimwood

 he will be here presently said the major  dont worry father

   this seemed to pacify the squire for he closed his eyes and fell asleep
almost instantly dr galen and the major conversed in low tones while the
hours dragged slowly by at five oclock in the morning jackson returned

    mr grimwood is out of the city he said  but his family expect him
back at six oclock they promised to send him over at once so i thought
i had better return home and tell you

   the squire now awoke and inquired anxiously for the attorney dr
galen and the major held a hasty consultation the major was quite
nervous the doctor cool and collected

   your father is losing strength rapidly he said  but by the aid of a
stimulant he can be kept up for possibly twenty four hours beyond that time
i dare make  assertion  

   the squire was informed that mr grimwood would arrive in a couple of
hours this had such a pleasing effect that no stimulant was necessary just
then

   he became much brighter and declared that he was feeling quite com-
fortable at seven oclock the major retired to his room with the avowed
intention of taking a short nap several times the knocker  the front door
was heard and the doctor went softly down stairs to answer any inquiries
that might be made concerning the squires condition
the majors plot



   meeting pompey in the lower hall a sudden idea flashed into his mind
and drawing the old man into a secluded corner he said abruptly   pompey
are you certain that this major penrose up stairs is really the squires son
horace the lad whom you nursed in infancy 

   pompey nodded sadly  yes sail thar aint no doubt on that it am de
same boy but law bless yer doctor he aint got the same disposition what
he had when he was little but thar aint no doubt about it am thar   he
added suddenly  cause little horace had a pink mark on his arm bove de
elbow what looked jest like a strawberry

     did he  asked the doctor in a tone of great interest  no pompey
i dont think there is any doubt when mr grimwood arrives come up
stairs with him and wait outside in the hall

   this event occurred almost immediately wheels rattled into the yard
and the attorney stepped upon the porch j st as pompey opened the door
he threw his wet coat and hat  the rack shook hands with the doctor
and then followed him up stairs bearing a small russia leather valise in
his hand the major had returned to the sick room looking somewhat
brighter from his short nap at sight of mr grimwood the squires eyes
brightened aud he stretched out a trembling hand to greet him

   the attorney sat down close to the bedside and carried  a whispered
conversation with the sick man

    then he walked across to the table opened the valise and took out paper
pens aud ink

     your father is desirous of making a new will he said curtly addressing
the major i suppose you will certify dr galen that he is in his right
mind and senses 

     he is beyond a doubt replied the doctor quietly

     then it only remains for me to obey his dictation said mr grimwood
he drew the table to the bedside arranged the writing materials and took
his seat ready to begin

   at this point dr galen turned suddenly pale catching the majors eye
he motioned significantly and then left the room the major followed him
into the hall

   pompey was standing by dicks room the door to which was wide
open

   the doctor quickly entered beckoning both to follow him he closed the
door quietly and turned to the major whose countenance showed the surprise
that he felt

   major penrose he said calmly i hope you will pardon the strange
request i am going to make of you an affair of the deepest importance is
about to be transacted in the next apartment i have reason to believe that
squire penrose is going to make an important change in his will in your
favor before that document is signed i must demand of you some more
convincing proof of your identity than you have yet shown according to
pompeys statement you should have on your right arm a mark resembling a
strawberry have you any objection to revealing this   

    if the doctor actually had any doubts they were instantly banished


the majors plot

   with a sneering smile on his lips major penrose drew off his coat laid it
calmly on a cliair and then quickly bared his right arm

    there he said stretching it out and the doctor saw plainly an oval
pink mark in the firm white flesh

    dat settles it said pompey  it am de same mark

   dr galen attempted to utter a feeble apology

    dont i beg of you said the major pleasantly  i dont bear any
malice at all it was quite a proper proceeding on your part and i honor you
all the more for your loyalty to the family  

   he drew on his coat and led the way back to the sick room this little
episode had occupied but a few moments mr grimwood had not yet touched
pen or paper

   he motioned dr galen and the major to seat themselves and they took
chairs near the bed

    the squire wishes that you should both be present he said  all is
readj now he added bending toward the sick man

    first of all began the squire in quite a firm and audible voice  i
want it understood that i revoke all former wills and codicils then as mr
grimwood began to write rapidly he dictated one after another a number
of small legacies to distant relatives and friends and to the household servants
at this point mr grimwood read aloud what he had written

    yes said the squire approvingly  that is all right now mr grim-
wood i wish to leave the sum of ten thousand dollars to my grandson
richard or rather the yearly interest of that sum bad as he has behaved
i feel that i should make some little provision for him at his death let the
principal revert to his family-should he have one-otherwise to the samari-
tan hospital at harrisburg

   mr grimwood wrote briskly for a few moments and the scratching of
his pen was the only sound heard in the room then he stopped and turned
inquiringly to the sick man

    the balance of my property real and personal said the squire feebly
 goes to my son horace with one condition only attached-that the home
farm shall never be sold i believe that is all i appoint you and my son
horace joint administrators

   mr grimwoods pen began to move rapidly over the paper dr galen
watched every movement of the hand that was scribbling dick penroses for-
tune away from him and the major turned his gaze steadily on the floor

    i think i have everything right said mr grimwood as he laid his pen
aside and applied a blotting sheet to his writing

   he held the document up where the light could fall upon it and read it
aloud from beginning to end in a hard business like voice

   not a word was lost on his hearers and the squire nodded a full assent

   but the dictation had been a trying ordeal and now he sank down among
the bedclothes breathing heavily

   dr galen was quickly at his side feeling his pulse and then his heart

   the major rose to his feet ghastly pale  the will that made him a
wealthy man was yet unsigned
palmistry



   he is in no immediate danger said the doctor reassuringly the
effort has exhausted him

   he administered a few drops of a stimulating medicine and the squire
soon opened his eyes and looked around at the occupants of the room while
a faint flush appeared on his cheek

    the pen he whispered hoarsely  hand me the pen

   he made a visible attempt to rise in bed and the doctor with mr
grimwoods assistance lifted him to a sitting posture and placed two pillows
behind him

   at that moment wheels rattled over the gravel road outside and paused
before the house it is doubtful if those in the room heard the sound so
deeply interested were they in what was going on before them

   a small drawer was taken from the table and placed bottom up on the bed
before the squire

   on this mr grimwood placed the open will

    dr galen you and i will witness the signature he said and then he
handed the pen to the squire who seized it firmly between his thumb and
forefingers

   for half a dozen seconds the room was so quiet that a pin could have been
heard to drop every eye was turned on the squire as his trembling hand
sought the blank space at the bottom of the will and already the pen had
marred the whiteness of the paper with the beginning of his signature when
a confused trampling of feet was heard from the corridor and mingled with
it the low hum of voices

   as the sound came closer and closer the three men standing by the bed-
side glanced inquiringly at each other and then at the door while the squire
allowed the pen to drop from his nerveless fingers

   something strangely like a sob was heard in the hall and for a brief
instant the sounds were hushed

   then-the door was opened wide and dick penrose walked straight into
the room behind him in single file came dock dawson henry ford and
a stranger with tanned skin and fair mustache old pompey and betsy
brought up the rear trembling with excitement

lost on the great belt

a fearful experience among the ice cakes of the danish sea-perils attending a novel means
of transport when boats were turned into sledges

p hat thrilling night adventure on tlie frozen waters of the danish sea
has left memories that time can never dull and more than one experi-
ence of that sort a man doesnt care to pass through in a lifetime

   it was fred mayne who first suggested that wandering tour in denmark
as a happy change from the well beaten continental paths and fred it was
too who got us into the scrape though through no fault of his own poor
fellow

   he had slipped off a mountain ledge away ujd in jutland aud before his
broken leg had knit the autumn had passed into winter

   we made all haste to reach copenhagen but a sudden cold snap swooped
down upon us and when we arrived at nyburg early in december the
great belt was a sea of ice

   only once or twice in ten years perhaps does this happen for the current
is fierce and strong but when one of these severe winters does come and the
great belt freezes over a novel device is used to carry the mails and the
passengers from island to island the ice boat transport they call it and it
consists of large boats capable of holding ten persons and yet light enough
to be easily dragged over the ice by four men

   open spaces are often reached and the ice by reason of the strong
current is liable to break up very suddenly so that sledges cannot safely be
used

   three days we waited together with a constantly increasing number of
passengers and a large amount of back mail for the ice gave promise of
breaking up aud allowing the steamers to cross on the fourth day how-
ever it grew colder and the next morning it was decided to start

   it was a strange and novel sight to see the procession winding across the
frozen sea for all the world like a caravan on a desert of ice there were in
all some twenty boats each drawn by the sturdy transport men who were
strong hard fellows while the passengers who were of various nationalities
walked alongside or lent their assistance to the boatmen among them were
several ladies who were not compelled to walk but sat snugly among the
mail pouches

   our boat was the first to start and captain fane who was one of the
most skilled pilots of the great belt walked ahead sounding the ice con-
stantly with a huge staff while his four assistants came close behind drag-
ging the boat with comparative ease by means of oars lashed across the bow
and stern fred and i walked alongside wrapped up warmly in great danish
coats that we had purchased at nyburg
lost on the great belt

iioi

    the dull leaden sky hung close over us and a hazy mist in the atmos-
phere soon hid the shore in our rear while the zealand coast in front of us
was completely invisible it was a great desert of ice and strangely enough
when we had tramped over the monotonous surface for several hours we
seemed to be floating in space for on all sides the line of the horizon was lost
completely merged in the dusky sky

    several times captain fane halted to snuff the air and looked uneasily
about him  and presently it grew strangely white in the distance and a fierce
snow storm came beating down on us from the north

   keep close to the boat directed the captain dont lose sight of
it and as the flakes fell in a blinding cloud we stumbled on tripping con-
stantly over blocks of ice but never for an instant taking our gaze from the
dark outlines of the boat and the stout form of the captain ahead of it

   soon we became separated from the rest and saw dark forms moving
vaguely on our right and left while some of the boats turned back and we
heard faint shouts from time to time as they receded in the distance

    but captain fane went steadily on and we followed him blindly through
the storm once through the driving snow something dark loomed up and
we heard the dashing of waves

    it was a break in the ice and without hesitation the boat was shoved into
the water and we hastily took our seats while four stout pair of oars carried
us across this unknown expanse of sea

    the captain looked grave for the wind and current were terribly strong
and iu spite of all efforts we were losing ground presently the storm lifted
just long enough for us to make a difficult landing on the ice again and then
it gathered round us with redoubled fury

   we moved forward very slowly and cautiously never taking our hands
from the side of the boat and once i thought we were lost for the captain
examined a small compass with an air of uneasiness  but presently loud
above the whistling of the wind came a dull booming sound

    faster now said the captain cheerily that is the signal gun at
korsor  

    korsor was the transport station on the opposite side of the belt where
supplies and extra boats are kept the little signal gun kept booming loudly
at intervals a welcome sound no doubt to all the scattered boats

    we hurried on unceasingly until the gun already had a plainer sound and
then a catastrophe occurred with startling suddenness a terrific blast of
wind filled with hail and snow blew over us like a hurricane and as we
crouched and bent before its stinging force a report like a cannon shot rang
iu our ears and went echoing past in the distance while we felt the ice part
beneath us and the black waters surged madly up boiling and hissing about
our feet the sea was throwing off its icy fetters

    i made a frantic leap into the boat dragging after me mayne who had
sunk to his waist then to our horror we saw captain fane struggling amid
the broken ice

    holding  to his staff which rested on two cakes he was making des-
perate efforts to raise his body from the water while the great blocks that


lost on the great belt

 surged around him threatened every instant to crush him in their icy
 embrace i gave a cry of horror as he missed an oar that was extended to
 him

    then the boat lunged forward one of the men leaned out and caught the
 captains staff and in a minute he was dragged unhurt on board

    shaking off the water he looked around him and began to count eagerly

      one two three four five six-where is hamar   he cried and then i
 saw that one man was missing on all sides we searched but no trace of him
 was seen he must have been instantly forced under water

     a tear trickled down the captains furrowed cheek and he repeated inces-
 santly  poor hamar  poor hamar  how can i tell his wife while the
 brave sailors seemed stupefied by their comrades death

    there was no time for mourning however for the situation was perilous
 - in the extreme and we felt there was little chance of ever seeing home again
 the storm was now at its height and mingled with the wind and the patter
 of sleet and hail we heard the sickening crush of great blocks of ice grinding
 against one another and the angry moaning of the sea while the boat
 plunged dizzily up and down creaking in every timber as some huge cake
 rushed into violent collision with it

     with their oars the sailors attempted to ward off the dangerous blows and
 finally succeeded in heading the boat with the current with the gale in our
 teeth we floated to the north while fred and i seated on the mail bags
 watched with mute despair the hurrying sea of ice around us

     faster and faster came the snow and at times it nearly blinded us hiding
 everything from view then at intervals the wind would fall and wte could see
 for a long distance the broken field of ice motionless it seemed to us for the
 boat was gliding along with equal speed

     captain fane stood with arms folded looking straight before him and the
 boatmen in dull resignation whispered among themselves while all the time
 we were drifting rapidly toward the open waters of the cattegat where chance
 of rescue would be small indeed

     the booming of the signal gun became fainter and fainter and then ceased
 entirely it grew bitterly cold and to keep from freezing we were obliged to
 stamp up and down the boat once when the storm had lifted we caught
 sight of a dark object some distance away and when we all shouted a faint
 cry came back in return it was one of the other boats drifting nearly par-
 allel with us but it was evidently heavily freighted for it lay low in the
 water and the ice as it rose and fell seemed to hide it from view

     we seemed for a little while to be drawing nearer and the shouts came to
 our ears more distinctly but suddenly another flurry of snow came on dense
 and blinding and the wind blew with such awful force that the boat
 threatened to go over and the ice thundered against it on all sides

    in terror we clung to the bottom boards expecting each moment to be our
 last while the boatmen stood bravely to their posts and kept the boat balanced
 on its keel

    the severity of the storm blew over after a while and the whirling snow
 cloud lifted again we looked anxiously for the other boat but though we
lost on the great belt



could see half a mile around not a thing was in sight only the ice and the
dark gloomy sky

    has the boat gone down  cried fred and the captain nodded his head
in silent assent

   hours passed by-hours of long and wretched misery-while the snow
fell steadily the wind had died away and the still cold numbed our limbs
and made us drowsy we would have gone calmly to sleep on the mail bags
never to awaken again but the boatmen more inured to the rugged climate
dragged us roughly to our feet and rubbed snow on our faces and made us
take the poles and ward off the threatening cakes of ice

   at last as night approached the sky grew darker and dimmer and the
snow seemed whiter in contrast as darkness came on the snow ceased falling
entirely and after a while we saw stars peeping out from the broken clouds

   we drifted on and  in the gloom each moment that passed making the
situation more hopeless and despairing we refused to abandon hope
entirely though for all we knew we wrere even now far out on the cattegat
it was calm and still no sounds to be heard but the low harsh grinding of
the ice

   suddenly a great bar of yellow light shone out in the darkness dazzling
our eyes with its brightness and shedding a golden pathway across the drift-
ing ice

    the island of sprogo   cried the captain and the boatmen all shouted
for joy

   then in an instant i knew where we were

   the island and lighthouse of sprogo stand at the northern entrance
to the great belt midway in the channel beyond it lies the cattegat

   i	an instant the men had seized the oars and with all their power tried
to force the boat sideways against the ice it was folly to attempt it the
oars were broken and split at once and the boat swung back into the current
with a jerk that nearly upset it

   then all shouted for the island was only a few yards away and in the
gloom we saw figures moving to and fro at the foot of the lighthouse and
heard distinctly their answering hails

   a fire was started and as the flames danced among the rocks we could
almost count the moving blocks of ice that lay between us and the shore

   suddenly captain fane stood up in the end of the boat and addressed the
men in a loud voice waving his hands and pointing to the land what he
was saying fred and i could not understand for he spoke in the danish
tongue but the men only hung their heads and made no reply

   the captain hesitated a brief second then with a scornful gesture and
without another word he hastily snatched up a coil of rope from an open
locker aud attached one end firmly to a great iron ring in the bow of the
boat he next coiled the rope up  the seat aud taking the other end
firmly in his hand stepped over the side  a great cake of ice that was float-
ing past and started to make his way toward shore

   no one raised a hand to stop him and in horror we looked on while those
 the beach gave one cheer and then watched him too in breathless silence


lost on the great belt

the fire crackled and roared merrily and by its flickering light the brave
captain stepped from cake to cake and coil after coil of the rope ran out

   once he slipped and tossed up his arms but the block he was on bore him
well and he leaped in safety to the next one another and another was
safely passed over and now the shore seemed very near and the eager
watchers were close to the verge ready to clutch the rope on which our very
lives depended but the treacherous current had swept us farther away and
even as he prepared for one final leap the last coil ran out the rope tightened
and as the jerk came captain fane tossed up his arms and shot down among
the ice blocks

   i saw the water spurt up in the firelight i remember the cry of horror
and despair that rose from those on shore and the lost ones in the boat and
then i knew no more



   when consciousness came back to me it was dark the stars were hid
and the snow was falling again while far in the distance a pale faint gleam
marked the sight of sprogo lighthouse fred was rubbing my face with
snow and the crew were sitting hopelessly on the mail bags

   we were now far out on the cattegat for the ice had nearly vanished
only stray cakes floating along here and there while in its place -sirere the
black crested waves

   i shuddered as i thought of the fate of captain fane for i did not think
it possible he could have been saved it was the hunger and cold together
with the excitement that had caused my fainting spell and now fred
too became weak for it was early morning since either of us had tasted
food

   the horrors of that night are not to be described it grew colder and
colder the wind blew and the snow came down again in blinding squalls
while all the time we were moving farther and farther from all hope of
rescue the boatmen sat in a kind of stupor talking among themselves in a
strange tongue

   at last we gave up all hope was gone and we must starve or freeze to
death unless indeed the boat would upset and make a speedy end of our
sufferings

   it was long after midnight and already half stupefied we lay huddled up
among the mail bags when fred raised his head and hoarsely whispered
 hark  

   the boatmen too were roused and listened eagerly and above the wind
i heard faintly a curious puffing sound what it meant never flashed across
me it seemed to come nearer and as we all rose to our feet a light flashed
through the mist of snow-a faint dusky gleam

   we shouted with all our might and as if in answer to our cries the
great black hull of a steamboat loomed up out of the darkness and her
paddles churned the water into billows that tossed us to and fro

   again and again we shrieked imploringly but the black monster shot
past leaving us plunging about in its wake then the paddles ceased to
revolve and the vessel lay motionless on the sea while dark forms appeared
romance versus reality

 

on deck and we heard voices calling loudly the men sprang to the two
remaining pairs of oars and bent to them with all their might

   slowly we drew near voices called to us encouragingly and then as ropes
were slung over the steamers side we clambered up on deck

   it was a government steamer hunting up the scattered transport boats

   by morning the ice was all out of the great belt and we steamed slowly
into the channel stopping on the way at sprogo light to pick up a number
of rescued transport passengers and to our great surprise captain fane
himself who had made a miraculous escape

   the same afternoon we landed at korsor in safety two of the boats
were never heard of again but all the rest succeeded in reaching places
of safety

making a man of himself

a breezy story of the adirondacfcs-an ambitious young americans struggle to solvethe
mystery of his environment-the pitfalls set for him by his enemies
and his plucky fight for justice and the right

synopsis of chapters previously published

    clifton commonly called  clipper  graves has lived with his mother in a cabin in the
adirondack wilderness as long as he can remember one day while out hunting with stilt
buckram an old guide he finds a pocketbook containing  the name almon gaybroon is in
it whom buckram declares to be one of the meanest men that ever came into the north woods
but his whereabouts is unknown and clipper gives the pocketbook to his mother to keep until
the owner can be found something in the name suggests the past to mrs graves and she is
about to tell clipper why his father buried himself in the wilderness where he finally
died when a flood sweeps away their cabin and the mother is drowned in digging about the
ruins the next summer clipper unearths an old chest he breaks it open and finds a package
containing  together with a note signed by his own father to the effect that the money is
a portion of  stolen from the vault in the treasury of the city of pinkingham the docu-
ment further sets forth that david graves is not the real name of its signer which is to be found
in a statement in the hands of his wife this has been swept away in the flood

    meantime the summer season opens and one day while out rowing  the lake clipper falls
in with perry bunse a new york boy whose boat has been stolen from him by fordy gay-
broon who with two of his friends is camping out in the neighborhood clipper undertakes
to get it back for him and after a lively battle succeeds in doing this but is eventually captured
himself fordy announces his intention of gridironing the young thief and treats him so
roughly that his own followers interfere the matter ends by tom little and life murkison
going off to stay in stilt buckrams cabin where buck ward afterwards joins them meantime
perry bunses father comes to the woods and clipper learns that he was janitor of the bank at
pinkingham at the time of the robbery he also learns that mr gaybroon was treasurer of
pinkingham at the same period

    a little later the gaybroons find in the woods a green box in which clippers mother had
kept her combs and from bucks report clipper who now knows that his last name is benedict
is convinced that the missing statement is in that box during the gaybroons absence he goes to
their camp accompanied by mr bunse to whom he has told his story and possesses himself of
the precious document soon afterwards they encounter the father and son both in a highly
excited frame of mind and mr bunse declares that they may as well face the music there and
then

chapter xxxi-a suspension of hostilities

h ord pulled with all his might for he seemed to fear that clipper
would endeavor to keep out of his way  but instead of doing so the
latter lay upon his oars and allowed the pursuers to come alongside

   clipper said mr gaybroon evidently struggling with his emotions
 i went over to flash river to see you

     i heard you were there sir replied the hunter respectfully

    since you have been away i have carefully considered what has passed
between fordv and myself  the one hand and you on the other and i

this story began m the october  issue of the argosy the five back numbers will be
mailed to any address on receipt of  cents
making a man of himself



have come to the conclusion that we have been too hard upon you i am
sorry for it and i ask your pardon  

    i say the same thing clipper added fordy though there was not a
little of his former haughtiness in his manner

   i have no ill will against you mr gaybroon or against fordy re-
plied clipper gently   i am as willing to be friends now as i was in the
first of it

    then we will consider that matter settled and i hope we shall be good
friends in the future added mr gaybroon

   it will not be my fault if we are not replied the hunter  i have
been trying to make a man of myself and i dont want to quarrel with any-
body

    there is one other thing i want to talk over with you clipper con-
tinued the ex-treasurer trying to smile in the excitement that agitated him
i hear that you are a very well educated young man and since your
parents are both dead it occurred to me that you might obtain a situation in
mendoro where i live

     i had not thought of leaving the wilderness   answered clipper   i
am very well contented here

    but it is a great pity that a young man of your talent and ability should
live alone in the woods away from the advantages of society pleaded mr
gaybroon in insinuating tones  it is time that you were doing something
to make your fortune and get settled in life

    i was thinking of that ver thing myself added mr bunse  it is a
great pity for so good a boy as clipper to waste his time in this savage life  

      it isnt so savage but that you come here in the summer from the cities  
said clipper

    it is a fine place to spend a few months in the summer  but it is the rest
of the year that i was thinking of added the hotel keeper you are
almost alone here eight months of the year

   i dare say you dont go to church every sunday clipper suggested
mr gaybroon who thought doubtless that this was a great hardship
though he never entered a place of worship from one years end to the other

    i have been to meeting in the school house fifteen miles from here
replied clipper  i should be very glad to go to church every sunday if
i got the chance but we are not heatheu in the woods my mother always
gave me a bible lesson every sunday and read sermons to me so that i know
what they are like

    i should like to talk with you alone clipper about this and some other
matters said mr gaybroon glancing at the ex-janitor

   i will see ou tomorrow sir when i come down from the castle
replied the hunter looking at mr bunse as if to ascertain whether or not
he approved of such an appointment

    couldnt you go over to the shanty with me this afternoon no time
is as good as the present added the ex-treasurer with what was intended for
a winning smile

   	 why do you wish to see me alone mr gaybroon  mr bunse is a good
iios

making a man of himself

friend of mine and knows all about my affairs inquired clipper thinking
they were getting a little nearer to the point

   to be plain i want to ask you some questions about your mother that
you may not like to answer before a third person i think i was acquainted
with your mother  and if she is the lady i think she was i can tell you
something that will be greatly to your advantage  in a word something that
may put you in possession of a very handsome little property  

    i will call at your camp tomorrow i hope i shall be able to find a deer
or two in the hills this afternoon if i do i will take some venison to you
replied the hunter

   mr gaybroou was very anxious to have the interview that afternoon 
but mr bunse and clipper both persisted that they had business up the lake
and could not possibly attend to the matter then the ex-treasurer was
plainly very much disappointed  but he finally said he would be at the shanty
at ten the next forenoon clipper resumed his oars and in a few minutes he
was out of hearing of the other boat

   what do you make of that mr bunse asked clipper earnestly
 he didnt say a word about the valise or the statement

      i expected a warm time of it with him and i was prepared to see him and
his son resort to violence it simply looks as though gaybroou had hatched
up some scheme to get out of the scrape replied the hotel keeper  he
used to be a cunning man as we may learn from the paper of course you
will not meet him alone at his camp   

    why not i am not afraid of him though i think i shall keep my rifle
in my hand while the talk is going on

   you may be tempted or compelled to shoot him clipper

     i dout believe i shall for he will not dare to touch me while i have the
shooter in my hand

    but you may fall in some trap set for you dont you see that the man
has motive enough to murder you  you hold hts reputation and fortune in
the hollow of your hand added mr bunse with energy  he means to
buy you off if he can  and if he cant he will do the next thing  and what
that may be i dont know

    i dont feel a bit worried about what he may do now that i have the
paper in my pocket isnt it very strange he didnt say anything about the
tin box   

    very likely he has not discovered his loss yet he went over to camp
buckram to see you on the whole i dont believe he knows the statement
is not in his valise at this moment he could not have seen us going to the
shanty could he continued mr bunse musing

    he could not see us and he could not have known before he returned
that we had been there answered clipper positively

    it dont make any difference what he knows or what he dont know
he wants the package of bills that is hidden at the castle and he would be
willing to give you any sum to get it even if it were the whole twenty
thousand dollars it contains

     but it is not his to give
making a man of himself



   that wouldnt make the least difference to him you will have a
chance to make a man of yourself before you get through this business i
never before heard of a boy like you being tempted with such a sum of
money and if you come out right you will be a full fledged man good
heaven  you have the money now and you could go to parts unknown
and be a rich man for the rest of your lifetime you neednt stop to dicker
with mr gaybroon about it either

     do you think that after my father and mother had kept that money so
many years i would touch it  demanded clipper with some indignation in
his tones and manner

 it amazes me my dear boy that you havent gone off with it added
mr bunse with enthusiasm  your father knew the worth of money if
you do not here in the woods and how he kept twenty thousand dollars hid
in the ground for years without spending a penny is the wonder of the age
 my father was an honest man

     and his son is as honest as he was but i am boiling over with anxiety
to know if the money is where you put it clipper after we have looked
things over up here we shall know better what to do

   by this time the boat was at the head of navigation clipper and mr
bunse landed and the boat was carried up to the ford for this was the
quickest way to reach the castle when they left the boat it was not thought
necessary to conceal the lucy and they hastened up the hill to the shop
 whats that  asked mr bunse as they read the sign which clipper had
placed  the door   enter not  beware of spring guns   

     the door is still locked added clipper as he tried it and then inserted
the key he only looked in  everything is just as i left it and they have
not been in

    it would take some pluck to try to open that door while that warning is
posted on it added the hotel keeper

    mr gaybroon is more afraid of a gun than he is of the evil one
said clipper as he ran down the hill to tlie site of the cabin

     they have done a good deal of hard work here  continued mr bunse
the ex-treasurer aud his son had dug the ground over in the most
thorough manner they had turned up the earth over a space four times as
large as the site of the cabin why they found nothing was patent to the
observers and they hastened back to the castle where clipper began to tear
up the faced logs that formed the floor of the shop

chapter xxxii-the cashiers written statement

    i am sure it is all right mr bunse said clipper when he reached
the earth under the shop and saw that it had not been disturbed   shall i
dig up the package  

    if you are perfectly sure it is there we wont disturb it at present
replied mr bunse

    i am sure the ground has not been touched if they didnt come into
the shop they couldnt have got at it
iiio

making a man of himself

    i want to know what is in the statement before we do anything more
added the hotel keeper as he assisted in replacing the floor of the shop it
isnt possible that fordy could have followed us up here and seen us take up
the floor is it clipper 

    they couldnt have got up here by this time for when we were off cape
island they were near the head of peach bay but i think we had better go
out doors so that we can see or hear the approach of any person  

   they went out of the shop clipper locking the door and seated them-
selves on a log on the bank of the river any visitor who did not cross the
stream at the ford would have to come up the other side clipper took the
important document from his pocket and unfolded it it was in the form of
a letter addressed to clifton benedict but it was a very long and minute
account of the transaction at the city hall in pinkingham

   then your name is not clipper but clifton said mr bunse  let
me look at the paper before you begin to read it  and clifton passed it to
him it is signed by your father and i know it is in his handwriting
only the substance of the paper need be given

   leon benedict was the cashier in the office of the treasurer of the city
about six months before the robbery of the vault an unreasonable creditor
had pressed him hard to pay a bill of fifty dollars he had not the money by
him then though he had three hundred dollars in the savings bank

   he could not draw the money that day and the creditor threatened to
trustee his salary he was a timid man and he took a fifty dollar bill from
the drawer of the treasurer and paid the bill the next day he drew the
monej and restored the sum he had taken

   at this point the cashier enlarged at great length upon the folly of taking
the money in his charge even for a single day he cautioned his sou never
to do such a thing as his father had done if he took the money once or a
dozen times and returned it each time opened the way fora repetition of the
dangerous experiment

   there was something peculiar about the fifty dollar bill mr benedict had
paid to his creditor the next day after the cashier had restored the amount
he had borrowed and had gone to dinner the same bill came back iu pay-
ment for an ordinary tax mr gaybroon who was at the counter identified
it he inquired where the taxpayer had obtained it and ascertained that it
had been paid to him by mr benedict and he had seen him take it from the
drawer

   the treasurer charged the cashier with the theft the latter was over-
whelmed with terror he explained the matter and stated that he had re-
stored the amount a count of the cash assured mr gaybroou that his funds
were all right but the treasurer was merciless with his tongue and the
employe believed that he was ruined it was a trivial fault but in a public
position it was enough to blast his reputation

   the cashier pleaded for himself and his family and at last the treasurer
appeared to relent and promised not to expose him the writer of the state-
ment declared that this event was only the introduction and preparation for a
more serious one
making a man of himself

mi

   a rebate on the taxes paid before a certain day was allowed in the city
on the last day of grace a very large amount was paid into the treasury all
in the office were exceedingly busy and the treasurer declared that he had
not time to make up his deposit before the bank closed after shutting up
the money was counted and a package of seventy thousand dollars was made
up and put in the vault by mr gaybroon himself

    i remember it well said mr bunse  i heard him say that one
bundle contained fifty thousand and the other twenty thousand each to go
to a different bank the next day your father was going to start to see his
uncle in vermont the next morning and had brought his trunk to the office
for he lived a little way out of the city

   mr benedict said that his wife and child were to go with him and remain
at his uncles for some time he had been waiting till the hurry was over
and it ended on that last day of grace to the taxpayers on account of the
large sum in the vault mr gaybroon had requested the cashier and the
janitor to watch in the office that night

    thats the point  now hes coming to it   exclaimed the ex-janitor
impatiently

   the cashier put some things into the trunk and went to his supper about
six leaving the treasurer and the janitor in the office he did not notice
that he had left the key in the trunk until his return he did not know
what had happened in his absence

    i know what happened   ejaculated mr bunse  but goon

   mr benedict remained with the janitor all night and he was sure the
vault was not opened while he was there in the morning after mr gay-
broon came to the office he had gone out for his breakfast his wife had
come in a carriage and they had started on their journey

   i remember it all as though it were only yesterday added the hotel
keeper   what i did not understand then i understand perfectly now  

   the cashier went to burlington where he remained over night he was
to take a stage in the morning for the home of his uncle in the evening he
had occasion to repack his trunk and in the bottom of it he found the
package of twenty thousand dollars which he and the treasurer had made up
for deposit it was done up in a handkerchief which bore the name of
a gaybroon

    now you come to it clipper said mr bunse so excited by the nar-
rative that he could hardly keep his seat on the log

   the cashier described his feelings at great length when he discovered the
money in his trunk he was as nearly distracted and insane as he could be
it was strange that the telegraph had not already flashed the news of his
crime and caused his arrest the money would be found upon him and he
would be ruined

   he realized that the treasurer was the robber he had taken the fifty
thousand dollar package and placed the other where it would convict the
cashier it was a conspiracy the fact that he had once taken fifty
dollars from the drawer would be brought out now the treasurer could
swear to it and the cashier could not deny it
iii

making a man of himself

   mr benedict was overwhelmed by the perils of the situation in which he
found himself placed he felt certain that he should be convicted of the
crime he lost his courage  he became as weak morally as a child in the
cradle he told his wife all about it she counselled him to put the money
in the safe of the hotel and hasten back to pinkington he had not the
pluck to do it the treasurer was the robber aud was sure to overwhelm him

      what a pity he did not take the advice of your mother    exclaimed
mr bunse  if i had known then what i know now gaybroon would at
this moment be serving out his sentence in the state prison

   the cashier in his paper condemned himself because he had not followed
the advice of his wife the memory of his first trivial fault haunted
him and prevented him from being a true man he changed his plans at
once and in another hour he and his little family were on the train hurrying
to the north from st albans bay he took a steamer to plattsburgh and
from there fled into the adirondack woods where he had established himself
on the bank of the smoker river

   he had brought the money with him and buried it under his house when
he had built one every year he had intended to go out and seek the means
of establishing his innocence as well as to restore the money to the city but
he had never had the courage to face the consequences if he could find the
janitor of the city hall he thought he could prove that the vault had not been
opened during the night and the restoration of the money would tell in his
favor

   the statement instructed his sou what to do and how to do it he was to
find john bunse but above all he was to restore the money in tlfe original
handkerchief in which it was inclosed

   your father was as innocent of that robbery as you are clipper ex-
claimed the hotel keeper if he had only come to me   

   do you know anything more than is stated in this paper asked
clifton not less excited than his companion

   do i know anything more i saw gaybroon open that trunk which
belonged to your father and take the tray out while there was a package
done up in a white handkerchief on the floor by his side  replied mr
bunse springing to his feet and using some very energetic gestures

     and you have kept still about it all this time   demanded clifton

    how could i know what was in that package i didnt even think of
it again until the next day protested the hotelkeeper  now hear my
story for your father did not know all that happened nor anything after he
left  

    clifton was all attention

chapter xxxiii-the night watch in the treasury

    let me look at that paper a moment clipper said mr bunse before
he began his statement

    the hotel keeper looked the paper over for a few minutes in silence evi-
dently trying to find something which clifton had read
making a man of himself



   here it is your father says he went to supper about six leaving the
treasurer and the janitor in the office said he when he had found the place
 the safe had not been closed when the cashier left your father had not
been gone five minutes before gaybroon went into the vault

      he came out in half a minute with a large leather satchel in his hand
iu which he carried papers and money about town he threw it carelessly
into a chair and locked the vault he fussed some time with the key at the
lock

   	 he acted a little nervous and strange to me he walked up and down
the room half a dozen times and then looked at his watch still holding it
in his hand he told me i had better go to supper i left the office and shut
the door after me but by the time i reached the street door i happened to
think i had left a bundle which had come that day by express for my wife

    i went back after it it was a sash door opening from the hall and i
could see through into the front of the office your fathers trunk was in
the corner opposite the door gaybroon had opened it and was taking out
the tray on the floor at his side was a package done up in a white hand-
kerchief just then gaybroon began to get up and i moved out of sight for
i didnt care to have him see me watching him

     didnt you go in   asked clifton breathless with interest

     i heard his step iu the office and i walked out to the door by the street
i had no more suspicion that anything was out of the way my dear boy
than i had that the sky would fall i only wondered what he was doing in
your fathers trunk i did not want to lose my place and i couldnt afford
to quarrel with the treasurer

    but a minute later i decided to go back and get my bundle when i
opened the door gaybroon was just shutting down the lid of the trunk he
spoke to me and wanted to know what that trunk was brought to the office
for i explained that the cashier was going off with his wife and child the
next morning

      gaybroon said the trunk might j ust as well have been brought down by
the carriage in which his wife and child came to the station then he said
he believed it was brought there for some bad purpose and he had been look-
ing to see what there was in it

    i asked him if he had found anything in it that didnt belong there
then he told me that he had some doubts about the cashiers honesty and he
wanted to make sure that there was no money in it that belonged to the city

i took my bundle and weut to my supper i wasnt gone fifteen minutes for
i lived close to the city hall

    when i got back the treasurer was alone but mr benedict came in a
few minutes mr gaybroori picked up the daily papers in the office put
them into the satchel and left he often carried the bag home with him for
he said he worked on his papers in the evening before he went he charged
the cashier and me to keep a sharp lookout and when he had gone i locked
the street door and the inside one

    didnt you say anjthing to my father about the treasurer opening his
trunk asked clifton
i

making a man of himself

     bless you no my dear boy  your father was as sensitive as a spring-
chicken and it would have made him feel bad for a year if he had known
that gaybroon suspected him of anything replied mr bunse warmly
 the treasurer told me he found nothing in the trunk and that was enough
for me i looked upon your father as a very fine man and i wouldnt have
hurt his feelings for a hundred dollars your father went to his trunk
fussed awhile at it and then locked it up this time he put the key into his
pocket

     we talked about the business of the day for a while and then he began
to gape for he was very tired i told him it was no use for both of us to
keep awake all night one of us might just as well sleep while the other
kept watch we hoisted a big sofa so heavy it was all both of us could do
to lift it in front of the door of the vault your father went to sleep on it 
and he did not wake till the clock on the city hall struck two then i took
a nap till six we put the sofa back in its place no one could have opened
the door of the vault while it was in front of it

    but when was the money taken out   asked clifton

    i couldnt have told you then but i can now replied mr bunse with
his teeth grating together  gaybroon took it before he closed the vault
 when he came out of the vault with the satchel you mean 

   to be sure that was the last time the vault was opened till the lock-
smith opened it gaybroon came to the office before the cashier left and
wished him a pleasant journey at nine oclock when the treasurer went to
open the vault he could not turn the key we all tried our hands at it but
the door could not be opened all the locksmiths in town tried to get it
open and failed we telegraphed to new york city for the maker of the
lock and he arrived the next morning

    he fished out a piece of iron that had been dropped into the keyhole
and then opened the door with gaybroons key then the treasurer dis-
covered that the two packages containing the seventy thousand dollars were
gone of course there was a big outcry at once the cashier was gone and
nobody but he could have taken the monejr

      the treasurer telegraphed to the place in vermont where the cashier had
gone  but he had not been there officers were put upon his track and he
was traced to burlington where he had taken a train going north he had
left the train at st albans there they lost him descriptions of him were
sent to montreal and quebec

   what did mr gaybroon say  asked clifton

     he said the same that everybody else did when the cashier could not
be found nobody doubted that he had taken the money

    didnt you doubt it mr bunse

    to tell you the truth my dear boy i did not i couldnt explain it in
any other way tasked gaybroon if he had not searched the trunk  and he
told me he had but he had not done it thoroughly he felt very bad
because he had not looked at its contents more carefully he asked me not
to say that he had looked into the trunk i did not want to lose my place
and i kept still
making a man of himself



    but you knew that the vault had not been opened in the absence of the
treasurer suggested clifton

    of course i believed he had taken the packages before the treasurer
went into the vault if i had read this statement then i should have known
better the cashier was never found gaybroon resigned soon after
within a year a hundred dollar bill was brought into the office which the
owner was willing to swear he had paid into the treasury for his taxes on the
last daj of grace

    this bill was traced to gaybroon he had received it for his salary on
that very daj- and had kept it nearly a year soon after he moved to
meudoro  and i did not see him again till i met him at the plainbridge
hotel

    i went into the hotel business in new york soon after but that bill
traced to feaybroon opened my eyes i went over the whole of it with my
wife that night  but the more we talked about the matter the more strange
it seemed to me

   the fact that the cashier did not come back that nothing could be
ascertained in regard to him made it look very bad for him if he had re-
turned he and i could have proved that gaybroon stole the money he was
the last man in the vault before it was closed i know now that he put the two
packages of bills into his satchel one of them lie placed in your fathers
trunk and the other he carried away when he left all this is very clear to
me now

     i wrish he had gone back when my mother advised him to do so   said 
clifton sadly

    it cant be helped now though it was a bad mistake but is the hand-
kerchief with the package now    asked mr bunse

      i did not see the handkerchief but there are plenty of old rags in the
box with the money what shall we do next 

   it is hard to say what we ought to do next my dear boy replied the
hotel keeper as he looked over the statement again  we know the truth
now but the question is what can be proved

    dont my fathers statement prove anything  

    i dont know whether it would be admitted as evidence or not replied
mr bunse as he looked over the leaves of the paper  why what is this 

 subscribed and sworn to   here is the name of squire gifford  your father
must have taken this instrument to him

    clifton looked at the paper again

      what we are to do is very plain now   added the hotel keeper   we
will see squire gifford in the morning and take his advice added mr
bunse evidently greatly relieved

   they slept in the shop that night and the next morning the box was 
taken from its hiding place the old rags were carefully examined and the
white handkerchief of the treasurer was found to be the last envelope of the
bills

   taking the package with them they hastened to the hotel where squire
gifford was found he had not read the statement though it had been
iil

making a man of himself

sworn to before him it was decided that clifton should keep his appoint-
ment and he went alone to the shanty though he carried his rifle with him

chapter xxxiv-the meeting at the shanty

   clifton was not exactly pleased with the idea of confronting mr gay-
broon and his son alone at the shanty under the present circumstances but
he had promised to do so and he felt obliged to keep his word as he landed
on the shore he was rather surprised to see a carriage with two horses stand-
ing near the camp the team was tied to a tree and it looked as though it
was there for a purpose

   he landed and drew his boat upon the shore but he saw nothing of mr
gaybroon and fordy he walked towards the shanty but before he could
reach it he saw both of them come out loaded with baggage the moment
they saw him they retreated to the house again with their loads it looked
as though they were preparing to leave

   clifton had come a full half hour before the appointed time for he did
not know the hour when he left the hotel by this time he did not believe
mr gaybroon was very anxious to find a situation for him in mendoro or in
any other place or that he felt any great interest in his moral and spiritual
welfare

   the first thing clifton did was to wonder why the father and son had
retreated to the shanty as soon as they saw him if they wanted to leave
they had a perfect right to do so it was nobodys business but their own
he concluded that fordy must feel very homesick since all his friends upon
whom he had relied for a good time had deserted him but mr gaybroon
soon appeared at the door of the shanty

   he walked down to the place where clifton stood leaning upon his rifle
the latter thought it very strange that fordy did not come with him but
presently he saw him carrying a valise to the carriage it was no use to at-
tempt to conceal what had already been disclosed

    you are ahead of time clipper but i am glad to see you said mr
gaybroon trying to smile  but why did you bring that rifle with you 

    i generally carry it with me when i go any where i am a hunter and
i sometimes see a deer or some other game and i like to be ready replied
clifton

    i received a letter from home last night and i must be there as soon as
possible fordys friends are all down upon him and he has decided to go
with me continued mr gaybroon  have you thought of what i said to
you yesterday afternoon   

    i have thought about it and i talked with mr bunse this morning
on the subject i dont think i shall stay in the woods another winter but i
am not ready to go yet

     the situation i spoke to you about is in my office in mendoro you are
just the person i want and i will give you ten dollars a week all the year
round i will do everything in my power to make it pleasant and happy for
you 
making a man of himself



   i think i will not go at present replied clifton who knew that this
was not the business of the interview

    do you think you can make as much money as that here in the woods
clipper asked mr gaybroon

    i know i cant sir but i dont want to leave now and you seem to be
all ready to go

   we must start very soon in order to get the train to ogdensburg you
seem to be well dressed this morning after a week or two you can come up
and settle your affairs  

   i think i wont go today sir persisted the hunter  i shouldnt
want to go off without saying a word to stilt buckram

    you can see him when you come up again

   mr gaybroon continued to argue the matter but it was clear enough
that he had no interest in what he was talking about clifton expected him
to lead the conversation in some manner to the statement of the cashier but
he did not hint at it

   while he was waiting for this topic to be touched upon he saw fordy
driving the two horses attached to the carriage furiously down toward the
lake he was sitting upon the front seat but he was leaning forward as if
he was reaching for something and it looked as though something was the
matter

    stop them  stop them   shouted fordy as the team approached to the
spot where his father stood

   they are running away with him   exclaimed mr gaybroon appar-
ently very much alarmed   fordy is careless and he has dropped the reins
he will be killed  

    i can stop the horses easily enough replied clifton

   but whatever fordy was doing to recover the reins it was plain that it
frightened the horses and they increased their speed as they approached the
water clifton dropped his rifle for he needed both hands so that he could
grasp the bridle of each horse

   the moment clifton threw his rifle upon the ground mr gaybroon
picked it up and tossed it out into the deep waters of the lake

   the horses were not half so furious as they had appeared to be a moment
before in fact they stopped as soon as the hunter went in front of them

   mr gaybroon had gone behind clifton to pick up the rifle as soon as
he had tossed it into the lake he sprang upon his victim the dangerous
weapon was out of the way and there was no longer any especial danger
in attacking the hunter which was plainty enough now the program for the
occasion

   the ex-treasurer threw his arms around the shoulders of clifton and then
dropped upon the ground so that his foe should fall under him fordy
leaped down from the carriage and produced some small ropes with which
he and his father secured the wrists of the prisoner then his ankles were
tied together

   beneath the heavy form of mr gaybroon clifton found it impossible to
make any resistance he was bound hand and foot when he saw the rifle
iii

making a man of himself

splash in the water and that the horses were not half so spirited as they had
appeared to be he began to comprehend why his persecutor had desired to
see him alone

   his captors afforded him no time for consideration but immediately
hoisted him into the vehicle and placed him upon the back seat mr gay-
broon took the place by his side and fordy having recovered the reins
which he had thrown out drove up to the shanty his father asked to see if
anything had been left and then to lock the door

   fordy obeyed and when the door of the shanty was secured he took his
place on the front seat and drove off the valises and other baggage had
been stowed away in the vehicle and it was evident that the shantyites had
taken final leave of the camp and the wilderness

    clifton saw that it was useless to have any words with his captors if they
did not insult and abuse him with their lawless tongues he did not believe
that he could obtain any intimation of their intentions from them

    what time is it father  asked fordy when he had driven almost to
the road

    it is just ten replied mr gaybroon after he had looked at his watch
 we have twenty five miles to go but the first train we can reach goes at
ten forty three

    but we must hurry up or they may catch us added fordy nervously

    who will catch us no one knows what we are about

      some one may have seen us  

    of course the will know at the stable that we were going but clipper
is not in the way of telling anybody that he went with us  

   mr gaybroon chuckled as though he thought the departure had been
well managed presently he took from his pocket a flask and filling the cup
full of whiskey he drank it off the carriage came to the road and took
the way to the north the hotel was in the opposite direction

   when the carriage had gone about ten miles mr gaybroon told his son
to turn into a road that led into the woods saying that this was as good a
place as any half a mile from the highway the carriage stopped and mr
gaybroon got out dragging his prisoner after him

     now clipper i want that paper your father wrote   said the ex-
treasurer

    i havent it with me replied the victim

   his persecutor did not wait to hear anything more but proceeded to
search him he handled him very roughly but he found nothing he
vented his rage in heavy oaths and then took another heavy dram from his
bottle

   during the ride of ten miles which had taken two hours and a half
clifton had been at work on the cords that bouud his wrists fordy had tied
them together and he had done it in a very bungling manner he had suc-
ceeded in loosening them enough to enable him to slip out his hands

   while his persecutor was taking his dram clifton drew out his hands
taking his knife from his pocket he cut the lines on his ankles and he was
free he did not stop to speak a word but ran with all his might back to
making a man of himself



the main road before he reached it he heard the rattle of wheels he
increased his speed and reached the highway before the carriage

    it contained clayton mr bunse and squire gifford

chapter xxxv-the guests of the city

     oh cliftou my dear boy   exclaimed mr bunse  i was afraid some-
thing terrible had happened to you where is gaybroon 

    in as few words as possible clifton told what had transpired at the shanty
and in the woods from which he had just come mr gaybroon had chased
him but he was too tipsy to make any great speed the road in the forest
had not been wide enough for ford to turn the carriage and he had probably
gone to fiul a better place

   how do you happen to be here mr bunse  asked clifton you
could not have known what mr gaybroon meant to do with me  

     i did not after he had read the statement and heard all i had to say
about it squire gifford was satisfied that gaybroon robbed the treasury of
the city of piukingham  and he thought the evidence would convict him
though your fathers statement is not worth the paper it is written on iu
court replied the hotel keeper

    but the testimony of mr bunse and your own i think will enable the
government to make out a pretty strong case added squire gifford  at
any rate i mean to have him arrested as a suspicious person and telegraph to
the police of pinkingham

     but how happened you to think that he had gone this way    asked
clifton   i did not expect anybody to come after me  and mr gaybroon
could not or he would not have stopped so long in the woods

      squire gifford sent for clayton to make the arrest and we were all going
over to the shanty together for i was rather afraid they would do you harm
then clayton told us he had let a double team to gaybroon to go to
malone  

      he told me he had a letter the night before which required him to get
home as soon as possible added clayton

    it was half past ten when we got to the camp continued mr bunse
 the shanty was locked and  one was to be seen then i began to sus-
pect that the carriage was to carry you off my dear boy clayton has his
fast horses and we have made good time  the road  

      hark  i hear the carriage    interposed the stable keeper

   clayton had already driven his team into the woods and fastened the
horses to a tree where it could not be seen by the gaybroons the whole
party retired behind a clump of bushes and in silence awaited the arrival of
the vehicle

    we shall not see anything more of him said mr gaybroon as fordy
stopped the horses  you were stupid that you did not tie his hands
properly  

     i did the best i could replied fordy sourly for he did not allow any
one not even his father to find fault with him or call him hard names  i


making a man of himself

wasnt stupid enough to steal seventy thousand dollars and then throw away
twenty thousand dollars of it  

   clayton nudged clifton who was standing next to him the officer took
out his memorandum book and made a note of the remark of fordy

    it was not stupid my son   protested the father warmly and it was
evident that this point had been discussed before  dont i tell you that i
could hold on to the fifty thousand dollars only by fastening the robbery on
the cashier

   clayton wrote as fast as he could and soon had the very words of the ex-
treasurer down in his book

 what shall we do now   growled fordy  you might as well look
for a needle at the bottom of the lake as to try to find clipper in these woods  
we must go back again clipper has the statement and the twenty
thousand dollars and we must get them both or get him replied the father

    i dont believe clipper knows where the money is we had the paper
but we couldnt find the chest with the package in it argued fordy  im
not going back again   

   but fordy it is utter ruin to me to leave things as they are now
added mr gaybroon as he produced his flask again

   he was so tipsy now that he appeared to have lost all caution though if
he had been entirely sober he could have had no suspicion that any listeners
were near a very angry discussion between the father and son followed
and while it was in progress the party stepped out of the bushes and con-
fronted the bank robber

   mr bunse rushed to the heads of the horses and took them by the
bridles clayton approached the carriage on one side and squire gifford on
the other mr gaybroons chin seemed to drop down a couple of inches
when he saw his carriage surrounded in this manner fordy was astonished
but he was the cooler of the two neither of them appeared to understand
what it all meant

    what do you want what do you mean by this outrage demanded
mr gaybroon whose tones were rather thick since his last dram

    we mean to arrest you for the robbery of the vault of the city of pink-
ingham replied clayton

    arrest me exclaimed the ex-treasurer aghast at the announcement
 that was eight years ago and the man that did it fled to foreign parts

    so we all read in the newspapers at the time added squire gifford
we believed it then but we dont believe it now

     have you a warrant for my arrest    inquired mr gaybroon in tremb-
ling tones

   not yet but we will have the warrant in due time answered the
squire   i think we might as well proceed to malone without any further
delay there is no lack of evidence now where is clipper   

   i sent him back to see that my horses didnt run away replied
clayton with a significant wink

   the party from the lake had brought the package of bills and it was
under the back seat of their carriage clifton had been sent back to see that
making a man of himself



nothing happened to it the officer gave a long whistle and the hunter
drove the other team to the spot

    gentlemen you are making a terrible mistake said mr gaybroon in
shaky tones  dont you see that what you say is quite impossible 

    i dont see it if i were the government attorney i should believe i
had a first rate case added the squire if you have any objection to
being committed to malone jail on the charge of robbing the treasury of
pinkingham perhaps i can make it pleasanter for you by causing your arrest
for an assault upon clifton benedict

   thats clipper i suppose said fordy as the hunter drove the other
team up to the place where the party were

    thats what he used to be called  but i give him his right name

     he is a villain and if we dont get even with him yet it will be because
i dont live long enough do you mean to say that you are going to arrest
my father for a crime committed by clippers father 

    not at all  we are going to arrest him for a crime your father com-
mitted and i am very sorry he has not done better by you in precept and
example  

    i think we had better be moving on clayton interposed i will
drive this team so that i can be with my prisoner and clipper shall sit beside
him iet fordy ride with you in the other carriage with the squire and mr
bunse

    i am going to ride with my father protested fordy

     ride in the other carriage or we will leave you here replied the officer
 we dont want anything of you and dont care whether you go with us or
not

   fordy concluded not to make any trouble under these circumstances and
took his place by the side of the squire clayton started his team mr
gaybroon did what other men in trouble have done he comforted himself
with the bottle in his pocket and when the party stopped at ayres for din-
ner he was too tipsy to think of escaping if there had been any chance for
him to do so

   towards night the party arrived at malone and the ex-treasurer was
committed to the county jail to await the arrival of officers from pinkingham
the squire telegraphed that the crime could be proved and that the son of
the cashier would arrive on the following evening

   by the night train mr bunse and clifton proceeded to ogdensburg and
arrived at pinkingham at the time stated the ex-janitor had the package
of bills in his lap during the entire journey and held on to it even when he
took his meals on their arrival they hastened to the city hall where they
found the mayor and most of the city officials

    you give us most astounding news said colonel brockway the chair-
man of the finance committee after mr bunse and clifton had introduced
themselves

   so i should say here is the first piece of evidence replied mr
bunse as he laid the package upon the table in the treasury office  i am
glad to get rid of the responsibility of it here is the statement of leon
i 

making a man of himself

benedict the cashier you can read it while his son and i go to the hotel
and get some supper

   mr bunse delivered the package to colonel brockway desiring him not
to open it until his return one of the officials took them to the hotel and
informed the landlord that they were the guests of the city

chapter xxxvi-good by to the wilderness

   when  the guests of the city  returned to the treasury office they
found that colonel brockway had read the statement aloud

    this is good as far as it goes but it wont prove that gaybroon robbed
the vault said the chairman of the committee

    i am aware of that sir but i was the janitor of the building and
watched here with the cashier on the night that the vault is said to have been
robbed replied mr bunse  i can tell what i saw and know

   it required two hours to go over the whole matter the package was
opened and the handkerchief in which mr gaybroon had inclosed the
bundle before he put it in the trunk was produced not one of the officials
suggested a doubt as to the guilt of the ex-treasurer  but some of them were
lawyers and were not clear that the crime could be proved since the affidavit
of the deceased cashier could hardly be admitted as evidence

   then we shall prove it by gaybroons own confession replied mr
bunse stoutly  we can bring four witnesses who heard him admit that he
robbed the vault and gave up twenty thousand so that he could keep the
other fifty

   we do not doubt the truth of the statement and we have sent two
officers with a warrant to bring gaybroon to pinkingham on the strength of
what you telegraphed replied colonel brockway instead of being a
thief the cashier appears to have been a man of the most remarkable
honesty  

     he was an honest and true man and it is a great pity that he was so
timid added mr bunse  he taught his son that the chief business of a
boy was to make a man of himself  and clifton is as honest as his father was  

     the young man has made a splendid record for himself and as he is an
orphan now i hope he will make his home in pinkingham such a young
fellow as he is will find plenty of friends here added the mayor  he has
put twenty thousand dollars in the treasury of the city whatever becomes of
gaybroon

   we shall call on the bondsmen of gaybroon for the rest of the seventh-
thousand   said colonel brockway  as you are one of them mr mayor
i advise you to attach gaybroons property iu mendoro

    i shall do it replied the mayor

   but nothing more could be done until the arrival of the prisoner during
the following day clifton made a great many acquaintances and found himself
to be an object of no little curiosity in fact he was the lion of the day in
the evening when mr gaybroon arrived attended by the officers who had
been sent for him and by clayton there was another conference
making a man of himself



      gentlemen you have been imposed upon said the prisoner who was
entirely sober now when the subject was opened  an unparalleled outrage
has been perpetrated on me and i shall look to you gentlemen for heavy
damages for my character is not a thing to be trifled with 

     mr gaybroon we have proceeded with due caution and we are respon-
sible for our actions we shall look to your bondsmen for the fifty thousand
dollars of the citys funds you have appropriated to your own use replied
colonel brockway

     you have caused my arrest on the strength of a statement which appears
to be signed by the person who committed this robbery there is no other
evidence replied mr gaybroon who had certainly braced himself up a
good deal since his rations of whiskey had been stopped  no court will
receive that statement as evidence

     we do not propose to ask any court to receive it

     the boy who brings that paper here got into a quarrel with my son in
which i found it necessary to take a hand i dont know that clipper did
not write the statement himself  

    dont you know that it was subscribed and sworn to before a magis-
trate    demanded the chairman   but the statement is supported by the
return of twenty thousand dollars which the cashier sacredly preserved

     returned   gasped mr gaybroon from whom all the facts had been
carefully withheld

      can you tell how this package of money happened to be done up in a
handkerchief with the name of a gaybroon  written upon it  we pro-
pose to produce the handkerchief in court if we dont the statement

     this is a conspiracy to ruin me   groaned mr gaybroon

     the vault was not opened from the time you locked it till you came to
the office the next morning said mr bunse so excited that he could not
keep still any longer   i saw you at the trunk with the package of bills 
the floor at your side at least it was a package just the size of the bundle
i brought here yesterday and was done up in a white handkerchief

     this is a conspiracy   whined the culprit  do you suppose if i was
wicked enough to steal seventy thousand dollars i would throw away twenty
thousand dollars of it on such a man as benedict was 

      fortunately we have your own explanation to that paradox read his
confession mr clayton replied colonel brockway

dont i tell you that i could hold on to the fifty thousand dollars only
by fastening the robbery on the cashier   the officer read from his book

    with a heavy groan the ex-treasurer dropped into a chair he was com-
pletely overcome and possibly he wished he had drank less whiskey on the
day of his capture clayton read all he had written the robber realized
that he had  given himself away and that the case was sure to go against
him he was completely broken down he begged the officials to spare
him for his familys sake

     you did not spare the cashier for the sake of his family replied
colonel brockwav severely you drove him into the wilderness with his
wife and child you set a trap for him when you discovered the fact that


making a man of himself

he had taken a fifty dollar bill from tlie drawer for a day or two and had put
it back before you found it out  

   mr gaybroon was committed to jail ford fled from him and went
home the robber was so cast down that he made a full confession he
had felt sure that the cashier would be arrested and brought back and that
the discovery of the money in his trunk or wherever he put it would
convict him he gave up all his property and the fifty thousand dollars was
returned to the treasury whereat the taxes were greatly reduced and the
citizens rejoiced accordingly

   clifton benedict you have made the city of pinkingham seventy
thousand dollars better off than it would be without you or if you had not
been as honest as your father he stimulated you to make a man of your-
self and with the help of god you will do it said colonel brockway when
cliftons assistance was no longer needed last night the city council
voted to present to you one thousand dollars for your services a subscrip-
tion has been raised to remove the remains of your father and mother to the
cemetery aud erect a monument to the memory of your father on which they
propose to inscribe   an honest mans the noblest work of god 

     i thank you sir for all you have done and i feel that i have performed
the duty my father left for me to do i have been able with your help to
redeem his memory from a foul charge and i am satisfied replied clifton
  the other work he gave me to do that of making a man of myself i sup-
pose i shall not finish for a long time yet  

    you have made remarkably good progress in that direction young man
making a man of himself is a good thing for a boy to do  and i think it
would be well for all of you who have grown up to amend the legend by
adding a single word so that it will fit the case of every one-making a better
man of himself

     when i get old enough i will think to add that word and hold on to
the maxim as long as i live  

    one thing more clifton the present city treasurer wants a young man
in his office and the place is open to you it is that of messenger  and you
may yet be cashier as your father was before you and even treasurer for
the people remember those who serve them faithfully  

     i shall be very glad of the place in the fall sir answered clifton
you can take it as soon as you please and the salary voted by the
council is five hundred dollars a year   added colonel brockway

   mr bunse returned to smoker lake the young hunter followed his
calling as a guide during the rest of the season he and perry became fast
friends as indeed they had been from the first acquaintance tom and his
party had gone home before clifton arrived but he often met them at piuk-
ingham and mendoro

   stilt buckram was delighted to see the young hunter when he came back 
and it took the latter many hours to tell all that related to the robbery of
the bank and the return of the money

   you didnt tell me nothin about that money clippy said the old
hunter
a fair relation



    i didnt tell anybody about it till the paper was found by mr gay-
broon when you have a secret to keep stilt keep it yourself

   well i reckon thats right i always knowed that gaybroon was a
raskil  and it went agin me to give him back his pocketbook but your
good mother settled that and settled it right too  

    no one can afford to be anything but honest and upright stilt my
father made a little slip at the treasury and that is why he was timid all the
rest of his life do right if it is only for the pluck it will give you to do
your duty when it isnt easy to do it

    i reckon you are right clippy then you are going away to leave me
and i shall be all alone in the woods here in the winter added stilt sadly

      i shall have a vacation in the summer and i shall spend every minute of
it with you i give you everything up at the castle my boat and my guns
you can move up there if you like

    thank ye clippy  then you will feel at home when you visit me

   in the fall clifton went to pinkingham the chairman of the finance
committee found him an excellent boarding place with a widow lady he
entered upon the duties as messenger and assistant cashier and his fidelity
secured to him his reward in due time

   gaybroon was sent to the state prison for a long term aud he died within
the walls he had piled up his own ruin fordy went to the west with his
mother for she had friends there  but he never amounted to anything

   clifton benedict is over twenty one now and has added the single word to
the creed of his earlier life  but he still assures his friends that the chief
business of a boy is the duty of making a man of himself

                                                                 olivet optic

two railroad episodes

the spectacle that disquieted the heart of warren denslow--why he found atlantic city
dismal and sought an early escape thereby precipitating railroad episode number two

tt was very hot in the cars the train was a vestibuled one and the win-
dows of the drawing room coaches seemed to be hermetically sealed to
their frames denslow threw aside his afternoon paper and wheeled about
in his chair seeking an avenue of escape from the sense of suffocation that
was oppressing him

   he rose and began walking through the cars it had occurred to him
that possibly the swift movement of the train would suck some of the air
back on the last platform enough at any rate to cool him off for a moment or
two

   it was early in may denslow had just returned from a tvo years stay
in portland oregon starting there a branch of business for his father

     your aunt is in atlantic city the latter had told him when he met him
at the station  she is not well and has gone down there with her maid
she is very anxious to see you and i promised that i would suggest to you to
run over and star a few days before you settle down here  

   mrs roslyn had taken a mothers place to warren denslow when he was
six the young man felt that he owed her both affection and respect and so
he had set off in the  train the next afternoon

     the blytheways can hold over for a few days he told himself

   the winter before he had gone west he had met agnes blytheway at a
dance she had invited him to call and he had enjoyed the visits at her
house exceedingly the interruption of his friendship caused by his de-
parture for oregon was a source of deeper regret to him than he cared to
admit even to himself if he had known agues longer he might have asked
permission to correspond as it was he felt that their intimacy was only just
beginning when his absence came to break it off

   she may be out of town next week he was telling himself now and
at that very instant he caught sight of her in the rear coach which he had
just entered

   she was facing him but did not see him her eyes were fixed on a man
who sat in the adjoining chair and who was talking with her denslow was
compelled to step aside at this point for an instant a small child was walk-
ing down the aisle toward him its nurse close behind it as denslow waited
for the two to pass he overheard a womans voice just in front of him remark
to a companion  of course theyre bride and groom sadie

   the speaker was looking straight at agnes the train rounded a curve
just then denslow caught at the chair back to steady himself he won-
dered whether he would not have been obliged to do this if the curve had not
two railroad episodes



been there there was certainly a strange feeling at his heart he had not
realized till that moment how much he cared for agnes blytheway and
here she was married and he was on the same train in which she was taking
her bridal trip 

   but when the nurse aud child had passed him he kept straight on he
had started to reach the end of the train he was not going to turn back
simply because he found a girl whom he had known two years before was on
her honeymoon if she looked up he would stop and speak to her she
could not imagine that she had occupied a very deep place in his heart
she did not look up however her companion had just called her attention
to something out of the window denslow passed on and reached the little
gate at the extreme end of the train he stood here leaning against the
doorway watching the pebbles among the track ballast fly up and skurry
along after the speeding train for a few feet then fall down into a fresh rest-
ing place

   there was a slight breeze here denslow took off his traveling cap and
let it lift the hair from his damp forehead while he tried to dissociate the mad
rush of the train from the swiftness with which his own thoughts seemed
inclined to launch themselves into the future-a future too in which now
there seemed to be  destination as atlantic city was the destination of the
train

    of course theyre bride and groom he found himself almost uncon-
sciously echoing the words he had overheard that woman say what
business was it of hers anyway whether those two were newly wed or not 
denslow felt that he was growing unreasonably angry with the woman who
had opened his eyes to a fact he should have been glad to learn it might
have been awkward if he had gone to call at the blytheways just as of old
very likely agnes had forgotten him time had moved swiftly for her with
all the distractions of society while for him in a new atmosphere and with
new friends to make he had had vast opportunities to think over the past and
to look forward into the future till this minute denslow had not realized
what a very important factor in his future agnes blytheway had been what
if this were his own wedding journey  what if he had only stepped to the
rear end of the car to see if it was not cooler and were now going to return
and get camp chairs so that he and she might sit there together 

   but he found he dared not think on in this strain it would be better
he decided that he should not remain in the same car to be sure none of
the passengers could see him there was only the pantry connected with the
buffet behind him nevertheless he felt like an interloper and replacing his
cap he turned into the side passage and began to retrace his steps he could
see plainly the face of agnes companion now he appeared to be a man of
about thirty five and denslow did not remember ever to have met him he
hurried on into his own car and tried to pass the rest of the trip in sleep-
an attempt at which he made a conspicuous failure

   he was among the very first to leave the train when it ran into the station
at atlantic city he felt now that he wanted above all things to avoid meet-
ing face to face her who had been miss blytheway


two railroad episodes

    his aunt was rapturously glad to see him when he reached the hotel

   i am afraid you will find it very stupid here though warren she
added after her greeting  thei-es nobody around but invalided old ladies
and mutually absorbed brides and grooms

    denslows response was a declaration that he had come to atlantic city
expressly to see his aunt and that no other attractions were necessary the
old lady smiled and looked up at the tall handsome fellow with pride in her
eyes he had always been gallant even as a little chap she hoped he
would find a wife worthy of him some day

    the next afternoon mrs roslyn declared she felt well enough to go out
in her wheel chair for an airing on the board walk denslow offered to push
it for her but she said that she had a regular attendant hired by the week
and warren might walk along by her side

     well go down to the old whaler she said when they had started  it
is as good as a play to hear the tone in which the attendant explains things
the hurly burly of the summer season at the famous coast resort had not
yet commenced only a few of the booths along the board walk were open
there were quite a number of people out but they were not of the excursion
class

   the stranded whale ship was reached in due course mrs roslyn left
her chair and gave her arm to her nephew the youth who delivered the
lecture was even droller than denslow had expected to find him

   now warren said his aunt after they had been through the after
cabin ill sit here and i want you to go down into the forecastle where the
sailors sleep they tell me it is worse than a prison

    in his present state of mind denslow did not feel an interest in anything
but after lingering to be presented to a friend who had just come aboard and
who volunteered to stay with mrs roslyn he went forward and climbed
down into the steerage where two or three sightseers were already assembled
with the guide

    it was a dismal hole and denslow felt grimly that it was an appropriate
spot in which to meet agnes under the circumstances for here she was
standing beside the man who had been with her in the cars listening with
an only half suppressed smile to the droning tones of the  lecturer

     why mr denslow she exclaimed putting out her hand  i thought
i saw you in the train yesterday but i was not sure i imagined you were
still in oregon i am ever so glad to see you dick she added turning to
her companion permit me to present mr denslow-mr chester when
did you get back from the west 

    she was overwhelmingly charming cordial pretty-everything that goes
to make a woman attractive the two years that had intervened since
denslow had seen her last had served to crown with completeness the bud-
ding graces that had then only begun to captivate him he now felt himself
to be her slave a recklessness quite foreign to his nature took possession of
him she seemed heartily glad to see him even if she had married somebody
else he would show that he was just as glad he smiled down into her
eyes as he answered her question
two railroad episodes



      i got back two days ago i wish now that i had never gone  

   he wondered if she understood what he meant he thought she must
for even by the faint light that stole down the hatchway he could see the
color deepen slightly in her cheeks he looked around to see what impres-
sion his daring had made on mr chester but the latter had stepped over
to the side of the lecturer who had suddenly found himself with an audi-
ence quite inattentive to his remarks

    didnt you have a pleasant time 

   agnes looked down and began to draw invisible figures on the planking
with the tip of her parasol as she put the question

    no  i cant honestly say that i did i was thinking too much of other
times  

   denslow scarcely felt that it was himself who was speaking he was not
the sort of man who flirts but here he was hinting as broadly as he could to
a woman on her bridal tour that he was inconsolable because he had lost her
if they had been very old friends it would have been different she would
have laughed at his frankness and perhaps have told him that he was not
quick enough as it was she changed the subject now and asked 

      are you going to remain here long   

   where in this black hole of a place he replied wilfully misunder-
standing her  yes as long as its ugliness is redeemed by the sunshine of
a certain presence  

   this was positively going too far he told himself he wondered why
chester did not come over and pitch him into the hold just behind them he
did come back now to say agnes it is damp down here you had
better go up i think  

   he led the way out and the others followed

   at which hotel are you staying- denslow was about to add

mrs chester but his lips refused to frame the words he ended
abruptly but agnes turned and told him with a smile the windsor
and- 

    be careful agnes theres a step there

   chester interrupted her with this remark and her sentence remained
unfinished they had reached the main cabin by this time and denslows
aunt beckoned him to her side with a lifting of his hat and a  good after-
noon he parted from the woman who had stirred his pulses as he thought
they never could be stirred carried away by au impulse he could neither
explain nor condone he had allowed his admiration for her to make itself too
manifest to be mistaken and she well she certainly had not showed
that she disliked it

   denslows brain was in a whirl when they reached the hotel and he had
gone to his room to make himself ready for tea that he sober sided
warren as his friends had often called him should be carrying on a flirtation
with a married woman and a bride at that seemed to him an astounding
fact he must cut himself loose in some way he could not bring scandal
upon the family name he would return to new york the next morning
although he had promised to stay a day or two longer he could plead a


the man who leads

business contingency clearly atlantic city was a very unsafe place for him
at the present time

   he broke the news to mrs roslyn at the tea table

    i was afraid you would find it stupid here warren was her comment

   stupid  if she only knew the real reason for his going was denslows
reflection 

   the next day was even more beautiful than its predecessor denslow
decided to walk to his train in order to breathe in as much of the atlantic
ozone as possible before getting back to town as he neared the station he
saw agnes strolling up and down the platform with chester she was not in
traveling dress she had evidently come down to see him off it was
strange he should leave her if they were in their honeymoon denslow
thought perhaps though it occurred to him they had been married for
some time

   she smiled sweetly when she saw him coming but he imagined a cloud
came over her face when her eye fqjl on his valise which he stepped forward
to take from the omnibus driver

    are you going to leave so soon   she said

    yes i must get back to town at once he replied

   he knew that the answer was terribly commonplace but with those fasci-
nating ejes looking straight up into his all his ideas seemed frozen leaving
only one sensation behind that of bitter burning love

   im so sorry she said dick has to go back to that horrid busi-
ness too i was hoping that we might have a cavalier who could drop in and
see us now and then if we couldnt afford one in the house

   we denslow looked his perplexity

    yes lena and i shes my sister i think you never met her she
was south that winter why didnt you know i was staying with her and
her husband here  she was not well so she told dick to bring me back
with-but there is your train just starting

   she began waving her hand to chester who stood on the step calling out 

  remember to telegraph me at the first turn for the worst  

   denslow did not move he saw the cars rolling out from the station saw
agnes look of amazement as she turned to find him still beside her then

    its too bad   ive made you miss your train rattling on in this way
she said

    its no matter he answered calling to the bus driver to take his valise
 ive decided i wont go back to town today and they walked away from
the station together

the deed that cost john jeffreys months of misery-from pillar to post in quest of daily bread-
                       the remorseless fate that pursued a tarnished name

synopsis of chapters previously published

    while away at boarding school john jeffreys during a game of football accidentally in-
jures a boy so badly that his life is despaired of jeffreys thereupon runs away from bolsover
and returns to his guardian in york who turns him adrift with only a sovereign after informing
him that the money left for him by his father has been lost through an unfortunate speculation
after tramping the streets for some time and receiving several rebuffs jeffreys finally finds a
position as under teacher at galloway house a school for little boys conducted by mrs trimble
the boys take to him which is sufficient to arouse the ire of mrs trimbles surly first assistant
her son jonah who tracks jeffreys on one of his evening rambles and afterwards abstracts from
his pocket a letter speaking of young forrester the boy injured at school jeffreys is once more
cast on the cold charities of the world which throws him only one sop in the shape of julius his
guardians dog who has been left behind when mr halgrove moves away leaving not a trace
behind jeffreys tramps his way to grangerham where he can find out but little about for-
rester and then seeking refuge for the night in a tumble down shed overhears a plot to abduct
percy rimbolt the fourteen year old son of a wealthy family in the neighborhood with the
assistance of the dog julius he frustrates this and restores percy to his home

    mr rimbolt takes a fancy to jeffreys and appoints him to the post of private librarian at a
salary of a hundred pounds a year he gets on famously with percy and is treated with
marked favor by raby atherton percys cousin who is staying at wildtree during her fathers
absence in afghanistan with his regiment but mrs rimbolt dislikes the newcomer and neg-
lects no opportunity to humiliate him during the holidays mrs scarfe and her son arrive on
a visit and in the young man jeffreys recognizes a schoolmate at bolsover one fully cognizant
of the forrester affair they merely exchange civilities however and in one way or another
grate harshly on each other throughout the term of scarfes stay scarfa tries to prejudice raby
against jeffreys but she refuses to listen to tales of the librarian behind his back when he
goes away however scarfe writes an insulting letter to jeffreys giving him the opportunity to
tell the wildtree household about the forrester episode at bolsover before he scarfe sends
mr rimbolt a full account of it himself

chapter xxix--a link to old times

a s soon as he read it jeffreys pitched scarfes letter contemptuously into
the grate he was not much of a man of the world but he could read
through the lines of a poor performance like this

   scarfe for some reason or other did not like to tell the rimbolts himself
but he was most anxious they should know and desired jeffreys to do the
dirty work himself there was something almost amusing in the artlessness
of the suggestion and had the subject been less personally grievous jeffreys
could have afforded to scoff at the whole business

   he sat down on the impulse of the moment and dashed off the following
dear scarfe

would it not he a pity that yoursense of duty should not have the satisfaction of doing

its own work instead of begging me to do it for you  i may be all you say but i am not
mean enough to rob you of so priceless a jewel as the good conscience of a man who has
done his duty so i respectfully decline your invitation and am

                                                               yours

j jeffreys

   having relieved himself by writing it he tore the note up and tried to
forget all about it

   but that was not quite so easy scarfes part in the drama he could
forget but the question faced him not for the first time had he any right to
be here trusted and by some of the family even respected  was he not
sailing under false colors and pretending to be something he was not 

   true he had been originally engaged as librarian a post in which char-
acter was accounted of less importance than scholarship and general proficiency
but he was more than a librarian now circumstances had made him the
mentor and companion of a high spirited honest boy was it fair to percy
to keep a secret that would certainly shut the doors of wildtree against him
forever was it fair to mr rimboft to accept this new responsibility with-
out a word was it fair to raby who would shrink from him with detesta-
tion did she know the whole story 

   scarfe would have been amply satisfied had he been present to note the
disquietude which ensued for some days after the arrival of his letter
jeffreys felt uncomfortable in his intercourse with mr rimbolt he avoided
raby and even with percy he was often unaccountably reserved and
pensive

   one day finding himself alone with mr rimbolt in the library he
suddenly resolved then and there to speak out

   oh jeffreys began mr rimbolt i am very anxious to get those
books from the wanley abbey sale looked through and catalogued if you can
manage it we all go up to london you know next week and i should be
glad to have all square before we start

    i have no doubt they can all be gone through before then

   i should like you to come to town too said mr rimbolt percy
sets great store by your companionship besides which there are some very
important book sales coming on in which i shall want your help

   i had been going to ask you- began jeffreys feeling his temples
throbbing like two steam engines

   oh by the way interrupted mr rimbolt taking a letter from his
pocket   did not you tell me you were at a school called bolsover   

    yes faltered jeffreys wondering what was coming

   its very odd i have a letter from an old oxford acquaintance of
mine called frampton who appears to be head master there and whom i
have never heard of for about sixteen years he is fond of books and
writes to ask if he may come and see the library ive asked him to stay a
night and expect him here tomorrow i dare say you will be glad to meet
him perhaps he knows you are here  

    no i dont think so said jeffreys

    ah then i dare say you will be glad to see one another again

   jeffreys was considerably staggered by this unexpected announcement
living it down



but it relieved him of all present perplexity as to speaking to mr rimbolt of
young forrester he would at least wait till mr frampton came and put
himself in his hands

   mr frampton was taking a three days run in the lake country during a
term holiday and determined to do and see all he could had decided to
visit his old college friend and look over the now famous wildtree library

   his surprise at meeting jeffreys was very considerable and at first it
seemed to the quondam pupil that his old master was shy of him this how-
ever was explained as soon as they were alone and had to do with the seven
pounds which had burned holes in mr framptons pockets ever since lie
received them but which not knowing jeffreys address he had never been
able to return

     i was never more pained than when i received this money   said he
 your guardian was written to by the clerk in ordinary course but i never
imagined the bill would be passed  to you

   jeffreys had nothing for it but to take the money back much as he disliked
it until he did so mr frampton was too fidgety to be approachable on any
other subject

   the morning after his arrival they went up wild pike together the first
time jeffreys had been on the mountain since the death of julius they had
a fine day and  difficulty  but the long talk which beguiled the way amply
made up to jeffreys for the lack of adventure

   mr frampton told him much about bolsover and then began to ask him
about himself and got from him a full account of all that had befallen him
since he left school mr frampton was a most sympathetic listener and the
poor dog with a bad name who had almost forgotten the art of speaking
his mind full to any one warmed insensibly to his friend as they talked and
reproached himself for the pride and shortsightedness which had induced him
to shut himself out from his friendship

   then they talked of the school and of young forrester mr frampton
made no attempt to gloss over the wickedness of that unhappy act of passion
but he showed how fully he made allowance for the poor blundering offender
and how he at least saw more to pity than to upbraid in it all

   he knew nothing of young forresters fate he had seen in the papers
the notice of captain forresters death from whom months before he had had
a letter of inquiry as to his sons whereabouts and to whom he had written
telling all he knew which was but little

   then jeffreys unfolded his present uncomfortable dilemma and his inten-
tion of speaking to mr rimbolt and they talked it over very seriously and
anxiously at last mr frampton said 

    let me speak to mr rimbolt

    most thankfully i will

   so mr frampton spoke to mr rimbolt and told him frankly all there
was to tell and mr rimbolt like a gentleman who knew something of
christian charity joined his informant in pitying the offender

   jeffreys said he the day after mr framptons departure your
friend has told me a story about you which i heard with great sorrow you


living it down

are now doing all that an honest man can do with gods help to make up
for what is past what i have been told does not shake my present confi-
dence in you in any way and i need not tell you that not a single person in
this house beyond yourself and me shall know anything about this unhappy
affair  

chapter xxx-mrs rimbolt frees her mind

   jeffreys started for london with a lighter heart than he had known
since he first came to wildtree when he contrasted his present sense of
relief with the oppression which had preceded it he marveled how he could
ever have gone on so long dishonestly nursing his wretched secret under mr
rimbolts roof now in the first reaction of relief he was tempted to
believe his good name was really come back and that mr rimbolt having
condoned his offense the memory of bolsover was canceled

   the rimbolts house in clarges street was to jeffreys mind not nearly
so cheerful as wildtree the library in it consisted of a small collection of
books chiefly political for mr rimbolts use in parliamentary work and the
dark little room allotted to him with its lookout on the mews was dull indeed
compared with the chamber at wildtree from which he could at least see the
mountain

   nor did he by any means enjoy the constant round of entertainments
which went on in london at which he was sometimes called upon in a hum-
ble way to assist he had been obliged in deference to mrs rimbolts broad
hints to buy a dress suit and in this he was expected on occasions to present
himself at the end of a grand dinner party or when mr rimbolt required his
professional attendance

   for there being no books to take care of here mr rimbolt availed him-
self of his librarians services as a private secretary in some important political
business and found him so efficient and willing that he proposed to him a
considerable increase in salary in consideration of his permanently undertaking
a good share of his employers ordinary correspondence

   the chief portion of jeffreys time however still belonged to percy and it
was a decided relief to him that that young gentleman scoffed at and
eschewed the endless hospitalities and entertainments with which his mother
delighted to fill up their life in london

   on the day before scarfes proposed visit walker accosted him with the
announcement that my lady would like to speak with him in the morning
room

   this rare summons never failed to wring a groan from the depths of the
librarians spirit and it did now as he proceeded to the torture chamber

   the lady was alone and evidently burdened with the importance of the
occasion

    mr jeffreys said she with a tone of half conciliation which put up
jeffreys back far more than her usual severe drawl  kindly take a seat  
wish to speak to you

    its all up with me groaned jeffreys inwardly as he obeyed
living it down



    mrs rimbolt gathered herself together and began

    i desire to speak to you mr jeffreys in reference to my niece miss
atherton who in her fathers absence is here under my protection and
parental control

    jeffreys flushed up ominously

     it does not please me mr teffreys to find you occupying as you do the
position of a dependent in this house so far forgetting yourself as to consider
that there is anything in your respective positions which justifies you in
having communications with miss atherton other than those of a respectful
stranger  

    jeffreys found himself frivolously thinking this elaborate sentence would
make an interesting exercise iu parsing for the head class at galloway house
he barely took in that the remarks were intended for him at all and his
abstracted look apparently disconcerted mrs rimbolt

     i must request your attention mr jeffreys said she severely

     i beg your pardon i am all attention

    iam quite willing to suppose continued she  that it is ignorance on
your part rather than intentional misconduct which has led you into this but
from henceforth i wish it to be clearly understood that i shall expect you to
remember your proper station in this house miss atherton let me tell you
has no need of your attentions you perfectly understand me mr jeffreys 

    jeffreys bowed still rather abstractedly

     you do not reply to my question mr jeffreys

    i perfectly understand you madam

      i trust i shall not have to speak to yrou again  

     i trust not said jeffreys with a fervor which startled the lady

    he left the room outraged insulted sorely tempted to shake the dust of
the place once for all from off his feet the evil temper within him once
more asserted itself as he fhmg himself into his room slamming the door be-
hind him with a force that made the whole house vibrate

   the narrow room was insupportable it stifled him he must get out
into the fresh air or choke

   on the doorstep he met mr rimbolt who had just alighted from his
brougham

    oh jeffreys so glad to have caught you look here i fiud i must
be in the house tonight and tomorrow and i intended to go down to exeter
to attend that four days sale of lord waterfields library i must get you
to go for me you have the catalogue we went through together- with the
lots marked which i must have i have put an outside price against some
and the others must be mine at any price-you understand stick at nothing
take plenty of money with you for traveling and expenses do things com-
fortably and i will give you a blank check for the books

   the proposal came opportunely to jeffreys he was in the humor of
accepting anything for a change and this carte blanche proposal and the
responsibility it involved contained a spice of excitement which suited with
his present mood

    jeffreys prepared for his journey in a better mood


living it down

   he went down to exeter that night trying to think of nothing but lord
waterfields books and to forget all about raby and percy and mrs
rimbolt and scarfe

chapter xxxi-adrift again

   soon after jeffreys return business called mr rimbolt north for a few
days one afternoon soon after his departure while percy and raby were
out and jeffreys had shut himself up in mr rimbolts study to write a letter
was delivered by the postman addressed to mrs rimbolt and bearing the
oxford postmark it was from scarfe and mrs rimbolt opened her eyes as
she perused it

                                                  christchurch april nd

dear mrs rimbolt

    i reached here from home this morning and hasten to send you a line to thank you
for the very pleasant visit i spent in london last week i should have written sooner but
that i was anxious to write you on another and less pleasant subject which i felt should
not be done hurriedly you will i dare say blame me for not having told you earlier
what i now feel it my duty to tell and i trust you will understand the feelings which have
prevented my doing so john jeffreys who is in mr rimbolts employment is as you
know an old schoolfellow of mine i was surprised to see him at wildtree last christ-
mas and took the trouble to inquire whether he had come to you with a character or
whether you had any knowledge of his antecedents i imagined you had not and sup-
posed that as he was only engaged as a librarian inquiries as to his character were not con-
sidered necessary but when i saw that he was being admitted as a member of your
household and specially allowed to exercise an influence on percy i assure you i felt
uncomfortable and it has been on my mind ever since to tell you what i feel you ought to
know jeffreys ran away from school after committing a cruel act which to all intents
and purposes was murder his victim was a small boy whom we all loved and who
never did him harm the details of the whole affair are too horrible to dwell upon here
but i have said enough to show you what sort of person it is who is at present intrusted
with the care of your own son and allowed to associate on a footing of equality with your
niece miss atherton i assure you it is very painful to me to write this for i know how
it will shock you but i feel my conscience would not give me peace till i told you all
may i now ask one special favor from you  it is well known and you probably have
noticed it yourself that jeffreys and i naturally dislike one another but i want you to
believe that i write this not because i dislike jeffreys but because i like you all and feel
that percy particularly is in peril what i ask is that if you think it right to take any
action in the matter my name may not be mentioned it would be considered an act of
spite on my part which it is not and perhaps i may mention to you that i have special
reasons for wishing that miss atherton at least should not think worse of me than i
deserve she would certainly misunderstand it if my name were mentioned i feel i
have only done my duty and i assure you it will be a great relief to me to know that you
are rid of one who cannot fail to exercise a fatal influence on the pure and honest mind of
my friend percy

   believe me dear mrs rimbolt most sincerely yours	e scarfe

   the shock which this astounding communication gave to mrs rimbolt
can be more easily imagined than described it explained everything-her
instinctive dislike of the fellow from the first his moroseness and insolence
and the cunning with which he had insinuated himself first into her husbands
and then into percys confidence  how blind she had been not to see it all
before  she might have known that he was a villian  now however her
duty was clear and she would be wicked if she delayed to act upon it a
living it down

ii

moment if mr rimbolt had been at home it would have fallen on him
to discharge it but he was not and she must do it for him

   whereupon this worthy matron girded herself for the fray and stalked off
tio the study

   jeffreys was busy transcribing some bibliographical notes which he had
brought away with him from exeter the work was not very engrossing
and he had leisure now and then to let his mind wander and the direction his
thoughts took was towards mr rimbolts little plan of a run on the continent
for percy and himself the coming summer jeffreys had been afraid to
acknowledge to himself how much the plan delighted him he longed to see
the everlasting snows and the lakes and the grand old mediaeval cities and
the prospect of seeing them with percy away from all that could annoy or
jar him

   he had got so far when the door opened and mrs rimbolt stood before
him

   the lady was pale and evidently agitated beyond her wont she stood
for a moment facing jeffreys and apparently waiting for words the
librarians back went up in anticipation if it was more about raby he
would leave the room before he forgot himself

    mr jeffreys said the lady and her words came slowly and hoarsely
 i request you to leave this house in half an hour

    it was jeffreys turn to start and grow pale

      may i ask why   he said

    you know why sir said the lady  you have known why ever since
you had the meanness to enter wildtree on false pretenses  

   really mrs rimbolt began jeffreys with a cold shudder passing
through him  i am at a loss-

    dont speak to me sir you knew you had no right to enter the house
of honest respectable people-you knew you had no right to take advantage
of an accident to insinuate yourself into this family and impose upon the un-
suspecting good nature of my husband no one asked you for your charac-
ter for no one imagined you could be quite so hypocritical as you have been
you the self constituted friend and protector of my precious boy-you with
the stain of blood on your hands and the mark of cain on your forehead 
leave my house at once i desire no words you once talked about claim-
ing to be protected from insult in this house it is we who claim to be pro-
tected from a hypocrite and a murderer  begone and consider yourself
fortunate that instead of walking out a free man you are not taken out to
the punishment you deserve

   when jeffreys stunned and stupefied looked up the room was empty

   mechanically he finished a sentence he had been writing then letting the
pen drop from his hand sat where he was numbed body and soul mrs
rimbolts words dinned in his ears and with them came those old haunting
sounds the yells on the bolsover meadows the midnight shriek of the terri-
fied boy the cold sneer of his guardian the brutal laugh of jonah trimble
all came back in one confused hideous chorus yelling to him that his bad
name was still alive dogging him down down mocking his foolish dreams of

      l


living it down

deliverance and hope hounding him out into the night to hide his head in-
deed but never to hide himself from himself

   how long he sat there he knew not when he rose he was at least calm
and resolved

   he went up to his own room and looked through his little stock of posses-
sions the old suit in which he had come to wildtree was there and an
impulse seized him to put it on in exchange for the trim garments he was
wearing of his other goods and chattels he took a few special favorites
his homer-julius collar-a cricket cap-a pocket compass which percy had
given him and an envelope which raby had once directed to him for her
uncle his money-his last quarters salary-he took too and his old stick
which he had cut in the lanes near ash cottage that was all then
quietly descending the deserted stairs and looking neither to the right hand
nor the left he crossed the hall and opened the front door

   a pang shot through him as he did so was he never to see percy again
or her  what would they think of him 

   the thought maddened him and as he stood in the street he seemed to
hear their voices too in the awful clamor and rushed blindly forth anywhere
to escape it

chapter xxxii-in the depths

   a chiee october squall was whistling through the trees in regents park
stirring up the fallen leaves on the foot paths and making the nurse maids
as they listlessly trundled their perambulators shiver suddenly and think of
the nursery fire and the singing kettle on the hob the gathering clouds
above seiit the park keeper off to his shed for a waterproof and emptied the
carriage drive of the vehicles in which a few people were taking an afternoon
airing

   a little knot of small boys intently playing football with piled up jackets
for goals were the last to take alarm at the lowering sky nor was it till the
big drops fell in their midst that they scattered right and left and left the
park empty

   no not quite empty one young man sat on through the rain on the
seat from which he had been watching the boys game a shabby almost
ragged young man with a disagreeable face and an almost contemptuous
curl of the lip as the rain gathering force every second buffeted him in the
face and drenched him where he sat there were a hundred seats more
sheltered than that on which he sat and by walking scarcely fifty yards he
could have escaped the rain altogether but he sat recklessly on and let the
rain do its worst his eyes still on the empty football field and his ears ring-
ing still with the merry shouts of the departing boys

   my reader had he chanced to pass down that deserted walk on that
stormy afternoon would hardly have recognized in the lonely occupant of
that seat the john jeffreys he had seen six months ago at clarges street it
was not merely that he looked haggard and ill or that his clothes were
ragged that was bad enough but the reader has seen him in such a plight
                                                      

living it down	

before but what he has not seen before-or if at all only in passing
moments-is the bitter hard look on his face changing it miserably a
stranger passing him that afternoon would have said 

    there sits a man who hates all the world

   we who know him better would have said

    there sits our poor dog with a bad name deserted even by hope  

    and so it was

    jeffreys had left clarges street smarting under a sense of injury but still
resolved to keep tip the fight for his good name in which for so many months
past he had been engaged

   not by appealing to mr rimbolt although he knew had mr rimbolt
been at home all this would not have happened his pride forbade him now
to take a single step to reinstate himself in a house from which he had been
so ignominiously expelled no not even when that house held within its
walls percy and raby the idea of going back filled him with horror

   on the contrary he would hide himself from them even though they
sought to find him and not till his name was as good as theirs would he see
them again or come near them

   so thought poor jeffreys as he slowly turned his back on all that was dear
to him in life and went out into the night of the unsympathetic city

   at first as i said he tried to hold up his head he inquired in one or
two quarters for work but the question always came up

      what is your character   

      i have none   he would say doggedly

      why did you leave your last place   

    i was turned away

   what for

    because i am supposed to have killed a boy once

   once indeed he did get a temporary job at a warehouse-as a porter-and
for a week a happy week used his broad back and brawny arms in carrying
heavy loads and lifting weights hope sprang again within him as he labored
he might yet by beginning at the lowest step rise above his evil name and
conquer it

   alas  one day a shilling was lost from the warehousemans desk
jeffreys had been seen near the place and was suspected he resented the
charge scornfully at first then savagely and in an outbreak of rage struck
his accuser he was impeached before the head of the firm and it was dis-
covered that he had come without a character that wasenough he was
bundled out of the place at five minutes notice with a threat of a policeman
if he made it six and even when a week later the shilling was found in the
warehousemans blotting paper no one doubted that the cashiered rogue was
as cunning as he was nefarious

   after that he had given up what seemed the farce of holding up his head
what was the use he said when as sure as night follows day that bad name
of his dogged him wherever he went 

   so jeffreys began to go down in after years he spoke very little of those
six months in london and when he did it was about people he had met and


living it down

not about himself what he did where he lodged how he lived these were
matters that he never mentioned and never liked to be asked about

   i am quite sure myself that the reason of this silence was not shame he
was not one of those fellows who revenge themselves on fate by deliberately
going to the bad at his worst he had no taste for vice nor any affinity for
it he may have sunk low not because he himself was low but because in
his miserable feud with all the world he scorned not to share the lot of others
as miserable as himself

   his money-he had a few pounds when he left clarges street-soon failed
him he made no great efforts to keep it and was relieved to see the end
of it his companions in misery soon helped him away with it and he let
them

   but when it was gone the old necessity for work came back by day he
hardly ever ventured out of his court for fear of being seen by some one who
would attempt to rescue him from his present condition at night he wan-
dered restlessly about in the narrow streets picking up an early morning job
at covent garden market or in the omnibus stables

   he moved his lodgings incessantly one week inhabiting a garret in west-
minster another sharing a common room in whitechapel another doing
without lodgings altogether he spoke little or not at all to his fellow mis-
erables not because he despised them but because they fought shy of him
they disliked his superior ways and his ill concealed disgust of their habits
and vices they could have forgiven him for being a criminal in hiding that
they were used to but a man who spoke like a gentleman who took no
pleasure in their low sports and sat dumb while they talked loud and broad
seemed to them an interloper and an intruder

   once-it was about the beginning of august-in a lodging house across
the river he met a young fellow to whom for a day or two he felt drawn
his story was a sad one his father had beefn a gentleman and the boy had
been brought up in luxury and virtue while at school his father had died
and before he had left school his mother had been married again to a brute
who not only broke her heart but after setting himself to corrupt his step-
son had at last turned him adrift without a penny in the world the lad
with no strong principle to uphold him had sunk deep in vice yet there
lurked about him occasional flashes of something better

    after all he would say to jeffreys as the two lay at night almost 
bare boards whats the odds i maybe miserable one day but im jolly
the next now you seem to prefer to be uniformly miserable  

    hardly a case of preference said jeffreys   but im not sure that it
wouldnt be more miserable to be jolly

   try it youd give a lot to forget all about everything for an hour
wouldnt you  

      it would be pleasant  

    you can do it

      by dropping asleep   

    sleep  thats the time im most miserable i remember the old days
then and my mother and-i say jeffreys i was once nearly drowned at
living it down



eton just as i was going down for the last time i put up my hand and a
fellow saw it and came in and fished me out what a born fool i was to do
it i was grateful to the fellow at the time i hate him now  

   and the poor fellow with all the manhood out of him cried himself to
sleep  and jeffreys in mercy said not a word to stop him

   a pitiful sort of friendship sprang up between the two-the bitter strong
one and the vicious weak one it kept a soft corner in jeffreys heart to find
some one who held to him even in this degradation and to the poor prodigal
it was worth anything to have some one to talk to

   coming home one wet morning from one of his nocturnal expeditions
jeffreys found his fellow lodger up with a bottle in his hands

    my boy my boy cried the lad youre in luck and just in time
who says im lost to all decency after this why i might have hidden it
away when i heard you coming up no theres something of the noble-
man left iu me yet half of this is yours jeffreys only help yourself
quickly man or i may repent

   he held out the bottle tremblingly and with a wince that spoke volumes
    take it i never went halves before and perhaps i never shall again
   jeffreys took the bottle it was brandy

    half a tumbler of that jeffreys will make another man of you it
will send yon into dreamland youll forget there is such a thing as misery
in the world dont be squeamish old fellow youre cold and weak you
know you are you ought to take it youre not too good surely-eh
man alive if you never do anything worse than take a drop of brandy youll
pass muster come i say youre keeping me waiting

    jeffreys sank on a chair and raised the bottle half way to his lips

   what was it as he did so which flashed before his eyes and caused him
suddenly to set it down and rise to his feet 

   nothing real it is true yet nothing new just a momentary glimpse of
a boys pale face somewhere in the dim gloom of that little room and then
all was as before yet to jeffreys the whole world was suddenly altered

   he set the bottle down and neither heeding nor hearing the expostula-
tions of his companion he left the house never to return

chapter xxxiii-a strange rescue

   that night jeffreys slept in another part of the town and the poor
bewildered prodigal deserted by his only friend cried half the night through
and cursed again the boy who had once saved his life

    jeffreys hidden in another part of the great city sank to a lower depth of
misery than ever to him it seemed now that his bad name had taken form in
the face of young forrester and was dogging him in adversity more relent-
lessly even than in prosperity it comforted him not at all to think it had
saved him from a drunkards ruin he despised himself when he came to
himself for having been scared so weakly yet he avoided his old quarters and
turned his back  the one friend he had rather than face his evil genius
again


living it down

   he half envied his new fellow lodgers four of them at least stood a
chance of being hanged yet they managed to shake off all care and live
merrily

   come old gallus said one young fellow perk up youre safe
enough here dont be down were all in the same boat save up them
long faces for eight oclock in the morning at the police court dont spoil
our fun

   it was half pathetic this appeal and jeffreys for a day tried to be cheer-
ful but he could not do it and considerately went somewhere else

   how long was it to go on a time came when he could get no work and
starvation stared him in the face but a dying boy bequeathed him a loaf
and once again he was doomed to live

   but a loaf and the proceeds of a weeks odd jobs came to an end and now
once more as he sits in the rain in regents park he faces something more
than the weather he has not tasted food for two whole days and for all he
knows may never taste it again

   so he sits there with his eyes still on the football ground and his ears
ringing still with the merry shouts of the departed boys

   the scene changes as he stays on it is a football field still but not the
brown patch in a london park there are high trees throwing shadows
across the green turf and in the distance an old red school house and the
boys are no longer the lively london urchins their faces are familiar and
the names they call each other he knows nor is the game the same it
like the london boys game has ended suddenly but not in a helter skelter
stampede in the rain no it is a silent awe struck group round something
on the ground  and as he jeffreys elbows his way among them he sees
again a bojs face lying there pallid and perhaps lifeless then instinctively
he lifts his hands to his ears for a howl rises on all sides which deafens
him stuns him

   after all it is only the last effort of the october squall in regents park
buffeting him with a fusillade of rain and withered leaves he takes his
hands from his ears and with a sigh gets up and walks away he cares not
whither

   his steps lead him round the park and into the long avenue the rain
and the wind are dying down and alreach a few wayfarers surprised by the
sudden storm are emerging from their shelters aud speeding home

   the park keeper boldly parades the path in his waterproof as if he had
braved the elements since daybreak and there coming to meet him
sheltered under one umbrella are two who perhaps have no grudge against
the storm for detaining them in their walk that afternoon

   it is long since jeffreys has seen anything to remind him of the world he
has left but there is something about these two as they advance towards him
their faces hidden by the umbrella which attracts him the youth is slim
and well dressed and holds himself well his companions figure reminds him
of a form he knew-can it be only six months ago -light gentle cour-
ageous beside which he has walked in the wildtree park and on the london
pavements
living it down



   they meet-the tramp and the young couple they never heed him
how should they  but a turn of the umbrella gives him a momentary
glimpse of them and in that glimpse poor hapless jeffreys recognizes raby

and scarfe 

    surely this blow was not needed to crush him completely

   how long he stood statue-like looking down the path by which they had
gone neither he nor any one else could tell but it was dark when he was
roused by a harsh voice in front of him

     come sheer off young fellow its time you was out of the park 

     yes ill go said he and walked slowly to the gate

   he could not quit the park but wandered round and round it outside its
inhospitable palings covering mile after mile of wet pavement heedless of
the now drenching rain heedless of his hunger heedless of his failing
limbs

   the noisy street had grown silent and a clock near at hand had struck
two when he found himself on the little bridge whjch crosses the neighboring
canal it was too dark to see the water below but he heard the hard rain
hissing  its surface

   he had stood there before in happier days and wondered how men and
women could choose as they sometimes did to end their misery in that nar-
row streak of sluggish water

   he wondered less now not that he felt tempted to follow them  in his
lowest depths of misery that door of escape had never allured him yet as he
stood he felt fascinated and even soothed by the ceaseless noise of the rain
 the invisible water beneath it seemed almost like the voice of a friend
far away

   he had been listening for some time crouching in a dark corner of the
parapet when he became aware of footsteps approaching

   imagining at first they were those of a policeman coming to dislodge
the tramp from his lurking place he prepared to get up and move on but
listening again he remained where he was

   the footsteps were not those of a policeman they approached fitfully
now quickly now slowly now stopping still for a moment or two yet they
were too agitated for those of a drunkard and too uncertain for those of a
fugitive from justice

    as they drew near to the bridge they stopped once more and jeffreys peer-
ing through the darkness saw a form clutching the railings and looking
down in the water then a voice groaned  oh my god   and the foot-
steps hurried on

    jeffreys had seen misery in many forms go past him before but something
impelled him now to rise and follow the footsteps of this wanderer

   the splashing rain drowned every sound and it was with difficulty that
jeffreys weak and weary as he was could keep pace with the figure flitting
before him for after that glance over the bridge the fugitive no longer halted
in his pace but went on rapidly

   across the bridge he turned and followed the high banks of the canal
then he halted apparently looking for a way down it was a long impatient


living it down

search but at last jeffreys saw him descend along some railings which sloped
down the steep grass slope almost to the towing path

   jeffreys followed with difficulty and when at last he stood on the towing
path the fugitive was not to be seen nor was it possible to say whether he had
turned right or left

    jeffreys turned to the right and anxiously scanning both the bank and the
water tramped along the muddy path

   a few yards down he came upon a heap of stones piled up across the path
any one clambering across this must have made noise enough to be heard
twenty yards away and as far as he could judge in the darkness no one
had stepped upon it he then turned back hurriedly and retraced his steps

   the sullen water hissing still under the heavy rain gave no sign as he
ran along its edge and scanned it with anxious eyes

   the high bank on its left beyond the palings became inaccessible from
below the wanderer must therefore be before him on the path

   for five minutes he ran on straining his eyes and ears when suddenly he
stumbled it was a hat upon the path

   in a moment jeffreys dived into the cold water as he came to the sur-
face and looked round there was nothing but the spreading circles of his own
plunge to be seen but a moment afterwards close to the bank he had a
glimpse of something black rising for an instant and then disappearing
three strokes brought him to the spot just as the object rose again

   to seize it and strike out for the bank was the work of a moment the
man for it was he was alive and as jeffreys slowly drew him from the water
he opened his eyes and made a faint resistance

     let me go   he said with an oatli  let me go  

   but his head fell heavily on his rescuers shoulder while he spoke and
when at last he lay on the path he was senseless

    jeffreys carried him to the shelter of an arch and there did what he could
to restore animation it was too dark to see the mans face but he could
feel his pulse still beating and presently he gave a sigh and moved his head
 what did you do it for  he said piteously

   jeffreys started he knew the voice hoarse and choked as it was

    whats your name  he said raising the form in his arms and trying
to see the face  who are you  

    ive got no name why couldnt you let me be 

    isnt your name trimble-jonah trimble 

    the poor fellow lifted his head with a little shriek

    oh dont give me up  dont have me taken up  help me  

     i will help you all i can trimble

    why you know me then-youre-who are you 

    im john jeffreys

chapter xxxiv-an angel unawares

   in a wretched garret of a house in store alley near fuston at the sick
bed of his old enemy jeffreys reached a turning point in his life
living it down



   how he conveyed the half drowned jonah on the night of the rescue from
the canal bank to his lodgings he scarcely knew

   the hand of a friend is often near when it is least expected so jonah
had found when he believed all hope and life to be gone  and so jeffreys had
found when with his poor burden in his arms he met beside a barge at day-
break a dealer in vegetables for whom he had sometimes worked at covent
garden and who now like a good samaritan not only gave the two a lift in
his cart but provided jeffreys with an opportunity of earning a shilling

   this shilling worked marvels for both trimble and jeffreys were on the
point of starvat ion  and without food that night rescue would have been but
a farce

    it was soon evident that jonah had far more the matter with him than the
mere effects of his immersion he was a wreck body and soul the dis-
pensary doctor who called to see him gave him a fortnight to live aud the one
or two brave souls who penetrated on errands of mercy even into storr alley
marked his hollow cough and sunken cheeks and knew that before long one
name more would drop out of their lists

   it was slowly and in fragments only that jeffreys heard his story
jonah was forever reproaching him with what had happened on the canal
bank

   why couldnt you have left a fellow alone i know you wanted to
gloat over me go on be as happy as you like kujoy your revenge i
did you a bad turn now youve done me one so were qtiits

    here a fit of coughing would shake the breath out of the sufferer and it
would be a minute or two before he could proceed

   jeffreys wisely avoided all expostulations or self excuse he smoothed
the poor fellows pillow and supported him in his arms until the cough was
over and he could proceed

    it wras a bad day you ever came to our school john-jonah had
adopted the name by which jeffreys was known in storr alley-i hated you
the first time i saw you youve got the laugh on your side now but i can
tell you you wouldnt have had it then if you knew the way i followed you
up yes -and here came a shadow of his old sinister smile- i made it
all fit in like a puzzle did you never miss a letter you had that day you
called at the york post office-a letter about the dead burying their dead and
young forrester-oh yes you may start i know all about it i took that
letter out of your pocket and i know where ou buried his body do you
suppose i didnt see you throw yourself on the very place and say  it was
here   you held your nose in the air didnt you in the school  and palmed
yourself off on freddy and teddy rosher for a model but i bowled you
out i showed you up that was the day of my laugh now youve got
yours  

   the cough again stopped him aud when he recovered his breath jeffreys
said quietly 

    dont talk jonah you bring on your cough let me read to you

   then for the remainder of that day the story would rest till later on
jonah would abruptly return to it


living it down

    mother believed in you and cried a whole day after you had gone
yes and joull be glad to hear the school broke up all to pieces farmer
rosher took away his boys and spread a report about us and at the end of a
month we scarcely had a dozen left mother and i lived like cat and dog i
struck work and she had to do everything and it broke her up it would
never have happened if you hadnt come into the place i couldnt live there
any longer mother had a little bit saved fifty pounds or so and one night
after we had had a terrible row i took every penny of it out of her monej
box and came up to london now are you pleased  hadnt she something
to bless you for i say john get us some water quick im parched

    on another day jeffreys heard the rest

     i came up to london but it wasnt the fun i expected everybody i
met i thought was a detective  and all night long i dreamed of  mother
i tried to drown it and lived as wild a life as ou like till my money was
done then it would have been worth your while to see me everybody
was against me fellows id stood treat to kicked me out into the street and
fellows who owed me money laughed in my face i thought id go back to
york after all and get mother to take me back  but i couldnt face it

    thats all i stood it as long as i could i pawmed everything and
when that was done i stole-and got three months  the treadmill how
do you like that  when i got out a city missionary heard of me and found
me a job  but i stole again and ran away you wouldnt have thought i had
it in me at york would you i was a respectable young fellow there but
it was all there  and it was you brought it all out last week i made up my
mind to put an end to it all it took me a struggle to face it  but i was
settled to do it-and then as if you hadnt done enough harm you come and
spoil my last chance  

     not your last chance jonah

     no ive a week more to live then youll be rid of me

    he lingered day after day and it was absolutely necessary for jeffreys to
go and seek work in order to keep even that wretched roof above their heads

    one evening when he returned with a few coppers jonah met him with a
face brighter than any that he had yet seen

     ive had some one here today a better sort than yon one thats got
a right to talk about whats better a lady john or else an angel did
jyou send her   

   i no i know no ladies

     i dont know how it was i could tell her anything-and i say john it
would make you cry to hear her voice it did me you never made me cry
or saw me  i hate to hear you preach  but she-why she doesnt preach at
all but she says all youve got to say a hundred times better

    he was excited and feverish that night and in his sleep murmured scraps
of the gentle talk of this ministering angel which even from his lips fell with
a reflected sweetness on the trouble tossed spirit of the watcher

    jeffreys had succeeded in getting a temporary job which took him away
during the next two days but each night on his return he found his invalid
brighter and softened in spirit by reason of his angels visit
a twentieth century detective



   shell come tomorrow john youve been kind to me john and given
up a lot for me but if you were to hear her-

   here the dying youth could get no farther

   he seemed much the same in the morning when jeffreys started for work
the last words he said to his friend as he departed were 

    shes coming again today

   when jeffreys came home iu the evening the garret was silent and on the
bed lay all that remained on earth of jonah trimble

    as he stood over the lifeless body his eyes fell on a scrap of paper lying on
the pillow jeffreys caught it eagerly and read in a turmoil of agitation 

    your friend was not alone wlien he died peacefully this afternoon he left a mes-
sage for you  tell him he was right when he told me i had a chance if it had not -
been for him i should have lost it he also said  some day he may see mother and
tell her about me tell her i died better than i lived dear friend whose name i do
not know dont lose heart god is merciful and will be your friend when every one else
is taken from you

   it was not the words of this touching little message from the dead which
brought a gasp to jeffreys throat the writing hasty and agitated as it was
was a hand he had seen before it was rabys writing

a twentieth century detective

why bond  co saw fit to employ john smith on short notice-a bank robbery that was dis-
covered under rather surprising circumstances and which develops astounding features

t was the confidential clerk of the firm of bond  co bankers and dealers
in securities on a cold stormy morning in december mr bond
the senior member of the firm was an hour late in reaching the bank sev-
eral customers were in the reception room waiting to see him but following
his usual custom he went direct to his private office to look over his mail i
was waiting for him when he came in and had his letters all arranged on his
desk

   the banker had just taken his seat and picked up the letter lying on top
of the pile when there was a rap at the door i opened it and one of the
junior clerks handed a card tome

   the gentleman says he must see mr bond at once as his business is
important and will admit of no delay   said the clerk while he was speak-
ing i glanced at the card and read

                        john smith

detective

    what is it  asked the banker who had overheard the message deliv-
ered by the clerk

   i gave the card to him and glancing at it he repeated the name aloud

    i never heard of the man what is he like fred mr bond asked
turning to the clerk who had brought the card

     middle age well dressed looks like a detective   replied the clerk


a twentieth century detective

      show him in i will see what he wants  

   a few moments later john smith detective entered the room with the
manner of a man of business who has no time to waste

   with a pleasant good morning to the head of the firm and a curt nod in
my direction the detective placed his hat and gloves on a table and proceeded
to talk business without delay

    i called to see you about the robbery mr bond i have never had the
pleasure of doing any business with your firm but you have possibly heard
of my work in the wills forgery case and my references will satisfy you of
my standing in the profession my specialty is criminal work and having
been in the business for twenty years i flatter myself that i am familiar with
the faces and the methods of all the dangerous crooks in the country this
seems to have been a very clever job but i believe that i can put my hand
 the man who planned it and if we can agree on terms i am confident that
i can recover your property within forty eight hours i take it that you are
anxious to get back the securities without publicity

   by the time the detective had finished mr bond was facing him with an
expression of surprise and anger mingled

    what are you talking about sir there has been  robbery here i
do not understand you said the banker

    you have not been robbed that is strange then what is the mean-
ing of this 

   as the detective spoke he handed to the banker a slip of paper it was a
  personal   advertisement from a morning newspaper and read 

    if b- co of -street wish to negotiate for the return of securities they can

communicate with present holders by addressing through this column x y z

   mr bond read the advertisement over several times and then turning to
his visitor he said sharply   this is a hoax we have lost no securities

    then i am sorry to have troubled you and the detective turned as if
to go   but are you quite sure that you have not been robbed   he
waited to add there are some professional bank thieves in the city have
you looked through the contents of your safe this morning

   something in the tone of the man as he asked this question caused me to
glance at him sharply i saw that while he was apparently looking at the
banker he was furtively searching every nook and corner of the room with
his eyes

   the question for a moment startled mr bond and he turned toward the
big steel safe then he walked over and tried the handles to make sure that
it had not been opened

   no we have not been robbed he said our bank could not be
entered easily and it would take considerable time for even an expert cracks-
man to get in to one of the safes

   we had two large safes one in the main office for the cash and books the
other in the private office of the head of the firm in the latter were kept
stocks bonds mortgages and private papers only members of the firm
knew the combination of this safe

   john smith apologized for his visit gave his address and rattled off a
a twentieth century detective



long list of references while putting  his gloves then he suddenly
stopped short in his preparations for departure and turning to mr bond said 
 really sir this matter puzzles me it seems a strange sort of joke this
advertisement stippose you open your safe and make sure that you have
not lost any securities   

   the banker looked a trifle surprised but he turned towards the safe with-
out a word

   one moment mr bond if you will pardon me said smith as he
again removed his gloves you said just now that an entrance to your
bank could not be easily effected it is a good plan for you bankers not to
undervalue the cunning and daring of some of the thieves who are now at
large in the city it is a part of my business to be a close observer and i
notice that the top of your safe is visible from the street through a glass
window that has no shade here is a door at the rear of your office

   as the detective spoke he walked across the room and opened the door
which happened to be unlocked

    ah  i see this opens into a lumber room little used evidently here
is another door opens out of the lumber room into a narrow dark hall that
leads to the main corridor and the elevators  

   the detective was exploring the exit as he talked and the banker and i
were following close behind him too much surprised to protest

   front and cellar doors of the building are well secured at night of
course robbers could not get in that way ah what have we here

   the detective was looking through a small window into the light shaft and
we were close behind him

    narrow court extending back from the light and air shaft to an alley
fire escape ladder within easy reach of this window  extends all the way to
the ground no patent catch  the window can be opened from the out-
side no watchman in the alley probably  easy to reach the fire escape
ladder from that direction  climb up force the sash with a window jimmy
a short leap and there you are inside the building eh mr bond  here
what is this finger marks on the panes of glass four marks on the glass
one on the wooden sash just the way a man would catch hold of the window
to push it up or pull it down never be too sure that a robber cannot find a

way to get into your house why in the stonington burglary case- 

     do you think some one has broken into the building    mr bond sud-
denly asked with a show of nervousness

    i cannot say but as i have shown you it is evident that they could
 well if they broke in here they would still have to force two doors to
get into the bank

   john smith detective laughed aloud

    why my dear sir a burglar who would break down a door is a mere
bungling amateur skeleton keys and steel wires solve the problem now
let us have a look at your safe

   the three of us returned to the private office of the head of the firm and
the detective dropping on one knee in front of the safe made a hasty exant-
ination of the door then he turned to the banker with a grave face


a twentieth century detective

    mr bond i am afraid your safe has been tampered with the banker
looked at him with a smile of doubt

    you see continued the detective  the skilful bank burglar of today
does not break a safe he is too good a mechanic for that by placing a
short ear tube with the sharp edges of the steel bulb over the mechanism of
the lock the trained ear of the expert soon detects the combination as it is
revealed by the faint clicking souud made by turning the knob he can then
uulock the safe secure his booty and locking it again leave scarcely
a trace of his work on the outside if you look closely you will see
just to the right of the knob some faint marks on the door they may have
been made by the slipping of the steel bulb or cup of the ear tube while the
robber was locating the combination wheel of the lock

   the banker looked at the door of the safe and when he saw the marks
described his face turned pale with trembling fingers he caught hold of the
knob and began to unlock the safe while john smith stood by with a smile of
satisfaction on his face

   iu a few moments the heavy steel doors swung open and mr bond drew
forth three small boxes which i knew contained bonds stocks and other
securities of great value he hurriedly examined the contents of the first
box and found them correct but his excitement increased as he turned to the
second this box contained a greater number of papers and it took several
minutes to examine all of them the detective stood at the bankers side an
interested spectator of the search while i watched the proceedings from the
other side of the table	

   the search of the second box completed the detective took up the third
one and poured the contents in a heap on the table in front of the banker
in placing the empty box to one side his hands passed over the pile of papers
mr bond was quite pale and nervous by this time and seemed to forget the
presence of the stranger in a few moments he uttered an exclamation of
surprise and alarm and at once began to go through the mass again

   by the time he had completed the second search i saw that big drops of
perspiration were standing on his face

      they are gone   he cried out at last

    something of value  asked the detective in a quiet tone

    yes bonds worth  in the market they were deposited by a
customer two days ago  

    then the advertisement is not a joke

   the other members of the firm were called in and the contents of the safe
were again carefully gone over there was no mistake a package of bonds
was missing while the bank people with pale and anxious faces discussed
the robbery the detective stood a little distance away looking quite uncon-
cerned but apparently awaiting orders

   after the first excitement of the discovery of the loss had subsided mr
bond explained to his partners about the mysterious advertisement in the
morning paper and the visit of the detective then the latter was called into
consultation and after he had again furnished a long list of references he was
employed by the firm to recover the bonds
a twentieth century detective

ut

   he seemed well pleased to get the case and assured the firm that the
securities would be recovered at his suggestion it was decided to say noth-
ing about the robbery and to keep it out of the newspapers at all hazards
mr smith also suggested that if the firm had any reason to doubt his ability
to recover their property that they report the case to the police they
agreed to give him three days to demonstrate what he could do

   the following morning there was a  personal in the paper addressed to
x y z appointing an interview the firm had authorized smith to make
terms for the recovery of the bonds

    on the morning of the second day after the discovery of the robbery john
smith called at the bank and again sent in his card to the head of the firm
he was received at once

    what success  mr bond asked

     fair  i have located the property  but we have a crafty rascal to deal
with

    make any terms you please  only recover the bonds before the fact of
the robbery becomes public  

     that is business now we can get along the robber demands twenty
per cent or  for the return of the bonds

    the banker gasped but finding that no better terms could be made finally
agreed to pay the amount

     there is one other condition continued the detective

    what is it

     you must agree not to prosecute

     very well we will agree to that

   then john smith drew from his pocket a very legal looking docunyent
which had evidently been drawn by a lawyer mr bond read it aloud it
was an agreement on the part of his firm that in consideration of the return
of the stolen bonds they would keep the matter quiet and take no steps to
secure the arrest or conviction of any of the guilty parties the banker finally
agreed to sign it

    you have a notary in the bank  the detective asked

   yes

   then we may as well have this document signed now and attested in
proper legal form

   mr bond signed it for the firm and the signature was certified by the
notary of the bank

     i stippose you have the amount of the reward at hand  

    you want the money now  

    certainly it must be paid in advance the people with whom we are
dealing never take any chances  

   the banker went to the safe and returning with a roll of bills of large
denomination counted out the sum of  the detective counted the
money over again very carefully aud finding the amount correct thrust the
bills into the inside pocket of his coat with a smile of satisfaction

   then from another pocket he drew forth a package and handed it to the
banker

    i think you will find your bonds all there he said quietly as he arose
and put on his overcoat

   mr bond hastily opened the package and spreading the contents on the
table in front of him he saw at a glance they were the securities that had
been stolen

   how is this look here sir how did you get possession of these
securities  cried the banker starting up from his chair

     they were intrusted to me for negotiation by the man who robbed you
i am well known in my profession and i always keep my word even with a
bank robber so they do not hesitate to trust me that far you have my card
and if you require the services of a detective at any time i trust you will not
forget me good day  

   with a bow and a smile the man who had recovered the bonds walked out
of the office leaving the head of the firm somewhat perplexed but well
pleased to get back the securities of a customer

   a moment later the door flew open and the junior member of the firm
rushed into the room pale with excitement

     where is he  stop him  dont let him escape   

     stop whom  what are you talking about    cried mr bond

    the man who called himself john smith  he is not a detective 
there is no such person at the address he gave  good heavens mr bond
that man is the greatest bank sneak in the world he is known as  slippery
joe   he stole the bonds when you opened the safe  come he must not
get away   

   there was a wild rush for the outer office led by the head of the firm
mr bond but by the time we reached the street john smith detective had
disappeared in the busy throng always surging up and down the crowded
thoroughfare
