psychiana

the new psychological religion

a new and revolutionary religious teaching based entirely on the misunderstood sayings of the gali-
lean carpenter and designed to show how to find and use the same identical power that he used

psychiana believes and teaches as follows

first-that there is no such thing as a subconscious
     mind

second-that there is in this universe a far more
     potent and dynamic power the manifesta-
     tions of which have been erroneously credited to
     some other supposed power called the subconscious
     mind

third-that this invisible dynamic power is the
     very same power that jesus used when he
     staggered the nations by his so-called miracles
     and by raising the dead

fourth-that jesus had no monopoly on this power

fifth-that it is possible for every normal human
     being understanding spiritual law as he understood
     it to duplicate every work that this
     carpenter of galilee ever did when he
     said the things that i do shall ye do also-he
     meant exactly what he said

sixth-that this dynamic power is not to be
    found within but has its source in a far differ-
    ent direction

seventh-that the words of this galilean
    carpenter went a thousand miles over
    the heads of his hearers  years ago
    and are still a thousand miles over
    the heads of those who profess to fol-
    low him today

eighth-that this same mighty invisible puls-
     ating throbbing power can be used by any-
     one-at any hour of the day or night
     and without such methods as going into the si-
     lence or gazing at bright objects etc

ninth-that when once understood and correctly used
     this mighty power is abundantly able and
     never fails to give health happiness
     and overwhelming success in whatever line
     it may be desired

dr franlc b robinson

founder of psychiana

dr frank b robinson

one of the keenest psychological minds this country has ever produced and one of the most earnest
intense searchers into the spiritual realm believes after years of experimentation and research that
there is in this world today an unseen power or force so dynamic in itself that all other powers or
forces fade into insignificance beside it he believes that this power or force is the very
same power that jesus used he believes further that the entire world including the present
church structure missed in its entirety the message that he came to bring he believes that

the world is on the verge of the most stupendous spiritual upheaval it has ever experienced-the
advent of christ being of small importance when compared to it

every reader of weird tales is cordially invited to write psychiana for more details of this
revolutionary teaching which if true might very easily be discussed the entire world round
dr robinson will tell you something of his years of search for the truth as he knew it must exist

kull the king of valusia has captured the imagination of weird tales
readers to judge by the enthusiastic letters that you have written to this de-
 partment commending robert e howards latest story kings of the night
just as the shadow kingdom and the minors of tuzun thune aroused vast enthu-
siasm so has this latest story in the series fired the readers by the compelling sweep of
its fantasy and the strange power of its style kings of the night easily took first
place in die voting for favorite story in the november issue

     a letter from doctor c p binford of huntsville alabama says the story
kings of the night is undoubtedly the very best i have ever read in your most won-
derful magazine i am only an alabama country doctor but no one reads your magazine
with any more appreciation than i do it is a godsend in kings of the night ethnol-
ogy geography ancient history of lost continents and forgotten races with a skilfully
blended modern version of the latest theories of space and time are masterfully
interwoven into a most interesting tale that bears in every paragraph the stamp and
touch of the very highest type of literary genius verily i thought the same authors
moon of skulls could not be surpassed but kings of the night is as far above it as
the present-day american is above the ape-man of java literature owes a stupendous
debt to robert e howard greatest writer of the twentieth century give us
please some more interstellar stories like edmond hamiltons the cosmic cloud
i really like to leave this minor planet in a second-rate solar system and visit the
great worlds of antares betelgeuse etc

    my favorite author head and shoulders above all others is robert e how-
ard writes doctor arthur h burlong of philadelphia his stories are all splen-
did i have on my library shelves every number of weird tales from number one
to date and now i hope to add to this wealth of reading matter this new and virgin
field of literature offered by the companion magazine oriental stories weird
tales fills a place with me that no other magazine can fill but i will welcome
gladly this new one sponsored by you

    james gartlan of toronto canada who signs himself a wierd tales fan
forever writes to the eyrie i have been a constant reader of weird tales since
 and have enjoyed immensely every story in it it sure is a long hard wait be-
tween issues but it is worth while to obtain the very interesting stories which are
the keynote of weird tales my most ardent plea for you is just keep weird
tales as it has been for the past four years unique in every respect awe-inspiring
and thoroughly interesting

your thought pictures
      turned into realities

visualizing and dreaming of the things you need in life only creates them in the
mind and does not bring them into living realities of usefulness if you can visualize easily
or if there are certain definite needs in your life which you can plainly see in your mind
and are constantly visualizing them as the dreams of your life you should waste no more
time in holding them in the thought world but bring them into the material world of real-
ities what your mind can think and create you can bring into realization if you know
how dont waste your life and happiness that should be yours by dreamingof the things
you need make them become your possessions and serve you

 have found the real simple way

for years i dreamed of the things i wanted and
searched in vain for ways to bring the dreams into
realization i followed all the methods of concentra-
tion and i used affirmations and formulas to bring
thingsto me from the so-called abundant supply of
the cosmic but still i dreamed on and on without any
realization of my fondest hopes all of the instructions
i read and lectures i heard simply helped me to build
up thought pictures in my mind and to visualize more
clearly the things i needed but nothing brought them
into realization

i had heard of the strange oriental methods which en-
abled the people of foreign lands to turn thoughts into
real things and so i searched among their ancient
writings to discover their secret process then i found
a key to the whole simple system in a book that ex-
plains what the rosicrucians and the mystics of egypt
knew so well by this simple method i changed the
whole course of my life and began my life over again
in happiness and prosperity i found at last the
simple way to turn my thought pictures into realiza-
tions

a surprising free helpful book

you need not search as i had to for i will be happy to send
than any you may have ever read and it explains how you
which have helped thousands to start new lives creat-
ing out of their mind power the things they need in
life i will be glad to send you this book if you are
sincere called the light of egypt if you

    i would like to express my admiration for the uncharted isle in the novem-
ber issue writes genevieve k sully of auburn california clark ashton
smiths work always has literary distinction and when that quality is coupled
with superb weird imagination one finds a story well worth reading may i express
a belated word of praise for frank belknap longs story in the september num-
ber the man from egypt mr longs writing denotes an acquaintance with the
finer things and i for one should be glad to read more from one with his scholarly atti-
tude of mind both of these writers whom i have mentioned have nothing of the com-
monplace about their work and you are to be congratulated upon your good taste in
including their stories in your magazine

    a letter from ed esko abelson of chicago says your magazine is im-
proving by leaps and bounds in every way though this months adventure of jules
de grandin is just a murder mystery it makes good reading the story par excel-
lence in this issue in my estimation is a million years after it is quite an unusual
plot tales of the werewolf clan has all the earmarks of a real tragic series

     charles sharts of fremont ohio bursts into verse in a letter to the eyrie
now in my happy married life each month there is a day when there is more or
less of strife and not so much of play it is the day weird tales comes out it
happens every time my wife calls me a lazy lout says im not worth a dime with
that book-its a spooky one-i find an easy seat what care i if the works not
done the stories cant be beat what care i if the coals not in or if the woods
not split if theres no wood in the wood bin let her take care of it what care i
if i milk the cows or if i feed the sows i dont care if i feed the chicks or trim
the oil lamp wicks sometimes i get a dirty look and she gets on her upper but
say if she would get that book then i would get no supper

     let me voice one criticism of your magazine writes m g lichty of astoria
new york i dont believe you should print those interplanetary stories to my
mind theyre not weird and have no place in weird tales particularly as there
are at least three magazines in the field specializing in that type of story i think the
space they occupy could be better devoted to weird stories otherwise i have no crit-
icism to make as i enjoy all the other stories particularly the few that appear from
lovecrafts pen

    allen glasser of new york city writes to the eyrie i have been a silent
but deeply appreciative reader of weird tales since its early issues the first copy
i read contained lovecrafts unforgettable story the rats in the walls and ashes
by c m eddy among others since that far-gone day weird tales has been a
constant source of entertainment to me-entertainment of a sort not often found in
this prosaic world i often wish that i might again experience the thrill of reading
for the first time such incomparable masterpieces as the woman of the wood by
merritt across space by hamilton the tenants of broussac by quinn when the
green star waned by dyalhis on the dead mans chest by colter-but i can not
remember them all nor would i give the impression that i consider the old stories
better than the new i derive unbounded enjoyment from every issue of weird

suppressed  gasped bess

  how on earth did you ever get it

 denly walked into the room together it couldnt
 have created a bigger sensation 

     decameron tales cried bess why hasnt that
 book been tabooed-where did you get it ive heard
 it was so hot they had to cover it with asbestos
 laughed tom

     yes this is really decameron tales and it isnt
 suppressed though ive never found it in stores i got it
 through an announcement clipped out of a magazine
 no other book ever had the amazing background be-
 hind the tales from the decameron by boccaccio writ-
 ten with startling frankness these tales have been a storm
 center of controversy and persecution critics have ac-
 claimed them while puritanical reformers aghast at
 boccaccios expose of human life and love in the raw
 have tried to have it suppressed but now the world is
 more broadminded read the decameron and decide
 for yourself whether it should be banned or censored

 foiowed

 -how the duke of crete paid for a

tales and i am always eager for the next but the true value of a story can best be
gaged in retrospect so if i cast a wistful eye at bygone days it is only because
time has proved their worth

     glad to see old king kull back with us again writes alonso leonard of
portsmouth ohio let us have more stories about him but dont ask me which
story i like best-that is an impossibility as they are all best however i believe
and the readers will agree with me that those stories which are linked together by
a well-known character have more interest than those which are absolutely new
such stories as those about jules de grandin king kull the overlord of cornwall
and the werewolf of ponkert are always sure to hit the mark this is not a plea
to publish no more new stories-only give us more of the connected kind

     paul thibault of san diego california writes to the eyrie i certainly en-
joyed francis flaggs story the jelly-fish it is a pity we readers cant read more of
his stuff it is nearly a year since his the dancer in the crystal appeared in your
magazine whats the matter i believe that i am not the only reader of weird
tales who would enjoy reading more of flaggs stories in the future his stories
are good thats why give us more stories on the order of the dancer in the
crystal

     radio station wtam cleveland is giving you the opportunity of hearing jules

story from this magazine

     i wish weird tales had a little department about the authors who write the
stories in it suggests herbert sloan of zanesville ohio most of us readers are
interested in the writers of weird tales and would enjoy knowing more
about them and where they dig up the stuff that makes these interesting tales i
have often wondered if seabury quinn ever studied medicine before i call this day
complete i am going out in search of the new magazine oriental stories and
feel sure i am going to like it too

     a few months ago writes elvia b scott of boston i started reading weird
tales to kill time while traveling i found it so delightful and diverting that i
have waited eagerly for it ever since in the october issue the mind-master by ed-
mond hamilton has a wonderful grip the last incarnation by wallace west has
the fantastic pull and brings out the religious viewpoint of forgiveness cant we
have more of his a good one by him in a back number i secured was a fanciful
one-something about flowers being converted into nodding ladies heads give us
some longer ones if possible do you ever have continued stories by him

     a tribute to henry s whitehead is paid by william m tanner of sandusky
ohio in a letter to the eyrie a few years back writes mr tanner a copy of
weird tales fell into my hands at a wayside railroad station as the only means of

stories are authentic but more than this every one is a finished product there are
no wild-eyed stories nothing merely made up he works every one out to the last
detail and bases them on real beliefs and customs which can only come from ac-
tual experience in the west indies knowing something about them i particularly
appreciate their reality his finished style showing complete knowledge of the
english language gives him to me pre-eminence among your writers no slips
no awkwardness and a wide vocabulary to put the right word or phrase in every
whitehead story every one is a model of pure and beautiful english painstaking
workmanlike and finished take black tancrede for example a dozen readings
and you get the same mounting horror and climbing goose-flesh every time like-
wise sweet grass the lips-more perhaps than in any other in that first story i
read sea change-there is a thriller for a reprint but for that matter there is a tre-
mendous wallop in each of his stories it is not often that a magazine editor hears
from me but this man has made such an impression i wanted you to know he se-
cured at least one new reader for weird tales

     i was particularly fascinated by the poem by alice ianson in the latest issue
writes robert e howard from his home in texas the writer must surely live in
mexico for i believe that only one familiar with that ancient land could so reflect
the slumbering soul of prehistoric aztec-land as she has done there is a difference
in a poem written on some subject by one afar off and a poem written on the same
subject by one familiar with the very heart of that subject i have put it very clum-
sily but teotihuacan breathes the cultural essence spirit and soul of mexico mr
howard is right alice ianson author of the poem teotihuacan lives in mexico

 and at the last from inner egypt came

 the strange dark one to whom the fellahs bowed

 silent and lean and cryptically proud

 and wrapped in fabrics red as sunset flame

 throngs pressed around frantic for his commands

 but leaving could not tell what they had heard

 while through the nations spread the awestruck word
 that wild beasts followed him and licked his hands

 soon from the sea a noxious birth began

 forgotten lands with weedy spires of gold

 the ground was cleft and mad auroras rolled
 down on the quaking citadels of man

 then crushing what he chanced to mold in play

 the idiot chaos blew earths dust away

         	azathoth

 out in the mindless void the daemon bore me

 past the bright clusters of dimensioned space

 till neither time nor matter stretched before me

 but only chaos without form or place

 here the vast lord of all in darkness muttered
 things he had dreamed but could not understand
 while near him shapeless bat-things flopped and fluttered
 in idiot vortices that ray-streams fanned

 they danced insanely to the high thin whining
 of a cracked flute clutched in a monstrous paw
 whence flow the aimless waves whose chance combining
 gives each frail cosmos its eternal law

 i am his messenger the daemon said

 as in contempt he struck his masters head

	the stranger from cambodia

four miles away where hopkins
point light thrust its thin rapier of
luminance futilely into the relent-
less advance of the sea-mist a fog-horn
hooted with dolorous persistence half a
mile out rising and falling rhythmically
with the undulation of an ocean which
crept forward with a flat oily swell a
bell-buoy sounded a warning mournful
as a funeral toll clank-a-dwg-clank-
a-clang it repeated endlessly

     

  moneen mcdougal glanced at the fog-
obscured window half in annoyance half
in what seemed nervous agitation i
wish it would stop she exclaimed petu-
lantly that everlasting clang-clang is
getting on my nerves a storm would be
preferable to that slow never-ending toll-
ing i cant stand it she shook her nar-
row shoulders in a shudder of repug-
nance

  her big husband smiled tolerantly
dont let it get you old dear he coun-
the elephant on which doctor sun was sitting was directly in the maddened
brutes path

seled well have a capful of wind be-
fore morning thatll change the tempo
for you this fog wont last never does
this time o year to us he added in ex-
planation

  moneens all hot and bothered to-
night her colored boy friend-

  dougal his wife cut in sharply i
tell you he wasnt a negro he was a
chinaman-an oriental of some kind at
any rate ugh she trembled at die
recollection he sickened me

  turning to me she continued i
drove into harrisonville this afternoon

doctor trowbridge and just as i was
leaving braunsteins he stepped up to
me i felt something pawing at my elbow
without realizing what it was then a
hand gripped my arm and i turned
round a tall thin man with a perfect
deaths-head face was bending forward
grinning right into my eyes i started
back and he tightened his grip on my
arm with one hand and reached the other
out to stroke my face then i screamed
i couldnt help it for the touch of those
long bony fingers fairly sickened me

  fortunately the doorman happened

                                       


weird tales

to notice us just then and came running
to my assistance the strange man leaned
over and whispered something i couldnt
understand in my ear then made off
through the crowd of shoppers before
the doorman could lay hold of him
b-r-r-rh she shuddered again i cant
get the memory of that face out of my
mind it was too dreadful

  oh he was probably just some harm-
less nut dougal mcdougal consoled
with a laugh you should feel compli-
mented my dear cheerio christmas is
coming licker up he poured himself
a glassful of napoleon brandy and
raised it toward us with a complimentary
gesture

  jules de grandin replaced his demi-
tasse on the low tabouret of indian ma-
hogany and decanted less than a thimble-
ful of the brandy into a tiny crystal gob-
let exquis he pronounced passing the
little glass beneath his narrow nostrils
savoring the ruby liquors bouquet as a
languishing poet might inhale a rose
from his lady-loves girdle cest sans
comparaison madame monsieur - to
you may you have a truly joyeux noel
he inclined his head toward our hostess
and host in turn then drained his glass
with ritualistic solemnity

  oh but it wont be christmas for
three whole days yet doctor de gran-
din moneen protested and dougal-
the horrid old thing-wont tell me what
my gifts to be

  night after tomorrow is la veille de
noel de grandin reminded with a smile
as he refilled his glass and we can not
be too forehanded with good wishes
madame

  dougal mcdougal and his bride sat
opposite each other across the resined
logs that blazed in the wide marble-
manteled fireplace-the cunningly mod-
ernized fireplace from a vandalized
french chateau-he tall long-limbed

handsome in a dark bleak discontented
fashion a trick of nature and heredity
for by temperament he was neither she
a small slight wisp of womanhood the
white creamy complexion of some long-
forgotten norse ancestor combining
charmingly with her celtic black hair and
pansy eyes clad in a scanty eau-de-nil
garment swinging one boyishly-slim leg
to display its perfection of cobweb silken
sheath and paris slipper the big opu-
lent living-room matched both of them
electric lamps under painted shades
spilled pools of light on bizarre little
tables littered with unconsidered trifles
-cigarette boxes bridge-markers ultra-
modern magazines-the deep mahogany
bookshelves occupying recesses each side
of the mantelpieces hoarded current best-
sellers and standard works of poetry in-
discriminately a grand piano stood in
the deep oriel windows bay the radio
was cunningly camouflaged in a charm-
ing old cabinet of chinese chippendale
here and there showed the blurred blue
mulberry and red of priceless old china
and the dwarfed perfection of exquisitely
chosen miniatures in frames of carved and
heavily gilded wood the room was ob-
viously the shrine of these two bodying
forth their community of treasures tastes
and personalities

  give me a cigarette darling mo-
neen curled up in her deep chair like a
persian kitten on its cushion extended a
bare scented arm toward her big hand-
some husband

  dougal mcdougal proffered her a
hammered silver tray of deities while
de grandin not to be outdone in gal-
lantry leaped nimbly to his feet snapped
his silver pocket lighter into flame and
held the blue-blazing wick out to her till
she set her cigarette aglow

  beg pardon sir tompkins mc-
dougals irreproachable butler bowed
deferentially from the arched doorway

                     w t-
the lost lady



theres a gentleman here - a foreign
gentleman-who insists on seeing doctor
de grandin at once he wont give his
name sir so-

  quick steps sounded on the polished
floor of the hall and an undersized indi-
vidual shouldered the butler aside with a
lack of ceremony i should never have es-
sayed then glanced menacingly about the
room

  on second glance i realized my im-
pression of the visitors diminutive stat-
ure was an error rather he was a giant
in miniature his very lack of height
gave the impression of material equili-
brium and tremendous physical force his
shoulders were unusually broad and his
chest abnormally deep one felt instinc-
tively that the thews of his arms were
massive as those of a gladiator and his
torso sheathed in muscles like that of a
professional wrestler a mop of iron-
gray hair was brushed back in a pompa-
dour from his wide brow and a curling
white mustache adorned his upper lip
while a wisp of white imperial depended
from his sharply pointed chin but the
most startling thing about him was his
cold pale face-a face with the pallor of
a statue-from which there burned a pair
of big deep-set dark eyes beneath hori-
zontal parentheses of intensely black and
bushy brows

  once more the stranger gazed threat-
eningly about then as his glowing eyes
rested on de grandin he announced omi-
nously i am here

  jules de grandins face went blank
with amazement almost with dismay
then lit up with an expression of diaboli-
cal savagery morbleu it is the assas-
sin he exclaimed incredulously leaping
from his seat and putting himself in a
posture of defense

  apache the stranger ground the in-
sult between strong white teeth which
flashed with animal-like ferocity

    w t-

  stealer of superannuated horses de
grandin countered advancing a threat-
ening step toward the other

  pickpocket burglar highwayman
cut-throat everything which is execra-
ble shouted the intruder with a furious
scowl as he shook clenched fists in de
grandins face

  embrasse moi they cried in chorus
and flung themselves into each others
arms like sweethearts reunited after long
parting for a moment they embraced
kissing each others cheeks pounding
each others shoulders with affectionate
fists exchanging deadliest insults in ga-
min french then remembering himself
de grandin put the other from him and
turned to us with a ceremonious bow

  monsieur and madame mcdougal
doctor trowbridge he announced with
stilted formality i have the very great
honor to present monsieur georges jean
joseph marie renouard inspecteur du
service de surete general and the clever-
est man in all the world-except myself
georges abominable stealer-of-blind-
mens-sous that you are permit that i in-
troduce monsieur and madame dougal
mcdougal my host and hostess and
doctor samuel trowbridge skilled phy-
sician and as noble a fellow as ever did
honor to the sacred name of friend it is
with him i have lived since coming to
this country

  inspecteur renouard bent forward in a
jack-knife bow as he raised moneens
hand to his lips bowed again to mc-
dougal then took my hand in a grip
which nearly paralyzed the muscles of my
forearm

  i am delight he assured us mon-
sieur trowbridge your taste in permit-
ting this one to reside beneath your roof
is execrable no less but he is clever-
almost as clever as i-and doubtless he
has imposed on you to make you think
him an honest fellow eh bten i have


weird tales

arrived at last like nemesis to spoil his
little game me i shall show him in his
true colors no less having thus un-
burdened himself he lapsed into a seat
upon the divan accepted a liqueur folded
his large white hands demurely in his
lap and gazed from one of us to the other
with a quick bird-like glance which
seemed to take minute inventory of every-
thing it fell upon

  and what fortunate wind blows you
here mon brave de grandin asked at
length well i know it is no peaceful
mission you travel on for you were ever
the stormy petrel tell me is excitement
promised i grow weary of this so un-
eventful american life

  tiens renouard laughed i think
we shall soon see much excitement-
plenty-mon petit coq as yet i have not
recovered my land legs after traveling
clear about the earth in search of one who
is the devils other self but tomorrow
the hunt begins afresh and then-who
knows yes certainly he nodded
gravely to us in turn then clear from
cambodia i come my friend upon the
trail of the cleverest and wickedest of
clever-wicked fellows-and a lady

  a lady de grandins small blue
eyes lit up with interest you amaze
me

  prepare for more amazement then
mon vieux she is a runaway lady young
beautiful ravissante-he gathered his
fingers at his lips and wafted a kiss gent-
ly toward the ceiling-a runaway baya-
dere from the great temple of angkor
no less

  mordieu you excite me what has
she done

  run away decamped skipped 
precisement great stupid-head but
why should you an inspector of the se-
cret police pursue her

  she ran away from the temple-

renouard began again and

  bete repeat that so senseless state-
ment but one more time and i shall give
myself the pleasure of twisting your
entirely empty head from off your de-
formed shoulders de grandin broke in
furiously

  -and he whom i seek ran after

her his colleague continued imperturb-
ably voila tout it is once again a case
of cherchez la femme

  oh how interesting moneen ex-
claimed wont you tell us more in-
spector renouard

  frenchmen are seldom importuned in
vain by pretty women the inspector was
no exception do you know cambodia
by any unhappy chance he asked flash-
ing his gleaming eyes appreciatively at
the length of silk-sheathed leg moneen
displayed as she sat one foot doubled
under her the other hanging toward the
floor

  we shook our heads and he contin-
ued it is the hottest spot upon the
earth mes amis-hot and wet always
the humidity hovers near one hundred
per cent your clothes are soaked with
perspiration in a few minutes and will
not dry out overnight sheets and bed-
ding are useless for the same reason and
one learns to sleep on tightly stretched
matting or on bare boards clothing mil-
dews and wounds never heal it is the
only land where snakes large enough to
kill by constriction are also venomous
and its spiders bites make that of the ta-
rantula seem harmless by comparison
the natives sleep all day and emerge at
night like bats cats and owls it is a land
unfit for white men

  but this temple dancer-this oriental
girl moneen insisted why do you
follow her here

  she is no oriental madame she too
is white

  white a temple dancing-girl
how-
the lost lady



the inspector lit a cigarette before re-
plying the angkor temple is the
great cathedral of buddhism in southern
asia but it is a buddhism gone to seed
and overgrown with strange rites even as
the lamist buddhism of tibet is bastard-
ized very well this temple of angkor
is a vast stone structure with sculptured
terraces fountains and houses for the
priests and sacred dancers all ceremonies
are held outdoors the terraces being the
scenes of the rites the debased bud-
dhism is a religion of the dance its ser-
vices are largely composed of most beau-
tiful and extremely intricate dances which
often last for days on end nor are they
meaningless or merely ritualistic by no
means like those of the devil-dancers
of the north these ceremonies of the
south have meaning-definite meaning
every movement of arms legs head eye
and lips down to the very angle of hands
and feet conveys a word or phrase or sen-
tence to those who watch and understand
as clearly as the soldiers semaphore flags
convey a meaning to the military observer
it is kind of stenography of motion

   now it can easily be imagined- that
such skill is not acquired overnight no
the dancers are trained almost from the
cradle they are under the absolute con-
trol of the priests the smallest infrac-
tion of a temple rule or even the whim
of a holy man and sentence is forthwith
passed and the unfortunate dancer dies
slowly and in circumstances of great elab-
oration and discomfort

  so much by way of prologue now
for this runaway young lady twenty
years ago a young and earnest man from
your country named joseph crownshield
came to cambodia to preach the word of
god as expounded by authority of the
mennonite church to the benighted fol-
lowers of buddha helas while his zeal
was great his judgment was small he
committed two great errors first in com-

ing to cambodia at all second in having
with him his young wife

   the priests of angkor did not relish
 the things which this monsieur crown-
 shield said they relished even less what
 he did for he was earnest and began to
 convert the natives and gifts for the
 great temple were less plentiful

   the young man died a snake bit
 him as he was about to enter his bath
 snakes have no business in the bathroom
 but - his household servants were of
 course cambodians and the priesthood
 numbered expert snake-charmers among
 its personnel at any rate he died

   misfortunes seldom come singly two
  days later the church and parsonage
 burned down and in the smoking ruins
 was found the body of a woman ma-
 dame crownshield perhaps who can
 say at all events the body was interred
 beside the missionarys and life went on
 as usual but sixteen years later came ru-
 mors to the french gendarmerie of a dan-
 cer in the temple a girl who danced like
 a flame in the wind like a moonbeam on
 flowing water like the twinkling of a
 star at midnight and rumor said
 though her hair was black it was fine as
 split-silk not coarse like that of the na-
 tive women and her skin was fair as milk
 and her eyes blue as violets in springtime

   devotees of the temple are not sup-
 posed to speak to outsiders the penalty
 of an unguarded tongue is lingering
 death but-the ear of the surete is keen
 and its arm is very long we learned that
 rumor was well founded within the
 temple there was such an one and she
 was even as rumor described her though
 she never emerged from her dwelling-
 place within the sacred edifice her pres-
 ence there was definitely established un-
 questionably she was white equally be-
 yond question she had no business where

 she was but- he paused spreading

 his hands and puflsng out his cheeks it


weird tales

is not wise to trifle with the religion of
the natives he ended simply

  but who was she moneen asked

  parbleu i would give my tongue to
the cat if i could answer you the inspec-
tor returned the surete found itself
against a wall of stone more stubborn
than that of which the temple was com-
posed in that god-detested land we
learn much if one fasts long enough he
will hear voices and see visions the poi-
sons of certain drugs and the toxins of
certain fevers have the same effect occa-
sionally the spirit of buddha permeates
the soul of a white man-more frequent-
ly a white woman-in the tropics the
accumulated toxic effect of the climate
leads him-or her-to give up the mate-
rialistic cleanly civilization of the west
and retire to a life of squalor filth and
contemplation as a devotee of some east-
ern faith had this happened here was
this girl self-devoted as a dancer in the
temple had her mother perhaps de-
voted herself years ago and had the child
been born and reared in the shadow of
the temple idols one wonders

  but surely you investigated moneen
pursued

  but naturally madame i am re-
nouard i do not do things by the half
no

  to the angkor temple i went and de-
manded sight of her there is no such
person here i was assured

   you lie i answered courteously
and unless you bring her to me forthwith
i shall come in for her

  eh bien messieurshe turned to us
with a chuckle the frenchman is logical
he harbors no illusions about the love of
subject peoples nor does he seek to con-
ciliate them love him they may not but
fear and respect him they must my hint
was sufficient-especially as two platoons
of gendarmerie a howitzer and machine-
guns were there to give it point the lady

whose existence had been denied so vehe-
mently a moment before was straightway
brought to me

  beyond doubt she was pure european
her hair was black and gently waved her
skin was white as curdled cream her eyes
were blue as - parbleu madame - he
gazed at moneen mcdougal with wide-
open eyes as though he saw her for the
first time-she was much like you

   i thought i saw a shiver of terror ripple
through moneens lithe form but her
husbands hearty laugh relieved the ten-
sion well who was she he asked

  le bon dieu knows renouard re-
turned although i made the ape-faced
priests retire so that we might converse
unheard they had either terrified the girl
that she dared not speak or she was actu-
ally unable to inform me i spoke to her
in every language that i know-and they
are many - but only the lingo of the
khmer could she understand or speak
her name she said was thi-bah she was
a sacred dancer in the temple and she
remembered no other world she had al-
ways lived there of her parentage she
could not speak for father or mother she
had never known and at the end she
joined hands together palm to palm the
fingers pointing downward-which is the
symbol of submission - and begged i
would permit her to go back to her place
among the temple women sacre nom
what is one to do in such circumstances
nothing

  that is what i did i retired in cha-
grin and she returned to her cell within the
temple

  bien oui de grandin tweaked the
needle points of his little blond mustache
and grinned impishly at the inspector
but a tale half told is poorly told my
friend what of this other one this so
clever-devilish fellow whom you trail
while he trails the runaway lady hein
the lost lady



renouard joined his square-tipped
 fingers end to end and pursed his
lips judicially oui-dahe admitted
that is the other half of the tale indeed
very well regardez-moi bien in cochin
china in the days before the great war
there lived a certain gentleman named
sun ah poy he was as you may gather
from his name chinese but his family
had been resident in saigon for gener-
ations the sun family is so numerous in
china that to bear the name means little
more than for a frenchman to be called
dupont or an englishman smith or an
irishman murphy nevertheless all
these names have had their famous rep-
resentatives as you will recall when you
think of your great colonizer captain
john smith and the illustrious albert of
the present generation also you will re-
member chinas first president was doc-
tor sun yat sen

  this sun ah poy was no shopkeeping
son of a coolie father he was an educated
gentleman a man of great wealth taught
by private tutors in the learning of the
east and holding a diploma from the sor-
bonne his influence with the native pop-
ulation was phenomenal and his opinions
were eagerly sought and highly regarded
by the conseil prive he wore the ribbon
of the legion of honor for distinguished
service to the republic this then was
the man who a few days before the ar-
mistice went up-country to supervise an
elephant hunt

  a savage old tusker had been roped
between two trained beasts and was being
led into the stockade when without warn-
ing he broke his fetters and charged the
elephant on which doctor sun was seated
was directly in the maddened brutes
path in a moment the runaway beast had
seized the unfortunate man in his trunk
snatched him from his saddle and hurled
him forty feet through the air crashing
him into the wall of the stockade

  medicine and surgery did their best
sun ah poy lived helas when he rose
from his hospital bed it was with body
and mind hopelessly crippled the phys-
ical injury was apparent to all the mental
ailment we were to find out to our cost
insubordination broke out among the na-
tives french officers were openly dis-
obeyed criminals were permitted to
escape from prison laborers on the pub-
lic works were assaulted and beaten
sometimes killed the process of criminal
jurisprudence broke down completely
for witnesses could not be made to tes-
tify gendarmes went forth to make ar-
rests and came back feet first examining
magistrates who prosecuted investigations
with honest thoroughness died myste-
riously and most opportunely for the
criminals-official records of the police
disappeared from their files overnight
it was all too obvious that outlawry had
raised its red standard and hurled defi-
ance at authority

  in paris this would have been bad in
asia it was unspeakable for the white
man must keep his prestige at all costs
once he loses face his power over the
natives is gone what was to do

  at length like men of sound discre-
tion the government put the case in my
charge i considered it from all angles
i viewed it what did i see a single
dominating intelligence seemed guiding
all the lawlessness an intelligence which
knew beforehand what plans government
made i cast about for suspects and my
eye fell on three sun ah poy and two
others he seemed least likely of the
three but he enjoyed our confidence and
it lay within his power to thwart our plans
if he so desired therefore i laid my trap
i called three councils of war to each of
which a different suspect was invited at
these councils i outlined my plans for
raiding certain known centers of the crim-
inal elements the first two raids were


weird tales

successful we caught our game red-
handed the third raid was a glorious
failure only a brightly glowing camp-
fire and a deserted encampment waited
for the gendarmes it was of this raid i
had spoken to doctor sun

  proof not in english courts nor
american but this was under french
jurisdiction we do not let the guilty
escape through fear of affronting the pos-
sibly innocent no i issued a warrant for
doaor suns apprehension

  that evening as i sat within my cab-
inet i heard a dicking-scratching on the
matting-covered floor sapristi toward
me there charged full-tilt a giant taran-
tula the greatest most revolting-looking
spider i had ever seen now it is seldom
that these brutes attack a man who does
not annoy them that they should delib-
erately attack an inoffensive passive per-
son is almost beyond experience yet
though i sat quiescent at my table this
one made for me as though he had a per-
sonal feud to settle fortunately for me
i was wearing my belt and with a single
motion i leaped upon the table drew my
pistol and fired my bullet crushed the
creature and i breathed again but that
night as i rode home to my quarters a
second poison-spider dropped from a
tree-bough into my rickshaw i struck it
with my walking-stick and killed it but
my escape was of the narrowest when i
went into my bathroom i found a small
but very venomous serpent coiled ready
to receive me

  it struck i leaped grand dieu i
leaped like a monkey-on-the-stick and
came down with my heels upon its head
i triumphed but my nerves were badly
shaken

  my men returned sun ah poy was
nowhere to be found he had decamped
who warned him my native clerk per-
haps the tentacles of this octopus i

sought to catch stretched far and into the
most unexpected places

  i walked in constant terror every-
where i went i carried my revolver ready
even in my house i went about with a
heavy cane in my hand for i knew not
what instant silent death would come
striking at my feet or dropping on me
from the ceiling

  at length my spies reported progress
a new priest a crippled man was in the
angkor temple he was enamoured of
the white dancer they said it was well
where the lioness lairs the lion will sure-
ly linger i went to take him nor did i
confide my plans to any but frenchmen

  helas the love which makes the
world to move also spoiled my coup

  the khmer are an effeminate lasciv-
ious well-nigh beardless race all traces
of virility have vanished from them and
craft had replaced strength in their deal-
ings thi-bah the white-girl dancer had
lived her life within the confines of the
temple and except myself i doubt that
she had seen a single white man in her
whole existence-till monsieur archibald
hildebrand appeared he was young
handsome vigorous mustached-all that
the men she knew were not moreover
he was of her race and like calls to like
in cambodia as in other places how he
met her i do not know nor how he made
himself understood for she spoke no
english he no khmer but a gold key
unbars all doors and the young man from
america had gold in plenty also love
makes mock of lexicons and speaks its
own language and they had love these
two enfin they met they loved they
eloped

  it may seem strange that this could
be for the whole world knows that
temple-women of the east are well-nigh
as carefully guarded as inmates of the
zenana elsewhere yes but in cambodia
no there night is day and day is night
the lost lady



in the torrid steaming heat of day the
population sleeps or tries to and only
fleeing criminals and foreigners unaccus-
tomed to the land are abroad one might
mount the temple terraces and steal the 
head from off a carven buddha and never
find a temple guard to say him nay pro-
vided he went by daylight so it was
here thi-bah the dancer had but to creep
forth from her cell on soft-stepping un-
shod feet meet her lover in the sunlight
and go away

  two days before i arrived at angkor
with handcuffs already warmed to fit the
wrists of him i sought monsieur hilde-
brand and this thi-bah set sail from sai-
gon on a messageries maritimes steam-
ship one day later doctor sun ah poy
shook the dust of cochin china from his
feet he did it swiftly silently he
dropped down the saigon river in a sam-
pan was transferred to a junk at sea and
vanished-where whither

  here we asked in breathless chorus

  where else the man is crazed with
love or passion or whatever you may
choose to call it he is fabulously rich
infinitely resourceful diabolically wicked
and inordinately vain as all such criminal
lunatics are where the moth of his de-
sire flutters the spider will not be long
absent although he did not travel as
quickly as the fleeing lovers he will soon
arrive when he does i have grave fears
for the health of monsieur hildebrand
and his entire family they are thorough
these men from the east and their blood-
feuds visit the sins of the sons upon the
ancestors unto the third and fourth gen-
eration

  can that be our archy hildebrand
doctor trowbridge moneen asked

  inspector renouard drew forth a small
black-leather notebook and consulted it
monsieur archibald van buren hilde-
brand son of monsieur van rensselaer
hildebrand he read address of

house  ruepassaic-he pronounced
it pay-sa-ay-harrisonville new jer-
sey e u a

  why that is archy moneen ex-
claimed oh i hope nothing happens

  nonsense dear her husband cut in
bruskly what could happen here this
is america not cochin china the po-
lice-

  tiens monsieur de grandin re-
minded frigidly they also have police in
cambodia

  oh yes of course but-

  i hope you are correct the little
frenchman interrupted me i do not
discount anything which inspecteur re-
nouard may say he is no alarmist as i
very well know eh bien you may be
right but in the meantime a little pre-
paredness can do no harm

	doctor sun leaves his card

at my invitation the inspector agreed
k-to make my house his headquarters
and it was arranged that he and de gran-
din share the same room midnight had
long since struck when we bid the mcdou-
gals adieu and began our twenty-mile
drive to the city remember youre all
invited here christmas evening moneen
reminded us at parting im expecting my
sister avis down from holyoke and i
know shed love to meet you

  we left the fog behind us as we drove
northward from the ocean and the night
was clear and cold as we whizzed through
susquehanna avenue to my house

  thats queer i muttered as i bent
to insert my latchkey in the lock some-
body must know youre here inspector
heres a note for you i picked up the
square white envelope which had dropped
as i thrust the door open and put it in his
hand

  he turned the folder over and over in-


weird tales

specting the clear-cut boldly written
inscription looking in vain for a clue to
the sender who can know-who could
suspect that i am arrived he began won-
deringly but de grandin interrupted with
a chuckle

  you are incurably the detective mon
georges he rallied you receive a let-
ter parbleu who can have sent this
you ask you and thereupon you examine
the address you take tests of the ink you
consult handwriting experts this is
from a lady you say to yourself and
from the angle of the letters in her writ-
ing i am assured she is smitten by my
manly beauty thereupon you open the
note and find what that it is a bill for
long-overdue charges on your laundry
cordieu come open it great stupid-
head how otherwise are you to learn
from whom it comes

  silence magpie renouard retorted
his pale face flushing under de grandins
mockery we shall see-mon dieu
look

  the envelope contained a single sheet
of dull white paper folded in upon itself
to form a sort of frame in which there
rested a neatly engraved gentlemans vis-
iting-card

dr sun ah poy

                                saigon

that was all no other script or print

  eh bien he is impudent that one
de grandin exclaimed bending over his
friends shoulder to inspect the missive
parbleu he laughs at our faces but i
think all the cards are not yet played we
shall see who laughs at whom before this
game is ended for-

  he broke off abruptly head thrown
bade delicate nostrils contracting and ex-
panding alternately as he sniffed the air
suspiciously do you too get it he
asked turning from renouard to me in-
quiringly

i think i smell some sort of perfume

but i cant quite place it- i began

but his exclamation cut me short

  drop it mon vieux-unhand it right
away at once immediately he cried
seizing renouards wrist and fairly shak-
ing the card from his grasp ah-so
permit it to remain there he continued
staring at the upturned square of paste-
board trowbridge renouard mes
amis i suggest you stand back-mount
chairs-keep your feet well off the floor
so that is better

  we stared at him in open-mouthed
astonishment as he barked his staccato or-
ders but as he matched command with
obedience and mounted a chair himself
after the manner of a timid housewife
who sights a mouse we followed suit

  from the shaft of his gold-headed eb-
ony opera cane he drew the slender wire-
like sword-blade and swished it once or
twice through the air as though to test its
edge attend me he commanded fix-
ing his level unwinking stare on us in
turn like you friend georges i have
lived in cambodia while you were still
among the riffs in africa i went to nose
out certain disaffections in annam and
while there i kept eyes ears and nose
wide open certainly tell me my friend
-think back think carefully-just what
happened that night in saigon when you
were beset by spiders

  renouards bright dark eyes narrowed
in concentration my laundry was de-
layed that day he answered at length
the messenger had good excuses but my
white uniforms did not arrive until-
nom dune pipe-yes upon the freshly
starched-and-ironed drill there hung a
faint perfume such as we smell here and
now

  exactement de grandin nodded
me i recognized him almost imme-
diately he is a concentrated extract or
a synthetic equivalent for the scent ex-
creted by a great-and very poisonous-
the lost lady



cambodian spider to attract its mate i
damn suspected something of the kind
when you related your experience at
monsieur mcdougals but i did not put
you to the cross-examination then lest i
frighten our pretty hostess who had al-
ready received one shock today of which
i must inform you but hist my friends
tegardez

  something squat and obscene some-
thing like a hand amputated at the wrist
long mummified and overgrown with
spiny prickles but now endued with some
kind of ghastly after-life which enabled it
to flop and crawl upon bent fingers came
sliding and slithering across the floor of
the hall emerging from the darkness of
my consulting-room

  ah-ha ab-ha-ha monsieur la taren-
tule you have walked into our parlor it
would seem de grandin cried exultant-
ly the razor-edged needle-pointed sword
whistled through the air as he flung it
from his vantage-point upon the chair
stabbing through the crawling creatures
globular body and pinning it to the floor
but still the dry hairy legs fought and
thrashed as the great spider sought to
drag itself toward the scented card which
lay a yard or so beyond it wriggle
parbleu de grandin invited mockingly
as he dropped from his refuge on the
chair and advanced toward the clawing
monster wriggle writhe and twist your
venom will not find human flesh to poi-
son this night no pardieu with a
quick stamp of his heel he crushed the
thing withdrew the sword which pin-
ioned it to the floor and wiped the steel
upon the rug

  it was fortunate for us that my nose
and memory co-operated he remarked
he was clever your friend sun mon
hrave i grant you the card all smeared
with perfume as it was was addressed to
you naturally your hands would be the
first to touch it had we not acted as we

did you would have been a walking in-
vitation to that one-he nodded toward
the spiders carcass-and i do not think
he would have long delayed responding
no assuredly you would have moved
when he leaped on you and pouf tomor-
row or the next day or the next day
after that at latest we should have had
the pleasure of attending a solemn high
mass of requiem for you for his bite is
very poisonous

  you dont suppose any more of those
things are hiding round the house do
you i asked uncomfortably

   i doubt it he returned renouards
friend could not have had time to pack
an extensive kit before he left and spi-
ders and reptiles of the tropics are difficult
to transport especially in this climate
no i think we need have small fear of a
repetition of that visit tonight at least
also if there be others the center of at-
traction will be the scented card they
will not trouble us unless we tread on
them

for several minutes after we had
entered the study he sat in silent
thought at last they can not know
for sure what room you will occupy mon
georges he remarked but the bath-
room is always easily identified trow-
bridge my friend do you happen to pos-
sess such a thing as a sheet of fly-paper
at this time

   fly-paper i asked astonished

  but certainly the stuff with which
one catches flies he answered going
through the pantomime of a luckless fly
alighting on a sheet of tanglefoot and
becoming enmeshed on it

   i hardly think so i replied but we
can look in the pantry if nora had any
left over in the autumn she probably
stored it there

   we searched the pantry shelves as pros-


weird tales

pectors might hunt the hills for gold at
last triomphe de grandin called from
his perch upon a step-ladder eureka i
have found it from the uppermost
shelf he dragged a packet of some half a
dozen sticky sheets

  we warmed the stuff at the furnace
door and when its adhesive surface was
softened to his satisfaction de grandin
led us to the bathroom stealthily he
pushed the door open dropped a double
row of fly-paper on the tiled floor then
with the handle of a mop began explor-
ing the recesses beneath the tub and
behind the washstand

  we had not long to wait almost at
the second thrust of the mop-handle a
faint almost soundless hissing noise like
steam escaping from a gently boiling ket-
tle came to us and as he probed again
something like a length of old-fashioned
hair watch-chain seemed to uncoil itself
upon the white-tile floor and slither with
the speed of light across the room it was
a dainty little thing no thicker than a
lead-pencil and scarcely longer prettily
marked with alternating bands of black
yellow and red

  sacre nom renouard exclaimed he
drapeau allemand

  de grandin bent still farther forward
thrust his stick fairly at the tiny writhing
reptile and endeavored to crush its small
flat head against the wall the thing
dodged with incredible quickness and so
swiftly i could scarcely follow its motion
with my eye struck once twice three
times at the wood and i watched it won-
deringly for it did not coil to strike but
bent its head quickly from side to side
like a steel spring suddenly set vibrating
by the touch of a finger

  you see he asked simply still prod-
ding at the flashing scaly thing

  although his efforts to strike it were
unsuccessful his strategy was well
planned for though it dodged his flailing

stick with ease the snake came ever
nearer to the barricade of fly-paper which
lay before the door at last it streaked
forward passed fairly over the sticky
paper then gradually slowed down
writhed impotently a moment then lay
still its little red mouth gaping lambent
tongue flickering from its lips like a
wind-blown flame low almost inaudible
hisses issuing from its throat

  you have right my friend it is the
german flag so called because it bears
the german national colors in its mark-
ings he told renouard a tiny thing
it is yet so venomous that the lightest
prick of its fangs means certain death
for aid can not be given quickly enough
to counteract its poison in the blood
also it can strike as you noticed and
strike again without necessity for coiling
one has but to step on or even near it in
darkness or in light for that matter-
and he is lucky if its venom allows him
time to make his tardy peace with heaven
it is of the order elapidae this little poi-
son thing a small but worthy cousin of
the king cobra the death adder and the
tiger snake of australia

  he bore the fly-paper with its helpless
prisoner to the cellar and flung it into the
furnace exeunt omnes he remarked
as the flames destroyed the tiny cylinder
of concentrated death die you must
eventually friend georges but it was not
written that you should die by snake-bite
this night no your friend doctor sun
is clever but so is jules de grandin and
i am here come let us go to bed it is
most fatiguing this oversetting of doc-
tor suns plans for your american recep-
tion my friend

a tang of frost and hint of snow in

and did ample justice to the panned sole

waffles and honey in the comb which
nora mcginnis had prepared for break-
fast renouard particularly was in a
happy mood for the joy the born man-
hunter takes in his work was fairly over-
flowing in him as he contemplated the
game of hide-and-seek about to com-
mence

  first of all he announced as he
scraped the last remaining spot of honey
from his plate i shall call at the prefec-
ture de police and present my credentials
they will help me they will recognize
me yes

  undoubtlessly they will recognize
you mon enfant de grandin agreed
with a nod none could fail to do so

  renouard beamed but i discerned the
hidden meaning of de grandins state-
ment and had all i could do to keep a
sober face innate good taste cosmo-
politan experience and a leaning toward
the english school of tailoring marked
jules de grandin simply as a more than
ordinarily well-dressed man wherever he
might be renouard by contrast could
never be mistaken for other than what
he was an efficient officer of the gendar-
merie out of uniform and the trade mark
of his nationality was branded indelibly
on him his rather snugly fitting suit was
that peculiarly horrible shade of blue
beloved of your true frenchman his shirt
was striped with alternate bands of blue
and white his cravat was a thing to give
a haberdasher a violent headache and his
patent leather boots with their round
rubber heels tapered to sharp and most
uncomfortable-looking points

  but of course he told us i shall
say to them messieurs if you have here
a stout fellow capable of assisting me i
beg you will assign him to this case i

greatly desire the assistance of-

 sergeant costello nora mcginnis
announced as she appeared in the break-

fast room door the big red-headed irish
detective towering behind her

  ah welcome mon vieux de gran-
din cried rising and extending a cordial
hand to the caller a merry christmas
to you

  an th same to ye sor an ye too
gentlemen costello returned favoring
renouard and me with a rather sickly
grin

  how now you do not say it heart-
ily de grandin said as he turned to in-
troduce inspector renouard you are in
trouble good tell us we shall un-
doubtlessly be able to assist you

  im hopin so sor the sergeant re-
turned as he drew up a chair and accepted
a cup of steaming coffee im afther
needin help this mornin

  a robbery a murder blackmail kid-
napping de grandin ran through the
catalogue of crime which is it or is it
a happy combination of all

  mebbe so sor im not quite sure yet
meself costello replied ye see twas
early this mornin it happened an i aint
got organized yet so to speak it were
like this sor

  a miss brindell come over to har-
rison ville on th six oclock train she
wuz cornin to visit her sister who lives
down on th south shore an they hadnt
expected her so early so theres no one to
meet her when she gits to th station
she knows about where her brother-in-
laws house is over to marys landin so
she hops in a taxi an starts there twere
a twenty-mile drive sor but shes satis-
fied wid th price so th cabby dont

other car crowds im to th curb an

  but you know her name how is

in th taxi when we went through it an

miss avis brindell whod come to visit
her brother-in-law an sister mr an
mrs dougal mcdougal at their house at
marys landin so-

  nom dun chou-fleur do you tell me
so de grandin gasped madame mc-
dougals sister kidnapped by orientals
ha can it be possible one wonders

  whats that sor

  i think your taximan is innocent my
friend but i am glad you have him read-
ily available de grandin answered
come let us go interview him right
away immediately at once

mr sylvester mccarty driver of
purple cab  was in a far
from happy frame of mind when we
found him in the detention ward of cas-
ualty hospital his day had started in-
auspiciously with the wreck of his
machine the loss of a more than usually
large fare considerable injury to his per-
son finally with the indignity of arrest
its a weepin shame thats what it is
he told us as he finished the recital of his
woes im an honest man sir an-

  agreed by all means de grandin
interrupted soothingly that is why we
come to you for help my old one tell
us if you will just what occurred this
morning-describe the cowardly mis-
creant who struck you down before you
had a chance to voice your righteous in-
dignation i am sure we can arrange for
your release from durance
the lost lady



  mccarty brightened its hard to tell
you much about it sir he answered fer
it all happened so quick-like i hardly had
time to git me bearins after im
crowded to th curb an me wheels
dished i sees th other car is jammed
right smack agin me an just as i turns
round i hears me fare holler leave me
be take yer hands offn me

  wid that i jumps down an picks up
me crank-handle fer if theres goin to be
a argyment i figures on bein prepared
i ony gits one eye-flash at em though
sir theres a queer-lookin sort o gink
settin at th wheel o th other car-a
brown-faced guy not colored nor yet not
quite like a chinee but more like some o
them fillypinos ye see around some-
times ye know hes all muffled up in a
fur coat wid th collar turned up around
his chin an his cap pulled down over his
eyes so i cant git much of a slant on him
but just as i starts in to tell him what
sort o people i think his family wuz up
hops another coffee-an-cream-colored
son-of-a-gun an zingo lets me have a
bop over th bean that makes me see all
th stars there is right in broad daylight
i goes over like th kingpin when a feller
rolls a strike but just before i goes to
sleep i sees th guy that smacked me
down an another one hustlin th young
lady out o me cab into th other car then
th chauffeur steps on her an rolls away
leavin me flattern a pancake then i
goes out like a light an th next thing i
knows im layin here in th horsepittle
wid a bandage round me dome an th
nurse is sayin sit up now an drink
this 

  um de grandin regarded him
gravely and did you notice the make
of car which fouled you

  not rightly sir but it was big an
long-a limousine i thought it wuz a
rolls though it might o been a renault

or issotta-i dont think it wuz an amer-
ican car

  very good and one presumes it is
too much to hope you had opportunity to
note die number

  i did that sir we gits camera-eyed
in this racket an th first thing we do
when any one fouls us is to look at his
number its second nature

  ah fine excellent parfait tell

  x  -  sir jersey plates

  ah my prince of chauffeurs i salute
you assuredly it was nobly done ser-
geant you will surely let him go now
sure costello grunted you can
run along feller but dont try any hide-
away business well know where to git
ye when we want ye dont forgit

  sure you will mr mccarty assured
him earnestly right by th depot chief
im there ter meet all th trains

  an now fer th number costello
chuckled bedad doctor de grandin
sor this case is easier than i thought im
sorry i bothered ye wid it now

  not too fast my friend the french-
man counseled the prudent cat does
not mistake all that is white for milk
five minutes later costello returned
from a telephone conversation with the
license bureau i reckon i wuz all wet
doctor de grandin he admitted rue-
fully x  -  is th plate o glea-
sons grocery car its a ford delivery
truck an its plates wuz stolen last night
whilst it was standin in front o th
store

for a moment we stared at each other
in blank consternation que diable
swore renouard grasping his tuft of
beard and jerking it so violently that i
feared for his chin

  looks that way costello nodded dis-


weird tales

mally understanding the frenchmans
tone if not his words

  sacre nom de dix mille sales cochons
de grandin exclaimed why do we
stand here looking ourselves out of coun-
tenance like a convention of petrified
bullfrogs in the musee de ihistoire
naturelle let us be doing

  sez you costello responded doin
what sor

  finding them pardieu consider
their appearance was bizarre enough to
be noted by the excellent monsieur mc-
carty even in the little minute between
the collision of their vehicle and his and
the blow which struck him senseless
very well will not others notice them
likewise i think so they have not been
here long there has been small time to
acquire a base of operations yet they
must have one they must have a house
probably not far from here very good
let us find the house and we shall have
found them and the missing lady as
well

   all right ill bite costello offered
whats th answer to that one

  cordieu it is so simple even you
should see it the frenchman retorted
it is like this they have scarcely had
time to consummate a purchase besides
that would be wasteful for they require
only a temporary abode very well then
what have they done rented a house
nest-ce-pas i think likely we have
then but to set a corps of energetic in-
vestigators to the task of soliciting the
realty agents of the city and when one
tells us he has let a house to an oriental
gentleman-voila we have him in our
net certainly

  sure it sounds o k costello
agreed but th only thing wrong wid it
is it wont work just because th assist-
ant villains who kidnapped th pore little
lady this mornin wuz a lot o monkey-

faced chinks is no sign th head o th
gangs one too tis more likely hes a
white man usin chinese to do his dirty

work sos hell not be suspected an-

  and it is entirely probable that pigs
would fly like birds had they the neces-
sary wings de grandin interrupted bit-
ingly i say no me i know-at least
i damn suspect-what all this devils
business means and i am sure an oriental
is not only the head but the brains of
this crew of apaches as well come mon
fils do as i say we shall succeed we
must succeed

  dubiously costello agreed and two
officers at headquarters were given copies
of the classified telephone directory and
bidden go down the list of real estate
agents systematically phoning each and
inquiring whether he had rented a dwell-
ing to a chinese gentleman during the
past week or ten days meantime de
grandin smoked innumerable cigarettes
and related endless risque stories to the
great edification of the policemen loung-
ing in the squad room i excused myself
and hurried to the office for consulting
hours had come and i could not neglect
my practise

the seasonal number of coryza cases
presented themselves for treatment
and i was wondering whether i might
cut short the consultation period since no
more applicants for seilers solution and
dovers powder seemed imminent when
a young man hurried into the office tall
lean sun-bitten till he almost resembled
a malay he was the kind of chap one
took to instantly a scrubbed-with-cold-
water cleanliness and vigor showed in
every line of his spare face and figure
his challenging you-be-damned look was
softened by the humorous curve of the
wide thin-lipped mouth beneath his dark
close-dipped mustache only the lines of
the lost lady



habit showed humor now however for
an expression of keen anxiety was on his
features as he advanced toward me i
dont know whether youll remember me
or not doctor trowbridge he opened
while still ten feet from me but youre
one of my earliest recollections im

archy hildebrand my father-

   why surely i remember you son i
returned though i dont know id have
recognized you we were talking about
you last night

were eh he answered grimly
suppose you particularized concerning
how many different kinds of a fool ive
made of myself well let me tell


you-

   not at all i cut in as i noted the
quick anger hardening in his eyes a
french gentleman from saigon was out
to mcdougals last night and he hap-
pened to mention your romance and we
were all greatly interested he seemed to

think-

  was he a policeman archy inter-
rupted eagerly

  why-er-yes i suppose you might
call him that hes an inspector in the

s arete general and-

   thank the lord maybe hell be able
to help us but i need you first sir
whats the matter i began but he
literally dragged me toward the door

   its thi-bah my wife sir i met her
in cambodia and married her in france
no time to go into particulars now but
she-shes in a bad way sir and i wish
youd see her as soon as you can it
seems like some sort of eruption and its
dreadfully painful wont you come
now right away

   mais certainement right away imme-
diately de grandin assured him appear-
ing with the abruptness of a phantom at
the consulting-room door we shall be
most happy to place ourselves at the entire

disposal of madame your wife young
monsieur

  as hildebrand stared at him in open-
mouthed astonishment he explained i
have but just entered the house and it
was impossible for me not to overhear
what you said to doctor trowbridge i
have had much experience with the
obscure diseases of the orient whence
madame hildebrand came and i am sure
i shall be of assistance to friend trow-
bridge if you do not object to my enter-
ing the case with him he paused on a
questioning note and regarded archy
with a frank disarming smile

  delighted to have you i put in
before the younger man could express an
opinion i know youll be glad of doc-
tor de grandins assistance too archy
i added

  certainly he agreed only hurry
please gentlemen she may be suffering
another attack right now and shes so
lonely without me-im the only one who
understands her you see

  we nodded sympathetically as we left
the house and a moment later i had
headed the car toward the hildebrand
mansion

   perhaps you can give us a description
of madames malady de grandin asked
as we spun along

   archy flushed beneath his coat of tan
im afraid itll be hard to tell you he
returned slowly you know-he
paused a moment then continued in evi-
dent embarrassment-if such a thing
were possible id say shes the victim of
a poltergeist

  eh what is it you say the french-
man demanded sharply

the young man misunderstood his
query a poltergeist he returned
ive seen what they declared to be their

the horror
from the hills

    by frank belknap long jr

       a goose-flesh story of cosmic menace-a stone idol brought

                            from china

  	the coming of the stone beast

in a long low-ceilinged room
adorned with egyptian graeco-
roman minoan and assyrian antiq-
uities a thin careless-seeming young man
of twenty-six sat jubilantly humming
as nothing in his appearance or manner
suggested the scholar-he wore gray
tweeds of collegiate cut gray spats
striped blue shirt and collar and a ridicu-
lously brilliant cravat-the uninitiated
were inclined to regard him as a mere
supernumerary in his own office stran-
gers entered unannounced and called him
young man at least twenty times a
week and he was frequently asked to
convey messages to a non-existent supe-
rior no one suspected no one dreamed
until he enlightened them that he was
the lawful custodian of the objects about
him and even when he revealed his iden-
tity people surveyed him with distrust and
were inclined to suspect that he was iron-
ically pulling their legs

  algernon harris was the young mans
name and graduate degrees from yale
and oxford set him distinctly apart from
the undistinguished majority but it is
to his credit that he never paraded his
erudition nor succumbed to the impulse
-almost irresistible in a young man with
academic affiliations-to put a phd on
the title page of his first book

  it was this book which had endeared
him to the directors of the manhattan
museum of fine arts and prompted their


unanimous choice of him to succeed the
late halpin chalmers as curator of ar-
cheology when the latter retired in the fall
of 

  in less than six months young harris
had exhaustively familiarized himself
with the duties and responsibilities of his
office and was becoming the most success-
ful curator that the museum had ever em-
ployed so boyishly ebullient was he so
consumed with investigative zeal that his
field workers contracted his enthusiasm as
though it were a kind of fever and sped
from his presence to trust their scholarly
and invaluable lives to slant-eyed fero-
cious orientals and gibbering hairy in-
dians andentirely naked black men on
the most detestable crustal sections of our
planet

  and now they were coming back-for
days now they had been coming back-
occasionally with haggard faces and once
or twice unfortunately with something
radically wrong with them the symons
tragedy was a case in point symons
was a chang dynasty specialist and he
had been obliged to leave his left eye and
a piece of his nose in a buddhist temple
near a place called fen chow fu but
when algernon questioned him he could
only mumble something about a small
malignant face with corpsy eyes that had
glared and glared at him out of a purple
mist and francis hogarth lost eighty
pounds and a perfectly good right arm
somewhere between lake rudolph and
naivasha in british east africa

                    w t-
the horror from the hills



  but a few inexplicable and hence from
a scientific point of view unfortunate
occurrences were more than compensated
for by the archeological treasures that the
successful explorers brought back and
figuratively dumped at algernons feet
there were mirrors of grseco-baarian
design and miniature tiger-dragons or
tao-tiehs from central china dating from
at least  b c enormous diorite
sphinxes from the valley of the nile
geometric vases from mycenaean crete
incised pottery from messina and syra-
cuse linens and spindles from the swiss
lakes sculptured lintels from yucatan
and mexico mayan and manabi mono-
liths ten feet tall paleolithic venuses
from the rock caverns of the pyrenees
and even a series of rare bilingual tablets
in hamitic and latin from the site of
carthage

  it is not surprizing that so splendid a
     w t--

garnering should have elated algernon
immoderately and impelled him to be-
have like a schoolboy he addressed the
attendants by their first names slapped
them boisterously upon their shoulders
whenever they had occasion to approach
him and went roaming haphazardly
about the building immersed in ecstatic
reveries so far indeed did he descend
from his pedestal that even the directors
were disturbed and it is doubtful if any-
thing short of the arrival of clark ulman
could have jolted him out of it

  ulman may have been aware of this
for he telephoned first to break the news
mercifully he had apparently heard of
the success of the other expeditions and
hated infernally to intrude his skeleton at
the banquet algernon as we have seen
was humming and the jingling of a
phone-bell at his elbow was the first inti-
mation he had of ulmans return has-

a guard in the museum was
found dead in front of the
stone elephant


weird tales

tily detaching the receiver he pressed it
against his ear and injected a staccato
what is it into the mouthpiece

  there ensued a silence then ulmans
voice disconcertingly shrill smote un-
pleasantly upon his tympanum ive got
the god algernon and ill be over with
it directly ive three men helping me its
four feet high and as heavy as granite oh
its a strange loathsome thing algernon
an unholy thing i shall insist that you
destroy it

  whats that algernon raised his
voice incredulously

  you may photograph it and study it
but youve got to destroy it youll un-
derstand when you see what-what i
have become

  there came a hoarse sobbing whilst
algernon struggled to comprehend what
the other was driving at

  it has wreaked its malice on me-on

  with a frown algernon put up the
receiver and began agitatedly to pace the
room the elephant-god of tsang
he muttered to himself the horror
richardson drew before-before they im-
paled him its unbelievable ulman
has crossed the desert plateau on foot-
hes crossed above the graves of steel-
brath talman mcwilliams henley and
holmes richardson swore the cave was
guarded night and day by leprous yellow
abnormalities im sure thats the phrase
he used-abnormalities without faces-
fetid beast-men in thrall to some malign
wizardry he averred they moved in cir-
cles about the idol on their hands and
knees and participated in a rite so foul
that he dared not describe it

  his escape was a sheer miracle he
was a stout fellow it was merely be-
cause they couldnt kill him that the priest
was impressed a man who can curse
valiantly after three days of agonizing
torture must of necessity be a great magi-

cian and wonder-worker but it couldnt
have happened twice ulman could
never have achieved such a break he
is too frail-a day on their cross would
have finished him they would never
have released him and decked him out
with flowers and worshipped him as a
sort of subsidiary elephant-god richard-
son predicted that no other white man
would ever get into the cave alive and

as for getting out-

  i cant imagine how ulman did it
if he encountered even a few of rich-
ardsons beast-men it isnt surprizing he
broke down on the phone destroy the
statue imagine sheer insanity that
ulman is evidently in a highly nervous
and excitable state and we shall have to
handle him with gloves

there came a knock at the door

i dont wish to be disturbed
shouted algernon irritably

  weve got a package for you sir
the doorman said for us to bring it up
here

  oh all right ill sign for it

  the door swung wide and in walked
three shabbily dressed men staggering
beneath a heavy burden

  put it down there said algernon
indicating a spot to the rear of his desk

  the men complied with a celerity that
amazed him

  did mr ulman send you he de-
manded curtly

  yes sir the spokesmans face had
formed into a molding of relief the
poor gentleman said hed be here hisself
in half an hour

  algernon started why do you say
poor gentleman he demanded

  the spokesman shuffled his feet its
on account of his face sir theres
something wrong with it he keeps it
covered and wont let nobody look at it
the horror from the hills



  good god murmured algernon
theyve mutilated him

  whats that sir what did you
say

  algernon collected himself with an ef-
fort nothing you may go now
the doorman will give you a dollar ill
phone down and tell him to give you a
dollar

  silently the men filed out as soon
as the door closed behind them algernon
strode into the center of the room and
began feverishly to strip the wrappings
from the thing on the floor he worked
with manifest misgivings the distaste in
his eyes deepening to disgust and horror
as the loathly form came into view

  words can not adequately convey the
repulsiveness of the thing it was en-
dowed with a trunk and great uneven
ears and two enormous tusks protruded
from the corners of its mouth but it
was not an elephant it was not even
very closely analogous to an elephant
for the ears were webbed and tejvtacled
the trunk terminated in a huge flaring
disk at least a foot in diameter and the
tusks which intertwined and interlocked
at the base of the statue were as pellucid
as glass

  the pedestal upon which it squatted
was of black onyx the statue itself with
the exception of the tusks had appar-
ently been chiseled from a single block
of stone and was so hideously mottled
and eroded and discolored that it looked
in spots as though it had been dipped in
sanies

  the thing sat bolt upright its fore-
limbs were bent stiffly at the elbow and
its hands-it had human hands-rested
palms upward on its lap its shoulders
were broad and square and its breasts
and enormous stomach sloped outward
cushioning the trunk it was as quies-
cent as a buddha as enigmatical as a
sphinx and as malignantly poised as a

gorgon or cockatrice algernon could
not identify the stone out of which it had
been hewn and its greenish sheen dis-
turbed and puzzled him

  for a moment he stood staring uncom-
fortably into its little malign eyes then
he shivered and taking down a muffler
from the coat-rack in the corner he
cloaked securely the features which re-
pelled him

ulman arrived unannounced he ad-
vanced unobtrusively into the room
and laid a tremulous hand on algernons
shoulder well algernon how are
you he murmured i-im glad to
get back just to see-an old friend-
is a comfort i thought-but well it
doesnt matter i was going to ask-to
ask if you knew a good physician but
perhaps-i-i-

  startled algernon glanced backward
over his shoulder and straight into the
others eyes he saw only the eyes for
the rest of ulmans face was muffled by
a black silk scarf clark he ejacu-
lated by god sir but you gave me a
start

  rising quickly he sent his chair spin-
ning against the wall and gripped his
friend cordially by the shoulders it is
good to see you again clark he mur-
mured it is good-why what is the
matter

  ulman had fallen upon his knees and
was choking and gasping for breath

  i should have warned you-not to
touch me he moaned i cant stand
-being touched

 but why-

  the wounds havent healed he
sobbed it doesnt want them to heal
every night it comes and lays-the disk
on them i cant stand being touched

  algernon nodded sympathetically i
can imagine what youve been through
clark he said you must take a va-
 

weird tales

cation i shall have a talk with the di-
rectors about you tomorrow in view of
what youve done for us im sure i can
get you at least four months you can
go to spain and finish your glimpses into
pre-history paleontological anthropol-
ogy is a soothing science clark youll
forget all about the perplexities of mere
archeological research when you start
poking about among bones and artifacts
that havent been disturbed since the
pleistocence

  ulman had gotten to his feet and was
staring at the opposite wall

  you think that i have become-irre-
sponsible

  a look of sadness crept into alger-
nons eyes no clark i think you
are merely suffering from-from visual
hallucinations a heavy neurasthenia
you know can cause such illusions
and considering what youve been

through-

  what ive been through ulman
caught at the phrase would it inter-
est you to know precisely what they did
to me

  yes clark i wish to hear every-
thing

  they said that i must accompany
chaugnar faugn into the world
chaugnar faugn

  that is the name they worship it by
when i told them i had come from
america they said that great chaugnar
had willed that i should be his compan-
ion

   it must be carried they explained
and it must be nursed if it is nursed
and carried safely beyond the rising sun
it will possess the world and then all
things that are now in the world all
creatures and plants and stones will be
devoured by great chaugnar all things
that are and have been will cease to be
and great chaugnar will fill all space
with its oneness even its brothers it

will devour its brothers who will come
down from the mountains ravening for
ecstasy when it calls to them

  i didnt protest when they explained
this to me it was precisely the kind of
break i had been hoping for i had read
richardsons book you see and i had
gleaned enough between the lines to con-
vince me that chaugnar faugns devotees
were growing a little weary of it it
isnt a very pleasant deity to have around
it has some regrettable and very nasty
habits

  a horror was taking shape in ulmans

eyes

  you must excuse my levity when
one is tottering on the edge of an abyss
it isnt always expedient to dispense with
irony were i to become wholly serious
for a moment were i to let the-what i
believe what i know to be the truth be-
hind all that i am telling you coalesce in-
to a definite concept in my mind i should
go quite mad let us call them merely
regrettable habits

  i guessed as i say that the guardians
of the cave were not very enthusiastic
about retaining chaugnar faugn indef-
initely it made-depredations the
guardians would disappear in the night
and leave their clothes behind them and
the clothes upon examination would
yield something only remotely analogous

  but however much your savage may
want to dispose of his god the thing isnt
always feasible it would be the height
of folly to attempt to send an omnipotent
deity on a long journey without adequate
justification an angered god can take
vengeance even when he is on the oppo-
site side of the world and that is why
most barbarians who find themselves sad-
dled with a deity they fear and hate are
obliged to put up with it indefinitely

  the only thing that can help them is
a legend-some oral or written legend
that will enable them to send their ogre
the horror from the hills



packing without ruffling its temper the
devotees had such a legend at a cer-
tain time which the prophecy left grati-
fyingly indefinite chaugnar faugn was
to be sent out into the world it was to
be sent out to possess the world to its
everlasting glory and it was also written
that those who sent it forth should be
forever immune from its ire

  i knew of the existence of this legend
and when i read richardson and discov-
ered what a vile and unpleasant customer
the god was i decided id risk a trip
across the desert plateau of tsang
you crossed on foot interrupted
algernon with undisguised admiration

  there were no camels available as-
sented ulman  made it on foot on
the fourth day my water ran short and i
was obliged to open a vein in my arm
on the fifth day i began to see mirages-
probably of a purely hallucinatory na-
ture on the seventh day-he paused
and stared hard at algernon-on the
seventh day i consumed the excrements
of wild dogs

  algernon shuddered but you
reached the cave

  i reached the cave the-the face-
less guardians whom richardson de-
scribed found me groveling on the sands
in delirium a half-mile to the west of
their sanctuary they restored me by
heating a flint until it was white-hot and
laying it on my chest if the high priest
hadnt interfered i should have shared
richardsons fate

  good god

  the high priest was called chung ga
and he was devilishly considerate he
took me into the cave and introduced me
to chaugnar faugn

  youve chaugnar there ulman
pointed to the enshrouded form on the
floor and you can imagine what the
sight of it squatting malignly on its
haunches at the back of an evil-smelling

atrociously lighted cave would do to a
man who had not eaten for three days

  i began to say very queer things to
chung ga i confided to him that great
chaugnar faugn was not just a lifeless
statue in a cave but a great universal god
malignantly filling all space-that it had
created the world in a single instant by
merely expelling its breath and that
when eventually it decided to inhale the
world would disappear it also made
this cave i hastened to add and you
are its chosen prophet

  the priest stared at me curiously for
several moments without speaking then
he approached the god and prostrated
himself in ecstasy before it chaugnar
faugn he intoned the white acolyte
has confirmed that you are about to be-
come a great universal god filling all
space he will carry you safely into the
world and nurse you till you have no
further need of him the prophecy of
mu sang has been most gloriously ful-
filled

  for several minutes he remained
kneeling at the foot of the idol then
he rose and approached me you shall
depart with great chaugnar tomorrow
he said you shall become great
chaugnars companion and nurse

  i felt a wave of gratitude for the man
even in my befuddled state i was sensible
that i had achieved a magnificent break
i will serve him gladly i murmured if
only i may have some food

  chung ga nodded it is my wish
that you eat heartily he said if you
are to nurse great chaugnar you must
consume an infinite diversity of fruits
and the flesh of animals red blood-
red blood is chaugnars staff without
it my god would swoon would suffer
tortures unspeakable

  he tapped a drum and immediately i
was confronted with a wooden bowl filled
to the brim with pomegranate juice


weird tales

   drink heartily he urged i have
reason to suspect that chaugnar faugn
will be ravenous tonight

  i was so famished that i scarcely gave
a thought to what he was saying and for
fifteen minutes i consumed without dis-
crimination everything that was set be-
fore me-evil-smelling herbs ewes milk
eggs peaches and the fresh blood of an-
telopes

  the priest watched me in silence at
last when i could eat no more he went
into a corner of the cave and returned
with a straw mattress you have supped
most creditably he murmured and i
wish you pleasant dreams

  with that he withdrew and i crawled
gratefully upon the mat my strength
was wholly spent and the dangers i still
must face the loathsome proximity of
great chaugnar and the possibility that
the priest had been deliberately playing a
part and would return to kill me were
swallowed up in a physical urgency that
bordered on delirium relaxing upon
the straw i shut my eyes and fell almost
instantly into a deep sleep

t awoke with a start and a strange im-
a pression that i was not alone in the
cave even before i opened my eyes i
knew that something unspeakably malign
was crouching or squatting on the ground
beside me i could hear it panting in
the darkness and the stench of it stran-
gled the breath in my throat

  slowly very slowly i endeavored to
rise an unsurpassably ponderous weight
descended upon my chest and hurled me
to the ground i stretched out my hand
to disengage it and met with an iron re-
sistance a solid wall of something
cold slimy and implacable rose up in the
darkness to thwart me

  in an instant i was fully awake and
calling frantically for assistance but no
one came to me and even as i

screamed the wall descended perpendicu-
larly upon me and lay clammily upon my
chest an odor of corruption surged
from it and when i tore at it with my fin-
gers it made a low gurgling sound
which gradually increased in volume till
it woke echoes in the low-vaulted ceiling

  the thing had pinioned my arms and
the more i twisted and squirmed the
more agonizingly it tightened about me
the constriction increased until breath-
ing became a torture till all my flesh pal-
pitated with pain i wriggled and twist-
ed and bit my lips through in an ex-
tremity of horror

  then abruptly the pressure ceased
and i became aware of two corpsy viscid
eyes glaring truculently at me through the
darkness agonizingly i sat up and ran
my hands over my chest and arms a
warm wetness slithered through my fin-
gers and with a hideous clarity it was
borne in on me that the thing had been
supping on my blood the revelation
was mind-shattering with a shriek i
struggled to my feet and went careening
about the cavern

  a most awful terror was upon me
and so unreasoning became my desire to
escape from that fearsome vampirish
obscenity that i retreated straight toward
the throne of chaugnar faugn

  it loomed enormous in the darkness
a refuge and a sanctuary it occurred to
me that if i could scale the throne and
climb upon the lap of the god the horror
might cease to molest me foul and
fetid and malignant beyond belief it un-
doubtedly was but i refused to credit it
with more than animalistic intelligence
even in that moment of infinite peril as
i groped shakingly toward the rear of the
cave my mind was evolving a conceit to
account for it

  it was indubitably i told myself
some atavistic survival from the age of
reptiles-some fell and lumpish abnor-
the horror from the hills



mality that had experienced no necessity
to advance on the course of evolution it
is more than probable that all vertebrated
animals above the level of fishes and am-
phibians originated in asia and i had
recklessly conveyed myself to the hoariest
section of that detestable continent was
it after all so amazing that i should have
encountered in a dark and inaccessible
cave on a virtually uninhabited plateau
a reptilian blasphemy endowed with pro-
pensities as mysterious as they were ab-
horrent

  it was a comfortable conceit and it
sustained me till i reached the throne of
great chaugnar i fear that up to that
instant my obtuseness had been positively
idiotic there was only one really ade-
quate explanation for what had occurred
but not until i actually ascended the
throne and began to feel about in the
darkness for the body of chaugnar did
the truth rush in upon me

  great chaugnar had forsaken its
throne it had descended into the cave
and was roaming about in the darkness
in its execrable peregrinations it had
stumbled upon my sleeping form had
felled me with its trunk so that it might
detestably sup

  for an instant i crouched motionless
upon the stone with a cold horror gnaw-
ing at my vitals then quickly i began
to descend but i had not lowered more
than my right leg when something pon-
derous collided with the base of the
throne the entire structure quivered
and i was almost thrown to the ground

  i refuse to dwell on what happened
after that there are experiences too re-
volting for sane description were i to
tell how the horror began slobberingly
to mount to recount at length how it
heaved its slabby and mucid vastness to
the pinnacle of its throne and began
nauseatingly to breathe upon me the

doubts you now entertain as to my sanity
would coalesce into certainties

  neither shall i describe how it picked
me up in its nasty fetid hands and began
revoltingly to maul me and how i nearly
fainted beneath the foulness which
drooled from its mouth and descended
stickily upon me it is sufficient that
eventually it wearied of its malign sport
that after sinking its slimy black nails
into my throat chest and navel till i
shrieked in agony it experienced a sud-
den access of wrath and hurled me ven-
omously from the pedestal

  the fall stunned me and for many
minutes i lay on my back on the stones
dimly conscious only of a furtive whis-
pering in the void about me then
slowly my vision cleared and under the
guidance of some nebulous and sinister
influence my eyes were drawn upward
until they encountered the pedestal from
which i had fallen and the enormous
ropy bulk of chaugnar faugn loathsome-
ly waving his great trunk in the dawn

wtt isnt surprizing that when chung
a ga found me deliriously gibbering
at the caverns mouth he was obliged to
carry me into the sunlight and force great
wooden spoonfuls of revivifying wine
down my parched throat if there was
anything inexplicable in the sequel to that
hideous nightmare it was the matter-of-
fact reception which he accorded my
story

  he nodded his head sympathetically
when i recounted my experiences on the
throne and assured me that the incident
accorded splendidly with the prophecies
of mu sang i was afraid he said
that great chaugnar would not accept
you as its companion and nurse-that it
would destroy you as utterly as it has the
guardians-more of the guardians than
i would care to adumbrate

  he studied me for a moment intense-


weird tales

y no doubt you think me a supersti-
tious savage a ridiculous barbarian
would it surprize you very much if i
should confess to you that i have spent
eight years in england and that i am a
graduate of the university of london

  i could only stare at him in befud-
dled surprize so unbelievable and
ghastly had been the coming to life of
chaugnar faugn that lesser wonders
made little impression on me had he
told me that he had an eye in the middle
of his back or a tail twenty feet long
which he kept continuously coiled about
his body i should have evinced little sur-
prize i doubt indeed if anything short
of a universal cataclysm could have
roused me from my stupor

   it astonishes you perhaps that i
should have cast my lot with filthy primi-
tives in this loathsome place and that i
should have so uncompromisingly men-
aced your countrymen a wistfulness
crept into his eyes your richardson
was a brave man even chaugnar faugn
was moved to compassion by his valor
he gave no cry when we drove wooden
stakes through his hands and impaled
him for three days he defied us then
chaugnar tramped toward him in the
night and set him at liberty

   you may be sure that from that in-
stant we accorded him every considera-
tion but to return to what you would
undoubtedly call my perverse and atavis-
tic attitude why do you suppose i
chose to serve chaugnar

  his recapitulation of what he had
done to richardson had awakened in me
a confused resentment i dont know

i muttered you vile-

   spare me your opprobrium i beg of
you he exclaimed it was great
chaugnar speaking through me that dic-
tated the fate of richardson i am mere-
ly chaugnars interpreter and instrument
for generations my forebears have served

chaugnar and i have never attempted to
evade the duties that were delegated to
me when our world was merely a thought
in the mind of my god i went to eng-
land and acquired a little of the wests
decadent culture merely that i might
more worthily serve chaugnar

   dont imagine for a moment that
chaugnar is a beneficent god in the
west you have evolved certain amiabili-
ties of intercourse to which you pre-
sumptuously attach cosmic significance
such as truth kindliness generosity for-
bearance and honor and you quaintly im-
agine that a god who is beyond good and
evil and hence unamenable to your
ethics can not be omnipotent

   but how do you know that there are
any beneficent laws in the universe that
the cosmos is friendly to man even in
the mundane sphere of planetary life
there is nothing to sustain such an hypo-
thesis

   great chaugnar is a terrible god an
utterly cosmic and unanthropomorphic
god it is akin to the fire mists and the
primordial ooze and before it incarned
itself in time it contained within itself
the past the present and the future
nothing was and nothing will be but all
things are and chaugnar faugn was
once the sum of all things that are

  i remained silent and a note of com-
passion crept into his voice i think he
perceived that i had no inclination to
split hairs with him over the paradoxes
of transcendental metaphysics

   chaugnar faugn he continued
did not always dwell in the east many
thousands of years ago it abode with its
brothers in a cave in western europe
and made from the flesh of toads a race
of small dark shapes to serve it in bod-
ily contour these shapes resembled men
but they were incapable of speech and
their thoughts were the thoughts of
chaugnar
the horror from the hills 



   the cave where chaugnar dwelt
was never visited by men for it wound
its twisted length through a high and in-
accessible crag of the mysterious pyre-
nees and all the regions beneath were
rife with abominable hauntings

   twice a year chaugnar faugn sent
its servants into the villages that dotted
the foothills to bring it the sustenance its
belly craved the chosen youths and
maidens were preserved with spices and
stored in the cave till chaugnar had need
of them and in the villages men would
hurl their first-borns into the flames and
offer prayers to their futile little gods
hoping thereby to appease the wrath of
chaugnars mindless servants

   but eventually there came into the
foothills men like gods stout eagle-vis-
aged men who carried on their shields the
insignia of invincible rome they scaled
the mountains in pursuit of the servants
and awoke a cosmic foreboding in the
mind of chaugnar

    it is true that its brethren succeeded
without difficulty in exterminating the
impious cohorts-exterminating them un-
speakably-before they reached the cave
but it feared that rumors of the attempted
sacrilege would bring legions of the em-
pire-builders into the hills and that eventu-
ally its sanctuary would be defiled

  so in ominous conclave it debated
with its brothers the advisability of flight
rome was but a dream in the mind of
chaugnar and it could have destroyed her
utterly in an instant but having incarned
itself in time it did not wish to resort to
violence until the prophecies were ful-
filled

    chaugnar and its brothers conversed
by means of thought-transference in an
idiom incomprehensible to us and it
would be both dangerous and futile to at-
tempt to repeat the exact substance of
their discourse but it is recorded in the

prophecy of mu sang that great chaug-
nar spoke approximately as follows

  our servants shall carry us east-
ward to the primal continent and there
we shall await the arrival of the white
acolyte

   his brothers demurred we are
safe here they affirmed no one will
scale the mountains again for the doom
that came to pompelo will reverberate in
the dreams of prophets till rome is less
to be feared than moon-dim nineveh or
medusa-girdled ur

   at that great chaugnar waxed ire-
ful and affirmed that it would go alone
to the primal continent leaving its broth-
ers to cope with the menace of rome
when the time-frames are dissolved i
alone shall ascend in glory it told them
all of you i shall devour before i as-
cend to the dark altars when the hour
of my transfiguration approaches you will
come down from the mountains cosmical-
ly athirst for that which is not to be
spoken of but even as your bodies raven
for the time-dissolving sacrament i shall
consume them

    then it called for the servants and
had them carry it to this place and it
caused mu sang to be born from the
womb of an ape and the prophecies to be
written on imperishable parchment and
into the care of my fathers it surrendered
its body

  i rose gropingly to my feet let me
leave this place i pleaded chaugnar
has supped upon my blood and has sure-
ly no further need of me

  chung gas features were convulsed
with pity it is stated in the prophecy
that you must be chaugnars companion
and accompany it to america in a few
days it will experience a desire to feed
again you must nurse it unceasingly
 i am ill i pleaded i can not
carry chaugnar faugn across the desert
plateau


weird tales

   i will have the guardians assist you
murmured chung ga soothingly you
shall be conveyed in comfort to the gates
of lhasa and from lhasa to the coast it
is less than a weeks journey by caravan

t realized then how impossible it
a would be for me to depart without
great chaugnar very well chung
ga i said i submit to the prophecy
chaugnar shall be my companion and i
shall nurse it as diligently as it desires
there was a ring of insincerity in my
speech which was not lost on chung ga
he approached very close to me and
peered into my eyes if you attempt to
dispose of my god he warned its
brothers will come down from the moun-
tains and tear you indescribably

  he saw perhaps that i wasnt wholly
convinced for he added in a more om-
inous tone it has laid upon you the
mark and seal of a flesh-dissolving sacra-
ment destroy it and the sacrament will-
be consummated in an instant the flesh
of your body will turn black and melt
like tallow in the sun you will become
a seething mass of corruption a fetid and
frenzied abnormality 

  ulman paused to clear his throat
there isnt much more to my story al-
gernon the guardians carried us safely
to lhasa and a fortnight later i reached
the bay of bengal accompanied by half
a hundred scabrous and filthy beggars
from the temples of the loathliest cities
in india there was something about
our caravan that had attracted them and
all during the voyage from bengal to
hongkong the indian and tibetan mem-
bers of our crew would steal stealthily to
my cabin at night and fight with one an-
other for the privilege of pressing their
repellent physiognomies against the shut-
tered panes

  dont imagine for a moment that i
didnt share their superstitious awe of the

thing i was compelled to companion
continuously i longed to carry it on deck
and cast it into the sea only the mem-
ory of chung gas warning and the
thought of what might happen to me if i
disregarded it kept me chained and sub-
missive

  it was not until weeks later when i
had left the indian and most of the pa-
cific ocean behind me that i discovered
how unwise i had been to heed his vile
threats if i had resolutely hurled
chaugnar into the sea the shame and the
horror might never have come upon me

  ulmans voice was rising becoming
shrill and hysterical chaugnar faugn is
an awful and mysterious being a repel-
lent and obscene and lethal being but
how do i know that it is omnipotent
chung ga may have maliciously lied to
me chaugnar faugn may be merely an
extension or distortion of inanimate na-
ture some hideous process as yet unob-
served and unexplained by the science of
the west may be noxiously at work in
desert places all over our planet to pro-
duce such fiendish anomalies perhaps
parallel to protoplasmic life on the earths
crust is this other aberrant and hidden
life-the revolting sentiency of stones
that aspire of earth-shapes parasitic and
bestial that wax agile in the presence of
man

  did not cuvier believe that there had
been not one but an infinite number of
creations and that as our earth cooled
after its departure from the sun a succes-
sion of vitalic phenomena appeared on its
surface conceding as we must the or-
derly and continuous development of
protoplasmic life from simple forms
which cuvier stupidly and ridiculously
denied is it not still conceivable that an-
other evolutionary cycle may have pre-
ceded the one which has culminated in
us a non-protoplasmic cycle

  whether we accept the laplacian or
the horror from the hills



the planetesimal theory of planetary for-
mation it is permissible to believe that the
earth coalesced very swiftly into a com-
pact mass after the segregation of its con-
stituents in space and that it achieved suf-
ficient crustal stability to support animate
entities one or two or perhaps even five
billion years ago

  i do not claim that life as we know it
would be possible in the earliest phases of
planetary consolidation but is it possible
to assert dogmatically that beings pos-
sessed of intelligence and volition could
not have evolved in a direction merely
parallel to the cellular life as we know
it is complexly bound up with such sub-
stances as chlorophyll and protoplasm
but does that preclude the possibility of
an evolved sentiency in other forms of
matter

  how do we know that stones can not
think that the earth beneath our feet may
not once have been endowed with a hid-
eous intelligence entire cycles of animate
evolution may have occurred on this
planet before the most primitive of liv-
ing cells were evolved from the slime
of warm seas

  there may have been eons of-ex-
periments three billion years ago in the
fiery radiance of the rapidly condensing
earth who knows what monstrous shapes
crawled-or shambled

  and how do we know that there are
not survivals or that somewhere be-
neath the stars of heaven complex and
hideous processes are not still at work
shaping the inorganic into forms of pri-
mal malevolence

  and what more inevitable than that
some such primiparous spawn should
have become in my eyes the apotheosis of
all that was fiendish and accursed and un-
clean and that i should have ascribed to
it the attributes of divinity and imagined
in a moment of madness that it was im-

mune to destruction i should have hurled
it into the depths of the seas and risked
boldly the fulfilment of chung gas pro-
phecy for even had it proved itself
omnipotent and omnificent by rising in
fury from the waves or summoning its
brothers to bemire me i should have suf-
fered merely indescribably for an in-
stant

  ulmans voice had risen to a shrill
scream i should have passed quickly
enough into the darkness had i encoun-
tered merely the wrath of chaugnar
faugn it was not the fury but the for-
bearance of chaugnar that has wrought
an uncleanliness in my bodys flesh and
blackened and shriveled my soul till a
furious hate has grown up in me for all
that the world holds of serenity and joy

  ulmans voice broke and for a moment
there was silence in the room then with
a sudden convulsive movement of his
right arm he uncloaked the whole of his
face

  he was standing very nearly in the
center of the office and the light from
its eastern window illumed with a hid-
eous clarity all that remained of his fea-
tures but algernon didnt utter a sound
for all that the sight was appalling
enough to revolt a corpse he simply
clung shakingly to the desk and waited
with ashen lips for ulman to continue

  it came to me again as i slept drink-
ing its fill and in the morning i woke to
find that the flesh of my body had grown
fetid and loathsome and that my face-
my face-

  yes clark i understand alger-
nons voice was vibrant with compassion
ill get you some brandy

  ulmans eyes shone with an awful
light

  do you believe me he cried do
you believe that chaugnar faugn has
wrought this uncleanliness


weird tales

  slowly algernon shook his head no
clark chaugnar faugn is nothing but
an obscene stone fetish i believe that
chung ga kept you under the influence
of some potent drug until he had-had
cut your face and that he also mesmer-
ized you and suggested every detail of
the story you have just told me i be-
lieve you are still actually under the spell
of that mesmerization

  when i boarded the ship at calcutta
there was nothing wrong with my face
shrilled ulman

  conceivably not but some minion
of the priest may have administered the
drug and performed the operation on
shipboard i can only guess at what hap-
pened of course but it is obvious that
you are the victim of some hideous char-
latanry ive visited india clark and i
have a very keen respect for the hypnotic
endowments of the oriental its ghast-
ly and unbelievable how much a hindoo
or a tibetan can accomplish by simple
suggestion

  i feared-i feared that you would
doubt ulmans voice had risen to a

shriek but i swear to you-

  the sentence was never finished a
hideous pallor overspread the archeolo-
gists face his jaw sagged and into his
eyes there crept a look of panic fright
for a second he stood clawing at his
throat like a man in the throes of an
epileptic fit

  then something some invisible force
seemed to propel him backward choking
and gasping he staggered against the wall
and threw out his arms in a gesture of
frantic appeal keep it off he sobbed

i cant breathe i cant-

  with a cry algernon leapt forward
but before he could reach the others side
the unfortunate man had sunk to the
floor and was moaning and gibbering and
rolling about in a most sickening way

	the atrocity at the museum

algernon harris emerged from the
-b m t subway at the fifty-ninth
street and fifth avenue entrance and be-
gan nervously to pace the sidewalk in front
of a large yellow sign which bore the dis-
couraging caption buses do not stop
here harris was most eager to secure a
bus and it was obvious from the expec-
tant manner in which he hailed the first
one to pass that he hadnt the faintest
notion he had taken up his post on the
wrong side of the street indeed it was
not until four buses had passed him by
that he awoke to the gravity of his pre-
dicament and began to propel his person
in the direction of the legitimate stop-
zone

  algernon harris was abnormally and
tragically upset but even a man trem-
bling on the verge of a neuropathic col-
lapse can remain superficially politic and
it isnt surprizing that when he ascended
into his bus and encountered on a con-
spicuous seat his official superior doctor
george francis scollard he should have
nodded smiled and responded with an
unwavering amiability to the questions
that were shot at him

  i got your telegram yesterday mur-
mured the president of the manhattan
museum of fine arts and i caught the
first train down am i too late for the in-
quest

  algernon nodded the coroner-a
chap named henry weigal-took my
evidence and rendered a decision on the
spot the condition of ulmans body
would not have permitted of delay i
never before imagined that-that putre-
faction could proceed with such incred-
ible rapidity

  scollard frowned and the verdict

  heart failure the coroner was very
positive that anxiety and shock were the
sole causes of ulmans lethal collapse
the horror from the hills



  but you said something about his face
being horribly disfigured

  yes it had been rendered loathsome
by-by plastic surgery weigal was hid-
eously agitated until i explained that
ulman had merely fallen into the hands
of a skilful oriental surgeon with sadistic
inclination in the course of his investi-
gatory peregrinations i explained to him
that many of our field workers returned
slightly disfigured and that ulman had
merely endured an exaggeration of the
customary martyrdom

  and you believe that plastic surgery
could account for the repellent and grue-
some changes you mentioned in your
night-letter - the shocking prolongation
of the poor devils nose the flattening

and broadening of his ears-

  algernon winced i must believe it
sir it is impossible to entertain any other
explanation sanely the coroners assist-
ant was a little incredulous at first until
weigal pointed out to him what an un-
wholesome precedent they would set by
even so much as hinting that the phenom-
enon wasnt pathologically explicable
we would play right into the hands of
the spiritualists weigal explained an
officer of the police isnt at liberty to ad-
duce an hypothesis that the district attor-
neys office wouldnt approve of the
newspapers would pounce on a thing like
that and play it up disgustingly mr har-
ris has supplied us with an explanation
which seems adequately to cover the facts
and with your permission i shall file a
verdict of natural death 

  the president coughed and shifted un-
easily in his seat i am glad that the
coroner took such a sensible view of the
matter had he been a recalcitrant indi-
vidual and raised objections we should
have come in for considerable unpleasant
publicity i shudder whenever i see a ref-
erence to the museum in the popular
press it is always the morbid and sensa-

tional aspects of our work that they stress
and there is never the slightest attention
paid to accuracy

  for a moment doaor scollard was si-
lent then he cleared his throat and
recapitulated in a slightly more emphatic
form the question that he had put to
algernon originally but you said in
your letter that ulmans nose revolted
and sickened you-that it had become a
loathsome greenish trunk almost a foot
in length which continued to move about
for hours after ulmans heart stopped
beating could-could your operation
hypothesis account for such an appalling
anomaly

  algernon took a deep breath i cant
pretend that i wasnt astounded and ap-
palled and-and frightened and so lost
to discretion that i made no attempt to
conceal my perturbation from the cor-
oner i could not remain in the room
while they were examining the body
and yet you succeeded in convincing
the coroner that he could justifiably ren-
der a verdia of natural death

  you misunderstood me sir the cor-
oner wanted to render such a verdia my
explanation merely supplied him with a
straw to clutch at i was trembling in
every limb when i made it and it must
have been obvious to him that we were
in the presence of something unthinkable
but without the plastic surgery assump-
tion we should have had nothing what-
ever to cling to

  and do you still give your reluaant
assent to such an assumption

  now more than ever and my assent
is no longer reluaant for ive succeeded
in convincing myself that a surgeon en-
dowed with miraculous skill could have
affeaed the transformation i described in
my letter

  miraculous skill

  i use the word in a merely mundane
sense when one stops to consider what


weird tales

astounding advances plastic surgery has
made in england and america during the
past decade it is impossible to disbelieve
that the human frame will soon become
more malleable than wax beneath the
scalpels of our surgeons and that beings
will appear in our midst with bodies so
grotesquely distorted that the superstitious
will ascribe their advent to the supernat-
ural

  and we can adduce more than a sur-
gical miracle to account for the horror
that poor ulman became without for a
moment encroaching on the dubious do-
main of the super-physical every one
knows how extensively the ductless
glands regulate the growth and shape of
our bodies a change in the quantity or
quality of secretion in any one of the
glands may throw the entire human
mechanism out of gear terrible and un-
thinkable changes have been known to
occur in the adult body during the course
of diseases involving glandular instabil-
ity we once thought that human beings
invariably ceased to grow at twenty-one
or twenty-two but we now know that
growth may continue till middle age and
even till the very onset of senility and
that frequently such growth does not cul-
minate in a mere increase in stature or in
girth

  doubtless you have heard of that rare
and mysterious malady known as acro-
megaly i believe that authorities differ
as to its precise causation some holding
that it can be traced to a thyroid and
others to a pituitary disturbance but we
know at any rate that it is basically a
glandular disease of unsurpassable malig-
nancy it is characterized by an abnormal
growth of the skull and face and occa-
sionally of the extremities and its vic-
tims become in a short time no longer
recognizably human the face swells and
distends and becomes a monstrous carica-
ture and the skull elongates and widens

till it dwarfs the dimensions of macro-
cephaly in exceptional cases the face has
been known to attain a length of nearly a
foot but it is not so much the size as the
revolting shape of the face which sets the
victims of this hideous disease so tragic-
ally apart from their fellows the fea-
tures not only grow but they assume a
repellent ape-like cast and as the disease
advances even the skull waxes revoltingly
simian in its conformation in brief the
victims of acromegaly become in a short
while almost indistinguishable from very
primitive and brutish types of human an-
cestors such as homo neandertalensis and
the unmentionable enormous-browed car-
icature from broken hill rhodesia
which sir arthur keith has called the
most unqualifiedly repulsive physiognomy
in the entire gallery of fossil men

  the disease of acromegaly is perhaps
a more certain indication of mans origin
than all the missing links that anthro-
pologists have exhumed it proves incon-
testably that we still carry within our
bodies the mechanism of evolutionary ret-
rogression and that when something in-
terferes with the normal functioning of
our glands we are very apt to return at
least physically to our aboriginal status

  and since we know that a mere in-
sufficiency or superabundance of glandu-
lar secretions can work such devastating
changes can turn men virtually into
neandertalers or great apes what is there
really unaccountable in die alteration i
witnessed in poor ulman

  some oriental diabolist merely ten
years in advance of the west in the sphere
of plastic surgery and with a knowledge
of glandular therapeutics no greater than
that possessed by doctors noel paton and
schafer might easily have wrought such
an abomination or suppose as i have
hinted before hat no surgery was in-
volved suppose this fiend has learned so
much about our glands that he can send
the horror from the hills



men back and back through the mists of
time-back past the great apes and the
feral marsupials and the loathsome saur-
ians to their primordial sires suppose-
it is an awful thought i know-suppose
that something remotely analogous to
what ulman became was once our ances-
tor that a hundred million years ago a
loathly batrachian shape with trunk-like
appendages and great flapping ears pad-
died obscenely through the warm pri-
meval seas or stretched its fetid length on
banks of permian slime

mr scollard turned sharply and
plucked at his subordinates sleeve
theres a crowd in front of the mu-
seum he muttered see there

   algernon started and rising instantly
pressed the signal bell above his compan-
ions head well have to walk back
he muttered despondently i should
have watched the street numbers

  his pessimism proved well-founded
the bus continued relentlessly on its way
for four additional blocks and then came
so abruptly to a stop that mr scollard
was subjected to the ignominy of being
obliged to sit for an instant on the spa-
cious lap of an ethiopian domestic

  ive a good mind to report you he
shouted to the bus conductor as he low-
ered his portly person to the sidewalk

ive a damn good mind-

  hush algernon laid a pacifying
arm on his companions arm weve
got no time to argue something dread-
ful has occurred at the museum i just
saw two policemen enter the building
and those tall men walking up and down
on the opposite side of the street are re-
porters theres wells of the tribune

and thompson of the times and-

   mr scollard gripped his subordinates
arm tell me he demanded did you
put the-the statue on exhibition
algernon nodded i had it carried to

alcove k wing c last night after the
inquest on poor ulman i was besieged by
reporters they wanted to know all about
the fetish and of course i had to tell them
that it would go on exhibition eventually
they would have returned every day for
weeks to pester me if i hadnt assured them
that the million-headed beast would be
given an opportunity to gibber and gape
at it

  yesterday afternoon all the papers ran
specials about it the news-graphic gave
it a front-page write-up i remained at
my office until eleven and all evening at
half-minute intervals some boob would
ring up and ask me when i was going to
exhibit the thing and whether it really
looked as repulsive as its photographs
and what kind of stone it was made of
and-oh god i was too nervous and
wrought-up to be bothered that way and
i decided it would be best to satisfy the
publics idiotic curiosity by permitting
them to view the thing today

  the two men were walking briskly in
the direction of the museum

  besides there was no longer any ne-
cessity of my keeping it in the office i
had had it measured and photographed
and i knew that harrison and smithstone
wouldnt want to take a cast of it until
next week and i couldnt have chosen
a safer place for it than alcove k its
roped off you know and only two paces
removed from the door cinney can see
it all night from his station in the corri-
dor

  by the time that algernon and mr
scollard arrived at the museum the crowd
had reached alarming proportions they
were obliged to fight their way aggres-
sively through a solid phalanx of mum-
bling boobs and submit for fully fifteen
minutes to appalling encroachments on
their personal dignity and even in the
vestibules they were repulsed with dis-
courtesy


weird tales

  a red-headed policeman glared sav-
agely at them from behind horn-rimmed
spectacles and arrested their progress with
a threatening gesture youve got to
keep out he shouted if you aint got
a police card youve got to keep out
whats happened here demanded
algernon authoritatively

  a guys been bumped off if you

aint got a police card youve got to-

  algernon produced a calling-card and
thrust it into the officers face im the
curator of archeology he affirmed an-
grily i guess ive a right to enter my own
museum

  the officers manner softened percep-
ibly then i guess its all right buddy
the chief told me i wasnt to keep out
any of the guys that work here how
about your friend

  you can safely admit him mur-
mured algernon with a smile hes
president of the museum

  oh yeh the policeman regarded
mr scollard dubiously for a moment
then he shrugged his shoulders and
stepped complacently aside i guess its
all right buddy he repeated senten-
tiously the chief didnt say anything
about presidents but i guess you can both
go in

  an attendant greeted them excitedly as
they emerged from the turnstile its
awful sir he gasped addressing mr
scollard cinney has been murdered-
knifed sir hes all cut and mangled i
shouldnt have recognized him if it
werent for his clothes theres nothing
left of his face sir

  algernon turned pale when-when
did this happen he gasped

  the attendant shook his head i
cant say mr harris it mustve been
some time last night but i cant say ex-
actly when the first we knew of it was
when mr williams came running down
the stairs with his hands all bloodied

that was at eight this morning about
two hours ago id just got in and all
the other attendants were in the cloak
room getting into their uniforms that
is all except williams williams usually
arrives about a half-hour before the rest
of us he likes to come early and have
a chat with cinney before the doors
open

  the attendants face was convulsed
with terror and he spoke with consider-
able difficulty i was the only one to see
him come down the stairs i was stand-
ing about here and as soon as he came
into sight i knew that something was
wrong with him he went from side to
side of the stairs and clung to the rails
to keep himself from falling and his
face was as white as paper

  algernons eyes did not leave the at-
tendants face go on he urged

  he opened his mouth very wide when
he saw me it was like as if he wanted
to shout and couldnt there wasnt a
sound came out of him

  the attendant cleared his throat i
didnt think hed ever reach the bottom
of the stairs and i called out for the boys
in the cloak room to lend me a hand
what happened then

  he didnt speak for a long time one
of the boys gave him some whisky out of
a flask and the rest of us just stood about
and said soothing things to him but he
was trembling all over and we couldnt
quiet him down he kept throwing his
head about and pointing toward the
stairs and foam collected all over his
mouth it was awful-minded me of a
dog with rabies

   whats wrong jim i said to him
what did you see

   the worm of hell he shrieked
the devils awful mascot he said
things i cant repeat sir horrible im-
pious things im a god-fearing man
sir and there are blasphemies i darent

                    w t-
the horror from the hills



soil my mouth with but ill tell you
what he said when he got through talk-
ing about the worm out of hell he said
gnneys upstairs rottin on his belly and
there aint a drop of blood in his veins
we got up the stairs quicker than
lightning after hed told us that we
didnt know just what his crazy words
meant but the blood on his hands made
them seem awful important they kind
of confirmed what we feared sir if you
get what i mean

  algernon nodded and you found
cinney-dead

  worse than that sir all black and
shrunken and looking as though hed
been wearing clothes about four sizes too
large for him his face was all gone sir
-all eaten away like we picked him
up-he wasnt much heavier than a little
boy-and laid him out on a bench in cor-
ridor h i never seen so much blood in
my life-the floor was all slippery with
it and the big stone animal you had us
carry down to alcove k last night was
all dripping with it specially its trunk
it made me sort of sick i never like to
look at blood

  you think some one attacked cin-
ney

  it looked that way mr harris like
as if some one went for him with a knife
it must have been an awful big knife-a
regular butchers knife that aint a very
nice way of putting it sir but thats how
it struck me like as if some one mistook
him for a piece of mutton

  and what else did you find when you
examined him

  we didnt do much examining we
just let him lie on the bench till we got
through phoning for the police mr wil-
liamson did the talking sir a look of
relief crept into the attendants eyes the
police said we wasnt to disturb the body
further which suited us fine there
w t-

  wasnt one of us didnt want to give poor
mr cinney a wide berth

  and what did the police do when they
arrived

  asked us about a million crazy ques-
tions sir was mr cinney disfigured in
the war and was mr cinney in the
habit of wearing a mask over his face
and had mr gnney received any threat-
ening letters from chinaman or hindoos
and when we told them no they seemed
to get kind of frightened if it aint mur-
der they said were up against some-
thing that aint natural but its got to
be murder all we have to do is get hold
of the chinaman

  algernon didnt wait to hear more
brushing the attendant ungratefully aside
he went dashing up the stairs three steps
at a time mr scollard followed with
ashen face

they were met in the upper corridor
by a tall loose-jointed man in shab-
by ill-fitting clothes who arrested their
progress with a scowl and a torrent of im-
patient abuse where do you think
youre going he demanded didnt i
give orders that no one was to come up
here ive got nothing to say to you
youre too damn nosy if you want the
lowdown on this affair youve got to wait
outside till we get through putting the at-
tendants on the grill

  see here said algernon impatiently
this gentleman is president of the mu-
seum and he has a perfect right to go
where he chooses

  the tall man waxed apologetic i
thought you were a couple of newspaper
johns he murmured confusedly we
havent anything even remotely resem-
bling a clue but those guys keep popping
in here every ten minutes to cross-examine
us theyre worse than prosecuting attor-
neys come right this way sir

  he led them past a little knot of at-


weird tales

tendants and photographers and finger-
print experts to the northerly part of the
corridor theres the body he said
pointing toward a sheeted form which lay
sprawled on a low bench near the win-
dow id be grateful if you gentlemen
would just take a squint at the poor lads
face

  algernon nodded and lifting a corner
of the sheet peered for an instant intently
into what remained of poor cinneys
countenance then with a shudder he
surrendered his place to mr scollard

  it is to mr scollards credit that he
did not cry out only the trembling of his
lower lip betrayed the revulsion which
filled him

  he was found on the floor in the cor-
ridor about two hours ago explained
the detective but the guy who found
him isnt here theyve got him in a
strait jacket down at belleview and it
doesnt look as though hell be much help
to us he was yelling his head off about
something he said came out of hell when
they put him in the ambulance thats
what drew the crowd

  you dont think williams could have
done it murmured algernon

  not a chance but he saw the mur-
derer all right and if we can get him to

talk- he wheeled on algernon

abruptly you seem to know something
about this sir

  only what we picked up downstairs
we had a talk with one of the attendants
and he explained about williams-and
the chinaman

  the detectives eyes glowed the
chinaman what chinaman is there a
chinaman mixed up in this its what
ive been thinking all along but i didnt
have much to go on

  i fear were becoming involved in a
vicious circle said algernon it was
your chinaman i was referring to willy
said you were laboring under the impres-

sion that all you had to do to solve this
distressing affair was to catch a china-
man

  the detective shook his head it
aint so simple as that he affirmed we
havent any positive evidence that a
chinaman did it it might have been a
jap or hindoo or even a south sea
islander that is if south sea islanders
eat rice

  rice algernon stared at the detec-
tive incredulously

  yeh in a bowl with long sticks im
no authority on et-etemalogy but its
my guess they dont use chopsticks much
outside of asia

  he went into alcove k and returned
with a wooden bowl and two long splin-
ters of wood all those dark spots near
the rim are blood stains he explained
as he surrendered the gruesome exhibits
to algernon even the rice is all smeared
with blood its nasty-looking gooey--
the kind of stuff a yellow ripper would
fill his guts with

  algernon shuddered and passed the
bowl to scollard who almost dropped it
in his haste to return it to the detective

  where did you find it the president
spoke in a subdued whisper

  on the floor in front of the big stone
elephant thats where the murder was
pulled off theres blood all over the ele-
phant- if its supposed to be an ele-
phant

   it isnt strictly speaking an elephant
said algernon

  yeh well whatever it is it could
tell us what cinneys murderer looked
like id give the toes off my left foot if
it could talk

  it doesnt talk said algernon de-
cisively

  i wasnt wisecracking admonished
the detective i was simply pointing out
that that elephant could give us the low-
down on a mighty nasty murder
the horror from the hills



  algernon accepted the rebuke in si-
lence

  there aint no doubt whatever that a
chinaman or hindoo or some crazy for-
eigner sneaked in here last night set him-
self down in front of that elephant and
began eating rice maybe he was in a
church-going mood and mistook the beast
for one of his heathen gods it kind of
looks like a heathen statue-like one of
those grinnin buddhas they put in all the
windows at van tines

  algernon smiled ironically but un-
questionably unique he murmured

  yeh larger and uglier-looking but
a heathen statue for all that i bet it actu-
ally was worshipped once

   yes admitted algernon it is indu-
bitably in the religious tradition for all
its hideousness it has all the earmarks of
a quiescent eastern divinity

  there aint anything more dangerous
than interfering with an oriental when
hes saying his prayers continued the de-
tective ive been in chinktown raids and
i know now heres what i think hap-
pened cinney is standing in the corridor
and suddenly he hears the chinaman mut-
tering and mumbling to himself in the
dark hes naturally frightened and so
he rushes in with his pocket light where
an angel would be fearing to tread the
light gets in the chinks eyes and sets him
off

   its like putting a matdi to a ton of
tnt to throw a light on a chink when
hes squatting in the dark in a worshipful
mood so the chink goes for the poor kid
with a knife a white man would have
made a quick job of it but you cant
count on what a chink will do when
something frightens and upsets him
theyre a cruel unreasoning race the
cutting mutilating impulse is in their
blood its a sort of second nature with
them to want to torture people and if
something prevents them from getting

back at you when you set them off theyll
do a hari-kari before your eyes ive
watched them try it a crazy mad crew
and hindoos are just as bad if it aint
a chinaman its got to be a hindoo
algernon nodded impatiently there
may be something in your theory ser-
geant but theres a great deal it doesnt
explain what was it that williams
saw

  nothing but cinney lying dead in the
corridor nothing but gnney looking up
at him without a face and that awful
heathen animal looking down at him with
blood all over its mouth

  algernon stared blood on its
mouth

  sure all over its mouth trunk and
tusks never seen so mudi blood in my
life thats what williams saw i dont
wonder it crumpled the kid up

there was a commotion in the corri-
dor some one was sobbing and
pleading in a most fantastic way a few
yards from where the three men were
standing the detective turned and
shouted out a curt command whoever
that is bring him here

  came an appalling ear-harassing
shriek and two plain-clothes men emerged
around a bend in the corridor with a di-
minutive and weeping oriental spread-
eagled betwixt their extended arms

  the chinaman muttered scollard in
amazement

  for a second the detective was too
startled to move and his immobility
somehow emboldened the chink to break
from his captors and prostrate himself on
the floor at algernons feet

  you are my friend he sobbed you
are a very good man i saw you in green-
fire dream in dream when big green
animals came down from mountain i saw
you and gautama siddhartha big green
animals all wanted blood-all very much


weird tales

wanted blood in dream gautama sidd-
hartha said they want you they have
determined they make you all dark fire
glue

  i said no please i said then gau-
tama siddhartha let fall jewel of wisdom
go to museeum go to big museeum
round block and big green animal will
eat you quick he will not make you dark
fire glue he will eat you quick-before
he make american man dark fire glue
all night i have sat here all night
i said eat me please but big green
animal slept till american man came
then he moved very quickly he moved
he gave american man very bad hug
american man screamed and big green
animal drank all american mans blood
the chinaman was sobbing unrestrain-
edly algernon stooped and lifted him
gently to his feet what is your name
he asked to soothe him where do you
live

im boss big laundry down street
murmured the chinaman my name is
hsieh ho i am a good man like you
where did you go when-when the
elephant came to life

  the chinamans lower lip trembled
convulsively i hid back of big white
lady

  in spite of the gravity of the situation
algernon couldnt repress a smile the
big white lady was a statue of venus
erycine and so enormous was it that it
occupied almost the whole of alcove k
it was a perfect sanctuary but there was
something ludicrously incongruous in a
chinamans seeking refuge in such a
place

  one of the detectives however con-
firmed the absurdity thats why we
found him sir he was lying on his back
wailing and groaning and making faces
at the ceiling hes our man all right
well have the truth out of him in ten
minutes

  the chief sergeant nodded you bet
we will put the bracelets on him jim
chinks are wormy customers

  reluctantly algernon surrendered
hsieh ho to his captors i suggest you
treat him kindly he said he had the
misfortune to witness a ghastly and un-
precedented exaggeration of what ed-
dington would call the random element in
nature but hes as destitute of criminal
proclivities as mr scollard here

  the detective raised his eyebrows i
dont get it sir are you suggesting we
aint to put him on the grill

  algernon nodded if you try any of
your revolting third-degree tactics on that
poor little man youll answer in court to
my lawyer now if you dont mind ill
have a look at alcove k

  the detective scowled he wanted to
tell algernon to go to hell but somehow
the inflection of authority in the latters
voice glued the invective to his tongue
and with a surly shrug he escorted the
group into the presence of chaugnar
faugn

sanguinary baptism becomes some
gods were the gracious figures of
the grecian pantheon to appear to us
with blood upon their garments we
should recoil in horror but we should
think the terrible mithra or the heart-
devouring huitzilopochtli a trifle un-
convincing if they came on our dreams
unbespattered with the ruddy vintage of
sacrifice not that great chaugnar desti
tute of gore had seemed unconvincing it
was so hideous in all truth that no blood
was needed to proclaim its inherent
malignancy but now it seemed more than
malign it was as though some dark hid-
den horror of inner earth had come up
from its foul lair with all its feastings ig-
nobly clinging to the hair about its
mouth it was as though the hyena had
shouldered its kill as though the vulture
the horror from the hills



had gone flapping through the sky with
all its glut dispersed in vomit on its loath-
some breast

   algernon did not at first look directly
at chaugnar faugn at first he studied
the tiled marble floor about the base of
the idol and tried to make out in the
gloom the precise spot where cinney had
lain the attempt proved confusing
there were dark smudges on almost every
other tile and they were nearly all of equal
circumference

  right there is where we found the
corpse said the detective impatiently
right beneath the trunk of the elephant
algernons blood ran cold slowly
very slowly for he feared to confront
what stood before him he raised his eyes
until they were level with the detectives
shoulders the detectives shoulders con-
cealed a portion of chaugnar faugn but
all of the things right side and the ex-
tremity of its trunk were hideously visible
to algernon as he stared he spoke no
word he did not even move but all of
the blood drained out of his lips and left
them purple

   mr scollard was staring at his subor-
dinate with frightened eyes you aa as
though - as though - good god man
what is it

  it has moved its trunk algernons
voice was vibrant with horror it has
moved its trunk since-since yesterday
and most hideously i can not be mis-
taken yesterday it was vertical-today it
is bent at an angle of forty-five degrees
mr scollard gasped he felt an appal-
ling horror churning and fussing at the
back of his head are you sure he
muttered are you wholly certain that
the trunk wasnt upraised when the god
arrived here

  yes yes until today in the ex-
citement no one has noticed it but if you
will call the attendants-wait

  the president had started to do that

very thing but algernons admonition
brought him up short i shouldnt have
suggested that he murmured in scol-
lards ear the attendants mustnt be
questioned its all too unutterably
ghastly and inexplicable and-and mad
weve got to keep it out of the papers
seek a solution secretly i know some
one who may be able to help us the
police cant and we mustnt even let them
suspect what we think what we fear
weve got to hush it up for the mu-
seums sake

   the detective was staring at them pity-
ingly you gentlemen better get out of
here he said you aint used to sights
like this i used to say queer things my-
self when i was new at this game i
went balmy over corpses i couldnt
stand the sight of em used to get down
on my knees and pray-when no one was
watching never let on of course but
were all like that at first

  with an effort algernon mastered his
agitation youre right sergeant he
said mr scollard and i acknowledge
that this business is a little too disturbing
for sane contemplation so well retire
as you suggest but i must insist again
that you refrain from putting poor hsieh
ho on the grill

  in the corridor he drew mr scollard
aside and conversed for a moment ur-
gently in a low voice then he ap-
proached the detective and handed him a
card if you want me within the next
few hours youll find me at this address
he said mr scollard is returning to
his home in brooklyn youll find his
phone number in the directory but i
hope you wont disturb him unless some-
thing really grave turns up

  the detective nodded and read aloud
the address on algernons card dr

tinently

as a monkey and could shinny up a drain-

the necromantic tale

 by clark ashton smith

sir roderick hagdons life was tied to the personality of an infamous long-t

dead ancestor

in one sense it is a mere truism to
speak of the evocative power of
words the olden efficacy of subtly
woven spells of magic formulas and in-
cantations has long become a literary
metaphor though the terrible reality
which once underlay and may still under-
lie such concepts has been forgotten
however the necromancy of language is
more than a metaphor to sir roderick
hagdon the scars of fire on his ankles
are things which no one could possibly
regard as having their origin in a figure
of speech

sir roderick hagdon came to his title
and his estate with no definite expecta-

tion of inheriting them nor any first-
hand knowledge of the sort of life and
surroundings entailed by his inheritance
he had been bom in australia and
though he had known that his father was
the younger brother of sir john hagdon
he had formed only the vaguest idea of
the ancestral manor and the interest that
he felt therein was even vaguer his sur-
prize was little short of consternation
when the deaths of his father of sir
john hagdon and sir johns only son
all occurring within less than a year left
clear his own succession and brought a
letter from the family lawyers informing
him of this fact-which otherwise might
the necromantic tale



have escaped his attention his mother
too was dead and he was unmarried so
leaving the australian sheep-range in
charge of a competent overseer he had
sailed immediately for england to assume
his hereditary privileges

  it was a strange experience for him
and strangest of all in view of the fact
that he had never before visited england
was the inexplicable feeling of familiarity
aroused by his first sight of the hagdon
manor he seemed to know the farm-
lands the cottages of the tenants the
wood of ancient oaks with their burdens
of druidic mistletoe and the old manor-
house half hidden among gigantic yews
as if he had seen them all in some period
that was past recollection being of an
analytic trend he attributed all this to
that imperfect simultaneousness in the
action of the brain-hemispheres by which
psychologists account for such phenom-
ena but the feeling remained and grew
upon him and he yielded more and more
to its half-sinister charm as he explored
his property and delved in the family
archives he felt also an unexpected kin-
ship with his ancestors-a feeling which
had lain wholly dormant during his aus-
tralian youth their portraits peering
upon him from the never-dissipated
shadows of the long hall wherein they
hung were like well-known faces

   the manor-house it was said had been
built in the reign of henry the seventh
it was mossed and lidiened with an-
tiquity and there was a hint of begin-
ning dilapidation in the time-worn stone
of the walls the formal garden had
gone a little wild from neglect the
trimmed hedges and trees had taken on
fantastic sprawling shapes and evil
poisonous weeds had invaded the flower-
beds there were statues of cracked
marble and verdigris-eaten bronze amid
the shrubbery there were fountains that
had long ceased to flow and dials on

which the foliage-intercepted sun no
longer fell about it all there hung an
air of shadow-laden time and subtle
decadence but though he had never
known anything but the primitive aus-
tralian environment hagdon found him-
self quite at home in this atmosphere of
old world complexities-an atmosphere
that was made from the dissolving phan-
toms of a thousand years from the breath-
ings of dead men and women from loves
and hates that had gone down to dust
contrary to his anticipations he felt no
nostalgia whatever for the remote land of
his birth and upbringing

  sir roderick came to love the sunless
gardens and the overtowering yews but
above and beyond these he was fas-
cinated by the manor-house itself by the
hall of ancestral portraits and the dark
dusty library in which he found an
amazing medley of rare tomes and manu-
scripts there were many first editions of
elizabethan poets and dramatists and
mingled with these in a quaint disorder
were antique books on astrology and con-
juration on demonism and magic sir
roderick shivered a little he knew not
why as he turned the leaves of some of
these latter volumes from whose ancient
vellum and parchment arose to his nos-
trils an odor that was like the mustiness
of tombs he closed them hastily and
the first editions were unable to detain
him but he lingered long over certain
genealogies and manuscript records of
the hagdon family filled with a strange
eagerness to learn as much as he could
concerning these shadowy forebears of
his

  in going through the records he was
struck by the brevity of the mention ac-
corded to a former sir roderick hagdon
who had lived in the early seventeenth
century all other members of die direct
line had been dealt with at some length
their deeds their marriages and their


weird tales

various claims to distinction often in the
role of soldiers or scholars were usually
set forth with a well-nigh vainglorious
unction but concerning sir roderick
nothing more was given than the bare
dates of his birth and death and the fact
that he was the father of one sir ralph
hagdon no mention whatever was made
of his wife

  though there was no obvious reason
for more than a passing surmise the
present sir roderick wondered and specu-
lated much over these singular and per-
haps sinister omissions his curiosity in-
creased when he found that there was no
portrait of sir roderick in the gallery
and none of his mysterious unnamed
lady there was not even a vacant place
between the pictures of sir rodericks
father and son to indicate that there ever
had been a portrait the new baronet
determined to solve the mystery if pos-
sible an element of vague but imperative
disquietude was now mingled with his
curiosity he could not have analyzed his
feelings but the life and fate of this un-
known ancestor seemed to take on for
him a special significance a concern that
was incomprehensibly personal and in-
timate

  at times he felt that his obsession
with this problem was utterly ridiculous
and uncalled-for nevertheless he ran-
sacked the manor-house in the hope of
finding some hidden record and he ques-
tioned the servants the tenants and the
people of the parish to learn if there were
any legendry concerning his namesake
the manor-house yielded nothing more to
his search and his inquiries met with
blank faces and avowals of ignorance no
one seemed to have heard of this elusive
seventeenth century baronet

   at last from the family butler james
wharton an octogenarian who had
served three generations of hagdons sir
roderick obtained the clue which he

sought wharton who was now on the
brink of senility and had grown forget-
ful and taciturn was seemingly ignorant
as the rest but one day after repeated
questioning he remembered that he had
been told in his youth of a secret closet
behind one of the book-shelves in which
certain manuscripts and heirlooms had
been locked away several hundred years
before and which for some unknown
reason no hagdon had ever opened since
that time here he suggested something
might be found that would serve to illu-
mine the dark gap in the family history
there was a cunning sardonic gleam in
his rheumy eyes as he came forth with
this tardy piece of information and sir
roderick wondered if the old man were
not possessed of more genealogical lore
than he was willing to admit all at once
he conceived the disquieting idea that
perhaps he was on the verge of some
abominable discovery on the threshold
of things that had been forgotten because
they were too dreadful for remembrance

  however he did not hesitate he was
conscious of a veritable compulsion to
learn whatever could be learned the
bookcase indicated by the half-senile but-
ler was the one which contained most of
the volumes on demonism and magic it
was now removed and sir roderick went
over the uncovered wall inch by inch
after much futile fumbling he located
and pressed a hidden spring and the
door of the sealed room swung open

  it was little more than a cupboard
though a man could have concealed him-
self within it in time of need doubtless
it had been built primarily for some such
purpose from out its narrow gloom the
moldiness of dead ages rushed upon sir
roderick together with the ghosts of
queer exotic perfumes such as might have
poured from the burning of unholy cen-
sers in satanic rites it was an effluence
of mystery and of evil within there
the necromantic tale



were several ponderous brazen-bound
volumes of mediaeval date a thin manu-
script of yellowing parchment and two
portraits whose faces had been turned to
the wall as if it were unlawful for even
the darkness of the sealed closet to behold
them

sir roderick brought the volumes the
manuscript and the portrait forth to
the light the pictures which he exam-
ined first represented a man and woman
who were both in the bloom of life both
were attired in seventeenth century cos-
tumes and the new sir roderick did not
doubt for a moment that they were the
mysterious couple concerning whom the
family records were so reticent

   he thrilled with a strange excitement
with a feeling of some momentous revela-
tion that he could not wholly compre-
hend as he looked upon them even at a
glance he saw the singular resemblance
of the first sir roderick to himself-a
likeness otherwise unduplicated in the
family which tended to an almost anti-
nomian type there were the same fal-
con-like features the same pallor of
brow and cheek the same semi-morbid
luster of eyes the same bloodless lips
that seemed to be carven from a marble
that had also been chiselled for the long
hollow eyelids the majority of the hag-
dons were broad and sanguine and ruddy
but in these two a darker strain had re-
peated itself across the centuries the
main difference was in the expression for
the look of the first sir roderick was that
of a man who has given himself with a
passionate devotion to all things evil and
corrupt who has gone down to damna-
tion through some inevitable fatality of
his own being

   sir roderick gazed on the picture with
a fascination that was partly horror and
partly the stirring of emotions which he
could not have named then he turned

to the woman and a wild agitation over-
mastered him before the sullen-smiling
mouth and the malign oval of the lovely
cheeks she too was evil and her beauty
was that of lilith she was like some
crimson-lipped and honey-scented flower
that grows on the brink of hell but sir
roderick knew with the terror and fear-
ful rapture of one who longs to fling him-
self from a precipice that here was the
one woman he might have loved if haply
he had known her then in a moment
of reeling and whirling confusion it
seemed to him that he had known and
loved her though he could not remember
when nor where

  the feeling of eery confusion passed
and sir roderick began to examine the
brass-bound volumes they were written
in a barbarous decadent latin and dealt
mainly with methods and formulas for
the evocation of such demons as ache-
ront amaimon asmodi and ashtoreth
together with innumerable others sir
roderick shuddered at the curious draw-
ings with which they were illuminated
but they did not detain him long with
a thrill of actual trepidation like one who
is about to enter some awful and unhal-
lowed place he took up the manuscript of
yellowing parchment

  it was late afternoon when he began
to read and rays of dusty amber were
slanting through the low panes of the
library windows as he read on he gave
no heed to the sinking of the light and
the last words were plain as runes of fire
when he finished his perusal in the dusk
he closed his eyes and could still see
them

   and sir roderick hagdonne was now deemed
a moste infamous warlocke and hys ladye elinore
a nefandous witche    and both were burned
at the stake on hagdonne common for their crimes
against god and man and their sorcerous deedes
and practices were thought so foule a blotte on ye
knighthoode of england that no man speaks there-
of and no grandam tells the tale to the children
at her knee so by god hys mercy the memorie
of thys foulnesse shall haply be forgotten for


weird tales

surely itte were an ill thing that such should be
recalled

  then at the very bottom of the page
there was a brief mysterious footnote in a
finer hand than the rest

  there be those amid the thronge who deemed
that they saw sir rodericke vanish when the flames
leaped high and thys if true is the moste dam-
nable proof of hys compact and hys commerce with
the evill one

  sir roderick sat for a long while in
the thickening twilight he was un-
strung he was abnormally shaken and dis-
traught by the biographical record he had
just read-a record that had been written
by some unknown hand in a bygone cen-
tury it was not pleasant for any man to
find a tale so dreadful amid the archives
of his family history but the fact that
the narrative concerned the first sir
roderick and his lady elinor was hardly
enough to account for all the spiritual
turmoil and horror into which he was
plunged somehow in a way that was
past analysis that was more intimate than
his regard for the remote blot on the
hagdon name he felt that the thing con-
cerned himself also a terrible nervous
perturbation possessed him his very
sense of identity was troubled he was
adrift in a sea of abominable confusion
of disoriented thoughts and capsizing
memories in this peculiar state of mind
by an automatic impulse he lit the floor-
lamp beside his chair and began to re-
read the manuscript

almost in the casual manner of a mod-
t ern tale the story opened with an
account of sir rodericks first meeting at
the age of twenty-three with elinor
davenant who was afterward to become
his wife

  this time as he read a peculiar hal-
lucination seized the new baronet it
seemed to him that the words of the old
writing had begun to waver and change
beneath his scrutiny diat under the black

lines of script on yellowing parchment
the picture of an actual place was form-
ing the page expanded the letters grew
dim and gigantic they seemed to fade
out in midair and the picture behind
them was no longer a picture but the
very scene of the narrative as if the
wording were a necromantic spell the
room about him had vanished like the
chamber of a dream and he stood in the
open sunlight of a windy moor bees
were humming around him and the scent
of heather was in his nostrils his con-
sciousness was indescribably dual some-
where he knew one part of his brain
was still reading the ancient record but
the rest of his personality had become
identified with that of the first sir rod-
erick hagdon inevitably with no sur-
prize or astonishment he found himself
living in a bygone age with the percep-
tions and memories of an ancestor who
was long dead

  now sir roderick hagdonne being in the
flower of hys youth became instantlie enamoured
of the beauteous elinore davenant whenas he
mette her of an aprile morn on hagdonne
heathe

  sir roderick saw that he was not alone
on the moor a woman was coming
toward him along the narrow path amid
the heather though clad in the conven-
tional gown and bodice of the period she
was somehow foreign and exotic to that
familiar english landscape she was the
woman of the portrait which in a later
life as another sir roderick he had
found in a sealed room of the manor-
house but this like much else he had
now forgotten walking with a languid
grace amid the homely blossoms of the
heath her beauty was like that of some
opulent and sinister lily from saracenic
lands he thought that he had never
seen any one half so strange and lovely

  he stood to one side in the stiff growth
and bowed before her with a knightly
courtesy as she passed she nodded slight-
the necromantic tale



ly in acknowledgment and gave him an
unfathomable smile and an oblique flash
of her dark eyes from that time sir
roderick was her slave and her devotee
he stared after her as she disappeared on
the curving slope and felt the mounting
of an irresistible flame in his heart and
the stirring of hot desires and curiosities
he seemed to inhale the spice of a lan-
guorous alien perfume with every breath
of the homeland air as he walked on-
ward musing with ingenuous rapture on
the dark enigmatic beauty of the face he
had seen

  now in that queer necromantic dream
sir roderick seemed to live or re-live
the events of an entire lustrum some-
where in another existence another self
was conning briefly the paragraphs which
detailed these events but of this he was
conscious only at long intervals and then
vaguely so complete was his immersion
in the progress of the tale as if he had
drunk of that lethe which alone makes
it possible to live again that he was un-
troubled by any prevision of a future
known to the sir roderick who sat re-
reading an old manuscript even as it
was written he returned from the moor
to hagdon hall with the vision of a fan-
stranger in his heart he made inquiries
concerning her and learned that she was
the daughter of sir john davenant
who had but recently received his knight-
hood for diplomatic services and had
now taken up his abode on the estate
near hagdon that went with his title
sir roderick was now doubly impelled
to call on his new neighbors and his
first visit was soon repeated he became
an open suitor for the hand of elinor
davenant and after a wooing of sev-
eral months he married her

  the passionate love with which she had
inspired him was only deepened by their
life together always her allurement was
that of things but half understood of

momentous revelations eternally half
withheld she seemed to love him truly
in return but ever her heart and soul
were strange to him ever they were mys-
terious and exotic even as die first sight
of her face had been for this mayhap
he loved her all the more they were
happy together and she bore him one
child a son whom they named ralph

  now in that other life the sir rod-
erick who was reading in the old library
came to these words

   no man knew how it happed but anon there
were dreade whispers and foule rumours regarding
the ladye elinore and people said that she was a
witch and in their time these rumours readied
the eare of sir roderick

  a horror crept upon the happy dream
-a horror scarce to be comprehended in
this modern age there were formless
evil wings that came to brood above
hagdon hall and the very air was
poisoned with malignant murmurs day
by day and night by night the baronet
was tortured with a vile unholy sus-
picion of the woman he loved he
watched her with a fearful anxiety with
eyes that dreaded to discern a new and
more ominous meaning in her strange
beauty then when he could bear it no
longer he taxed her with the infamous
things he had heard hoping she would
deny them and by virtue of he denial
restore fully his former trust and peace
of mind

  to his utter consternation die lady
elinor laughed in his face with a soft
siren-like mirth and made open avowal
that the charges were true

  and i trow she added that you
love me too well to disown or betray me
that for my sake if need be you will
become a veritable wizard even as i am
a witch and will share with me the in-
fernal sports of the sabbat

  sir roderick pleaded he cajoled he
-commanded he threatened but ever she
answered him with voluptuous laughter


weird tales

and circean smiles and ever she told
him of those delights and privileges
which are procurable only through
damnation through the perilous aid of
demons and succubi till through his
exceeding love for her even as she had
foretold sir roderick suffered himself
to become an initiate in the arts of sor-
cery and sealed his own pact with the
powers of evil that he might in all
things be made forever one with her that
he loved so dearly

  it was an age of dark beliefs and of
practises that were no less dark and
witchcraft and sorcery were rampant
throughout the land among all classes
but in the lilith-like elinor there was a
spirit of soulless depravity beyond that of
all others and beneath the seduction of
her love the hapless sir roderick fell to
depths wherefrom no man could return
and made mortgage of his soul and
brain and body to satan he learned the
varying malefic usages to which a waxen
image could be put he memorized the
formulas that summon frightful things
from their abode in the nethermost night
or compel the dead to do the abominable
will of necromancers and he was
taught the secrets whereof it is unlaw-
ful to tell or even hint and came to
know the maledictions and invultuations
which are lethal to more than the mortal
flesh and hagdon hall became the
scene of pandemonian revels of rites that
were both obscene and blasphemous and
the terror and turpitude of hellish things
were effluent therefrom on all the coun-
tryside and amid her coterie of the
damned amid the witches and sorcerers
and incubi that fawned upon her the
lady elinor exulted openly and sir
roderick was her partner in each new
enormity or baleful deed and in this
atmosphere of noisome things of satanic
crime and sacrilege the child ralph was
alone innocent being too young to be

harmed thereby as yet but anon the
scandal of it all was a horror in mens
souls that could be endured no longer
and the justice of the law which made a
felony of witchcraft was called upon by
the people of hagdon

  it was no new thing for members of
the nobility to be tried on such a charge
before the secular or ecclesiastical courts
such cases in which the accusations were
often doubtful or prompted by mere
malice had sometimes been fought at
length but this time the guilt of the de-
fendants was so universally maintained
and the reprobation aroused thereby so
profound that only the briefest and most
perfunctory trial was accorded them
they were condemned to be burnt at the
stake the sentence to be carried out on
the following day

it was a chill dank morning in autumn
when sir roderick and lady elinor
were borne to the place of execution and
were tied to their respective stakes with
piles of dry fagots at their feet they
were set facing each other so that neither
might lose any detail of their mutual
agony a crowd was gathered about
them thronging the entire common-a
crowd whose awful silence was unbroken
by any outcry or murmur so deep was
the terror wrought by this infamous
couple that no one dared to execrate or
mock them even in the hour of their
downfall sir rodericks brain was be-
numbed by the obloquy and shame and
horror of his situation by a realization
of the ultimate depths to which he had
fallen of the bitter doom that was now
imminent he looked at his wife and
thought of how she had drawn him down
from evil to evil through his surpassing
love for her and then he thought of the
frightful searing pangs that would con-
vulse her soft body and thinking of these
he forgot his own fate
the necromantic tale



  then in a dim exiguous manner he
remembered that somewhere in another
century there sat another sir roderick
who was reading all this in an old manu-
script if he could only break the necro-
mantic spell of the tale and re-identify
himself with that other sir roderick he
would be saved from the fiery doom that
awaited him but if he could not deny the
spell he would surely perish even as a
falling man who reaches bottom in a
dream is said to perish

  he looked again and met the gaze of
the lady elinor she smiled across her
bonds and fagots with all the old seduc-
tion that had been so fatal to him in
the re-attained duality of his conscious-
ness it seemed as if she were aware of
his intention and had willed to deter
him the ache and anguish of a deadly
lure was upon him as he closed his eyes
and tried very hard to picture the old
library and the sheet of parchment which
his other self was now perusing if he
could do this the whole diabolical illu-
sion would vanish the process of vis-
ualization and sympathetic identification
which had been carried to an hallucina-
tive degree would return to that which
is normally experienced by the reader of
an absorbing tale

  there was a crackling at his feet for
some one had lit the fagots sir rode-
rick opened his eyes a little and saw that
the pile at lady elinors feet had likewise
been lit threads of smoke were rising
from each pile with tiny tongues of flame
that grew longer momently he did not
lift his eyes to the level of lady elinors
face resolutely he closed them again
and sought to re-summon the written
page

  he was aware of a growing warmth
underneath his soles and now with an
agonizing flash of pain he felt the lick-
ing of the flames about his ankles but
somehow by a desperate effort of his
will like one who awakens voluntarily
from a clutching nightmare he saw
before him the written words he was try-
ing to vizualize

  and both were burned at the stake on hag-
donne common for their crimes against god and
man

  the words wavered they receded and
drew near on a page that was still dim
and enormous but the crackling at his
feet had ceased the air was no longer
dank and chill no longer charged with
acrid smoke there was a moment of
madly whirling vertigo and confusion
and then sir rodericks two selves were
re-united and he found that he was sit-
ting in the library chair at hagdon star-
ing with open eyes at the last sentences
of the manuscript in his hands

  he felt as if he had been through some
infernal ordeal that had lasted many
years and he was still half obsessed by
emotions of sorrow and regret and hor-
ror that could belong only to a dead
progenitor but the whole thing was
manifestly a dream albeit terrible and
real to a degree that he had never before
experienced he must have fallen asleep
over the old record    but why then
if it were only a dream did his ankles
still pain him so frightfully as if they
had been seared by fire

  he bent down and examined them
beneath the twentieth century hose in
which they were attired he found the
upward-flaring marks of recent burns

gardiner

   the man in the club was

it was good of you a stranger to
accept my invitation sir and share
with me the comparative solitude of
this inglenook in all this crowded yet
exclusive club there is no one that i know
-you see i am a guest here only and my
friend who brought me was called away
suddenly by an urgent telegram that
brooked of no delay

  until you came and took pity on me i
seemed doomed to spend the evening in
lonely solitude though surrounded by
hundreds of my fellow men and that
would be the worst possible thing that
might befall me for tomorrow is my wed-
ding day

  oh i should be the happiest man
alive instead of the most miserable when
a man has won the hand of such a price-


less treasure as is my fiancee fortunes
cup should be brimming over and yet-
and yet-my heart is filled with gloomy
forebodings would to god that i could
shut out forever from my memory those
scenes that recur monotonously over and
over turning present joys to dust and
ashes in my mouth

  you start you look about this club-
room in bewilderment no i assure you
i am not drunk though i have reason
enough for such a state you seemed so
friendly so balanced of such an under-
standing nature that i was immediately
drawn to you you seemed so like my
father who died long years ago you
seemed so like that other that i knew in
the days that-

  my name on that bit of cardboard in

     j see once more that monster
     with bis single baleful eye burling
     the great rocks through the air

strangely gifted-or cursed-by a vivid memory of
the voyage of odysseus
the galley slave



your hand can mean nothing to you yes
i must admit that i am the william ar-
nold mentioned so frequently in the social
news of the metropolis and who for the
past week has appeared so often in the
newspapers of this city as well where i
am almost a total stranger while your
card-indeed i know you as an antiqua-
rian as the foremost authority on the lore
of ancient almost forgotten civilizations
and to you-it seems that the hand of
destiny drew me to you-to you what i
am going to tell should prove of absorb-
ing interest for you are the most eminent-
ly fitted to interpret it aright

   but i perceive that i have said either
too much or too little your pardon but
i must talk to some understanding soul-
must pour out my story lest i go mad
you are sure that you dont mind you
would be delighted to help if that were
possible i knew that i was not mistaken
i knew that my intuitions had not played
me false though as for helping me-i
wonder if in all this world there is any
help for me but if you will bear with
me sir-

   i trust this vintage is to your liking it
is very favorably known and i can as-
sure you- then that is quite all

right

  and now let me ask a question of
you not to be inquisitive but merely to
clear the atmosphere do you hold with
most moderns that there is a hereafter

another life beyond the grave it is a
common a universal belief widely scat-
tered as to both time and place per-
haps like most moderns you have put
that hereafter in heaven that too is al-
most a commonplace you have now
having gone so far let me ask you yet
another question we will take for the
moment one of those who lived in the
ages long since passed one who also be-
lieved in a hereafter in another life after
death there is no difference say you
whether he lived now or in dim distant
ages perhaps not we still agree but
i ask you to go back to that one long
since dead might not his hereafter be
now absurd impossible and i ask
you who are still sputtering-i ask you
one little word why

  aha i have you there you frown
you rant i ask you to give me one logi-
cal reason against it-just one you
can not do it you only shout non-
sense is it then give me facts to
prove your stand no give me at
least plausible reasons-what you can
not no you can only give me noise-
and noise my dear sir comes from any
drum when it is beaten just because that
drum is empty

  transmigration of souls why yes i
believe it is so called it is a doctrine
believed in by teeming millions in this
day and age though it is not so much the
fashion among such as you and me but
i assure you my dear sir it is quite as
logical and even more plausible than the
tenets which you hold there is no need
to sit there and glare at me nor any need
to pound upon the table and ask me for
proofs that my dear fellow is the
very thing i shall now try to give you
oh ho that shaft touched home did
it proof you shall have-proof you
can not doubt thrice lucky for me that
you are an authority on ancient cultures
but enough of this


weird tales

  it grows late my dear sir and there is
much to tell attend me carefully the
pad i placed at your elbow is for such
notes as you might care to make during
my tale and i give you leave to ask such
questions as you will i ask but one
thing of you-a little thing after all
inasmuch as its publication might prove
embarrassing now will you hold such
notes as you may make until i give you

leave to publish or until- ah yes

you understand a post-mortem state-
ment yes that is the term i believe that
you moderns use though you borrowed
it from us who have been gone these long
ages i beg you to forget that last re-
mark it is of no importance a mere di-
gression as it were

let us take up the subject of transmi-
gration in the abstract-as a theory
only i hasten to add all these myriads
who died believing in another life here-
after- very well i accept the cor-
rection we will say then another life
in heaven they died through the ages
-well and good they shall reappear
in heaven that can not offend you
but you cramp me i must begin in a
different way

  let us take a newborn life upon this
earth you can not tell me nor can any
other man from whence that life comes
you can not definitely assure me that this
newborn life is appearing for the first
time on this earth aha you squirm

  by its very ignorance and its having to
learn every least thing pertaining to this
life it proves in itself conclusively that
it can have had no previous existence
here that is very well put nor shall
i bring up against you what we may call
instinctive knowledge

  i will not ask you that troublesome
question what is gone from a dead body
that was within it when it was still alive
i shall be equally silent about where that

missing thing has gone when we view the
dead body for your answer must take
into consideration that nothing is ever
lost from this globe it is merely trans-
formed into something else after all
i am not trying to convert you to my
theory of transmigration

  we come into this world and we leave
it again and it is all a great mystery
the psalmist has said i am fearfully
and wonderfully made we still think
so but you are impatient

  give me one clear-cut case to prove
the point or forever hold your peace
you say

  very well i shall try to do just that
and on your own head be the conse-
quences that example shall be-my-
self smoke up my friend fill that
pad with notes to your hearts content

  the theory held in highest repute by
us believers in transmigration is that after-
each return journey to this earth there is
a door closed in our memory that shuts
up forever all knowledge of that former
existence on this terrestrial globe could
we find but one single mind where those
doors or even but one of them were
open to no matter what slight degree
dien we would have something on which
to go ahead and at that very point we
have met constant failure by the way
that is the very point you wished to use
to refute me is it not

  you must bear with me for the liberal
sprinkling of first person pronouns that
i am compelled to use from this point on
for after all i am dissecting myself be-
fore your keen scientific eyes i am go-
ing back now to the period of my adoles-
cence when i first noticed the difference
between me and my fellows it was
perhaps when i was eleven or twelve
years old night after night i awoke in
a cold sweat of terror the bedclothes
clutched in a death-grip as i dreamed
that i was falling-falling-and often

                    w t-
the galley slave



the shriek from my fear-constricted throat
that awakened me awoke my more pro-
saic elder brother who slept in the same
room

  you say that the falling dream is very
common to us humans and especially to
the young you say that it is the im-
pression made on the race by the count-
less thousands of our arboreal ancestors
who swung through the treetops in great
bounding swoops that it comes from
those who crashed through the maze of
slender branches and caught their hold
again those who failed to save them-
selves crashed to their death and left no
memories-nor posterity either for that
matter very good we must perforce
drop that line

  let us go on now to three years ago
when i first saw the mountains-saw
them and loved them at once so much so
that i resolved never to leave them yes
i had dwelt before always in the plains
that too is a common thing you say
that love of the high places by those who
have dwelt always in the lowlands i do
not know but attend me closely

  i came at last to a place that was
vaguely familiar no more though i
had never been there before to my knowl-
edge yet as the train swung around each
bend i knew just what we should find
spread before our eyes every grim
lichened boulder and aspiring forest
giant every tumbling brook nor was i
ever deceived-not once

  explain that to me if you can telep-
athy bah yet i am very sensitive
that way i get a great deal from others
that does not come in words-even as i
get your hostile attitude very well
we shall drop that line also though i
could give you a multitude of strange
facts about that country in which i have
dwelt almost constantly since

  now let us go back to yet another
thing i shall take you back to my four-
w t-

teenth year when at school we took up
the lltad and the odyssey it was my
first contact with that period and its an-
cient culture and it stirred me tremen-
dously yes it has stirred the whole
world quite as much as it swayed me i
agree with you there i made perfect
grades in those subjects under a teacher
who was notorious for her low marks

   for the first time in my life i wanted
to draw i drew sketches of all that
glorious adventure my books were filled
with them and other sheets of paper as
well rude enough they were for the
most part yet some of them were con-
sidered worthy of a place in the schools
annual exhibit and after that was over
they went out as a part of a national
school childrens exhibit and i had no lit-
tle trouble to get them returned to me
but get them back i did if you will
come with me to my room i will show
them to you thank you

  let us take them up in order i agree
with you some of them are hopelessly
crude but let us take up some significant
points about them as a whole remem-
ber i had read only the unadorned eng-
lish text that we studied and i had abso-
lutely no background reading of that
period bearing that in mind does not
something about them strike you as im-
portant no

   they are very ordinary sketches of that
period quite so that was the gen-
eral comment when they were viewed
but authorities on that period noted one
very significant fact-just one and they
all noted it as far as they could tell
from all their exhaustive esearches of
that age these sketches were absolutely
true in every minute detail

  whence came that fidelity to the life
of those old dim ages i had nothing
but the poor inadequate english text to
guide me yet manners customs dress-
look at those shields the spears the


weird tales

ships the architecture-see the fidelity to
those things as they really were the
texts that guided me were not so exact
and definite but that they would allow
many mistakes in all this mass of detail

  let me tell you why my friend you
who are now so frankly puzzled and baf-
fled i was drawing a life that i knew
quite as intimately and thoroughly as if
i had lived it utter rot isnt it i
would scrawl and scribble most of the
period while that gorgon of a teacher
glowered at me she shot questions at
me sly tricky questions out of her col-
lege-trained mind that had absorbed more
about that period and about those two
books than most common mortals for
they were a passion with her and al-
ways my answer was ready and always it
was right

one day-we were deep in the odys-
sey then-she shot a question at me
and i never looked up as i answered her
i knew my answer was right she gave
a gasp jumped to her feet and-
screamed

  odd yes indeed for her question
was couched in classic greek and my
answer was in the common vulgar greek
of the lower classes-an ancient greek
tongue of which she could understand
just enough to get the astounding fact
with full force i i went on draw-
ing i never knew that both question and
answer had not been given in english

  the poor woman was so upset that she
dismissed the class then and there only
as we swarmed out into the hallway and
the boys crowded around me demanding
to know what we two had said did i
realize that neither of us had spoken
english but it was not until after school
when she and i had a long earnest talk
together that i began to understand

  we two talked then so deep in that
deathless old story that the building

might have burned about our heads and
we should never have noticed it or rath-
er she did most of the talking while i
scrawled aimlessly on the blackboard
what i scrawled on that black surface
that afternoon was to come back to me
most vividly two years later but we will
leave that for the present and come back
to it again

  do you remember that part of the story
that depicts the loss of one of the ships
ah you do  yes thats the very pas-
sage when we came to that we got an-
other recess but it was my fault this time
instead of the teachers she had caught
me scribbling again and she made me de-
scribe the sinking of that ship in my own
words

  i must have done so with a will for as
i told the class of those waves crashing
over the side and leaping down upon the
rowers chained to their benches i fainted
dead away and i only came to my senses
again when i lay on the floor out in the
hall gasping dripping with the water
they had poured over me four of the
boys still had me gripped by as many dif-
ferent parts of my anatomy and it had
taken all of them to bring me from the
recitation room

  what was that how did the waves
look as they broke upon that sinking
ship how odd of you to ask that i
have had to answer that very question
many times in the past few years but it
is very easy to answer the scene has been
indelibly etched upon my memory there
was a sudden lurch the stout planking
dropped swiftly beneath us while for a
single instant the waves stood still in a
thin green and white line above us then
they leaped down-oh zeus 

  thank you sir  i feel better now
im very sorry it was most inconsider-
ate of me to faint like that whats that
sir you say you were aboard the mat-
sonia when she went down off the new-
the galley slave



foundland banks with a heavy loss of
life you saw the waves looking pre-
dsely like that for just a split second
you will never forget it neither will i
it is unforgettable isnt it

  i beg your pardon sir you asked me
what i had scrawled upon the blackboard
that day and you want to know how it
fits into this puzzle the teacher had
made no mention of it at the time but
she had copied it very carefully on paper
and she sent it to her old university pro-
fessor who was an authority on andent
greece and its languages both written
and spoken his name why yes
talbert perhaps you know him you
do you say he is indeed the foremost
authority upon things of that time and
that he has done a deal of research work
on the very site of that deathless story
i had heard so myself

our family moved away from that city
the same week that i so thoroughly
demoralized the class and naturally i
never finished class work upon the odys-
sey but the teacher kept in dose touch
with me through her letters long letters
that contained a minimum of school gos-
sip and a maximum of questions about
that tremendous voyage of odysseus
questions that i answered most religiously
and often voluminously i did not know
that for a period of two years or more
an exact copy of my letters went to pro-
fessor talbert at that eastern university
or that the entire mass of correspondence
was later published as a monograph nor
did i know that it rocked the classic
world and its students to their founda-
tions there was a map for example
that i had drawn quite accurate enough
in its way that showed the location of
some of the long-lost dties dries that
were little more than names they have
since been excavated in part and found
to lie just where i had located them

  what did i write upon that black-
board how impatient you are i had
scrawled several lines of greek thereon
that vulgar ancient form of whidi i have
spoken professor talberts translation
showed that it was a fairly vivid word-
picture of that famous scene of which i
spoke before and espedally graphic was
the description of that monster who
tossed the rocks that sank us

  but let us get back to our premise
the return of a soul from that dim his-
toric past to this earth at the present time
i have shown you a sixteen-year-old lad
bom in the middle west who could not
have had any previous knowledge of a
time so far back in the dawn of history
he could not have read of the things he
told for most of them were new even to
those who had spent long years traang
down such fragmentary facts as the world
then possessed of that dim distant age
the things he told as published in that
epochal monograph upset many of their
preconceived notions though later re-
searches proved him surprizingly correct
and the antiquarians themselves at fault

  how came that knowledge to him
how unless one of those doors had in-
deed been left unlocked unless he was
really one of that heroic band come back
to life in our commonplace workaday
world fantastic and absurd impossi-
ble yet can you give a more likely ex-
planation

  you say that there is only my unsup-
ported word then i have failed failed
where i had hoped so greatly but per-
haps you still have some questions to put
to me what of my knowledge of the
rest of that voyage i have none i
must have died when that ship went
down under the barrage of great stones
what impressions are most vivid nat-
urally that last one stands out above all
the rest and next to that-i have awak-
ened times without number wearied to


weird tales

exhaustion over the eternal rowing-end-
less ceaseless rowing with the intolerable
pain of the chafing leg-irons-

  yes indeed those oars were manned
by slaves shackled to their benches no-
where in the text of that great trip is such
a thing mentioned yet it seems now quite
well authenticated as a fact what of
my fears-why should this thing make
any difference in my life-you call them
hallucinations perhaps that is what they
are after all though to me they seem real
enough

  i can not explain that fear though it
is ever present let me elucidate there
was the time when a lad in school i de-
scribed the scene-and fainted the
boys told me what a struggle they had
with me at the time how they fought to
bring me back to life you too had
some little experience a short time ago
it has been like that every time the thing
has come into my mind and that has been
rather too often always there has been
such a struggle and i am afraid that it
will happen just once too often and i
shall go-go out into that unknown void
to reappear perhaps under more auspi-
cious circumstances at another date but
i perceive that once more i have offended
you true you said nothing neither did
your appearance change in the slightest
but i caught your thoughts as plainly as
though you spoke them openly

  i fear for myself every time the mists
clear away and i see once more that mon-
ster with his single baleful eye hurling
the great rocks through the air the
first falls short and drops into the sea
with a mighty splash the next goes far
beyond us a third goes through our
great sail riving it from top to bottom
while we struggle madly with the great
ash oars they are out at last

  while the captain of the rowers runs
up and down his runway between the
banks of seats lashing furiously at our

naked unprotected backs we find the
rhythm faster and faster the water
boils backward from our churning blades
the vessel leaps forward and the spears-
men upon the high stem can no more
hurl their puny weapons at his vast bulk
we draw farther and farther away we
shall yet escape but no he tears
loose a great gray rock from the waters
very edge his mighty thews and sinews
crack as he heaves it far beyond the rest
of his casts it crashes through our
decks leaving a sickening welter of
jagged splinters and pulpy arms and legs
and crushed bodies that spout great gouts
of blood into the inrushing flood the
ship quivers with her death blow the
deck sinks beneath our frenzied feet to
the echo of our mad yells for freedom
from our chains for a single moment
the sea stands rimmed about us then the
waves dash madly down between our

ranks- oh poseidon hold thy

hand zeus father zeus spare--



the above is the exact transcript of
the stenographic notes i made dur-
ing my chat and brief visit with william
arnold at the time of his sudden demise
the young man an utter stranger had
asked me to dine with him had told me
the strange story here set down that had
such a fatal termination he was un-
questionably insane while his sudden
end caused much speculation it was un-
doubtedly due to heart failure so called

  i noticed but one peculiar feature-a
point entirely overlooked by the medical
practitioner whom the club governors
called in and who certified to his death
from natural causes the young mans
lungs were filled with water as are those
of a drowned person

  where it came from i do not know
the quantity seemed too great to have
the portal to power



been the glassful that i dashed into his
face in my first efforts to revive him be-
fore the doaor arrived

  as to the theory he sought to prove it
can have no basis in faa well informed
as he unquestionably was on the ancient
culture of pre-homeric greece this has
all been threshed out in the journals de-
voted to those subjects and especially in
the monumental work of professor m t

talbert briefly alluded to in the above
account

  the mass of drawings that he entrusted
to me is being carefully studied as well
as the greek inscriptions upon them i
consider them copies of ancient scrawls
dating possibly from pre-mycenean times
though i am at a loss to explain where
the young man could have found the
originals

  chapter 

ay i come in asked the high
priest addressing leda

  the girl nodded with hau-
teur and drew herself upright like a
queen on her throne

   i thought it best to come myself he
explained as he approached her and seat-
ed himself at her gesture on the nearest
divan i have had a long talk with my
grandson  you will pardon me i

know if i seem distrait but ive just had
a most saddening disillusion  a dis-
appointment   

  the entire party looked curiously at the
old man as he all at once bowed his face
into his hands while his shoulders shook
convulsively slowly ledas eyes sought
henry winchs puzzled thoughtful face

  my grandson-i-i only discovered it
today-is not at heart one with us here
in our dedication to the higher happiness
of the world he is young and ambi-
tious said the priest apologetically

  in a word interrupted doaor pea-
body dryly you have found that your
grandson wishes power to gratify his own
ambitious projeas whatever they may
be

  the high priest nodded lifting his
face from his hands the fire had gone
from his eyes that all at once looked tired
and worn

  i have actually been obliged to warn
the initiates that under no circumstances

this story begun in weird talks for october


weird tales

shall they obey his slightest command
this has been as you may well under-
stand a most severe and painful ordeal
for me

  are all the initiates with you asked
henry winch with sudden penetration
if they are all may yet be well with your
plans but isnt it possible that quint
may have among them certain adherents
who incline to his way of thought

  this i have already considered al-
though it is difficult for me to believe that
an initiate can do other than work toward
world betterment selflessly still quints
example is enough to startle me into be-
lieving that there may well be as you say
others-

  the old doctors lips compressed he
looked fixedly at the high priests appar-
ently honest face then nodded as if satis-
fied with what he read there

  how do you manage to open those
solid glass walls burst in larry as if
unable longer to control himself

  that is easy my son said the high
priest and he spoke in a lighter tone as
if glad to abandon a topic of conversa-
tion that could not but be painful to him
it can be done very simply even by com-
paratively untrained minds by directing
at the wall one of those bulb-tipped
wands you have seen in the hands of our
people

  you point the bulb at the wall direct
your thoughts along it until they reach
the tip and if you have succeeded in put-
ting all else out of your mind for a few
seconds except the one thought that the
wall must open to you the thing is done
simple

  larry weaver smiled triumphantly
the rest of the party knew why he was
so pleased the way out had been found
it would be easy to get one of the bulb-
tipped wands from an attendant   

  but how did you make the glass pla-

teau pursued larry i must say thats
beyond me

  very much in the same manner but
the details are too many for me to explain
just now wearily answered the priest
to make a long story short all that ex-
ists comes from the same basic material
and it in turn is merely different arrange-
ments of molecules and atoms vibrating
at various rates the knowledge of how
to control that rate of vibration gained
by deep study and deeper occult experi-
ence gives the power to control the rate
of vibration which produces matter in all
its various forms

  then you created that glass plateau
the walls this city by your force of will
and your knowledge how to direct it
to bring into material form this glass
fortress was the least of our tasks re-
plied the priest and he smiled slightly

  about our getting away from here
larry began again briskly taking the
initiative for the party i understand
from miss scudder that you are perfectly
willing that we should all go

  all but the young lady herself hast-
ily said the priest she must be detained
for she is absolutely necessary for bur fur-
ther progress in our experiments up to
her graduation last june i may remark
we had her watched constantly to make
sure of her indomitable will her strong

character her tendencies her-

  good lord larry interrupted pi-
ously spied upon all the time   
how pleasant well as to the rest of us
you are willing that we should go
why not you may go whenever you
so desire acceded the priest earnestly
he turned to leda are you perfectly
resigned maiden to your high part in
what is to take place

  leda nodded shortly and he appeared
satisfied

  the queen shall be ready on the
plateau whenever you say you people
the portal to power



can all go this afternoon if you choose
i would like to go up to see that the
ship is in perfect order for flying larry
said craftily with a dark glance under his
heavy brows this too ready compliance
had evidently aroused his suspicions

  go with me when i leave here and
fly her up yourself if you please offered
the high priest quickly meeting suspi-
cion with frankness she is helicopter-
equipped and you from your experience
would have no difficulty in getting her
out above the river and up to the plateau
in fact he added thoughtfully some
sudden idea evidently striking him with
misgivings i think it might be better for
you to take her out instead of-instead
of my grandson he ended a kind of
break in his voice and he dropped his
eyes unhappily

  thats all o k then agreed larry
his alert glance running around the party
and then i come down here again
leda took a hand at this point her
face serious

  let them all go now said she firmly
avoiding their eyes

  what cried henry winch larry
and old job simultaneously

  i am afraid their presence might dis-
tract me leda complained to the high
priest with disarming simplicity

  her uncle gave a loud groan he knew
what she was trying to do she would sac-
rifice her own possible escape in order to
get the rest of them their liberty

  i shall not go one step said he with
determination meeting the high priests
sad eyes until ive seen the whole cere-
mony whatever it is i shall not leave my
niece until ive seen with my own eyes
that she has truly accepted her part in
your plans and that it is indeed a part
that will protea her from harm

  loud exclamations of agreement arose
from the rest of the party and leda was

obliged to subside gracefully with a
shrug of her young shoulders

  i only want it understood said she
that i am taking on myself willingly
the part of high priestess to the higher
powers i believe that you and she ad-
dressed the priest and your initiates are
sincere in wishing for the worlds happi-
ness and being sane i would like to see
such a desire succeed

the old priest smiled at her for the
first time in the interview something
like tranquillity came into his face his
eyes remained on the girls face hopefully

  now that you have willingly dedi-
cated yourself to this most tremendous
service to mankind i personally shall see
to it that no harm touches you or yours
with all that my misguided grandson has
gained in knowledge of secret things yet
am i more powerful more learned he
declared earnestly trust yourself to my
guidance maiden and you will become
the most renowned human being who
has yet lived on this sad earth you will
become the instrument for the highest
good and the utmost happiness to the
human race

  i can not see all at once cried out
gemma how you dare say that you only
want to do good to the world when you
have let loose upon it the terrible pan
he is cruel sensuous without any moral

sense-

  she had put her finger directly upon a
weak spot and the entire party looked ex-
pectantly at the high priest

  it was our first attempt at drawing a
higher power down into mortal form he
admitted unwillingly and we had not
then the portal to power he added
we were unable to raise our invocations
in vibration to a high enough pitch and
then maintain them there without the
talisman now that we have it we are
prepared to make entry for powers that


weird tales

stagger the attempt at description he
finished enthusiastically

  he actually believes it himself whis-
pered larry to henry winch who
nodded without removing his fixed gaze
from the old priests face

  the pilot addressed himself to the
priest again

  if there is nothing more you can tell
us you might take me along now to get
the queen

  then your plans-

  we will attend die ceremonies to-
night by all means decided the doctor
with firmness looking not at the priest
but at leda as he spoke we intend to
see with our own eyes this calling down
onto the earth plane of higher powers
after the ceremonies are over and we
know that the young lady is safe and that
the happiness of the world has been
secured said he with a slightly ironical
intonation we will go on our way   
unless we find it to the worlds greatest
benefit to cast in our lots with you
perhaps you may do that indeed
cried the priest with every appearance of
pleasure at the idea there are great
souls among you i can feel that in-
tuitively it would mean but little
preparation for you sir for example
said he to the doctor to prepare your-
self for fuller initiation and hence for a
high post in the coming dispensation
does not the bible say something
about him who would be first hinted
the doctor significantly

  the priest had the grace to color a
little

  we shall of course have to await
the word of the higher powers as to any
appointments he replied with dignity
but i felt that being at the head of this
tremendous movement and next in
authority to our future high priestess i
might have some little influence with
them

  it all sounds to me sir like a de-
cidedly earthly revolution observed
doctor peabody tartly

  it has to begin with matter doesnt
it retorted the high priest when we
have opened matter to the influx of
spirit we can start living on a more
spiritual plane

  you may be right but you sound all
wrong to me the doctor sighed well
tonight should show us much of inter-
est

  tonight you shall see this maiden
lifted into higher power and veneration
than any earthly woman has ever been
raised promised the priest solemnly
and you shall see the beginning of a
new world i promise you i know it
must be so my faith my desire my will
all-all are engaged in this high em-
prise

  let us hope that all will come to pass
as god may will returned the doctor
dryly

  gemmas voice cried out at them then

  you are all talking and talking she
exclaimed and youve forgotten poor
captain if were going to leave here we
shouldnt forget him

  shes right leda said briskly he
doesnt amount to much certainly but he
must come with us that is she cor-
rected herself as the priest gave her a
sharp glance that is he must be sent to
join us now and remain with the party
until they go

  righto henry winch seconded her

  he can come back with me said the
pilot

  the priest rose then all is satisfac-
torily explained and arranged

  a half-smile flitted over larrys face
henry winch scowled

  all that is necessary for now said
the doctor gravely

  then it might be well if the maiden
the portal to power



took some sleep for the ceremonies will
start just before midnight

  beckoning to larry to follow the high
priest went out

  the old doaor drew a breath of relief
well it looks as if things were turn-
ing out to our advantage in spite of the
probable loss of the talisman said he

  what made you block my plans
whispered leda crossly you could have
sent police-lots of people-for me later
if youd gone away right now

  yes sarcastically answered henry
winch if you think we are going to
leave here for the hours it might take us
to get help and meantime abandon you
to the questionable mercy of these-well
-lunatics youve got another guess com-
ing leda

  doaor peabody intervened

  youd better try to eat something my
child and get a good sleep he sug-
gested gently in faa i imagine if we
all took turns in keeping short watches-
although i hardly think it necessary now
-we could all get some sleep we need
it and we may have severe strains on
our bodies and minds before this night is
over and we are in aaual safety again
gemma fell to sobbing hysterically
again

chapter 

it lacked an hour to midnight when
quint at the head of a gorgeously ap-
parelled cortege appeared as escort for
ledas gilded litter she it appeared was
to head the procession and behind her
special bodyguard the rest of the party
might walk

  old job kissed his niece with particu-
lar tenderness as he and henry winch
assisted her into the litter doaor pea-
body however observed that it was to
the secretary that the parting pressure of
her hand was given although her eyes

did not meet the young mans beseech-
ing gaze

  the ebon-skinned bearers lifted the lit-
ter and moved slowly away with measured
steps into line behind and about them
fell the glittering cortege of attendants
each with a bulb-tipped spear at these
slender wands the greedy eyes of larry
weaver looked longingly and seeing
this the doaor was obliged to tap the
pilots arm in warning

  just the same muttered larry id
like to get hold of one right now seems
to me that if i sent my wishes along one
it might do a trifle of execution right
here and now besides opening glass
walls

  your surmise may be right-and it
may be wrong young man said the doc-
tor severely as the two strode along with
the rest of the party captain limping
somewhat in the rear on his small foots
about which he occasionally uttered a
mournful complaint

  oh my foots my foots mus git me
anudder spell

  if im right couldnt i send this
bunch of fellows about their business and
get us headed for the plateau the
queen is up there all set and rarin to
go

  you might succeed larry and again
think what it would mean to us all if you
didnt it is within the limits of possi-
bility that those spears are only to open
walls said the doaor dryly

  larry made a wry face

  just the same id like to make a try
at it

  later it might be forced upon us to
make a try at it said the doaor and
sighed heavily as he walked along

  henry winch had attached himself to
job scudder and the two were talking
earnestly in low tones as they marched
behind ledas litter

  if ever we get out of here the sec-


weird tales

retary said in a slightly louder voice
his emotion overcoming his caution
til-

  silence came from quint at the head
of the column we are approaching the
inner temple of the most high gods

  the floors had changed from golden
glass to opalescent and milky beauty that
seemed indeed jewels of various hues
sunken into invisible settings beneath
their feet tall pillars of the same opal
hues upheld the vaulted ceiling that
completed the austerely simple interior of
the inner temple

  down a long aisle the procession
marched to a humming murmur from
the throats of hundreds of kneeling men
and women who were scattered here and
there in small groups between the
columns of the temple this murmur in-
creased in volume as they proceeded
until it became almost intolerable to the
ear for it carried a regular rhythmic beat
in its undertones that hammered on the
ear like the heavy pulsing measures of
african-derived jazz

  in that shimmering moon-like glow
the cortege passed upward on a slight in-
cline that led to a mammoth portal
before which hung tall tapestries in silver
gold and jewels at the approach of
ledas gilded litter the curtains drew to
one side and the doctor and larry
weaver exchanged quick glances of com-
prehension they had seen the foremost of
the escort directing their bulb-tipped
wands at the hangings as they drew near

  so it was that easy said larrys look
scornfully but the old doctors grave
countenance did not look as triumphant
as the airmans

  into the slight opening made by the
withdrawal of the curtains the procession
continued and at last the members of the
party also marched within behind them
the draperies dropped back into place si-
lently without touch of human hand

they were standing in a smaller room
floor ceiling walls all of gloriously
veined black marble an altar of what
appeared solid gold gleamed dully near
the rear of the room behind it was a
great gold and jewelled chair on such
high legs that it had to be mounted by
means of steps at one side beneath the
chair a golden brazier stood and from
it curled upward spiral wreaths of pale
bluish-gray smoke that twisted and
swayed as the currents of air induced by
the entrance of the company now set
upon it from all sides

  oddly pungent odor murmured
henry winch to old job sniffing the air
suspiciously it actually gives one a sort
of exalted feeling what

  the magnate nodded slowly his nos-
trils dilated for the smell of that smolder-
ing incense in the golden brazier re-
minded him of something that his mind
vainly attempted to capture for several
minutes all at once he had it   

  delphic oracle he whispered por-
tentously to the secretary then do
they actually intend to have leda sit up
there in those heavy fumes

  henry winch grasping the signif-
icance now of that strangely intoxicating
perfume and the strategic position of the
brazier felt the blood forsaking his
tanned cheeks

  thats-thats ghastly he murmured
sotto voce to job we cant allow that
those fumes turn ones head-it makes
one - crazy if that is what they

mean- and he lapsed into silence

but it was not the silence of realized im-
potency for something about the way his
lips writhed back from his even white
teeth betrayed the thoughts that must
have been passing in his mind

  yes-theres no doubt about it-
thats exactly what they intend to do
groaned old job as he grasped the sec-
retarys arm convulsively
the portal to power



  henry winch took a step forward his
lips parting as if he would cry out in pro-
test he found himself checked by the
severe face of the old doctor whose hand
was warningly on his shoulder

   not so fast young man not so fast
said the doctors low voice

  but to have them using leda in their
ghastly experiments

  now is not the time to interfere
warned the doctor i give you my word
as a medical man that no harm will come
to leda from this exposure to the fumes
of those herbs and spices the whole
thing is suggestible she may not even
yield to it if her whole mind is set upon
retaining her own consciousness and in
that case said he thoughtfully i doubt
if she will be chosen as high priestess
for the whole aim here is to undermine
the personal will of the priestess so that
other outside wills can make their entry
into her body to control her actions and
her voice

  interesting but not convincing
enough to hold me back the secretary
replied in the same low voice so we
are to wait here to see whether or not my
poor girl succumbs to the influence of
the incense

  his poor girl thought the doctor
but said nothing aloud

  there is nothing to be done at this
particular moment larry joined in soft-
ly he had been listening to the others in
silence how could we ever make our
getaway through that bunch out in the
big room and with the rest of the bunch
in here

  henry winch nodded impatient ac-
quiescence larry was right there was
nothing for it but to await the event
and the event was on the forward march

from a doorway in the black marble
toward the rear of the room a golden
door swung open and the high priest

entered the room for a moment he stood
motionless his arms raised in a benedic-
tory manner then he gestured to the men
of the escort who one by one slipped out
into the main auditorium through the rich
hangings leaving in the inner sanctuary
only the high priest quint and the mem-
bers of the little party from the queen
yet that there was some one else near
at hand became evident when from
beyond the open doorway sounded the
light tapping of pans hoofs

  gemma her eyes enormous with ter-
ror hastily stuffed her handkerchief into
her mouth to muffle her gasping sobs
sir hubert moved unobtrusively nearer
her his eyes on her pale face

  behind them wilted the corpulent form
of the black chef his small eyes peering
out from the folds of flesh full of fear
that he understood something of the
significance of the scene could not be
denied yet his fright had so robbed him
of ability to use any mental processes
that all he could do apparently was to
stand there muttering beneath his breath
mus git me anudder spell mus git me
anudder spell

  shut up captain whispered larry
fiercely shoving one doubled fist under
the chefs snub nose

  captain shrank back but continued to
mutter softly his eyes on the jewelled
breastplate the high priest wore

  the priest seeing that the last mem-
ber of the escort had left the room as-
sisted leda from the litter

   your place maiden is here said he
indicating the tall golden chair you
need do nothing but lean back quietly
and relax

  hastily the old doctor bent his head
over gemma and whispered

  tell your mistress-quickly-in ital-
ian-not to let go her hold on her con-
scious will for a single moment he said


weird tales

rapidly she understands italian doesnt
she

  the italian girl nodded and pulled the
handkerchief from her mouth a few
words in her native tongue   

  leda mounting the steps to the tall
chair hesitated a moment and then made
a slight-a very slight-affirmative move-
ment of her sleek dark head

  the doaor drew a long sigh of relief
she had understood that the message was
a warning for herself for her eyes had
been on his face as she gave th slow
nod but the high priest turned his face
disturbed and cried out at gemma to
remain silent or she would be sent out-
side gemma subsided whimpering but
meeting the doaors half-smile some-
thing of comfort must have stolen into
her heart judging from her expression

  lean back maiden the priest now
direaed leda relax let yourself go-
go-go   

  the low hypnotic drawl continued
and the priests smile told the doaor that
the pan-worshipper believed the girl had
let herself go completely for she had
settled herself in the chair with an air of
relief her eyelids drooping mysteriously
over her warm brown eyes as if heavy
with luxurious abandonment still the
old physicians faded blue eyes peered
through his bifocals fixedly and at last he
saw that one of her index fingers resting
on an arm of the chair was tapping
rhythmically then irregularly he drew
in a sharp breath she was doing in-
tuitively exaaly the right thing keeping
herself widely alert by a consciously
direaed physical movement

  i believe everything is coming along
all right whispered the doaor then to
encourage job who was in turn patting
the shoulder of the secretary in friendly
fashion

  lets hope so muttered henry

winch from one comer of his mouth
his brows were set in a heavy scowl

  the airedale on its leash held by the
secretary sniffed uneasily and paid no
attention to suki seated on his back
plainly whiskers was most uncomfort-
able more than once he had assumed
the unmistakable attitude of one about to
bay the moon and had only been aroused
and distraaed from his intent by the
jerking of the leash and his masters
sharp low order

  now the high priest spoke again to
leda removing as he spoke the jewelled
breastplate and laying it on the golden
altar

  maiden chosen of the most high
gods this is the moment to deliver to
the world the portal of power

  he stretched up a questing hand and
the girl with the air of a sleepwalker
fumbled in her bosom and drew out the
talisman as she let it drop into the high
priests waiting palm her whole manner
that of one overcome by irresistible
drowsiness the old doaor eyed her with
apprehension only that index finger tap-
tapping on the arm of the chair could
reassure him

  my admiration for leda grows by
leaps and bounds whispered he to old
job that child is wonderful   

  the air magnates impatient jerk of
heavy shoulders spoke of his proud ac-
ceptance of a tribute that he felt was
deserved

  the high priest now bent over the altar
and laid the talisman in the center of the
breastplate then he lifted both arms and
began to chant in a mixture of latin and
some other unknown tongue the mur-
murs from the great hall without dropped
when his voice rang out at each pause
responses came in a thunderous roar of
chanting voices that reverberated through
the small room echoing back and forth
the portal to power



loudly even when he began to speak
again

  his eyes were fixed on the gleaming
stone atop the altar occasionally he
would bend over it as if addressing some
part of his invocation directly to it on
such occasions it was plainly seen by all
the strained eyes observing him that
sparkles of brilliant light came from the
stone synchronizing with the resonant
tones of the old mans ringing voice at
such times also the clouds of incense
from the brazier appeared to thicken and
pour upward more heavily curling about
the girl in the tall golden chair until she
was momentarily hidden from sight
and when that happened the convulsive
grasp of henry winch on the arm of the
old doctor became so unconsciously cruel
that john peabody winced

  quietly-so quietly that they hardly
noticed his advent-the goat-man had
entered the room and moved close to the
golden chair above the smoking brazier
when he seated himself on one of the
rungs by which leda had mounted and
began surveying those present with his
sly cunning glances the doctor found it
difficult to restrain the secretary from
springing away from the party and going
to the other side of the altar as if to be in
readiness to protea leda in case of need

the tone of the incantation was
changing subtly something was
stirring arout the room that could not be
seen yet by mortal eyes although it could
now be felt by mortal senses the rhyth-
mic swing of the high priests chant and
the measured beat of the responses from
the initiates in the great hall seemed now
to shake the solid marble with regular
vibrations

  am i imagining it or is this marble
aaually vibrating under my feet de-
manded the secretary of the doaor softly

  it is vibrating it is the beginning of
the end replied the old doaor solemnly
their incantations are beginning to
work

  god but its uncanny

  it is the rousing of subtle powerful
influences from other planes that you are
feeling now whispered the doaor
they are beginning to stir with life
with the hope of entering onto this plane
once more through the devotion of their
worshippers and through the means
afforded by the talisman

  as he spoke the doaor regarded leda
with anxiety as if in answer to his
solicitude he saw her heavy lids move
ever so slightly and the warm brown
eyes he could have sworn regarded him
earnestly when one lid flickered in an
unmistakable wink he caught himself
smiling dryly the girl was awake alert
signalling to him her constant watchful-
ness he was satisfied that so far all was
well with her

  the heavy thrumming vibrations in-
creased steadily it was now as if the
entire room were swinging and moving in
all direaions simultaneously every mol-
ecule of marble appeared to be in rapid
vibration it was a sickening as well as a
frightening feeling

  gemma forgetful of her antipathy for
sir hubert was hanging on his arm her
face a greek mask of horror eyes wide
mouth squared sir huberts counte-
nance on the contrary was an odd mix-
ture of consternation and sheepish bliss

  now the high priest his face shining
his whole mien that of one who wel-
comes the joyful incomprehensible
stepped closer to the altar with waving
arms pan arose from his seat at the feet
of the girl and moved toward the altar
but his eyes did not leave ledas form
and there was a sniggering grin on his
sly face


weird tales

  behold great and beneficent powers
that lie beyond the veil of our dull human
senses behold the willing sacrifice
behold the virgin maid who lays her
chaste body upon your altar descend
high priestess and deliver yourself up
unto the most high gods will

  at that call leda scudders slender
body trembled visibly and henry winch
uttered a strangely choked sound between
tightly clenched teeth

  the girl arose slowly dreamily and
went down the steps of the golden chair
moved toward the altar behind which
must also have been steps for presently
she mounted steadily and stepped upon
the altar again with a shudder that they
all could note

  most high gods the living sacri-
fice

  white white flesh tittered pan his
eyes leeringly on the girls body

  red gushing blood jerked as if un-
willingly from the lips of quint whose
hand was fumbling about his garments as
if to seek something his eyes were
glowing with strange fires

  the high priest reached out and
plucked a dagger from his grandsons
girdle and in a voice of high rebuke ex-
claimed no blood i say we serve the
good not the evil gods

  the grinding of quints teeth could be
heard in the silence that followed for
the chanting from without had died
away to a low murmur of hammering
rhythm with a stamp of one foot he
turned his back to the party and from
under lowering brows regarded pan
fixedly

  under that look the goat-mans sly face
wakened his hairy hands reached out to
seize the nearer corners of the altar and
he lowered his tumbled head down upon
it close to ledas sandalled feet as if to
kiss them with his slobbering mouth

  henry winch uttered a low groan

  i kiss the pure feet of her who is to
bring us the messages of the most high
gods shrilled the high tittering voice
of pan virgin maid you are devoted
now and consecrated to the will of the
most high gods and to the will of pan

  the dark head moved forward until
the rumpled black hair fell back from the
forehead exposing two shining knobby
horns of blade

  henry winch began shaking as if
stricken by a palsy

  do you devote yourself maiden with-
out a single personal reservation de-
manded the high priests voice clearly
during a lull in the incantations from the
initiates without

  leda did not open her eyes wide but
seemed to assent sleepily

  the doctor was regarding her now
with anxious solicitude

  your white flesh-your red blood-
your virginity-all is at the service of the
most high gods maiden in whatsoever
mode they see fit to call upon them
pursued the high priest

  again leda appeared to give assent

  then all is prepared cried the priest
jubilantly the way is cleared for die
gods to enter come come high gods
enter this chaste tabernacle prepared for
your delectation

  i say this thing has gone far
enough rang out the voice of henry
winch

  silence irreverent and rash fool
shouted the priest

  pans head lifted from the altar in-
scrutable sly eyes moved to the secre-
tarys flushed angry countenance and
rested there

  hush boy for gods sake begged
the old physician

  hush nothing retorted the secre-
tary furiously think im going to stand
the portal to power



here and let god knows what obscene
forces take possession of my wifes body

   silence heavy and ominous   

   the high priest as if shot turned in-
credulous eyes upon the secretary

  those are startling words he said
with an effort words of ominous im-
port young man wife-did you say
wife

   no no cried leda passionately from
the altar

   but the secretary paid no attention to
her

   i said wife he asserted his blaz-
ing eyes going here and there as if daring
any one to dispute his word

  our arts have shown this woman to
be a virgin declared the priest heavily
it can not be that we have made any
errors in our calculations but-wife-
that can mean but one thing you must
prove your statement he flashed at the
secretary

  it is true you dare not deny our
marriage cried out henry winch direct-
ly to leda whose lips compressed as she
did not reply

  then it is true whispered the high
priest as if to himself and leaned against
the golden altar as if stupefied by the sud-
den revelation wife his wife

chapter 

tttife is what i said repeated

  v	v henry winch stubbornly any-
body got anything to say now

  that is no way to go about saving
leda young man john peabody re-
buked gravely do you realize what you
are saying

  apparently my word isnt enough
said the secretary bitterly mr scudder
be good enough to tell these incredulous
people what you know about the situa-
tion

   job scudder looked not at the rest of

the party but at his old friend as he
nodded reluctantly

   ive seen their marriage certificate
said he unwillingly

   certificate a certificate doesnt neces-
sarily make a wife you-winch-how
did this thing happen and how far has it
gone quint demanded significantly

  turning not to quint but to the old
doaor henry winch spoke rapidly
almost incoherently

  id just graduated and she came to
the prom and we-we fell in love at
least i did there was a bunch of us
making whoopee and some one dared us
to get married and we did

   i was spifflicated uncle job honest-
ly i was pleaded leda from the altar
her face pitiful ive been so darn
ashamed of myself since that ive thought
i could just die when i thought about it
and he lied to me about his name she
declared with a hard look at the secre-
tary or i think i might have forgiven
him

   the secretary groaned aloud

   i told her the truth at least half of
it said he wretchedly but shes been
hating me because she blames me for not
having held back from marrying her
how could i when i was mad over her
when i told her my name was hubert
wynne-

  what made you lie to me id stick
to a man i loved even if he were a-a
servant-if i thought him worthy of my
love

   i didnt lie i tell you henry winch
-or hubert wynne-turned his face to
her for a moment then addressed the
doaor again id just learned that id
come into the title my uncle from eng-
land whod come over for my gradua-
tion had died of apoplexy and i was
afraid leda might be influenced by the
title as it was she accused me of being


weird tales

an adventurer and said she never wanted
to see me again that was the morning
after we were married while the bunch
of us were breakfasting at a childs
restaurant

  oh sighed the girl on the altar
sickly so you came after me masquer-
ading as a servant

  i hoped-oh i know now that i was
a fool--that you might realize my devo-
tion and learn to love me for myself i
see now that it was nothing but a crazy
dream

  i dont know about that said the
girl spiritedly

  what do you mean what-

  her cheeks were reddening but her
smile must have held some happy mes-
sage for sir hubert-the real sir hubert
-upon whose countenance an answering
brightness grew

  as the two stared at each other in the
silence that still hung over the little room
the real henry winchs voice sprang into
loud prominence

  i tell you gemma shelp me youre
the only girl i ever wanted to marry see
you wouldnt believe me when i said my
name was henry would you

  if you liked me so well why did you
go away after that night we met in the
waiting-room at the prom and never
come back

  his fault whisked me off in a hurry
and then made me pretend i was him
muttered the valet anyway you didnt
give me your address

  gemmas mouth opened wide thats
true henry i forgive you

  what is all this idiotic balderdash
exclaimed quints voice impatiently is
leda scudder a wife or not

  i tell you ive seen her marriage cer-
tificate retorted job with resentment
pan uttered a mighty shout most unlike

his usual tittering laughter it was the
uproarious laugh of triumph

  a wife the high priestess is no high
priestess she is a wife

  he reached up hairy arms and grasping
leda about the knees lifted her down
from the altar still uttering bellows of
wild laughter

  good lord what is he trying to
do demanded old job his eyes pro-
truding with amazement and appre-
hension

  there is no sacred virgin here
shouted the goat-man with another great
peal of mad laughter that rang and re-
sounded in the little room then she is
mine for the taking come girl for pan
has much to teach you and he tried to
draw her away with him toward the
golden door

  leda struggled in his grasp as he held
her tighter and gloated upon her with
wild beastly eyes in which glinted cruelty
as well as mischief

  take your filthy hands off my wife
shouted sir hubert springing fiercely to
the rescue

he had almost reached her side when
between himself and the girl he
loved pushed something black obscene
leering horrible    like a huge gorilla
filled with pulsing power and animal
emotions the negro chef interposed him-
self with irresistible power in front of sir
hubert and seized the fainting form of
leda from pans suddenly yielding arms
the goat-man retreated in a kind of
astonished confusion

  doctor doaor did you see what
captain did aied out larry into the
doaors ear

  dont talk weve got to check this
madness at once have you the pistol
demanded job scudder

  blood must not be shed declared the

                    w t-
the portal to power



doctor positively we must try to save
her by some other means if possible
there is dread evil abroad and freshly
shed blood would only call it closer

  but - doctor - captain - the fat

fool- stammered larry excitedly

he stole the talisman didnt you see
him

  good god ejaculated the doctor
he stole it then heaven help us all
for the powers of evil may enter now un-
obstructed even now-

  he started across the room colliding
on his way with the high priest his ears
attuned to hear whatever might have the
slightest bearing on the situation were
perhaps the only ones in the room to take
in the priests cry as the latter ran out-
side the hangings it was a cry that bade
the murmuring initiates stop their en-
treaties and reverse the spells they had
started it was a cry that told them that
the entry onto the world-plane must be
blocked at once to incoming powers it
was a cry that warned them of something
unforeseen that had happened

  captain-leering horrible his wide
white teeth showing in a terrible grin of
defiance-sustained the drooping form of
leda over his left arm and with his
clenched right fist in which was the
talisman he held off the entire party now
attacking him from various motives

  give me the talisman you fat fool
quint was shouting in a furious voice
keep the girl but give me the stone
no you dont fella came larrys
voice striking down the hand of quint
that reached out to snatch the talisman
from captains fist hey captain old
fellow give it to me

  captain however had become in truth
transformed like an ugly gorilla he
stood at bay now hugging leda against
his breast with an air of defiance the
small deep-set eyes that squinted out at
w t-

them held something more than a simple
human will they were sparkling with
malevolent consciousness of power   

  about the negro chef surged and
swirled those heavy vibrations that had
been started into being by the incanta-
tions of the initiates he had become by
his theft of the stone a nucleus for the
embodiment of evil powers the sly leer
of pan and his slightly disappointed air
spoke louder than words moreover the
air hung heavy with portent thrumming
and buzzing with the movement of in-
telligently directed forces strange un-
canny   

   sir hubert vainly attempting to wrest
ledas inert form from the possessed cap-
tain cried aloud in anguish the aire-
dale finding the leash loose was nipping
about captains ankles suspiciously occa-
sionally dodging a mighty kick directed
at him by the growling transformed
negro chef

  what a fool i am god what a fool
larrys voice rang out in a kind of frenzy

   quint still struggling to open the fat
fist that held the talisman fell back
before the sudden approach of the air-
man who had been fumbling in his
pockets with very apparent excitement

  what on earth did i do with it
larry was talking aloud as he fumbled
then his nervous look changing to one
of triumph he dashed at captain con-
fidently captain old chap look give
me that silly stone old fellow look i
picked it up where you dropped it
venuss rabbits foot captain ill swap
it for the stone

  the leering monster lowered upon
larry who held something out eagerly
and insistently still he made no move to
deliver up the talisman

  leda stirred opened her eyes man-
aged to get her feet to the ground and
stand although still in the grasp of the


weird tales

fat chef shuddering she strained away
from him and at larrys desperate in-
sistence she realized what had occurred

  take it captain she murmured her
body trembling in his grasp give the
stone to larry captain hell give you
your venuss rabbit foot captain take
it captain give larry the stone-

  at the continued repetition captains
leering face turned downward upon what
lay in larrys hand he reached out his
fist opening it to drop the stone onto
larrys palm at the same time grabbing
at the furry talisman the pilot proffered
he let leda go automatically and an ex-
pression of bliss spread over his fat face
from which the ugly leer slowly faded

  sir hubert had drawn the girl into his
arms and she rested there supinely her
head against his breast the young noble-
man looked as if he were in paradise he
was blind to whatever else was going on
about them his cheek rested on ledas
dark head his eyes were half closed old
job regarding the pair felt moisture
dimming his own eyes

  muttering joyfully to himself captain
waddled slowly to another part of the
room unobserved now that he was no
longer the horrid center of attraction
between his cupped palms he was hold-
ing the rabbits foot

  the talisman in his left hand larry
was confronting quint whose heavy and
powerful body poised itself in the act of
springing upon him

  no you dont warned larry softly
and took out his automatic with a sar-
donic grin

  an ugly look darkened quints face
he hesitated

  makes you think fella laughed
larry lightly now youre going to
think some more march ahead of me to
the curtains there and call in one of
those men with the spears

   cold fury in quints eyes   

  hear me fella you march and keep
your trap shut or ill bore a coupla holes
in you larry threatened genially

  a moment later quint was gesturing
the attendant to retire and larry with a
jerk of his head beckoned the doaor to
his side

   heres one of those things doctor to
open the walls said the pilot guardedly
youd better take it you know some-
thing about these performances and i
dont now wed better vamoose which
way is out fella the airman asked of
quint

   quints smile was sardonic in turn

  if you wish to walk around until the
golden wall blocks your egress quint
observed sarcastically you certainly are
at liberty to do so as far as i am con-
cerned you can reach the street from
the corridor that door opens upon from
there you can easily see which way to go
and he uttered a short scornful laugh

   thatll be all fella folks attention
doaor for the lords sake wake up these
lovers groaned larry disgustedly sur-
veying the two absorbed groups

  sir hubert caught the tone and looked
up slowly then his eyes became alert
and he whispered to the girl in his arms

  friends said the doaors low but
penetrating voice we must make haste
for we do not know how long we may
be able to command our own aaions
listen   

  the charaaer of the measured rhyth-
mic humming from the great hall had
altered subtly

  everybody on their way larry
direaed pointing to the exit ive got
the gun and ill keep em off while the
rest of you make the getaway

  larry for gods sake be careful
warned the air magnate apprehensively
if anything happens to you well all be
the portal to power



stuck on the plateau the queen is use-
less without a pilot

  dont be afraid mr scudder i
understand and will be very careful re-
plied the airman

  his eyes sought those of sir hubert
who came toward him with leda the
two men clasped hands for a moment
looking into each others eyes in silent
exchange of some secret message

  after you my dear gaston mur-
mured larry then with a sharp glance at
quint who was lounging against the altar
with apparent lack of interest in proceed-
ings

  hurry larry said the girl gently
and walked rapidly away urged by sir
huberts hand under her elbow

thb entire party disappeared through
the door and larry could hear their
echoing feet on the marble pavement
the airedale was last to go sniffing at
larry in a puzzled manner before frisk-
ing off through the door suki clinging
to its bade the pilot gave his attention
then to the indifferent lounging figure of
quint

  now said he persuasively i won-
der how long ive got to keep you here
perhaps the best thing will be to march
you ahead of me for a short distance
all right fella forward march

  and with quint arms held high
marching ahead the airman walked out
of the altar room and down the long
corridor gained the street holding his
gun on quint steadily

  ahead mounting the staircase that led
to the golden glass wall the rest of the
party appeared whiskers scampering
before them larry hastened his steps

  let you go back in a coupla minutes
fella he announced his eyes on the old
doctor who was holding a bulb-tipped
wand toward the wall while the balance

of the party stood behind him motionless

  after a moment larrys grin became
triumphant

  seems all right now fella

  damnation exclaimed quint venom-
ously seeing the golden glass recede in
thick folds upon itself opening the way
to the party

  for you perhaps retorted larry
still cheerful now you can get along
back and do what you please fella im
going with the rest of the bunch itll
take you a while to get any of your peo-
ple on our track and before you can get
to the plateau well be on our way

  quint dropped his arms as the airman
passed him on a dead run but the ugly
vindictiveness of that heavily handsome
face had never shown so clearly he
waited until larry had slipped through
the golden wall then also running fol-
lowed speedily on the airmans heels

chapter 

it was not until larry was ascending
the tortuously winding staircase of glass
that he became aware that quint was fol-
lowing close behind

  keep off fella he shouted once and
waved the automatic in warning

  quint paused until a turn of the stairs
hid him from view then came on gain-
ing little by little on his quarry

  hearing the approaching thud of the
other mans feet on the glass behind him
larry panting with breathlessness urged
himself on turning the sharp corners so
fast that more than once he skidded and
felt his heart fail him as he almost slipped
backward down those glisteningly smooth
steps

  when upon turning an unusually
sharp corner he did stumble the ptlot
did not stop to retrieve the automatic that
had been jerked from his hand and had
slid bumping down to the beginning of


weird tales

the turn larry dared not stop if he re-
turned for the gun he might very well
collide with quint before regaining it or
quint himself might pick it up before
larry could do so also quint was more
than his match physically he felt thank-
ful that the jar had not made him lose his
hold on the talisman which his left hand
still held convulsively he cursed himself
inwardly for not having given the stone
to the doctor

  meantime quint came steadily on
and so it was that when larry weaver
emerged under the midnight stars it was
with his pursuer directly on his heels

  the party had reached the queen
and were all anxiously watching the top
of the stairs with the exception of cap-
tain who had retired precipitately to his
kitchenette into which he had locked
himself and his venuss rabbit foot rely-
ing quite as much upon a turned key ap-
parently as upon the charm

  when the panting airman emerged a
low murmur of relief arose from the lips
of all a murmur that changed to one of
dismay and apprehension as the squat and
powerful form of quint appeared almost
simultaneously the doctor and sir
hubert started across the plateau at once
but long before even their hurrying steps
could have reached the two men the
duel was on

  there were no words spoken each
man saved his breath for the struggle
which he knew must end in death for one
of them their eyes said that plainly to
each other as they came to grips larry
incommoded by the talisman which he
still held tightly in his left hand quints
utmost efforts were directed to seizing that
hand and wresting from it the portal to
power

  so the two men pressed against each
other like a single swaying unit strug-
gled writhed twisted on the verge of the

sheer descent to the canyon and the rush-
ing roaring waters of the colorado
below

  panting his left arm held high larry
hopefully watched the rapid approach of
his rescuers but he was too badly
handicapped he knew that before they
could reach him quint would have
wrested the talisman from him and could
only too easily be down the staircase and
away and below in an angle of the
stairs lay larrys automatic  the cards
were in quints hands

  keep it up larry well be with you
in a minute sir hubert was shouting as
he ran

  throw it almost screamed the quick-
witted old doctor throw it to me

  on the very verge of the precipice the
two men battled grimly in a dreadful
silence larrys arm was in quints grasp

in another moment- with a sudden

burst of will-power larry jerked his arm
from quints hold his hand flew back
over his head then forward-a glitter-
ing milky thing hummed through the air
to drop flashing at the doctors feet like a
fallen fiery comet

  the old doctor checked himself picked
up the talisman and quickly thrust it into
a vest pocket he would have hastened
onward again had he not been held back
by the sudden stop of sir hubert who as
he paused gave voice to an involuntary
groan of dismay and grief

  from the rest of the party no sound
came although even the dim starlight
could not hide the outcome of the strug-
gle from them

  larry had lost his balance in that last
frantic effort to keep the stone out of
quints grasping hand he staggered on
the edge of the plateau for a moment it
looked as if he would regain his equilib-
rium but the other man with a callous
fury gave him a quick push
the portal to power



   the pilot went toppling out into space
but not alone at the touch of that mur-
derous hand the airman made his last at-
tempt disdaining to make a vain effort
to regain his lost balance he actually
twisted his body in the air and seized
with a final straining effort the fingers
that were condemning him to death

  a laugh of triumph from larrys lips
as he disappeared from sight accom-
panied by a screamed curse from quint
who found himself condemned to follow
his victim into the whirling dashing cur-
rents of the river below

a silence heavy and mournful
reigned after those two cries of tri-
umph and despair the numbing knowl-
edge of larrys death and the realization
of what it meant to them all-apart from
the grief with which the gallant young
mans tragic end had oppressed them-
bowed every member of the party in hor-
ror and dismay

  poor gallant lad said the old
physician softly as he stood at the edge
of the plateau straining his eyes vainly
for any trace of the two who had dis-
appeared an instant before noble lad
loyal to the last

  there could be no finer epitaph
agreed sir hubert his voice trembling
slightly i know that better than any one
else here you see we had a long talk

this afternoon and i told him-

  leda had run to them and interrupted
her voice shaky with the sobs she could
hardly restrain

the

   hubert dont you think that per-
 haps-

   sir hubert shook his head

   they have gone forever dear the
 descent is sheer at this point their bodies
 have been whirled miles away by this
 time you do well to weep for him he
 added gently for he was a gallant man
 and he loved you nobly leda

   job coming up to them whispered
 anxiously to the doaor

   we are trapped here larry had the
 only weapon and hes gone and here
 we are trapped

   trapped sir hubert asked

   what good is the queen to us with-
 out a pilot

   larry knew that i have a pilots
 license that is why he didnt try to save
 his life but took the post of danger
 guarding our rear

   sir huberts voice grew suddenly
 hoarse and he turned his face away from
 his friends

   good-bye dear larry whispered
 leda and kissed her hand tearfully down-
 ward into the darkness that had swal-
 lowed the airman

   had there been human eyes observing
 later on they would have seen the
 queen hovering over the roaring tor-
 rent in the canyon while her passengers
 prayed silently for the gallant young man
 who had met death so suddenly so fear-
 lessly

   and then rising swiftly she took her
 way to the western coast bearing the
 portal to power on her wings

the avenging shadow

by arlton eadie

practising forbidden arts in mediaeval naples taso vitelli sought to outwit
the prince of darkness but he who sups with the devil
must have a long spoon

in spite of its imposing title die lo-
canda del leone doro was but a
mean single-stotied wine-shop half
hidden away in one of the reeking alleys
within a stones dirow of the molo of
naples and its landlord through long
years of residence amongst the lawless
lazzaroni of that waterside district had
developed a wise and prudent indiffer-
ence as to the character and occupation of
the queer customers who patronized his
house yet even he could not help cast-
ing more than one curious glance at the
tall black-browed stranger who for the
past two hours had been slowly and
thoughtfully sipping his wine in the dark-
est comer of the dimly illuminated room

  at first sight he had appeared to be
one of the mercenary soldiers who at that
period roamed the country selling their
services to any leader who was able and
willing to give gold for steel and this
impression was heightened by the shirt
of pliant chain-mail which covered the
upper portion of the strangers body no
less than by the very serviceable rapier
and dagger that hung within convenient
reach from his belt

  but the landlords sharp eyes noted
that the plume drooping from the wide
brim of his slouched hat was too bril-
liant and many-colored to have been
plucked from any bird native to italy
that the roughly dressed leather of die
high boots was still harsh with sea water
while the crimson hue of the wide volu-
minous cloak had been bleached to a
dingy brown on its more exposed parts


by a sunshine ever more vivid than that
which beats on the tyrrhenian shore

  the man might be one of those daring
adventurers who had sought to carve
their fortunes with their swords from the
el dorado of the newly discovered con-
tinents beyond the western ocean he
might be one of the ruffians who provid-
ed the fighting material of the slave-
driven galleys of genoa then recently
enlisted under the white and gold banner
of his most catholic majesty of spain
he might be one of the officers of the
swift heavily-armed corvettes flying any
flag or no flag at all which lay in wait
for the lumbering deep-laden treasure-
galleons bringing the spoils of the new
world to fill the depleted coffers of the
old he might be--

  the landlords sidelong glance en-
countered the gaze of two frowning eyes
which glowed in the shadow of the
strangers low-drawn hat-brim and some-
thing in the intensity of their fixed re-
gard caused a shiver of superstitious fear
to run down the beholders spine under
cover of the counter the landlord closed
the two middle fingers of his right hand
extending the remaining ones in the di-
rection of the stranger and at the same
time muttering a charm beneath his
breath dread of the evil eye was very
real and potent in those latter years of the
fifteenth century

  a few seconds later the first strokes of
midnight began to boom from the cam-
panile of the convent dell annunziata
and with a promptitude which suggested
the avenging shadow



that he had been awaiting the signal the
stranger drained his glass and rose brisk-
ly to his feet

  your reckoning messer host he
said in a deep ringing voice at the same
time tossing a silver coin on the counter

  the landlord spat upon the coin and
transferred it to the pocket of his greasy
apron

  mille grazie eccellenze he mut-
tered bowing his guest to the door with
obvious relief addio e buon viaggio
may the blessed madonna accompany
you every step of your journey

  a contemptuous smile twitched the
lips of die stranger as he noted that the
pious wish was accompanied by the sign
to avert the evil eye

  addio he answered curtly and
passed out into the night

  a few rapid strides along the alley
brought him into the wider strada di
chiaja where passing beneath the lofty
rock of pizzofalcone he began to mount

the sloping path beyond as he made
his way upward the huddled roofs of
the waterside hovels sank beneath his
range of vision revealing the magnificent
sweep of the bay of naples its placid
waters spread like a sheet of beaten sil-
ver beneath the moonlit sky directly
before him the distant island of capri
appeared like the head of some fabled
sea-monster rising from the deep to his
right its smoke-crowned summit faintly
tinged with red the purple-gray mass of
vesuvius loomed in solitary grandeur

  late though the hour was a few signs
of life and movement floated up from
the streets below-the flash of lanterns
and clink of armor as the watch went its
prescribed rounds the tinkle of a mando-
lin and the sound of a voice trolling
forth the inevitable funiculi-funicula
a burst of coarse revelry from a wine-
shop the sweet voices of the nuns as they
chanted their midnight orisons in the
chapel of the convent near by

stand ho he cried suddenly lowering the point of
his weapon


weird tales

  the latter sound seemed to awaken
some dormant memory for the man in-
stinctively raised his hand to his forehead
and began to make the sign of the cross
-only to pause abruptly with a snarling
curse as he recollected the errand on
which he was bent

  diavolo the whey-faced fools deem
the world well lost for the sake of an
empty dream he muttered as he turned
to resume his way but i am wiser than
they soon the world with all its pomp
power and riches will be at my feet

  as if the thought had invested him
with renewed energy he hastened up the
remainder of the slope at a run and a
few minutes later came to a halt before
a low door that was deeply recessed in a
wall of ancient stone with a quick
glance round to make sure he was unob-
served he thrust forward his sheathed
sword and rapped on the panels with its
hilt

  he had expected his summons to be
answered by a whispered challenge-the
grating of bolts-the creak of hinges
instead the heavy gate swung open as
silently as a dissolving shadow for a
second he hesitated peering suspiciously
into the darkness within in an endeavor
to discern the agency responsible for this
unspoken invitation to enter then he
stepped across the threshold and the door
closed behind him as mysteriously as it
had opened

the house which loomed before him
seemed devoid of life no sound is-
sued from within no glint of light
showed in its many windows but as he
approached a slender spear of yellow
light leapt to meet him it came from a
narrow grated peephole which pierced
another door inside illuminated by the
flickering beams of a taper a pair of
dark piercing eyes stared into his from
beneath their shaggy gray brows

  what seek ye signorino came in a
hoarse croaking whisper from the other
side of the door

  that which is forbidden was the
strangers cryptic reply

  of whom do ye seek the thing which
is forbidden

  of him whose name must not be
spoken

  and where does he dwell he whose
name must not be spoken

  in air and in earth in water and in
fire and in those unknown elements
which boil and seethe deep beneath the
foundations of the earth

  apparently the whole series of ques-
tions and answers formed an elaborate
countersign for the old man immediately
unlocked the door and motioned the
stranger to enter

  passing down a dark corridor he led
the way into a long narrow yet strange-
ly lofty apartment a row of slender
gothic arches ran down each side the
corbels which supported the groined roof
were sculptured in the forms of angels
the walls were covered with frescoes of a
sacred character the stranger recoiled
a pace as he saw the nature of his sur-
roundings

  a church the startled exclama-
tion was accompanied by a quick hissing
intake of his breath

  aye but an unhallowed one his
guide answered with a reassuring laugh
fear not signorino the black mass has
been the only ritual chanted within these
walls for many a long year time was
when this was the private oratory of the
noble family to whom this house be-
longed but now-behold

  he kindled a large lamp as he spoke
and by its light the newcomer saw that
the carved stonework was chipped and
cracked that the golden halos of the pic-
tured saints were tarnished and black-
ened the rich coloring of the figures de-
the avenging shadow



faced by damp or quite obliterated in the
places where the plaster had peeled from
the walls rough wooden shelves had
been nailed up at a convenient height
from the floor and on these were ar-
ranged queer-looking instruments earth-
enware jars glass flasks and retorts a
furnace of blackened brickwork stood on
the spot formerly occupied by the altar
before it stood a large table and an oaken
press which groaned beneath the weight
of the many huge leather-bound volumes
stacked upon it

   seating himself in a high chair at the
head of the table the old man leisurely
settled the folds of his long fur-trimmed
robe his eyes fixed upon the others face
the while in a prolonged hawk-like
scrutiny

  you are welcome taso vitelli he
said at last as one who comes with
the commendation of ramon ezaquiel of
malaga-

  per bacco the younger mans
eyes were filled with an expression deep-
er than mere astonishment as he rapped
out the words how know ye my
name-and that of the man who sent
me hither malaga is in spain-three
hundred leagues or more from here i
came direct yet it would seem as if the
news of my coming has outrun me

  a slow and scornful smile showed
faintly beneath the old mans beard

  think ye that i am but a bungling
tyro in the art of necromancy that my
only means of gaining knowledge is by
written word or messenger of flesh and
blood know ye not that i have power
to summon at my will aerial couriers
more swift than the lightning flash but
marvel not at such a simple thing-ere
long thou shalt know that such are but
trifles light as wind-blown down com-
pared with the weighty world-swaying
powers vouchsafed to the masters of our
craft let it suffice thee for the present

to know that such knowledge as ye seek
may be thine-at a price

  an ominous gleam shot from the nar-
rowed eyes of the master magician as he
uttered the final words but vitelli ap-
peared not to notice it as he eagerly
thrust his hand into the bosom of his
doublet and drew forth a leathern bag

  the price is here messer malecal-
chas he cried opening the bag and
pouring a stream of gold pieces on the
table will this suffice thee

  without answer the other drew die
glittering heap toward him shuffling the
coins with greedy fingers occasionally
taking one up and holding it nearer the
lamp the better to observe it although
all were of gold the coins varied greatly
not only in size and weight but also in
the devices they bore there were dutch
guilders french louis dor english no-
bles spanish doubloons-even a few
turkish sequins and a battered disk bear-
ing the half-obliterated chariot of ancient
syracuse

  methinks thy gold comes from many
different countries and they are all coun-
tries that send deep-laden ships from
their ports malecalchas observed softly
a man need not dabble in the black art
to divine that twas on the sea that thy
gold was won

  vitellis face darkened and he made
an impatient movement

  no matter where t was won is it
enough

  the old man nodded his head slowly
swept the coins into the bag tied die
mouth securely and locked it away in an
iron-bound chest

  it is enough he said returning to
his chair in return for it i agree to
make thee proficient in the mystic arts
but-he paused and stroked his long
beard-i have a-er-a kind of partner
in my college and he too must have his
fee


weird tales

  taso vitelli shrugged and turned
away i have no more money

  malecalchas held up a protesting hand

  nor is more needed the fee de-
manded by my-er-fellow-instructor-
is one that can not be paid in coin

  how then

  swear that thou wilt not divulge to a
living soul what i am about to tell thee

swear it by- and he propounded

an oath which caused cold beads of sweat
to start from his hearers forehead

  among taso vitellis late sea-roving
companions he had been credited with
fearing neither man nor devil but now
his voice was husky and shaking as he re-
peated the words of that soul-chilling
compact

  it is well said malecalchas at the
conclusion know then that on the eve
of the feast of saint walpurgis that is
to say the night between die last day of
april and the first of may all my stu-
dents assemble in the courtyard of this
house there they compete in a race
starting at a given signal and running
completely round the house the goal be-
ing a narrow postern door leading to the
vaults beneath this chapel and then
the old proverb becomes literally true for
the devil takes the hindmost in very
sooth

  the prospective student leapt up from
his chair

  you-mean- he faltered

  that the body and soul of the last
man to enter the door becomes forfeit to
the lord of hell

yitelli stood aghast as the dreadful
nature of the bargain rushed upon
his mind every instinct of his being
shouted its horrified warning to shun
even the remotest chance of paying such
a price then his face grew more com-
posed after all he was young mus-
cular lithe of limb and fleet of foot in

a fair contest of speed and endurance he
would stand as good a chance as any man
-a better chance than most

  he turned with a sudden question
how many of your students will take
part in this race

counting yourself a round score
vitellis face brightened twenty to
one-he had taken more desperate
chances than that in his reckless career
and had come through scatheless

  i agree he cried enroll me on
your list of students now

  malecalchas laid a restraining hand on
the others arm

  softly softly young signor first the
agreement must be ratified in due form
by the personage who is the other party
to the compact follow me

  he began to lead the way toward a
narrow flight of steps which led down-
ward into inky darkness but vitelli hung
back

  whither are you taking me he de-
manded

  into the presence of your future lord
and master come

  half eager half fearful vitelli suf-
fered himself to be led down the winding
stairs presently he found himself stand-
ing in what evidently was the ancient
crypt of the chapel darkness reigned
on every side

  here are flint steel and tinder said
malecalchas thrusting the articles into
his hand strike fire

  but the taper upstairs is burning

objected the other will not that-

  question not but obey the old man
interrupted harshly the fire must be
virgin fire struck by thine own hand
from the cold elements of nature other-
wise the spell is of no avail

  thus enjoined the neophyte in magic
busied himself with the implements and
after one or two attempts a tiny red line
of fire began to creep among the tinder
the avenging shadow



  fan it with thy breath then place it
in this brazier commanded the older
man

  vitelli obeyed and presently a faint
ruddy glow began to pervade the gloom
taking a piece of white chalk from the
pocket of his robe malecalchas drew a
wide circle on the stone floor completely
enclosing the brazier and the spot on
which they stood at the four cardinal
points he described weird cabalistic hiero-
glyphics muttering the while words
equally unintelligible rising to his feet
he again explored the depths of the ca-
pacious pockets of his robe drawing
forth four packets each carefully sealed
and bearing on its paper wrapping a
number written in ink

   thy task will be to cast these into the
brazier one after another as i shall call
the numbers inscribed on diem and i
charge thee as you wish to quit this vault
in human shape to use the packets in
their correct order and on no account
allow thy foot to pass beyond the mystic
circle i have drawn-nay not by so much
as a hairs breadth for beyond its pro-
tecting boundary there will soon be rag-
ing forces so strong and potent that even
i have no power to control them art
thou prepared

  taso vitelli took a long breath before
he answered

  aye

  then my fellcxw-traveler into the
realm forbidden to the sons of mortal
men brace up thy courage and make
strong thy heart for anon thou shalt
hear the voice that hath echoed through
the courts of heaven as well as the
deepest depths of hell the voice that
chanted with the angels of light before
the fallen lucifer raised it in mockery
over the torments of the damned hast
thou the packets set out in their proper
order

  aye vitelli answered after assuring
himself that it was so

  then begin with the packet marked-

one

vitelli cast the folded paper upon
the glowing charcoal in the brazier
and instantly the flames changed to a pale
greenish glow at the same moment
malecalchas drew out a parchment scroll
and began to read from it in a loud
sonorous voice

  years of close association with the
scourings of many nations who had been
his late shipmates had given taso vitelli
a smattering of many tongues but male-
calchas incantation was in a language
quite unknown to him yet in spite of
their hidden meaning the sustained roll
of the measured periods had a strange
wild music of their own suddenly
malecalchas paused

  two he commanded sharply with-
out turning his head

  vitelli flung in the second packet and
the dying flames within the brazier leapt
into renewed life but now they sent forth
a pale blue light which made the face of
each man appear like that of a living
corpse once more the deep-toned voice
of the master magician rose in the un-
holy litany once more it died away into
silence

  three

  a deep orange glow suffused the vault
as the third package touched the smolder-
ing embers vitelli dashed his hand
across his forehead to wipe away the
great drops which had of a sudden be-
dewed it was it merely the effect of
the burning drugs or was some stifling
heat-laden wind really circling round the
vault every breath he drew seemed to
come direct from a fiery furnace a dull
roaring filled his ears through which the
sound of the incantation came like a voice


weird tales

heard through the mists of raging de-
lirium

  arimanes    asmodeus    sam-
mael    sathanus

  the sorcerer raised his hands above his
head as he uttered each dread name and
to vitellis reeling senses it seemed as
though the flames in the brazier rose and
fell in unison as if fanned by a sudden
breath beyond the charmed circle in
which they stood the air seemed full of
beating wings confused sounds-sobs
wails curses in a thousand different
tongues mingled with shouts of demo-
niacal laughter-assailed his ears a
sultry wind began to stir the hair upon
his head its fiery breath searing deep into
the brain beneath

  he fell upon his hands and knees
trembling in every limb appalled at the
coming of the fiend he had invoked but
the voice of malecalchas shrill as the
scream of some unhallowed night-bird
recalled him to his duties

  four

  taso vitellis groping fingers found
and closed upon the last package al-
most blindly he cast it into the flames
and saw them change to a dull blood-red
whilst from them issued dense black
fumes that in an instant hid everything
save that leering red eye a low rumble
of thunder followed sounding faintly in
the distance at first but rapidly growing
louder and nearer until it burst in deaf-
ening crashes and peals about his ears

  then out of the sable cloud beyond
the circle a hand emerged and reached
toward him

  but was it a hand vitelli shrank
back as he fixed his staring eyeballs on
die apparition long slender but mus-
cular in color as black as soot save only
the curved blood-red claws with which
each finger was armed-it was the hand

of the arch-fiend himself extended to
him to seal his terrible bargain

  vitelli threw himself prone on the
ground and hid his face in his hands he
felt his right hand seized in a vise-like
grip-a pain like a red-hot iron pressed
to his palm

  then the din around him ceased
abruptly and when he took courage to
open his eyes it was to see malecalchas
calmly rolling up his scroll while he
rubbed out the magic circle with the sole
of his shoe it seemed as if no sign of
his diabolical assignation remained except
the slender spiral of vapor which still
trailed upward from the dying embers in
the brazier

  it was not until taso vitelli reached
the lighted room overhead that he saw
on his palm the ineffaceable brand that
was the seal of his pact with the enemy
of mankind

one evening some ten months later
when the afterglow of the early
spring sunset was still lingering in the
western sky a band of students trooped
noisily into the locanda del leone doro
at their head was the tall figure of taso
vitelli and this time the landlord did not
eye him askance

  bring wine for these my friends-
wine in plenty and of the best he or-
dered with a lordly air none of your
wretched chianti for us-vino dasti or
lacryma cristi-no baser vintage will
serve to gladden this night of nights
anon anon eccellenze

  mine host disappeared into his cellar
with the rapidity of a rabbit diving into
its burrow and returned almost as quick-
ly laden with huge dusty flagons glasses
were filled emptied and filled again and
as the contents of the flagons fell lower
the noise of revelry rose higher culmi-
nating in a chorus bawled so lustily as to
the avenging shadow



threaten to bring the crazy rafters tum-
bling about their heads

   amici alliegre magnammo e bevimmo
   fin che ri ci stace uoglio e la lucerna

    chi sa sa iatitro munno n ci vedimmo

    chi sa sa iautro munno n c e taverna

  it was but the common neapolitan
drinking-song in which the tippler bids
his friends eat and drink joyously as long
as there is oil in the lamp for who
knows if we shall meet again in die next
world or that we shall find a tavern
there

   but in spite of the noisy mirth and
wine-whipped excitement there lay heavy
on each heart a haunting dread which the
fate-defying words of the song only
seemed to accentuate for it was st
walpurgis eve and ere many hours the
race would be run which would decide
which of them was to pay the devils
debt

   vitellis laugh was loudest of any-
but it did not extend farther than his lips
his eyes were very watchful as he swept
his gaze round the circle of flushed faces
wondering which of them was destined
to provide the devil with his due would
it be haller the heavily built fleshy teu-
ton whose natural scantiness of breath
would not be improved by his present
potations or rodrigo the sicilian or
matteo the gipsy who had robbed a
church to pay his entrance fee or
corenzio who had sprained his knee a
few days before

  his gaze remained fixed upon the
rather handsome face of the last-named
student yes of a surety corenzio
would be the last man to pass through
the fatal door-what chance would a
half-lame man stand in a race for such a
desperate stake a feeling of deep sat-
isfaction came over vitelli at the thought
for the removal of the handsome coren-
zio would rid him of his only rival for
the favors of the dark eyed neinissa the

daughter-and heiress-of the richest
banker in naples that he himself
might prove to be the unlucky loser never
for an instant crossed vitellis mind

  at eleven oclock taso rose to his feet
he had been careful to drink much less
than his companions preferring to keep a
clear head and steady feet for die coming
race but he simulated the thickness of
speech of a man far gone in liquor as he
cried

  fill your glasses comrades there is
time for one last toast before we go to
keep our-little appointment

  corenzio started to his feet with a
drunken laugh

  let me fill the glasses taso-maybe
tis the last service ill be able to render
to this company

  secretly elated at the confirmation of
his estimation of corenzios slender
chance in the coming contest vitelli
nodded indifferently when each glass
was full to the brim he rose in his turn

  let each drink to his own success
he cried as he held the ruby goblet aloft
and a pleasant damnation to the loser
a few minutes later the party were
making their way back to the house on
the hill the merriest among them taso
vitelli but his laugh would have been
less loud and his step less jaunty had he
known of the tiny pellet which corenzio
had stealthily dropped into his wine as
he had charged his glass for the final
toast

that night the coldly glittering stars
looked down on a strange scene be-
ing enacted in the courtyard of malecal-
chas house a score of men stripped to
shirt and trunk-hose stood lined up with
their backs against one of the encircling
walls their straining eyes fixed on the
lantern held by the aged necromancer

  the course of the race will be once
round the house and through the narrow

weird tales

door leading to the crypt malecalchas
was explaining i will give the signal
to start by blowing out die candle of this
lantern then you will run in die dark-
ness to the winning-or perhaps i should
say the losing-post for it will be from
the last man that the penalty will be exact-
ed the patron of die race being who he
is any trick any subterfuge any artifice
will be permissible for the father of all
knavery will not forbid his followers to
practise his precepts in this momentous
contest it is each man for himself-and
the devil take die hindmost are you
ready

  a hoarse chorus of affirmation rose
from the tense rank

  then watch the candle

  twenty pairs of straining eyes were
fixed on him as he unfastened die door
of the lantern raising it until the flame
of the taper within was but a few inches
from his lips for a full minute he
stood motionless his satyr-like features
illuminated by die yellow glow each
man crouched down for the first forward
spring as they saw his lips purse up
abrupdy the light disappeared and the
next moment the darkened courtyard re-
sounded with the noise of madly racing
men

  taso vitelli sure of his victory ran
easily at first he had intentionally
taken up his place next to corenzio so
that he might enjoy to the full the despair
of his rival when the line of men
dashed forward vitelli allowed the limp-
ing man to pass him then fell in behind
him confident of being able to outstrip
him any moment he chose but it was
not from choice that corenzio ran so
slowly the pain in his sprained knee was
getting worse unless the drug worked
quickly nothing could save him from be-
ing the last to pass the fatal threshold

  by this time they had rounded two of
the comers of the house and half the dis-

tance had been covered vitelli put on a
little spurt of speed which brought him
side by side with his rival so little had
the pace distressed him that he had breath
to waste in a mocking laugh

  how now friend corenzio what ails
thee he jeered thou art running
like a broken-winded mule that wears out
its last days staggering round an oil-mill
you used not to be so tardy when hasten-
ing to the arms of your beloved nein-
issa

  a breathless curse broke from the lips
of the other man

  wait-wait he gasped i will be
lying in her aims when thou art howling
in hell

  viteliis only reply was another laugh
running abreast with no sound save the
quick patter of their feet and their deep
breathing they rounded die third comer
of the house then vitelli began stead-
ily to draw ahead once he glanced back
as a fragmentary gleam of moonlight
through the drifting clouds lit up coren-
zios face and the look of despair which
he saw there told that the man had al-
most reached the end of his endurance

  farewell corenzio he called back
in very sooth thy race is nearly run
give my respectful salutations to his
satanic majesty when-

  his voice broke off in a little wonder-
ing gasp what was this deathly leth-
argy that was stealing over him a mo-
ment since he had felt fit to run for
miles now his legs felt like lead while
a mist seemed to rise and eddy before his
eyes causing him to stagger like a drunk-
en man corenzio saw him falter and
despair gave place to hope with a
painful effort he increased his own speed
until once more they were running level
neck and neck they rounded the last
comer vitelli staggering blindly and only
keeping to the track by occasionally
stretching out his hand to feel the wall
the avenging shadow



  corenzio saw his plight and a laugh
that was little more than a hoarse gasp-
ing croak issued from his lips

 ha taso-who is-the-broken-
winded mule-now

  maledizzione

  like lightning vitellis foot shot out
tripping up the other as he was about to
pass him both men fell together in a
confused struggling heap corenzio
threw off vitellis weakening grasp and
strove to rise but the other clung des
perately to his leg drew himself up and
still struggling the pair staggered toward
the door which was the goal of the race

  gasping cursing locked in an embrace
which each feared to break lest the other
should forestall him they fought their
way onward the brilliant light from
the open door lit up their swaying figures
throwing grotesquely elongated black
shadows behind them together they
reached the door each striving to enter
before the other the violence of their
struggles increased-they knew they
fought for something even more precious
than life itself

  for a time they remained wedged in
the doorway unable either to advance or
retreat then with a mighty effort
corenzio dashed the other mans head
backward against the stone with his
last remnants of strength he thrust the
stunned and helpless form of his rival
back then pitched forward and literally
fell through the doorway to his swim-
ming senses the harsh voice of malecal-
chas sounded like the sweetest music as
he declared

  the last in the race is taso vitelli-
and he must pay the price

the following evening-that of the
feast of st walpurgis-a solitary
wayfarer was making his way along the
coast-road which skirts the southeastern
shore of the bay of naples reaching

the little village of resina he turned
abruptly to his right and began slowly
and painfully to mount the road which
wound upward amongst the mounds and
hillocks of gray lava it was taso vi-
telli on his way to keep his last tryst

  many were the curious glances cast at
his cloaked figure as he passed through
the single street of the village and one or
two of the homeward-bound peasants
wished him the customary buono viag-
gio but of these he took no heed he
looked neither to the right nor the left
walking for the most part with his eyes
bent on the ground only at rare inter-
vals did he raise them and then it was to
gaze long and fixedly at the distant mass
of vesuvius which loomed ahead

  from a wretched tumbledown dbergo
at the end of the village there issued as
if in bitter mockery the chorus of the
same drinking-song that he had shouted
so defiantly but twenty-four hours before

chi sa sa vautro munno ri ci vedimmo

chi sa sa iautro munno n c e taverna

  with a shiver he realized the truth
which lay beneath the epicurean senti-
ment and he paused half minded to join
the merry company within but a will
other than his own seemed to control his
movements mechanically he turned his
back on the friendly twinkle of the lights
and fixed his eyes on the flame-tinted
cloud of smoke which crowned the cone
of vesuvius

  gradually the path grew steeper and
more difficult the firm road gave place
to a mere track over masses of loose ashes
and blocks of lava which had once poured
in a fiery torrent from the crater above
the air began to be tainted with the
acrid fumes of sulfur thin streams of
murky vapor began to sprout from the fis-
sures in the crust of cooled lava on which
he trod the very fabric of the moun-
tain trembled like a giant in the throes of


weird tales

mortal agony the heat became greater
with every step he took

  but still he struggled upward now
making a detour to avoid some belching
pit now sinking knee-deep in fine black
ashes panting sweating in every pore
he gained the summit and threw himself
flat on the ground to regain his breath

  when he raised his head and looked
about him he saw that he was standing
on the brink of a vast pit the further-
most lip of which was hidden by the
rolling clouds of smoke which poured
from it far below a lake of white-hot
lava heaved and eddied-a restless sea
whose billows were tongues of fire and
its spray the deadly fumes of blazing sul-
fur unearthly bellowings nerve-rack-
ing crashes assailed his ears at intervals
and mingling with them was a bubbling
roar like the boiling of a gigantic caul-
dron

  as he stood faint and trembling he
became aware of a darker patch amid the
whirling smoke slowly it took shape
before his eyes advancing toward him
the while and forcing him to cringe back
step by step to the verge of the fiery pit

  hold he screamed with a courage
bom of despair the race was not run
fairly-i was beaten by a trick corenzio
drugged my wine-otherwise he himself
would have been the last to pass through
the door

  a sound of mocking laughter issued
from the cloud

  were you not warned beforehand
that you must meet guile with guile
said a hollow voice what would you
have me-the father of all knavery-dis-
countenance the very tenets i advocate
then indeed should i be a house divided
against myself

  vitelli found himself forced bade an-
other step frenziedly he raised his voice
above the roaring of the flames

  then as you love trickery so much
you can not hold me to my bond he
cried recklessly

  the advancing cloud paused

what mean ye asked the voice
all that the compaa gives you is the
last thing that passed through the door
and thy body taso vitelli was that
last thing said the voice and that i
am about to claim for my own

  nay vitelli returned with a tri-
umphant laugh after my body came
my shadoiv my shadow is die only tiling
to which you can lay claim-and that you
are welcome to take it-and let me go
a mighty burst of laughter mingled
with the subterranean thunders of the
volcano it seemed as though the devil
were not ill pleased with the artful quib-
ble by which his disciple sought to evade
his debt

  so be it he announced at length
we will keep to the stria letter of the
bond from now onward thy shadow be-
longs to me but-the voice dropped
to a menacing hiss as it continued-full
well thou knowest that till now no trick-
ster has outwitted the arch-trickster of
all-myself thou shalt go forth into
the world-a man without a shadow but
for thine own safety take heed that you
confine your steps to the shady side of
the street or better still stir not out of
doors until the sun hath set for the holy
inquisition is well served by its spies in
naples and already they have cast a sus-
picious eye in your direaion all that
however must be your affair for my
part thou art free

  the cloud rolled back and taso vi-
telli staggered away from the crater

  i thank thee sathanus he cried
farewell

   arrivederci came the answer with
grim significance

                 w t-
the avenging shadow



jov lent wings to vitellis feet as he
hurried from die accursed spot he
laughed aloud and sang in his delirious
excitement had he not gained a new
lease of life had he not outwitted the
arch-fiend himself

   the sight of the first houses of resina
caused him to moderate his transports
however and silently as a ghost he stole
through the deserted street the moon
peered out through a rift in the veil of
clouds as he neared the gates of naples
but when he glanced behind him he saw
that no familiar black outline showed on
the white dust of the road his shadow
was already in the devils keeping

  what of it he laughed aloud as he
snapped his fingers in the air what is
a shadow nothing-less than nothing
corpo di baccof i wish the fiend joy of
his bargain

   nevertheless he waited until the moon
was hidden before accosting the halber-
dier who guarded the city gate

  buona sera amico he said slipping
a coin into the fellows palm surely
you will not refuse entry to a man who
has tarried over-long with one of the fair
damsels of resina

   the sentinel started at the sound of his
voice

  stand ho he cried suddenly lower-
ing the point of his weapon until it was
level with the others breast then he

   raised his voice still louder guard ho
guard here is the very man we have
been searching for

  there was a rush of many feet and
clashing of hastily caught-up weapons
armed men emerged from the guard
chamber and an instant later vitelli
found himself surrounded by a ring of
steel amazement at this unexpected re-
ception gave place to dread as the officer
of the watch stepped forward and
touched him on the shoulder with his
staff of office

  taso vitelli i arrest thee for break-
ing into the house of gian beccliino the
banker and murdering him

  vitelli staggered back with sagging
jaw and staring eyes

  i he gasped i murder becchino
art thou drunk or moon-struck why

i	have not set foot within the city walls
since nightfall

  the officer shrugged contemptuously
you had better invent a more plausi-
ble tale than that when you appear before
the judge he said grimly know
then that neinissa was returning to the
house when she heard her fathers cries
for help finding the front door locked
she roused the neighborhood and a crowd
gathered a hundred people are prepared
to swear that they saw your shadow on
the window blind at die very moment

 passing of a god

by henry s whitehead

ran uncanny story of surgery and the dark rites of the black people in the land
of haiti

sv ttou say that when carswell came
j into your hospital over in port au
prince his fingers looked as
though they had been wound with
string said i encouragingly

  it is a very ugly story that canevin
replied doaor pelletier still reluaant it
appeared

  you promised to tell me i threw in
i know it canevin admitted doaor
pelletier of the u s navy medical
corps now stationed here in the virgin
islands but he proceeded you
couldnt use this story anyhow there
are editorial tabus arent there the
thing is too-what shall i say-too out-
rageous too incredible

  yes i admitted in turn there are
tabus plenty of them still after hearing
about those fingers as though wound
with string-why not give me the story
pelletier leave it to me whether or not i
use it its the story i want mostly im
burning up for it

  i suppose its your lookout said my
guest if you find it too gruesome for
you tell me and ill quit

  i	plucked up hope once more i had
been trying for this story after getting
little scraps of it which allured and in-
trigued me for weeks

  start in i ventured soothingly
pushing the silver swizzel-jug after the
humidor of cigarettes from which pel-
letier was even now making a seleaion
pelletier helped himself to the swizzel
frowningly evidently he was torn
between the desire to pour out the story
of arthur carswell and some complica-

   copyright  by henry s whitehead

    

tion of feelings against doing so i sat
back in my wicker lounge-chair and
waited

  pelletier moved his large bulk about in
his chair plainly now he was cogitating
how to open the tale he began medi-
tatively

  i dont know as i ever heard public
discussion of the malignant bodily
growths except among medical people
science knows little about them the faa
of such diseases though is well known
to everybody through campaigns of pre-
vention the life insurance companies ap-
peals for funds-

  well carswells case primarily is
one of those cases

  he paused and gazed into the glowing
end of his cigarette

   primarily  i threw in encour-
agingly

  yes speaking as a surgeon thats
where this thing begins i suppose

   i	kept still waiting

  have you read seabrooks book the
magic island canevin asked pelletier
suddenly

  yes i answered what about it

  then i suppose that from your own
experience knocking around the west
indies and your study of it all a good bit
of that stuff of seabrooks is familiar to
you isnt it-the vodu and the hill cus-
toms and all the rest of it especially over
in haiti-you could check up on a writer
like seabrook couldnt you more or
less

  yes said i praaically all of it was
an old story to me-a very fine piece of
work however the thing clicks all the
passing of a god



they knell down all around him on the floor of
his living-room

way through-an honest and thorough
piece of investigation

  anything in it new to you

  yes-seabrooks statement that there
was an exchange of personalities between
the sacrificial goat-at the baptism-and
the young black girl the chapter he calls
gtrl-cry-goat-cry that at least was
a new one on me i admit

   you will recall if you read it care-
fully that he attributed that phenomenon
to his own personal slant on the thing
isnt that the case canevin

  yes i agreed i think that is the
way he put it

  then resumed doaor pelletier i
take it that all that material of his-i
notice that there have been a lot of story-
writers using his terms lately-is suffi-
ciently familiar to you so that you have
some clear idea of the haitian-african
demigods like ogoun badagris dam-
balla and the others taking up their resi-

dence for a short time in some devotee

  the idea is very well understood
said i mr seabrook mentions it among
a number of other local phenomena it
was an old negro who came up to him
while he was eating thrust his soiled
hands into the dishes of food surprized
him considerably-then was surrounded
by worshippers who took him to the near-
est houmfort or w-house let him sit on
the altar brought him food hung all
their jewelry on him worshipped him for
the time being then charaaeristically
quite utterly ignored the original old fel-
low after the possession on the part of
the deity ceased and reduced him to an
unimportant old pantaloon as he was
before

  that summarizes it exaaly agreed
doaor pelletier that canevin that
kind of thing i mean is the real starting-
place of this dreadful matter of arthur
carswell

  you mean- i barged out at


weird tales

pelletier vastly intrigued i had had no
idea that there was vodu mixed in with
the case

  i mean that arthur carswells first
intimation that there was anything press-
ingly wrong with him was just such a
possession as the one you have re-
counted

  but-but i protested i had sup-
posed-i had every reason to believe
that it was a surgical matter why you
just objected to telling about it on the
ground that-

  precisely said doctor pelletier
calmly it was such a surgical case but
as i say it began in much the same way
as the occupation of that old - negros
body by ogoun badagris or whichever
one of their devilish deities that hap-
pened to be just as you say is well
known to fellows like yourself who go in
for such things and just as seabrook re-
corded it

  well said i you go ahead in your
own way pelletier ill do my best to
listen do you mind an occasional ques-
tion

  not in the least said doctor pel-
letier considerately shifted himself to a
still more pronouncedly recumbent posi-
tion in my chinese rattan lounge-chair lit
a fresh cigarette and proceeded

     arswell had worked up a consid-
erable intimacy with the snake-
worship of interior haiti all the sort of
thing familiar to you the sort of thing
set out probably for the first time in
english at least in seabrooks book all
the gatherings and the baptism and the
sacrifices of the fowls and the bull and
the goats the orgies of the worshippers
the boom and thrill of the rata drums-
all that strange incomprehensible rather
silly-surfaced deadly-underneathed wor-
shio of the snake which the dahomey-

ans brought with them to old hispaniola
now haiti and the dominican republic

  he had been there as you may have
heard for a number of years went there
in the first place because everybody
thought he was a kind of failure at home
made a good living too in a way nobody
but an original-minded fellow like him
would have thought of-shot ducks on
the leogane marshes dried them and
exported them to new york and san
francisco to the united states two largest
chinatowns

  for a failure too carswell was a
particularly smart-looking chap smart i
mean in the english sense of that word
he was one of those fellows who was
always shaved clean freshly groomed
even under the rather adverse conditions
of his living there in leogane by the salt
marshes and of his trade which was to
kill and dry ducks a fellow can get
pretty careless and la himself go at that
sort of thing away from home away
too from such niceties as there are in a
place like port au prince

  he looked in fact like a fellow just
off somebodys yacht the first time i saw
him there in the hospital in port au
prince and that too was right after a
rather singular experience which would
have unnerved or unsettled pretty nearly
anybody

  but not so old carswell no indeed
i speak of him as old carswell canev-
in that though is a kind of affection-
ate term he was somewhere about forty-
five then it was two years ago you see
and in addition to his being very spick
and span well groomed you know he
looked surprizingly young somehow
one of those faces which showed experi
ence but along with the experience a
philosophy the lines in his face were
good lines if you get what i mean-lines
of humor and courage no dissipation no
passing of a god



let-down kind of lines nothing of slack-
ness such as you would see in the face of
even a comparatively young beach-comb-
er no as he strode into my office almost
jauntily there in the hospital there was
nothing nothing whatever about him to
suggest anything else but a prosperous
fellow american a professional chap for
choice who might as i say have just
come ashore from somebodys yacht

  and yet-good god canevin the
story that came out-

  naval surgeon though he was with
service in haiti at sea in nicaragua and
the china station to his credit doaor
pelletier rose at this point and almost
agitatedly walked up and down my gal-
lery then he sat down and lit a fresh
cigarette

   there is he said refleaively and as
though weighing his words carefully
there is canevin among various others
a somewhat wild theory that somebody
put forward several years ago about the
origin of malignant tumors it never
gained very much approval among the
medical profession but it has at least
the merit of originality and-it was new
because of those faas it had a certain
amount of currency and there are those
in and out of medicine who still believe
in it it is that there are certain nuclei
certain masses so to speak of the bodily
material which have persisted-not gen-
erally you understand but in certain
cases-among certain persons the kind
who are susceptible to this horrible dis-
ease which in the pre-natal state did not
develop fully or normally-little places
in the bodily structure that is-if i make
myself clear-which remain unde-
veloped

   something according to this hypothe-
sis something like a sudden jar or a
bruise a kick a blow with the fist the
result of a fall or whatnot causes trau-

matism-physical injury that is you
know-to one of the focus-places and
the undeveloped little mass of material
starts in to grow and so displaces the
normal tissue which surrounds it

  one objeaion to the theory is that
there are at least two varieties well-
known and recognized scientifically the
carcinoma which is itself subdivided into
two kinds the hard and the soft carci-
nomae and the sarcoma which is a soft
thing like what is popularly understood
by a tumor of course they are all
tumors particular kinds of tumors ma-
lignant tumors what lends a certain
credibility to the theory i have just men-
tioned is the malignancy the growing el-
ement for whatever the underlying rea-
son they grow canevin as is well recog-
nized and this explanation i have been
talking about gives a reason for the
growth the malignancy is really that
one of the things seems to have as it
were its own life all this probably you
know

   i nodded i did not wish to interrupt
i could see that this side-issue on a
scientific by-path must have something to
do with the story of carswell

   now resumed pelletier notice this
faa canevin let me put it in the form
of a question like this to what kind or
type of vodu worshipper does the pos-
session by one of their deities occur-
from your own knowledge of such things
what would you say

  to the incomplete the abnormal to
an old man or woman said i slowly
refleaing or-to a child or perhaps to
an idiot idiots ancient crones backward
children town-fools and the like all
over europe are supposed to be in some
mysterious way en rapport with deity-or
with satan it is an established peasant
belief even among the mahometans the
moron or idiot is the affiiaed of god


weird tales

there is no other better established belief
along such lines of thought

  precisely exclaimed pelletier and
canevin go back once more to seabrooks
instance that we spoke about what type
of person was possessed

  an old doddering man said i one
well gone in his dotage apparently
right once more note now two
things first i will admit to you canev-
in that that theory i have just been ex-
pounding never made much of a hit
with me it might be true but-very few
first-rate men in our profession thought
much of it and i followed that negative
lead and didnt think much of it or in-
deed much about it i put it down to
the vaporings of the theorist who first
thought it out and published it and let it
go at that now canevin i am con-
vinced that it is true the second thing
then when carswell came into my office
in the hospital over there in port au
prince the first thing i noticed about him
-i had never seen him before you see-
was a peculiar almost an indescribable
discrepancy it was between his general
appearance of weather-worn cleanliness
general fitness his smart appearance in
his clothes-all that which fitted together
about the clean-cut open character of the
fellow and what i can only describe as a
pursiness he seemed in good condition
i mean to say and yet-there was some-
thing somehow flabby somewhere in his
makeup i couldnt put my finger on it
but-it was there a suggestion of some-
thing that detracted from the impression
he gave as being an upstanding fellow a
good-fellow-to-have-beside-you-in-a-pinch
-that kind of person

the second thing i noticed it was
a just after he had taken a chair
beside my desk was his fingers and
thumbs they were swollen canevin

looked sore as though they had been
wound with string that was the first
thing i thought of being wound with
string he saw me looking at them held
them out to me abruptly laid them side
by side his hands i mean on my desk
and smiled at me

   i see you have noticed them doc-
tor he remarked almost jovially that
makes it a little easier for me to tell you
what im here for its-well you might
put it down as a symptom

  i looked at his fingers and thumbs
every one of them was affected in the
same way and ended up with putting a
magnifying glass over them

  they were all bruised and reddened
and here and there on several of them
the skin was abraded broken circularly
-it was a most curious-looking set of
digits my new patient was addressing
me again

   im not here to ask you riddles
doaor he said gravely this time but
-would you care to make a guess at
what did that to those fingers and thumbs
of mine

   well i came back at him without
knowing whats happened it looks as if
youd been trying to wear about a hun-
dred rings all at one time and most of
them didnt fit

  carswell nodded his head at me
score one for the medico said he and
laughed even numerically youre almost
on the dot sir the precise number was
one hundred and six

  i confess i stared at him then but
he wasnt fooling it was a cold sober
serious faa that he was stating only he
saw that it had a humorous side and
that intrigued him as anything humorous
always did i found out after i got to
know carswell a lot better than i did
then
passing of a god



  you said you wouldnt mind a few
questions pelletier i interjected

  fire away said pelletier do you
see any light so far

  i was naturally figuring along with
you as you told about it all said i do
i infer correctly that carswell having
lived there-how long four or five years

or so-

  seven to be exact put in pelletier

  --that carswell being pretty famil-
iar with the native doings had mixed into
things got the confidence of his black
neighbors in and around leogane become
somewhat adept had the run of the
houmjorts so to speak-votre bougie
msieu-the fortune-telling at the festi-
vals and so forth and-had been vis-
ited by one of the black deities that
apparently if im any judge of tenden-
cies is what your account seems to be
leading up to those bruised fingers-
the one hundred and six rings-good
heavens man is it really possible
carswell told me all about that end
of it a little later-yes that was pre-
cisely what happened but-that sur-
prizing incredible as it seems is only the

small end of it all you just wait-

  go ahead said i i am all ears i
assure you

  well carswell took his hands off the
desk after i had looked at them through
my magnifying glass and then waved
one of them at me in a kind of depre-
cating gesture

    ill go into all that if youre inter-
ested to hear about it doctor he as-
sured me but that isnt what im here
about his face grew suddenly very
grave have you plenty of time he
asked i dont want to la my case inter-
fere with anything

   fire ahead says i and he leaned
forward in his chair

   doaor says he i dont know

whether or not you ever heard of me
before my names carswell and i live
over leogane way im an american like
yourself as you can probably see and
even after seven years of it out there
duck-hunting mostly with virtually no
white-mans doings for a pretty long
time i havent gone native or anything
of the sort i wouldnt want you to think
im one of those wasters he looked up
at me inquiringly for my estimate of him
he had been by himself a good deal per-
haps too much i nodded at him he
looked me in the eye squarely and
nodded back i guess we understand
each other he said then he went on

   seven years ago it was i came down
here ive lived over there ever since
what few people know about me regard
me as a kind of failure i daresay but-
doctor there was a reason for that a
pretty definite reason i wont go into it
beyond your end of it-the medical end
i mean i came down because of this

  he stood up then and i saw what
made that discrepancy i spoke about
that flabbiness which went so ill with
the general cut of the man he turned
up the lower ends of his white drill jacka
and put his hand a little to the left of
the middle of his stomach just notice
this he said and stepped toward me

   there just over the left center of that
area and extending up toward the spleen
on the left side you know there was a
protuberance seen closely it was appar-
ent that here was some sort of internal
growth it was that which had made him
look flabby stomachish

   this was diagnosed for me in new
york carswell explained a little more
than seven years ago they told me it
was inoperable then after seven years
probably i daresay its worse if anything
to put the thing in a nutshell doaor i
had to let go dien i got out of a


weird tales

promising business broke off my engage-
ment came here i wont expatiate on it
all but-it was pretty tough doctor
pretty tough ive lasted all right so far
it hasnt troubled me-until just lately
thats why i drove in this afternoon to
see you to see if anything could be done

   has it been kicking up lately i
asked him

   yes said carswell simply they
said it would kill me probably within a
year or so as it grew it hasnt grown-
much ive lasted a little more than seven
years so far

   come in to the operating-room i
invited him and take your clothes off
and lets get a good look at it

   anything you say returned cars-
well and followed me back into the
operating-room then and there

  i had a good look at carswell first
superficially that preliminary examina-
tion revealed a growth quite typical the
self-contained not the fibrous type in
the location ive already described and
about the size of an average mans head
it lay imbedded fairly deep it was what
we call encapsulated that of course is
what had kept carswell alive

  then we put the x-rays on it fore-
and-aft and sidewise one of those
things doesnt always respond very well
to skiagraphic examination to the x-ray
that is but this one showed clearly
enough inside it appeared a kind of
dark triangular mass with the small end
at the top when doaor smithson and
i had looked him over thoroughly i
asked carswell whether or not he wanted
to stay with us to come into the hospital
as a patient for treatment

   im quite in your hands doaor he
told me ill stay or do whatever you
want me to but first and for the first
time he looked a trifle embarrassed i
think id better tell you the story that

goes with my coming here however
speaking plainly do you think i have a
chance

    well said i speaking plainly yes
there is a chance maybe a fifty-fifty
chance maybe a little less on the one
hand this thing has been let alone for
seven years since original diagnosis its
probably less operable than it was when
you were in new york on the other
hand we know a lot more not about
these things mr carswell but about
surgical technique than they did seven
years ago on the whole id advise you
to stay and get ready for an operation
and say about forty-sixty youll go
bade to leogane or back to new york
if you feel like it several pounds lighter
in weight and a new man if it takes you
on the table well youve had a lot more
time out there gunning for ducks in
leogane than those new york fellows
allowed you

   im with you said carswell and we
assigned him a room took his history
and began to get him ready for his
operation

tie did the operation two days

    later at ten-thirty in the morn-
ing and in the meantime carswell told
me his story about it

  it seems that he had made quite a
place for himself there in leogane
among the negroes and the ducks in
seven years a man like carswell with his
mental and dispositional equipment can
go quite a long way anywhere he had
managed to make quite a good thing out
of his duck-drying industry employed
five or six hands in his little wooden
faaory rebuilt a rather good house he
had secured there for a song right after
he had arrived colleaed local antiques
to add to the equipment he had brought
along with him made himself a real
passing of a god



home of a peculiar bachelor kind and
above all got in solid with the black
people all around him almost inci-
dentally i gathered from him-he had no
gift of narrative and i had to question
him a great deal-he had got onto and
into die know in the vodu thing there
wasnt as far as i could get it any aspect
of it ail that he hadnt been in on ex-
cept that is la chevre sans comes-the
goat without horns you know-the
human sacrifice on great occasions in
fact he strenuously denied that die vodu-
ists resorted to that said it was a canard
against them that they never really did
such things never had unless back in
prehistoric times in guinea-africa 

   but there wasnt anything about it
all that he hadnt at his very finger-ends
and at first-hand too the man was a
walking encyclopedia of the native beliefs
customs and practises he knew too
every turn and twist of their speech he
hadnt as he had said at first gone na-
tive in the slightest degree and yet
without lowering his white mans dignity
by a trifle he had got it all

   that brings us to the specific happen-
ing the story which he had said went
along with his reason for coming in to
the hospital in port au prince to us

   it appears that his sarcoma had never
practically troubled beyond noting a
very gradual increase in its size from year
to year he said he wouldnt know he
had one in other words characteristical-
ly it never gave him any pain or direct
annoyance beyond the sense of the
wretched thing being there and increas-
ing on him and always drawing him
closer to that end of life which the new
york doctors had warned him about

  then it had happened only three
days before he came to the hospital he
had gone suddenly unconscious one after-
noon as he was walking down his shell
jpath to his gateway the last thing he

remembered then was being about four
steps from the gate when he woke up
it was dark he was seated in a big chair
on his own front gallery and the first
thing he noticed was that his fingers and
thumbs were sore and ached very pain-
fully the next thing was that there were
flares burning all along the edge of the
gallery and down in the front yard and
along die road outside the paling fence
that divided his property from the road
and in the light of these flares there
swarmed literally hundreds of negroes
gathered about him and mostly on their
knees lined along the gallery and on
the grounds below it prostrating them-
selves chanting putting earth and sand
on their heads and when he leaned back
in his chair something hurt the back of
his neck and he found that he was being
nearly choked with the necklaces strings
of beads gold and silver coin-strings and
other kinds that had been draped over
his head his fingers and the thumbs as
well were covered with gold and silver
rings many of them jammed on so as to
stop the circulation

  from his knowledge of their beliefs
he recognized what had happened to him
he had he figured probably fainted
although such a thing was not at all com-
mon with him going down the pathway
to the yard gate and the blacks had sup-
posed him to be possessed as he had sev-
eral times seen black people children old
men and women morons chiefly similar-
ly possessed he knew that now that he
was recovered from whatever had hap-
pened to him the worship ought to
cease and if he simply sat quiet and took
what was coming to him they would as
soon as they realized he was himself
once more leave him alone and he would
get some relief from this uncomfortable
set of surroundings get rid of the neck-
laces and the rings get a little privacy


weird tales

  but-the queer part of it all was that
they didnt quit no the mob around
the house and on the gallery increased
rather than diminished and at last he was
put to it from sheer discomfort-he said
he came to the point where he felt he
couldnt stand it all another instant-to
speak up and ask the people to leave him
in peace

  they left him he says at that right
off the bat immediately without a pro-
testing voice but-and here was what
started him on his major puzzlement-
they didnt take off the necklaces and
rings no-they left the whole set of
that metallic drapery which they had hung
and thrust upon him right there and
after he had been left alone as he had re-
quested and had gone into his house and
lifted off the necklaces and worked the
rings loose the next thing that happened
was that old pap josef the local papaloi
together with three or four other neigh-
boring papalois witch-doctors from near-
by villages and followed by a very old
man who was known to carswell as the
hougan or head witch-doctor of the
whole countryside thereabouts came in
to him in a kind of procession and knelt
down all around him on the floor of his
living-room and laid down gourds of
cream and bottles of red rum and cooked
chickens and even a big china bowl of
tannia soup-a dish he abominated said
it always tasted like soapy water to him
-and then backed out leaving him to
these comestibles

   he said that this sort of attention per-
sisted in his case right through the three
days that he remained in his house in
leogane before he started out for the
hospital would apparently be still going
on if he hadnt come in to port au prince
to us

  but-his coming in was not in the
least because of this it had puzzled him

a great deal for there was nothing like
it in his experience nor so far as he
could gather from their attitude in the
experience of the people about him of
the papalois or even of the hougan him-
self they acted in other words pre-
cisely as though the deity supposed to
have taken up his abode within him had
remained there although there seemed
no precedent for such an occurrence and
so far as he knew he felt precisely just
as he had felt right along that is fully
awake and certainly not in anything
like an abnormal condition and very
positively not in anything like a fainting-
fit

  that is to say-he felt precisely the
same as usual except that-he attributed
it to the probability that he must have
fallen on the ground that time when he
lost consciousness going down the path-
way to the gate he had been told that
passers-by had picked him up and carried
him to the gallery where he had
awakened later these good samaritans
meanwhile recognizing that one of the
deities had indwelt him-he felt the
same except for recurrent almost unbear-
able pains in the vicinity of his lower
abdominal region

  there was nothing surprizing to him
in this accession of the new painfulness
he had been warned that that would be
the beginning of the end it was in the
rather faint hope that something might be
done that he had come in to the hospital
it speaks volumes for the mans forti-
tude for his strength of character that
he came in so cheerfully acquiesced in
what we suggested to him to do re-
mained with us facing those comparative-
ly slim chances with complete cheerful-
ness

  for-we did not deceive carswell-
the chances were somewhat slim sixty-
forty i had said but as i afterward made
clear to him the favorable chances as
passing of a god



gleaned from the mortality tables were
a good deal less than that

  he went to the table in a state of
mind quite unchanged from his accus-
tomed cheerfulness he shook hands
good-bye with doaor smithson and me
in case and also with doaor jackson
who acted as anesthetist

     arswell took an enormous amount
vj of ether to get him off his con-
sciousness persisted longer perhaps than
that of any surgical patient i can remem-
ber at last however doaor jackson
intimated to me that i might begin and
doaor smithson standing by with the
retraaing forceps i made the first in-
cision it was my intention after careful
study of the x-ray plates to open it up
from in front in an up-and-down direc-
tion establish drainage direaly and leav-
ing the wound in the sound tissue in
front of it open to attempt to get it
healed up after removing its contents
such is the technique of the major por-
tion of successful operations

  it was a comparatively simple matter
to expose the outer wall this accom-
plished and after a few words of con-
sultation with my colleague i very care-
fully opened it we recalled that the
x-ray had shown as i mentioned a tri-
angular-shaped mass within this appar-
ent content we attributed to some obscure
chemical coloration of the contents i
made my incisions with the greatest care
and delicacy of course the critical part
of the operation lay right at this point
and the greatest exaaitude was indicated
of course

  at last the outer coats of it were cut
through and retraaed and with renewed
caution i made the incision through the
inmost wall of tissue to my surprize
and to doaor smithsons the inside was
comparatively dry the gauze which the
nurse attending had caused to follow the

path of the knife was hardly moistened
i ran my knife down below the original
scope of that last incision then upward
from its upper extremity greatly length-
ening the incision as a whole if you are
following me

  then reaching my gloved hand with-
in this long up-and-down aperture i felt
about and at once discovered that i could
get my fingers in around the inner con-
taining wall quite easily i reached and
worked my fingers in farther and farther
finally getting both hands inside and at
last feeling my fingers touch inside the
posterior or rear wall rapidly now i
ran the edges of my hands around in-
side and quite easily lifted out the in-
side this a mass weighing several
pounds of more or less solid material
was laid aside on the small table beside
the operating-table and again pausing
to consult with doaor smithson-the
operation was going you see a lot better
than either of us had dared to anticipate
-and being encouraged by him to pro-
ceed to a radical step which we had not
hoped to be able to take i began the
disseaion from the surrounding normal
tissue of the now collapsed walls this
a long difficult and harassing job was
accomplished at the end of perhaps ten
or twelve minutes of gruelling work and
the bag-like thing now completely sev-
ered from the tissues in which it had
been for so long imbedded was placed
also on the side table

  doaor jackson reporting favorably on
our patients condition under the anesthet-
ic i now proceeded to dress the large
aperture and to close the body-wound
this was accomplished in a routine man-
ner and then together we bandaged
carswell and he was taken back to his
room to await awakening from the ether

  carswell disposed of doaor jackson
and doaor smithson left the operating-
room and the nurse started in cleaning


weird tales

up after the operation dropping the in-
struments into the boiler and so on-a
routine set of duties as for me i picked
up the shell in a pair of forceps turned
it about under the strong electric oper-
ating-light and laid it down again it
presented nothing of interest for a pos-
sible laboratory examination

  then i picked up the more or less
solid contents which i had laid very
hastily and without looking at it-you
see my actual removal of it had been
done inside in the dark for the most part
and by the sense of feeling with my
hands you will remember-i picked it
up i still had my operating-gloves on to
prevent inf ection when looking over these
specimens and still not looking at it
particularly carried it out into the lab-
oratory

  canevin-doaor pelletier looked at
me somberly through the very gradually
fading light of late afternoon the period
just before the abrupt falling of our
tropic dusk-canevin he repeated
honestly i dont know how to tell you
listen now old man do something for
me will you

  why yes-of course said i con-
siderably mystified what is it you want
me to do pelletier

   my car is out in front of the house
come on home with me up to my house
will you lets say i want to give you a
cocktail anyhow maybe youll under-
stand better when you are there i want
to tell you the rest up at my house not
here will you please come canevin

   i looked at him closely this seemed
to me a very strange an abrupt request
still there was nothing whatever unrea-
sonable about such a sudden whim on
pelletiers part

   why yes certainly ill go with you
pelletier if you want me to

   come on then said pelletier and
we started for his car

  the doaor drove himself and after
we had taken the first turn in the rather
complicated route from my house to his
on the extreme airy top of denmark hill
he said in a quiet voice

  put together now canevin certain
points if you please in this story note
kindly how the black people over in
leogane aaed according to carswells
story note too that theory i was telling
you about do you recollea it clearly
yes said i still more mystified
just keep those two points in mind
then added doaor pelletier and de-
voted himself to navigating sharp turns
and plodding up two steep roadways for
the rest of the drive to his house

we went in and found his house-
boy laying the table for his dinner
doaor pelletier is unmarried keeps a
hospitable bachelor establishment he
ordered cocktails and the houseboy de-
parted on this errand then he led me
into a kind of office littered with medical
and surgical paraphernalia he lifted
some papers off a chair motioned me into
it and took another near by listen
now he said and held up a finger at me

  i took that thing as i mentioned into
the laboratory said he i carried it in
my hand with my gloves still on as
aforesaid i laid it down on a table and
turned on a powerful light over it it
was only then that i took a good look at
it it weighed several pounds at least
was about the bulk and heft of a full-
grown coconut and about the same color
as a hulled coconut that is a kind of
medium brown as i looked at it i saw
that it was as the x-ray had indicated
vaguely triangular in shape it lay over
on one of its sides under that powerful
light and-canevin so help me god-
doaor pelletier leaned toward me his
face working a great seriousness in his
eyes-it moved canevin he mur-
passing of a god



mured and as i looked-the thing
breathed i was just plain dumfounded
a biological specimen like that-does not
move canevin i shook all over sud-
denly i felt my hair prickle on the roots
of my scalp i felt chills go down my
spine then i remembered that here i
was after an operation in my own bio-
logical laboratory i came close to the
thing and propped it up on what might
be called its logical base if you see what
i mean so that it stood as nearly upright
as its triangular conformation permitted

  and then i saw that it had faint yel-
lowish markings over the brown and that
what you might call its skin was moving
and-as i stared at the thing canevin-
two things like little arms began to move
and the top of it gave a kind of con-
vulsive shudder and it opened straight at
me canevin a pair of eyes and looked
me in the face

  those eyes-my god canevin those
eyes they were eyes of something more
than human canevin something incred-
ibly evil something vastly old sophisti-
cated cold immune from anything ex-
cept pure evil the eyes of something that
had been worshipped canevin from ages
and ages out of a past that went back
before all known human calculation eyes
that showed all the deliberate lurking
wickedness that has ever been in the
world the eyes closed canevin and the
thing sank over onto its side and heaved
and shuddered convulsively

  it was sick canevin and now em-
boldened holding myself together re-
peating over and over to myself that i
had a case of the quavers of post-opera-
tive nerves i forced myself to look
closer and as i did so i got from it a
faint whiff of ether two tiny ape-like
nostrils over a damped-shut slit of a
mouth were exhaling and inhaling
drawing in the good pure air exhaling
ether fumes it popped into my head that

carswell had consumed a terrific amount
of ether before he went under we had
commented on that doaor jackson par-
ticularly i put two and two together
canevin remembered we were in haiti
where things are not like new york or
boston or baltimore those negroes had
believed that the deity had not come out
of carswell do you see that was the
thing that held the edge of my mind
the thing stirred uneasily put out one of
its arms groped about stiffened

  i reached for a near-by specimen-jar
canevin reasoning almost blindly that
if this thing were susceptible to ether it
would be susceptible to-well my gloves
were still on my hands and-now shud-
dering so that i could hardly move at all
i had to force every motion-i reached
out and took hold of the thing-it felt
like moist leather-and dropped it into
the jar then i carried the carboy of
preserving alcohol over to the table and
poured it in till the ghastly thing was en-
tirely covered the alcohol near the top of
the jar it writhed once then rolled over
on its back and lay still the mouth now
open do you believe me canevin

  i have always said that i would be-
lieve anything on proper evidence said
i slowly and i would be the last to
question a statement of yours pelletier
however although i have as you say
looked into some of these things perhaps
more than most it seems well-

  doctor pelletier said nothing then he
slowly got up out of his chair he stepped
over to a wall-cupboard and returned a
wide-mouthed specimen-jar in his hand
he laid the jar down before me in si-
lence

  i looked into it through the slightly
discolored alcohol with which the jar
tightly sealed with rubber-tape and seal-
ing-wax was filled nearly to the brim
there on the jars bottom lay such a
thing as pelletier had described a thing


weird tales

which if it had been seated upright
would somewhat have resembled that
representation of the happy little godling
billiken which was popular twenty years
ago as a desk ornament a thing suggest-
ing the sinister the unearthly even in
this dessicated form i looked long at the
thing

  excuse me for even seeming to hesi-
tate pelletier said i reflectively

  i cant say that i blame you returned
the genial doaor it is by the way the
first and only time i have ever tried to
tell the story to anybody

  and carswell i asked ive been
intrigued with that good fellow and his
difficulties how did he come out of it
all

  he made a magnificent recovery from
the operation said pelletier and after-
ward when he went back to leogane he
told me that the negroes while glad to
see him quite as usual had quite lost
interest in him as the throne of a divin-
ity

  hm i remarked it would seem
that to bear out-

  yes said pelletier i have always
regarded that faa as absolutely con-
clusive indeed how otherwise could one
possibly account for-this he indicated
the contents of the laboratory jar

  i nodded my head in agreement with
him i can only say that-if you wont
feel insulted pelletier-that you are sin-
gularly open-minded for a man of sci-
ence what by the way became of
carswell

  the houseboy came in with a tray and
pelletier and i drank to each others good
health

  he came in to port au prince re-

plied pelletier after he had done the
honors he did not want to go back to
the states he said the lady to whom
he had been engaged had died a couple
of years before he felt that he would be
out of touch with american business the
faa is-he had stayed out here too long
too continuously but he remains an
authority on haitian native affairs and
is consulted by the high commissioner
he knows literally more about haiti
than the haitians themselves i wish you
might meet him youd have a lot in
common

  ill hope to do that said i and rose
to leave the houseboy appeared at the
door smiling in my direaion

  the table is set for two sar said he
doaor pelletier led the way into the
dining-room taking it for granted that i
would remain and dine with him we
are informal in st thomas about such
matters i telephoned home and sat down
with him

  pelletier suddenly laughed-he was
half-way through his soup at the moment
i looked up inquiringly he put down his
soup spoon and looked across the table
at me

  its a bit odd he remarked when
you stop to think of it theres one
thing carswell doesnt know about haiti
and what happens there

  whats that i inquired

  that-thing-in there said pelle-
tier indicating the office with his thumb
in the way artists and surgeons do i
thought hed had troubles enough without
that on his mind too

  i nodded in agreement and resumed
my soup pelletier has a cook in a thou-
sand

	the leather cannon

it was noon of a pleasant october
day in the year of our lord 
the sun in its course over north-
western germany laid warm beams im-
partially upon warring catholic and
lutheran alike many years of war
had made their marks in deep impres-
sions upon the countryside and upon the
countyfolk as well children had been
bom while war raged and grown up
knowing no other sort of existence the
maiden to lead a life of shame in the
train of one of the numerous armies the
strong man to become a pillager and rob
others as his own heritage had been
snatched from him life had grown
crude and hard

  the sun passed on illuminating
charred towers forsaken cities plundered
cathedrals fields long fallen knew the
healing glow and little green things
sprouting between the cobblestones of
deserted villages rejoiced that the crush-
ing foot of man no longer troubled them

  the noxious weed of intolerance
which had sprouted on st bartholomews
eve had flowered and cast its blight over
all europe and its far-flung roots were
thrust deep in german soil

  directly over a small sandy hill the
sunbeams streamed down into an excava-
tion which had converted the elevation
into a rude fortalice

  the pit was roughly twenty feet deep
by thirty in length crude ladders led

 the master has a narrow escape


weird tales

here and there from the bottom of the
pit to a firing-platform which ran around
the sides of the hole about five feet low-
er than the rim in places the loose sand
and turf had caved down forming
mounds of earth upon the platform but
even so a man might yet crouch low and
be unobserved by any one for the hill
was the highest point in the immediately
surrounding country

  at two sides lay crescent-like a thick
beech wood and on the other perhaps a
mile distant the ruins of a village flamed
and crackled a cloud of smoke drifted
idly toward the hill in a faint breeze
which also bore the distant report of a
musketoon or blunderbuss

  the sparse stubble of a cornfield
pricked up reaped before its time by
starving soldiery but it was a straggling
crop that had sprung up by itself un-
tended by man

  it had once been a field of battle and
in spots more green than the rest spikes
of stalks grew up through the white ribs
of contestants who had fallen there and
had never been removed

  the sun moved on its course and an
hour passed before any sound broke the
stillness of the sandpit an unmistak-
ably feminine voice asked what news
jorian are they coming back

  a young man who had been lying very
still beneath a low part of the rim look-
ing out toward die burning village
sighed heavily without answering and
crouching limped toward one of the lad-
ders one leg was bandaged with
bloody rags and he winced as his weight
came upon it he had been shot
through the calf a week before and the
wound had developed infection and was
slow to heal

  he came across the pit and stood be-
fore his companion without raising his
eyes from the sand at his feet while he

clicked his dagger nervously to and fro
in its sheath

  she a girl under twenty with long
fair hair in braids wound around her
head looked at him sharply with her
large blue eyes

  speak jorian yonge what is the
matter are they coming come do
you think me a camp trull to tremble at
bad news

  this stung him and he raised his eyes
she saw that his face was haggard and
strained as he replied

  they will never come hanne die
white bears were stronger and my coun-
trymen are dead

  without showing emotion she said
and that means

  who knows if they think to fol-
low the tracks backward they will find
us we can not leave here until night
or they will surely see us if we are not
noticed by then-there are still two

horses in the beechwood-

 and then-

  i have friends in the spanish nether-
lands we will go there where there is no
fighting i will find you shelter and
employment and you can go your way
and i mine	

  she looked at him quizzically

  jorian you saved my life months ago
from the mercenaries who killed my fam-
ily you have since kept me at your
side and saved me from harm in war and
insult in camp comrades are we
jorian i have learned to fight beside
you to cook for you to speak your lan-
guage you have never spoken a word
of love to me nor have i sought it i
do not seek it now

  we are companions jorian and you
shall not put me from you jorian
there are no separations for us two our
ways lie together

  the young mans face flushed under
the tan and dirt he was about to speak

                     w t-
the master has a narrow escape



when a noise upon the hills outer slope
startled him to silence

  he snatched up a short bell-mouthed
gun from a small pile of similar weapons
and scuttled up the ladder hardly limp-
ing in his hurry

  the girl heard him call stop where
you are as he leveled his blunderbuss
but flying to his side she paused

  high and shrill rang a childish cry
dont you hurt my father

jorian leapt over the rim and reap-
peared almost at once supporting an
aged man swart and wrinkled in the face
gray-haired eyes bloodshot and mum-
bling vacantly to himself as though
stunned by horror he staggered as he
walked and a little girl about ten years
old who followed him clung tightly to
his hand

  they looked toward the ruined village
nothing stirred there now and all seemed
very quiet and peaceful so they took the
old man and child down the ladder

  noticing how his eyes glistened at the
sight of a lump of dark bread partly
ground bark powdered to a coarse flour
and the rest rough corn meal the girl
broke it and shared between the oldster
and the child their meager store

  after this had been disposed of and
washed down with thin sour wine which
jorian had discovered in a cask supposed
to be water as it was marked they
seemed much refreshed

  the oldster spoke to the younger man
in rapid german but he understanding
but little the german girl hanne made
reply

  swedish asked the oldster nodding
toward jorian

yes said the girl he was one of a
company of lutheran swedes that were
camped here this past week to rest and
hide from a company of marauders who
w t-

call themselves the white bears this
morning they heard such a doleful cry-
ing from yon village that they could not
keep away they would not let me go
and jorian was too lame

  my poor dear said the oldster your
friends are all dead i and my daughter
were in the village when the white bears
attacked the defenseless people and we
escaped only because they had not reached
the hut where i was hiding before the
swedes came up we ran into the
bushes during the fighting and hid later
when no one was looking our way we
came this way to hide not knowing that
any one was here

  i know the white bears well they
are brigands without any discipline in
their dealings with the helpless they
treat men and women like beasts those
who have money are their enemies those
who have none are punished because they
have it not their leader is a grim brute
called bloody boris balta

  once they served as mercenaries un-
der tilly and pappenheim now they fight
for themselves and have committed un-
speakable outrages everywhere they have
driven human being naked into the streets
of their villages they have taken after their
flesh has been pierced with needles or cut
to the bone with saws others they have
scalded with boiling water and hunted
with fierce dogs

  people so poor that they are forced
to live on grass leaves and bones that
they have broken to bits and boiled for
food are tortured to force them to dis-
close treasures which it is plain they have
not

  do i think they will come here per-
haps maybe not who can tell they
are very busy now

  i supposed your swedes came from
the woods and i followed their trades
the white bears may do the same we


weird tales

ought to be preparing for them seven
musketoons you say that is very good
i see you also have a swedish leather
cannon those are the most effective
weapons of their size that i have ever
seen let us mount it pointing at the
village so if they come we will be able
to give them a hot welcome

  jorian agreed and as the three older
members were working he said did
you ever see lennart torstenson who in-
vented that no he is the greatest of
generals and the quickest of wit save
only our hero king he discovered that
our artillery was too heavy and cumber-
some to be placed quickly so he had a
number of pieces made like this

  of course you know that it is a light
steel tube wrapped and bound with strips
of wet rawhide when the hide dries
it tightens and the cannon is then strong
enough for a smaller charge than that
used in the regular artillery they
weigh about seventy-five pounds and one
is easily carried on a mans shoulder to
places where no other cannon can go
our company made this one and mounted
it as you see upon a tripod of saplings
it has been a great help to us in a pinch
when we had to retreat or advance
quickly

  are you really afraid that they will
come there are two horses in the
beeches down below if we can leave here
unseen after dark

  the girl hanne translated and was
answered

  if you have horses we can strike a
bargain i will help you if you will
help me let us go down into the shade
while we talk achsah

  the child came up the ladder

  yes father

  stay here and keep watch for us if
you see the bad men coming this way let
us know at once

the sun had perceptibly declined
toward the west as the three took
their seats at the shady end of the pit
here were piled tier upon tier of iron-
bound chests and seating himself upon
one the oldster fished out a pipe from an
inner pocket and began to fill it when
hanne stopped him

  those chests are filled with gunpow-
der herr-

  gunther nodded the oldster laying
down his unlighted pipe gottfried gun-
ther is my name though my great-grand-
father whom i remember dimly said that
his father was french and had a french
name gunnar there were a lot of
brothers then and a terrible thing hap-
pened which i was never told about so
that they separated and went to different
countries changing their names there to
conform with the languages that they had
to learn i have never seen any of them
but i heard from one somewhere in rus-
sia who had the name of naakve gun-
narsson

  that sounds swedish or danish
commented jorian

  maybe it is said gunther indiffer-
ently i only know he was somewhere
in the north he wrote me a long let-
ter before the war and wanted me to come
up and help him make trouble for some
people in a place he hated ponkert in
bohemia or hungary i dont remember
which ever hear of it he said that
was where we all came from once

  the two shook their heads

  well i was a stout burgher then in
magdeburg and i wasnt going to drop
everything to hunt the crane for nothing
a day so i stayed at home and minded
my own business and never heard from
him again it was just a little after that
when the trouble started

  i was unmarried then and had a
small butcher shop of my own with no
cares debts or enemies as far as i knew
the master has a narrow escape



it was back in  when i began to
suffer with nightmares i began to dream
that something dreadful was going to
happen was coming nearer and nearer
all the time i seemed to see a black cloud
that wasnt altogether a cloud but some-
thing alive like nothing i ever saw or
heard of before

  just before this thing came near
enough for me to make out what it was
i would always wake up with a death
sweat on me and i thought it would
pass and be forgotten

  but one night i didnt wake up in
time or maybe i was awake and actually
saw what i thought i dreamed about
god i have prayed night after night
that it was a dream but even yet i dont
know for after that it never came again

  i woke or thought that i awoke and
saw a horrible little man in a black cloak
all huddled up on the foot of my bed
his eyes gleamed like phosphorus in the
dark and i could make out faintly that
he had a very stern impressive look that
commanded more respect than if he had
been a giant instead of a dwarf

  he said gottfried gunther i would
have called upon you before but i have
been very much occupied in france and
england and have not been able to give
jean gunnars children the attention they
deserve my great-grandfathers fath-
er was named jean but i did not know
that then and that is why i do not know
if i dreamed this thing i have just
finished with france and mean to have a
little sport here go where you wish do
what you may you belong to me gott-
fried gunther and you can not escape
know this also wherever you go calam-
ity death and sorrow will be your com-
panions

  it has been as he said i was about
your age then young man i am fifty-five
now and look as well as feel ninety for
twenty-five years i have been hunted over

poor suffering germany i have tried
to get out of the country and have always
been turned back i know that i am
doomed to die here and i feel that not
until my death is accomplished will my
beloved land be free from wars and pes-
tilence

  i believe that the devil has got a hold
upon me but i can think of no reason
that he should have power over me based
upon any act of mine

  he called himself the master and
seemed very angry when i implied that i
had never heard of him

   you will he squeaked in a very
high voice and his cloak lifted like a pair
of great black wings you will hear
more than a little before you see me
again mind now go to your window
and you will see my sign of menace
hanging in the sky

  then it seemed that he grew bloated
beneath his cloak which quivered and
twitched as his body puffed out his face
grew thin and pointed and before i real-
ized what was taking place a monstrous
leather-winged bat huddled clicking its
teeth at me while sharp jet-black talons
tore the bed coverings

  its bulk filled the window and it flew
away i thought i heard a high voice
chirp i am your master and foe of all
the world and i awoke

  i ran to the window a bloody hue
suffused the sky where flamed a long-
tailed comet then i believed my dream
was true

  you must know as well as i that
comets forecast terrible coming events
if ever there was a doubt this comet
would dispel it as also the one which
flamed on st bartholomews bloody
night the great luther himself says

   the heathen write that the comet may arise
from material causes but god creates not one
that does not foretoken a sure calamity


weird tales

  perhaps you have heard the rime that
a couple of swiss lutheran preachers put
forth when this comet was first seen

bight things there be a comet brings

  when it on high doth horrid range

wind famine plague and death to kings

  war earthquake floods and direful change

  just a little later the protestants rose
in rebellion in bohemia and this terrible
war began

  you both were not born then you
know of no condition but war and so it
seems natural to you but to me who had
lived in peace the change was dreadful
in the last few years i have been a wan-
derer and i have seen things that seem
impossible three-quarters of the popu-
lation of germany are dead you know
how people are starving how villages by
hundreds are flat to their foundations and
others without an inhabitant but do you
know in places that men are no better
than beasts these very white bears
are cannibals they eat the men and
women they capture if they lack other
meat

  i was in worms when this very band
was attacked and dispersed as they were
cooking in a great cauldron human legs
and arms which they had obtained from
criminals cut down from the gallows
they are wild croats bohemians wends
wallons renegades of all types equal in
nothing but ferocity and pitilessness

  it did not take long for man to retro-
grade pestilence the black death fol-
lowed the comets trail none but the
vilest of men had sufficient contempt for
death to dig the graves of the plague-in-
fected and to tend the sick some were
heartless enough to infect others that their
business might continue and they scat-
tered infected matter along the streets to
keep the pestilence at its height and them-
selves in luxury

  too these ravens as they were called
would seek people who had enemies and

for a bribe would snatch these enemies
away and hustle them off to some hos-
pital where they were herded in with
plague sufferers and soon died from de-
spair or sickness unless they could pay
more than the previous offer

  if one resisted on the way they
shouted out that he was delirious from
suffering and no one would help

  these grave-diggers and nurses were
drawn from desperate criminals and re-
leased galley slaves so weary of life that
any other existence than that in the chains
was acceptable

  at magdeburg in  i lost my
maid through these men i had sent her
to a public house to fetch beer where she
met a company of grave-diggers and
plague attendants one of whom seized
her and forced her to dance with him

  at the end of the dance he threw his
cloak over her head breathed in her face
and said in a rough voice ha wench
that will do for you you will have to pay
for it she was so terrified that she fell
ill as soon as she returned home and died
the night after

  i was not married then i met my
wife during the siege of magdeburg by
wallenstein in  she was one of
the peasant girls from outside the city
that had come in for shelter we always
kept our cattle inside the city walls and
often inside the houses besides which we
had a large herd of swine she used to
come to my butcher shop for meat and
we talked and laughed and had fine times
while the enemy was pounding at the
walls

  let me tell you young people it is
the peasants who suffer most in these
wars in the beginning they are poor
and are glad to have the chance of en-
riching themselves by plunder but they
support themselves the while by their
pay as mercenaries
the master has a narrow escape



  the nobles also who are so numer-
ous and grind us down take advantage
of the opportunity to indulge their pri-
vate grudges and robberies

  then comes along some leader of
ability like wallenstein that can handle
both nobles and peasants and keeps them
in his service by indulging their evil in-
stincts but afterward what

  those of the peasants that hang onto
their farms support all the rest their
food is stolen their women abused their
men taken to fight no hospitals take
care of them it is cheaper to hire a new
recruit than to cure an old one

  and afterward again the peasant be-
comes a slave not daring to lift his head
and look his brutal lord in the face it
has been thus before it will be so now
if you want to live and be happy europe
is no place for you you must seek some
new land and begin all over again

  well i wouldnt let the peasant girl
go back again when the siege was over
we decided that the worst had come and
gone and that we would marry so our
love affair that had dragged along and
made seven months of imprisonment
happy ended with that not that we
werent happy then dont let me fright-
en you young woman its just an old
mans way of talking thats all

  wallenstein gave up in disgust and
took his mercenaries away and the next
year was the happiest in my life there
were rumors of wars but none came near
us

  gustavus adolphus your swedish
king was avoiding a vast horde of men
commanded by pappenheim and tilly
there were a number of swedish soldiers
in magdeburg at that time and tilly at-
tacked our city to force the lutherans to
come to our assistance your fellow
swedes under dietrich von falkenburg
swore to hold out to the death and we

burghers agreed with high enthusiasm
and manned the walls

  that was in march of  and we
held out against terrible odds until may
twentieth our food was almost entire-
ly gone at the beginning of the siege at
its end people were feeding upon grass
and leaves in one park at least the
very bark was stripped from the trees
and if some one should chance to trap a
rat or small bird a dozen were ready to
snatch it from him

  a woman was discovered to have fed
upon her own child and the sharp edge
of the headsmans ax sated her hunger
that was early in may before the city
fell many starving wretches had main-
tained their worthless lives in similar
manners

  but we would not give in that way
meant death for all every day we
looked for help but none came we
could not know that it would never come
that the cowardly elector of saxony
would not help your brave king and so
we fought on and grew weak and failed
and pappenheim took the city by storm

  day and night went on an unceasing
din of wild sounds the clashing of
swords the shoudng of battle cries the
groans of the dying and the crash of fall-
ing stones and timbers and crumbling
walls the air was full of smoke from
fires started by the red-hot balls that were
hurled among us crumbling mortar
rained down from the ramparts where the
missiles struck they even rigged up an
old stone-hurler like those the ancients
used some called it a trebuchet and some
a mangonel i dont know what the real
name was i was a butcher not a
scholar but they hurled in dead men
and dead horses over the walls hoping to
start an epidemic

  we sent out a spy in hopes that he
could sneak through the lines and reach


weird tales

gustavus adolphus but they caught him
and early die next morning we heard a
screaming high in the air where soared
our spy still living they had bound
him hand and foot and fired him into the
city where he struck on one of the towers
of our beautiful cathedral and fell to the
pavement below crushed leaving a
blotch upon the fair masonry carvings

  after that we sent out no more spies

  i see your powder here is the corn
granulated type one of the more
friendly disposed of our captors told me
after the city had been captured that they
had been making their own powder on
the spot they said that this serpentine
powder was very weak but we within
magdeburg found it strong enough to
beat down our walls but before they did
it they suffered and so did we

  they fired balls of granite of iron
and of lead they heated iron balls red-
hot and rolled them into their cannon
muzzles where they ignited the powder
and the glowing missile was hurled
among our narrow crooked streets and
old wooden buildings

  eventually however a breach was
made in the wall and tillys men rushed
for it we were ready and waiting
plumes of smoke mounted high from the
fires where we melted lead and pitch we
hurried the kettles to the edges of the
gap while other townsmen met the mer-
cenaries and contested the way

  men shrieked in agony burned and
scalded also with boiling oil and blinded
by barrels of unslaked lime that we
poured down upon them

  then there was a lull but they came
again and we had not time or material or
men to beat them back may th they
stormed the walls and magdeburg fell
mighty magdeburg which had laughed
at wallenstein and which we thought im-
pregnable

illys mercenaries were crazy for
plunder and rapine and knew no
law or master when they had conquered
except their own brutal desires they
wanted money and revenge for their
dead they were filled with blood-lust
and more than all the rest they wanted
women all were to be found in mag-
deburg

  against orders the wild croats
rushed up and down the streets massa-
cring every man they met and throwing
firebrands into the houses until smoke
and flame arose on all sides the wood
and plaster structures were destroyed
only our twin-spired cathedral the
churches and stonebuilt houses stood in-
tact

  my wife and i had fled with a large
crowd of about four thousand people
into the cathedral for shelter and the
doors were barred

  the conquerors respected our sanc-
tuary but not that of the churches one of
which we could see when they burst into
it and killed many women huddled there

  one whole day they plundered and
killed tilly-the devil die murderer-
came into magdeburg the following
morning he sat a bony charger before
our refuge and promised us security
while looking over the ruins

  he was a tall haggard-looking man
dressed in a short slashed green satin
jacket with a long red feather on his high
crowned hat with large bright eyes peer-
ing from beneath his deeply furrowed
brow a stiff mustache under his pointed
nose

  we had no choice in the matter the
cathedral doors were opened and we four
thousand came out pale hungry and
weak we found that we were almost
all that was left of the population there
were twenty thousand stark bodies in the
streets and the elbe was lined with
corpses of those who had fled fire and

sword only to drown in the river i
heard tilly remark to an officer near by
as we marched past that no such a siege
has been seen since the destruction of
troy and jerusalem

  we went forth unharmed under the
protection of stria orders in our favor
and we scattered in search of food

  later i joined a small band of sol-
diers while my wife became one of the
many camp followers with the difference
that she was faithful to me alone and did
not sell her favors to any one like most
of the other women

  achsah there was bom on the march
one day i lagged behind with her moth-
er and later rejoined my company they
followed still while we fighting men
fought over most of germanys bishop-
rics and palatinates at one time or an-
other and when she had grown to be
eight years old the three of us came back
again to magdeburg

  rude huts had been rebuilt around
the cathedral and we settled in one and
tried to start life over soon dreams
came again and i felt unsafe

  shortly after our community was
raided by brigands and my wife was
killed by a looter we have since wan-
dered in fear of our persecutor the mas-
ter

the old man paused his story with
numerous pauses for translations to
jorian had lasted until the sun was near
the western hills

  gunther said jorian did you ever
here of wineland the fertile country in
the west which leif ericsson discov-
ered i have heard that it has been set-
tled now by the english surely that is
far enough away so that if we could get
there we would all be safe from this mas-
ter you fear

  wineland wineland hanne knit-
ted her brows then suddenly smiled i

know what you mean jorian but it is
called america after amerigus who dis-
covered it

  it is not defended the young swede
stoutly this amerigus is a cheat
children you are both wrong gun-
ther put in america was discovered
by kristofer kolon but even there i
would not feel safe the master would
surely follow

  the reaaion to this statement was pre-
cipitating a very pretty quarrel when sud-
denly a low call from the platform above
hushed the three

  father bad men are coming the
little girl came down the ladder

  at once the dispute was forgotten
swarming up the ladders the three
crouched low and peered toward the vil-
lage many men were visible moving in
little clumps and knots of fighters that
marched with two or three men armed
with musketoons or arquebuses in the
center with perhaps a dozen others bear-
ing pikes and halberds surrounding for
the gunners proteaion while they re-
loaded their clumsy weapons

  it did not behoove men in numbers
or alone to walk unwarily in germany
at that time

  they were moving steadily across the
fallow fields toward the hillock and
gunther wrung his hands in dismay

  what are we to do where can my
little girl be safe he moaned to him-
self and then with sudden resolution
turned to the others

  take achsah he said and flee to
the beechwood bending low that ye may
not be seen and by firing off these guns
already loaded they will think that many
men are here and will come slowly on
giving you three time to escape

  how about yourself asked hanne
are we to run like cowards and leave
you to fight our battles we will die

with you or flee with you but we will not
separate

  jorian nodded vigorously when state-
ment and answer were translated

   we stick he said succinctly and lit
the end of a piece of rope blowing the
coal in readiness for firing the cannon

  ah you are brave gunther smiled
sadly is it my fault that this curse lies
upon me think upon our situation
over yonder swarm the brigands they
are bound to capture us wherever we may
flee for reasons of my own i know
they are searching for me

  last night too i had another wak-
ing dream in which i was marked today
as the masters prey i think i can cheat
him and i am going to try somewhere
he lurks biding his time until it is dark
when he can strike i have never seen
him in daylight which i believe he fears
so until actual sundown we are safe

   i believe that i have a plan that will
save you and if you promise to take my
little achsah with you somewhere that
will be secure where you can give her
christian upbringing and swear to guard
her always i will make you rich besides
ridding you of immediate pursuit

  the two looked at each other hanne
nodded slowly and jorian replied

  we are in poverty and have little
choice if it is your wish and you have
money give us enough to go to-

  gunther raised a hand in a peremptory
gesture for silence

  do not say whither ye go who
knows where open wide the masters ears
for our speech here is money go and
go at once

  from his rags he drew out a broad
leather belt which he handed to hanne

  haste ye now to the beech grove he
commanded

  she ran down the hill darting from
bush to thicket bending low to avoid

discovery from the brigands who strag-
gled across the field

  hark ye yonge guard her well
watch over my girl as i guard ye today
that belt is filled with gold spend with
care and run swede run

  jorian leapt with the word and disap-
peared among the beeches

   the little maid had sat quietly in the
pit below and absorbed in her own
amusements had not listened to the low
conversation above so she looked up in
surprize as her father knelt and removed
her scarlet coat he strained her to his
breast in a crushing passionate embrace
murmuring guttural words of endearment

  go thou into the beech wood lieb-
chen he said after an agonized moment
of yearning love find the pretty lady
and the big man

  oh a game a game she crowed
ecstatically and would have set out at
once over the edge of the sand-pit but
turned back

  come you come too you find
but gottfried gunther shook his large
head his brow was furrowed with
anxiety already he could hear the high
conversation of the brigands and the
suns round edge was nicked ragged with
the trees upon the western hills but he
forced a smile

  father will come and find you all
dear wont that be fun

  she chuckled and climbed up the bank
and sat there frowning

  men come father

  i know darling hurry and find the
pretty lady or she will be lost dont
let the men see you or the game will be
spoiled

  she was gone

gunther staggered with the relief
but the weakness was momentary
the sun was a semicircle of garnet on a
purple base a dark cloud was driving
the master has a narrow escape



toward him from the east against the
wind

  he heard the shout of the white bears
and knew that they had come upon his
tracks in mud near a spring where the
child had stopped to drink he brought
up an armful of the musketoons and ar-
ranged them upon the rim of the forta-
lice near the cannon the smoldering
rope sent up a thread of bluish-gray

  with a great effort he picked up the
leather cannon tripod and all and set it
in a more strategic position

  then came many men pressing for-
ward crowding up the incline he fired
the charges of seven guns among them
but with little hesitation they came on

  in desperation gunther swung the
cannon muzzle a trifle more toward a
knot of men and ignited the charge a
pound and a half of ragged metal and
pebbles tore into the thick of them and
the hesitation became a rout

  a hideous row of curses threats and
cries of pain followed but gunther did
not hear them

  the small cannon too light for its
charge had recoiled from its insecure po-
sition in the sand and lay with one leg
of the tripod cracked on the floor of the
sand-pit gunther half stunned gasped
close by

  to him there came the stirring notes
of a trumpet and he knew the white
bears were regaining order he stumbled
to his feet and raised the cannon an
instants scrutiny told him that the can-
non was hopeless as an engine of de-
fense with the ruined tripod but an idea
came to him as he stared wildly about
and quickly he arranged the childs scar-
let cloak in a corner to resemble what he
hoped might be mistaken at a quick
glance for achsah asleep

  the sun was out of sight now but as
with haste and frantic fingers he reloaded
the cannon with a smaller charge that was

composed of powder and rags he saw an
oddly shaped cloud sweep darkly above
poise there hover and sink gradually
down

 he felt its approach as a menacing
presence loathsome huge steadily drop-
ping it came nearer until at last its shape-
less horror assumed the alien shape of the
master as he had dwelt upon the planet
nithrys as it spun in slow orbit about
algol the demon star

   lapsing then into merciful insanity he
threw back his head and when the white
bears came over the lip of the hollow they
were greeted with a neighing high-
pitched mad laugh like a scream they
gathered about him as he stood there
looking up still holding the smoking
rope in his hand and one seized him by
the shoulder as he babbled on pointing
above

   boris balta and the others looked up
but saw only that a cloud had crossed the
sun and cast a shadow into the hollow
which was crowded with brigands

   he presented a daggar at gunthers
breast

   tell us this joke cup-companion who
dared to steal the money of the white
bears search him kaspar while he
tells us so we may all laugh while we are
killing him

   for a second gottfrieds wavering in-
telligence drifted back to his tired brain

   the jet talons of the master were very
near he was about to pounce in a
second his body vampire-blighted would
become a hideous night prowler and a
dead-alive slave

   lets all laugh together in hell he
shouted and touched his burning rope to
the leather cannon which pointed into
the open box of dull black grains which
lay at the base of that great pile of pow-
der chests

   and after that it mattered little to
gottfried gunther or any of the white

jorian and hanne holding the quiv-
ering child between them deep in the
shelter of the beechwood saw a vast black
shadow settle down upon the hill top
otherwise the sky was cloudless

  they heard the shouts of men the re-
ports of musketoons and the boom of the
cannon they saw lance-points glint on
the summit of the earthworks then a
deafening roar

  a rushing wind howled through the
tree tops the air was full of dirt and
dust a fountain of earth sprang up like
the trunk of a thick dark tree growing
where the fortified hill had been a pike
twirling end over end no bigger than a
straw in the blue above came hissing
down into the wood followed by a thin
drizzle of red mud and bits of unidenti-

tattered shadow like a distant cloud flee-
ing fast fast toward the east

  over the head of weeping achsah the
swedish man and the german maiden
kissed soberly without rapture

hartford upon the tryall of achsah
young  fby 

adam grant aged about  years tes-
- tifieth that formerly going to reap in
a meadow at windsor his land he was to
work on lay near to john youngs land
it came to the thoughts of the said john
youngs daughter the present prisoner
to walk through the meadow and it fell
that a poisonous snake stung him in the
ancle as she came near

  without balm applied she bandaged
the ancle saying you shall not suffer and
he was shortly cured which he is certain
could not be but by unnatural arts and
magicks

  the deponent also saith that since
nearly a year ago his son ansel has found
no comfort in anything but being near
the prisoner which adam grant deemed
not seemly and so sent him to live in
wethersfield

  shortly after he being very well as to
ye outward vew was suddenly taken very
ill and moped about not working or rel-
ishing his food upon which adam grant
went to achsah young and bad her un-
bewitch his child or he would beat her
hart out wherefore achsah sayd god
forbad she should hurt ansel and wrote
him something which adam grant could
not read but when ansel had received it
he imediately after was well and would
not say to his father what it was

  adam grant testifieth again saying
that it is a matter of common knowledge
in windsor that the present prisoner has
a yellow bird which was brought from the
canary islands and without doubt is her
familiar spirit she being seen often in its

company talking and laughing to it like
if it had a christian soule

goodwife grant aged  years tes-
tifieth that before her son ansel
went to wethersfield that she slept a
night at john youngs house being be-
nighted by a storm of thunder and light-
ning although she knew by report
that the prisoner was a sabbath breaker
and one who told fortunes she went to
bed with her but in great fear meaning
not to slepe

  in the midst of the night she woke and
heard a soft sound like a striking of
wings against the windowe but saw no
thing there but noticed that in a comer
of the room a spinning wheel was turning
slowly of itself she then remembered
that the prisoner had been said to have
been able to spin so great a quantity of
fine linen yarn as the deponent did never
know nor hear of any other woman that
could spin so much

  she shook the prisoner to wake her
crying out then looking up she saw a
light about the bignes of her too hands
glance along the edge of the room near
the floor to the harth ward and afterwards
saw it no more

   she also testifieth that she told the pris-
oner she would report this and achsah
did beg her to say no thing and all would
be well but the next day having men-
tioned the matter to mistress kent good-
wife grant did go to slepe in dread of
some hurt lying in bed with a good
fire giving such light that one might see
all over that room where she then was
she heard a noise and presently some-
thing fell on her legs with violence and
oppressed her stomach as if it would have
pressed the breath out of her body then
appeared an ugly shaped thing like a dog
having a head such that she clearly and

distinctly knew to be the head of achsah
young this dog growled fiercely that
if she had her strength she would tear
goodwife grant in peses and vanished

  goodwife grant then sat up in bed
and saw a black face at the window
which looked like john youngs black
slave asaph it grinned and nodded at
her till she fell senseless and when she
knew things again morning had come

  goodwife grant also testifieth that a
girl taken by john young to work in the
house achsah being ill did tend achsah
and seeing a silk hood and blew apron
in a closet would have tried them on
meaning them no hurt but a noise
frighted her away and she saw that ach-
sah was rolling about in bed very hot
and red and talking to herself in some
strange speech which seemed to the girl
not holy she asked achsah what she
spoke and was answered german follow-
ing which achsah began to sing a silly
and useless song about love and maytime
and a lover who had gone away she
asked achsah if she had sung what eng-
lish she could then sing german and
then she sung that which she called ger-
man but which the girl believed to be a
witchs call for something patted at the
window and the girl said what creature
is that with a great head and wings and
no boddy and all black achsah said
that is my father and the girl sayd how
your father your father is aslepe down-
stairs and achsah sayd no thing after but
maide as tho she was aslepe

mistress kent aged  testifieth
that upon a sunday when all others
had left her alone in the house she being
bedridden did look from the window
across the field towards john youngs
great barn and saw the present prisoner
come from the direction of the village

and enter the barn quickly like one who
would not be seen whereupon a boye
seemingly like ansel grant did come
also a little later and the barn doors did
open before him without his having nede
to touch them so that he went in be-
fore the people came from the church
achsah came out again and went into her
house but the boye she did not see more
later when she mentioned it to goodwife
grant she was told by her that ansel
was in wethersfield so that she knew it
could not be him but the devill instead
in the shape of a boye

  mistress kent speaking of this matter
to achsah young was laughed at ach-
sah saying granny you can see no farther
than the chickens in your yard and then
she thought that if this girl was naught
as folkes suspect may be she will smite
my chickens and quickly after one chick-
en dyed and she remembred she had
heard if they were bewitched they would
consume within and she opened it and
it was consumed in ye gisard to water
and wormes and divers others of them
droped she never having seen any chick-
en that was so consumed with wormes

james frye aged  testifieth that
two years agone he had calfe very
strangely taken after achsah young had
passed by looking long on the calfe it
roared very strangely and unwonted for
a space of six or seven hours so he sent
for her to see the calfe which he had
tyed in the lott to a great post lying on
the ground and the calfe ran away with
that post as if it had bine a fether and
ran amonge indian corne and pulled up
many hills and stood still

  she followed and looked on the calfe
and it sa a running till it came to a fence

and stood still

   he testified that he spoke harshly to
her and named her witch whereupon she
wept much and begged him pity her for
she was sorely tempted and he saying
how why are you tempted she said no
thing but went away and he saw her meet
the black slave who patted her shoulder
and made as if to comfort her

   that night he could not sleep and hear-
ing a noyse about the house like a beast
that was knoct with an axe he got up and

an insert by nehemiah pratt secy

after the above evidence was heard
 by the court achsah young was
taken to the common jail for safe keeping
where she was questioned frequently
many times a day for three weeks her
proud bearing and spirit gradually broke
because of the cold of her prison and her
harsh treatment her watchman said
he often heard her talking to herself or
some one that he could not see and she
pled often for mercy but never called
upon our saviour so that he knew she
was accursed and would finally confess

  the watchman made noises all night
that she might not slepe and frequent
visitors would question her at any hour

  goody pew mistress knight and her
daughter and goodwife simonds all
came the last night before the second
hearing and pressed her to name any
other witch in town and to receive con-
solation from the minister for the welfare
of her soul

   the hardened prisoner protested that
she was innocent and denied everything
saying take heed the devile have not

you and i have sinns enough to an-
swer for now and i will not add another
this reported in writing by goody pew

  pray pray for me she said and
that will console me

  goody pew saying we did not come
to pray but to work held her tight and
the other women then removed her cloth-
ing and searched for witch marks prick-
ing her with pins everywhere it seemed
to them a mark might be but as she felt
the pain as was proved by her shrieks and
cries they saw that they would have to
search farther and began to cut off the
long hair of her head but had great dif-
ficulty a proof of her witchcraft being
that though she was at other times a weak
and light girl yet she was then so strong
and extreme heavy that the four women
had long work to cut off all her hair
achsahcrying bitterly as if she had been
beaten all the time

  they found the spot she had tried to
hide a dark place sunken in and which
did not bleed and knowing that she was
found out she said to goody pew yes
i am a witch go away go away and let
me slepe

  goody pew said to the other women
we will be merciful and fair and prove
her beyond doubt let us try her by
water and be sure

  so they took her as she was to the duck
pond bound hand and foot and put her
on the water she swam upon the water
like a cork and when goody pew labored
to press her down she buoyed up and they
saw that the water refused to take her and
knew her for a true witch and servant of
the devill

jonas jesop of wethersfield aged 
testifieth that being warned by his
friend adam grant that achsah young
might come thence to pursue and lead


weird tales

astray young ansel grant he made every
effort to kepe her off but the boye being
ill asaph a small black slave belonging
to john young of winsor brought the
boye a letter and showed him a glass to
see his face in as jonas jesop supposed
but the boye crying out achsah achsah
he took away the glass and saw in it as
through a window the shape of a girl
moving and smiling which quickly fad-
ed when he took the glass

  the next day she rode there from win-
sor and would not be kept from his room
nor gott away when she was there and
one time mistress jesop bid her go away
and thrust her from the boy but she
turned againe and said she would looke
on him

  mistress jesop sayd you are a witch
you know you are why do you not let
the boy alone she sayd i am not mali-
tious and do not mean mischiefe why do
they provoake me if they think i am a
witch why do they not let me come
into the church

  dated march   wethersfield
taken upon oath before us jabez penhale
zebulon clawson exhibited in court
march   attests nehemiah pratt
secy

  here achsah cried out they seek my
innocent blood the magistrat replied
who she sayd every body being spoken
to about triall by swiming she sayd the
divill that caused me to come here can
keep me up

  the magistrat sayd you admitted your
guilt she sayd well well if i did be done
with the matter do not make me suffer
ye asked me before goody pew to name
a witch look in that corner where the
black man of my fathers is standing
there is the one to blame for this take
him and hang him too the people
looked where the slave was said to be
but he was not there to be seen though
she kept pointing there and saying can

you not see him how he is laughing
if you do not kill him you will be very
sorry

  but asaph the black slave was not to
be found and has never been seen here
since so that many take him for the devill
in human shape as i think the magistrat
did when he sayd to the jury before their
verdict

  just as god has his human servants
his church on earth so also has the devill
these witches and wizards are won by
him by his appearance in many shapes
he deceives them and makes them his al-
lies to ruin their fellows we cannot
reach the devill but today we have his
servant whom if we suffer her to live will
injure us again even though she may
not be able to destroy the life of her
neighbor by her incantations still if she
intends to do so it is right that she
should hang as seen by the evidence
the party accused has made a league with
the devill and hath been at known prac-
tices of witchcraft the devill cares
nothing for witches as you can see by his
allowing her to be taken there are two
reasons for this his hatred and malice
toward all men and his insatiable desire
to have the witches not sure enough of
his hatred till then bring in your judge-
ment

note by nehemiah pratt secy

  a pathetic incident made me almost
sorry for this abominable witch a
child was borne in the prison probably
a devil-chick and bound out to ansel
grant who had come of age and arrived
in hartford after the execution he de-
nied his parents when they sought to
speak with him and pretended not to
know them but engaged himself to mein-
teine and well educate achsahs sonne

  he has since disappeared and no one
knows where he has gone to dwell john
young likewise has sold his property and
moved away and thus ends the first case
of witchcraft in quohnectacut god
grant it may be the last
the game

by dorothy norwich

mallory knew that he was being murdered by degrees knew that it was useless
to fight-yet he made sure that his killers would be robbed
of the fruits of their crime

mallory rose from his bed and
stumbled weakly across the bed-
room floor to the bathroom ad-
joining from the hall came the sac-
charinely sweet voice of his wife

  what are you doing dear

  something in the cloying tone irritated
mallory getting a drink he an-
swered pettishly

  but id have gotten it for you

  get it myself mallory retorted
shortly im not dead-yet he al-
lowed himself to pause suggestively be-
fore uttering the word yet so that it
took on a grim significance utterly for-
eign to it

  with a nice precision he dropped two
white pellets into a glass his lips lifted
themselves in a snarling grin as he
watched the water slowly cloud and then
become milky

  his unnaturally bright eyes fixed on
the door mallory drained the glass
rinsed it thoroughly and returned it to its
holder a giddiness came over him at
his cry his wife accompanied by the
doaor entered the room together they
helped him into bed

  ive warned you about undue exer-
tion the doaors voice hypocrite
mallory wanted to shout at him de-
nounce him call him murderer in-
stead he lay still veiling his eyes with
half-closed lids lest they betray his secret
triumph

  presently he looked up at them the
little man and the large woman the
womans white forehead her peculiar-


colored eyes that actually small some-
how managed to give an impression of
bigness her lips full curved and greedy

  there was a similarity mallory noted
between the woman and her lover de-
spite the mans inferior height and weak
chin the same furtiveness of eye was
there and the lips full curved greedy

  the womans voice interrupted his
mental comparisons

  a weak sleeping-potion perhaps
she was suggesting

  sleeping-potion mallory could have
shrieked his dreadful mirth fools did
they think he didnt know did they
suppose him so utterly simple that he had
not been aware this long time of the des-
perate game they were playing but he
was playing too they didnt know that
but he was

  the thought tickled mallory and for
the moment he aaually smiled yes he
was playing a sudden bitterness welled
up in him alone three miles from the
nearest neighbor-five from the town
helpless sick old before his time he sat
in this strange game he against the
other two with the conspirators until
this very morning holding the high cards

  the woman put her arm under his
head and raised it slightly his eyes met
those of the doaor as he held the glass
against his lips there was fear in the
furtive eyes and strain it pleased mal-
lory greatly the man was breaking a
year and a half is a long time they
hadnt expeaed him to survive so many
-sleeping-potions

                    w t-
the game



  the glass emptied mallory lay back on
his pillows the room seemed darker
than it had a few minutes ago ah well
that last card of his would soon be played
now

  and it had been luck sheer luck-or
had it been the machination of a tardy
justice-that had enabled him to see to
its playing

  hendricks from the next farm had
been in to see him just passing by he
had said and had dropped in to see how
mallory was getting along it had taken
but a minute to slip hendricks the letter
he had kept by him for months and se-
cure his promise to deliver it that same
afternoon

  it might even have reached its destina-
tion now the thought made mallorys
head swim fright seized him he must
keep his mind clear he wasnt going to
be cheated of living it all over again be-
fore he died with difficulty he mar-
shaled his senses into some semblance of
order

  he had been thinking of hendricks
he could have said they are murdering
me for my insurance money but what
would hendricks have said what would
they have said delirium thats
what they would have said his mind
is going besides he was too far gone
for help

  he could have written it in his letter
but to what purpose the electric chair
for the pair of them probably and hed
have the womans soul on his hands
wasnt it enough to have endured ten
years of her here on earth without hav-
ing to bear with her in hell as well

  no the way he had chosen was best

his thin body began to shake with re-
pressed mirth it was so grotesquely
funny and that insurance policy they
had persuaded him to take out two years
w t-

ago the policy that an ordinary farmer
had to sweat blood to keep up that pol-
icy that meant ease for them and spelled
death for him that fat insurance policy
if they only knew

  unable to control himself longer mal-
lory shouted his triumph only it didnt
sound like a shout it was more like a
rattle his emaciated frame shook and
trembled his vision slightly blurred
now beheld the faces of the lovers bend-
ing over him a little shaken they looked
yet indecently eager

  vultures they wondered why he
laughed or did they know he was laugh-
ing perhaps they thought it was the
death paroxysm no matter they would
know shortly

  it was hard suddenly to breathe a
crushing weight sat astride his chest a
stiff snarling grin parted mallorys lips
and froze upon them

  they would know very soon now

they sat stiffly uneasily on the edges
of their chairs the little man and
the large woman beads of sweat damp-
ened the mans forehead he wiped
them away nervously with the back of
his hand a pearly dew also sat upon the
upper lip of die woman and die dabbed
at it with a handkerchief limp with the
perspiration from her large hands

  their greedy puzzled eyes were fas-
tened upon the man behind die desk their
ears straining to catch every word obliv-
ious of the tap of the typewriters the
murmur of voices that came to diem
slightly muffled from the outer offices of
the great insurance company they cen-
tered their attention upon the adjuster

  he was handing the woman a letter
she took it with hands that trembled a
little the doctors anxious eyes followed
the lines of the brief note over her
shoulder


weird tales

   i am committing suicide you will find the box
of poison tablets in the bathroom medicine chest
there will be two missing

mallory

  still uncomprehending the lovers
turned their gaze back to the insurance
man what was it he was saying the
policy contained an iron-bound suicide
clause yes they remembered that now
it hadnt seemed important then they
hadnt feared suicide

  the doctors lips were suddenly dry
and he tried to moisten them with a
tongue as hot and parched as a lizards
the womans mouth sagged

  in event of the insured committing

suicide this policy becomes null and
void not the exact words but the gist
of them

  the eyes of the man and woman met
understanding slowly dawning that last
choking rattle of mallorys the sardonic
gleam in his glazing eyes

  emptily they rose and made their way
out of the office through the outer offices
with their efficient bustle to the corridor

   softly as if fearing to disturb someone
they closed the door behind them and
upon the clicking of the latch came the
laughter of the dead man mocking
haunting

  they knew now

the lost lady

      continued from page 

many and i assure you its very mystify-
ing a person usually a child or young
woman will become the victim of a
malignant spirit the peasants believe and
this pelting ghost or poltergeist as they
call it in german will follow the poor
thing about fling dishes and light articles
of furniture at her snatch the bedclothes
off her while she sleeps and bite pinch
and scratch her ive seen severe skin-
wounds inflicted on unfortunate children
whod been selected by a poltergeist as its
victim and the parents assured me the
injuries appeared by magic while others
looked on in broad daylight yet no one
could see the hand that inflicted the
scratches or the teeth which bit the
afflicted person id set the whole busi-
ness down as superstitious nonsense but
since i saw what happened to my wife
this morning im not so certain i wasnt
laughing out of turn when i grinned at
those german peasants

  say on monsieur i listen de gran-
din answered

  my wife was dressing this morning
when she suddenly let out a shrill scream
and half fell across the bench before her
vanity i ran to her and when i reached
her i saw across the white skin of her
shoulders the distinct wale of a whip
ive seen just such marks on laborers in
cochin china when the overseer had
lashed them she was almost fainting
when i got to her and babbling some-
thing in khmer which i couldnt under-
stand i picked her up and started to
carry her toward the bed and as i did so
she emitted another cry and crossing the
first diagonal mark was a second wale so
heavy this time that i could see the little
spots of blood starting through the skin
where it had been bruised to the point of
rupture

  i laid her on the bed and ran into the
bathroom to soak a towel in witch hazel
to put across her shoulders he paused
a moment and looked challengingly at us
please remember she was lying on her
back in bed he continued with slow

emphasis her shoulders were pressing
directly on the sheet nothing not even a
bullet from a high-power rifle could have
struck her from beneath through the thick
layers of cotton-felt of the mattress yet
even as i was crossing the room to her
she screamed a third time and when i
reached her there was another whip-mark
crossing the first two at an angle on her
shoulders this happened just as im
telling you he concluded then regarded
us with an almost threatening glance as
he awaited our expressions of polite in-
credulity

  mats out i believe you my friend
de grandin told him it is entirely pos-
sible indeed i am not at all surprized
no on the contrary

  are we arrived good we shall
examine these so strange marks upon
your poor lady and do what we can to
relieve her suffering

  by the way he added as we mounted
the porch steps at what time did
this most unpleasant experience befall
madame

  hildebrand considered a moment
about eight oclock as near as i can re-
member he answered we usually
breakfast at eight but wed overslept this
morning and were hurrying to get down
to the dining-room before rumsen the
cook presented her resignation she
usually resigns if she has to wait a meal
more than half an hour and we were
dressing with one eye on the clock when
thi-bah felt the first pain and the first
mark showed on her skin

  eight oclock de grandin repeated
musingly at six they take her at eight
the phenomenon is observed eh bien
they wasted little time those ones yes
it all fits together admirably i was sure
before now i am certain

  whats that archy asked

  i did but confirm my diagnosis mon-

sieur it is seldom that i am mistaken
this time it seems i am less so than
usual lead us to madame your wife if
you please

xtthy- i exclaimed as we

  v v entered the pleasant chintz-hung
room where young mrs hildebrand lay
then stared at the girl in fatuous hang-
jawed amazement

  norn dun parapluie rose de gran-
din exclaimed softly i suspected it now
i know yes of course observe her
my friend

  i did i couldnt help it i knew it
could not be yet there on the bed before
me lay moneen mcdougal or her twin
sister and stared at us with the wide
hopeless gaze of a dumb thing taken in
a trap and waiting in mute terror for the
hunters knife across its throat

  madame de grandin began softly
deferentially we have heard of your
trouble and are come to aid you

   a tiny parenthesis of puzzled wrinkles
formed between the girls arched black
brows but no sign of understanding
showed in her pale face

  madame he essayed again je suis

un medecin frangais et-

  still no sign of understanding in the
wide frightened gaze

  he paused a moment his little round
blue eyes narrowed in concentrated
thought then launched forth a series of
queer-sounding singsong words which
reminded me of the gibberish with which
chinese laundrymen address each other

  instant recognition shone in her dark
eyes and she answered in a torrent of
droning oddly inflected phrases

   he motioned me forward still convers-
ing in the outlandish dialect and together
we approached the bed turned down the
coverlet and bent to examine her like
most modem young women she wore as

weird tales

her sole undergarment above the waist a
knitted-silk bandeau about her bosoms
and as she had dressed only in her lingerie
when the curious illness overtook her we
had no difficulty in observing the lash-
marks across her cream-satin shoulders
high angry-looking wales they were as
though freshly laid on by a heavy whip
in the hands of a brutally strong tor-
mentor cher dieu de grandin swore
then bent to question her again but
stopped abruptly as she stiffened suddenly
and gave a short terrified exclamation
the sort a patient undergoing odontotrypy
might emit and under our very eyes there
rose across her shoulders another scourge-
mark red ecchymosed swollen it was
as if the skin were inflated from beneath
for a mound like a miniature molehill
rose as we watched and the white skin
turned bright blood-sweating red

  again she trembled in our grasp and
again a red and angry welt showed on her
shoulders from scapular to scapular her
bade showed a wicked criss-cross of ugly
livid wales

  quick mon ami your hypo and some
morphine if you please he cried this
will continue intermittently until-we
must give her surcease of her pain at
once

  i prepared the mercy-bearing syringe
with trembling hands and drove the
needle deep into her quivering arm then
shot the plunger home and as the opiate
took hold upon her tortured nerves she
relaxed from her rigid pose and sank
back slowly on the bed but as she did so
another lash-track appeared on her shoul-
der and now the fragile skin was broken
through and a stain of bright capillary-
blood spread on the linen bedclothes

  good heavens what is it some ob-
scure form of hemophilia i asked

  neither obscure nor hemophilia de
grandin answered grimly it is devil-

ment my friend but devilment we can
do nothing to palliate until costello finds
the one we seek

  costello i echoed in amazement
what has he to do with this poor
childs-

  everything pardieu the frenchman
interrupted now if we do prepare a
bandage pack and soak it well with lead-
water and laudanum we shall have done
all possible until-

  until i prompted as he ceased
speaking and proceeded to prepare the
soothing dressing for the girls lacerated
back

  until the leaden-footed costello be-
stirs himself he returned sharply
have i not said it certainly

  renew the dressing every hour my
friend he bade young hildebrand as we
prepared to leave if her attacks return
with frequency administer these codein
tablets but never more than one in each
half-hour au revoir we shall return
and when we do she will have ceased to
suffer

 you mean shell be- archy

choked then stopped afraid to name the
dread eventuality

  by no means no de grandin
cheered him she will survive mon
vieux nor will she suffer much meantime
but though we do our work away from
here you may be sure that we shall not
be idle

  as the young man looked at him
bewildered he added for ailments such
as this some laboratory work is neces-
sary then smiled as a light of under-
standing broke in the tortured husbands
face

  the plausible explanation is always
best he murmured as we entered my
car and turned toward home

  have you really an idea whats wrong
weird tales



with her i asked its the strangest
case ive ever seen

  but yes my ideas are most certain
he returned although i can not set them
forth in full just now you are perhaps
familiar with stigmata

  only indirectly i answered ive
never seen a case of stigma but from
what ive read i understand its a physical
manifestation of a condition of hysteria
arent certain religious fanatics supposed
to work themselves into a state of ecstasy
and then show marks approximating
wounds on their hands and feet in simu-
lation of the saviors crucifixion-marks
precisement he agreed with a nod
and hysteria is a condition of psycho-
neurosis normal inhibitions are broken
down the conscious mind is in abeyance
you have doubtless seen in psychological
laboratories the hypnotist bid the blood
leave the subjects hand and thereupon
have observed the hand in question go
corpse-pale as the vital fluid gradually
receded

  of course i answered but what
the deuce are you driving at anyway

  i formulate an hypothesis anon we
shall put it to the test i hope

 sympathetic magic

detective sergeant jeremiah cos-
tello was pacing gloomily back and
forth across my study when we returned
a worried look in his blue eyes a wor-
ried frown between his brows his hands
sunk elbow-deep in his trousers pockets

de succes inspector renouard burst into
the room his dark eyes fairly blazing
with excitement his beard and mustaches
bristling electrically all the way from
the prefecture i have run-as fast as a
taximeter could carry me behold we
have found him those peerless realtors
sullivan dorsch  doerr have but
recently rented a mansion to one chinese
gentleman a fine large furnished house
with commodious garage attached he
particularly desired a garage as he pos-
sessed an automobile of noble size in
which he drove to the house agents office
accompanied by a chauffeur and footman
also orientals yes of course the gen-
tlemen of real estate noticed this par-
ticularly since such customers are of the
rarest at their office in lieu of references
he paid them three months rent in cash
-in golden louis-no what is it the
american gold coin is called bucks
yes in golden bucks he paid one thou-
sand berries-the gendarme at headquar-
ters told me

  how much in dollars is a thousand
berries my friend he turned bright in-
quiring eyes upon costello

  tell wid stoppin to translate now
lets git busy an find him costello
roared are ye wid me doaor de
grandin sor

  cordieu when was i ever otherwise
in such a case mon vieux the little
frenchman answered in a perfect fever of

excitement quick make haste my
friend

  of renouard he asked and where
may one find this so superbly furnished
house and garage the oriental gentleman
rented petit frere

  at  hamilton avenue of the
west the other returned consulting his
black-leather pocketbook where is
friend costello he has not yet com-
puted the berries into dollars for me

  sergeant costello had no time to ex-
plain the vagaries of american slang to
the excited inspector with tght-lipped
mouth pressed close to the transmitter of
my office telephone he was giving direc-
tions to some one at police headquarters
in a low and ominously calm voice
yeah he murmured tear-bombs
thats what i said an a couple o chop-
pers an some fire-axes an riot guns an
every man wid his nightstick git me
o k be round here pronto an if anny
one rings th bell or sounds th siren on
th way ill beat im soft wid me own two
fists git that too come on now shake
a leg im waitin but i aint waitin long
see

the early december dark had de-
scended though the moon was not
yet high enough to illuminate the streets
as the police car set out for hamilton
avenue obedient to costellos fiercely
whispered injunction gong and siren
were silent and we slipped through the
dusk as silently as a wraith

  the house we sought stood well back
on a quarter-acre plot of land planted
with blue spruce japanese maples and
rhododendron as far as we could see
the place was deserted for no gleam of
light showed anywhere and an at-
mosphere of that utterly dead silence
which seems the peculiar property of ten-
antless buildings wrapped it like a
blanket

 brought the car to a halt half-way down

   from a shoulder-holster slung beneath
 his left armpit inspector renouard drew
 a french-army revolver almost as large as
 a field gun and spun its cylinder apprais-

 little submachine-guns fell in on either

weird tales

door this is better i think he felt
quickly in his pocket producing a ring
on which half a dozen keys dangled and
sinking to his knees began trying first one
then another in the door the first three
trials were failures but the fourth key
sprung the lock and with a muttered ex-
clamation of satisfaction he swung back
the door and motioned us in

  bedad what an illigant burglar wuz
spoilt when you decided to go straight
costello commented admiringly as we
stepped across the threshold

  thick rugs ate up the sound of our
footfalls as we entered the darkened hall
and a blackness almost tangible sur-
rounded us while we paused to take our
bearings shall i give em a call the
sergeant whispered

  not at all de grandin denied if
we advertise our presence we have as-
suredly lost what advantage we have thus

far gained and-

  somewhere faint and far-away seem-
ing as though strained through several
tight-locked doors there came to us a
faint shrill eery note a piping quaver-
ing cry like the calling of a screech-owl
heard a long way off and answering it
subtly like an echo another wail

  howly mither whats that costello
asked which way did it come from
from under us i think de grandin
answered and it is devilment of the most
devilish sort my friend come let us
hasten there is no time to waste

  we tiptoed down the hall guided by
an occasional flash from costellos pocket
light crept softly through the kitchen
paused a moment at the basement door
to reassure ourselves we followed the
right track then swung the white-enam-
eled door back and passed quietly down
the stairs

  at the turn of the stairway we paused
fairly petrified by the scene below us

  draperies of heavy silk had been hung
at all the basement windows effectively
cutting off all telltale gleams of light to
the outside world a heavy chinese rug
gorgeous with tones of blue and gold
and deep rust-red was spread upon the
floor and at its four corners stood tall
vases with perforated tops through which
there slowly drifted writhing gray coils
of heavy incense robed in yellow a
parody of a man squatted cross-legged in
the center of the rug and it needed no
second glance to see he was terribly de-
formed one arm was a mere shriveled
relic of its former self one shoulder was
a full half-foot higher than the other his
spine was dreadfully contorted and his
round bullet-head thrust forward like
that of a vulture contemplating a feast of
carrion his cheeks were sunken eye-
sockets so depressed that they appeared
mere hollow caverns and the yellow skin
was drawn drum-tight over his skull so
that the lips were retracted from the un-
even discolored teeth studding his gums
a very deaths-head of a face i
thought

  but this bizarre uncanny figure squat-
ting between the incense pots was but a
stage-property of the show

  nude and fainting a young girl was
lashed face-forward to a pillar in the
floor her feet were raised a foot or more
above the cement and round the pillar
and her ankles was passed turn after turn
of finely knit silken cord knotting her
immovably to the beam and forcing her
entire weight upon the thongs which bit
so cruelly into her white and shrinking
flesh her arms were drawn around the
post the wrists crossed and tied at the
farther side but this did little to relieve
the strain upon the cords encircling her
ankles

  as we came to pause at the turning of
the stairs a short and slender brown-
weird tales



skinned man clad in a sort of apron of
yellow silk but otherwise quite naked
stepped forward from the shadows raised
his right hand and swung a scourge of
plaited leather mercilessly dragging the
lash diagonally across the girls defense-
less back

  she screamed and trembled and drew
herself convulsively closer to the post to
which she was bound as though she
sought to gain protection from her tor-
mentor by forcing her body into the very
substance of the pillar

  and at her trembling scream the seated
monstrosity laughed silently and from
her other side another yellow-aproned
man stepped forth and struck her with a
leather lash and as she screamed again
a third attendant who squatted on the
floor lifted a reed flute to his lips and
with the cunning fidelity of a phonograph
mocked her agonized cry with a trilling
quavering note

  as such things will flash through the
mind unbidden in times of stress i could
not help comparing her despairing cry
and the mockery of the flute to that com-
position called le roitelet in which a
coloratura soprano sings a series of runs
trills and diversions while a flute ac-
companiment blends so perfectly with
the voice that the listener can hardly say
which is human note and which the note
of woodwind instrument

  but my random thought was quickly
dissipated by de grandins sharp whisper
to renouard the one at the right for
you the other one for me my friend

their weapons spoke in unison and
once again the noises harmonized
for the deep roar of renouards revolver
was complemented by the spiteful whip-
like crack of de grandins automatic as
a tenor complements a bass and the two
whip-wielding torturers pitched forward
on the gorgeous rug as though an un-

seen giant had pushed them from behind

  the flutist half rose from his seat on
the floor but crumpled impotently in the
grasp of one of the policemen while in-
spector renouard fairly hurled himself
upon the deformed man and bore him
backward

  ah-ha you pig-swine i have you
now he cried exultantly you would
kill my men and mock the laws of france
and run off to the temple and think you
hid successfully from me you would
follow those escaping lovers to america
and put snakes and spiders where they
could bite me to death hein you would
torture this poor one here until she
screamed for mercy while your so detest-
able musician made mockery of her suffer-
ing very well you have had your
laugh now comes mine parbleu i think
my laugh is best	

  he rose dragging the other with him
and we saw the gleam of steel upon the
cripples wrists sun ah poy he an-
nounced formally i arrest you for wilful
murder for sedition and subornation of
sedition and for stirring up rebellion
against the republic of france

  he is your prisoner sergeant he
added to costello look well to him
and on tomorrow morning i shall begin
the extradition proceedings

  costello nodded curtly take em out
hornsby he ordered with a gesture
toward sun and the other prisoner tell
sullivan an esposito to ring for th van
an run em down to headquarters an call
th other boys in were goin through
this joint he motioned to the other
patrolmen to precede him up the stairs
then turned to us annything i can do
gentlemen he asked and i realized the
innate delicacy of the man as i noticed
how he conscientiously kept his glance
averted from the nude limp form which
de grandin cut down from the pillar of
torture

  i think not the little frenchman
answered looking up from his task with
a quick friendly smile we will join
you upstairs anon mon brave

  together we bent above the uncon-
scious girl her white back showed a
lattice-work of crossed whip-welts and in
several places the skin had ruptured let-
ting out the blood where the lash-marks
crossed at de grandins mute command
i gathered her in my arms and bore her
up the stairs to a bedroom laid her
under the covers then went to help him
search the bathroom for boric acid it is
not much use he admitted as we ap-
plied the powder to her ugly-looking
bruises but it must do till we can secure
opium wash at your house my friend
headed by costello and renouard the
police searched the house from founda-
tion to ridgepole but no sign of other
occupants could be found and the ser-
geant went to the telephone to tell the
city morgue of the bodies lying in the
basement will ye be afther cornin
along now sors he asked halting in the
doorway to the room where we treated
avis brindells hurts

  but certainly de grandin agreed
taking a blanket from the bed and wrap-
ping the girl in it will you set us down
at doaor trowbridges please we
must give this poor one further atten-
tion

with the girls injured back well
rubbed with soothing medicine
and carefully bandaged a powerful
hypnotic administered to assure her sev-
eral hours restful sleep de grandin and
i joined costello and renouard in the
study

  she will do nicely he pronounced
by tomorrow morning the hurt will have
vanished from her bruises christmas
night she will assuredly be able to attend
her sisters dinner party though it will be
weird tales



some time before she may again wear
decollete gowns without some slight em-
barrassment however-he raised eye-
brows and shoulders in an expressive
shrug-things might have been much
worse nest-ce-pas

  sergeant mon brave camarade-he
looked affectionately at costello - i
would suggest you telephone monsieur
and madame mcdougal and tell them
the lost lady has been found

  he helped himself to a cigar and
smoked in thoughtful silence while the
big irishman went to make his report

  she much resembles her so charming
sister this madame avis does she not
he asked apropos of nothing as detective
sergeant costello rejoined us

  yes i agreed the resemblance is re-
markable indeed i never recall seeing
three women looking more alike

than-

  precisement he interrupted it is
there the explanation lies

  when first the possibilities of this
case appealed to me was when inspecteur
renouard told madame mcdougal that
this thi-bah the missing temple-dancer
resembled her he added

  remember friend trowbridge ma-
dames nerves were all on edge last
night because a strange man a skull-
faced oriental had accosted her in the
streets of harrisonville that are out-
rageous i told me but i thought no
more about it until the good renouard
pops up like a jack-in-the-box from
cambodia and tells us this story of the
runaways from the angkor temple when
he informs madame mcdougal that the
missing thi-bah resembles her something
goes click in this so clever brain of mine
-i begin to foresee complications i also
damn suspect why this oriental with a
face like a skeletons has taken special
note of a strange lady in an american

weird tales

  now as you know i too have so-
journed in cambodia the secrets of that
land are not strange to me by no means
of the ways of her people i have in-
quired deeply and this i have learned
should a slave run off from those who
own him or a lady leave her lawful
wedded spouse or the man who claims
her without the benefit of clergy for that
matter the deserted one will seek to find
the fugitive but if he can not do so he
will resort to sympathetic magic to com-
pel the runaways return

  you know how in the ancient days
and more recent times too the wizards
and the witches were wont to make a
waxen image of one whom they desired
to be rid of then place the figurine before
the fire so it would slowly melt and as it
melted the original would slowly pine
away and die of course occasionally
they would vary their technique by
thrusting pins through the image in a
vital spot and as they did so the poor
unfortunate whose effigy the image was
was seized with insupportable pains in
the same region as that through which
the pin was thrust

  it does sound childish i admit he
told us with a smile but magic is a most
real thing especially if it be believed in
and there is quite reliable evidence that
deaths have actually been caused thus

  now the cambodians have a some-
what similar practise though it entails
double suffering they procure some
person who bears a real or fancied re-
semblance to the runaway and thereupon
they treat him most discourteously some-
times they beat the substitute-that is the
usual manner of beginning if that mild
treatment fails they progress to branding
with white-hot irons to cutting off fingers
and toes hands and feet ears nose
breasts and tongue with dull knives
then comes the interesting process of
gouging out the eyes with iron hooks

finally complete evisceration while the
unfortunate one still lives and breathes

  preposterous not necessarily i my-
self have seen cambodians hands wither
as though with leprosy for no apparent
reason i have seen feet become useless
and seen eyes grow dim and blind i
sought to find some medical explanation
and was told there was none it was sim-
ply that some enemy was working sym-
pathetic magic somewhere at a place
unknown and somewhere another poor
unfortunate was undergoing excruciating
torture that the hated one might also
suffer

  remember my friends the cambod-
ians believe this to be possible believe it
implicitly that makes a world of differ-
ence so it was with thi-bah she who is
now madame hildebrand for all of her
short life she had been subject to those
monkey-faced priests she was taught to
believe in their fell powers that they
might not be able to do all they claimed
had never once been entertained in her
thought undoubtlessly she had seen such
cases in the past had seen unfortunate
women tortured that some fugitive might
suffer had seen other unfortunates grow
crippled despair and die because some-
where an enemy worked magic on them

  when we heard mademoiselle avis
had been kidnapped and that she was
madame mcdougals sister the reason
for the crime at once leaped to my eye
that she bore family resemblance to her 
sister who had been said to much re-
semble thi-bah i made no doubt what
the so amiable doctor sun would do in
the circumstances i also could assume
without great trouble therefore we set
about finding him and finding him in
haste lest harm befall his unfortunate in-
voluntary guest

  i was on the point of asking friend
trowbridge to accompany me to mon-
weird tales



sieur hildebrands to interview his bride
when the young man saved me the trouble
by appearing so opportunely alors to
his house we went there we beheld his
young and pretty wife and saw the whip-
scars take form upon her back even as we
looked these scars were pyschic force
physically manifested of course but they
were none die less painful for that reason
also mademoiselle brindell who served
as substitute for her whom doctor sun
would have liked to torment in person
was no less tortured because she suffered
through no fault of hers there is the
answer and die explanation my friends

  but- i began

  excusez-moi he broke in i must
inquire after madame hildebrand

  and she rests easily he asked when
his connection had been made and archy
had reported favorably tres bien-ha
do you tell me so excellent monsieur
i am most happy

  monsieur archy reports he told us
as he replaced the receiver in the hook
that madame his wife not only rests
easily but that the whip-marks have
almost entirely disappeared a miraculous-
ly quick cure for bruises such as we
observed this afternoon nest-ce-pas
friend trowbridge

  it certainly is i agreed but-

  and the day after tomorrow we dine
with monsieur and madame mcdougal
and the so charming mademoiselle avis
he interrupted sergeant you must go
too the party would be dismal without
you me i devoutly hope they have pro-
cured a turkey of noble proportions at
present i could eat one as great as an
elephant

quick elfin smiles sergeant friend
