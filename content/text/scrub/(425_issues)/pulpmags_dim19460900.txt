for two days and nights a pair of scot-
land yards ace detectives had been
staked out in that room in a luxurious
west end london apartment their eyes
were glued to a peep-hole in the floor and
they were watching and recording every mo-
tion of the attractive girl in the apartment
below headquarters had detailed them to the
job after having received a mysterious yet
seemingly authentic tip that the womans
life was in danger

  the lonely seemingly thankless vigil con-
tinued until they heard a door spring open
followed the angry cry of a mans voice to
the detectives consternation the man never
once stepped into the field of vision of the
peep-hole and then to their complete bewil-
derment the girl also stepped out of sight

  suddenly they heard a shrill scream closely
followed by a shot racing down the stairs
they broke into the apartment to find the
woman murdered and the man completely
vanished without an apparent trace

  the eerie quality of this case came to mind
today when we read cyril plunketts new
novelette terror on twelfth lets see if
you agree

  jean kirkwood a serious blue-eyed ex-
fashion model found herself peering through
a haze of uncertainty into the life of her hand-
some young husband bert kirkwood upon
him fortune had smiled he was gay hand-
some-and highly successful

  but who was he who were his friends
what had he done before they had met during
the war and were married after a whirlwind
romance the answers to these questions
like the identity of ahe strange killer in the


london apartment were outside jeans field
of vision

  then suddenly-again like the shot which
the detectives heard-a shred of the answer
came to her in a mysterious sinister phone
call when a froggy voice croaked over the
wire you wouldnt want your husband sent
to prison lady would you that was all
but the terrifying calls kept coming day
after day  

    did you think it over

    who are you she whispered

    he laughed wait a minute mrs kirk-
 wood this is business im in business
and business can be risky get it

     i dont know what youre talking about i
   you didnt tell your husband

    not-not yet she admitted

    okay you get in a cab and tell the
  driver ilonnys bar on twelfth hell
  know where it is you look in the last
  booth ill be waiting mike you say
  and ill say hello mrs kirkwood then
  well know were on the right track and
  well sit down and talk business you bring
  -oh say couple hundred as a retainer
  she had just two hours her whole life
  and berts-yes the little fellows too-
  was to be decided in  minutes two
  hundred dollars that in itself was noth-
  ing it was what would come next   

    honnys said the cab driver his
  card read john j mudge he was young
  and brown and brawny then he grinned
  you sure youve got that right miss
  its a dump miss

continued from page 

    her voice caught yes im afraid so
still he watched her in the mirror
 youll want me to wait miss

    suddenly she liked his face there in the
  mirror yes ill be out in fifteen min-
  utes

    so she went to keep her appointment
  with mike  it was a bizarre rendezvous
  she found for when she arrived mike was
  a corpse 

  after that her mind was a little hazy
honny ed soo lux-all men from the bar-
the taxi driver and the wild procession of ex-

plosive events whirled and kaleidoscoped
through her frightened mind but even so
there remained the deep inner urgency to look
behind the dark curtain which separated her
from bert

  then crouched in the rear of the black-
mailers car things were becoming only too
clear   

  she cringed in the farther corner on the
floor soos hand grabbed her held her by
the neck then the car door opened-and
closed honny was inside now soo was still
there in his corner and    mike lay on
the floor shed met him at last introduced by
death his body pressed against her and she
shuddered 

    honny said wheres the blanket

    ed had the blanket ed stuck his face in
  the door he said to honny heres to a
  nice trip kid

    get the joint open ed everything the
  way it should be get a couple of the boys
  down here in case the cops show up to-
  morrow you know-we were upstairs all
  evening playing poker

    honny pulled the car door shut then he
  said all right mrs k you can have a

  rough out or a smooth one you know i
  play for kfceps you know i dont argue-
  you saw what happened to mike okay i
  want to know what the pitch was with
  mike

   lux was crawling in behind the wheel
 lux turned looked across the seat at them
 soo and honny sat there

   come on mrs k honny said his
 voice sharper we havent got all night
 mike called you this afternoon that
 right -

    she murmured a faint yes

    but are you sure he didnt contact your
  husband

   yes or no by which would she now
 gain an advantage before she could de-
 cide though honny said i get it he
 didnt mike said he didnt and i guess it
 checks i dont get his angle how come
 he buzzed you where do you stand on
 leslie

   leslie her mind began whirling fas-
 ter the merry-go-round to spin faster
 leslie was that name a brass ring that
 somehow she must reach out and grab
 quickly a ring to save her-or bring her
 death 

    then honny snarled savagely come on
  mrs k leslie-the guy who was mur-
  dered

  for a moment her heart ceased to beat all
the long long day she had tried to feel berts
past she had wondered if it had been a
stolen car some escapade way back in berts
youth shed wondered if hed held a job of
some importance somewhere once and stolen
money she knew she should have made bert
open the book before their marriage didnt a
girl knarry more than a man didnt she
marry his past too but shed loved bert
and to love him was to trust him shed never
even in her wildest fancies conceived that in
his past there might be a murder

 thats what we mean by eerie thats
the way terror on twelfth grips you as
you race through its pages to find out what
dark secret actually had happened to bert
which would bring himself his lovely wife
and child into the grim shadow of lurking
death

  the story will appear in the next issue of
dime mystery magazine and we feel that it
will bring the readers as it did to us a spine-
chilling sense of impending menace tense
drama and convincing human color

pelling novelettes and short stories in the

 murder  w t ballard

mystery novel of the year

chapter one

home of the dead

did you ever go on a treasure hunt i
dont mean the game which is some-
thing like a paper chase i mean the
real thing

  i did i thought i was too smart for any-
thing like that but everyone has a wgak point
i guess mine was a blonde i cant explain
ever getting mixed up in the foolishness any
other way

   it all started when malcom ramus sent for
me ramus didnt look like a professor he
looked like a snow bird he was a little guy
with a pointed nose and brown eyes which
stood out from his face like two half-buried
marbles

   his office was one flight up in an old ram-
shackle building on rampart a couple of blocks
off canal the black letters on the glass panel
of the door read information on anything
m ramus a very modest guy the professor

   he always gave me a laugh maybe thats
 why i kept up a contact with him he knew

ii


w t ballard

the town like the back of his hand and all
about the people in it both living and dead

  what he didnt know he could find in his
books the books occupied the room at the
rear and they nearly filled it piled in huge
stacks which reached almost to the dirty ceil-
ing there must have been six or seven thou-
sand but ramus could find the one he wanted
within a couple of minutes he must have
had a card index in his head

  his income wasnt very good or very cer-
tain the library called him occasionally
the university asked him questions and he
lectured once in awhile sometimes he bor-
rowed money from me i suspected that he
wished to borrow some on the afternoon he
phoned but i was wrong he wanted me to
meet a girl

  the girl gave me butterflies she was so
blonde that her hair looked almost white in
the ray of afternoon sun which crept in
through ramus dusty windows her eyes
were blue and very dark her lashes dark too
and it made a startling effect

  she wore a shark-skin suit and she was the
kind of person who could wear tailored clothes
and still look very very like a woman

  i caught my breath i like pretty women
who doesnt

  ramus said this is van kerby the best
detective in north america

the world i told her playing it straight
this is sue pedarre the little professor
looked at her as if shed been made of rare
porcelain and this is her attorney boyd
henderson

  henderson shook hands he was big fifty
perhaps a well conditioned fifty which spoke
of plenty of golf or maybe hand ball

  ive heard of you he said

  i let that pass a lot of people had heard
of kerby and smith we pride ourselves that
we have the biggest agency in the south

  what gives i was watching the girl i
liked watching her i thought i could sit
there for a long long time just looking

  ramus said miss pedarre belongs to one
of the old families however she wasnt born
here but in california

  i looked at the girl the name was certainly
french but that blondness they raise them
nice in california i said

  ramus ignored me the girl tried to the
lawyer cleared his throat

  one of her ancestors said ramus was
a smuggler or a trader-a pirate perhaps
his name was henri henri pedarre he is
supposed to have financed some of the lafitte
operations although ive never been able to
connect him directly with the brothers

  i waved this aside i wasnt concerned with
history well

  at any rate he was killed in the battle of

new orleans before he died he told his
wife that hed buried a fortune she never
found it although she spent her life looking
her sons never found it the story of the
treasure became a legend in the family

  so now miss pedarre is hunting the treas-
ure i started to reach for my hat which
id placed on the floor beside my chair well
i wish her luck

  wait said ramus and there was an
urgency in his voice she found a chart it
was in an old trunk lid its evidently been
there since henri pedarre hid it after burying
his gold he reached into his desk drew out
a piece of parchment and handed it to me

  i took it unwillingly almost every old
property in the state has its own story of
buried treasure some of them may be true
the fact remains that not many have been
found

  i looked at the chart it seemed to be the
plan of a house or of a number of plantation
buildings below the plan were three columns
of numbers and to the right was a silly jingle

    start at the center and turn to the right

     from y to a and v to d

    the bishops longest move you see

      dropping squares at bottom and right

    and using only those which are white

      you have no place for the letter z

t read it over twice then shook my head
passing it back sorry im not good at
puzzles

  ramus said you dont understand i
didnt send for you to solve this ive already
solved it

  you have i looked at him completely
startled

  and a very simple matter he wasnt
bragging merely stating a fact it only took
me two hours you see anyone familiar with
chess would spot it at once

  whats chess got to do with it

  the bishop he explained is one of the
pieces used in a chess game he moves di-
agonally across the board therefore the
bishops longest move would be from the upper
left hand corner of the board perhaps to the
right lower

  he opened his desk again and produced a
chess board you see he drew a line with
his finger

go on i didnt see but i was listening
all right now half the board squares
are white half black the rhyme says to use
only the white squares and also to ignore the
bottom row and the row to the right

  now when a chess board is correctly
placed so he turned the board a is in the
upper white corner y at the other end of
the diagonal if we ignore the row at the bot-
dig your own murder



tom and right thus he arranged the letters
hurriedly

  you see

  i stared at the board okay if you say
so what now

  these columns of numbers he explained
take the first number  you notice that
in  place does a one appear therefore i
figured that they began counting with one
now your rhyme the first line is start
from the center and turn to your right i
started in the center of the board first it didnt
work i then started in the center of the first

line try it counting the square between b
and c as one it will come out d i wont
bore you with working out each number the
cipher reads

      dig ten paces from the post
      where the whip is used the most

i stared doubtfully at the columns of figures
all right if you say so but if youve
solved the cipher what do you need with me
the lawyer interrupted frankly mr
kerby were scared

i turned to look at him he didnt seem
scared nor was he the type of guy who id
expect to scare easily scared of what
he shook his head we dont know miss
pedarres luggage has been searched twice
since her arrival and shes been followed
i grinned at the girl i can think of sev-
eral reasons why she should be followed that
have nothing to do with buried treasure
she flushed the color coming up into her
face the lawyer made a noise in his throat
it was obvious that he did not appreciate
my little joke

  ramus said hurriedly its simple van
miss pedarre wants to hire you shes afraid
that if she goes out to dig up the treasure
someone will hi-jack it before she gets back

  i shrugged ill send an operative it will
cost you twenty-five dollars and expenses
the girl spoke up almost for the first time
her voice was low yet warm and -throaty
wouldnt you go yourself id feel much
safer

  i looked at her when does this digging

take place

  tonight

  you and his nibs i nodded toward the
lawyer

  i cant go he said ive got an important
meeting if i could i wouldnt need you
our eyes measured each other i thought
im pretty much in my own line but to this
bird im just another hired man hes not
going to like me with his blonde girl but he
cant help himself

  okay i said youre hired yourself a
digging man but just where do we dig that
rhyme isnt very clear

  in the old slave quarters said ramus
where else do you think they used a whip
around there

  we drove out the old river road i know
that country pretty well and im familiar with
the old plantations once it was a place of
beauty of life but that was some time back
most of the old houses have boards at their
windows now and the land has gone back
neglected and uncared for

  it wasnt really worried about the girl being
followed ive found that treasure seekers are
usually given to screwy ideas

  but i didnt say that as we drove along
the sweeping road how long since youve
seen the place i asked

cue pedarre shook her head ive
 never seen it i inherited it from an uncle
a couple of years ago mr henderson came
down once to look at it weve been trying
to sell but we havent found a buyer

  a lot of the old places are for sale and a
lot of them have failed to find buyers the
country isnt what it once was its kind of
empty now a little desolute its productivity
mostly gone

  howd you happen to find the cipher
she smiled that was an accident when
mr henderson was down here he sold the
old furniture but he shipped several old
trunks up san francisco i didnt want them
so we decided the best thing to do was to
burn them the cipher was hidden in one of
the lids

  henderson there when you found it
  she nodded

  he seems to be around most of the time
  hes an old family friend she said

  i tried to make something of that i had
directions from ramus how to find the place
hed even told me how to park theres an

i		- i i   	-

old lane he said you can pull into that
and walk across the field to the slave quar-
ters that way anyone following you wont
see the car

  id laughed the idea of anyone actually
following us had struck me as funny but i
did watch the rear view mirror all the way
from town i was certain we hadnt been fol-
lowed

  i parked the car in the lane and took up
the pick and shovel id brought the whole
setup made me feel ridiculous but the blonde
being with me made it fun we started across
the field toward where the old house made a
dark outline against the sky

  nothing bothers me usually but as we
walked across the rough ground i had the
sensation of ants crawling up and down my
back maybe it was the girls excfltement for
she was nervous

  the hand resting on my arm pressed hard
enough so that they should have been able
to take her finger prints off my hide

  relax i said im going to have to use
that arm to dig with

  instead of relaxing her grip tightened and
her voice had the breathless dry quality which
can be put there only by fear

  look

  i turned to look at first i saw nothing to
cause her excitement then i saw the dark
outline of a car parked in the shadow of the
trees

  someones here she whispered some-
one is after the treasure

  probably neckers

  i placed the shovel and pick on the ground
just some kids making woo wait here until
i see

  i moved forward then loosening the gun
under my arm i was nervous and getting
more so for as i crossed the drive leading
back to the old house i realized that it had
been used recently used quite a lot for a
supposedly deserted place

  i had the gun free i felt better with its
solidness in my hand a nice gun a thirty-
eight on a forty-five frame with the grip
specially built to fit my hand then i edged
onward listening for voices there were none
the car was empty

  i looked it over with care nothing re-
markable a cheap sedan five years old on
second thought i jotted down the license num-
ber then i moved back to the girl

  no one there i was whispering but
the car hasnt been parked long the grounds
damp and the mud on the tires still fresh

  some ones after the treasure

  l-ook kitten i said lets pretend were
grown up huh this treasure business is
okay for kids and i didnt mind driving out
here with you to look for it but how could

anyone else know about it or your silly cipher
or anything unless you talked

  but the cars here

   it was there all right i couldnt deny that
all right i said someones trespassing
you stay here and ill look around i turned
and moved toward the dark outline of the
deserted house i didnt know she was fol-
lowing until i felt her breath against the side
of my face i almost shot her i was that
jumpy

  hey i said dont you ever do what
youre told

  i was scared she whispered i didnt
want to be left alone

  i hesitated the smart thing was to take
her back to my car but nothing moved in
the dark overgrown yard ahead i was prob-
ably being silly

  come on then but keep quiet

  i moved around to one side of the old
house it was in pretty sorry shape once
it had been quite a place but now the windows
were covered with rough boards the white
lead of the paint was peeling away from the
walls

  i was busy looking at the house but the
girl hadnt forgotten the rhyme

       dig ten paces from the post
       where the whip is used the most

  that could only mean the old slave quar-
ters again she caught my arm with fingers
which dug into the flesh look

chapter two

dollars or the dame

t looked toward the row of old buildings
at the rear and suddenly i stiffened it was
faint but very distinct in the darkness the
finger of light which crept out through the
chink in the old walls

  i started to tell her to remain where she
was then i knew it was no use so i merely
whispered quiet now and moved ahead
my gun held ready

  the buildings didnt seem to be in as bad
shape as the main house i guessed they had
been used to quarter some of the field hands
and therefore had been kept in repair

  the light was coming through a crack in
the old stone foundation and i got down on
my knees to peer through i had a restricted
look at a stone paved room lighted by a
flickering candle i guessed that the room
had once served as the plantation prison for
i could see two pair of rusty chains hanging
from the far wall

  this then would be the place where unruly
slaves had felt the biting lash of the whip i
dig your own murder



own that i was suddenly quite tense the
rhyme was working out ten paces from
where those chains hung was the place to
dig only someone was there before us some-
one must have dug or be planning to dig

  there were two men in the room i couldnt
see their faces but i heard one say all
right then thats the deal you handle that
much and come back tuesday

 the second man was uneasy you could
feel it i   well  

  youll come back his companion laughed
youre in this now brother how would
you like a tip to the bank examiners

  i didnt catch the muttered answer he
turned and moved to the ladder-like stairs
the last i saw was his legs climbing upward
 i heard him step outside i heard his
feet move across the stone entrance i thought
he muttered to someone but i couldnt be
sure he might have been talking to himself
i waited listening for other sound it came
finally the roar as he started the car

  i told the girl to wait and moved around to
the building entrance keeping well in the
shadow of the wall just in case there was an
outside guard i saw no one and the girl
was right behind me

w t ballard

  i stepped into the building guided by the
light which came up the stairway and moved
down them cautiously one hand on the rough
cut stone of the wall the other holding the
gun moisture came through the wall making
the stone wet and a little slippery

  the man was busy in a far corner hed
raised one of the floor stones and pulled out
a metal box in spite of myself my pulse
leaped

  as i watched he raised the box lid seemed
to place something inside and started to close
the lid

  hold it i said and gained the floor level
in three quick steps

  he swung around it was the first knowl-
edge he had that he was not alone his hair
showing beneath the edge of the low drawn
hat was very black his eyes matched the
hair glittering a little in the candle light
his hand moved as if by reflex toward the
gun clip beneath his arm

  hold it i jerked my gun a little and he
stopped standing half crouched

  what is this a hi-jack youll get killed
for this mac

  if anyone gets killed it will be you get
away from that box over by the wall on
the double

  he obeyed sullenly and i ordered him to
turn around facing the wall

  again he obeyed and i was just reaching
for the gun in his shoulder clip when he
kicked backwards

  i was ready for that too my gun was
high i stepped sideways and slashed it against
his head he crumpled without a sound i
stooped got his gun and slid it into my pocket
he was out cold

  the girl uttered a little half smothered
gasp she stood for a long moment staring
down at the man is he    dead

  i shook my head take a look at your
treasure kitten i indicated the metal box
with a jerk of my gun

  she stared for an instant longer then
moved over to the box and looked down at
its contents

  its    its full of money    there was
a treasure  i didnt really believe it she
had dropped to her knees beside the small box
and was hauling forth bank notes

  i moved over to her side there was a
treasure all right but no pirate had buried
it the box had told me that it was new of
light metal like a dispatch box i reached
down and looked at the bills they were
signed by henry morgenthau

  it hurt me to tell her she was like a kid
with a new toy she hadnt really looked at
the money it didnt dawn on her that they
hadnt printed bills like that in eighteen-
twelve

  i said its money all right kitten but im
afraid that you wont get to keep it

che looked up and her eyes fastened on the
 gun which i still held loosely her blue
eyes seemed to crystallize into chips of ice and
her shoulders stiffened you    you mean
youre going to take it to rob me

  i shrugged after all you couldnt blame
her it was a natural reaction shed seen
me club the punk and it must have seemed
pretty ruthless who was i a private de-
tective out for what i could get

  i grinned look sweet those are nice
thousand dollar bills its hard to spend thou-
sand dollar bills right now the banks make
you register when you bring one in the
fbi asks strange questions

  but why

  dont you read the papers didnt you
ever hear of black market money

  i could see she had she looked down at
the bundles of money shed gathered up and
gradually she let them slide back into the
box then    then there isnt any treas-
ure

  i shrugged if there is this isnt the time
to hunt for it sonny boy over there i in-
dicated the unconscious man may have some
friends around i cant imagine them being
this careless weve got to move easy weve
got to be certain we take no more chances
than we need to here you pick up the box
it isnt heavy you can have the fun of carry-
ing it back to the car

  she closed the box slowly what about
him

  i hesitated then i went over and went
through his pockets there was nothing at
all in the way of identity i thought of tying
him up until the authorities could get there
a sound from outside decided me against it
the sound had been a step

  i covered the distance to the candle in two
jumps and blew it out then i whispered to
the girl over this way

  her soles scraped on the stone floor in the
darkness i didnt like it that cellar was a
trap whoever was outside would notice the
light off in a minute if he were a guard
hed be suspicious

  i guessed now that hed walked to the car
with the other man and was just coming back
up the stairs i whispered grasping her
arm

  she almost dropped the box yes she had
it you could trust that gal to freeze onto
money

  we moved quickly up the stairs i hoped
we could slip through the door unseen but
our luck was running thin we had no more
reached the open until a voice called
charley
dig your own murder



  maybe we should have stayed inside but
i dont like sweating things out id rather
have action than that yeah i grunted and
stepped into the open

  hey said the voice sounding surprised
youre not charley a gun lanced flame in
the darkness and the bullet struck the wall
close to my head

  i swung the girl around the corner the
gun hammered a second time blasting sharply
into the night i knew the guard couldnt see
us because of the angle from which his shots
came if the girl hadnt been with me i might
have circled back and tried to get him as it
was we ran there was a ditch a hundred
feet behind the buildings we dived for it

  i thought of snakes but at the moment i
was worried more about hot lead than about
venom we made the ditch and worked our
way along it the man back by the house was
still jumpy every couple of minutes hed
blast at something im not certain what he
thought he was shooting at maybe he was
just exercising histrigger finger

  but he wasnt following and i slowed the
pace the girl was panting and i took the
box from her relax kitten were out of
trouble now

   she gave a little gasping laugh im afraid
im not up to treasure hunting kerby i al-
most died when those bullets started flying

   we both almost died i said soberly for
shooting in the dark that bozo was coming
close

  she squeezed my arm youre nice she
said somehow i feel pretty safe when im
with you

  she was very close and very nice i had
the sudden impulse to kiss her instead i
squeezed her arm lets get back to the car
the sooner i get this mud off the better ill
feel

   we came out of the ditch cutting across the
field it was rough going and she almost fell
twice i was trying to help her i was care-
less i guess i never saw them until they
jumped us

  we were close to the car then they came
out of the hedge to the right the girl was
jerked away from me and someone swung at
my head

  i ducked rolling with the blow and went
down to one knee there was a culvert to
the right and i tossed the box into the ditch

  the man standing over me swung again at
my head i grabbed his knees and jerked his
feet out from under him he went down and
a second man swung at my head i rolled
away coming up to my feet jerkingjny gun
free

	i couldnt see the girl she seemed to have
vanished i heard a cars motor somewhere
on the road everyone was running and shout-

ing i ran to the right and suddenly stepped
off into a hole

  the water was up to my neck the brush
along the edge was so heavily matted that
i couldnt drag myself out i heard them
calling to each other i saw the wink of a
flash light and knew they were searching for
me

   i crowded close into the brush my nose just
above water they must have hunted for ten
minutes but they were worried about some-
thing finally the car lights cut on they
pulled up beside my coupe raised the hood and
did something to the motor then they drove
away

t was just about to haul myself out when
someone came running up the road i saw
a man move to my coupe examine it and
call something unintelligible a voice an-
swered they stayed there for perhaps five
minutes then they too disappeared

  i dragged myself out of the water i was
almost drowned i didnt know where the
girl was i didnt seem to know much of any-
thing somewhere in the mess id lost my gun
i went over to the culvert and found the box
it was awkward to carry i took out the
money and stuffed it into my pockets it would
get wet but that didnt bother me then i
went over to the car and tried to start it
it wouldnt run

	 

  i must have walked five miles there were
blisters on my heels from the wet shoes i
finally found a farmer who would take me to
town all he had was an old truck it was
four oclock when i got back to the apart-
ment the phone was ringing when i came in
through the door i had the feeling that it had
been ringing steadily for a long time i an-
swered it and a mans voice said

  weve got the girl well trade her for
the money

   just like that no hello no introduction i
took a long breath and told him youve got
the wrong number baby i dont know what
youre talking about

  the laugh was nasty and had no mirth
youll know when the cops fish the blonde
out of the river

  i hung up in a minute the phone rang
and i answered it look kerby said the
voice we traced the license plate of your
car even if the blonde hadnt talked wed
still know that youd been out at the pedarre
plantation tonight dont go to the fbi with
that dough not if you think anything of the
little girls life

  okay i said but youve got it wrong
mac i lost that dough in the fight i couldnt
find it so do what you like i hung up then


w t ballard

i was bluffing but i figured that the girl had
a better chance to live if they figured i had
nothing to trade for her

  i was so tired that i hardly knew what my
name was i had to do something but what
to do was the question then i thought of
the man whose car had been parked in the
plantation yard i didnt know what he looked
like or what his name was but i did know
his license number i reached for the phone
and called a friend in the motor vehicle
department

  the mans name was morse i got his
address on one of the side streets off canal
a couple of blocks short of louisiana he was
listed as a teller at one of the smaller banks

  i grinned at the information things seemed
to be making a little sense i cleaned up a
bit went down and took a cab over to the
address light was just beginning to show
in the eastern sky it would soon be morn-
ing

  the house was old like its neighbors set
back in a little square yard i had the cab
park at the corner and walked forward there
was no sign of life as i climbed to the porch
and rang the bell i rang it hard holding
the button down a long time finally an upper
window came open and a mans voice said
irritably

  whats the matter

  telegram i said knowing he couldnt
see me for the porch roof

  there was a mumble of conversation from
above then the window slammed and the
hall light came on i heard his feet on the
stairs heard him fumbling with the lock then
the door came open and he was staring at me

  youre not a messenger   he sensed
something wrong and tried to shut the door but
my foot was in the way and a second later my
gun was in my hand

  he was a small man with thin sandy hair
and tired squinty blue eyes the eyes got
wide at sight of the gun then filled with fear
what do you want

  i used the gun to back him into the hall i
want to talk to you morse

  he didnt like my use of his name he
didnt like anything about the setup he was
a little rat caught in a trap and looking des-
perately for a way out

  i fished out a card case with my free hand
i found a card which said that i represented
the bankers protective association which
was true enough since our office did some
work for them

he stared at the card with dilated eyes
his lips were suddenly dry and he circled
them with his tongue what do you want
you made a trip tonight i said you
saw a man about some thousand dollar bills
thats a lie

  dont get excited mac my voice was
hard fwas there i saw you

  you cant prove anything

  i grinned sourly thats what you think
that plantation yard was muddy your tires
left tracks maybe you dont know it but
the police can check those tracks against your
tires almost as easily as they can check a set
of finger prints

  the long skinny hands hanging out of his
pajama sleeves worked i could see him think-
ing wondering if he somehow could grab my
throat

   dont try it i said id have five bullets
in you before you touched me

chapter three

              r

too hot to handle

tje collapsed then he quit you can
tell when a man quits when hes no longer
dangerous and it isnt pretty to watch but i
had no feeling of mercy for him i was
thinking of the blonde girl

  he let his head hang and his voice was
no longer turbulent what are you going to
do with me

  that depends i said im not after you
oh sure i know the story you were short
in your accounts you saw a chance to buy up
enough black market thousand dollar bills for
maybe seven-fifty a bill to cover your short-
age im still not interested i want the men
you dealt with and if you help ill try and
put in a good word for you

  he groaned i was short in my accounts
i didnt know what to do i got a letter
through the mail it seemed like a form letter
it said that a company would make personal
loans up to twenty thousand dollars on char-
acter only and that my name had been sug-
gested as eligible for such a loan i knew
there was some catch there had to be but
i was desperate i didnt know which way to
turn so i called them up

  finally i met a man in a restaurant he
said frankly that it was black market money
he said he knew i was short in my accounts
or i wouldnt have answered the letter he
threatened to report me to the bank examiners
if i refused to deal

  what did this man look like

  morse hesitated but he was thoroughly
whipped the man was big he said in a
cracked voice he had black hair and a scar
on one side of his face the scar wasnt so
noticable except it lifted one side of his face
as if he were always smiling

  how big

  morse hesitated well over six feet six-
four or five perhaps

  i nodded it certainly wasnt the man id
ft	b 

dig yourown murder

struck down at the old plantation do you
imow how to get in touch with any of them

  he didnt he denied any further knowl-
edge and i believed him it seemed id ac-
zomplished absolutely nothing by my visit and
i said so as i walked to the door

  he stood there nervously you wont turn
me in

  i shrugged this will have to be straight-
ened out but  i never finished the sen-
tence a gun made a sharp sudden sound
an the still morning air

  it still wasnt light enough to see anything
t couldnt even be certain from which direc-
tion the shot had come i heard morse give
i kind of grunt then his body fell sideways
ilmost knocking me from my feet

  it probably saved my life for i went stag-
gering across the porch as the gun sounded
igain the bullet striking the house wall close
to the door jam

  i vaulted the porch rail and found shelter
behind a tree i heard the slap slap of feet
sn the turf i heard the sound of my cabs
motor flare suddenly heard the gears clash
evidently the driver was gun shy i turned
ind looked back at the house a woman was
in the house doorway kneeling beside the
fallen morse i heard her dry sobs then
she started to scream that was all i should
have stopped to call the cops i didnt i turned
and ran

  i had the feeling i was followed i couldnt
be sure i didnt actually see anyone i made
my way to the carline and rode back to my
apartment

  from there i called sue pedarres lawyer
he sounded sleepy but the sleep went out of
his voice at the news he started to swear
he kept swearing have you called the
cops

  i told him that i hadnt that i had no in-
tention of calling them until i knew more than
i did theyve got the girl i added as
long as they think theres any hope of trading
her for their black market money theres some



hope that she wont be harmed the best way
to sign her death warrant is to call copper
he agreed im sorry i ever let her into
this he said i never was too sold on the
treasure idea but its certainly unlucky that
this gang chose the old house to hide their hot
money in

  i agreed

  ill help in any way i can i feel terrible
why sue is almost like my own daughter
i love that girl

  anybody could love her i said and rang
off i didnt go directly to my office i went
to see ramus first

  i found the little professor behind his big
desk pouring over an old manuscript he
looked up eagerly as i came in you found
it i was right he jumped up from behind
the desk

  we found something i said and told
him what had happened

  his dark eyes got very wide his voice
dropped to an excited whisper this is ter-
rible a girl kidnapped a man dead where
will it end

  i shrugged look ramus theres some-
thing screwy about this deal it might be an
accident that these black market boys chose
the old house as a distribution headquarters
where they could sell their hot dough at re-
duced rates but the fact that it should be
in the same old prison room where the pe-
darre treasure is supposed to be buried is
really something

  the treasure is still there he was ex-
cited ill bet you the treasure is still there
you didnt follow the cipher did you you
didnt do any digging

  there was too much happening to do any
digging i said shortly i was too busy
worrying about getting out of there

  then its still there

  and as far as im concerned it can stay
there jntil i get the rest of this straightened
up tell me what do you know about this
lawyer henderson and the girl


w t ballard

he looked surprised what do you
mean

  exactly what i say what do you know
about him and the blonde

  well ramus settled back into his chair
not too much really hes an important
attorney in san francisco he has some local
connections and from time to time ive done
some research jobs for him why

  i shrugged i like to know who im doing
business with

  hes all right said ramus certainly
you dont think hes mixed up with the black
marketeers do you why if he was the last
thing in the world he could want would be to
direct you to the old pedarre place

  that makes sense

  and the girl did you ever see such a
sweet chick

  i looked at ramus hard i had no idea
that he had ever heard such a word the
little guy might have unknown possibilities
well what about her

  youre going to get her back certainly
shes worth more than all that hot money
in my book yes

  he relaxed im sorry i got you into this
van i never dreamed   

  forget it i told him everything always
happens to me this is no exception i
turned and left going back to my office

  the switchboard girl gave me some calls
most of them were from regular clients but
one was from a man named shawn

  i went into the office and looked up the
shawns in the phone book there were a lot
of them listed none with a number like the
one my man had left

  i tried the cris-cross with no better luck
i always like to know who a man is before
i talk to him but in this case no luck finally
i called mr shawn

  a mans voice answered and there was a
few minutes wait then another voice said
good afternoon mr kerby

  it was hardly noon but i let that pass
thank you very much for calling

  he had a nice polite sort of voice the kind
i associate with grey haired men tweedy
coats and briar pipes

  whats on your mind i wasnt im-
pressed by the voice ive been fooled too
often

  i understand youre a discreet man he
said and his tone turned buttery id like
to talk to you tonight about some money
which you have in your possession which
does not belong to you

  im a busy man i said my partner is
out of town and i havent much time to talk
this wont take time he assured me i
think we can work out a deal

  about the blonde

  he ignored this just a deal he said
you meet me tonight at eight and it woul
be wiser if you did not mention the meetin
to the police i have ways of learning things

   i wet my lips i havent talked to the cop
yet

  fine he said fine i think you an
i can do business big business he gave m
an address on royal you come alone h
added and ill be there otherwise you wil
find nothing nothing at all

  id hardly hung up the phone when thi
secretary buzzed the squawk box lieutenan
lemay wants to see you

  i told her to send him in i thought fas
during the couple of minutes it took him tc
walk from the reception room lemay was
assigned to homicide

  he came in small and dapper as always in
his double breasted blue suit with the ever
fresh flower in his button hole

  how are you van he had black eyes
and black hair he looked a lot more like
a gambler than a police officer

  i said i was fine and motioned him to a
chair he sat down on the edge and laced
his fingers over the head of the cane he al-
ways carried the fingers were encased in
pearl grey gloves quite a dresser lemay
and from all accounts quite a ladys man
what gives

  have you read the noon papers

   i hadnt and said so

but you might know that a man named
morse was shot to death about dawn this
morning a nice little harmless bank clerk
what make you think id know anything
about it

  he sighed he carefully removed one glove
produced a beaten silver case and extracted a
long russian cigarette with a false tip your
card was clutched in his hand lemay said
very careless van very careless indeed
there might have been a dozen reasons
why the guy could have my card

he admitted this by inclining his head
but also we found a cab driver a man who
hauled you from your apartment to morses
street when the shots came he took off
go on

  isnt that enough

  i know you i said you always hold
something back to club a man with id
rather have it now

tje sighed again then he blew smoke at
me in a perfect ring we found some
money in morses pockets thousand dollar
bills the wife broke down and talked her
husband was short in his accounts at the bank
hed been dealing with some gentlemen who
had thousand dollar bills for sale at reduced
rates black market money
dig your own murder



  so now im tied in with the black mar-
ket

  he shrugged im merely asking you what
you are tied up in we found a farmer who
drove a man to town this morning we also
located your car broken down on the old
river road

  thanks for telling me ive wondered
where it was i thought some of reporting it
stolen

  his black eyes gleamed what kind of
fire are you playing with now kerby

  i shrugged look lemay theres no
need telling you that i wont talk at the mo-
ment i cant youve known me for some time
you know that this office has always played
it straight across the board with the cops
sure he said sure i know but the
boys down at the hall dont all feel that way
i think youd better come down and talk to
them

  i went down and i talked they even
brought in the fbi because of the thousand
dollar bills ive sweated it out before when
a case of mine ran afoul of the cops but id
never gone through anything like that it was
after six before they finally turned me loose
i was surprised that they did they could
have held me as a material witness and id
have been forced to give bail i guess they
figured fhad too much at stake our office
was the biggest of its kind in the south

chapter four

the man who knew everything

rphe address on royal which mr shawn
had given me was an old house it dif-
fered not at all from the houses which flanked
it on either side id spent the better part
of an hour making certain that the cops
werent following me theyd tried but i still
knew a couple of tricks for getting rid of
unwanted trailers

  i judged that the house was at least a hun-
dred years old probably more and guessed
there was a court yard beyond the wall most
of the older houses had been built around
court yards

  i searched for the bell and found none an
old fashioned iron knocker made a heavy hol-
low sound as i dropped it

  somewhere in the neighborhood a dog
howled a cat was singing at the distant moon
and the rumble of traffic was a faint but steady
sound from the direction of canal

  nothing passed along the street no sound
came from within i had about decided that
mr shawn was playing games with me when
the door came open suddenly and the beam of
a hand torch was squirted directly into my
eyes

  what do you want the woman was very
old her voice was cracked and high and
accusing

  to see mr shawn i have an appoint-
ment the name is kerby

   whydidntyuhsayso she ran the words
together until it was a single mumbled syl-
lable she backed up taking the light out
of my eyes and i followed her stepping side-
ways so that she could close and chain the
heavy door

  she turned throwing the lights beam on
the stone-paved covered passageway which
led along one side of the courtyard

  i had a confused glimpse of  little pool
of heavy uncared for jungle like growth then
we reached the iron stairs which led upward
to the balcony

  the balcony served as an upper hall and
it was not in good repair it sagged and
groaned under our weight as we moved along
it to the door at the end

  the old woman was an uncertain shawl-
covered shape sinister in her silence like
some hooded spectre out of the middle ages
i had a feeling of unreality and the weight
of the gun beneath my arm gave little comfort

  she paused and knocked on the closed door
then turned and creaked her way back along
the way we had come taking the light with
her

  for a full minute the door remained closed
i almost called after my departing guide then
the strap hinges creaked and the door swung
back letting out light and the musty dusty
smell of age and damp and carelessness

  the man standing there was nothing like
the voice on the phone he was big he wore
chocolate slacks and a tan sport coat

  i raised my eyes and looked at his face im
tall but i had to look up to mr shawn he
was a good six feet four

  his face was as big as his body his hair
black rather thin and curly and he would
have been good looking save for the scar
which perpetually lifted the corner of his
mouth

  thank you for coming he said and i
jumped for it was the voice on the phone
also from morses description it was the man
of the black market money

  but the voice was no longer soft and friend-
ly it had a mocking hardness which rode
the words like a haunting overtone

  thats all right i said again conscious
of the bulk of the  beneath my arm it felt
good and reassuring

ome in he backed away and i had a
look at the bare room there were two
chairs nothing more evidently this room
was being used for this meeting only mr
shawn was apparently a cautious man


w t ballard

  i shut the door and moved toward one of
the chairs mr shawn took the other he
reversed it straddled the seat with his thick
legs and rested his big chin on knotted fore-
arms

  you dont look tough was what he said
i chuckled but not from amusement have
you been hearing rumors

  i made inquiries he admitted i like to
know what im up against when i sit in a
game it gives me some advantage 

  i can see your point i know nothing about
you

  you knew enough to hi-jack my money
how many men have you buried kerby

  i never bury them i toss the bodies in
the river what else did you learn

  that youre wise and smart that you and
your partner have a nice business here solid
accounts and connections which you wouldnt
care to lose

  thats right we get along

  then why monkey into my game his
tone had turned hard we want that money
back were willing to pay a reasonable
amount but no more than reason if you
dont deal well see that you are taken care
of frankly we dont like hi-j ackers

  what about the girl

  what girl you mean the one who was
with you we arent going to pay her off
separately if thats what youre getting at
you take care of her yourself

  i started to say something then changed
my mind instead i asked if i decide to
deal whats my cut

  ten thousand or if you want to throw
in with us use your connections to move
some of the hot money well pay you ten and
a percentage on everything you handle
that might be a possibility i appeared
to think it over

  shawn said wed rather do business with
you than fight you

  i nodded its always easier that way but
i dont want the same thing to happen to me
that happened to morse

  his eyes tightened a little at the corners
that would be unfortunate too bad that
morse got killed i didnt order that done
the boys were acting on their own they
figured morse had led you out to the old house
and that you went there to take over his cut
did he

  i passed over that one when do we make
the deal

  he was eager tonight

  i nodded okay tonight then i gave him
an address be there in two hours

  no crossing

  i shrugged how could i cross you with-
out losing out myself i rose and if you
try to cross me 

  he said we wont we can use a man
like-you kerby we need a local connec-
tion

	 

  when i got back to my apartment it was
a wreck someone had searched it thoroughly
and they hadnt been careful to put things
back where they belonged i stood in the
doorway for a long time looking at it then
i went over to the phone and called hender-
sons hotel

  his voice had an eager nervous note
whats happened

  i told him about the cops and then i told
him about mr shawn i said ive made a
deal i turn over the money and shawn turns
over the girl

  he was silent for a long moment youre
certain he has her

  who else someone surely does unless
shes hiding herself

  he agreed with that where are you
meeting shawn

  at ramus office i said i couldnt think
of any other place i didnt want to bring them
here or to my office

  are you going to tell the police

  and have them maybe kill the girl thats
foolish

  okay he said what do you want me
to do

  nothing if anything slips you can tell the
cops i was on the level trying i rang off
hurried down stairs and caught a cab to the
station id checked a package at the check-
room that morning the package held the hot
money then i caught another cab to ramus
office

  the little professor met me on the side-
walk he was almost hopping up and down
henderson called me he said he told
me what you were going to do you have no
right to use my office to get me mixed up in
this thing

  you got me mixed up in it i reminded
him

  he stared at me with round reproachful
eyes but thats your business im just a
quiet man

  gimme the keys i told him and go on
home if theres trouble blame me tell the
police you knew nothing about it

  he hesitated not knowing quite what to do
late evening traffic rolled by us in never end-
ing waves no one paid any attention

  make up your mind i said you can call
the police if you like but then if anything
happens to the blonde why then its all your
fault

  he made a little helpless gesture with his
hands here are the keys but dont let them
go into the library dont let them disturb
my books
dig your own murder



 t promised i went up the dirty stairs
  and unlocked the door then i put the
 package of money on the desk i was just
 headed for the library when a noise behind
 me made me turn mr shawm slipped into
 the room

  slipped is a strange word to use in connec-
 tion with such a big man but its the only one
 ivhich explains his movements i never saw
 inyone else so light-footed there was a gun
 n his big hand it looked small by compan-
 ion the hand almost smothered it

  i stared at the man at the gun whats the
 dea a double-cross 

  i havent made up my mind his eyes
 ook in the package of money on the desk and
 flowed for an instant you brought that
 byway

  what do you mean anyway i sounded
 ngry

  he said you were talking to some little
 erk down on the street he hurried away
 its his office i said he didnt like me
 ising it

 maybe said mr shawn he didnt like
 t so much that he was going for the police
 i didnt answer i wasnt surprised when
 man appeared shoving ramus small figure
 efore him

  we just dont take chances said shawn
 i shrugged okay you dont take chances
 heres your money lets deal

  you know he said giving me a slow
 tin there really isnt any reason why we
 hould deal with you as you say theres the
 joney all we have to do is to take it and
 ave

  i nodded thats right unless you want
 le to use my connections to help you change
 iiose thousand dollar bills into smaller money
 loney which wont be questioned

 he threw back his head and laughed i
 oled you on that one now didnt i you
  for it i sized you up i thought you would
 he question is now what is wisest to do
 meaning i was watching him closely

   he laughed again the rumbling sound which
 seemed to come from deep down in his big
 chest what was it you said earlier about
 throwing bodies into the river its a thought
 kerby do you realize that you and this little
 jerk he indicated ramus with a movement
 of his big thumb are the only ones who can
 tie me to this business

   sure i said thats what you think but
 wait a moment how do you think i happened
 to be at the plantation last night it wasnt
 an accident i assure you

   the other corner of his mouth lifted to
 match the one puckered by the scar you tell
 me mac

   i said ever hear of an attorney named
 henderson 

   his eyes came alive at the name what
 about him

   you have heard of him i see was he by
 any chance the reason you decided to use that
 plantation for your payoff point

   shawn was definitely interested now go
 on

   i said henderson sent me out there he
 sent me out on a trumped-up story of a treas-
 ure hunt i wasnt sold on it but there was a
 blonde involved and i was sold on the blonde
 a lot of smart men have done dumb things
 because of a girl

   why do you think i know henderson

   i shrugged im guessing but look at it
 this way i go out on a treasure hunt and find
 a box of hot money i dont believe in coin-
 cidences they happen sometimes but not
 often

   but why would henderson  

   i said i dont know what your deal with
 him was but i do know that he was in control
 of the plantation as miss pedarres agent he
 probably suggested it as a nice lonely place
 from which to operate

youre warm said shawn go on
and then he wanted the money for himself
he was afraid to tackle your men so he picked
a nice pigeon to do it he picked me because i

next time say

star

for a better

flashlight

and better

batteries


w t ballard

was supposed to be a tough guy he framed up
a cipher which sent me to the old slave prison
he even told me where to park my car like
a fool i played right into his hands i got
the dough just as he hoped i made a run for
the car taking the girl with me and he was
waiting there to jump me to grab the dough
well 

  but he didnt get the dough i managed
to slip out of his fingers so he held the girl
he called and offered to trade her for the
money when i talked with you on the phone

i thought you had kidnapped her but when
i talked to you tonight i realized that you
hadnt that you knew nothing about her be-
ing gone

  that meant there was someone else in the
game someone i hadnt been counting on it
must be henderson he was the only one who
knew i was connected with this thing except
for your men who apparently spotted me at
morses and followed when i left there

  his face was tight the scar standing out
very white against his skin yes he said
i know henderson he was my lawyer in
san francisco he didsuggest that we use
that plantation if i could get my fingers 

vou can said henderson he had
pushed open the door of ramus library
and was standing to shawns right his gun
covering the room

  drop it

  shawn dropped it surprise came up in his
big face and then hate to wash it away
when i get my hands 

  you wont said henderson he was very
pleasant about it and very business-like and
very deadly im going to kill you he added
almost as an after thought ive intended to
for some time

  the words rocked shawn but if henderson
noticed he gave no sign pick up the gun
ramus and get the one from the jerk whos
guarding you

  ramus obeyed

  henderson smiled thinly you were very
handy to have around kerby and youre a
fool we did fake that cipher to start the
treasure hunt ramus worked it out and i
planted it in sue pedarres trunk lid i thought
it was clever old plantations treasure the
two naturally go together

  my lips were a little dry but i managed to
smile wouldnt it have been simpler merely
to hi-jack the money yourself

  he shook his head it wouldnt i wasnt
certain how well it was guarded or what
might happen if there was a slip and the cops
came in i would be involved if you found it
and got as far as your car i thought we could
take it away from you

the

   and i suppose i die too

   he nodded unfortunately yes i hai
 nothing against you but you have no moi
 usefulness 

 and the girl  is she in the library
 he chuckled you are smart what bett
 concealment than stacks of ramus books
 shawn made a noise in his throat he too
 a step toward henderson the lawyers gu
 steadied stay where you are

   shawn took another step go ahead an
 shoot his tone was mocking you made
 mistake henderson youve let me get to
 close youll shoot me yes but all six bullet
 wont stop me and once i have your throat
  he jumped the gun roared the last shot
 were muffled by shawns vest every bulk
 took effect but he was right the power of h
 big body carried him to henderson his pow
 erful hands seized the lawyer between th
 shots there was a little snapping noise an
 they went down together hendersons nec
 was broken

       	 

 sue pedarre shuddered i never want t
 hear the word treasure again as long as i livi
 it was terrible in that room just listening
 it wasnt pretty to watch i told her
 and when the cops came in it we
 lucky 

   not so much luck i told her ever
 cop in town knows me by sight they tried t
 follow me earlier i stood out on the sidewal
 for awhile talking to ramus the station i
 only a few blocks away i knew someone woul
 spot me and that the law would show up
 thought they would come earlier

   but if you suspected mr henderson  
 i had no proof i set a trap by calling hii
 and telling him i was going to deal wit
 shawn at ramus office by that time i fig
 ured they had you i thought you might be z
 the office shawn lived at a hotel ramus in
 furnished room the library with its stacks 
 books would be a good place 

   she sighed youre kind of smart im sui
 prised that you ever got mixed up in thi
 thing 

   blue eyes have effect i grinned down z
  her youd be surprised what a pair of blu
 eyes would make me do

   she looked away but she didnt seem to h
 angry she didnt seem to be mad at all wha
 will they do with ramus she was trying t
 change the subject

   send him up probably best thing the
 could happen hed like the prison library
 youre hard

   you think so

   she didnt really her eyes showed tha
 when she turned back to face me they wer
 smiling and very very blue

end
my work was okay-but i was
plenty worried

i was scared i dont mind telling you
i was walking down a main street in my
home town with maybe a hundred peo-
ple on the sidewalk within call and still i
was scared worse than id ever been every
time an old scrap of newspaper blew out of
an alley mouth i almost cut and ran

  im not very big-something close to
average size i guess and ive never con-
sidered myself a brave man i have to work
up my nerve for a couple of weeks to make
the regular call to my dentist because the
thought of pain of being deliberately hurt
really gets me

  i was thinking about that and the whole
mess was the craziest thing id ever heard
of i stopped in front of the crosset jewelry
store and lit a cigarette the dark window
pane made a mirror for the street behind
me and i looked at that until the match
burned my fingers all i learned waslhat
i needed a shave and looked like hell in gen-
eral

  i dont know what i expected to see rusty

in these days living expenses are ad-
mittedly high but thirty thousand
dollars was a lot more dough than i
cared to put out for rent-on my
grave



cod-cash or death

by

henry norton


henry norton

the chauffeur or red-haired diana or joseph
grieve himself or the shape of fear i
didnt know what to expect i knew only
that i was scheduled to be killed   

tour days ago id been a quiet undis-
- turbed draftsman in an architects office
down town single with no more money in
the bank than youd expect and no entang-
ling alliances with babes or booze or betting
that would make anybody want to knock me
off i had as much fun as the average guy
but the company didnt like playboys or
trouble-makers so i kept my nose clean

  then four nights ago this big car met
me at the building entrance at five oclock
a tall slim guy in a chauffeurs cap and
uniform with shiny black boots came over
polite as you please

  youre john b severn he said

  it didnt sound like a question the way he
said it but i told him i was anyway and
he asked me if id be good enough to come
with him for a half hour said hed take me
home immediately afterward said it  was
important and to my advantage

  well it didnt make sense but ive given
up expecting everything to make sense any-
way so i climbed into five thousand dollars
worth of automobile and this guy started off
he couldnt-or wouldnt-tell me what it
was all about when i fired questions at
him hed just grin and shake his head

  we stopped in front of a big old stone
house in a quiet neighborhood and the
chauffeur followed me up the steps and rang
the bell the door was opened by a quiet
little man about fifty or sixty he had bright
blue eyes behind steel-rimmed glasses gray
hair brushed back in a smooth wave and
clothes that mustve cost as much as i make
in a month there was a girl in the hallway
behind him and she was-

  she was terrific she had red-gold hair
in the length i like down to her shoulders on
the side and a kind of page-boy deal in the
back there wasnt too much curl-the hair
looked like a burnished helmet on her head
like diana artemis you learn stuff like
that in architect school but she was terrific
she smiled at me and i came back with a
moon-faced grin i hadnt seen so pretty a
girl in all my life i was sure of that

  she had on a light green wool sport suit
that made her figure something to dream
about she stood by the door to the living
room doing nothing but smile at me and
the old guy took me by the arm and led me
past her the driver of the car followed us
and slouched down with one shining boot
cocked carelessly over a chair arm

  the old guy wasted no time

  my name is joseph grieve he said
cttid these are my associates whom you will
not see again if you are wise briefly sir
we want thirty thousand dollars

  it took the wind out of my sails completely
i suppose i looked ridiculous staring at the
guy i looked at the girl and at the odd-
acting chauffeur but neither of them seemed
to think it was a joke i looked back to the
little gray-haired man who called himself
joseph grieve

  perhaps i should explain more fully
the man said when i read that john b
severn had inherited a hundred thousand
dollars i had you brought here so that you
might not mistake the seriousness of our
intentions we are criminals mr severn
and we feel no compunction about it you
will either turn over to us thirty thousand
dollars of your new fortune or you will be
killed

  i could think of only one tiling to say

  is this a gag

  do you think so grieve said crisply
i assure you it isnt we know that the
money in cash will be in your possession
tomorrow the newspaper accounts of the
inheritance have been quite complete for-
tunately now here is a special delivery
envelope with my address on it it was ad-
dressed never mind how on a typewriter in
your office on your office stationery you
will enclose a cashiers check for thirty thou-
sand dollars explaining to the administrator
that it is a business transaction if that
check is in my hands friday you will never
see any of us again if it is not you will
be dead within four days no matter what
steps you may take to prevent it

  i turned the envelope over in my hands
it was an envelope from storm solvig and
company the outfit that hired me it was
rubber-stamped above the firm name with the
regular rubber stamp i use for my own mail
it was addressed to mr joseph grieve at
the address of the stone house we were in

  something about the calm and complete
efficiency of the whole thing sent a little
thrill of fear into me even then tightening
my stomach muscles making a tiny rill of
perspiration go down my spine

  ill go straight to the police i said

  i knew as soon as id said it that id
weakened my position by giving them even
that much of an argument id admitted a kind
of half belief in their deal i knew it by the
scornful tilt of the redheads lips the sudden
fierce brightness of grieves eyes i knew
it even better from the fact that my words
were hollow and gave me no comfort

  logical but quite useless grieve said
believe me one of our assets in this busi-
ngs is a flawless reputation we shall sim-
cod-cash or death



ply deny your charge and present convincing
evidence that it is merely a scheme on your
part to avenge yourself because diana here
has spurned your advances it will put you
in a very bad light in addition to which
you will still be killed

  do you people mean to sit here and tell
me youre serious about this i said my
voice wasnt any too steady but i drove it
do you honestly think this crazy scheme
has a chance of working  

  its worked before grieve said

  i stared at him

  remember clinton carruthers he asked
his smile was gentle but it held a queer
sense of menace like the smile of a tiger or
crocodile clinton carruthers was an attor-
ney in the same building you work in mr
severn he died they said from an over-
dose of sleeping pills he did not we killed
him because he refused what we asked

fhat one hit home id known carruthers
he took in a fancy fee just before his
death something like fifty thousand dollars
there was no reason why hed commit
suicide and nobody knew of him taking sleep-
ing pills but hed died from an overdose of
them just five days after he got his big
check it was peculiar to say the least

  but this would explain it quite nicely and
it did more than anything else to convince
me that these people meant business

  there was a way out i thought about it
but it wasnt a way i cared to use better
 take the rap myself than-no that way
yas no good so i decided to bluff it out
feally play hard to get and see what hap-
ened

  i stood up ill have to think about it

 said

  i could tell by the old guys grin that he
igured he had me hooked he nodded and
aid todays wednesday if you mail the
noney tomorrow itll reach me in time if

you dont if it doesnt get here by friday
you wont live through the weekend

  i didnt answer that i walked over to the
red-head she stood up as i came near and
her eyes were wary she was just as pretty
close up as shed been from across the room

  so diana you spurn my advances

  i put a hand under her chin none too
gently and kissed her hard on the mouth
for a second i thought she was going to
return the kiss and then she backed away
and swung a hand at my face it missed
and i walked out of the house behind me
the old man was grinning but the chauffeur
didnt seem too happy about things

  the more i thought about it the screwier
it got when i thought about carruthers
the idea seemed practical and dangerous
but when i thoughtabout myself it was just
funny because i could no more send grieve
a check for thirty grand than i could swim
the atlantic if i raked all my cash together
it might total seven hundred bucks but not
any more

  so i gave it a miss what else could i
do i went back to the office and turned out
the plans for the forbes store and they went
off pretty well charlie myers the head of
the drafting department came around about
four

  you been boozin he asked me

  whats the matter i said plans
wrong

  theyre okay he said he was a small
guy with fierce eyebrows and a kind of
nervous way of sniffling what i mean is
he said youve been so jumpy all day every
time anybody walks behind you you act like
theyre gonna stick a knife in your back

  maybe i had it was certainly closer to
the truth than i liked i wasnt sure

  so maybe i had a bad night i said

  better lay off charlie said you know
how the bosses go for that or maybe you
dont care now that you got all the dough

you get them

henry norton

  same sweet character i said

  well straighten up an fly right he
told me

  some fun

  a pack of predatory parasites preparing
to pop papa in the pants and im supposed
to act like it was april in paris i gave
charlie the grin i usually save for maiden
aunts at christmas and birthdays

  ill watch it i said

  my work was okay that was something
i left the joint at five and went home i
opened the door of the four room apartment
i call my castle and something made a big
noise in the fireplace throwing ashes up
and around more than somewhat

  when i got through jittering i went over
and looked and there was a typewritten
note on the mantle that was a firecracker
the note said it could have been a bomb
better send the money it wasnt signed
and it didnt need to be

  im enough of a construction man to fol-
low back the wires and see how nicely the
joint is wired for an explosion i got the
apartment manager on the phone and raised
hell

  said he was from the phone company
the manager told me why wouldnt i let
him in

  you ask for his credentials i wanted
to know

  would you asked the manager

  i shut up then chances were six two and
even the guy would have had good enough
credentials to get by an apartment house
manager anyway

  so i kept on letting it slide hell i didnt
have the dough they wanted but i couldnt
tell them that i had to sweat it out i had
to let it slide

  i went to the office next morning and about
ten-thirty i wanted a little coffee so i went
out there was a little car with its engine
idling by the corner as i went over it
started with a lunge and i missed being run
over by inches the car went slewing around
a corner and out of sight before there were
any cops available or before anybody got a
look at the mud-spattered license

  that was plenty i went to the police
and did i ever get a surprise

  the cops thought i was crazy the harder
i talked to make them see how serious it
was the more i could see that look on their
faces that said heres a nut with delusions
of persecution harmless maybe but
screwy 

  there was a sergeant named riley if
we started an investigation every time a fire
popped or somebody almost got hit by a
car he told me wed have time to do
very little else

  but these people threatened me i sai
heres the note that was on my mantl
hell you can see im not making this up

  he looked at the note turned it over ai
said storm solvig and company that
where you work 

  i dont know how id missed it the no
was on the reverse side of one of our ow
letterheads it looked plenty phony to rile
and i could see how it would but i had t
keep trying

  wont you even talk to them i askei
pleadingly

  he gave me a long unfriendly stare ye
i think i will he said finally i think
will

t sat there while he wangled the telephor
number out of information called and g
grieve on the line it wasnt a very ion
conversation and rileys face got darker an
darker as it went on he hung up at la
and swung around like he was going to slu
me

  ive a notion to run you in he said

  now hold on i said i know whs
grieve told you he said id been chasin
after his daughter that i was just tryin
to get even for being turned down

  it makes a good deal more sense tha
your story young man riley said ir
going to do a little checking up on you an
heaven help you if i find youre trying t
pull a fast one now get along with you

  when you came to think of it grieve di
have the better story of the two no co
was likely to belieye a wild thing like thei
threat and if any cop saw that red-heac
hed easily imagine a guy making passes a
her

  so i followed the sergeants advice an
got along i went down onto the street an
riley came out while i was still standinj
there he started to say something an
just then a truck going past backfired
was back in that doorway like a cat gettinj
off a marble-topped table riley looked a
me and frowned

  you got it bad havent you

  dont mind me i said i need exer
cise

  you sure you dont want to come bad
upstairs and talk to a couple of guys hi
said maybe we could find some place foi
you to lie down and rest a while

  in the psychiatric ward i snorted n
thanks

  now im warning you he said sternly
no funny business from now on or itll g
hard with you just dont try to start any-
thing

  all i want to do is stay alive i said
and im getting damned little co-operation 
cod-cash or death



 the fat was in the fire now but good

   grieve knew id gone to the cops hed
 have to get me fast now before i could con-
 vince anybody i was telling the truth maybe
 if i were killed now the police might think
 a little more of my story but that wouldnt
 do me any good that wasnt the way i
 wanted to convince them

   well i figured if the cops wouldnt be-
 lieve me id have to get help from someplace
 else i couldnt see myself licking the gang
 single-handed not with the way it was or-
 ganized and there was only one guy i could
 think of who might go to bat for me i went
 to the office

   charlie myers was sitting in front of a
 drafting board with a sour look on his face
 where the hell have you been he said
 three hours for lunch

   i let him have it straight charlie there
 are some people in town trying to kill me
 i need help 

    id rather help them he said

   no kidding i told him they think
 they can scare me into giving them some
 dough that or theyll bump me off

   for a minute he stared at me and forgot
to sniffle he leaned back in his chair and
said are you serious johnny you mean
 somebody really has threatened you

   hell yes i said i let him have the
 whole story then and he kept shaking his
 head as if he didnt know whether to believe
 me or not

   why dont you tell the police

   i did i said and they didnt believe
 a word of it the sergeant offered to throw
 me in the jug

   maybe that wouldnt be such a bad idea
j charlie said thoughtfully if this is the
straight goods youd be safer in jail than
any place else

    it was an idea but not one i liked

   i couldnt stay there forever i said
 and theyd be waiting for me when i came
 out no charlie i got to get the goods on
 them thats the only way

   you could pay em off charlie said
 theres that way after all you did inherit
 the dough maybe itd be smart to pay em
 off and get rid of em

   for a minute i was tempted to tell the
 straight of it to him but i couldnt see
 where id gain anything so i kept on playing
 it the other way

   hell itd only whet their appetites i
 said if they found out they could scare
 me into paying them once theyd keep at it
 a long as i had a nickel

   even that might be better than- 
 whose side are you on i asked him
 no im going to give em a run for it
 anyway

  okay he said what do you want me to

do

  damned if i know i confessed

  charlie sniffled thoughtfully what seems
to be indicated he said is some kind of a
trap where youd be able to make a record
of their voices even your pal riley wouldnt
be able to laugh that one off

  dictaphone i was thinking out loud

  say how about that charlie said
get em to come to your apartment pre-
tend youve decided to pay off or something
ill rig up a wire recorder and catch the
conversation from a closet or something like
that when we get enough evidence i step
out and throw a gun on em while you call the
police

  probably both get killed i said

  i can take care of myself charlie myers
said and there was a grimness about his
mouth that made him look like he meant it

t began to cheer up a little it looked like
id picked a pretty good guy to help me
and desperate as the chance was it was
better than sitting around waiting for a sud-
den and violent death from some unexpected
quarter

  how soon can we do it i said

  gimme your key he said its quarter
to three now you stay here till six and then
come home call this joker and have him
meet you at your apartment with his crew
ill have the trap all set

  thats action i said

  i shucked the apartment key off my chain
and handed it to him he wrinkled his nose
and said you better let me have some dough
to get the gear johnny i havent got it
to spare right now

  i gave him a check for a hundred and he
went on out i sat down and tried to get
joseph grieves phone number from informa-
tion it was an unlisted number and the
operator wouldnt give it to me so i called
riley

  i told him what i wanted and he bellowed
at me youre up to some more of your
shenanigans he roared didnt i tell you
id put you in the tank

  im going to get evidence enough so that
itll even penetrate that thick irish skull of
yours i told him give me that number
and stand by for a call about seven oclock
and i mean stand by 

  he argued a while but i finally got the
number i called grieve and he answered like
hed been sitting by the phone waiting for
me to call

  expecting to hear from me i asked

  genially he said no i was expecting to
hear from rusty the chauffeur i was ex-
pecting to hear that youd been taken care of


henry norton

  damn you i said

  i hadnt meant to let him get me down
but hearing him condemn me to death in such
a breezy fashion was too much i wished for
a crack at him then

  he chuckled youve come round havent
you

  so i went into my act yeah you win
i told him i cant go on dodging cars all
my life want to come up to my apartment
this evening and collect

   he said mail it as i told you

  no i said look grieve i think id
ought to get something for my dough hows
about a date with the red-head

   he hesitated thats something youll have
to arrange for yourself im afraid diana
is her own mistress in affairs of that nature
i was doubtful about that but i said any-
way you can bring her along cant you
youd better bring your boy rusty too be-
cause i might try to knock you off if i get
the chance

   id thought of that he said seriously
id prefer that you mailed the money as we
agreed

   its too late to get a check certified to-
night i said you can pick it up at my
apartment or you can go to hell i cant be
any worse scared than i am

  there was quite an interval i finally
said you still there grieve

   yes he said all right severn well
be over no funny business now

   that goes double i said

  which reminds me he said be very
careful on your way home rustys orders
are still to kill you and i wont be able to
warn him not to unless he calls in

tlfell thats where you came in with me
 sanding in front of the crosset jewelry
store unshaven dirty tense and scared as
all hell

  i skulked home trying to see everywhere
at once i didnt know what to look for but
believe me i didnt take a single chance i
could avoid and i got home alive which
was something but it wasnt enough for
the deal began to queer as soon as i put my
foot in the door

  they were all there alright grieve was
thumbing through a magazine diana the gor-
geous redhead was curled up on my daven-
port with her legs displayed to good advan-
tage and the fake chauffeur was leaning
against the wall by the door he cut over
quickly as i came in and closed the door
behind me

   but this was it charlie myers was sitting
there too chewing the fat with them like
they were old school chums

  for a second i figured theyd caught him

and made him sit down with them but on
look at his face made that idea no good

  brother i was trapped for fair-all i coul
do was try stalling them in the frantic hop
that i could figure an angle whatever hap
pened i decided then to make it cost then
plenty to get me

  so thats the way it is i said

  you werent very bright grieve said
how did you think we obtained the sta
tionery from your office if we didnt havi
someone there working with us

  and then the other idea got to me

  then its got to be a rub-out i said
even if i paid off you couldnt leave m
alive now that i know charlies with you
grieve nodded quietly as if murder was
a very small item to him as if a few corpse
more or less made no difference the red-
head gave me a nice smile

  hell with all of you i said you doni
get any dough out of it why should i paj
off if i know im going to get killed anyway
well do all right said charlie myers
when i took that check to the bank 
managed to find out you hadnt deposited the
money yet i know it isnt at the office sc
its got to be here someplace and well find
it brother we know how to make you talk
i dont usually cuss in front of women bu
what i told charlie then made him blink and
made grieves head come around the red-
head smiled a little wider she could take it
-that was plain

  i went over and sat down beside her on
the davenport i put an arm around her and
pulled her against me this time she co-
operated on the kiss plenty we held it way
past the movie limit then i put my mouth
down close to her ear

  sell these tramps out i whispered
why not take thirty grand all for yourself
instead of a split maybe we could have some
fun that way

  behind me i heard grieve say something
about let him have his fun the girl
pushed me away and looked to see if i
meant it i tried to look like i did

  im going to make a fight out of it i
whispered throw in with me and youll
get whats coming to you come on baby
make up your mind

  this time she kissed me and i had my
answer i turned around and looked at the
three men charlie and rusty were scowling
but joseph grieve wore the same serious
calm look as always

  i	said cant we make a deal fellows
you dont have to rub me out i know when
im beat ill turn the dough over and keep
my mouth shut if you let me live i warn
you it isnt going to be easy to find

  maybe we can grieve said maybe
cod-cash or death

we can work out some way first though
the money

  oh no i said as defiantly as i could

	first the deal

  i was standing up now walking around the
room and waving my arms a little like i
was really upset it took a little maneuver-
ing but i finally got between grieve and
rusty so i could reach both of them they
werent expecting me to try anything being
four to my one so when i got hold of both
of them and whanged their heads together
i really made a swell thump rusty went out
like a candle and all grieve needed to put
him out was a smash in the chops with my
left hand

  charlie myers jumped up and pulled a gun
out of his pocket the gal raised a little auto-
matic from the handbag in her lap and shot
him right in the stomach he sniffled once
sort of surprised gasped horribly and
dropped over

  nice going baby i said

  i phoned riley and then kept my arms
around the babe pretty constantly till he got
there which was long before grieve or
rusty came to riley didnt like the looks of
the thing but he simmered down when the
girl backed up my story she told him they
forced her to accompany them and i gave her

	very good self-defense angle for shooting

 ilvers

  may

    aybe youll get a light sentence dar-
ling i told her for turning states evi-
dence

  her face got white and she said but you
promised-

  i promised youd get what was coming
  you sister and i meant just that i said
  think riley better check on whether clin-
  arruthers had a red-haired maid when
  was poisoned

  felt like hell about it but she didnt fool
  any id seen her shoot a guy in the guts
  make a few thousand dollars i wasnt
  ng any

  iiiey said somewhat sheepishly youve
  tto admit it sounded crazy though maybe
  ts why it came so very very close to
  rking

  it was never close to working i said
use i didnt have the dough my old
s name is john b severn too hes
one who got the inheritance but the
rs never bothered to check up it wasnt
important
y the hell didnt you say so  riley
ixploded that wouldve taken them off
our back 	

  and put em on my dads i said ill
dmit i was scared brother-but not that
cared

deaths old
sweet song

they rode to the prison together sam
lester the big homicide lieutenant
and craig manton the girls lawyer in
mantons long sleek car

  it would pick this night to rain sam
lester said

  craig manton had been drinking and he
was in a surly mood it doesnt matter he
said he watched the rain dance on the wind-
shield why do they have to pick me he
spat out suddenly i dont want to see the
damn thing

  sam lester rubbed his blue-tinged jaw
theyre not too bad he said through his
cigarette smoke just a couple jerks against
the straps a little bit of a smell-and its all
over theyre not too bad

  craig manton swung his head around
sweat stood out on his forehead

  youre used to this he said thats why
i wanted you with me thats why i called
you he turned back to the road but a
girl   



  so what sam lester asked she kil
a man didnt she

  craig manton the girls lawyer watcl
the wet asphalt stream into the headligl
beneath the pelting rain

  he licked dry lips recalling the aftemc
that sam lester had spent in the lawye
office when they heard that the governor i
refused to grant a stay   

  craig manton had done the best a law
could but sam lesters men had pulled t
net too tight

  the girl had been found with the body t
gun was on the floor where shed dropped
her prints on it just those two in her drei
ing room they hadnt heard a shot it w
lost in the blaring music the band lead
had gone back to see why she didnt come c
for her number he found her standing o
spook slade the man she was supposed
love slade had been murdered

  bluebird was the name she sang under s
had lived up to it singing the blues as thi
she was just a two-bit blues singer and tonight she would
die in the chair-unless detective sam lester could spot
the one flimsy note that would trip up an unknown
murder maestro

should be sung from the heart not the lips

cam lester was a straight dick he could
 do nothing but let the cards fall as they
irould the girl was found guilty by a jury
which couldnt buck those cards the death
jenalty was mandatory

craig manton swung the car up before the
rison gates

execution witnesses sam lesjer told the
fuard who peered through the ram-streaked
vindow in a moment they were inside en-
ering the wardens office

warden kelly a tall man with white hair
ink cheeks gravely inspected their creden-
ials his face showed strain bluebird was
he second woman hed had in his death house
e knew what it would be like

lester and manton sat on hard chairs
tared at blue-gray walls stark and clean

 this is murder sam lester said

craig manton looked at him what dyou
bean

i mean the girl here is innocent

but it was your evidence  manton
egan

sam lester raised a big hand im a cop-
ier manton he said i had to go through
rith it the evidence forced me to still i
hink the girl is innocent

but you cant prove it manton said

as ive been telling you all day manton
f i could prove it id be up with the governor
nyself 

manton lighted a cigar puffed blue smoke
ip into the hot sick air of the room

im not through with this case sam
-ester said whether the da likes it or
lot

cigarette smoke swirled above the heads of
he men in the little room and sam lester sat
luietly waiting smoking talking softly to
raig manton

i had to take her he said all the cards
vere against her you knew her defense i
lidnt kill him i found him there yes i
licked up the gun from the floor where it was
lropped it when i realized  i didnt kill
jim he was no good but i loved him then
ibout her past about bluebird being strictly

a press agent stunt her name was marion
maxon and she came from groveton penn-
sylvania just a kid with a husky voice and a
heart that belonged to a no-good hoodlum

  that was it manton said what could
i do for her what could any attorney do
for her

  lester kept talking as if he didnt hear
manton about the gun he said there
was something about the gun one piece of
evidence that didnt tie in the da never
used it had enough lie said so i kept it i
wondered about it a funny little thing just a
piece that didnt fit i kept it and it tantalized
me told me that someone had framed that
girl someone very smart

  sam lester stopped lighted a cigarette
watched the smoke fan out from his lips

  manton was looking at lester tight lipped
you mean you had evidencethat you with-
held

  it wasnt withheld it was turned over to
the da it just didnt fit in

  what was it manton asked

  lester didnt have time to answer he was
called to the telephone

  he went into the other room to answer it
and manton sat back smoking and wait-
ing   

  sam lester came back with the warden

  it is time gentlemen warden kelly said
quietly his humanity was in his eyes his
face was lined he had a job to do he was
acting in accordance with the dictates of the
law he had no choice

  they went outside then into the lashing
rain across the prison yard to the death
house down a long corridor and into the
execution chamber the cub reporter followed
nervously inhaling a bent cigarette

  there were benches for them to sit on be-
neath a sign marked silence and the grim
instrument of justice at the other end-the
chair stark and fearsome waiting for the kill

  sam lester and craig manton sat in the
rear row despite the sign lester still talked
in a low soft voice charged with high excite-
ment

  my men are giving me a hand lester
was saying that was sergeant conroy on

by georgewilliam rae
	george william rae

the phone they went over that alley in the
rear of the blue moon again with a fine comb
they found a shell from the  that killed
slade he mustve been killed in the alley
carried inside and the girl is right-she did
find him that way

  its all theory craig manton said he
was a shrewd lawyer knew his evidence the
governor wouldnt-

  yeah i know sam lester said bitterly
manton wiped his mouth with the back of
his hand he looked tired worn

  he took a flask from his pocket drank deep-
ly he replaced the flask in his pocket then
carefully wiped his lips with the cobalt-blue
handkerchief which he always wore in the
breast pocket of his coat

  conroy is checking one last lead sam
lester said if it works out ill be able to
put the finger on the real killer

cam lester took one more telephone call
 in the autopsy room off the execution
chamber he was back quickly

  the warden is calling the governor one
last time he said we found out about an
angle the das invetisgating attorneys
muffed or passed up there was another guy
a big shot he was trying to make a play
for bluebird i think i can pin it on him we
found out this other guy was being black-
mailed by spook slade and that he was nearly
broke and half-crazy because bluebird wanted
no part of him he killed spook slade and
put the frame on bluebird

  craig manton took another drink whatre
they waiting for he asked

  lester said the warden hell be back
in a minute then hell either go on with it
or keep her in the cells it all depends on
what the governor says i tied in that last
piece of evidence the warden knows that
too that funny little thing that bothered me
so much i tied it in

  manton said i cant stand much more of
this

  it wont be long lester said his dark
eyes were half closed take it easy
manton had his flask out again i cant
stand it

  take it easy you got nothing to worry
about youre not going to the chair

  manton swung around savagely no irt
not but she is

  maybe sam lester murmured

  maybe-maybe why dont they get il
over with damn it i cant stand it
youre not going to the chair lester
voice was a low monotone

  mantons sullen eyes blazed suddenly anc
damn you too he cried youve been play-
ing cat and mouse with me all day i see i
now youve been sweating me working on
my nerves i see it now 

  a rumble rose from the men on the bench-
es they turned and stared at manton anc
lester sam lester was smiling he saic
nothing

  god knows what youve dug up manton
went on his voice rising you wouldnt lei
well enough alone let the girl die like 
planned for her to die

  manton stopped and stared around wide-
eyed yes i killed him because he was suck-
ing me dry and keeping her away from me
he had a hold over her she wouldnt give
me a chance 

  sam lester was on his feet as were all the
men in the execution chamber

  you were the one who arranged for me
to be a witness manton screamed at lester
you fixed it didnt you you devil well
youre coming with me

  a gun glittered in mantons hand he
swung it toward sam lester

  at that instant a sharp blue flame darted
from the police positive of lesters man-the
detective who had been masquerading as the
cub reporter

  mantons gun became a great weight in his
hand he dropped it and staggered back eyes
wide slowly he folded to the death chamber
floor gasping out his life

  sam lester bent over him get the doc
he said tersely

  lester took the cobalt-blue handkerchief
from mantons breast pocket and an envelope
from his own the blue thread in the en-
velope matched the blue of the handkerchief
sam lester looked down at craig manton
it was on the gun manton when you
wiped the prints off just that blue threat
caught on the sight just a little blue threa
to tie you up for hell

    it was a dark night in wairangel india when
 dr butchia answered a hurry call to the outskirts
 of his village to treat a patient in a dimly-lit
 house he found six brothers one of them ill the
 other five grimly expectant one thing they prom-
 ised him-prompt payment of his bill

    the doctor set to work despite his ministra-
 tions his patient sank steadily and five nights later
 the sick man died

    authorities found dr butchia had been buried
 alive with his patient-and sentenced the five
 brothers to life at hard labor

  the constancy of young ahmed djafeks love for
wealthy widow koprulu had become a byword in
anatolia turkey-even when she became desper-
ately ill he remained at her bedside administer-
ing to her wants heedless of possible contagion
from her mysterious malady friends finally were
called in to witness a wedding at the sick-bed

  the marriage rituals and festivities over neigh-
bors tiptoed out sure the bride would recover-
her voice had been a lot stronger than for some
time-but she didnt in fact medical examina-
tion proved conclusively that she had been dead
at the time of her wedding-and the courts proved
her groom to be a fortune-hunting-ventriloquist

    white mans justice is old in the british colony

called on to act as chance witness in a minor case

the pool of fear

by ken lewis

a thrilling mystery novelette
of creeping menace

      perhaps that dark bottomless pool the strangely frightened
      girl and the decayed empty grandeur of the silent house
      should have warned me    but i too counted myself as
      among the lost and the damned-and not even my grisly
      masquerade could save either ellen or me from the living
      death that crept about us

chapter one

dark water

dropped off the freight as it slowed
for the last curve before reaching the
milvale yards on either side of the rail-
road cut high clay bluffs cut off the view
but far ahead shimmering vaguely in the
wheat country heat rose the towers of the
flour mills which gave the town its only ex-
cuse for existence

  it looked like a thousand other places id
seen in the past two years and for the thou-
sandth time i asked myself what it was i
expected to find here or anywhere else for
that matter then i shrugged knocked some
of the cinders out of my hair and started up
an old bo path which climbed the right bluff
toward a grove of elms and sycamores at the


top id almost reached the crest when i no-
ticed the high wire fence girdling the trees
there a small sign red and white was nailed
to the nearest post

    trespassers beware-
    this fence is charged 

  i cursed it had been too much of a climb
almost thirty feet straight up in all this heat
just to turn around and go back down again
besides fences have always irritated me in
the end i shinnied up the post taking care not
to touch the top strand of wire and dropped
over into the trees on the other side

  about ten yards in the grove began to
thin and i could hear muted sounds of splash-
ing ahead ten yards more and i came out

   he screamed and fired his first shot   j

at the edge of a natural rock-bound pool-
the kind of place they call a gravel pit in
california but which here would be known
as a quarry hole

  a girl was swimming in the pool with
just her head shoulders arms and feet show-
ing intermittently as she stroked

  i started to fade back into the trees and
then i caught her watching me and grinned
at her

  pardon me but is this the milvale public
baths

  she laughed her face puckered up like a
childs and her eyes crinkled they were nice
eyes a kind of gray-blue which went well
with her taffy hair and there was no fear in
them at all only a very small touch of obscure
longing

  but there was something about the laugh
which didnt quite fit-certain high thin over-
tones id heard before i studied her

  i didnt think it was that funny

  you dont know how funny it was no
ones come over that fence in years

  i dont like fences

  her eyes seemed to darken a little tread-
ing water she looked almost boyish with her
slender freckled face and flat beautifully
curved lips

  no neither do i well as long as youre
here you might as well join me

  i eyed the dancing water hungrily love
to only i seem to have forgotten my swim-
ming trunks

  thats all right ill promise not to look
till you get in

  something told me this was crazy that i
ought to be on my way right now instead i
grinned

  fair enough its a deal

  she turned in the water to face the knoll
opposite while i slipped out of shoes pants
and shirt

  hows the bottom i called i mean
can i jump in right here without cracking my
noggin

  oh there isnt any bottom or if there
is no ones ever been deep enough to find it
i think it goes straight through to china its
artesian you know very cold

  i dived in head first and felt the pull on my
heart as the icy water wrapped me i came
up gasping and tingling and found her laugh-
ing at me from about ten feet away

  she didnt make one-tenth the work of it
that i did but she always managed to keep
the same distance between us finally i had
to take hold of a root beside the bank and
call it quits

  youre good at this like youd done it
before

  she was facing the other way but i could

tell by her voice that she didnt like my
implication

  why shouldnt i be able to swim thats
all there is to do around here she pulled
herself out and disappeared into the trees

a ll the time i was dressing i could hear
her back in the grove somewhere sob-
bing i tried to tell myself that i didnt get
it that i didnt know what was wrong and
didnt care but i think i was beginning to
get it even then

  she was sitting hunched over on a log
when i finally found her she had put on
a pair of blue coveralls but there was plenty
that was feminine about her

  i didnt mean anything by that crack i
said

  she had stopped crying now but her mouth
had a sullen twist i know what you meant
and i asked for it what else could i ex-
pect inviting a-a tramp from the railroad
tracks to go swimming with me do you think
id have done a thing like that if there was
anyone else i could ask i guess you dont
know what its like to be lonely so lonely
youd welcome the company of the lowest
tramps that ever lived just to have another
human being around

  she wasnt trying to be gentle about it i
nodded yes i said slowly i know all
about loneliness i guess i could write a book
about it but if youre so damned forlorn why
dont you find somebody respectable to play
with  i thought that fence was to keep other
people out not you in

  she laughed and it was all ugly overtone
this time the fence isnt needed to keep
other people away im enough for that no
one will come near this place not even to
work they think im sick

  are you sick

  i had a nervous breakdown

  she watched me carefully for my reaction
i shook my head-
that doesnt mean anything people have
been having them for years and getting over
them

  she was studying me more closely now still
frowning but with something new in her
eyes

  whats your name

  i dont know why i gave it to her straight
i hadnt done that for two years but some-
how despite her ugly mood i liked this girl
and felt sorry for her i told her the truth
stephen langley not that it matters
she nodded yes i knew you were a
doctor the way you looked at me back there
at the pool just like dr welsh at the
sanatarium 

  i could feel the old bitterness crowding me
the pool of fear



hard i shook my head you were right the
first time im just a bum

  i read your book dr stephen langley
the incidence of maniac depressive symp-
toms in late adolescence dont tell me
youre not the man who wrote that book
no i said im not the man i may
have his name his measurements even his
fingerprints but the man who wrote that
book died two years ago hes as dead as that
log youre sitting on and so goodbye

  she let me get as far as the third row of
trees then she called out suddenly and her
voice had that little rising note of hysteria
that id noticed earlier in her laugh

  doctor doctor langley you cant
leave me now when i need you so its in
your ethics you cant turn away a patient

  i wheeled to find her directly behind me
her lips were parted and her eyes were bright
she was panting

  i told you im not a doctor any more i
snapped and a bum has no ethics 

  all right all right then bum ill put it
this way howd you like to sleep between
sheets for a change howd you like a nice
warm homecooked meal    oh im not
offering any handout theres work to be
done around this place and i told you the town
people wont come here to do it i could
probably get my brother to put you on for
awhile as handyman or are you afraid like
the others

  i knew it was just a ruse that she thought
if i stayed she could find some way to make
me treat her

  i thought so too and i knew i had no
business doing that-nor any right to

  i said whats your name

  ellen ellen beaumont

  all right miss beaumont but strictly in
the capacity of handyman

rphe house was one of those two-story
colonial types with a facade of decaying
white pillars and a shingle roof that needed
patching we reached it from the pool by
crossing a rolling five-acre pasture by-passing
a ruined garden plot and circling a musty
brick carriage house a brick drive wound
through the front lawn from the gates out
front and the lawn itself was dotted by huge
old black walnut trees the grass growing high
around their trunks and littered with the rot-
ting husk of last years nuts

  she led me to a second-floor bathroom that
must have pre-dated the first world war
and waited in the hall outside while i shaved
with rusty water from a thumping fauceu- it
was as though she feared i might escape
if left to my own devices

  one thing she called you mustnt tell

tim about me swimming in the pool hes
forbidden me to go there

 why

  my mother drowned there when i was a
little girl

  an accident

  yes she had a cramp but tim had to
pull her out afterwards i was too small and
daddy didnt swim   hes never forgotten
it

  tim your brother he lives here too
yes dad left the place in my name but
tim had to take charge when i was committed
he also looks after my interests at the mill
poor tim-hes practically spent the past ten
years taking charge of me hell go on doing
it too unless i can find some way to make
you help me hes a grand guy-very de-
voted but i dont want to ruin whats left
of his life 

  i grunted what makes you think you
need any help the hospital discharged you
didnt it

  yes but only because theyd given up on
me oh they didnt tell me that of course
but i know i know they think im a hope-
less case

  and you think i could succeed where they
failed a bum like me

  you could try ive read your book i
know how highly it was regarded at the san
i threw open the door between us

  look lady lets get this straight im
not a doctor any more i couldnt treat you
even if i wanted to

  youve been disqualified

  not officially but ive disqualified my-
self

  how wont you tell me about it

  i could feel myself freezing up inside could
feel my thoughts twisting and turning des-
perately hunting some cranny of escape then
i remembered the similar symptoms id wit-
nessed so often in my patients and the argu-
ments id had to use to break them down to
convince them that running away did no good
that it only prolonged the agony and the cure
and at last i faced her

  yes i said ill tell you about it for
your own good its not pretty but here it
is  i had a patient once a woman who
thought she was in love with me i put her
down as a mild neurotic when actually she
was a dangerous paranoiac whom anyone but
a bumbling incompetent blinded by his own
ego would have committed to an institution

  but i had faith in her confidence in my
ability to help her-and i even let her come
to my own home for treatment and one day
when i was out of the room for the moment
she stole into the kitchen where my wife
was getting dinner she hated my wife


ken lewis

blamed her for my own failure to reciprocate
her love there was a butcher knife lying
on the table and she used it   she ended up
in a hospital for the criminally insane my
wife ended up in the morgue and i ended up
riding the rods after trying various other
methods of escape and finding them all
futile

  now do you see why i cant help you
why i could never treat anyone again why
it wouldnt be fair to me or the patient

  i must have shouted the last of it she had
slumped down on the edge of the tub while
i talked and now her eyes were the biggest
and softest eyes ive ever seen but her voice
when it came was clear and crisp

  no no i dont see you had the knowl-
edge and the ability once and you didnt lose
them by just making a mistake the doctor
doesnt live who hasnt made mistakes most
of them compensate for those mistakes by the
help they are able to give others afterwards
all im doing is offering you that chance
youre my last hope and if theres any good
left in you at all youre going to help me
at least youre going to try  

chapter two

the house that terror built

two brisk honks of greeting came from
the street out front followed by the rasp
of the front gates opening and the sound of a
car turning into the drive

  her face lighted theres tim now youll
like him she raced along the hall and
down the stairs

  remember i growled hustling to keep
up im just joe doaks an applicant for the
job of handyman

  the car a  packard sedan had stopped
before the veranda when we reached the door
and a tall slender man with sandy hair and a
thin red line of mustache came bounding up
the front steps he shot me a glance of sheer
surprise dropped the market bag he was
toting then ignored me completely while he
gave his sister a big warm grin and a long
hug her eyes danced like a little girls wel-
coming daddy home from the office

  at last she pushed back laughing and
pointed to me look tim-what ive found
this is steve lang our efficient new handy-
man  

  he subjected me to a half-amused scrutiny
he had red-brown eyes with that little shine
an over-active thyrus sometimes causes and
i put him down as at least ten years older
than her which would make him about my
age-thirty-three

well he said he certainly has the shoul-

ders for it howd he get in-climb the
fence

  of course not silly he called to me
from the gate and when i found out he
wanted a job i let him in right away i know
how hard youve been hunting for someone to
help with the work around here

  stranger in town

  i nodded got in this afternoon-by fast
freight 

  his grin was just the right size he hadnt
exactly impressed me as the democratic type
but now he put out his hand

  glad to have you with us lang you can
bunk in the gardeners old room in the car-
riage house but im afraid youll have to put
up with us at meal times we havent the
facilities for keeping a separate table   and
speaking of meal time im drooling youll
find some steaks in the bag sis i think theres
enough for three  

  the steaks were tough we worked on them
awhile with the blunt old case knives we were
using and then he pushed back his chair with
a mock frown

  this seems to call for sterner measures
he crossed to an old-fashioned china closet
in the corner unlocked its top drawer with a
key from his pocket and took out three sharp
short-bladed steak knives with ornate ivory
handles he passed them around

  the meal done he turned to me

  your first job lang will be to take my
place in the kitchen and help ellen with the
dishes i have to dash those old fuddy-
duddies who run the mill pick the most un-
godly hours for their board meetings

  by the way when youre through youd
better put those knives back where they came
from i left the drawer ajar but it locks
when closed that sets a sort of heirloom-
one of the few remaining mementoes of a
decadent familys grand past it would be a
shame if anything happened to them
when hed gone ellen made dish water
in the kitchen while i cleared the table then
she washed while i dried getting through
first and apologizing for leaving me to finish

  maybe it hasnt been much a day for you
she said but im dead more excitement
than theres been around here for weeks im
going to bed

  her eyes did have a tired febrile look at
that

  after she left i put the dishes and silver
in their proper places in the cupboard as shed
showed me but when i came to the steak
knives i could find only two

  i went through the kitchen and dining room
throroughly hunting the third and finally
opened the drawer in the china closet where
they were kept there were three in there
the pool of fear



making five of the set of six i put my two
with the others and returned to the kitchen
thinking that perhaps the missing member had
been dropped into the regular cutlery drawer
by mistake

  it hadnt it hadnt but i did find out one
thing that drawer didnt contain a single
cutting instrument worth the name just a
couple old paring knives so dull and worn that
theyd have bent double if you tried to force
them through anything more solid than a head
of cabbage

  i could feel the skin tightening across my
scalp apparently there was more than one
reason why timothy beaumont kept those nice
sharp steak knives under lock and key

  after that i went up the stairs and knocked
on her door

  i want to talk to you ellen

  im in bed cant it wait until morning
her voice held the sulky sullenness of the
early afternoon

  no it cant wait i tried the door and
found it locked your brother gave me
specific instructions about those steak knives
i want him to find all six in the drawer when
he comes home

  i dont know what youre talking about
go away now and stop bothering me or ill
have to report you

  so shed have to report me she who less
than six hours ago had practically been on
her knees begging me to stay

  ellen i said tightly i want that knife
ye gods-youve got knives on the brain
i saw that this afternoon why dont you go
through your own pockets    her voice
softened a little im sorry steve its just
that im so tired   the gardeners room is
in the loft of the carriage house youll find
a key flashlight and clean blankets in that
closet at the end of the hall that knife must
still be in the kitchen some place well look
for it again in the morning  

for awhile i was willing to believe her
to believe that maybe tim had taken the
knife hoping to throw suspicion on her-or
me but after id settled myself in the creak-
ing bed in the carriage house loft and had
time to think about it some more i knew she
was lying

  and i knew something else that i didnt
want to get mixed up in a thing like that
again i tried to tell myself that this was as
good a way to spend a couple of weeks as any
that the bed was soft and the food passable
and if i stuck it out till id accumulated a
little stake in my jeans the going would be
easier when i hit the road again

  but i could feel the old compulsion build-
ing up inside me the compulsion to be on my

way no matter where and the fact remained
that anyone who didnt have to would be
crazy to stay around a place where knives
disappeared as soon as they were taken from
their locked drawers for a minute brother
that was just asking for it 

  still it took me almost two hours of that
kind of thinking to get me out of bed and into
my clothes again because through it all i
kept remembering the way shed looked that
afternoon and the way her voice had sounded
pleading for the help she thought i could give
her and she needed help i knew that now
regardless of who had taken the knife she
needed help  

  a few yards beyond the carriage house
door i paused for a last look at her window
it was dark an early moon rode above the
railroad cut to the north and in its diffused
glow the rot and decadence of the place was
washed away the house stood big and white
against the night with only a few vaguely
darker patches to show where the siding
needed paint and the roof new shingles

  the weeds in the neglected garden plot
might have been flowers about to bloom and
the rolling acreage beyond a pasture where
trim young morgans frolicked waiting to be
broken to the saddle in the moonlight the
whole place looked like the haven of stately
dignified good living it once had been

  but it didnt tempt me much id seen it
by daylight

  skirting the trees to the point where the
path dead-ended against the far side of the
fence i had to pass by the pool again its
surface glistened like black glass beneath the
moon and i remembered how good that cold
spring water had felt that afternoon it was
the time of night when the world is supposed
to be cooling off but that wheat country heat
hadnt lifted an inch since noon and pretty
soon i was pulling off my clothes again for
a last dip before i went over the fence

  id been splashing around for about ten
minutes when i heard someone coming across
the pasture moving fast and kind of panting
about it i turned in the water to face the
sound and pretty soon there he was timothy
beaumont silhouetted on top of the knoll his
long thin arms and legs moved with a sort
of jerky tension like a badly-manipulated
marionette his tongue was caught hard be-
tween his teeth and his face was as white as
the skull of one long dead his fingers opened
and closed spasmodically on the butt of the
-gauge pump gun in his arms

  before i could yell at him to take it easy he
caught sight of my face bobbing in the water
and the gun barrel levelled off

  i submerged

  none too soon the sound of the gun was


ken lewis

a hollow ringing in the water and i could
almost feel the shot slapping against the sur-
face above my head

  i scissored into the shadows of the rock
ledge where he stood before i came up for
air

  dont shoot i gasped i was leaving
anyway

  the water interfered with his sense of
direction i could see him almost directly
above me searching the far bank with fren-
zied eyes

  who-who is it he croaked

  steve lang the man you hired this
afternoon i just came down for a midnight
plunge 

 my god my god-dont ever do that
again i-i thought it was prowlers

  he collapsed on the ledge his face slack
with relief too spent to think of helping me
over the side

  you look like you might have thought it
was a ghost i said drily hunkering down
on the grass beside him howd you know
anyone was down here

  the fence i heard you when you touched
the fence its wired to a buzzer in my
room   weve been having trouble with
prowlers lately i havent had a full nights
sleep in weeks but ive never been able to
catch them at it

  nuts what is there in here that anyone
would want to steal

  he shook his head no its not that i-i
think its some of the youngsters from town
trying to sneak in here for a swim the
waters too cold for that im afraid they
might drown thats why i put up the fence
in the first place

  well i pointed out filling them full of
leads indeed a very poor way to insure their
safety

  he tried to laugh it came out as a dry
whinny he was still too shaken to more than
talk coherently

  oh-i wouldnt shoot at them just over
their heads give them something to think
about in case they had any plans for coming
back

t thought of the way that shot had
spanked the surface at the exact spot
where my head had been a split second before
and decided that maybe sister ellen wasnt
the only beaumont who could use a good
psychiatrist

  i didnt come within twenty yards of that
fence tonight i said studying the grove
which fringed the pools far side how
long has it been since those trees were
pruned probably a branch has grown so
that it scrapes the fence when the breeze is

right ill try to locate it and cut it off to-
mor-ww

  he shook his head weakly we had an
accident here once befftre i dont want a thing
like that to happen again

  you mean your mother ellen told me
about it this afternoon

  he eyed me dully yes ellens mother
  not yours

  no my mother was the old mans first
wife she-she left him when i was five
and left you too

  his voice got a little more starch in it
no one knew her ever condemned her for
it the old man wasnt easy to live with el-
lens the only one who ever got along with
him   look old man im afraid youd better
not stay here after all theres something
about ellen you dont know 

  i could feel the sack coming and all at
once an unreasoning stubbornness possessed
me half an hour ago id been all ready to
call it quits and leave now i felt just as ob-
stinate about being kicked out the ramifi-
cations of this thing were intriguing

  i know all about ellen i cut in beau-
mont im afraid i invaded your premises un-
der false pretenses this afternoon but it
was the only way i could get in without arous-
ing her suspicions and for the time i prefer
to remain icognito where shes concerned
he was eyeing me more closely now what
are you getting at

  i grinned apologetically the fact that im
really doctor stephen langley of california
my old friend dr welsh sent me here he
wasnt quite sure of ellens condition when
she left the sanatarium and he knew i
specialized in her type of aberration

  his eyes were narrow why didnt you
tell me this before

  i shrugged this is the first chance ive
had to see you alone 

  gradually his shoulders relaxed and a
look of very real relief crossed his face he
held out his hand

  by god doc he breathed im glad
youre here frankly i-i havent been too
satisfied with ellens condition lately she
seemed to be all right when she first came
home but during the past few weeks she-
well im afraid shes slipping back again

  i nodded small wonder cloistered away
here with no outside contacts she needs
people around her friends something to take
her mind off herself have you tried to do
anything about that

  he nodded ruefully yes i tried i plan-
ned a surprise homecoming party for her the
night she came back not a soul showed
up   i guess you dont know much about
the people in these little back-country towns
the pool of fear



doc theyre still pretty medieval when it
comes to things like nervous disorders and
in some idiotic way i think they blame her
for what happened to jeremy richards
whos jeremy richards

- her first and only beau again his eyes
narrowed i supposed you were familiar
with her case history

  i shook my head i follow rather eccen-
tric methods beaumont i prefer to go into
these things cold with no preconceived diag-
noses to throw me off the scent   tell me
about it when did she first begin to show
symptoms of emotional instability

  he looked away she was always a little
on the high-strung nervous side he said
but nothing serious ever happened till the
night jeremy richards jilted her

  all right-lets have it what sort of guy
was this richards

  he shrugged oh he seemed to be a nice
enough lad he delivered groceries here
thats how they met they fell in love and de-
cided to elope his folks didnt want him to
marry and she had some silly notion that i
wouldnt aprove either    but weve always
been rather close to each other especially since
the old man died so a day or so before the
scheduled elopement she broke down and told
me all about it

  i wont pretend to have been overjoyed
they were only nineteen at the time and-
well young richards wasnt exactly in the
beaumont social circle but shed made up her
mind and after all that was all that mattered
i hope i have more sense than to try to tell
any girl whom to fall in love with-especially
my own sister    but i pointed out that an
elopement would be foolish they could be
married right here in her own home she was
tickled to death but afraid jerry might not
like it if he found out so we decided to sur-
prise him

  she would go down to meet him when he
came up the path from the tracks as original-
ly planned then i would step out of the trees
waving my shotgun and marshal them up to
the house where the minister and wedding
guests would be waiting the whole thing
would just be a big gag im afraid it was
rather crude but you know the sort of thing
the smart young set in any town thinks is
funny he paused

  but i take it jeremy didnt show up for
the party

  he didnt show up of course its obvious
what happened they had been putting too
much pressure on him at home-probably
threatening him with an annulment if he went
through with it-and he couldnt take it but
he couldnt stand to break the news to ellen
either so he lit out and he hasnt been
heard from since

qiie cracked up that night

   he nodded heavily we left the house
together with the guests sitting around in the
dark and giggling at my prop shotgun she
took up a position at the top of the path
there wasnt any fence then and i hid back in
the trees where i could watch her and time
my entrance i could see her tightening up as
the minutes dragged by and no one showed up
from the tracks below and finally she had
hysterics and collapsed and i had to carry her
back to the house and put her to bed to tell
the guests they could go on home now that
thered be no wedding at the beaumont men-
age that night his jaw tightened it wasnt
more than a week till they had to come and
take her away

  he was shaking all over now with the strain
of reliving it i put a hand on his arm and
helped him up on the way back to the house
he suggested that i move into the room across
the hall from hers where i could observe her
better

  well tell her the gardeners rooms unten-
able-rats or something

  he waited outside the carriage house while
i went in and picked up my bed-roll then
we entered the house together and walked up
to the second floor hall

  his room was the first to the right of the
stairs the door was open and as he stepped
through it i saw something gleam in the shaft
of moonlight across the room

  the something was an ivory-hafted steak
knife held in the hand of ellen beaumont

a s my eyes adjusted to the gloom i could
see her in there standing by his bed in
her nightgown she was facing us and her
face was as blank as a sleeping babys all but
her eyes they held a kind of dull sickly
shine

  then they fastened on him and her fea-
tures convulsed in an expression of the most
burning and implacable hatred ive ever seen
the knife came up and she began to advance
slowly toward us

  he stumbled back his face as white as it
had been down by the pool oh god- he
choked throw the blankets at her do
something his fingers began to scrabble
along the wall hunting the light switch

  i forced them down shes somnambulant

i hissed a sudden shock right now might
force her into a crisis from which shed never
recover get back in the hall-out of sight
go get her a sedative if theres any in the
house 

  th-theres nembutal he whispered from
behind me but she doesnt react to it very
well ive tried it before but she always stays
awake

  get it anyway a double dose put it in a


ken lewis

glass of milk and leave it on top of the china
closet downstairs but for gods sake stay
out of her sight wait in the kitchen   

   i could hear him stumbling down the steps
 behind me i was watching her she had
 stopped moving when he disappeared from the
 room and now her eyes were as black as be-
 fore but the knife was still lifted

   i remained perfecdy motionless hello
 ellen i said softly as though i was talking
 te a sleeping child im glad you found the
 knife now we can put it back in the drawer
 downstairs before tim comes home
 timm- the words were thick slurred
 timm-not home

   not yet i crooned well have time
 to put the knife back where it belongs before
 he gets here come on well do it together
 her eyes swung dully to the knife as though
 she had never seen it before all-all right
 stevie

   i stepped forward slowly and took her arm
 the one with the knife i let my fingers rest
 gently on her elbow but all the way down-
 stairs i was ready to tighten that grip like a
 vise if the need arose

   the drawer of the china closet was still
 ajar she dropped the knife into it without a
 tremor and then i picked up the drugged
 glass of milk tim had left on the cabinet and
 offered it to her

   heres a nice glass of milk i poured you
 to help you sleep i said drink it and
 then well go to bed

   she swallowed it like an obedient five-year-
  old then she said i dont want to go to
  bed yet stevie i want to be with you

 i walked her over to an old-fashioned love
 seat in the corner she didnt seem to want to
 talk so we just sat there pretty soon her
 arms slid arourd my neck and she kissed me
 i kissed back jvhat else could i do

   it did something to me but before i had
 time to think about that her lips had left my
 mouth and her eyes had closed and she was
 sleeping gently with her head on my shoulder
 ten minutes later when her breathing had
 deepened and her head had slipped a little i
 picked her up and carried her back upstairs
 she was sleeping like the enchanted princess
 when i tiptoed out of her room

   tim was still in the kitchen when i got back
 downstairs he had a fifth of bourbon and
 there were still four drinks left in it i had
 three of them

   you say she doesnt usually react to
 nembutal i asked

   that was a triple dose he told me grim-
 ly in a way she reacts to a normal dose too
 but she doesnt get sleepy-just high so high
 that she even draws a blank the next morn-
 ing

   i nodded it has that effect on some people

 leaves them conscious and even lucid after a
 fashien thats why its sometimes used in
 childbirth now but if its no good as a seda-
 tive for her how come you keep it around
 he shrugged it works fine on me
 again i nodded something like this to-
 night has happened before hasnt it

   he eyed me glumly frankly-yes though
 its never been quite this close before but
 thats why i always lock her door from the
 outside before i turn in only that damned
 buzzer sounded before i got around to it to-
 night

   i poured myself another drink well you
 mustnt let it affect your feeling for her she
 was walking in her sleep-acting out a night-
 mare probably didnt recognize ydu at all in
 your true identity when she started for you
 with that knife

   the liquor had brought back some of his
 color he was even able to manage a wry
 grin i know but you must admit it is
 damned disconcerting

chapter three

return of the living dead

t went to her room at nine the next morn-

 	ing with a hot pot of coffee and eggs and
 bacon in an antique chafing dish she hadnt
 stirred from the position in which id left her
 the night before her taffy hair was tousled
 on the pillow and her face was very soft and
 young and vaguely disturbed in repose

   i put up the blinds and returned to her bed
 she opened her eyes to find me smiling down
 at her she blinked bewilderedly and then
 recognition swam into them and she lifted one
 hand from the covers in a clinging gesture
 her lips moved

   oh steve im so glad youre here

   i grinned brightly thought you might
 like breakfast in bed for a change how do
 you feel this fine hot morning

   she twitched slightly and her eyes dark-
 ened

   terrible-except about you being here my
 head aches and i feel all sick and scared in-
 side like id had another of those horrible
 dreams

   you dream a lot

   sometimes but i can never remember a
 thing about them the next morning just that
 i always wake up so tired and frightened aft-
 erwards its maddening 

	 

   we had been for a swim in the pool and
 were lying on the knoll now letting the sun
 dry us three days had passed since my first
 hectic night with the beaumonts and so far
the pool of fear



i hadnt been getting anywhere much there
had been no more somnambulistic nightmares

   ellen i said dreamily tell me about
the night you were going to get married-
her face clouded and i went on quickly
never mind if you dont feel up to it but
tim said that you collapsed down here that
night that was a pretty strong reaction un-
der the circumstances i wouldnt have ex-
pected that to happen till youd at least had
time to make sure that jerry had really run
out on you-that he hadnt merely been pre-
vented from meeting you by some accident or
sudden illness that night

   her head shook its not that id mind
telling you if i could steve its just that i
cant remember-not a thing couldnt even
remember the next day the doctors at the
san put it down as amnesia accompanying
emotional shock but even they couldnt pierce
that particular curtain

   i grunted id like to know this jeremy
richards i said id like to see what kind
of a bird could walk out on a swell dish like
you you dont happen to have a picture of
him do you

   she smiled wanly i dont need a picture
of him with you around youre very like
him steve you even have his tall dark hand-
someness and football shoulders youre just
a little older steve thats all but so am i
you could take his place-completely

   it was very hard for me to remember the
proper relationship between doctor and patient
at moments like this

t dont know exactly when it was that i
definitely decided on hypnosis sometime
the next day i think i knew the danger of
trying it this early in the treatment that it
might fail completely and make the final solu-
tion that much harder but the old restless
compulsion was on me again and i knew too
that the more time i spent with ellen beau-
mont the harder it would be for me to say
goodbye when the time did come then there
was always the danger that tim might some-
how find out my true status here and kick me
out forthwith thus ending the treatment right
now

   i explained all this to her leaving out my
personal feelings of course and she agreed
shed undergone it before at the hospital
without too much success

   so i took her up to the gardeners room in
the carriage loft on one of those warm lazy
afternoons and had her stretch out on the bed
in her sunsuit and get comfortable then i
pulled all the shades down tight and carefully
punched a tiny hole in one so that a stiletto-
thin blade of sunlight pinpointed the low table-
top beside her head where her eyes could rest
upon it naturally

   after that i assembled my razor and cov-
ered the spot with its flanged end till a single
flickering bead of light danced there in the
three-quarter darkness i told her to concen-
trate on that glow

   she reacted beautifully it was no trick at
all to put her under

  you know what hypnosis is of course
merely an induced sleep in which the subjects
subconscious remains in contact with the prac-
titioner

   all it takes on the part of the patient is the
ability to relax completely plus an implicit
faith and confidence in the doctor what it
takes on the part of the doctor is something of
a profesrrpnal secret dangerous in the hands of
the untra ed which we wont go into here

  when i judged that she had reached the
proper state  began to question her slowly
and softly it was a difficult exhausting and
complex process trying to dredge up those se-
crets which the tortured mind had striven so
frantically to force down into oblivion but at
last i decided id achieved the maximum pos-
sible results one of the things i took especial
note of was the complete description she was
able to give to me of the way jeremy rich-
ards had been dressed on the night he dis-
appeared 

tone i broke contact and decided to let
her sleep it off normally i was about to
tiptoe out for a smoke when the loft door was
flung violently inward and timothy beau-
mont stood there on the threshold taking in
the half-revealed scene his thin face dark-
ened with fury and his eyes became danger-
ous pinpoints of red-brown light

   this does it langley he said thickly
youre through 

   i pushed him roughly out the door closing
it behind me and sidewheeled him down the
stairs

   shut up i hissed youll wake her if
you have to shout at least wait till we get into
the house to do it

   what were you doing to my sister

   i snapped i was hypnotizing her its a
recognized therapeutic technique in cases like
this

   he was still trembling violently with rage
you might be able to fool me with that dou-
ble-talk if i didnt know the truth about you
but i called welsh the day after you got here

i found out he knew you only by reputation-
and that wasnt good he told me how youd
cracked up two years ago-gone on a two-
month bender and then dropped out of sight-
after botching a job on one of your patients
and letting her kill your wife   

   i should have kicked you out right then
but damn it you seemed to know how to han-
dle ellen and under the circumstances i was


ken lewis

glad to have someone else around the place for
awhile even if it was only a drunken bum
but this today is too much get out if youre
not off the place in ten minutes ill call the
police 

  i didnt say anything what was there to
say i just walked leadenly up the stairs
while he waited fuming by the telephone in
the lower hall and gathered up the handful of
pocket articles id left in my room on the
way back down i slipped into his room for
a minute and examined the shotgun he kept
beside the bed there its magazine contained
five shells i pumped them out removed the
paper wadding at their ends and poured the
shot from each into my pocket then i refilled
the casings with strips torn from my pocket
handkerchief tamping the cloth down tight
against the powder charges and replaced the
waddings at their ends after that i re-
inserted the shells in the magazine and left
the gun where it had been before

  if death paid a visit here tonight-and i
had an uncanny feeling that it might-then i
meant to make sure that it didnt effect its
entrance by means of that gun

  timothy beaumont was still sitting by the
telephone when i came downstairs his pale
face suffused his sandy hair rumpled neither
of us spoke as i swung through the door and
down the drive to the gates out front

	 

  forthwith i paid my first visit to the town
of midvale i still had fourteen dollars in my
pocket residue of five days work in the harvest
fields the week before and i found a little
second-hand clothing store on the wrong side
of the tracks where i acquired a skimpy two-
piece suit and a cheap panama hat sweat-
stained beyond redemption but which would
probably still get by at a distance by moon-
light i was even able to pick up a small jar
of luminous greasepaint at a novelty shop in
the vicinity

  after that i spent the early evng at a
nearby pool room but as soon as it oegan to
get reasonably dark i headed back up the
tracks toward the beaumont place

  darkness was almost complete when i
reached the steep narrow path winding up the
face of the bluff there with the aid of a
mirror from my comb case i dabbed some of
the luminous paint on my face and hands
highlighting the hollows around my eyes and
mouth and making my fingers look longer
rtnd thinner than they were not too much-i
didnt want to give the effect of a halloween
masquerade

  then i climbed the path using the same post
id used before to get over the fence without
touching it on the far side i moved through
the trees for a final reconnaissance before

giving the signal which would bring tim
beaurrftint down here on the run as though
the devil himself were after him

t uck was with me the setting that night
was perfect for my experiment a thin
new moon rode the sky tossing a single star
between her horns and some change in the
atmosphere presaging storm had wreathed the
pool in wispy pockets of mist which reached
out to finger the boles of the nearest trees the
whole place was like some shadowy druid
glen with the rise and fall of cicada songs for
chorus and fireflies darting their yellow
torches through the miasma

  i paused a moment selecting a hiding place
then returned to the fence and pummelled the
top wire hard with my hat i didnt want him
to think it was just some stray branch dipping
in the breeze this time

  thirty seconds of that and i went back to
the pool i crouched immobile at its edge hid
my faintly glowing face and hands with my
coat sleeves and waited

  it wasnt two minutes till i heard him com-
ing across the meadow sliding and blowing
again he came to a stop on my side of the
knoll and swung the shotgun in a frenzied arc
hunting for something to shoot it at

  i pushed my hands up out of the mist and
started toward him as though id come from
the depths of the pool itself

  he screamed and fired his first shot his
voice had a hoarse animal timbre

  go back go back jeremy

  i kept coming not making a sound with my
hands hung out like hooks before me

  he began to back away into the trees stum-
bling and firing as he went when we were
less than ten yards apart the hammer clicked
dead on the empty chamber and a kind of
gagging came from his chest he flung the
gun at my head and dived for the fence

  he was up and over it like a monkey and
then one of his ankles touched that hot wire
at the top and he screamed and plunged head-
long into space

  i doubt if he even heard the outbound
freight rolling through the railroad cut be-
low i hadnt counted on that myself but
the result was inevitable anyway he could
never have survived that thirty-foot drop to
the tracks or the hangmans noose that would
have awaited him later if he had by some
miracle managed to pull through

  as it was he went rolling and tumbling
down the bluff like a sawdust doll and disap-
peared beneath the wheels of the last gondola
the train crew probably never even knew
about it

  i stood there staring through the fence
while the red lights of the caboose disap-
peared around the bend and i could feel the
the pool of fear



recurrent tremors shaking me id meant for
him to confess-not to die

  but after all it amounted to the same thing
in the last analysis

  at last i retraced my steps

again i sat by ellens bed while she
awakened and again the frightened be-
wilderment in her eyes gave way
steve oh steve im so glad youre back
does tim know 

  i let mv fingers close about her hand lie
back and try to relax i said gently theres
something i have to tell you ellen you may
not understand at first but when you do i
think itll clear up a lot of other things too
among them this illness

  i told her about tims death then dont
you see baby actually it was suicide
thats what well have to tell the police he
was really killed by his own conscience if
he hadnt murdered jeremy and hidden his
body in the pool he wouldnt have had such a
hobia about the place he wouldnt have for-
idden vou to go there or built that fence to
keep others out and he wouldnt have fallen
for that phony apparition which rose from
the mists to confront him there last night
subconsciously from the moment of the mur-
der he lived in mortal terror that some day
the dead would rise to haunt him

  but how-how could you know

  it was mostly a shot in the dark i admit-
ted but it hit the target but i learned
enough from you under hypnosis to fill in the
blanks it was your description of the way
jeremy was dressed that night that cued my
own disguise    from the moment you told
him in a burst of sisterly confidence that you
planned to marry jeremy he must have begun
to plot jeremys death your father had left
this place and the family interest in the mill
in your name and if you married your hus-
band would take over both

  he told you later that the mill was losing
money that thats why he had to take you out
of the sanatorium but if you hadnt been iso-
lated from the world so long youd have
known that  mill has lost money during the
past five years he told you that he couldnt
get servants to come here because of you
actually he wanted no servants he had to
keep you isolated the same applies to that
homecoming party he said he planned for you
actually no invitations were sent he
knew you were too proud to try to get in touch
with your former friends

  her eyes were wide and dark with shock
but how-how could he kill jeremy

  if you mean the mechanics of it that was
simple he talked you into holding the wed-
ding here and proposed that gag with the

shotgun but when jeremy met you at the
top of the path tim didnt merely emerge
from hiding and use the gun to marshal you
both to the house instead he used it to strike
jerry over the head killing him and later
with you in bed under sedatives and the
guests gone home he went back and weighted
the body with rocks and dumped it into the al-
most bottomless quarry hole

  and i-ive known all this all along
i nodded a little part of you knew it but
only a very small part buried deep in the
hidden substrata of your mind and it was the
conflict between this subconscious knowledge
and the secret hate it made you feel for tin-
set against your conscious image of him as a
loyal and devoted brother who deserved your
warmest affection that has caused all your
trouble  you see darling youre really
made of very tough emotional fibre other-
wise that conflict would have torn you to
pieces long ago as it was it found expression
only in your dream activity

  her head moved rebelliously on the pillow
but i couldnt forget a thing like jeremys
murder nothing could ever make me
yes i said there is one thing it lies
in your reaction to a certain drug there are
some persons whom this drug normally a sed-
ative does not put to sleep at once instead
they apparently remain conscious even lucid to
a degree but the drug aflects their memory
centers so that later after it has worn off
they cant consciously remember a thing that
happened while it was in effect    tim had
noticed your reaction to it earlier probably
it was given you as a sedative when your fa-
ther died so he gave you a dose in a drink
or something before you left the house to-
gether that night later your temporary am-
nesia could be explained as the result of the
traumatic shock brought about by your dis-
appointment at jeremys failure to appear
her eyes were alive now bright with re-
lief she had pulled through unbroken
steve she said softly kiss me steve
i could feel the blood pounding through my
temples but i shook my head

  i said shortly im still your doctor
and whats to become of me doctor
if youre smart youll take a nice long
trip and forget all this

  and you

  i looked away oh i-i suppose ill go
somewhere and try to re-establish a practice
you see all this-well damn it its sort of
given me a reason to go on living now too
she took my hand between hers and her
eyes were shining ill do it steve she
said ill do just what you said-on one con-
dition  that you make that trip you prescribed
a honeymoon

the end
the worm in the root

     suddenly a blast of flame
     blinded him

sandy graham adeptly whipped up
his breakfast of four scrambled eggs and
toast then hollered uncle deak a
couple times hopefully though it was no use
uncle deak hadnt been home since pa and
sandy returned from their trip a week ago

  sandy frowned he was worried yet he
shouldnt be really according to pa uncle
deak went off one time twenty years ago for
a day and stayed ten years sandy guessed
that was back hen his uncle was fat and
husky

  pa had already gone to the filling station
sandy looked for the time but the old clock
had stopped and pas watch which he most
always left at home was lost somewhere

  creeps he growled uncle deak not
being back meant hed have to dig the worms
another day he almost wished the fishermen
around lakewood would lay down their poles
for good

  garbed in his checked shirt blue jeans
and stetson hat that pa gave him on his
seventeenth birthday he meandered down to
the tool shed he removed the orders from
the hook got a lifting fork and an armful of
paper cartons like those that chili comes in
and went to number six bed on the far end


the worms there unmolested for a time
should be fattest and besides the earth was
hoved up loose as if the bed had recently
been worked over

  sandy looked off through the trees toward
the lake he could see the top of the mast
on mr townsends yacht and hear the cries
of the bathers sandy guessed it was nice to
have plenty of money

  he started digging one forkful at a time
and then removing the fat wriggling worms
from the pungent earth and placing them
carejjjruy in the cartons consulting his or-
ders- which people called in to pa at the fill-
ing station he counted the appropriate num-
ber into each carton before dropping moss
inside for the wriggling creatures to feed on

  creeps he cried-the deeper he went
the fatter the worms became he remained in
that one spot till his fork hit something solid
at first he thought hed hit the copper wire
which served as a bottom for the bed and
kept the worms from escaping but then he
leaned down and it wasnt the bottom at all

  golly he rammed the fork down again
pried up and then he went cold all over

  the object under his fork was a mans bare
leg sandy turned white he caught his
by ken kessler

breath before resolutely digging the earth
away from the recumbent form

  uncle deak he cried already decom-
position had blurred the thin features but
the shaggy grey head the narrow eyes the
lobeless ears were familiar there was a
hole the size of a dime in his temple

  sandy dropped the fork and jin for black
john mortons house a quarter mile up the
road where there was a phone black john
was sitting in the yard i found uncle
deaks body in the worm bed he shouted
black john stiffened rising at once sandy
dashed on into the house

  deesie morton was washing dishes she
had on a print dress and her yellow hair
which just missed matching sandys was
done in a knot that didnt seem too sure of
itself lernrne use thfe phone   sandy cried
deesie almost dropped a dish

  why sandy whats the-

  but sandy was cranking the phone he
asked the party line operator for the sheriff
first and then called pa pa hollered my
god and the receiver crashed down

  who-killed him sandy deesie burst
out

  i dont know and then he remembered
how uncle deak looked and you stay
here its no place for kids anyway girls

  stop calling me a child deesie snapped
im sixteen some girls marry no oldern
i am

  sandy didnt feel up to arguing with women
so he let her follow him black john was
already on the scene black john was deesies
pa and as peculiar a man as sandy ever
saw he was forever glum and mean looking
he and deesie had lived alone since her ma
died black john was retired he used to
be in the real estate and insurance business
in lakewood

  then the sheriff arrived and by the magic
wrought by the party line operator an assem-
blage of lakewood citizenry got there almost
as fast as pa who puffed up in the old jalopy

  cox bann the sheriff nodded to black
john and gazed a long time at the body
guess thats what youd call a mans sins
catching up with him cox was round
stubby and grey bearded but his eyes were
wise and cool

  pa bristled deak wasnt no model but

he was my brother he gazed levelly at
cox the lawd ought to learn to hold its
tongue

tthats how pa was sandy thought-loyal
- and good pa was the finest man he knew
anywhere and he was touchy about deak
he had a love for him that sandy never un-
derstood hed admit that deak was wild
even at fifty and he once said to sandy that
his uncle would end up bad yet

  whend you last see him asked bann
looking around at the two deputies and the
somber little coroner wlu-had just arrived

  well er-two weeks ago said pa the
sight of his brothers body upset him sandy
guessed me and sandy went upstate for
a week visitin when we come back deak
was gone

  by now twenty or thirty people had assem-
bled among them claude gray a lakewood
attorney that uncle deak went to see once
or twice sandy never knew what business
his uncle had with gray

gray addressing nobody in particular said
it might be of interest to note that deak
graham left harve quite a sum of money
pas eyes popped deak    left me   
money

  approximately twenty thousand dollars
gray said folding his hands so that his mani-
cure showed i was his lawyer

  twenty thousand- pa made a funny
sound with his lips you must be off your
nut deak never had twenty dollars

  what about his profits from the worm
business black john put in hoarsely

  he had more worms than business pa
snapped this questioning was making him
mad deak come and went i admit last
time he rolled in broke bout a year ago
he got the idea of selling fishing worms
not ordinary worms but lumbrious terrestris
specie he called em fat worms anyway
so he drawed up blue prints for the beds and
i let him use the land after that long
speech pa shut up tight

  bann stepped across the concrete border
around bed number five come off it harve
tellin us you dont know nothing about deak
having that much money

  i didnt pa snapped reddening under
the stare of the crowd

young sandy never knew when he dug for fishing
worms and turned ufa instead uncle deaks murdered
body that one good corpse deserves another




ken kessler

  some of the rich folks from the lake club
strode up gawking like anybody among
them was h phillip townsend owner of
the yacht marilynn which was named after
his daughter he wore white pants blue
coat yachting cap he nodded to the sheriff
and pa and looked very surprised when he
saw the body

  i wondered what had happened to him
mr townsend said hes been selling me
bait and i need some now

  the sheriff then asked both mr townsend
and black john of theyd seen anything pecu-
liar going on around the grahams property
lately they both said no it looks to me
bann said as if deak was shot at night
buried under cover of darkness here in the
worm bed-the idea being the worms would
consume the body by using this bed on the
far end the killer figured the body wouldnt
be disturbed

  he drew a breath that has a meanin
the killer knew this bed wasnt used much
bann looked at sandy son i see you in
town sometimes at night aint it possible
things could happen here that you wouldnt
know about say like when youre in a
movie

  sandy felt sick trapped he felt himself
turn white then he looked at pa yes-sir
but if you saying that pa might have done
it-

  i aint-yet bann cut him off then
as if he was thinking to himself he said
deak mightve got the money on one of
his trips he was mysterious but where
he got it dont matter right now the main
thing is finding the gun

  the deputies scattered out looking in the
weeds in the back lot and mr townsend
kicked around in the loose dirt turning up
fat worms the coroner and another man
loaded uncle deak into a basket and took
him off some of the crowd started drifting
away deesie whispered im sorry sandy
but you know they cant do anything with
your pa

  and just then mr townsend exclaimed
look here

  everybody regarded the end of mr town-
sends toe an object glinted against the
brown earth

  my watch pa exploded its been
missing for two weeks 

  bann picked it up by the chain sandy
didnt move nobody did it was like elec-
tricity in the air then bann said not
much arguing against this harve

  pa shrugged as if what had happened had
been building up right along before he left
he came over to sandy keep things going
at the house dont open up the station and
sandy- he put his big hand on sandys

  shoulder- dont go nosin into this it
murdert leave the nosin to the sherif
sandy watched them drive off in the sher-
iffs car cox bann looked pleased and pa
waved to sandy from down the road sandy
wouldve cried then except deesie came over
and put her hand in his

  i want to help you sandy

  like doing what

  like cooking for you maybe

  sandy squeezed her hand hed never
squeezed a girls hand before not just like
that anyway no deesie he strolled into
the house deesie following you better go
now i got thinking to do

  but deesie didnt go she accompanied him
into uncle deaks room on the wall was a
blue print of the worm beds showing the loca-
tion and size of each bed i helped him draw
the map deesie said because i took drawing
in school but i never saw that on there
what on where

  that x see that x on number four bed
sandy looked but he paid slight attention
uncle deak was always doing mysterious
things none of which ever meant much

  youre still imagining pirates and buried
treasure he said like when we used to
play down at the lake

  you liked me better then didnt you
sandy

  sandy didnt answer a big voice outside
the window shouted deesie come out of
there you got no business in that house
it was black john

  deesie said yes dad and whispered to
sandy dont mind dad none he dont like
anybody she tiptoed out so as not to intrude
on sandys thinking

oandy crossed through the living room
 neat and tidy as pa kept it since sandys
mother died and then he went outside he
decided not to bother with filling any worm
orders today he didnt feel up to it instead
he went on down into the woods he could
think straighter there he found an old limb
that was down and straddled it off by the
lake he heard music and a girls laughter

  nothing made sense or added up where
had uncle r ak got twenty thousand dollars
but since he had it why didnt pa know
or did he sandy felt disloyal over that
question and if pa lost his watch in the
worm bed wouldnt he remember about where
hed been and look for it there

  at first he hated cox bann for arresting
pa but he repented that now he had to look
at it as the sheriff did there was all the
evidence the motive and all and to bann pa
was just another man really sandy didnt
know much about murderers except what hed
read it gave him chills thinking that some-
the worm in the root



 body-somebody he knew probably-had
killed uncle deak

  noon came and sandy fixed himself some
corn flakes but he didnt feel like eating much
the afternoon was wearing away when he
started up the flivver and drove into lake-
wood first he got pa some cigars and then
cut around to the filling station that pad run
for ten years to see that it was leaked up tight
afterwards he went to the jail

  cox bann was in the front sandy con-
fronted him eyes bright ive been thinking
he said the coroner didnt say how long
uncle deakd been dead figure that out and
youll find pa was visiting

  cox bann chuckled it wasnt mentioned
because he cant tell about a decomposing
body mightve been six days maybe eight
sandy slumped he trudged on back to pas
cell pa was sitting on the edge of the bare
cot his chin down his face sort of gray he
made himself smile when sandy handed over
the cigars

  sandy said ive been going through uncle
deaks room-

  pa got purple in the face i aint whipped
you in ten years but god almighty son ill
skin you if you tangle up in this he ob-
served the shadows on sandys face set
he said softly pointing to the cot

  i dont want you hurt son he began
just between us uncle deak was mixed up
with bad company im purty sure and
theyre killers sandy they killed once would
agin see

  but youre locked up sandy protested
and cox bann will build a tight case

  no matter you stay out of it he
paused i reckon why deak come back last
time was because somethin was getting too
hot for him or he was running away from
somebody

  sandy leaned over he was my uncle
youre my pa you keep forgetting im grown
now i got a right to know such things

  this jolted pa as if he hadnt thought about
it before at length his eyes softened mebbe
youre right son he took a breath well
when deak come back i was in his room one
day i run onto a copy of a police record
hidden in his grip some man named harry
tolbert was wanted for killing a wealthy oil-
man near san francisco he got away ac-
cording to the record and after the wife col-
lected her share of the estate she disappeared
too the police are looking for both parties
pa gazed off you know who i think
harry tolbert was

  sandy shook his head hed never seen pa
so solemn

  uncle deak or one of his cronies under
a changed name especially since this money
turns up

  he might have    killed the man then

the woman

  i dont know what to think he got up
son i want you to promise me youll not-
at that moment claude gray treading so
lightly that neither heard him coming ap-
peared in front of the cell

   i brought a copy of the will thought youd
like to see it gray said sandy slipped out
before pa could make him promise anything

  darkness had settled down when sandy got
home he saw a light on in deesies room
the rest of the morton house was dark sandy
wondered where black john was deesie
wouldnt be afraid alone however when she
and sandy used to play pirates deesied make
a canoe landii-only it was a frigate to them
-and come clear through the woods at night

   a big affair was going on at the lake sandy
saw a log burning and heard music he kept
thinking of pa-maybe in the electric chair
and to banish the thought he strolled down to
the water the rich folks were dancing on the
pier sleek gowned women and men in dinner
clothes

  h phillip townsend was on the rim of the
group leaning against a tree he was wearing
a white coat dark pants and white gloves
sandy tried to imagine what pa or black john
would look like wearing fancy gloves

  townsend jumped when sandy went over
you startled me he said im sorry about
your uncle and the unfortunate circumstances
that brought on your fathers arrest

  it wasnt your fault really sandy said
digging his toe in the soft earth

  murder is serious if your father isnt
guilty hell be exonerated at a fair trial and
if he did-

  dont say that sandy burst out no
matter what happens pa didnt do it

   the music ended and the dancers strolled off
the pier townsends eyes followed them ill
miss your unce bought bait from him you
know talked a lot about his worms being tne
best in the country he chuckled which
i doubted his worms were like himself fat
and lazy

a slim girl about sandys age in a dress
cut lower than sandy had ever seen be-
fore joined them my daughter marilynn
mr townsend said and with a wink at sandy
drifted away

  ive heard about you marilynn said her
dark hair was upswept and her lips deeply
crimson youre the worms mans nephew
uncomfortably sandy said yesm
well i hate your old worms i hate it
here the firelight cast shadows on her
cheeks

  your ma and pa like it sandy reminded
her


ken kessler

  mothex- doesnt she came because phil
thinks theres no place else to fish as if there
isnt the whole atlantic coast- her eyes
misted-places with swanky club houses and
naval officers 

  i think youre spoiled sandy said simply

  she stepped closer to him her lips parted
in a way deesies never did im sorry you
feel that way i could like you

  sandy flushed i-i got to go he stam-
mered g-good night he was twenty feet
away when he heard her giggle

  but sandy was very thoughtful as he
strolled back to the house it startled him
when he saw a shadow ahead he slipped be-
hind some tall brambles waiting breathlessly
finally the shadow moved on and he recog-
nized black john he watched as the old man
threaded toward his house

  when finally he flung himself across the bed
fully dressed except for his shoes it was late
but he couldnt sleep all the factors were
present he realized vaguely but he couldnt
put them together somehow and then he got
to thinking about pa in jail alone then a
vision of uncle deaks body returned and
sandy shivered

  it scared him when he heard a scraping
sound in the vicinity of unlle deaks room
he jerked upright the sound came again
eerily hed never thought much about ghosts
but now he wasnt so sure covered with net-
tles he eased off the bed and bare-footed pad-
ded through the living room toward the sound

  he was almost there when he bumped a
stool he leaped back the unexpected fright-
ening him it took a lot of nerve but he went
on and flung the door open snapping on the
lights

  the room was silent but one window was
up mute evidence that somebody not a ghost
had been there the curtains stirred weirdly
from the outside breeze

  sandy brushed a hand through his yellow
hair fighting down an impulse to clear out
then his eye rested on the blue print on the
wall on the x on number four bed that deesie
had pointed out now that things were tak-
ing shape in his mind the x came to mean
something just what sandy wasnt sure but
he was having an idea

  bolstering his nerve he went for a flash
light and then slipped out into the night he
didnt turn on the light however he crawled
against the ground to the tool shed where he
groped for a spade still crawling dragging
the implement he worked his way to number
four bed

  it was a moonless night but the sky was
clear the mounded earth where uncle deaks
body had been excavated was ominously near
him sandy lay on his belly and dug he
could only guess at the exact location of the

x on the map but it looked about two feet out
frotfi the northeast corner the spade crunched
against the damp earth worms crawled
against sandys bare feet-cold slimey crea-
tures he had the feeling that somebody was
watching him his spine tingled

  he dug down about eighteen inches before
the spade touched metal the screech of it
chilled him exploring with his fingers he
touched the top of a box -he used his fingers
as a fork and dug the earth away the box
was metal the kind a mechanic uses for carry-
ing tools he lifted it out the lid was sealed
with wax to keep out moisture

  deserting the spade sandy crawled back to
the tool shed with the box in tow the feel-
ing that unseen eyes were following him per-
sisted he gained the shed squatted in front
of the door and reaching a screwdriver off
the rack inside pried away the wax the lid
open he removed an oilskin cloth which was
wrapped around a heavy object beneath the
oilskin was a chamois sandys eyes popped

  uncovered the object was a gleaming 
revolver sandy rewrapped it carefully and
returned it to the box

  instantly a hign tortured scream penetrated
the stillness deesies voice sandy flung
himself down a blast of flame blinded him
sandy lay there listening not breathing
thudding footfalls retreated across the yard
that would be deesie but where was his as-
sailant 

  sandys heart pounded indian-style he
crawled on his belly around the shack sud-
denly he could see the shadow of a figure
stealthily advancing toward the shed it struck
sandy that the mail figured hed hit him
sandy wished he dared use the  but that
was out the gun meant something that han-
dling might obliterate he edged farther drag-
ging in the dirt

 the shadow came nearer but still sandy
couldnt see who it was although he was
pretty sure he knew moreover he knew why
it was who it was-all useless information if
he didnt live to use it to free pa and the
man was desperate or else hed have run when
deesie screamed

  i reckon he knows deesie wasnt close
enough to see him good sandy thought
grimly whivh meant the killer was free to
finish the jobt andy figured now hed have
done better to hang onto the revolver evi-
dence or not

tthe figure neared the shed doo sandy
considered rising running but even in the
darkness it was a big gamble if the man gave
pursuit so he waited a plan forming in his
mind when the figure stooped over the metal 
box sandy leaped up he charged the shed
door
the worm in the root



  the man heard him straightened abruptly
why you little-

  driving hard sandy hi he door before the
man could fire anger mplaced fear he
heard a groan the figure hurtled into the
shed sandy slammed the door swiftly insert-
ing the lock in the hasp there was wild
cursing within

  frame pa will ya sandy cried triumph-
antly just then a shot ripped through the
door sandy spun falling backwards a tin-
gling besieged his shoulder he touched his
flesh blood on his hand warm sticky he
was fighting back nausea when another shot
from within the shed blasted loose the hasp
the door was swinging outward as sandy
losing his fight swam away on the wide
soaring wings of the metal box just outside
the door   

  sheriff bann deesie black john and h
phillip townsend were in the room it was
sandys bedroom and he was on the bed dr
ormsby from lakewood was inserting a
needle in sandys arm

  sandy looked up at the sheriff i-i was
just going to call you- he blinked choking
-no he was escaping out the door
deesie called me said the sheriff and
he didnt escape black john had a change of
heart he finally did somebody a good turn
black john did

  it was deesies doins said black john
grudgingly

  deesie touched the bed hed been out
walking down by the lake i couldnt sleep
and i started over this way when i saw you
and the man drawing the gun i ran for dad
and he stopped him she viewed her father
with pride now hes going to stop being so
grouchy and selfish he promised me just
now

  black john surveyed his daughter and al-
most smiled

 townsends cuffed sandy said bann
you done a nice piece of work and were
proud of you

  sandy raised up townsend was scowling
his smooth face a mask hes not town-
send said sandy knowingly hes harry
tolbert

  harry tolbert

  sandy told him about the police record pa
read pa wont like me telling about uncle
deak but creeps i think he was blackmail-
ing towns-tolbert thats where he got the
twenty thousand uncle deak had the murder
gun all wrapped up so the fingerprints
wouldnt rub off he related the episode of
finding the gun and ill bet a bullet from
it will match the one that killed the rich oil
man i dont know how uncle deak got it

but mr townsendll tell you    ask him

  but mr townsend wasnt talking well
get it later bann said confidentially you
figure he came here pretending to fish in
order to kill deak i guess his wife is the san
francisco woman

  and marilynn is her daughter but not
townsends she called him phil not pa or
dad

  i see bann smiled funny come to
think of it how he uncovered your pas watch
when none of the rest of us saw it

  thats what started me thinking a win-
dow was loose in uncle deaks room while
we were all away he climbed in stole the
watch planning to use it to frame pa when
pa and i went visiting he killed uncle deak
thinking he would locate the gun later but
he couldnt find it he was desperate all
rightj tonight when he thought i was asleep
he came back to search some more he felt
weak again

  i connected them up when mr townsend
called uncle deak fat and lazy at the land-
ing tonight uncle used to be fat when i
was a kid but he got thin tonwsend had
past and present mixed up another thing
he was wearing gloves i reckon his hands
were blistered from digging uncle deaks
grave

  townsend seized that moment to plunge to-
ward the window black john moving faster
than sandy had ever seen him knocked the
handcuffed man down the sheriff grabbed
him

  dr ormsby said rest now sandy youre
overdoing it

  sandy did feel dopey he asked for pa
ive sent a deputy for him bann said a
moment later they drove up

  pa came in big and powerful looking his
head high then he was holding sandy in
his arms like when he was a kid and a storm
scared him your uncle was a strange man
staying on here when he was rich in his
queer way maybe he thought he was helping
us making that will and all the money being
unclean didnt bother him none guess though
hed have gone off some day again like he did
before

  the money is yours now pa sandy said
wonderingly

  the lawll probably take it anyway its
not for us he pondered i been thinkin
mebbe bloods thicker than water but wrongs
wrong

  the room blurred sandy was sinking away
when he felt a drop of moisture on his face
it was out of pas eyes my-son- thats
all he could say right then sandy fell asleep
with pa holding him and deesies face swim-
ming over the bed
the white square

by everett m webber

it was a raw cloudy day-coming dark
and dirk expected to find his uncle cook-
ing supper or eating it but the little
windows of the house showed no light as he
stopped the buckboard then dirk saw his
uncle mac down below the corral working on
the earthen dam of his pond he had evidently
heard the buckboard for he straightened slow-
ly one hand at the small of his back the other
still holding the shovel

  dirks heart beat a little fast with a mixture
of apprehension excitement and something a
little like fear there was also a tinge of
shame mingled with his feeling at being here
begging again but none of that must show

  he waved at the old man clambered down
and swiftly unhooked the horse easing the
collar a bit and roughing the wet hair under
it he tied the animal to the porch post and
then seeing that his uncle wasnt coming up
to greet him he walked down toward the pond
careful to close the gates behind him bluffly
above the croaking of frogs and the blatting
of sheep he exclaimed hello there uncle
mac you look younger every time i see
you 

  and as he clambered the grassed-over dam
and shook hands with the old man he saw
that his uncle knew he was here again for
money

  sweating old mac said well i dont feel
any younger lad    guess ive done about
enough here just fixing the dam a little
against the rain well go to the house throw
your horse in the corral and feed im an well
eat supper youre in money trouble again

  the words graveled dirk but they gave him
a sort of relief too at having the reason for
his trip brought up well not exactly trou-
ble he said but i am needing another
loan 

  old mac grunted dourly squinting at the
heavens as the wind became suddenly dank
and then before they reached the house a
fine drizzle set in

  youll bear in mind he stated as dirk
presently untied the horse to lead him to the
corral you havent paid the other four loans
and like ive told you over and over i cant
let you have any more till im paid but
youre welcome to stay the night or longer
  

  it was only gradually after supper that
dirk brought the matter up again it was
sprinkling rather steadily now and as old


mac opened the door to let the extra heat from
the fire go outside the buckboard glistened
in the lamp light and the bare earth of the
yard shined wetly a night hawk zipped past
the door and away

  the fact is dirk said as casually as he
could ive had tough luck at cards and i
promised to pay up in a hurry five hundred
would hold them off

  old mac turned from the doorway and
stared at dirk who still sat at the table and
dirk saw that his little eyes were troubled
as he shook his grizzling head

  dirk swallowed the black anger that rose
within him and then theentire story was tum-
bling from his lips and he couldnt hold it
back how he had had to beg like a dog to get
a few days grace to drive the sixty miles over
here across wild prairie to try to raise a little
cash how if he didnt get it he wouldnt
dare go back for fear of his very life and how
the men he owed would hog up his land the
well he had dug and the few cows he still
had left

  but still his uncle shook his head i cant
do it dirk im an old man i cant work
forever

  you could live with me you could sell
out and get away from this god-forsaken
place 

  and come to a place where someone else
is owner a place youll gamble away any day 
and this isnt so god-forsaken its only four
miles from town ive got friends its not
that i want to hurt your feelings nor-

  but like you say dirk reasoned des-
perately all youve got will be mine some
da

  i couldnt live in another mans house and
thats whatll happen if i keep giving-

  with a sudden angry oath dirk came out
of his chair jerking at the revolver in the
waistband under his coat the old man stood
paralyzed a second there by the door and in
that second dirk was upon him firing almost
in his face old mac tottered to a chair col-
lapsed across the back of it and then sprawled
to the floor with it half upon him he didnt
move after that but a few dops of blood
trickled down onto th vide clean boards

  dirk stood there stlring down at him his
heart thundering furiously and ihen half
aloud he panted the pennypinching old
varmint-it serves him right

  he put the gun back into his waistband and
frugal uncle macs idea was never to send good money after
bad and so be swore hed rather be dead before he lent
dirk another cent    which was exactly dirks idea tool

stood listening lest there might have been
someone who heard or saw the shooting
when there seemed to be no one he quickly
losed the door the shades were already
irawn at the fireplace he worked out the
-ight hand corner stone of the hearth and
hrust his hand into the hole

a short sharp cry burst from his lips it
 was empty frantically he leaned low to
eer into it and then he brought up a slip of
laper the red printing at the top said bank
if boiling springs and under that de-
osit receipt dirk stared with blurring eyes
t the firm pale writing under that silver
 currency  gold  it
dded up to 

  dirk licked his dry lips the slip was dated
 scant two weeks before he put it back into
he hole and replaced the stone and rose

 the dirty old varmint  he growled his
eart was slowing now and he forced him-

self to steadiness as he rose banking it-
now i cant touch a dime the anger some-
how restored him

  but it was his he was old macs only kin
it was all his and this little ranch which he
could sell for good cash he wouldnt go back
home let them take his few cattle and his
shack why with cash like this what couldnt
he do he would go to some city-maybe
denver or san francisco liquor-women
m fine clothes-new cars-good horses   
set himself up in a nice saloon in a good part
of town buy railroad stock and run his
money up   

  his enthusiasm suddenly cooled first he
must get the money and he must avoid get-
ting himself into trouble for what he had done
maybe it would be best to get on back home
and wait to be advised that old mac had tossed
in his chips on the other hand it was known
there that he had come here-and besides
that infernal buckboard would leave tracks

clear across the country the way it was
sprinkling

   dirk began sweating as he stood in the
 middle of the floor racking his brains for a
 notion of what to do first off he guessed he
 should get rid of the gun and after that
 drive to town and report that he had come to
 see his uncle mac and found him murdered
 maybe they would suspect him but what could
 they prove  nothing all they could do after
 the funeral was to hand him the money

   he reached for his dusty old hat and jumper
 and put them on the drilled well six inches
 in diameter and two hundred feet deep would
 be a fine place for the pistol and in the pitch
 blackness of the yard dirk found the little well
 shed he raised the cover and dropped the
 gun in and heard it scrape and bang the casing
 several times before it struck the water

   the rain was coming harder now already
 soaking him through at knee and shoulder as
 he headed for the corral stooping low he
 could faintly see his hammerheaded old horse
 against the skyline his eyes were getting
 used to the dark he caught the animal by the
 mane and led him up by the barn and brought
 the harness out and threw it on the leather
 was wet and slick as he fastened the buckles

   it was as he reached under for the belly
 band that he heard the pound of hoofs and
 then the rattle of a buggy and for an instant
 he leaned there paralyzed whoever it was
 would be coming here for no one else lived
 down this way suddenly he grabbed the
 bellyband and buckled it and caught the bit
 ring let them come give him three more
 minutes and let them come-

   he led the horse out of the corral and flung
 himself upon its back and rode him swiftly
 to the yard and slid down in a second he had
 backed him into the shafts and was fastening
 them he hooked a tug then with the sound
 of the horse and buggy coming closer and
 ran around to hook the other and as he undid
 the lines from the liame he could see the mov-
 ing blackness of the rig coming at him swift-
 ly he clambered to the seat

   the rig pulled up a man said hello
 there that aint you is it mac

   dirk knew the voice old man vanderwet
 then some other man said mac

   dirk got a good grip on his voice its
 me he said dirk callen uncle-uncle
 mac-has been killed-

   vanderwet exclaimed i told you i told
 you something was wrong  and as the two
 men piled out of the rig he added every
 friday night for twenty years weve played
 checkers and when he didnt show up tonight
 -i-i knew something must be wrong so i
 brought the doctor-

   startled dirk kept quiet as he stepped from
 hub to porch he had forgotten it was friday

 maybe in the excitement of their talk h
 uncle had forgotten it too

   the rain beat down with sudden fury as h
 shoved the door open and let the yellow ligv
 flood out that was fine it would smoot
 out the tracks he had made getting the hors
 up here from the barn he led the way i
 and stood silently as vanderwet moved pon
 derously behind him vanderwet looked at th
 body for a long time face shaken and pale an
 his grey mustaches trembling a little now an
 then the doctor a little man in baggy clothe
 whom dirk did not know knelt by old ma
 and took his wrist

   and in surprise he exclaimed why he
 only just been shot i

   dirk tensed he-hes dead isnt he
   theres no doubt of it

   i heard the shot dirk explained
 drove up just before you got here i wasn
 quite to the gate when i thought i heard 
 gun and when i came inside this is what i
 saw

   the doctor said somebody evidently at
 supper with mac

   they must have taken out the back way
 dirk declared when they heard me

  but why vanderwet exclaimed why
would anybody-

 ije fixed a long searching look on dirk
 his little grey eyes peering out above
 bustles of grey flesh his brows glistening a
 little with drops of mist dirk forced himself
 to keep a steady countenance

   you werent by any chance the one who
 ate here the old man asked and his look
 moved to dirks shirt front and back up to his
 eyes

   in spite of himself dirk glanced down and
 saw the streak of egg yoke down his belly
 he felt sweat break upon his body i  i
 didnt mean to mention it he said but-
 well i was starved when i came in uncle
 mac was dead past help they had left a
 little stuff he and whoever ate with him and
 being hungry i bolted it down and started for
 you

  vanderwet nodded then you-you must
have got here say ten minutes ago fifteen
maybe

   maybe fifteen

   vanderwet said how long has mac been
 dead doc

   the doctor shrugged who can say five
 minutes-ten minutes-maybe a quarter of an
 hour not longer

   i told you i heard the shot dirk ex-
 claimed with an effort he toned his voice
 down i heard it

   vanderwet sighed heavily and picked up
 the lamp ill hold the light for you to turn 
 around doc have john and them bring out
the white square

the very best coffin-that all right dirk

  sure dirk was getting a little dizzy with
relief sure the best

  well lay him out an shave him while
youre gone vanderwet added he led the
way onto the porch and stood there a second
and then he whirled on dirk drawing a gun
from his armpit he cocked it holding it un-
waveringly on dirks middle

  i would enjoy shooting you he said as
dirk backed toward the table in the room i
hope you move one more step he came in
with the lamp squinting his left eye against
it find his pistol doc and tie his hands
behind him    and dont get between me
and him

  dirk tried to speak as the doctor moved
behind him and felt over his body for a gun
but no words would come he calculated his
chances for a break they were nil then it
came to him that he must brazen it out old
vanderwet was merely suspicious and trying
to stampede him into talking

  all right find my gun he said since
i never owned one of the things id like to
see it

  the doctors hands moved quickly and ex-
pertly over him a second time and finally the
man grunted well theres no gun thats
sure

  tie him vanderwet exclaimed out of
his own mouth gun or not he stands con-
victed theres a rawhide lace on the nail be-
hind you doc put your hands behind you
callan

dirk obeyed before the cold hungry mouth
of the pistol his sweat had dried but-you

see i have no gun- he croaked his mouth
growing dry

  ill see something else before snow flies
a hanging

  dirk felt the rawhide bite into his wrists
and the doctors warm breath blowing upon
his hands

  then vanderwet backed onto the porch
again the lamp throwing heavy angles of
shadow into the room come out he or-
dered doc pick up that poker and if he
tries anything brain him

  something in the mans manner in his
voice struck an icier terror into dirk than he
had ever felt before his knees wobbled as
he moved out onto the porch and it was hard
for him to breathe but he would think of
something yet he would admit nothing to
them

  youve been here fifteen minutes you say
and its been raining upwards of an hour the
ground is muddy the road full of puddles
vanderwet took a deep breath pointing and
yet-

  at first dirk thought he was pointing at
the buckboard and he stared at it dripping
and shining but he could see nothing wrong
and the horse standing dejectedly looked all
right

  look under it vanderwet grunted and
the doctor gave a sudden cry of understand-
ing take a look under the buckboard
callan

  dirk looked the ground there hadnt been
rained on it was dry and white a white
square of it in the lamp light the size of a
gallows floor

rick haines was a master craftsman
he admitted it he also admitted to the
cleverest brain in the profession the
police hadnt a thing on him because he always
planned his jobs well and his plans always
worked because they were simple and direct

  he came briskly down the hall a tall well-

to do and what to expect when at noon he
walked into the fourth-floor office of acme

the body out of sight behind a desk then he
pulled off the big black-lensed glasses that
were an effective disguise for his small shrewd
eyes laid his gray fedora on top of them on
the desk and went to the unlocked safe where
he swiftly and efficiently transferred its more
cheering assets to the briefcase he turned to

a easy kill

way he had come when he froze in amazed
disbelief-standing in the open doorway
watching him was a woman she just stood
there with her hand on the knob a stout
middle-aged woman with gray hair under a
little pertly styled bonnet and blue eyes be-
hind rimless glasses she was looking at him
her lips parted a little in surprise as though
she had expected to find someone else there

  at the sight of her standing there like that
his well-oiled plans deserted him he hadnt
even remotely considered a chance intrusion
his first wild blind impulse was to flee to
shoot his way out but his clever high-speed
brain kept him from making such a fool mis-
take he reasoned shes just standing there
not yelling her head off so she just thinks
i belong here ill get her inside let her have
it and- he came toward her smiling bow-
ing politely

  come in madam he invited heartily
we are-

  for a moment longer she just stood there
watching him like a hypnotized bird shifting
her bulk uneasily trying to see past him into
the office she brought her hands up in a little
gesture as if to make a sign then suddenly
turned and fled

  wait rick shouted after her but she
scurried away and was gone before he could
grab her he cursed loud and luridly-she was
on to him he had to catch her and kill her
before she got away she was a living com-
petent witness who had had plenty of time
to memorize his face

  he had the presence of mind to slap his hat
on his head hook his dark glasses on his long
nose and grab the briefcase before he dashed
down the hall after her but the pause had
given her time to disappear he heard the
elevator doors clang shut and the car was just
dropping out of sight-he knew his ticket to
the chair was on it

  he took the stairs in amazing long-legged
strides almost dropping straight down them
at the street floor he compelled himself to
pause a moment then go swiftly but sanely
through the door into the foyer the elevator
car was loading for another ascent ahead of
him waddling desperately for the street was
the fat slob who could put the finger on him

  panic caught at him again he had to stop
her had to it was all he could do to keep
from shouting at her to stop he actually
started to pull the gun from his pocket to shoot
her as she drove ahead through the crojyded
foyer she paused once as she came abreast
the line of telephone booths and rick

thought here it is shes calling the cops
where i cant stop her here in front of this
mob but she went on and he guessed with-
out looking that the phones were all busy

  but it was a brief respite at best a few
more steps and shed be on the street yelling
her head off for a cop back in his brain
something seemed wrong for why hadnt she
given the alarm before this to the elevator op-
erator or someone his quick mind had the
answer she was a woman scared silly and she
was beating it for a place of refuge-her home
probably shed keep her tongue in silence un-
til she could contact someone she trusted-her
old man likely

  she lumbered out onto the street paused a
moment while rick panicky in his fear and
uncertainty weighed his chances of plugging
her right here and running for it or tailing
her he had no choice while he hesitated she
popped into a waiting cab and was off down
the street

  he had a bad few seconds as he got his car
out into traffic but the drizzling misty rain
helped him the cabby was a cautious soul and
rick caught up with him two blocks down he
kept close as they threaded through traffic his
eyes glued onto the back glass of the cab
where he could see her huddled and staring
back at him repeatedly in her terror

  he smashed the steering wheel a savage
blow with his fist and let his rage run free
the stinking idiot he snarled aloud i
ought to have killed her right there in the
office then i wouldnt have to chase her a
couple miles to do it

  they came out onto the wide boulevard
and the cab speeded up but rick drove care-
fully just keeping his quarry in sight he
didnt want to be picked up now the rain
beat steadily against the windshield the
sedate whir of the wiper was company for his
thoughts his master mind was already busily
at work planning and as it worked his rage
vanished and his confidence returned he could
handle this job-easy hed been right back
there-she was holing up somewhere to wait
a chance to spill what shed seen after she got
over her terror and she wouldnt expect the
killer to trail her clean out here in the sub-
urbs  shed figure he was already on the lam
which was ok for rick haines

  the cab swung-off the boulevard went
down a quiet tree-aisled street lined on both
sides by big box-like houses set back from the
sidewalk behind a narrow strip of lawn rick
swung in parked the stolen green chevvy and
watched intently the cab pulled up to the curb




william hellman

half-way down the street the woman got out
scurried up the walk onto the wide porch in
the half-murk rick watched intently and
when she used a key instead of ringing the
bell he laughed in pleased confidence for it
meant he had guessed aright-shed be alone

  he clambered over the seat back lifted tne
rear cushion and slid the briefcase back under
a mess of papers and old rags he had placed
there he waited a while then drove boldly
down and parked before the house he got
out swung briskly up the flagstone walk
across the porch and punched the button he
didnt hear the sound of the bell within so he
punched the button again peering through the
curtained glass and he saw a little light flash
off and on somewhere inside in response to his
fingered pressure his lip curled in derision-
of all the silly stunts so the big fools nerves
were too bad to stand the clatter of a bell eh 

  he never had a doubt that his surmise was
correct that she would answer his summons
he waited until she opened the door stood
looking at him enquiringly then he whipped
off the black glasses she gasped in surprise
her eyes amazed her hands came up in a
gesture again and before she had the wit to
close the door on him it was too late he was
in the hall the door closed the little gun
jammed deep against her soft bulging middle

  her eyes were big pools of surprised terror

  not a peep he warned savagely so
you do recognize me you blundering idiot
well youll never live to tell it 

  she was paralyzed in her horror trying
desperately to back away from him her fingers
twisting helplessly at her mouth from which
no words would come he pushed the little
gun deeper under her sagging breast fired
twice the bullets slanting up and to the right
her clutching fingers clawed at her mouth and
face in a gripping spasm of pain and terror
she swayed then crumpled without a sound

  rick froze crouching over her listening-
the gun ready in his hand but no other sound
came to him except somewhere the slow
ponderous ticking of a clock the shots had
made a small noise like the snapping of a
pencil and perhaps there was someone else in
another room he couldnt wait to find out
cautiously he investigated and found no one
and relaxed with a grin

  swiftly he executed the rest of his light-
ning plan he ransacked the house turning out
drawers and cupboards indiscriminately spill-
ing their contents in confusion garnering
items of value into a pillow slip

  he came downstairs dropped the sack of
loot with a clatter on the kitchen floor near
the rear exit he unlocked the door leaving
it partly open and dropped the little gun near-
by he allowed himself a moment to grin in
self-appreciation of his cleverness the dumb

police would lay the crime to a prowler who
had killed the woman ransacked the house
then had been frightened into dropping his
loot and escaping out the back door the little
gun could be easily traced to a small-time
misshappen snowbird with a long record

  he went back through the hall to where the
woman still lay a lumpy sprawling heap he
peered out into the street through the cur-
tain the rain had stopped it was wholly de-
serted and gray in the murky half-light he
put on his glasses paused went over and de-
liberately kicked the woman in the face
laughed and opened the door

  he was half-way through it when he halted
stunned-a man was coming toward him on
the sidewalk not ten feet from the flagstone
walk a car was parked a little distance be-
hind the chewy instantly rick realized
what had happened he hadnt noticed the
other car parked by the trees when he had
looked out the curtains and when he had gone
back to kick the woman the man had got
out of it who was he but more important
where was he going- rick haines wanted
desperately to duck back into the house but it
was too late the man had seen him

  his master mind came-promptly to his res-
cue he paused as though listening to the
woman past the edge of the partly open door
said distinctly thank you again mrs
anderson  he almost grinned at the name he
had noticed it on a small plate on her mailbox
he stepped out onto the porch his hand on the
knob holding the door several inches ajar i
really am sorry  he paused politely to
let her speak stood-listening and nodding
aware that the little man on the sidewalk had
slowed was looking at him curiously rick
ignored him yes  i understand  be-
lieve me im sorry too well he laughed
ruefully guess ill have to ask elsewhere
but thank you again and goodbye he added
gallantly and closed the door behind him 
knowing that the spring lock would work

  the little guy on the sidewalk was still look-
ing at him walking slowly and a sudden rage
flared up in rick haines and he swore silently
that hed be damned if hed leave a witness
this time no matter how remote the chances
of being identified nor how involved the i
task of bumping him off he had cleverly and
effectively -lulled any suspicions the lug may
have had as to his business here and now to
get him into the chewy and the rest would
be easy and in his pocket a gun which he
had a license to carry because of his apparent
lawful profession would be enough persuasion
this buzzo was going to die

  he stopped the little man with a word
what a skinny innocent-looking worm can
you please tell me where j e thalmus lives
hereabouts he asked politely mrs ander- 
easy kill



son tells me she never heard of him at all
the little mans eye brows went up just a
twitch mrs anderson said that now that
is strange-i mean she has lived here all her
life and gets about a lot and knows every soul
on this quiet little street shes a nice woman
mrs anderson kind and quiet-spoken
you know her rick asked and a little
alarm bell tinkled back in his brain somewhere
yes she is who is this lousy little runt
anyway  have i seen him some place before 
his hand went rigid hard on the gun in his
pocket he was aware of the little guys stare
of his quick glance at the bulging hand in his
pocket he laughed well i guess ill have
to go back for a better address

  he moved a little looking about to see if any
chance window-watcher might see him force
the little mug into the chewy then the pee-
wee surprised him

  look he said suddenly in a sort of des-
perate choked voice would you give me a
lift downtown he laughed ruefully that
blasted skate of mine there quit on me up the
street and i coasted to here 

  sure sure rick agreed heartily glad
to have you his heart was singing now-
boy what a break a solid hard whack on the
buzzos neck then drive out along the high-
way open the door on that curve and let the
body spill out over the bank in the dark and
into the river below as simple as that-and
the little runt asking for it

  they came down off the quiet tree-lined
street onto the boulevard lanes then turned
west there were plenty of places along here
where he could knock the little guy out before
they got into the congested district where
traffic was heavy hed take it slow   

  at an intersection a cop stood in the re-
newed drizzle directing cross-traffic rick
slowed the car to the required twenty-five he
was too smart to slip up now but as they ap-
proached the officer the little man suddenly
caught at the steering wheel with both hands
heaved with all his puny might his might
was as little as his body but the maneuver
caught rick off guard because it was totally
unexpected before his amazed senses could
react properly the wheel spun in his relaxed
hands the car swerved and plowed with a
rending crash into an iron trolley pole

  the impact dazed him for a moment he
couldnt move but the little man had the door
open was out on the street the cop came
over angry and bawling

  watch that man the little fellow
shrilled hes dangerous he just killed mrs
john anderson because he thought she saw
him kill my cashier

  my cashier  rick heard the words and went
numb-so he had seen the mug before-when

he had cased the joint he started up but the
cop was beside him the door open his big
service pistol in his mitt that cop wasnt a
coward but he wasnt a fool either

come out of there fellow he said stolidly
cold terror revived rick haines hes a
fool he said furiously the jackass asked
me for a lift wrecked my car im a salesman
and i called on mrs anderson on businessv

  yes the little man cut in dancing in his
excitement look officer i returned from
lunch found my man dead the safe looted i
remembered that this is the day of the month
that poor kelly stayed to attend to mrs
anderson she always came at noon when
everyone else was out-you see officer she
was sort of sensitive about her-her ailment
and kelly was the only one she would con-
verse with she came today stumbled on this
guy tapping the till didnt see poor kelly and
left because she was unwilling to deal with
anyone else i dont believe she had any idea
at all that this thug had killed but-

  you libelous little fool rick ranted he
kept his senses by reminding himself that they
couldnt pin a thing on him sure theyd find
her dead but this runt himself would have to
admit she was still alive when they left her
i never harmed your man nor mrs ander-
son you heard me talking to her when i-
yes the little man said again he grinned
suddenly thats what put me next to you
warned me you were a phoney with something
to hide i came out to talk to mrs anderson
because she-well she cant use the phone i
saw you come out got a little suspicious but
id have to let you go unnoticed-if you hadnt
stopped to talk to her the rest i added up
and when i saw that gun in your fist in your
pocket i was sure i was sure too that the
car was stolen so i deliberately got you to
give me alift so i could-

  youre a fool rick snarled but some-
thing in the little mans grin put terror in his
soul mrs anderson was alive when i left
her i talked to her-

  sure but she didnt talk back she didnt
because she couldnt thats why she used a
door-light instead of a bell-that should have
tipped you off if you saw it and thats why
kelly alone could talk to her he alone could
talk with his hands you see wise guy mrs
anderson did not talk to you because she was
a deaf mute born deaf and dumb 

  ricks panic possessed him completely then
he forgot everything even his gun in his lust
for life he swung around the car raced in
agony for the shielding corner and escape
the policemans bullet sliattered his leg drop-
ping him screaming to the street

  wise guy the little man said just a
death house dummy
red dawn

by don james



god knows larry had reason enough
to wish pete lundquist dead but
when someone beat him to that ugly
job of murder larry became it in
a deadly game of hot-squat tag

larry halder gulped the last of the
hot coffee he had made and looked at the
clock it was twenty-seven minutes after
three and outside the night still was dark and
cold the bus passed the corner at three thirty-
four hed have to hurry

  quietly he rinsed the cup and put it away
he didnt want to awaken mildred she hadnt
spoken to him for three days-since their last
quarrel-and if he awakened her now she
would probably go into a tirade about the split
shifts he worked the relatively low salary he
earned and what she thought of marriage to
a news man who worked for a press bureau

  he got into a top coat put on his rain-bat-
tered hat and left the house he had to run
the three blocks to the bus line

  several passengers looked at him casually
and settled back into early morning expres-
sions of boredom and sleepiness the bus
picked up speed and rattled toward town

  it disgorged most of its passengers at the
central bus station and larry hurried toward
red dawn



the examiner building wishing he had time
for a quick cup o coffee he had to pass it
up the wire opened at four and he had to
write and punch enough in the next forty min-
ates to get something on for the four-thirty
split

 a janitor was mopping the entrance to the
examiner and nodded a greeting as larry
lurried in larry ran up the one flight of
itairs to the city room where the allied news
service had its office partitioned off in one
ximer

  at one side of the large room near the copy
lesk a light burned at a littered desk and a
nan slept there in a top coat and hat tipped
ff his head

 larry smiled grimly pete lindquist was
in another one it wasnt unusual to find the
ice reporter at his desk sleeping off too many
lours in the press club usually larry or
vhoever was working the early morning split
vould awaken the good looking examiner man
efore the papers crew began to arrive

  in the bureau office larry hastily shed hat
ind coat and snapped on the teletypes in a
ew moments stuff would come in from san
francisco and when they finished down there
arry would feed his copy into the machine

 the night man had left some overnight
unched and ready to go larry quickly
scanned the remainder of the last nights news
ind went to work the teletypes began to
dick the california scoops

 at four-thirty he fed in his punched tape
ind watched the fifteen minutes of news clack
ut on the copy paper finished he lit a ciga-
rette and relaxed he had an hour and a half
efore the next split time for a cup of cof-
ee and something to eat at six his day man
vould come on

 as he went through the city room pete
lindquist grunted in his sleep and moved
slightly

 better let him sleep larry thought
hell wake up to a hangover soon enough

 the night phone rang on the city editors
lesk larry hesitated for a moment and then
inswered it

 lindquist a voice asked

 no but hes here wait a moment

 never mind the voice snapped the line
went dead

 larry dropped the telephone in its cradle
polite guy he thought

 the janitor had finished mopping and the
ioyer was empty as larry left the building
i thin man in a black coat and hat down over
his eyes brushed past him going into the
building

  it was after five when larry returned to the
examiner he walked up the stairs feeling
better with ham-and-eggs and coffee under
his belt

 he started through the city room when he
 noticed lindquist and stopped

 something was wrong lindquists head
 had turned on the desk top so that he faced
 larry his eyes were wide open staring

 larry hurried to him and stopped again his
 eyes riveted on the reporter

 good god he breathed

 someone had caved in the back of lind-
 quists head

	 

 the man in charge of the homicide squad
 introduced himself as lieutenant rodson he
 was middle-aged and displayed theefficiency
 that comes from long experience

 larry haider explained what had happened
 about the telephone call and the thin man who
 had brushed past him at the building entrance

 rodson looked thoughtful

 lindquist played around in some queer
 places he said places where a man can
 pick up enemies

 larry nodded he was in trouble with
 some husband last year and ive heard other
 tales

 an assistant who had been busy over the
 body turned to rodson and handed him a
 wallet without comment

 rodson thumbed through the dead mans
 pocketbook he glanced briefly at a social
 security card and a drivers license then he
 closely inspected a photograph

 know the woman he asked larry and
 passed a snapshot to him

 larry took it and tried to cover the hollow
 empty shock that the picture brought to him
 in the far corner of the room the teletype chat-
 tered monotonously rodson sensing a change
 in larry looked at him closely

 who is she he prompted

 larry didnt try to explain it in his mind
 he simply stared at the picture and everything
 in the room and the world stood still

 i dont know he muttered

 ttis own questions began to assail him

    what was mildreds picture doing in
 lindquists wallet what had been going on
 between his wife and the examiner man  was
 this the answer to the frequent quarrels the
 strained marriage the unhappiness  he hadnt
 thought of another man but there was her pic-
 ture in another mans wallet

 rodson was asking him a question

 what did you say larry asked blankly

 youre sure you dont recognize her

 larry shook his head

 rodsons eyes narrowed whats bothering
 you so much

 i-i guess im not used to murder larry
 said tightly

 rodson nodded and looked impassively at
 squad men working at their routine jobs a


don james

 medical examiner yawned and got ready to
 leave two men from an ambulance waited
 patiently with a stretcher

   larry hopelessly tried to make thoughts add
 up to a sensible answer in the bureau office
 the teletype continued to chatter

   ive got to get the next split on the wire
 larry said tonelessly

   a squad man held up a heavy piece of type
 metal that someone had used for a paper
 weight on a desk

  killed him with this he told rodson
 briefly

  fingerprints

  wiped clean

   rodson turned to larry youll be around
 today he asked well want to talk with
 you later

  ill be around larry said he walked
 stiffly to the bureau he wondered how he was
 going to make sense of the news hed have to
 punch on the teletype ticker the only
 thought that pounded through his mind was
 the question of why his wifes picture had been
 found in the dead mans pocketbook

   it was late morning when the excitement of
 the city room murder died down and things
 began to work smoothly larry slipped into
 his coat

   im going out for an hour or so he said
 ill call in

   he hurried through streets that had become
 alive with the morning and caught a bus he
 tried not to think on the way out but the
 questions drummed methodically at him seek-
 ing probing

  mildred was in the kitchen over a tardy
 breakfast when he arrived even in an old
 housecoat with hair uncombed she was pretty
 he thought pretty enough for a man like
 lindquist to want

   she looked up from her coffee in surprise
 when he came in

  whats wrong she asked

   he walked to the sink and drank a glass of
 cold water before he answered it helped to
 stop the trembling within him

   wed better have a talk he said

   if you came out here in the middle of the
 morning just to pick a quarrel with me-

  someone murdered pete lindquist this
morning larry said curtly

  his wifes mouth remaird open over un-
 said words and her eyes wii ened a thin line
 of whiteness edged itself ar und her lips

  murdered her voice was a hoarse
whisper

  the police found your picture in his
wallet 

   suddenly she was  her feet staring at
 him

   youre lying she cried youre trying
 to frighten me

   tttm telling the truth he said dully and
im learning another

  but i-we-

  was there something between you two
he asked

   she shut her eyes and tried to stop the via
lent trembling that swept over her

   he crossed to her and his hands bit into her
shoulders she was limp in his grasp

  tell me he whispered tell me the
truth

  she turned her head in a forlorn hopeless
gesture he shook her with straining fingen
abruptly her eyes opened and she struggle
to free herself

  i hate you she cried hysterically i
hate you she clawed at the fingers on her i
shoulders

  his hands dropped limply

  then its true about you and lindquist
he said

  yes its true and now hes dead

   she stumbled to a chair at the table and sank
down a crumpled figure with head buried in i
her arms and sobs racking her body

  blindly larry turned and walked out of the i
house he wondered if he would ever return
there was nothing left there for him

	 

  on the way back to town the shock of the i
truth he had learned about his wife faded be- 
neath the realization that eventually someone
would identify the picture from lindquists
wallet

  when rodson learned who the woman was 
hed know that larry haider had lied to him i
realization became icy water that spread i
through larrys body

  that gives me a motive he thought
rodson will tab me for the murder i should
have admitted that it was her picture 

  he remembered how vague his story had
been the telephone call the thin man coming
into the building there was no one to prove
that it wasnt larrys imagination that had
invented the call and man

  perspiration broke out and crept from be-
neath his hat band within hours rodson
would send for him and there would be the
questions and the clumsy attempts to explain
they wouldnt believe that he hadnt know
about his wife and the dead newspaper man
too many people in the bureau had heard him
quarrel over the telephone with mildred ha
known that they were not getting along

  he wondered how many of them knew about
lindquist maybe he was the only one who
didnt know maybe the others had been
laughing at him behind his back

  but rodson wouldnt laugh rodson would-
tie it all up into a motive an opportunity an
a murder with larry haider tabbed for a
death cell
red dawn



fphe bus stopped at a downtown corner and
larry left it hurriedly he couldnt go back
to the bureau now he had to have time to
think

  he found a cafe and ordered coffee the
pungent taste of it seemed to clear his mind

  ive got to find that man who came in this
morning he thought and ive got to do
it before rodson identifies that picture and
picks me up ill never get a chance if he
takes me in

  larry tore at the puzzle trying to find a
place to start an opening that would lead to
the end someone knew he was there he
thought the phone call and he had been
somewhere during the evening

  the press club looked unusually empty in
the morning larry went to the bar where a
squat bartender nodded and wiped the top ex-
pectantly larry ordered a soft drink

  so somebody killed lindquist the bar-
tender said

  larry nodded

  well you never know the bartender
observed wisely pete was in here late yes-
terday afternoon little did i think hed be
dead today 

  was he here alone larry asked casually
  the bartender smiled knowingly

  that guy alone when there was a woman
within ten miles

  nervous fear made larrys next question
low and hurried

  he was with a woman

  he wondered if the bartender would nod and
describe mildred

  he was with that babe who works in tony
cintrellas night spot-clara lorn the bar-
keep said blonde and like a calendar girl
larry smiled in relief

  they went out together

  about midnight i wasnt here then but
sam told me this morning sams working
night shift

  pete and the gal must have made quite a
night of it larry suggested

  they were plastered when they left here
the bartender grinned

  larry finished his drink and left

  on a corner he debated his next move a
prowl car drove slowly by and instinctively he
turned to look in a window the car didnt
stop he wondered if rodson had sent out a
pick-up order for him

  abruptly he walked down the street a few
moments later he climbed stairs to the night
club where clara lorn worked

  the same vacant appearance of the press
club hung over the night spot the bar was
deserted at the far end of the place a jafrttor
was waxing the floor near him was an open
door into another room and the sound of a
voice came faintly through the quiet the

voice stopped and there was the sound of a
telephone dropping into its cradle

  larry walked across the club to the open
door the janitor glanced at him impassively
and continued his waxing

  it was a  office and a short fat man with
thinning h ir looked up from papers on a
desk

  something i can do for you the fat man
asked

  are you cintrella

  the fat man nodded

  larry said a girl named clara lorn
works for you she was with pete lindquist
last night before he was murdered this morn-
ing im from allied news thought there
might be a story if i talked with her

  if news of lindquists death startled the
nightclub owner he didnt show it larry sup-
posed it had been on the radio though

  she comes to work this afternoon cin-
trella said yesterday was her day off

  do you know where she lives

  cintrella hesitated and then shrugged he
brought a small notebook from a desk drawer
and consulted it indifferently he gave larry
an address

  larry thanked him and turned to leave
just a second cintrella said softly you
going to use her name in a story
probably-if theres a story

  you going to mention where she works
larry got it then he smiled crookedly
ill leave the name of your club out if thats
what you mean

  cintrella smiled thats fine want a
drink

  larry refused and cintrella walked to the
main entrance with him

  i know you got to print the news he
said but if you leave the name of the club
out ill appreciate it getting mentioned in
murder stories isnt good publicity some guys
like it i dont

  outside larry took a taxi to the address
cintrella had given him and found that it was
a third rate apartment house he found her
apartment number on an outside listing a
middle-aged woman carrying a shopping bag
came out larry caught the door before it
could latch and went in

rphe apartment was on the third floor he
rapped three times before a voice answered
him

  who is it

  telegram larry said

  there was movement within the apartment
and the door opened a blonde wearing a thin
bathrobe over pajamas eyed him suspiciously
whats the gag she demanded

  he grinned im from allied news some-
one murdered pete lindquist this morning


don james

 the girl regarded him with steady eyes
 after a few moments she spoke

 so somebody killed him what does that
 make me

 you were out with him last night

 what time was he killed

 around five oclock

 i left him at four she said

 let me come in and talk it over

 she shook her head theres nothing to
 talk over

 larry looked at her shrewdly youre in
 the clear but you were with him last night
 how the papers play it depends upon how you
 play it

 abruptly she opened the door come in
 she said shortly

 she motioned him to a chair and selected
 a davenport for herself when she lit a ciga-
 rette he noticed that her hand trembled
 who killed him she asked

 they dont know

 what do you want from me

 where you went and what you did

 her account was colorless they had left the
 press club and visited several night clubs in-
 cluding cintrellas lindquist had taken her
 home at about four oclock that was the last
 she had seen of him

 larry was thoughtful did he talk with a
 tall thin man in a dark topcoat during the
 night

 i dont think so

 something about the way she avoided his
 eyes made him press further do you know
 a man who looks like that

 she looked at him with expressionless eyes
 maybe she said why

 because a man who looks like that prob-
 ably killed him

 she stood and restlessly walked about the
 room finally she stopped at a window and
 gazed down into the street

 what makes you think that she asked
 over a shoulder

 i saw a man like that go into the examiner
 just before he was murdered he said flatly

 at the window the girl stiffened her eyes
 intent upon the street below abruptly she
 whirled and spoke but it wasnt to larry she
 was looking beyond him at a half closed door
 that obviously led into her bedroom

 nick she said sharply the cops i
 theyre downstairs

 the door swung back and a man came into
 the room

 larry sprang to his feet the man was the
 thin man he sought

 i want you larry snapped and started
 toward the man

 the man called nick brought a hand from a
 coat pocket and a squat blue gun jerked up
 toward larry and i want you he said

 jjomewhere in the apartment a door buzzer
 sounded

 whatll i do nick the girl asked tensely

 stall ill take this guy down the back
 stairs and out the basement door

the man stepped toward larry turn
around and out the door he barked

 the newsman looked at the gun and turned

 they walked along a hallway to back stairs
 the gun nudged against larry and the
 mans breathing was close on his neck

 the basement was empty and they scurried
 into an alley

 down the alley and turn left nick in-
 structed the blue coupe youll drive

 larry wet dry lips and nodded he suddenly
 realized that nick had heard every word that
 had been said in the apartment that meant
 that nick knew he had been identified as
 a probable murderer suddenly larry was
 frightened there was no reason why nick
 shouldnt plan to kill again to cover another
 crime

 a few moments later larry slipped behind
 the wheel of the coupe nick inserted the
 ignition key in the lock and turned it

 out the boulevard to the hacienda he
 said

 larry recognized the name of a suburban
 night club

 and be careful the man added i dont
 mind killing

 during the afternoon it had grown hot in
 the small backroom at the hacienda sitting
 across the room from larry nick lit another
 cigarette and looked at the newspaper man
 with bleak eyes

 when they arrived the man in the dark top-
 coat had locked larry in the room and larry
 had heard the dialing of a telephone down the
 hallway and then a few low words nick had
 come back to the room then

 since his return there had been no talk no
 movement just the methodical lighting of
 cigarettes and nicks hands toying with the
 squat gun

 larry glanced at his wrist watch it
 after three he wondered what was happerir
 at the examiner and at the bureau he won
 dered what lieutenant rodson was doing

cuddenly heavy footsteps sounded it
 the halh ay and the door jerked openn
cintrella wal ed into the room looking out of
breath and worried

 he gave larry haider a brief glance
 then turned to nick

 this is a hell of a mess tanner he ex-
 ploded

nick tanner eyed him with an ami
smile

 you ought to know he said easily you
 started it
red dawn



  something like fear crossed tony cintrellas
eyes

  shut up he snapped not in front of
him

  why not nick tanner asked he saw
me go into the examine he was looking for
me

  cintrella began to pace the floor a thick
heavy man obviously perturbed

  how much does he know he demanded
of tanner

  the man shrugged too much

  i shouldnt have let you go through with
it cintrella rapped i knew that as soon as
you left

lindquist is dead tanner said tonelessly
you loused it up crinella said angrily
you let this guy see you i should have
known better that to use a damn fool who-
thats enough tanner said softly my
gun is for hire but i canuse it for myself
dont shove maybe ill decide to use it
tony crinella mopped at his face with a
handkerchief okay okay he muttered
what are we going to do

  you figure that this town is your back
yard not mine

  cintrella stuffed his handkerchief into a
pocket

  incidentally he snapped at tanner
where were you all morning i tried to find
you

  in clara lorns apartment

  the night club owner stared at him i
told you to stay away from her i wouldnt
have given this monkey her address if i had
known you were there he paused and add-
ed how much does she know

  tanner shrugged shes not dumb
  damn you i-

  suddenly tanner stood okay fat boy
he said thinly lets cut out the gab you
found ou that lindquist had learned youre
wanted for murder in new york and planned
to use it in the clean-up job the examiner
wants to start against the hot spots in town
you get me last night after lindquist got too
many drinks in your joint and hinted what he
was going to do to you you tell me to fol-
low him when he leaves with clara and to take
care of him i did but this punk sees me go
in were both in a spot but not the spot hes
in

  larry swallowed hard his eyes intent upon
the two men

  will you shut up cintrella demanded
spilling all that in front of this guy
whats the difference tanner smiled
hes not going to be talking any more after
while dead men havent much to sayi-
cintrella had the handkerchief out again
sopping at his forehead

  full realization of what tanner meant

drummed into larrys mind he got to his
feet

  you cant- he started to say

  tanner motioned the gun toward him sit
down

  larry sat down again desperately wonder-
ing if he would have a chance if he rushed the
thin man abruptly he wished he had gone to
rodson and told him the story this wasnt a
job for an amateur you had to be tough to
deal with killers tougher than a news bureau
man

  tanner nodded at a newspaper in cintrellas
coat pocket

  what are the cops doing he asked

  cintrella unrolled the paper larry recog-
nized an early street edition of the examiner
he could see the heavy black headline
examiner reporter murdered

  cintrella glanced down the page and a
change came over him his heavy frown disap
peared and he looked thoughtful

  i didnt get a chance to read this on the
way out he said he looked at larry
whats your name punk

  larry haider

  the fat man smiled and looked at tanner

  the cops are looking for him he said
they learned that lindquist was playing
around with this guys wife and they label his
story about you and the phone call as phony-
he left there this morning and said hed be
back in an hour theyre still looking for him
and for their money hes guilty

  tanners eyes narrowed

  okay ill take it from there he said
we bump this guy and make it look like
suicide we make him write a confession to
leave that takes care of everything

	 

  once during the day the shock of learning
about his wifes infidelity had made life sour
and hopeless to larry haider now faced with
death he realized that it was sweet he didnt
want to die what had happened between mil-
dred and him seemed suddenly far away and
almost unimportant now the important thing
was to live and facing him in the small room
was death

  a deep urgency became a frantic despera-
tion to prolong time to delay death he
grasped at straws

  youd better get straightened out with
your fat partner tanner he said his voice
was weak when he wanted it to be strong
his thoughts were mice wildly trying to es-
cape a trap

  tanner looked at him

comeone called lindquist just before he
was killed larry blurted rapidly he
hung up before i could call pete maybe some-
one was trying to warn him maybe it was


don james

cintrella he just said he shouldnt have let
you go through with it

  so what tanner asked

  if cintrella called that means he was
afraid-that he didnt trust you at the last mo-
ment and thought youd blow things

  youre crazy cintrella snapped why
should i-

  let him talk tanner interrupted
cintrella mopped at his forehead and was
silent

  larry said if he didnt trust you then
he wont now hes afraid of you you know
too much and youve murdered for him hes
been running away from one rap for a long
time

  keep talking tanner said

  the easiest way to keep you from talking
is to get rid of you

  i can take care of myself tanner
snapped

  this is cintrellas back yard larry re-
minded him not yours how many other
guys has he around to handle tilings for him
or maybe he might do it himself hes mur-
dered before

  the fat night club owner spoke harshly
hes stalling your idea is good nick go
ahead with it make him write the confes-
sion

  tanner looked at him with deadly interest
maybe he talks sense he said softly did
you call lindquist when i was heading there
were you going to tip him off

 no

  i called you and told you where he was
said i had to wait until the janitor got out of
the entrance did you call him tanner
pressed

  no dont think that i-

  i think youre lying tanner said

nick i didnt cintrella said harshly
maybe id be smart to eliminate everyone
who knows that i bumped lindquist nick
tanner said except clara ill take her
with me

  cintrellas floridness paled and grey tinged
his lips

  wait nick dont let this guy give you
ideas

  the gunmans full attention was on the fat
man now larry felt his leg muscles contract
and he was very still hed been lucky and
hed started something

  tanners gun was up again and this time it
menaced cintrella

  i dont think i like you tanner said in
his quiet voice

dont be a fool nick im in this as deep
as you are you know about that rap back
east youve got me where you want me
you can always talk if youre alive tan-
ner told him

  tony cintrella stared down at the gun in
tanners hand

  no he whispered

  cintrella youd fold like a wet bar towel
if the cops got tough with you tanner said

i dont like it im going to do something
about it

  his eyes watched cintrella carefully the
smile on his tightened lips had become tense
and ugly

  no cintrella cried nick youre
wrong i-

  nick tanner took a step toward him and
the springs that were larry haiders leg mus-
cles uncoiled as he lunged toward the gun-
man

  desperately larry struck down on tanners
gun arm sharp pain ripped through his wrist
but he heard the sharp grunt from tanner and
the clattering sound of the gun hitting the
floor	t

  larry fell forward his body over the gun
a hand groping madly for it

  tanner kicked and the blow thudded into
larry haiders face there was a flash of red
before his eyes he tried desperately to clear
his mind

  the touch of metal in the hand beneath him
helped he rolled and tried to fend off kicks
with his free arm something crashed into his
mouth he spit out blood

  he rolled again and brought the gun up
blindly he pulled the trigger knowing that he
probably would miss but hoping the shot
would stop them momentarily

  he didnt miss cintrella screamed and
staggered to the wall holding his wounded
shoulder

  im hit   im hit  he moaned fran-
tically

  tanner hurled himself at larry ai d larry
fired again low tanner lurched a kwardly
and crashed to the floor his hands pwing at
a shattered shin bone

  larry stumbled to his feet and backed to
the door there was a key on the outside he
turned it as he quickly slammed the door to
the room

  down the hallway he saw the wall telephone
tanner had used

  his breath was heavy as he spoke rapidly to
the desk sergeant who took his call

  down the hallway in the locked room cin-
trella still moaned he was moaning when
lieutenant rodson unlocked the door twenty
minutes later

  the bus stopped at his corner and larry
haider alighted and headed wearily for home 
he was tired and his nerves were tight
through him like singing violin strings

  the scene at the hospital marched through
his mind like a monotonous parade cintrella
broken moaning talking wildly and accusing
red dawn



tanner tanners tight-mouthed silence then
the ugly words he voiced at cintrella and
later at headquarters with clara lorn fright-
ened and talking answering questions with
deep fear in her eyes

  afterwards rodson shook hands with larry
haider and congratulated him he handed a
telephone to him so that he could phone the
story in a bureau man is a newspaper man
first other things would have to come after-
wards

twow he walked toward the house where he
and mildred had lived and loved and
quarreled and eventually found unhappiness
the door was unlocked

  he left his coat and hat in the hallway and
walked slowly into the kitchen mildred was
there and food was cooking on the stove she
stoo at the sink staring straight ahead out
the  indow

  ive a good dinner for you she said
you must be tired ive had the radio on i
know about it

  larry wet his bruised lips with his tongue
and tried to make sense of what she said he
had expected to find her gone the house empty
and cold he didnt understand this or did
she think he was fool enough to-

  she turned and tears were streaming down
her face ive had a lot to think about to-
day lar-y she said ive been a fool what
happened between pete and me wasnt as seri-
ous as you think i kissed him a few times
and i thought i was crazy about him but
when he was murdered and you-you were
gone and they couldnt find you 

  she stopped and then went on in a choked
voice

  ive died a hundred deaths today think-
ing that maybe youd killed for me thinking
he might be dead because of me and they
told about him and clara lorn and   and i
knew hed been playing with me i think ive
always known

  tears made her eyes bright under the kitch-
en light on the stove a tea kettle began to
sing

  ill do anything you say she whispered
ill leave if you want it that way but-but
i love you larry

  too many things were with him and he
couldnt think straight people could make mis-
takes mildred could he remembered how it
had been at first he remembered his own
mistakes you cant be right always but you
can learn

  tomorrow hed think about it tomorrow
they could talk about it maybe it would be
all right maybe it would even be better
sometimes it took something like this to make
things right

  anything you say she whispered her
eyes gentle

  he tried to smile and it brought a sharp
twinge of pain to his lips

  then how about a little dinner he said
softly

  he didnt know how gentle her lips could
be until they were pressed against his bruised
mouth

  and maybe the kiss was rushing things a
little somehow though he didnt care
things were going to be all right

he was tough and steel-hard all right a mean and mer-
ciless private eye who as he cheerfully admitted would

ink the gold fillings from his dead grandmothers teeth
or a profit i hated him but i had to work for him and

foi

im afraid to think what might have happened if it
werent for the corpse the crying girl-and a bowl of
milk

this was the last time eddie would
search for his lovely too-lively torch
singer wife until she herself started
to seek him with her blue dead
fingers groping blindly from the lacy
tissue of the candy box   



the young man lit a cigarette before
he went inside the tavern he knew
hed need one in there but he couldnt
risk having anybody notice how iis hand
shook

he went straight to the end of the bar the
piano was just four feet away

gimme a double shot vvhitey

the bartender set it down carefully the
glass was pretty full

floras not here yet eddie she told me
to tell you not to wait

the young man filled his lungs with smoke
and blew it out with a hiss like steam taking
a lid off

ill wait he said trying to control his
hand as he reached for the shot glass of raw
whisky

okay eddie but its a shame to spill that
song for flora

whiskey want i should lift it up to your
mouth 

  go to hell whitey  

  now look kid why get sore at me i
give you a message from flora thats all she
told me to tell you 

  yeah asked eddie his eyes too bright
in his haggard face she says i shouldnt
wait just when did she tell you that
this aftenoon she dropped in about four
and picked up her pay envelope then she sat
down at the piano and played a couple of tunes
absent-like her eyes were on the glassy side
   you know  

  who else was here then whitey

  just the usual barney emmett was hang-
ing over the piano and she wasnt giving him
any chatter at all her face was white and
she looked plenty sore at the guy and cass
edwards was around with his gang pretty
drunk and loud

  i should have busted barney emmetts
lantern jaw a long time ago said eddie
the way he hangs around flora 

  barneys not a guy you can bust said
whitey shrugging bitterly lot of people
have tried that to their sorrow and i guess
flora can handle herself

  eddie finally got the shot glass to his mouth
without spilling more than a third of it over
his hand

  who went with flora when she left here
whitey

  i dunno kid she goes out the back way
after leaving the message for you and i dont
notice particularly why how come youre
so upset about the dame all of a sudden 
eddie was watching the bartenders face
very closely but whitey had a hard map to
read and he looked as calm as ever

  just in the mood for asking questions
whitey thats all she said i shouldnt wait
for her huh

  thats right

  and what time did she say it

  four oclock

  okay whitey so long

  eddie glanced once at the piano as he left
flora wouldnt be sitting there tonight playing
those lazy tunes she toved so much her round
white arms wouldnt be moving with the
rhythms of the dreamy spell she created her
warmth was gone the piano looked black
and cold as forbidding as an automatic

  he walked two blocks down and got into
his cab

  a fare came up

  sorry buddy said eddie i got a call
he drove off his hands sweating on the wheel

  whitey was a damn liar at four oclock
that afternoon flora had been dead for several
hours it was just after his noon stop for
eggs and a cup of steam that hed found her
body stuffed into the back of his cab

  not all of her body-just part of it- just
the head with a few strands of the blonde hair
caught in the zipper of the leather bowling
bag

  the shock hadnt worn off it was still
pounding through him making it impossible
for him to think of what he ought to do go
to the police hell theyd slap him in the
clink so fast he -wouldnt have a chance it
would be open and shut to them

  flora was a handful as well as an eyeful
and when youre married to a dame like that
theres bound to be other guys and in a spot
like that the cops can figure youve got a
solid motive for killing her somebody else
had thought of that angle and had planted
enough evidence in his cab to send him to the
chair eddie didnt want to play that way

  so he had kept quiet all afternoon trying
to guess it out he had put the bowling bag
into the trunk of the car without looking at
the thing again one look had been enough 
one touch of the yellow hair one glimpse of
that fair skin faintly dotted with freckles

  he knew vaguely what he had to do now
the same thing hed done a lot of other nights
look for flora only this time he wouldnt
be expecting to find her higher than a kite
making the rounds of the joints with five or
six men hed be looking for the rest of her
body it had to be somewhere

  and when he found it he might find evi-
dence enough on somebody else to make it all
right for him to yell copper

  but not until eddie knew enough about
circumstantial evidence to know that hed be
everybodys choice for the most likely suspect
a clear conscience doesnt do you any good
at all not if the court thinks youre guilty

he drove to the apartment to shave and
change clothes trying desperately to
think straight with his aching head one
thing was for sure somebody had killed flora
and was trying to frame him

  but eddie hadnt any desire to burn for a
murder he didnt commit there wasnt any

special reason why he should want to go on
living he told himself he didnt have a
helluva lot to look forward to but he kept
thinking of little things he liked about being
alive he got a kick out of the goofy fares he
ran across he liked the thick flapjacks he
got at the diner with the hunks of hard butter
melting under the syrup he liked to walk up
randolph street on his night off and maybe
take in a movie he liked big steins of beer
in the summer and the free concerts in grant
park not much to live for but it was his
life and he liked it

  something else was important beside saving
his own skin somebody had killed flora and
they ought not to get away with it it was a
lousy thing and made him burn deep inside
with a longing to get his hands around the
killers throat and give him a dose of his own
medicine

  he thought about flora as he snaked the
cab through the heavy traffic to his apartment
on the south side he didnt have much real
feeling left for her hed loved her plenty in
the beginning like all these other guys did
now some dames are like that they got
hearts so big they can always find room for
one more and thats a good kind of woman
to be crazy about but its hell to be married
to one

  you get to watching out for her like you
would a kid because shes not too bright about
the company she keeps you quit being jealous
after a while and just hope she wont get onto
reefers or something really bad you let her
take the job at whiteys playing the piano
and you hope itll do her good but it doesnt
too many guys come in there that fall for her
it makes it easier to keep track of her though
you know its always from whiteys that she
started out and that makes it simpler to pick
up her trail if you have to go out looking for
her

  so when she gets killed you dont ciy your
eyes out but you do start remembering her
round white arms her full red lips and the
way she always had a smile for everybody
including you

  eddie remembered how warm her hands
always were how full of love and excitement
she had led him a dogs life sure but there
hadnt ever been any other woman for him
and hed hunt out her killer if it was the last
thing he ever did

   and itll probably be that he thought grimly
as he climbed the stairs to their two-room
apartment especially if i have to tangle with
barney emmett whitey was right-nobody
ever had any luck getting the goods on that
guy-not even the cops he had an organiza-
tion that made capones old gang look like a
bunch of boy scouts and barney had been
seeing flora pretty often he was in whiteys

placg nearly every night in fact since flora
had gone to work there barney had prac-
tically taken over at the small tavern eddie
more just thinking about that big jutting jaw
and the thick selfish mouth guys like that
shouldnt be allowed to operate the way they
do they get too smart get to thinking theyre
like god but whitey was right try to buck
up against a thug like barney you know
better-you dont know how you know-you
just do

  eddie snapped the lights on noticing the
apartment was just the way it always was
the rooms smelled musty and the murphy bed
was folded up sloppily the mattress sagging
where it had slipped out of the clamps floras
make-up things were scattered over the top of
the desk in the livingroom because there was
a better light there her mascara box was
open and she had left a stocking hanging over
the back of a chair there was that choking
dust over everything big gray rolls of it under
the heavy pieces of furniture where flora
said it didnt show anyway

  he walked into the dinette and kitchen the
breakfast dishes were still in the sink his
cup was there and floras with the lipstick
smear on one side and there was an egg shell
under the stove where flora must have aimed
at the can and missed

  nothing looks different he thought hed
half expected to see something changed to
show that flora had broken her usual routine
on the day of her murder but she must have
gone out like always not expecting anything
to happen

  eddie put the bowling bag into the far cor-
ner of the closet not knowing what else to do
with it he couldnt keep carrying it around
in his cab just touching the leather straps
and feeling the weight of it produced a quick
slimy sweat on his skin

  he took a warm shower and then went back
to the closet to get his good suit the double-
breasted brown that flora had liked he tried
not to think of the grisly thing that was there
in the dark corner of the cubicle he won-
dered if he would shudder like this every time
he opened the closet door

  he put his old suit on the hanger-funny-
he didnt have to squeeze all the clothes back
to get it on the rod-there seemed to be more
room then his eyes really focused on the
interior

  floras clothes were gone  the fur coat
her two evening dresses that she wore on spe-
cial nights at whiteys the plain black tiling
that she wore so it always looked like a dif-
ferent dress sometimes with a lace collar
sometimes with beads and sometimes with a
jewel belt the green wool that she said made
her look hippy

  all her clothes gone out of the closet but
one last song for flora



no make-up things that looked plenty queer
to eddie flora would rather go off without
her dresses than without her mascara and
creams and powder not only that the only
suitcase they had was still on the closet shelf
and it was empty eddie looked

 sphere was only one answer flora hadnt
 packed those clothes herself somebody
 else had run the risk of coming here and leav-
 ing with a suitcase full on the day she was
 murdered and cut up into pieces

    he switched off the lights and went out the
 back way onto the concrete porch and down
 the back steps to the janitors apartment
 maybe albert had seen somebody around

    albert came to the door looking comfortable
 with a pipe in his mouth

 hello mr henderson whats on the bum
 now i fixed that stopped drain last week
 yeah i know thanks albert say did
 you see anybody around here today
 always see people around dozens who
 you mean

   up at my place did you happen to notice
 anybody going up there or coming out
 dont believe so said albert wrinkling
 his shiny black brow with the painful process
 of thought nope dont recall seeing anybody
 around your place your wife out helling
 around again mr henderson

   thats none of your damn business 
 flared eddie

    now wait a minute soothed albert in his
 gentle drawl i didnt mean to go stickin
 my nose in where it dont belong didnt mean
 that at all but its no secret in this building
 about what kind of a life mrs henderson
 leads you youre a hard-working steady sort
 of man and its a shame what you have to
 put up with i just asked because if theres
  anything i can do   

    eddie gave him a crooked grin sorry that
 ihed blown his top hell he couldnt count
  the times that the good old coon had come out
  to help him get flora up the back stairs

    sorry albert im just on edge you sure
 j you didnt notice a man around the building
  with a suitcase

   with a suitcase yes now that you men-
  tion it mr henderson but not up at your

 i place he passed me in the lobby about two
  this afternoon

    why didnt you say so yelled eddie
 you didnt say suitcase besides he wasnt
 i oming out of your apartment when i saw
 j him just down in the lobby maybe thats
 j not even the one

  what did he look like albert

  i hardly noticed big heavy-set iellow
 with thick lips dark hair i think

   barney emmett those lips always stuck
  out albert would have turned white if hed

 realized that he had just put the finger on the
 big shot hood himself

   well thanks albert so long

  that the guy you want

   maybe take it easy said eddie

  he climbed into his cab and drove toward
whiteys place he had to find the rest of
flora and then find her kiher and when
youre looking for flora its always whiteys
that you start out from

   but he didnt get far a black sedan shot
out of a side street half a block from his own
apartment and nosed his cab to the curb

   what the hell   muttered eddie star-
ing into the muzzle of an automatic

   climb out hacker somebody else is doing
the driving tonight crawl into the back seat
of the sedan and see what it feds like to be
a customer

   eddie turned his eyes toward the car there
were three men inside in addition to the
bruiser that was holding a gun on him
gonna make trouble bud

   no said eddie getting into the car i
guess ill mind where we going

  he wants to know where were going
the big man with the gun said the others
laughed nastily

  eddie shut up then punks just a crowd
of punks out on a routine pick-up job and
trying to have a little fun on the side scaring
him well he wasnt scared if barney em-
mett wanted to see him it saved him the
trouble of looking for barney

  he fished out a cigarette the man with
the gun tensed

  mind if i smoke asked eddie

  go right ahead the smell of it dont
bother me none quipped the guy in a falsetto
but youre a real gentleman to ask first
they laughed at that too

  thanks sweetheart mumbled eddie
wishing he could take one good poke at this
smart-pants

  eddie noticed that the gunman relaxed as
soon as he had blown out the match a clown
but he tended to business

   they pulled up in an alley off state street
and it was eddies turn to laugh they were
parked in back of whiteys place

   barney took some extra trouble he said
i was on my way here anyhow

   for pleasure maybe but this aint gonna
be no pleasure go into the back room bar-
neys there

  they patted him to make sure he didnt
have a gun then they opened the door and
pushed him inside they didnt come in with
him

t arney had the room to himself whitey
 always let some of the boys play cards
back here and drink eddie could just picture


dorothy dunn

barney throwing his weight around telling
whitey to get those bums outta there so he
could have the room for some private business
he might pay whitey something for the
money hed lose on the room and he might
not-more likely not guys like barney got
what they wanted because everybody knew
what would happen if they didnt shell out on
demand

  eddie saw the gun on the table close to
barneys hand but he didnt care he was
glad he was here glad to be facing the man
who must have killed flora

  hello barney nice night for murder
  shut up

   all right said eddie you talk
   barney picked up the gun

  this does my talking for me wheres
flora

  you ought to know said eddie you
took her clothes out of the apartment 

  barney slapped out with the gun butt
scraping eddies cheek his thick neck was
red and he was puffing like an angry bull

  so the black boy did recognize me but
i didnt ask about that i said wheres
flora  if you dont tell me ill choke it out
of your skinny neck hurry up henderson
you knew she was leaving you for me now
what did you do to her

  barneys hot breath was right in eddies
face and the look in the mans eyes was almost
insane

  i didnt do anything to her snapped
eddie and i didnt know she was leaving
me i dont think she was

  where is she asked barney again his
shoulders slumping a little

   i dont know said eddie

  something was wrong eddie could feel
that barney wasnt putting on an act if he
killed flora why should he keep asking where
she was but if he hadnt killed her why
would he be so excited you dont look the
way he looked just because some dame you
like doesnt show up for a few hours

   henderson if you lie to me ill blow your
brains from here out to michigan boulevard
whats happened to flora

   eddie decided it was time to level off
   shes dead

  he expected barney to lash out at him
again but nothing like that happened

   its hers then he mumbled foolishly by
god i thought it was but i had to make
sure 

   eddies heart beat faster

  whats hers what barney

  this

   barney slid a candy box across the table to
eddie inside was a hand

   eddies stomach turned over and he flopped
the lid down

  some damn fool mailed that to me said
barney in a flat cold voice you wouldnt
pull a trick like that would you henderson
eddie looked into the murderous eyes

  no i wouldnt but if you didnt kill her
barney were looking for the same man
somebody gave me a present today too
yeah

  yeah-the head

  my god said barney you thought i
did that

  thats what i thought you took her
clothes out in a suitcase

  she left a message for me to pick them
up said she was leaving you and i should
get them thats all there was to that hen-
derson if its the last thing i do ill find the
lousy rat that did this and tear his heart out
with my bare hands did you call the cops
no

  good we can do it quicker ourselves
  you mean pull together asked eddie
  have a drink henderson

  eddie tipped the bottle up to his lips he
believed barney and said so with his eyes

  the big man heaved a long sigh and dug
at his cheeks with his meaty hand

  i loved flora hnderson thats a hell of
a thing but there it is i loved her too damn
much and somebody knew that 

  eddie looked the other way barney em-
mett the toughest man in chicago had tears
in his eyes

  it was four oclock in the morning the
back room at whiteys was filled with a blue
haze of smoke and the damp malty odor of
too much alcohol breath breathed into an al-
most airless room

  cass edwards and his three worthless
friends were there being worked over by
barney eddie hated all four men they had
money they were supposed to be from qual-
ity cass edwards especially yet they hung
around a place like whiteys drunk all the
time and they had often taken flora off on
their slumming trips eddie considered them
the worst degenerates in the book they
werent satisfied to go to hell themselves
they wanted to take other people along

tarney slapped cass again his heavy
fingers leaving big red streaks on the
weak face

  for gods sake barney cass whim-
pered ive told you all i know

  you said you got a package this afternoon
special delivery what was in it barney
yelled

  ive told you a hand-a human hand
  floras her right hand

  i dont know mumbled cass it looked
like hers

  and what did you do with it
one last song for flora



   i told you that too your man is out look-
ing for it now

  that doesnt matter tell me again
eddie wondered what kind of a torture
method this was cass was desperate

  i threw it down a manhole he repeated
oh dearborn street off randolph
why

  oh for gods sake barney let up 
  why

  cass broke then

  what the hell did i want to keep it for
he yelled what good is a dead hand
that did it barney jerked cass up out of
his chair and dragged him over to the table
he called to the down the gunman that had
picked eddie up in the sedan

  hold this right here barney instructed
the clown looked as happy as a lark as
he held the right wrist of cass edwards flat
against the wood

  eddie got a little sick when he heard cass
scream with pain every time the gun butt came
down it was a relief when he fainted every
bone in his right hand must have been crushed

  thatll show him rasped barney breath-
ing like an ox thatll show him what good
is a hand

  eddie didnt like cass edwards but he
couldnt stand much more of this barney was
letting his emotions take over he was acting
crazy he hadnt got to be the biggest man
in the chicago rackets this way

   cass was crying like a baby

  why dont you just kill me he screamed
at barney he was hysterical

  im going to said barney in his coldest
voice as soon as i check your story

  just then alex one of the gunmen came
in with a wet-looking cigar box

  here it is boss i had one helluva
time 

  who asked about your troubles asked
barney cutting him short he took the box
and looked inside he closed it quickly then
he placed it on the table beside the other cigar
box that had been mailed to him the bowl-
ing bag was there too barney hadnt lost
any time sending to get it

i told you it would be there said cass
rocking on the floor cradling his broken hand
now can i see a doctor

  yeah said barney youll need one
the shot was a thundering blast in the back
room and the smell of cordite curled up into
eddies nostrils along with the stale air

  barney put the gun back on the table with-
out batting an eye

  he shoulda had more respect for flora
than to pick a sewer he said now we got
to find the rest of her body alex

  yes boss

  no youre too dumb monk come here

  yes barney the clown stepped up
check the morgue again the police blotter
you can do all that through daly i want that
torso floras going to have a decent funeral
in a casket its not right 

  he broke off knowing he was giving out
with too much sentiment monk went out

  you got any ideas henderson any other
guys we can pick up who might know some-
thing what about that janitor

  not a chance said eddie thinking of
alberts round gentle face flora left the
house alive we know that youve traced her
movements as far as whiteys or almost
yeah said barney thoughtfully he
took a long drink draining the bottle the
clerk in the drug store saw her at eleven
oclock this morning and it was just a little
after noon time that she was killed had to
be the package was delivered to me by four
eddie almost had a thought right then but
it didnt quite come clear

  id like a drink he said suddenly my
head feels a little foggy

  okay said barney go get a couple of
bottles henderson and alex clear out
this mess of society trash no wonder we
cant think straight

  all of em boss

  hell yes they saw me trigger their pal
didnt they  an automobile accident ought to
do it you can fix that up dumb as yon are

etddie left the room in a hurry he was
scared now scared all the way down to
his heels and sicker inside than hed ever been
in his life barney wasnt human he was
some kind of monster operating the deadly
machinery of murder the way an ordinary
business man does a days work he could
see why people didnt try to cross barney
why they couldnt he could even understand
why the cops couldnt touch him nobody
could touch him and live

  eddie should have gone to the cops in the
beginning he knew that now hed been a
damn fool to let barney take over the job of
finding floras killer the man was a maniac
and eddie would have felt a lot safer in the
death house than he felt right now

  whitey was leaning on the bar sulking
  barney wants two bottles said eddie
  whitey got them down

  he say anything about paying for them
  no said eddie

  he never pays moaned whitey he
laps up more of my profit 

  eddie got out his wallet

  never mind kid said whitey and
here take a slugger with me im getting
tired of dick smithing out here barneys 
orders i cant even see whats going on in
my own back room sounds like torture
dorothy dunn

  its awful gulped eddie sliding his glass
back for more then all of a sudden it hit
him the thought hed almost had

  whitey he said youre a damn liar
  what do you mean kid

  about flora you said she was in here
at four oclock she couldnt have been she
was dead then 

  whiteys face didnt change its expression
hell eddie im sorry about that he
whispered barney made me promise to say
that he said hed kill me if i didnt i
thought then that something had happened
to flora that he was trying to cover up but
you know how it is eddie you dont dare
cross barney why just look at what hes
done to my business by coming in here hes
poison to have around a place people get
scared off and what can i do about it
eddie was getting it now prize chump
thats what he had been prize idiot

  barney killed flora

  who else eddie ive got a gun back here
if you want it kid

thanks said eddie hand it over
whitey obliged with a smile the first smile
that eddie had seen on his face for months

  eddie tucked it in his pocket and picked
up the bottles

  call the cops will you whitey its time
well have the case all finished by the time
they get here

  sure eddie whitey made for the phone
barney was alone in the back room again
his men had gone out the back way with
cass edwards and his pals

  took you long enough complained bar-
ney reaching for the bottles

  can that line said eddie

  barney didnt get riled he looked a little
tired eddie took the bottle he passed over
and asked casually say barney who told
you that flora was leaving me who gave
you that message to pick up her clothes
whitey

  thats what i thought said eddie his
mouth grim whitey killed flora

  barney just sat there you sure
yeah said eddie im sure you didnt
tell him to lie to me about flora being in
here at four oclock did you

  i didnt tell him anything

  neither did flora said eddie flora
didnt leave that message for your whitey
made it up he wanted to place you at my
apartment with a suitcase just in case some-
thing went wrong with his other frame
barney was taking it easy in a slow burn
but why should whitey kill flora
because of you said eddie he couldnt
get rid of you without getting rid of flora
he hates you barney

 why

  because youre hurting his business
yoiite ruining it he tried to play it smart
because he was afraid to cross you openly he
tried to drive you off your nut by sending you
a piece of his hate in a cigar box then he
pulled me into it and cass edwards thinking
one of us might polish you off for him he
knew how to hit you where it hurt the most
he knew how you felt about flora and he
didnt think id care he thought flora just
caused me a lot of grief

  barneys eyes were like glass now

  but you did care didnt you henderson
you wanted to get the man who killed
flora

  thats right barney i did care not
as much as you maybe but you dont forget
flora very easy once she gets under your
skin

  eddie pulled out the gun

  whitey gave me this to use on you
barney

   the hell you say  leave it here hender-
son he said picking up his own gun that had
already killed cass edwards this ones on
me 

  they went outside whitey wasnt behind
the bar but they heard his footsteps beating
it down the cellar stairs and they heard the
siren out in the street then the cops rushed
through the front door

  barney raced for the cellar and eddie
stayed upstairs listening to the shots and to
barneys shouted curses five shots one
wasnt enough for the rat that killed flora
barney let him have five shots in succession 

  the policeman stopped at the head of the
stairs beside eddie

  eddie caught his arm and whispered to him
barney emmett is down there youve
caught him red-hand committing a murder

  the cops face went white

  you can take him said eddie he just
emptied his clip one shot into cass edwards
five into whitey

nphey took him barney emmett the terror

  of chicago was captured without a single
shot being fired eddie went down into the
cellar with them and barney didnt seem to
be sore at all he certainly had been a sucker
for flora all he said was well hender-
son we nailed the rat that got her

  the right rat too there was no doubt
about that they found the torso down there
buried in a shallow grave and they found a
bowling ball that didnt have any bag to go
with it

  and barney emmett eddie felt a little
bit bad about playing him such a dirty trick
but hell he told himself barney had it com-
ing if anybody did

john bender

the water hit her with a
tremendous ky blow

what mad impulse made lovely
marion carter seek so desperately
the death which so she believed
would end the curse of murder
hanging like a sword above her
friends and kinsmen

 she came alert abruptly not knowing
 what had awakened her her eyes wide
 and searching in the darkness for long
 moments she lay staring intently at the lighter
 patch of darkness which was the ceiling then
 she tinned slowly to face the dock beside her
 bed she could hear its rhythmic ticking but
 could not see the time

   the movement slight as it was tumbled
 her brain into the cloying whirlpool and she
 thought with a quick despair no   i

   she buried her face in the pillow afraid
 sobbing slightly and the sickness in her re-
 lented but the clock began ticking more and
 more stridently her fear grew less she flung
 back the covers and pushed her legs out over
 tiie floor

   her eyes she found could now distinguish
 more clearly the outlines of the room though
 she thought vaguely that she could discern a
 light fog touching everything all at once the
 heat of the narrow bedroom clamped down on
 her and she struggled into her robe shaking
 her long black hair back over the collar

   from far off as in a dream she heard the
 low long mournful note of the fog horn on
 the point she stood there shivering despite
 the first few flecks of perspiration that beaded
 her upper lip and as the note of the fog horn




john bender

slipped into the heavy silence of the night she
knew what she must do

  the clock ticked slowly monotonously and
yet it screamed her thought

  destroy yourself    destroy yourself   
destroy yourself

  she laughed silently lips bared wolfishly
over her teeth if she were very silent oh so
very silent she could get down the long stairs
she could race across the hill to the little
bridge in grateful anticipation she could see
even now the dark and friendly waters of the
river beckoning to her   

  it will be nice and cool and friendly it will
cloak me in the soft secret comfort that i seek

  she went to the door her head felt lighter
than she had even known it her stomach flut-
tered slightly she opened the door and stepped
outside into the long-carpeted dimly-lit corri-
dor casting an apprehensive glance in both
directions no one thank god she thought
therell be no one to stop me this time

  as she hurried along the corridor and down
the winding stairs she recalled how jan and
roger had heard her the last time she saw
again in her mind the flight along the narrow
road to the bridge where she had run till she
thought her heart would burst trying to get
away from rogers swift pursuit hed caught
her though then there had been the burning
humiliation of being dragged back a prisoner
in her own house and the further humiliation
of being sick so dreadfully horribly animal
sick   

  the cold draft of air smashed her in the
face as she opened the big front door quickly
she hurried outside and closed the door softly
behind her

  free free

  one slender hand pushed the long dark hair
back off her eyes catching her robe in the
other she ran swiftly across the walk unmind-
ful of the cold stone on her bare feet in just
a few moments now she would be at the river
the lovely lonely river that would shelter her
forever

  her bare feet made a faint spattering sound
when she raced through the gravel driveway
to the road then she was outside on the high-
way fifty yards away shimmering like pale
silver was the river-to freedom

  no one must stop me now no one

  she reached the bridge and caught herself
breathing hard and now that she had stopped
running the hands began to clutch and claw
at her stomach she feared that she would be
sick again and hastened to the railing where
she leaned for a moment exhausted her head
spinning dizzily but gradually the rushing
water beneath her took on clarity she could
make out the small ripples that caught the
moon and winked it back at her in a thousand
little sparkles

  she slipped one long leg over the narrow
iron railing pulled herself to a sitting posi-
tionand put both feet on the small ledge on
the far side she took one long final breath
she released her hold on the railing

  the water hit her with a tremendous icy
blow she felt herself strugging for support
it couldnt give then all was a bottomless
darkness

iasy does it someone said

        she sputtered and choked then sneezed
violently

  the man bending down over her took the
glass away and put it on a small table beside
the bed

  he was big and clad in tobacco-brown tweed
slacks and a gay plaid shirt when he stepped
away she saw that his hair and his eyes were
brown for the rest he was tall and spare
with broad shoulders and a tan lean face the
sleeves of his shirt were rolled to the elbows
his shirt was open at the throat his hair
seemed freshly wet it dropped in small tight
ringlets on his tan forehead

  his smile was warm and friendly she felt
no fear at being here with him she felt very
little of anything not even relief without a
word she looked about the room-at the mas-
culine severe furnishings at the heavy-quilted
coverlet that was tucked up to her chin she
touched her hands against her nakedness and
the slight movements brought a further sting-
ing sensation to her nose she sneezed again

  good way to catch cold the brown young
man said this isnt the time of year for
moonlight dips

  why- she started the word loosed a
flood of tears she turned her dark head to
the clean crisp-smelling pillow startled that
she should be crying

  get rid of it he said all of it ill be
back later

  when he returned shed got control of her-
self she felt a trifle dizzy but the queerness
was gone from her stomach and her nose

  perhaps youd better sleep he said
would you like to miss-

  she didnt supply the name but she real-
ized dully that she would have to sooner or
later he would be another one why oh
why must all these people intrude upon her
why couldnt they let her alone

  miss- he asked again

  she said carter marion carter and
watched for flares of recognition to light with-
in his eyes but his tanned not unhandsome
face did not change the name was not
familiar to him and she was indeed quite
thankful

  you-you havent told anyone have you
she asked

  about what his grin was wide and free
blind date with the devil



about a silly girl who went swimming at this
time of year

  she found the tug upon her lips was a
smile hed dropped the subject so neatly and
emphatically conversation was almost easy
is this your house she asked

   lock stock and mortgage he told her
no one will bother you-ill see to that
after youre rested ill drive you home a
good nights sleep will do wonders for you
he went away and she listened to his fading
footsteps outside she looked around the room
once again but she could not keep her mind
busy enough-she had to think of the bridge
and the cool swift-flowing river he must
have seen her and jumped in after her ab-
ruptly she shuddered recalling the water
sweeping over her

   why why she asked the ceiling must she
be touched by death  she was not always in-
tent on it-only at occasional moments why 
oh god why what sinister force took con-
trol of her mind and body and in those awful
moments made her want to destroy herself
now as once before she was appalled by what
die had almost done

   for she knew she did not really want to die
shed had enough of it with harrys death

   abruptly she sat up in the strange bed the
sudden thought setting her heart to a thun-
derous pounding

   had she killed harry 

fphe young mans name was duncan mac-
clure-even though he spoke without a
burr he was twenty-seven an artist when he
needed money and a year or so ago had been
chasing jap zeros in a stubby gruman out
over the blue pacific he had been discharged
before the war was finished without benefit of
points for there were in him odd pieces of
japanese-made metal that caused peculiar
pains recently though the doctors had
prospected with success and found the alien
lode so that within a month or so he would
be fit and well again ready to pick up his
brush and palette with more result than he had
in the recent past

   and that he said as they drove toward
idlewood brings you up to date on me ex-
cept for the little house a friend of a friend
of a friend got it for me

  you were lucky marion said she was
glad to talk of simple things like wars and
housing situations in the clear and dripping
morning sunlight for she didnt have to go too
far into her mind to get the necessary thoughts
and words her sentences came as easily as
her clothes had come when this strange
young man had pointed to a closet and told
her to use what she wanted what hsd he
said oh yes some of the things belong to
my sister-some were left by models  

   marion drew in great lungfuls of the fresh
crisp connecticut morning it was so good to
be alive-

   but with that thought the memory of last
night and all its horror returned clamping her
with its cold wet hand it gripped her during
the rest of the ride when the coupe pulled
up the long gravel driveway of idlewood she
found it almost impossible to stop trembling

   she was afraid    the terror she asso-
ciated with this rambling country mansion re-
turned with a strange insistence she was
afraid of jan and roger and mr billing it
all had to do with the last time when shed
overheard roger - jans recently-returned
young man-saying that the shock of harrys
death was too great a blow for marions mind
to handle   

   as they stopped in front of the house the
front door opened and a girl came out to stand
on the short flight of stone steps she bent
her blonde head forward peering into the car
seeing marion she came quickly down the
steps her shapely legs flashing in the sun-
light

  marion she cried oh marion dear
im so glad youre all right we were so wor-
ried about you

   they got out of the car though she shiv-
ered marion allowed her sister to embrace
her for a moment before she had to break
away janis was an impressionable young
girl three years marions junior and had
always looked to her sister for guidance since
the death of their parents when they were little
girls

   after she had disentangled herself from her
sisters embrace marion introduced mac
mr macclure is almost a neighbor janis
he-he lives over in that little cottage near
the water

   how nice janis said she really was not
interested in him and marion felt embar-
rassed but duncan did not seem to mind in
the least

  wherever did you go last night marion
mr billing and roger and i didnt know what
to think we called the police but they said
they never investigate a missing person case
until at least twenty-four hours go by marion
you frightened us so where-

   yes indeed young lady whats the mean-
ing of scaring us out of our wits  you ought
to be spanked  there was laughter or the
hint of it at least in joseph billings boom-
ing voice he was a huge man given to loud
ties but his benevolent ogreish manner did
not fool marion for an instant he was an-
other one of them hed been harrys lawyer
he was staying here now to settle the estate
she had known him since she was quite a
small child

  nervously she looked to duncan a mute


john bender

pleading in her eyes for him not to reveal
what had happened

  he grinned quickly she heard duncan say
why i dont know what you folks are rais-
ing such a ruckus about marion and i went
down to new york last night and did the town
up properly i guess neither of us thought
about phoning my fault

  she heard the quick intake of breath saw
janis looking at her with horror on her pretty
child-like face marion felt suddenly weak
the fearful sickness threatened to return she
looked at the queer frozen expression duncan
wore as he saw the effect of his words on these
people and the man who had come out of the
big house

  really marion said roger southern
hurrying past the others across the flagstones
to her you should have known better
janis caught her fiances hand she seemed
to cling to him for strength which duncans
words had stolen from her

  that was pretty bad taste marion she
said she turned still holding rogers hand
and started for the house

  in a minute dear said rogers and took
marions arm solicitously come along now
well get you to bed

  marion turned to duncan his face told her
that he was struggling to understand she felt
a momentary twinge of pity then again the
inner fear she did not want to say what she
had to say but perhaps it was best to tell him
now and get him out of her mixed-up life she
didnt know she didnt know if only she
could escape these scenes these prying peo-
ple   

  i should have-told you she said testily
to him why did she hope suddenly that he
he alone would understand and help her
   you see duncan it was notthe first
time-last night it happened before-the day
that harry was killed he was my step-father
he was buried yesterday 

  im sorry duncan said if id known-
of course of course said roger but as
miss carters doctor id suggest we all get
inside out of this treacherous weather

  the house was warmer but the smell of
death the smell of flowers and an aged musti-
ness clung everywhere marion wanted only
to be alone away from these people she felt
suddenly very tired even though she had slept
well in duncans tiny hat-box of a house   

  last night    could she ever forget that
nightmare or-did she really want to for-
get it at least when she was like last night
there were no silly scenes like the one just
acted out

fphe queer little man with the funny brown
shoes sat in a chair in the corner of the hall-
way he rose as they came toward him and

shuffled his battered hat quite foolishly in his
haads

  he peered owlishly at marion back eh
good thing he had a gold-filled smile which
did nothing for his personality had these
folks mighty worried miss carter

  when no one introduced him he took care
of it himself im hamilton pine police de-
partment and flashed a badge

  now see here pine roger southern
said

  wont take a moment doctor he said
when your folks called up last night the sta-
tion police didnt pay much attention to the
call biit i figured id drop out here early this
morning just in case you know miss carter
theres still a few things wed like to clear up
about mr johnsons death and wed like to
know that youre available for questioning-
theres nothing to clear up joseph bill-
ing inserted his hugeness between marion and
the little detective the coroners inquiry
determined it was an accidental death

  pine nodded so i heard but i still got
my opinions and the cornor isnt in charge of
homicide harry johnson was shot to death
out in the woods no witnesses all we find
is a gun beside him anybody-even a woman
-could have plucked him off

  dammit man are you suggesting-
look said pine its common gossip that
this miss carter has no great love for her step-
father since that time he breaks up her ro-
mance with that flyer fellow last year and
miss carter is also inclined to-er- he
looked hard searchingly at marion-go a
little out of her head at time

  pine ill have your badge for libel bill-
ing roared

  marion looked from the little man to dun-
can who was standing in the doorway his
lean face splashed with shadows there were
shadows in his eyes too she thought as he
regarded her silently

  the detective was still grinning when he
walked to the door nodded at no one in par-
ticular and sauntered out

  duncan said perhaps-perhaps it would
be best if i called another time marion ill
look in on you in a day or so and quickly
vanished from the doorway

  marion heard the roar of his cars motor
in the drive she was sure that she had seen
him for the last time   

  bright and early on the following morning
duncan macclure proved her wrong he ar-
rived with a bunch of wild flowers hed picked
for her and the next day when the butler
announced him marion took a few minutes to
dab her cheeks and brighten her lips with lip-
stick duncan was gay and friendly and made
her feel so much better that she was amazed
the third day he phoned suggesting that
blind date with the devil

 

she go riding with him marion found herself
eager for his company-to get away from the
house the only relief throughout the days
was when she saw duncan idlewood had come
to be unbearable with its austere loneliness
and whispering shadows that hovered every-
where she didnt dare let her fears take shape
in her mind but the battle was growing into
too great a one for her to carry done

  she was ready a full ten minutes before
duncan arrived in the car he said

  ive been doing a little snooping marion
and she felt the surge of fear in her breast
im sure i can help you he went on if
only youll let me

  really she pleaded theres nothing
you can do-

  there must be his vehemence almost
took them off the road no girl as young and
pretty as you goes around trying to kick her
life away is it a man  he asked

  yes she thought it is a man a man named
harry johnson he is dead and maybe i
killed him i dont know i dont know dont
drag it out into the open duncan please

  she caught herself in time no its not a
man duncan i dont know why i-

  but there must be a reason why youve
tried twice to kill yourself marion

  they were in the village now the quiet
quaint old new england village with its
funny scattered shops and silent people he
stopped the car in front of a combination
blacksmith shop and garage why dont you
try telling me about it

  suddenly she found herself talking

  i dont know how to describe it duncan
its as if there were a voice inside of me
telling me to destroy myself both times ive
been alone at night i wake up only its as if
im still asleep and dreaming a nightmare
theres a haze like a faint fog-it suffocates
me everything and everyone is too much to
bear-i want to get away from the death-
smelling house from my room from jan and
roger and mr billing im-im afraid of
them    this voice tells me that the river is
my only friend and that i should go there its
so awfully hard to think duncan theres

nst this voice-which is not a voice really
know-and the queer feeling in the pit of
my stomach as if im going to be dreadfully
skk her voice was less controlled she
found the sobs were crowding into the words

  but why he asked why did harrys
death mean so much to you 

  it was a shock i respected him and hed
been awfully good to janis and me hed
saved me from making a fool of myself over
some man who was infatuated with my
money-

  ive talked with pine he seems to think
that was why you hated harry johnson

  but i didnt hate him she sobbed

che stopped feeling peculiarly uneasy her
 stomach fluttered slightly her nostrils
quivered against the odor which was sicken-
ing her

  ugh she sniffed that smelllets

get away from here duncan i cant stand
it-reminds me of the warm suffocating odor
the nights when   

  he sniffed too then looked into the black-
smith shop a drift of the odor moved lazily
on the faint breeze he must be having
trouble with his draft in there youre right
it is awful

  they drove back to idlewood in silence
where janis roger and mr billings were
having tea duncan declined an invitation to
join them but finally promised to come to
dinner that evening

  marion walked to the door with him not
wanting him to go she knew shed be afraid
without him she was hardly prepared for
the way he wrapped his strong tweed clad
arm around her and drew her close his lips
searched briefly found hers and was gone

  she was more upset by duncans quick em-
brace than she had been by his telling her
that he had been asking questions in the vil-
lage and she was far from happy that janis
had insisted he come back for dinner

  janis stopped at her room that night to
see if she were ready to go down for dinner
marion hadnt dressed she was lying across
her bed clad in her faded blue bathrobe

  really marion janis said i thought
youd be all excited about tonight

  marion closed her eyes tightly to keep
her fear from showing im not coming
down i dont want-

  but darling you must her younger
sisters voice held the softest note of sympathy
i wouldnt have invited him-

  stop it jan i dont want to see him do
you hear she flung her face into the pro-
tective shadows of the pillow sobbing

  janis hand found her shoulder comforting-
ly marion you cant make me believe what
youre saying

  jan oh jan marion sobbed i cant see
him again

  but darling why

  you must know marion said fiercely a
mirthless smile became a snarl upon her lips

  how can i think of loving anyone or
letting anyone love me im not a normal
young woman-im marion carter dont you
remember the girl the police think killed
her step-father

 but-

  no let me finish she grew calmer now
btit since she had started talking she was no
longer afraid to say what she had to say


john bender

twice ive tried to kill myself-you know
that well what assurance do i have that i
wont try to do it again  how do i know i-
her eyes grew larger at the sudden contem-
plation which rose to plague her- how do
i know that one of these strange spells wont
come over me and make me kill not myself-
but duncan or you  or roger-

  stop it marion stop it i her younger
sisters hand lashed out and caught her across
the face leaving the reddened imprint of her
fingers on the whiteness of the skin youre
not going to help yourself like this youre
not going to kill anyone do you hear me
tenderly janis placed her arm around her
sisters shoulder youve got to snap out
of it come on now be a good girl 
marion felt weak spent by her outburst
she meekjy found herself submitting when
janis helped her dress but even then she
felt a chilling trepidation how long had it
been now since she had tried to kill-

  she tried to banish the thought

  when she was just about to leave mary
the maid came in to lay a few chunks of coal
beside the fireplace

  ill just take the chill off your room miss
marion the maid said

  marion thanked her and went on down-
stairs she was just in time to meet duncan
arriving his mouth opened in frank ad-
miration of her loveliness he whistled softly

  he grinned then and said something like
hubba hubba she thought he came for-
ward as if to take her in his arms

  the others were in the library sleek and
comfortable-looking in their evening clothes
roger impeccable as ever wore a splash of
colored lapel decorations hed acquired in
the war drinks were served and marion
found duncan watching her queerly

she felt uncomfortable as if something were
going to happen at any moment
was this to be another night of horror  
just after dinner when they were having
their coffee and liquer duncan exploded the
bombshell he held aloft his tiny glass

  a toast he told the others gaily he
looked at marion for a moment the ghost of
a smile in his eyes his glass dipped to her in
a salute to the future mrs duncan mac-
clurel

fphere was a stir of excitement around the
room marion looked with startled eyes at
the faces there they were looking to her for
confirmation she saw duncans glance eager
strangely mutely pleading and again the
surge of uneasiness filled her

  how nice janis said finally how very
nice she beamed from her sister to duncan
congratulations

  then everyone babbled she tried to speak

into the small sea of sound but her voice was
swept away by duncans next speech

  we intended to keep it a secret for a while
longer but- he grinned at them though
the glance he gave marion was secretive
bidding her not to interrupt his hand found
hers squeezed it hard well fact of the
matter is ill be leaving here shortly and
taking marion with me-

  leaving roger asked where to
ive got a commission to do some murals
in san francisco

  billing nodded heavily but need you two
just pack oif-

  its quite necessary duncan said firmly
itll take a good six months to do the work
he drew marion to him briefly then made
apologies to the others for his sudden haste
in leaving in the hall he stopped her ques-
tions with a softly-laid finger on her lips

  i know i was rather abrupt but youve
got to believe me i love you i want you to
marry me he grinned his pleasant lop-
sided grin dont rush into it-if you want
time to think about it   i-i couldnt resist
the chance to be dramatic in there-

  but duncan you dont know me-you
dont know what its like for me-

  i know this he said firmly he kissed
her

  see what i mean  he said

  downstairs the clock struck three in the
solemn booming notes that tore through her
and she knew with one part of her mind that
she had been in bed for four hours now she
had felt surprisingly fine after duncan had
gone she had gone to bed far happier than
she had been anytime since harry had died

  had she slept she wondered she had no
recollection of a lapse of time or the unaware-
ness that usually is associated with sleep in
the darkness she had lain listening despite
herself to the sounds the old house made to
the creaking which told her that the house
was settling for the night

  am i alone she wondered   

  the question thrilled her immensely it be-
came suddenly important that she find out if
there was anyone else in the big house hwrry
she thought i must hurry or they will find
me and put me bock in bed and roger will be
called and he will give me a sleeping pill

  quickly she flung the covers away and
leaped out onto the thickly-carpeted floor she
moved quickly and lithely-unaware of her
strange beauty in the pale moonlight which
seeped into a corner of the room perhaps two
or three steps from the bed she stumbled but
did not fall

  she remembered only vaguely the last
time-the time when she had almost suc-
ceeded she remembered but with a thick
furry edge upon her thoughts so that it was
blind date with the devil

less a memory than an instinct who had
stopped her   

  crossing the room she caught faint sight
of herself in the full-length mirror for a
moment a wave of weakness assailed her and
she stood wavering in the darkness over near
the wall on her quivering legs she made
for the door the first wave of sickness clutch-
ing at her no she thought i must not get
sick i

  she turned the knob and stepped outside
into the corridor there were no sounds in
the house the long carpeted corridor which
led to the staircase wore not a light

   if only i dont get sick   

  moving slowly with almost exaggerated
physical attempts at silence she reached the
stairs it was growing clearer in her mind
despite the nausea she knew exactly what
she had to do now outside she could race
to the river even now she could see the
moonlight on the bridge and the water-the
cool inviting water

  within a minute she had reached the front
door and was out through it the night was
not very cold but with the sickness in her she
felt a chill her heart was racing wildly and
a reckless urgency made her move more quick-
ly she felt the sharp ground

  she was free free at last

  marion 

  the voice chased her then she heard the
footsteps pounding behind a pair of arms
clamped about her despite her struggles she
could not break free

  marion stop it the voice commanded

  she struggled all the more now she must
get to the river she must

  the hold on her relaxed momentarily she
tried to twist away but another person had
come up to hold her

  take care of her she heard ill get
him the voice moved away bring her
inside  

  against the rising sickness in her she was
helpless she could fight no longer quite
suddenly things began to whirl and a cloak
of sudden darkness smothered her

sphere was a faint slap slap noise-a hand
-spatting her cheek marion realized she
tried to bring her eyes into focus and gradually
she was able to make out the figure of janis
sitting next to the couch on which she lay

  as from a distance marion heard duncans
voice

  so thats how it was he used adamsite
gas which he picked up while he was still
in the army its a well known fact that
adamsite will cause a temporary mental de-
pression as well as a sickness physically and
since it smells just like coal gas no one would

ever guess that it was present marion was
upset over harry johnsons death it worked
making her try to commit suicide

  hamilton pine who stood at the far end
of the room with mr billings said slowly
then you think thats how johnson was
killed too

  probably duncan told him but im
only guessing there i know he used it on
marion we caught him trying to get that gas
cartridge out of marions fireplace

   it was unbelievable at first billings said
pine nodded slowly a new one on me
it wasnt so very unusual duncan said
he saw a shortcut to a fortune by marrying
janis but he had to kill johnson and then
get rid of marion so that janis would in-
herit  i just speeded things up a little
tonight by saying that marion and i were
going to be married-which would have put
another person in his way you see so he
had to act fast

  fully conscious now marion realized they
had been talking about roger she looked at
janis saw the well of tears in her sisters
eyes saw a battered roger southern sprawled
in a chair where pine could watch him
marion duncan had turned to her
things were spinning in her head roger-
a murderer poor janis    and from
somewhere came the horrible knowledge that
once again she too was alone-that duncans
telling her he loved her was all part of the
weird affair no wonder hed made all that
show of affection hed been using her as a
bait in his trap

   well ive got it all straight i think said
pine nodding dubiously to roger he said
okay bo lets go-before i let mr mac-
clure work on you some more

  the little detective herded his prisoner out
then janis and billing left the room

  kneeling beside marion duncan said soft-
ly we had a doctor with us too he says
youll be all right marion hes gone to get
a car to take you to the hospital he paused
im sorry that pine and i couldnt have
cooked up anything better-

  you were waiting outside tonight she
said dully feeling that she must say some-
thing to hide her aching heart

  yes darling

  darling was it just a word

  something must have told him what was
going on inside of her

  darling he said again this time much
more reverently a few days-a week at the
most-and youll be fit as a fiddle he grin-
ned and touched her shoulder tenderly ill
need that much time wont i to arrange for
the license and things   
  dead men

        to the gilded playboys-and play gals-the colony plaza
        offered the height of luxury but to one man that fabulous
        chrome-and-plush hostelry was a maze of sheer terror with

shelf flicked it open

chapter one
trail of the hunted

snips mcglynn spotted garvey one of
the house dicks and jolly mr frazer
coming into tne barber shop of the swank
colony plaza hotel at the same time he
swung his chair-number eight-invitingly
to frazer not that he had anything against
garvey it was just that mr frazer who was

reputed to own a flock of mexican gold mines
was a liberal tipper and when a guy is plan-
ning on marrying a cute little manicurist like
tillie brady he has to look at things like that

  snips saw mr frazer give him the nod and
stepped back politely glanced down the gleam-
ing shop to where tillies fluffy golden head




william rough

was bent demurely over a customers hands
she didnt notice snips because she kept her
mind on her work and her nail file was brisk

  snips grinned happily then stiffened lew
polio the shop manager had seen him glanc-
ing at tillie and the dapper mans dark eyes
glittered hotly he danced forward caught
mr frazers plump arm and simpered take
number four sir

  mr frazer shrugged amiably and pulled his
favorite gag long and fluffy on top bar-
ber sheik style around the ears he was bald
as a golf ball

  the barbers tittered politely not snips
his small thin features were tight his neat
soft hands were knots at the sides of his
starched white coat lew polio couldnt fire
him because snips rated the job after three
years in the army but lew was trying to
make things so miserable that snips would
quit by rights snips rated chair three lew
had stuck him at the end on number eight
sneering that a thin-haired squirt was bad ad-
vertising for any barber shop and snips should
keep out of sight towards the back

  lew steered every good tipper away from
snips made dirty cracks and wasnt even
above bumping snips arm when he was shav-
ing someone and then hissing butcher
but this was the blow-off snips started for
him lew wanted him to quit so okay he
would but hed do it up brown-hed smash
lews nose all over his olive-skinned puss

  hard fingers closed on snips biceps it was
the house man garvey shave he grunt-
ed snap it up

  it still wouldnt have been enough to stop
snips by itself but just then tillie finished
her party and looked up with a smile that was
all for him that stopped him he guessed it
would always make him catch his breath when
tillie smiled for him she was blonde blue-
eyed red-lipped just five feet two and every-
thing that he wanted if he lost the job it
would take just that much longer to get to-
gether a nest egg for tillie

  he pulled his smarting eyes away from lew
polio slung a bib around garveys leathery
neck and stropped his razor making the steel
slap-slap the leather viciously he caught
himself no use taking it out on the fine swiss
steel it was the keenest and best balanced
razor in the shop a gi pal had picked it up
overseas for snips snips hadnt got out of
the country himself hed cut hair at camp
pickett all the time which made him a little
bashful about wearing his discharge button
he carried it in his wallet though just in
case anybody doubted him

  he brandished the razor blurted wildly
wouldnt i just like to get lew polio under
this

  huh garveys shrewd eyes bored up at

him fora second then garvey laughed it
was funny-then

  snips got garvey out of the chair finally
and slid down the aisle to whisper to tillie
honey that green smock makes you look like
a million lew polios glittering eyes fol-
lowed him every inch of the way but the man
said nothing til he was on his way up to the
hotel to shave gordon maxe a bigshot guest
then he stopped at tillies table and hissed
something tillies eyes flashed wide her
soft mouth trembled snips knew that lew
had made another crack of some kind there
was only one thing to do poke lew and take
tillie out of this shop

  snips would have raced after lew and done
it right there only he had someone in his
chair he no sooner got rid of him than an-
other customer plopped down

   snips scissors clicked his razor flashed his
hands dug the customers scalp while he was
working the telephone rang the shine boy
answered it announced fo mist garvey
that mrs lockridge burnard on twenty-two
say a fight goin on outside her door

  mr frazer whooped from under a hot towel
hurry it up son  i gotta be a knight to the
rescue of my lady fair he laughed like it
was a good one and snips recalled shop gos-
sip about the wealthy widowed mrs burnard
trying to buy a piece of mr frazers gold
mines shed had her cap set for gordon
maxe till mr frazer showed up then shed
switched to him

  it didnt mean anything to snips he
whisked the bib off his party and scooted down
to tillie hon what did lew say fo you

  forget it snipsy but her smile was
tight

  you tell me snips burst

  dont you order me around were not
married yet tillie flared oh all right
then he said he wants a date with me to-
night or he-hell give me notice

  snips whirled

  tillie squeaked snipsy what are you go-
ing to dov

<T>ust lews nose and take you out of
here snips yelled shucking his white
coat as he skidded back to his chair he
slapped his razor into its case shoved it into
his hip pocket he knew he wouldnt be work-
ing in this shop any more he grabbed his
street coat crammed his natty white panama
hat down hard and charged through the door
that led up to the huge marble hotel lobby he
was five feet five a hundred and forty pounds
but people got out of his way

  lew polio would be finished shaving gor-
don maxe by this time and had probably
sneaked down to his own room for a drink
or something snips barged into an elevator
dead men ddnt bleed



cab snapped fifteen the elevator oper-
ator carl pence shuffled what you going
up there for snips he wore a natty blue
tunic and trousers which failed to smarten up
his pimpled face and receding chin snips
ddint answer his heels dug marks in the
luxurious carpeting when he sprang out on
the fifteenth floor he got to lew polios
door and spanked it with tight knuckles

  there was no answer and snips shouted
i know youre in there open up he
grabbed the doorknob rattled it it gave the
door opened-and yes lew was inside all
right hed be inside from now on-inside
a grave

  snips didnt understand it right off all he
saw was lews crumpled figure on the floor
lews white coat was mussed and awry his
dark eyes were wide open his olive skin
was pasty

  snips was paralyzed for a second then he
started forward he didnt try to dive but
thats what he did-headfirst into the floor
the reason was that he was helped from
behind by a sap or something equally brutal
it caught him behind the ear and he plunged
into blackness

  snips dreamed that tillie was giving him
a manicure he felt liquid nail polish on his
fingers it wouldnt dry right it seemed and
finally tillie applied quick-drying fluid on top
of it with little cotton swabs and then of all
things put the cotton in snips mouth

  he sputtered tried to spit it out it clung
to his lips and the liquid on his fingers still
didnt dry it got sticky

  suddenly he sat up and bleared at his hands
he groaned what was wrong with tillie
putting red polish on a mans nails well
that would come off quick snips swiped his
hands on his pants the polish wasnt dry at
that and wiped off easily but it made sticky
streaks on the backs of his fingers and these
picked up cotton there was cotton still in his
mouth too dam it snips blew saw a piece
of it dance off his lips and float airily

  he scowled who ever heard of a cotton
swab floating in the air his eyes focussed
then he understood it wasnt cotton at all it
was a feather

  sure there were feathers clinging to his
hands too now where in heck had they come
from 

  he tried to stand slopped on his face he
pushed up on hands and knees and smelled a
strong aromatic odor of some kind he saw
where it came from-lew polios white bar-
ber jacket he couldnt help seeing his face
was only six inches from lew now and lew
had red nail polish on his neck lots of red
nail polish a crimson lake of it

  mother mary snips burst and put all
hfe strength into pushing away he fell back

scrambled to his feet lungs laboring it wasnt
mil polish on lew polios neck at all-it was
red red blood it came from a gash that
made a semi-circle under lews chin from
jawline to jawline someone had cut lews
throat

   snips caught at the bed to keep from floun-
 dering it seemed that there was no place to
 put his feet except in blood and feathers the
 room was a shambles as if a rugged fight had
 taken place and the feathers came from a
 bursted pillow

   they were strewn all over the carpet and
 furniture the free ones swirled in the air
 currents but the ones that had touched the
 red liquid especially under lews chin had
 stuck and clung

   snips breathing stopped then he gagged
 hed heard of men being tarred and feathered
 -lew polio was bloodied and feathered

   ships wanted out-fast he lurched toward
 the door then he saw it the razor beside
 lews body his razor

   snips clutched at his hip pocket but it
 wasnt necessary he knew that the razor
 couldnt be in two places at the same time if
 it was on the floor beside lew it couldnt be
 in its case nor was it snips spied the case
 across the room he felt numb lews throat
 had been slashed with snips own razor

   the door crashed open behind snips gar-
 veys gravel voice ordered dont move
 boy a second later he grunted mcglynn
 ill be damned you meant it when you said
 youd like to cut his throat

   no snips screamed i didnt i didnt
 mean it and i didnt do it he was like that
 when i came in only his throat wasnt cut 

   hagh garvey spat

   snips wailed honest garvey somebody
 knocked me out and used my razor

   you admit its your razor garvey shot

   youd find out anyhow snips gulped i
 had it in my pocket i was going to quit
 working at the shop so i brought it along

  garvey sandpapered a leathery cheek
thoughtfully thats it then you came up
here to even things with lew before you quit
the room here says you had a good fight he
started to get the best of you and you pulled
the razor

   arvey nodded satisfied snips trembled

    he was caught sweet garvey or any cop
 for that matter would swear he had motive
 opportunity and the weapon the best lawyer
 in the country couldnt argue those away even
 if snips put himself in debt for years to hire
 one

   garvey said glumly open and shut dam-
 mit  

   snips brain whirled garvey once had run
  his own detective agency but hadnt made out
william rough

he was biding his time as house dick here at
the colony plaza hoping for a big case so
that hed get his name in the pagers and be
able to capitalize on it and start up for himself
again

  garvey snips blurted listen if you
arrest me the casell be closed right away
there wont be any publicity for you at all
but if you let me get away and then catch me
itll be better for you honest to gawd i wont
run out on you ill meet you anywhere you
say just so i get a chance to find the guy
who really did this will you do it garvey
please 

  the house dicks eyes flickered snips could
see that garvey was weighing the proposition

  honest garvey ill keep in touch with
you snips promised what brought you
up here anyhow

  garvey grunted somebody called down
and said there was noise here i didnt hurry
had another call about noise from mrs burn-
ard a while back and there was no sign of it
when i got to her floor

  but there wasnt any noise here snips
cried look the furniture is turned over
but its not broken there wasnt any fight
lew was out cold on the floor when i came
in and the room was okay somebody slugged
me then made it look like thered been a fight
and cut lews throat it must have happened
that way give me a fair shake garvey

  garveys gun hand relaxed a little he
frowned still trying to make up his mind

  please snips pleaded

  garvey scowled shook his head nup
cant do i want a build up not down theyd
ride hell out of me for letting a squirt like
you lam

  snips clenched his fists opened his mouth
to argue some more he closed it felt his
shoulders sag it was no use he was licked

  no he yelled-and jumped garvey

  he was operating on instinct now hed
tried to use his head and it hadnt worked
his fists were all that were left he wasnt
big but he was compact and wiry and he had
strength in his wrists and forearms

  too garvey wasnt expecting action and
had eased up there was more surprise than
pain in his first oof as snips left hooked
into his jaw

  snips felt his knuckles on the bone of gar-
veys face struck again the house man spat
a curse pulled back and slashed out with his
gun barrel it raked snips collar bone

  snips bleated in pain felt himself careen
off balance and start down he flung out both
hands trying to grab garvey anywhere he
missed garveys waist and chest but his arms
were still out in a half circle when his knees
hit the floor his soft but strong hands
scraped down garveys thighs snips felt the

mans legs getting thinner as he dropped his
hands when he got to garveys ankles they
were thin enough to hang onto snips hung

  then he felt garvey lurch he yanked on
both garveys ankles garvey spilled back-
wards the floor shook as the house cops
beam hit it he howled and thrashed around
snips sent strength to his knees and came up
he kicked just once straight and true and
sent garveys  clunking across the room
then he made tracks

  out the door down the corridor down the
first flight of front stairs around the cor-
ridor on the next landing and back to the serv-
ice stairs snips knew the hotel layout of old
he was twisting and backtracking instinctive-
ly but driving ever closer to the ground floor
exits

chapter two

a helping hand

hphen it hit him hed started on the fif-
teenth floor all garvey had needed to do
was call the desk and warn the other house
cops theyd be deployed in the lobby and
even at the rear of the hotel and one of them
them would be outside wising up the patrol-
men in the vicinity the second snips put
foot outside if he got that far hed be shot
at or slugged

  he cowered on a staircase he had to bide
in the hotel at least till the hunt died down
what else could he do

  his breathing he knew was loud enough to
attract attention from anyone near him he
tried to stop it control it but it was no good
by a miracle his white panama hat hadnt
slid off through it all it was because he didnt
have much hair and he always pulled it on
tight he took it off now held it over his
mouth to cut down the wheeze of his lungs
it didnt help

  they think im on the way down he
panted ill go 

  he reversed his field pumped back up the
stairs one flight two flights he was back
on twelve again there was no thirteenth
floor in a hotel so the next one was numbered
fourteen snips halted flesh crawling he
couldnt risk passing fifteen again the floor
would be alive with house cops he shivered
where could a guy hide one of the rooms
sure but which one 

  snips breathed mr frazer lives in 
and hes not in  the jolly bald man had
left the barber shop to go to mrs bumards
suite on twenty-two snips remembered he
didnt think any further than that mr frazer
was the kind of guy whod leave his door un-
locked too all snips wanted was sanctuary
till his heart stopped pounding
dead men dont bleed



  he scuttled up the remaining steps to four-
teen scanned the corridor found it empty and
slid down to  the door was unlocked
snips went into the suite like a gopher whisk-
ing into a hole he leaned his shivery back
against the door and tried to keep his remain-
ing strength from dribbling away his lungs
made harsh laboring sounds tlien quieted a
little and something suspiciously like a sob
trickled from his parched lips what was he
to do now

  his knees were too wobbly to support him
he flopped in a chair there was no meaning
to it yet hed been framed for lew polios
murder why why would anyone want to
kill lew in the first place that the killer
would frame someone who didnt get along
with lew was understandable enough but why
kill him in the first place miserable as lew
had been he hadnt seemed the type to get
his throat cut

  unless there was something crooked about
him being flush lately snips mumbled to
himself lew made a good salary as shop
manager but the past few weeks hed been
spending plenty hed bought new suits and
had taken a suite here in the hotel and hed
bought a new car he must have been in
something crooked snips nodded hed
had a fight or something with the guys hes
in it with and they rubbed him out then saw
a chance to frame me and did it

  snips nodded vigorously after lew had
shaved gordon maxe and come to his own
room hed met someone who had slugged
him this someone had either stayed inside
the room or waited around outside and see-
ing snips stomp up to lews door had got-
ten him then cut lews throat with snips
razor and faked a fight scene which was
plenty realistic

  snips recalling the bloody feathers shivered
he saw three or four of them still clinging to
his jacket and pants he snatched them off
and saw that his hands were still sticky
though there wasnt too much blood on his
clothing he started for the bathroom to get
the stuff cleaned off he brushed the red-dyed
feathers into the commode one of them missed
it snips picked it out of the air felt it be-
tween thumb and forefinger something
clanged warningly in his head

  he fingered the feather searched his pants
for another found one in a cuff he com-
pared the two one was dry and clean and
softly brittle the other seemed more pliable
moistish and soiled

tt was important snips knew without

  quite knowing why he cudgeled his brain
for the answer but couldnt grasp it he
wrapped the feathers in a handkerchief start-
ed to wash up he was a little steadier now

which was lucky-for suddenly a nattily uni-
formed man had come up behind him

  snips saw the mans pimpled face and re-
ceding chin in the mirror over the washbowl
as the man jumped him it was carl pence
the elevator operator

  gotcha snips carl yelled

  snips had a liar of soap in his hand he
writhed around and smacked it wetly at the
pimples he missed the first time and carl
pence opened his mouth in a laugh

  snips jabbed out again with the bar of
soap it traveled straight and true and
rammed into carls mouth right back to his
tonsils carl tried to choke it out failed and
clawed at it he had only one hand free
snips batted it aside and whipped a stinger to
carls stomach that kicked the soap out of
carls mouth together with a tortured
ughl--

  you want-more carl snips challenged
breaking clean and cocking his fists

  carl shrank away blubbering soapy saliva
that drooled down on his neat blue tunic he
made no effort to continue brawling in fact
he looked at snips as if hed bitten off more
than he could chew

  snips stuck out his chest he wasnt used
to such respect punk he leered at carl
how did you know i was in mr frazers
suite

  i didnt honest carl snatched a towel
and swabbed his chin his pale eyes were
skittery i just came in to see mr frazer
about    something i seen you here and
knew the cops are after you

  so you thought youd be a big shot and
nab me snips cut in you thought id be
easy what did you want to see mr frazer
about

  carl eyed the door took a step toward it
snips stepped in front of him fists ready
tell me smart guy he ordered

  carl bit his lip garvey thinks maybe mr
frazer heard you in the barber shop when
you threatened to cut lews throat i said
id come up and get mr frazer is all

  snips cried i didnt threaten to cut lews
throat i was just burned up and made a
crack jeez a guy dont have a chance 

  he quivered this was always what hap-
pened when you shot off your mouth for a
second he knew what it was like to hate cops
and the way they built up a case against you
garvey would get fat jolly mr frazer to
swear he had heard the threat and mr frazer
was just the kind of guy a jury would cer-
tainly believe

  snips burst but a jury would believe mr
frazer if he was for me too i gotta see him
first

  snips started to turn remembered carl he
couldnt let carl walk out and run for garvey


william rough

he wet his lips hey look at yourself in the
mirror carl

  huh carl turned curiously snips hit
him behind the ear smartly with the edge of
a stiff palm hed never had any jiu jitsui
training himself but hed seen other gis
practising it and had wanted to try it he
watched carl pence crumple boy he mar-
veled it sure works

  he was going to let carl lay and just lock
the bathroom door but mr frazer was up
in mrs burnards suite on the twenty-second
floor and snips had to get up there without
attracting attention he peeked out into the
corridor saw carls elevator cab with the
door open and went back and pulled off the
mans blue uniform coat and trousers he got
into them himself dragged carl out of the
bathroom to a bedroom closet and tied him
with mr frazers shoe laces a few moments
later he was zooming up in the elevator

  he skinned the car doors open on the
twenty-second floor and rapped on  mrs
lockridge burnard opened the door herself
she was small blonde well-dressed and for
a second snips hoped that tillie would hold up
as well when she was fifty then mrs burn-
ard said yes and looked back over her
shoulder and giggled and snips changed his
mind he didnt want tillie ever to become
coy

  he said is mr frazer here maam i
gotta see him

  mrs burnards brows climbed snips de-
cided they were much too dark and slinky
she didnt spare the make-up really she
began

air frazers voice boomed yowsuh
im here son what do you want
snips slid past the woman she looked
petulantly at frazer horace cant we be
alone

  shucks honey the kids in trouble mr
frazer said bet hes got the same kind of
trouble as us-hes in love

  mrs burnard tittered the poor thing
snips blurted thats not all of it though
they think i cut lew polios throat they
want you to testify that you heard me say id
do it in the barber shop mr frazer you
wont will you

  mrs burnard screamed horace-how
awful call the police

  shh mr frazers pink jowls were
grave now whats this all about

  snips rushed through his story while mrs
burnard fluttered and gasped mr frazier
polished his bald head with a lavender hand-
kerchief no bigger than a bath mat

  he said well son i didnt hear you
threaten to cut this polios throat

  snips gulped gee thanks i-

  mr frazier frowned but i dont see that
itll do much good your best bet it to give
yourself up and-

  i wouldnt have a chance snips bleated
ive got to find something that will clear
me

  horace im going to call the police i mrs
burnard cried

  hush lambykins mr frazier cajoled
the boy is innocent weve got to help
him he pinched his jowls thoughtfully ill
bet gordon maxe would know what to do
horace mrs burnard protested you
know i dislike that man you said yourself
that he wasnt to be trusted remember  you
suspected that he was just being nice to me
to sell me stock in a worked-out gold mine
true true mr frazer admitted but
i knew him in mexico and hes had legal ex-
perience-so long as were on guard against
him were safe he turned to snips come
along son and well see mr maxe hes
shrewd and hell advise you what to do just
in the hope that it will put him in solid with
me and mrs burnard

  snips licked his lips he didnt know what
to do but when mr frazer slung a friendly
arm over his shoulders and steered him
toward the door he went along mr frazer
had the right idea maybe you cant always
get out of trouble by yourself youve got to
look for men who know the ropes

  hes on twenty-eight mr frazer said
in the corridor

  ive got an elevator snips said i met
carl pence the operator in your suite sir
and- please dont get sore-i tied him up in
your closet

  mr frazers jaws could get hard in spite
of their fat i dont know as i like that
son he growled what were either one of
you doing in my place

  i went there to hide snips said apol-
ogetically he said he came up to take you
to garvey as a witness against me i couldnt
let him walk out then could i

  but theyll notice his elevator isnt run-
ning and- mr frazer broke off eyeing the
elevator indicators one of them hovered at
 even now

  snips saw it and jerked looked wildly up
and down the corridor the door of a mop
closet was a great deal closer than the ele-
vator bank snips dived for it hissing
maybe somebodys coming to see why the cab
is stuck on this floor

  he was right hed no sooner pulled the
closet door nearly shut than an elevator
operator got out of his cab and peered at carl
pences car

  hey mister the man called to mr
frazer seen anything of the guy who runs
this crate
dead men dont bleed



  no son i havent mr frazer replied
the elevator operator sighed hell get
hell for loafing around iu report his cab
up here everything happens at once dont it
a barber cuts a guys throat they catch a guy
stealing chickens in the kitchen and with
cops all over the place carl has to lay down
on the job

  the man clanged his doors again mr
frazer caded softly okay son

chapter three
jaws of the trap

tut snips head was whirling something
was trying to click into place it was
the mention of chickens being stolen in the
kitchen that had tightened him up there was
no sense to it yet some deep intuition was at
work snips shook his head the feathers
all around lew polios body must have made
him sensitive to anything that smacked of
them such as chickens

  hurry son mr frazer urged

  yessir snips started out of the closet
skidded a little caught himself he saw that
hed slipped on white powder that had spilled
from a can of deodorant he smelled the
familiar tang of the strong aromatic odor but
it wasnt until he and mr frazer were shoot-
ing up in the elevator that it connected he
blurted why thats the same stuff i smelled
on lew polios coat in the room when i
found him

  whassat son mr frazer said

  snips shook his head i dont know sir
honest theres something i should be able
to figure out but i cant what was going on
outside mrs burnards suite when she called
for garvey

  mr frazies waved carelessly she said
she heard a fight there but no one saw any-
thing and she hadnt looked out herself heres
maxes floor

  snips tried to swallow the lump under his
tongue as he followed mr frazer to  he
had to trust someone he supposed but hed
never seen this gordon maxe and mr frazer
himself had told mrs bumard that maxe was
trying to promote phony mine stock

  mr frazer opened the door calling gor-
don   there was no answer and the fat man
peered into the bedroom came back frowning
maxe must have stepped out son he told
snips mm but we cant leave that ele-
vator car on this floor or someone will come
snooping suppose you wait here while i get
rid of it

  snips swallowed all r-right sir

  mr frazer waddled toward thecorridor
door again paused another thing he said
thoughtfully we cant let carl pence stay

tied up in my suite tell you what he can
probably be bought cant he

  snips nodded

  good mr frazer said if im going to
help you i want to do it right shuck out of
that uniform son and ill untie pence and give
it back to him ill pay him to keep his mouth
shut for a couple hours at least and bring your
own clothes up here to you

snips hesitated it sounded logical yet   
mr frazer advised maybe mr maxe will
think your best bet is to get out of the hotel
and you wouldnt get far in that uniform
without somebody spotting you

  it was the clinching argument snips pulled
off the natty blue tunic stepped out of the
trousers mr frazer scooped them up if
maxe comes back before i do son just tell
him your story and that i brought you here
keep your chin out now

  mr frazer shut the door snips stood in
the middle of the sitting room in his jockey
shorts and shirt he shivered but not from
lack of clothing he realized that hed en-
trusted mr frazer with his fate and every-
thing now depended on the fat man

  there was gordon maxe too snips won-
dered again what kind of man maxe was
maybe hed refuse to help maybe hed take
one look at snips and call garvey mr
frazer seemed like a jovial sort whod give a
man a hand but that didnt prove maxe would

  there was nothing to do but wait and see
snips paced back and forth he felt like look-
ing for a dressing gown or something but if
maxe came in and saw him wearing his cloth-
ing it might rub him the wrong way the
best thing was to look helpless maybe

  but there was no trick to looking helpless
snips knew that was exactly how he felt he
tried again to figure out what had tightened
him up earlier when the elevator operator
who had come looking for carl had men-
tioned chickens being stolen in the kitchen
suddenly he had an idea he went to the tele-
phone and called the barber shop asked for
tillie when she answered then gasped
oh honey im so worried about you snips
felt ashamed that he hadnt got in touch with
her sooner she certainly had known that he
was being hunted as a murderer

wtillie i didnt do it he gulped

     whatever they say i didnt do it
honey i know you didnt i trust you
snipsy but what did happen where are
you

  snips said automatically im in gordon
maxes suite hon ive been framed for lews
murder i want you to do something for me
find out what happened in the kitchen will
you somebody stole chickens i think but
find out see who it was and whats going on


william rough

hon hurry call me back here or ill call
you

  ill do it snipsy but-

  snips didnt hear the rest he sensed the
corridor door opening saw a lean black shoe-
string of a man slipping in and pronged the
telephone he kept his hand on it though
it was the only weapon handy

  he stuttered y-youre-are you mr
maxe

  the mans deep-sunk dark eyes were glitter-
ing coals his lipst under a slash of black
mustache scarcely moved as he purred
thats the name im using at the present
yes his gaze raked snips bare shanks
and you are our little patsy i take it i
met frazer outside and he told me he left you
here youll do nicely little man

  ill do-nicely snips cried im your
patsy i d-dont know what you m-meanl
the lean dark man snicked the lock on the
door with a flat metallic sound he came
toward snips his long thin arms flexing like
the feelers on a skinny black bug the deep
grooves running from the corners of his thin
lips to his nostrils told that he was no longer
young yet his hair was black and thick and
bushy

  he said silkily dont you understand little
man

  snips started to breath faster i do under-
stand i understand some of it anyhow you
and mr frazer are in something together
mrs burnard said that mr frazer told her
not to trust you but that was just a gag he
brought me right up here for some reason
maxe grinned an old dodge but still
effective he said frazer throws suspicion
on me and mrs burnard thinks he rescued
her and trusts him more

  snips nerves were screaming but he could-
nt move you and frazer are after mrs
burnards money  he squeaked  but where
did lew polio come in you killed him didnt
you

  why not at all maxe murmured mur-
der is a crime you killed polio you slit
his throat garvey found you right there
but let you get away-i should have slugged
you harder little man

  snips felt goose pimples on his bare arms
and shoulders he crouched

  careful maxe warned leisurely he took
a compact revolver from under his should r
slanted it at snips it will look as if you got
away from garvey he explained softly and
then carl pence spotted you and tried to take
you and you pushed him out of a window
snips choked pushed him out of a win-
dow  thats a lie i tied him up in mr
frazers suite and hes still there

  maxe glanced at the watch on his skinny
wrist suppose you look out the window

  snipa-stared

  go ahead maxe encouraged frazers
had enough time to get back to his suite and
do it

  snips was fascinated he moved jerkily
to the window opened it twenty-eight stories
below a crowd had gathered in the street
huddling around a motionless thing on the
pavement the thing had been human but
was now pulp snips couldnt make out the
pimpled face and receding chin but he recog-
nized carl pences natty blue uniform he
shut his bugging eyes hard pushed away
from the window

  maxe said regretfully if only it werent
crowding things i could have shoved you on
out after him just now as it is i want to wait
a while so itll look as if you couldnt stand i
being hunted and cracked up and jumped
snips pressed his fists against his temples
with all his might why did you have to
kill carl he husked he was only an de-
vator boy

  maxes thin shoulders moved negligently
i lined him up the first day i was in the hotel j
as a kid whod like to make a dollar when
i needed an elevator today i buzzed him
flashed some dough in front of him and he was
mine

cnips cried you needed an elevator to
take lew polio from the mop closet on
 to his room on  thats itl yeah i and
later on when carl saw me go to lews room
he reported to you you hurried down and
slugged me and framed me

  maxe stroked his thick black mustache with
a yellow thumbnail pence was up to his
neck the minute he let me use his elevator
after that he had to string along the fool
bungled when he stole the chicken though
and i knew that the minute the johns worked
on him hed sing thanks for tying him up
in frazers closet for us

  snips couldnt keep his eyes off maxes
mustache and thick black hair suddenly he
saw it he burst that mustache is phony
and youre wearing a wig youre disguised 
now i know why lew polio had lots of money
lately and why you killed him and where
and when

  tell it to saint peter maxe mocked his
lean fingers lifted his gun abruptly get into
that bathroom  he lashed

  snips cursed through his tears slammed the
bathroom door viciously turned the knob that
controlled the bolt

  maxe called youre right where i want
you punk all frazer has to do to bust that
door in is lean on it

  snips put his head against the cool tile
of the bathroom wall pounded with a fist im-

potently he was trapped pretty if only
he could get out of here or get word to gar-
vey

  he prowled the bathroom nervously pray-
ing for an idea suppose he turned the shower
onto the floor wouldnt water drip through
the ceiling of the suite underneath and get
the tenant to complain 

  he shook his head the colony plaza was
a well constructed building it would take
hours for water to seep through the tile of
the bathroom floor and the plaster of the ceil-
ing below

  there was no window in the bathroom
either no chance to throw something into the
street to attract attention the only way was
the way hed come in and snips knew he
wouldnt travel three steps

  there wasnt even anything he could throw
maxes bathroom was almost as barren as if
hed just walked into the suite his shaving
kit lay on the little shelf over the washbowl
and that was all hed probably put it out
but never used it since hed enveigled lew
polio into shaving him snips opened the
shaving kit absently the straight razor was
of fair quality but not nearly as fine as snips
razor which was probably marked exhibit a
by now

  snips put his ear against the door there
was silence beyond but he was sure maxe
hadnt left by any means suddenly there was
a faint knock a chair scraped in the bed-
room snips realized that frazer was back
and had knocked at the corridor door maxe
was going to let him in

  snips waited a second till he figured maxe
was out of the bedroom walking toward the
corridor door he shot back the bolt on the
bathroom door peeked out just as maxe
opened the corridor door he expected to see
frazers belly crowd through the door but
what he saw made his blood run cold at any
other time tillie bradys blonde head trim
legs and neat green smock would have made
him glow-but not now he held his breath
praying that maxe would get rid of her that
maxe could get rid of her he knew tillie
was stubborn and-

the razor edge

tie froze maxe had shot out a clawing
hand and grabbed tillies wrist he
pulled her roughly inside

  he whirled snatched the razor off the
shelf flicked it open

  he was white hot inside but suddenly cool
on the surface he tiptoed to the bedroom

william rough

 door snatching a pillow off the bed on the
 way he had his finger up to his lips when
 tillies blue eyes flashed over maxes shoul-
 der and saw him

   she tried hard not to show surprise but
 her lips parted and maxe got it he swiveled

   snips shot-putted the pillow at the lean
 man it wasnt an accurate shot but it made
 maxe pull aside and delay his first shot a
 tenth of a second

   it was just time enough for snips to skin
 through the doorway so that he wasnt
 framed there an unmissable target it was
 the only break he could hope for the next
 dozen steps had to be straight into the gun

   he expected gun thunder and hot slams on
 his body but none came his eyes snapped
 wide again and he choked oh bon  tfflie
 had thrown herself on maxes back and was
 clawing and scratching for all she was worth
 maxe heaved and flung her aside

   snips bawled you louse- and threw
 himself on the dark man maxe twisted his
 gun hand around trying to get it up into
 snips midsection snips flicked his razor in
 a neat little arc maxe screamed in pain eyes
 bulging on his dangling thumb

   the gun hit the floor maxe struck at snips
 and tried to use his knees snips grabbed at
 the mans hair remembered too late that
 maxes hair was false his hand came away
 with a mop of black wig he started to drop
 it then swished it around and stabbed it into
 maxes face

   maxe kicked and made strangling noises
 snips got his heel behind maxes ankle
 tripped him he could hold maxe by the
 clothing but maxe couldnt hold him they
 went down and snips held the wig hard on
 maxes mouth and nose the dark mans
 struggles grew panicky he was smothering

   snips dropped his razor and struck down
 into the wig maxe went limp

   he was mouthing hot words cursing maxe
 and holding him tight as tight suddenly he
 felt tillies fingers pulling his shoulder

   she cried  snipsy snipsy youll kill him
 hes unconscious already

   snips shook his head saw that it was so
 he wrenched his hands away from maxe
 theyd been clawed so stiffly that it was hard to
 let go he rolled off the limp figure panting

   this was when frazer burst in

   snips heard the door open he was on the
 floor now he looked up and saw the fat man
 frazer took in the setup in one glance clawed
 at his armpit his snarl was more like that of
 an infuriated boar than the jovial fat man be
 had pretended to be

   but fat he was and a man so heavy could
 not make a lightning draw
dead men dont bleed

  snips had to move only a foot to get his
hand on maxes gun he did it and even
though he hadnt been overseas hed had basic
training and knew how to shoot he turned
the gun up butt in his hand which was hard
on the floor and shot three times from that
position all lie had to do was aim at the door-
way because frazer filled it then the door-
way was empty again and the fat man was
huddled over on his knees holding his clasped
hands around his middle he was still that way 
when garvey got there

  snips was straddling maxes chest when
garvey came in tillie quickly caught the
house dick and pulled him aside so that maxe
didnt see him snips flicked his razor back and
forth in front of maxes nose and slapped the
thin mans cheeks once in a while just for
good measure

  if you dont talk ill carve you snips
leered menacingly

   maxes dark eyes were skittery he couldnt
see garvey and he didnt know how far snips
would go

  you dont have to tell me snips said
ill tell you my girl just told me that a guy
was caught in the alley outside the hotel
kitchen a while ago carrying a dead chicken
in a bloody pillow slip he swears an ele-
vator boy gave it to him thats all i needed
to know this hotel buys live chickens and
you admitted before that carl pence stole one
for you

  snips looked sideways to see that garveys
leathery face was intent took a breath heres
what happened you and frazer were con
men you picked out rich widows and sold
them phony mining stock first youd make
the contact then frazer would show up and
throw suspicion on you youre not the type
yourself to pull the whole thing but if frazer
could make a dame think hed rescued her
from you shed go all-out for him the catch
is that you must be hot and you have to wear
a disguise

  snips caught a motion from garvey out of
the corner of his eye garvey was making
signs to show that snips was right and that
hed recognized maxe without the wig and
mustache

  snips nodded in satisfaction lew polio
was a barber and he spotted your fake hair
and mustache he went on waving the razor
gently in front of maxes fascinated eyes he
pulled a llttle blackmail on you and you paid

maxe burst the dirty creep he spotted
my wig off sides in the elevator one day
the next day he showed up at my room and
said hed come to shave me f could tell he
was wise so we made a deal what he -wanted

william rough

 was djicken feed compared to what we were
 going to take off mrs burnard

   thats right snips nodded thats just
 about right only later on lew got wise and
 that there was big money involved he want-
 ed a cut of that but you tried to put him off
 he got sore and said hed squawk to mrs
 burnard you thought he was bluffing but he
 wasnt and today was the day he got fed up
 and started for mrs burnards suite to spill it
 you must have seen that he was sorer than
 usual and followed him when you saw that
 he was really heading for mrs burnards you
 slugged him right outside the door she re-
 ported a fight but when garvey got there
 the corridor was empty cause why cause
 youd dragged lew into the mop closet till you
 had time to move him say no

   maxes mouth hardened snips drew his
 lips back on his teeth in a horrible grimace
 brought the razor down slowly flicked maxes
 cheek

   wait dont ill talk maxe blubbered
 youre right i didnt mean to kill him damn
 him i guess i just hit him too hard
 yeah snips agreed i knew lew had
 been parked in that mop closet because there
 were deodorant crystals spilled there and he
 had the same smell on his coat it meant that
 hed been in that closet and had been flat on
 his back at the time

   snips settled himself comfortably on maxes
 stomach the rest of it is simple you hired
 carl pence and used his elevator to take
 lews body to his room you left him there
 and probably intended to let it go but then
 carl saw me heading for lews room and told
 you and you saw a chance to frame me you
 came down and slugged me my razor fell
 out of my pocket i was a barber why not
 make it a good frame and cut lews throat
 you did but you forgot that dead men dont
 bleed

   snips wagged his head sadly it must have
 been something to cut a guys throat and not
 see any blood come out but lew had been
 dead long enough by that time for the blood
 to stop flowing in him you were in a spot
 you couldnt sew his neck back together again
 so all that was left was to get some blood
 somehow with carl pence knowing the ropes
 around the hotel you saw how it could be
 worked carl got a live chicken from the
 storeroom off the kitchen and you bled it over
 lew polios throat and body am i right
 maxe shrank away from the razor
 y-yeah

   snips looked triumphantly at garvey is
 that enough he asked

   garvey stepped forward thats plenty
dead men dont bleep

lie said and i recognize this bird now hes
wanted in a couple of states

  maxe jerked cursed snips banged the
mans head on the floor said but somebody
spotted carl when he stole the chicken or any-
how the guy he gave it to was caught carl
took the chicken back downstairs in a pillow
slip so as not to get blood on himself he had
to get rid of the chicken and didnt want it
found around the kitchen theres always
guys hanging around the kitchen for handouts
and stuff and carl just handed the chicken to
one of them but the guy was caught beating
it and carl knew the guy could identify him
he hurried up to frazers suite to ask what
to do thats where i got him

  you see some of the feathers pulled out
of the chicken when they were bleeding it over
lews body and in order to cover them up as
well as get the pillow slip to take the bloody
chicken away in they busted a pillow and
threw the feathers all over i noticed that
some of the feathers were different than the
others these soft pillows are filled with either
duck or goose feathers-not chicken feathers
snips told garvey maxe is the one who
killed lew polio you heard him admit it
but frazer is the one who pushed carl pence
out of the window as soon as frazer heard
that mrs burnard had reported a disturbance
outside her door he got in touch with maxe
found out what had happened and they worked
together from then on i guess thats enough
to make it stick huh

  garvey yanked on his handcuffs its
plenty kid

  you take the credit snips said

  garveys leathery face brightened well
thats swell of you kid but you rate some-
thing out of it too

  i got something snips said and looked
at tillie proudly they ought to make me
shop manager too
