e we were pumping to keep afloat -when we passed into
the windless vortex of the storm where the waves were leap-
ing and jumping crazily and where they crashed in our com-
panion ways and filled the ship beyond hope of saving her

                the five of us and the cat scrambled aloft for
                our lives our deck-load of lumber kept us
                afloat and without fresh water and with al-
                most no food we-lived lashed to the rigging
                for three endless days and nights

                   loncc a steamer hove in sight-but fail-
               ing to see our distress signals went her way
               at  am on the fourth morning steamer
               lights showed momentarily over the wild
               sea we rigged a huge ball of sails and blan-
               kets soaked it with gasoline touched it off
               and hoisted it aloft

o	but the steamer did not change her course she thought we were
fishing the wind blew burning fragments back on the ship setting
her afire in various places i could see the stern light of the steamer
going away from us j i couldnt stop her tve were all dead meal i
climbed to the fore-top and in desperation pulled my flashlight
from my back pocket and in morse code signalled sinking
soshelp

     slowly i saw the ship turn in her last hour afloat all of us and the cat were
saved from the sinking burning pioneer by those fine seamen of the united states
liner american banker and by the power of two tiny eveready frcsb dated bat-
teries that stood by us in the blackcst hour of our lives

as the problems became complex-soon youd master
them all

lasalle problem method

  you cover accountancy from the basic elements
right up to accountancy systems later you choose
from twelve post-graduate electives including c p a
coaching

  as you go along you absorb the principles of audit-
ing cost accounting business law organization
management and finance

  your progress is as speedy as you care to mike it-
depending on your own eagerness to learn and the time
you spend in study

  will recognition come  the only answer as you know
is that success does come to the man who is really
trained its possible you- employers will notice your
improvement in a very few weeks or months indeed

management are the executives of the future

why science fiction

 a guest editorial

 by john taine

  famous scientirction novelist

a magazine devoted to science fic-
tion may seem a strange place to be

serious about science and its urgent
social significance yet juet because fiction
does appeal to a wider audience than do the
technical writings of orofessional scientists
a science fiction magazine is a proper place
to be serious for a moment
about science for even the
wildest story contains at least
one grain of fact and this fact
may remain in the readers
consciousness almost un-
known to himself long after
the plgt of die story and all its
characters are forgotten

  in short the beneficial me-
dicine in the pih may continue
doing its work when the sweet
taste of the sugar coating has
evaporated many readers who
would shy away from a formal
textbook on science may be
induced through scientific fic-
tion to tolerate science in their	lhn
daily lives

  when we tolerate anything we put up
with it or are at least not actively hostile
to it or bear it as when we grin and bear
something or just gjijn intolerance neither
grinning nor bearing is usually founded in
ignorance when the ignorance is lightened
with a little understanding people stop
gnashing their teeth over imaginary evils
and may even begin to smile tolerantly it
is very necessary for the preservation of
civilized society at this moment that the
public he brought to a sane tolerance of
science science furthers the good not the
evil of society

  present readers of science fiction are al-
  friencfly to science their part in

breaking down prejudice against science
is sitaffle they can get some of their

 friends to read scientific stories for the sake
 of the story alone if this is to be done the
 stories must be written attractively enough
 for scientific outsiders to be interested in the
 stories as fiction to take a famous example
 l stevensons dr jekyil and mr hyde
 been read by thousands who never sus-
 pected that the slory is scien-
 tific fiction yet that is exactly
 what it is if a writer of stev-
 ensons caliber found it not be-
 neath his dignity to write sci-
 entific fiction surely some of
 our present fiction writers need
 not be afraid of letting them-
 selves or their guild down by
 following his eieample

   to sane men it is obvious
 that science has improved our
 living conditions far beyond
 whaj the most optimistic
 prophet of a hundred years ago
 would have thought possible
 unfortunately however entire
  anc	nations are being led by men

              who fear and hate science be-
 cause it contradicts their wishful fancies in
 order to govern despotically one must sup-
 press impartial science and it is being
 suppressed in some european countries to-
 day with a ferocity unequaled since the
 darkest iiddle ages

   in central europe alone over  pro-
 fessional scientists have been expelled from
 their fathedands or herded into concentra-
 tion camps we certainly do not wish the
 tike to happen here

   the public must realize for its own good
 that science is well worth getting ac-
 quainted with

   writers of scientific fiction need not
preach or even teaoh deliberately if they
tell a ood story well they will have done
their bit

saturns satellite

the space ship tycho of the
planetary survey bureau came
down bouncingly on its retract-
able landing wheels of thick spongy
neo-rubber that even the cold of space
could not harden a blast of the re-
tarding rockets prevented it from
rolling too far over jagged crystalline
rocks strewn along the narrow valley
between two cliffs picked as the most
promising landing field

  pilot mark traft cursed there
hadnt been much choice in the mat-
ter what with the whole blasted sat-
ellite as torn up in appearance as a
battlefield it had almost been a mat-
ter of closing your eyes and lowering
away with your fingers crossed hop-
ing for the best yet he hadnt done
that he had applied all of his skill
as a class-a pilot the ship came to
rest safely


staktlnu st okies

  unhooking the broad seat-straps he
came to his feet and rose to his full
height of six-feet-five he was pro-
portionately as broad-shouldered
with great hands and powerful arms
muscles bulged beneath his natty uni-
form

  blond-haired he was a reincarnated
viking in all aspects save one-his
face that incongruously had been
stamped by nature in a kindly good-
natured mold and his complexion
was as smoothly fair as a girls much
to his secret disgust nor had he ever
been able to raise a camouflaging mus-
tache or when he left off shaving for
a time more than a scraggly reddish
beard

  he pressed his face against a flaw-
less port plate of artificial diamond
looking out

  this was iapetus eighth moon of
saturn revolving at a distance of -
 miles from its ringed primary
a bitter isolated little world it obvi-
ously was whose dawn was lit only
by the feeble rays of a sun nine hun-
dred million miles away

  its atmosphere he knew was thin
frigid its gloomy surface as much
as he could see of it was a jumbled
scaly waste of barren mineral plains
and some few agelessly frozen lakes
it was a desolate scene one to chill
the eye and heart of a living observer

vet earthmen were about to carry
their interplanetary exploits to
this wayward member of the solar
system in the year  ad a hun-
dred years after the advent of space
travel there was a thriving colony on
titan largest moon of saturn two
million miles away and a fueling out-
post on rhea exploring ships had
already touched on iapetus and noted
its rich beds of beryllium ore

  pretty deserted-looking place
commented greeley the co-pilot also
unstrapping himself he stood six
feet but was dwarfed by the gigantic
traft he went on his eyes rather
bleak not much of the disease of
life as the poets put it here not
even insects

  theres some plant life-looks like
moss commented traft evolution

barely got a start here

  back of them the rest of the ships
list of ten men were making similar
observations somehow the less of
life a world displayed the more inhos-
pitable it appeared even a hotbed of
horrible monsters would have been
preferable to this stony barren
stretch

  however well go out armed said
captain harvey commander of the
expedition

  as a wise and experienced leader
in the survey service he knew that
on alien worlds unknown dangers oft-
entimes lurked just beyond ones nose

 men-he addressed the whole
group-you know what were here
for survey of mineral deposits all
previous expeditions in the past few
years reported extensive beryllium
ores that makes this satellite a sort
of treasure-chest

  he waved his arms as though indi-
cating mountainous heaps of wealth
true in a sense for beryllium form-
ing the lightest and strongest of al-
loys had become the most useful metal
in that age of interplanetary travel

 the mineral exploitation bu-
reau he went on would have come
around to it sooner except that this
satellite is so damnably far out of the
way as it stands saturn is the prac-
tical outpost of present-day earthly
traffic in the solar system and iap-
etus here being so remote from the
primary is about the farthest frontier
so far achieved but now that titan
and rhea have good fueling stations
and docks for ore freighters iapetus
is ripe for the plucking man is
bringing another world to his door-
step

he glanced around knowing that
all the men felt the inner glow
that comes to the explorer who real-
izes he is the first of a cavalcade of set-
tlers workers and builders who will
come later on

  for the survey work the captain
went on you are all under the orders
of hugh benning our mineralogist
and now well get into vac-suits and
venture out all except traft and
greeley you two will remain within
ihk	wuklu

the ship as guard

  the rest of the men struggled into
their vac-suits of neo-rubber the two
pilots helped them clamp the neck fit-
tings of their helmets and clipped ox-
ygen bottles to their belts

  by the way captain harvey
hugh benning said this atmosphere
has always been reported breathable
by other expeditions cold and thin
of course but fresh and pleasant no
harmful effects after an hour

  i know the captain nodded
well try it later but only after a
volunteer has breathed it for fifteen
minutes before the rest do get that
men keep your helmets closed until
i give the word

  finally the eight vac-suited figures
clumped out with their lead-weighted
shoes and the air-lock hissed shut be-
hind them traft and greeley watched
half enviously as their companions
wandered about outside enjoying the
feeling of freedom after the cramped
quarters of the cabin that was al-
ways a thrill to space voyagers

  a few minutes later benning evi-
dently having volunteered to try the
air was seen to unfasten the slit cov-
ering that allowed the outside air to
reach his lungs his suit promptly
deflated as the outside pressure was
greatly lower he turned off his oxy-
gen bottle subsisting entirely by the
satellites atmosphere a normal man
avoiding exertion could breathe such
stratosphere-thin air for a limited
period of time without ill effects

  bet that air has a bite to it traft
shivered glancing at the thermo-scale
that showed the outside temperature
at minus  degrees the overhead
midget sun did little to dispel such
cold but of course he has the nose
tube warming coils taking most of the
chill out

  lucky guy sighed greeley
bottled air always tastes so stale
after a few hours

  a click sounded in the stillness of
the ship traft was training a small
compact camera-a marvel of perfec-
tion that took colored pictures under
almost any conditions - out of the
port snapping the outside scenery
a candid camera fiend if there ever

was one greeley said grinning the
breed hasnt died out in a hundred
years

  its a great hobby said traft sim-
ply i have pictures taken on ten
worlds and im proud of the collec-
tion

  the group outside strode to the top
of a low hillock overlooking the sur-
rounding territory benning kneeled
suddenly grabbing up handsful of
coarse soil to peer at it closely he
seemed startled and was evidently tell-
ing the others what a fortune in ore
lay at hand

  its a wonder private interests
havent been here traft reflected
aloud to sneak away a few million
dollars worth as they did on callisto
remember that case some years ago
they got away with a fortune in ra-
dium ore before government exploita-
tion moved in

  captain harveys deep voice issued
startlingly from the radio speaker
kept open and tuned to his helmet ra-
dio

fwbtraft called the captain we
jl are making our way to the near-
est cliff at the right benning sug-
gests the richest deposits may be
there we are all breathing the air
now very sweet and fresh keep
the radio open

  aye sir said traft

  then he and greeley from the aft
port watched the party move toward
the sharp upflung cliff to the right
from the ships nose they could
make out the cliffs details easily no
more than a quarter-mile away at
the base of it showed the black un-
even cut-out of a natural cave leading
into the solid rock anemic sunlight
failed to penetrate within its depths

  the exploring party had seen the
cave too they were approaching it
with the curiosity that all men have
for the mysterious guns up in in-
stinctive wariness they clambered to
its mouth and peered in benning
climbed to a flat overhanging lip for
a closer look

  to the two watching pilots there
was no thought of danger a deserted
world uninhabited by inimical life-
ai rtki ivllnvj sukes

rodney shelton

forms could offer little uncertainty
their stay on iapetus promised to be
as routine and safe as on the more
well known planets

  and then it came

  they saw the men out there stagger
drunkenly then start to stumble
toward the ship fumbling at their
open visors their movements were
stiff awkward

 somethings happened gasped
greeley in startled alarm

  traft moving with tigerish swift-
ness for all of his size was already
at the radio shouting inpo it

 captain harvey whats wrong
what-

 something - freezing - choking
us came back the captains hoarse
tones and more weakly gas-cold
-in the air traft greeley-help

  the voice died away in a strangling
moan the men were dropping now
one after another bouncing like rub-
ber balls in the light gravity- they
twisted convulsively traft and gree-
ley glanced at one another for an in-
stant of horrified wonder

  vac-suits roared traft whirling
to the rear supply compartment

  they fairly dived into their vac-
suits snapped the oxygen valves and
entered the lock they plunged from

it a moment later and bounded for the
fallen men exerting full muscular
effort in the reduced gravity they
were able to cover the quarter-mile in
less than a minute the fallen men
were lying still now with eyes closed
behind their visors

  traft knelt at the side of captain
harvey and quickly unstrapped his
leaden shoe weights he did the same
for another then picked up the limp
bodies one under each arm he was
still able to run faster than he could
have on earth carrying nothing but
his own weight greeley followed with
two more of the stricken men

  they made another hurried trip but
greeley came back with only one man
inside the cabin he hastily unfastened
his visor benning is missing he
shouted at traft he must have
fallen into the cave mouth

  traft nodded grimly grabbed up a
hand flash and dashed outagain gree-
ley wriggled out of his vac-suit and
began stripping the others

traft returned in a few minutes
his face strained benning is
lost he announced with a note of
finality that cave is a monstrous
place full of pits that havent any vis-
ible bottom he shrugged not with
indifference but with hopelessness

  good lord groaned the co-pilot
b ut he was staring numbly at the bod-
ies of the rescued men they arent
even breathing theyre d- he
gulped unable to bring the word out

  not necessarily snapped traft
though his eyes held the daze of shock
they were exposed only a short time
to whatever was in the air people
dont die so suddenly even when their
hearts stop beating and their lungs
collapse they found that out back
in the twentieth century weve got
to hurry though slip an oxygen mask
over their faces and pump their dia-
phragms like you would for a drowned
person come on weve got work to
do

  they labored like slaves at this
changing from one limp form to an-
other hoping to revive them all but
no signs of returning life rewarded
them no color came to the faces that
the impossible world



seemed drained of all blood the
clammy fingers of fear gripped their
hearts

  gradually the hopelessness of it
stole into their minds but they dog-
gedly continued their efforts unwill-
ing to admit defeat several hours
later dog-weary and with aching mus-
cles they stared at one another pant-
ingly

  theyre dead greeley declared
shudderingly his voice held a grat-
ing edge from frayed nerves

  traft looked haggard but his eyes
were puzzled he raised the arm of
one of the limp forms then he re-
leased it the arm dropped back
loosely

  no rigor mortis he whispered
hoarsely

  what do you mean gasped gree-
ley

  the giant pilot sprang up this
is a case for the extra-terra bio-in-
stitute sudden resolve flared in his
eyes the sooner we get there the
better well refuel at titan and head
for earth

  what good will that do moaned
greeley itll take at least four or
five days to get there by that time
theyll be dead for sure if they arent
already

  maybe they arent-and wont be

  traft stared down at the bodies
queerly trying to tell himself he was
mad for the thought yet his pulses
hammered with an insistent hope that
he might be right he leaped for the
pilot seat

  as iapetus receded from their thun-
dering rockets traft set a course for
the tiny disc of titan near the sweep-
ing curve of saturns rings he found
it easier to stare out at the star-pep-
pered firmament than back at the seven
still figures strapped in their bunks
and the thought of benning lying
broken at the bottom of some measure-
less pit-

  the big pilot had not led a particu-
larly tranquil life in his adventurous
calling but this disastrous episode
numbed him to the core especially
the mystery of it what strange gas
had suddenly appeared in iapetus at-
mosphere did it spell some strange

the space siicniisi

menace natural or-otherwise

  traft shuddered a little somehow
it struck him as full of sinister prom-
ise this amazing event

chapter ii
the institute of bio-magic

from the highest tower of etbi
situated on long island the view
was magnificent far to the west could
be seen the spires of manhattan
earths largest and busiest city the
beating heart of mans empire in the
skies closer on long island itself
lay tellus space port with its gigan-
tic drome and hangars and its wide-
spread landing field

   great liners and freighters rocketed
up and thundered down constantly
the bull roars of their powerful en-
gines could be heard as a steady low
undertone like the beating of an end-
less surf

  the crossroads of space meet
theremurmured dr rodney shelton
to his laboratory assistant myra ben-
ning she nodded

  it was a scene to inspire that
thought as the docks and quays of old


startling stories

london a century before had been
the crossroads of the high seas ah
the rich and varied commerce of other
worlds centered at this hub of the so-
lar empire not a day passed but what
new treasure came out of the void-
precious and useful metals priceless
jewels exotic fopd staffs rare or un-
known to earth this besides the
steady dealing m venusian grains and
meats and the martian manufactures

  at times the breath of adventure
wafted from the spaceways-tales of
hidden lands on alien worlds fabulous
creatures and heroic deeds in that
sense it was like the venice of the
middle ages with its early teachings
into cathay and india and the myste-
rious south seas only here it was
the traversing of etheric trails to mars
and ganymede and rhea

  and there was a frontier-saturn-
beyond which organized enterprise
had not yet advanced it was a mix-
ture of the prosaic and romantic as
with alf such pioneering periods and
no one could say what the morrow
might bring

  the two watchers from the tower
drank in the scene finding a moment
of relaxation from their intense lab-
oratory routine below

 dr rodney shelton was under
thirty and over six feet as lithely
built as an athlete one noticed his
strong chin firm lips and straight
nose but mostly his eyes they were
the steady calm gray eyes of the
dreamer and thinker but in their
depths lurked a certain quality keenly
alive that marked him a man of action
when the occasion demanded

  he did not look outwardly the sci-
entist he was but the wrinkles of
concentration could appear in as in-
stant on his forehead when the brain
behind it delved into a knotty prob-
lem

 beside him myra benning was
wholly feminine despite her shapeless
laboratory smock and the lack of cos-
metic artifices she had the natural
beauty equipment of pert nose gold-
sheen hair and soft blue eyes but
more than that she had a mind and a

corresponding ambition to utilize it

she had chosen science as a career

  suddenly both looked up startled
as the shrill blast of sirens sounded
from the direction of tellus space
port the irens were seldom ased
it meant an emergency of some kind
sometimes crippled ships for in-
stance needed the port cleared for a
dangerous landing

  dr shelton and myra could see
ships hastily wheeling away postpon-
ing take-off one small freighter
about to settle for a landing nosed
up again with a revved blast of its
under tubes to circle and await its
time

a few minutes later the cause of
the disturbance appeared - a
long torpedo-shaped craft that
dropped almost precipitately from the
clouds steam hissed from a hull that
had been heated by rapid descent
through earths air envelope the un-
der tubes flamed a cherry red smooth-
ing the fall but the ship landed bounc-
ingly on its undercarriage and rolled
forward a hundred yards before re-
tarding blasts halted it then the vol-
canic throb of its engines ceased
abruptly

  the air-lock of the landed craft
jerked open hurrying officials from
the drome met the flyers coming out
excitement pulsed in the air to
rodney shelton and his companion it
was like a play being enacted on a
faraway stage the figures were tiny
toys

  wonder what thats all about
mused the man theyve come from
somewhere in a big hurry he leaned
forward straining bis eyes looks
like an exploration ship by the size
of its fuel hold cant make out the
name

  exploration ship myra benning
caught her breath my brother hugh
is with the tycho- she shook her
head but that isnt due back for
three weeks yet it wouldnt be hughs
ship

  she glanced at her wristwatch
weve been up here a half hour she
stated crisply ni think wed better
go down now dr shelton

  youre like the voice of my con-
science the man grinned but youre
the impossible world



right-back to work

  they left the tower to descend to
their laboratory

 the builders of the new york
worlds fair of  had called it the
world of tomorrow they would
have been utterly amazed however to
see what reared on those same grounds
a century later

  to the eye it was simply a group
of giant windowless buildings the
conditioning chambers of etbi-ex-
tra-terra bio-institute but within
them in sealed cubicles were a hun-
dred varieties of temperature press-
ure lighting and the other strange
conditions of extra-terrestrial envir-
onments it was a large-scale biologi-
cal project that had meant much in
earths colonization of the planets

  one building was devoted solely to
martian conditioning men and
women emerged from there with bod-
ies whose metabolism was suited per-
fectly to martian environment with
its utterly dry wispy air freezing cli-
mate and light gravity they were
taken to mars in specially conditioned
space ships a steady stream of them

  mars had been the first to be colo-
nized already the resident popula-
tion of earth people on the red planet
was over five million a dozen indus-
tries thrived there beautiful ceram-
ics from martian clay were much in
demand on earth and the exquisitely
fine cloths from martian spider webs

  another building conditioned colo-
nists to withstand the torrid dampness
of venus ten times as trying to hu-
mans as the hottest jungles of africa
or south america these people
reaped tremendous harvests of the
cloudy planets boundless fertility
crops ripened in a short month in the
hot steamy plains that stretched end-
lessly under veiled skies imported
grains from earth grew in riotous
abundance more than half of earths
staple food supplies came from the
rich farms of venus

all this would have been impos-
sible to normal unconditioned
earth people they would have had
to labor in sealed suits against adverse
environment with all the insurmount-

hark trail

 able handicaps of such methods but
 with people whose metabolism had
 been altered to fit the new conditions
 they lived and breathed as freely as
 though born on those planets

   but how had human metabolism the
 stabilized result of millions of years
 of evolution on earth been changed
 in the final analysis it all centered
 about the use of one remarkable prod-
 uct of biological science developed
 twenty-five years before

   it was called for the press and pub-
 lic just adaptene but only the most
 trusted officials of the institute knew
 what it was by formula by its very
 nature it had to be shrouded in se-
 crecy and kept from the hands of un-
 scrupulous individuals the earth
 union government controlled exclu-
 sively the manufacture and use of
 adaptene

   adaptene was the parent substance
 of all hormones in the living body it
 controlled all metabolism and there-
 fore all the body processes to the last
 one

   most remarkable of the applications
 of this near-miraculous substance had
 been the conquest of jupiters inimi-
 cal environment it had seemed im-
 possible at first at jupiters surface
 was a crushing gravity almost three
stak-xnu stokls

times that of earth that made human
bones and muscles crack in a few
hours

  a moisture-choked heat from the
titanic layers of pressing gases prom-
ised constantly parched throats and
slowly boiling skin worst of all the
atmosphere itself was laden with
gases besides oxygen never meant
for earthly lungs-methane ammonia
and even traces of searing bromine
that exuded from volcanic sources and
gave the whole atmosphere its brown-
ish tinge

  the natural life-forms of jupiters
wild environment were adapted by
milliops of years of evolution how
could earthmen nurtured in a gentler
climate meet that terrible challenge

  it was tried a series of condition-
ing rooms had been prepared with
successively greater air pressure heat
and foreign gases in a way it was
like the twentieth century compres-
sion chambers which had been used to
prepare divers for the great pressures
under the sea three earthmen given
strong doses of adaptene had gone
from chamber to chamber leaden
suits were prepared for them and
weight added day by day their me-
tabolism had faithfully undergone the
necessary changes

  at the end of three months tljey
had reached the final conditioning
room which practically duplicated
jupiters conditions their skins had
become tough and heat-resisting
their lungs filtered out methane am-
monia and bromine automatically re-
taining only the necessary oxygen
their muscles motivated by superac-
tive adrenalin easily supported five
hundred pounds of weight without tir-
ing all this through the magic touch
of adaptene working in its mysterious
way throughout every cell and vein

  the men had been sent to jupiter
one of them succumbed to the contin-
ued harshness of life there but the
other two survived with this proof
of success other men were bio-condi-
tioned and soon a settlement was
founded and work begun to extract
the chemical riches of jupiters soil

  now in  ad bio-conditioned
earthmen were to be found on ten dif-

ferent worlds of the solar system-
mercury venus mars jupiter io
europa ganymede callisto saturn
and titan adaptene had burst the
former bonds of the narrow range of
conditions under which the human
body could survive

  it did not matter whether the at-
mosphere was thin or thick whether
life-supportipg oxygen was scarce or
overabundant whether frigid cold or
suffocating heat existed whether the
force of gravity was weak or bruis-
ingly powerful-adaptene made meta-
bolic corrections for all variations

  they were still humans these made-
over colonists on other worlds sci-
ence had changed their bodies some-
what but not their minds they lived
and loved and worked in alien sur-
roundings with as much of the meas-
ure of well being and happiness as
came to earth-living humans their
children were easily bio-conditioned
from birth onward by adaptene it was
only the start but colonization was
rapidly gaining momentum toward
a great empire in which earth people
lived on all the worlds of the solar
system-by the virtue of adaptene

  etbi where the bio-conditioning
was carried on was a separate branch
of the earth union government along
with the space navy interplanetary
exploration and planetary survey
bureaus the exploitation of space
was a highly organized process

  first the ships of the exploration
service mapped and explored on any
new world then the planetary sur-
vey experts tabulated all raw re-
sources mineral and otherwise the
space navy stepped in next to estab-
lish outposts and fueling stations

  finally etbi sent its tailored per-
manent colonists to dig in and develop
the planet and a new world had been
added to mans growing roster

chapter iii

mystery from the spaceways

the heart of extra-terra bio-in-
stitute was its controlling labora-
the impossible world



tory system whose activities ran the
entire scale of science its staff num-
bered thousands its facilities were
ultra-modern it was the clearing
house of all data brought back from
the spaceways on file was every con-
ceivable bit of information relating to
extra-terrestrial matters

  the head of etbi was a cabinet
member of the earth union govern-
ment second in command was dr
rodney shelton youngest and most
brilliant of the scientific staff

  his career had been studded with vi-
tal researches even before coming to
etbi his graduation thesis as a stu-
dent had settled once and for all the
virus-enigma unsolved for a century
he proved that the viruses were mole-
cular life-forms the link between min-
eral and living states thus tagged
all virus diseases were curable includ-
ing the common cold by treating
them with artificial anti-virus mole-
cules as though they were simply
chemical reagents

   but joining the staff of etbi shel-
ton had turned his attention to the
mysteries of extra-terrestrial biology
he had been with the famed venus
swampland expedition commissioned
to study the terrible brain-softening
plague that periodically swept out from
the swamplands to wipe out whole
communities of earth settlers

   isolating the germ shelton had stud-
ied it at great risk alone-at his own
insistence he passed out his notes
from a sealed-off cubicle of the ship
he lived in a sealed suit and did not
dare eat or drink in a week he came
out thin and weak but happy-with
the answer

  the brain-softening bacteria died
promptly in blue light unknown on
venus because of its cloud-packed
skies that filtered out all blue radia-
tion thereafter all earth settlements
were simply protected when the
plague reared by rings of blue search-
lights

  on mercury shelton had found a
much simpler way of stopping the vor-
acious hordes of omnivorous two-foot
amoeboids than by blasting them to
pieces with small cannon no poison
could affect hem small gelatin cap-

myra benning

 sules containing solid carbon dioxide
 were strewn in their stampeding path
 the giant single-celled monsters ab
 sorbed them dissolved off the gelatin
 and swiftly puffed up into porous bal-
 loons by the action of released gas in
 this form they were whisked into the
 sky by the stiff winds like bubbles
 and eventually dashed to smears
 against rocks and cliffs

   but on mars shelton had met and
 conquered the most baffling problem
 of them all what could one do
 against invisible swarms of spongy
 germs that roamed the wastes of that
 planet and soaked up every last par-
 ticle of water to convert it into more
 spongy germs the least exposure of
 a water supply would let them in to
 fill it with their multiplying legions

   shelton impregnated the normal wa-
 ter with one per cent of heavy-water
 easily manufactured on earth from
 deuterium heavy isotopic hydrogen
 and oxygen by mendehan principles
 applicable to all life whether on earth
 mars or andromeda the hundredth or
 so generation of the sponge-germs
 were unable to breed

   shelton remembered that back in the
 s the law had been laid down that
 heavy water inhibited reproductive
 processes the sponge germ ceased to


startling stories

peril the water supplies of earth col-
onists

but in the past three years shel-
tons responsibilities had been
shifted entirely to the most important
of etbis activities-the bio-condi-
tioning he was one of the trusted few
who knew the chemical formula of
adaptene and was always in complete
charge of every new bio-conditioning
venture engaged in by etbi

  before his transfer to that project
bio-conditioning had been clumsy tak-
ing months sheltons researches en-
abled the process to be cut down to
weeks he had thereby tripled the col-
onization rate of the other bodies of the
system   

  well the conditioning of men for
rhea is about done said shelton in
relief he and his assistant were in
their laboratory after having seen the
excitement of an emergency landing at
the port another score for etbi
and for adaptene its laboratory evo-
lution in a way

  yes dr shelton

  myra benning slipped microscope
slides into a cleansing bath of alcohol
surreptitiously however she was
watching his face it was an interest-
ing face to watch with its glow of in-
spired feelings it was the face of a
leader and organizer one whose mark
would be left in the history of mans
conquest of space but to myra ben-
ning it was also just the face of-a
man

  lets see-shelton was counting
on his fingers-thats the eleventh
world outside of earth to which etbi
has sent its graduates iapetus will be
next to make it an even dozen that
will be soon now his eyes glowed
as one who envisions ever greater hori-
zons exploring and mineral survey
have gone on for several years
theyll want bio-conditioned men
soon when the navy has established
an outpost its like clockwork i
world after world

  the opti-phone bell rang

  shelton snapped the on stud the
bewhiskered jowled face of grant
beatty director of etbi flashed on
the milky screen one of the six men

who under the earth unions presi-
dent ruled the spaceways his force-
ful personality reflected from a ha-
bitually grave face iron-gray hair
framed his piercing eyes and thin firm
lips but his expression was more than
just grave at the moment it was tense

  shelton he barked out of the
speaker drop whatever youre doing
something vital has just come up
weve got an assignment that sounds
more important than anything weve
tackled before the space ship tycho
just docked emergency landing
the exploration ship queried
shelton glancing at his assistant to see
her head swing up sharply the one
that went to saturn for an official sur-
vey of iapetus ore

  thats it corroborated the direc-
tor he went on slowly biting off the
words incisively  its back with only
two men alive out of ten

  mjftra bennings hand went to her
throat but she said nothing shelton
had to admire the way she waited
calmly for the rest though her own
brother might be one of the victims

  shelton was shaking his head it
always hurt to hear of brave men meet-
ing doom out in the spaceways-young
spirited men who had much to live for
some of them were important too sci-
entists technicians now they were
martyrs to mankinds steady march
toward complete dominion of the solar
system

wo alive and the rest dead
shelton muttered on iapetu
-the next colony world on our list
what happened up there on iapetus
he shrank from asking which men
were dead with myra bennings hor-
rified eyes on him

  no not dead boomed director
beatty going back to the first thing
shelton had said

  shelton stared but you just said
that there were only two alive-
yes but the others are not dead
beatty insisted i had a look at the
bodies they arent alive they arent
dead his eyes looked shocked as
though he had seen the incredible
and thats our job shelton finding
out what it means come to the hos-
the impossible world



pital ward at once the bodies have
been brought here

  ill be over in a moment shelton
switched off the phone steady now
he said to the girl

  he slipped off his stained smock and
wrestled into his coat as he stepped
to the door he found her waiting to go
along

  youd better stay he admonished
gently

  i must go she insisted nervously
no matter what it means if hughs
one of them i must see him

  shelton nodded they stepped out
into the hall and wound their way
through the busy corridors arriving at
their destination a few minutes later
the hospital ward in which ailing men
from the bio-conditioning process were
looked after was spacious and modem
second to none on earth

  director beatty greeted shelton a
scowl of worry on his face a physi-
cian with a stethoscope and puzzled
eyes was going over the bodies lying
in a row of beds one of the two men
who had come back alive from iapetus
stood at one side haggard from days
of sleepless driving across space but
his eyes lighted up suddenly

 rod rodney shelton he ex-
claimed striding forward eagerly my
old roommate at edison college re-
member me

  shelton stared at the gigantic young
man blankly for a moment

  mark traft he cried in recog-
nition a broad grin spreading over his
face

  pilot mark traft informed the
tall man in the planetary survey i
went to the training docks when we
graduated i remember you went back
for research id heard you were here
at etbi but never had the chance to
drop in youre a sight for sore eyes
rod

  they stared at each other for a mo-
ment their minds crowding with re-
newed memories of college days

  good to see you again mark
shelton remarked but well talk
later right now-

  he turned to watch myra bennihg
her eyes had flicked over the seven still
figures she had stood stiffly then

breathing hard now she ran up and
grasped the big pilots arm squeezed
with frantic fingers

  my brother-hugh benning she
cried another man came back alive
was it hugh

  trafts face instantly became sor-
rowful

  no miss benning he said softly
one man was lost on iapetus-

  he shifted his feet awkwardly tried
to go on but the words stuck the
girls eyes dilated her lips trembled
shelton wished the news had been
broken to her less abruptly but it was
too late now

f f wwugh- she choked but sud-

  mm denly she straightened up
shaking herself slightly im all
right she said firmly telj me what
happened up there on iapetus-about
hugh

  as briefly and sympathetically as he
could traft gave the details to shelton
and the girl

  seeing we couldnt revive them our-
selves he concluded we decided to
get the men to etbi as soon as possi-
ble we refueled at titan took on
two men as engine crew and ripped
for earth triple-acceleration all the
way he waved a hand here we
are greeley my co-pilot went to re-
port to our superiors i came here
with the bodies i had a hunch all
along they werent-deadf

  shelton stepped to the nearest bed-
side touched a hand to the forehead of
the still man who lay there

  cold he whispered cold as
death

  the examining physician straight-
ened

  medically he pronounced they
arc dead they dont breathe their
hearts have stopped and their blood
has cooled yet there is no rigor
mortis

  to demonstrate he raised a limp arm
of one of the men and let it fall there
was no stiffness apparent

  well whats your final diagnosis
demanded director beatty impatiently

  death without rigor mortis re-
turned the physician stubbornly that
is academically


startling stories

  the director grunted what would
you call it shelton

  suspended animation shelton re-
plied reluctantly the first clear case
in medical history it means arrested
life processes without decomposition
zero metabolism

  he looked at the bodies as though
still unwilling to believe

  suspended animation muttered
director beatty though he had not
been surprised all right revive
them he ordered the physician get
the whole staff on the job if you have
to

  i dont think ordinary methods arc
going to work said shelton grimly
however let them try

  the ordinary methods did fail they
knew an hour later that such methods
were futile even an injection of ad-
renalin directly into the heart of one
of the men had failed to start the slight-
est flutter of pulse director beatty
became the picture of baffled dismay

  weve got to revive those men he
ground out finally the reputation of
etbi is at stake youre the best
damned biologist on earth today
shelton-he spoke challengingly-
and were up against the best damned
problem thats reared out of the space-
way yet im putting you in complete
charge if it takes a day or a year get
these men up and around

  i think adaptene is the answer
shelton exclaimed and went on rap-
idly to explain in a sense these bod-
ies have -been thrown into an eviron-
ment without air heat or any of the
normal things theyre adapted to
those extreme conditions we can
adapt them right back to ours

  director beatty nodded try it
he said and left other pressing du-
ties claimed his attention

when he had sent the worn-out
ww traft for a rest shelton called
the hospital staff and gave them or-
ders the group galvanized into ac-
tion in a few minutes the seven limp
forms were in combination fever ma-
chines and iron lungs small doses of
the miracle substance adaptene were
injected it remained to be seen
whether it could bring metabolism up

from a zero point as well as simply
shift it in degree

  this must work shelton said
hopefully to myra but itll prob-
ably be a wait of hours

  he saw her red-rimmed eyes and
suggested she take a rest

  no she shook her head and went
on tonelessly theres more work to
do ill help you

  the puzzle of it all cropped to the
fore in sheltons mind just what
caused the suspended animation he
murmured what queer unknown
gas-at least they spoke of eas is it
in the iapetus air i wish i knew but
traft forgot to bring back a sample
in all the excitement his eyes sud-
denly lit with a thought theres one
man who might know-the space sci-
entist 

  he whirled and strode toward the in-
stitutes main opti-phone exchange
room beckoning the girl to follow

  the space scientist she reiter-
ated in astonishment do you know
him-talk to him

  i did once shelton said shortly

       chapter iv
       the space scientist

in the exchange room the half-doz-
ing male operators jerked to atten-
tion at sight of shelton

  call long-distance radio central
shelton ordered rapidly and have
them send out a full-power call for
the space scientist on micro-wave
nine when an answer comes give
me a private line

  yes dr shelton

  the attendant plugged in radio-cen-
tral the most powerful earth radio sta-
tion whose services reached through
the heaviside layer on micro-waves
to every planet of the empire or to
any ship in space

  i only hope he decidcs to answer
shelton muttered

  from what ive heard of the space
scientist myra benning said
 deigns is the word

  rodney shelton grinned mirthlessly


the impossible world	j

it amounts to about that hes the
most mysterious figure living today
no one seems to know just who he is
or how it started but he lives out in
space in a ship elaborately equipped
he has a complete laboratory in it they
say he shook his head wonderingly
hes been in space for twenty years
alone he has never been known to
land on any planet for supplies but he
must have some means of picking up
fuel oxygen and food probably
through confederates

tervals he contacts earth scientists
and asks for certain information to fur-
ther his vfrork on his great theory
whatever it is but if you want to con-
tact him hes liable to ignore your call
hes called me once to ask about a bio-
logical point though how that could
help him i dont know

why are you calling him asked
the girl

a hunch more or less confessed
shelton he has on tap a lot of first-
hand information about the solar sys-

the space rangers guns peppered the black ship chapter vi

  what docs lie do out in space alone
year after year i should think hed go
mad the girl shuddered

  hes a hermit by nature i suppose
shelton explained hes compiling
data for a tremendous new concept of
the universe he does no harm years
ago the space rangers tried to track
him down but never caught him
theyve left him strictly alone since
then his ship with two large white
crosses on it has been sighted every-
where from mercury to saturn at in-

tern he may know something signifi
cant about iapetus

  the operator turned heres your
party dr shelton-the space scien-
tist he looked rather startled at
having contacted this mysterious al-
most mythical character you can
take the call in private booth three
shelton strode to the booth motion-
ing myra benning to follow it was
something to keep her miild off the
thought of her brothers sad fate

  he closed the door behind them in


startling stories

the roomy booth and snapped the
switch the opti-screen came to life
with a subdued hum spectrum colors
flitted across the fluorescent round
plate and finally intertwined into the
head and shoulders of the space scien-
tist

  myra benning caught her breath
the face was hidden the entire head
was enclosed in an opaque globe of
what seemed to be semi-porous cloth
no features were distinguishable be-
hind the mask

  bmje always wears that hood at

  -mm least while televising whis-
pered shelton no one has ever seen
his face he did not realize that
the sensitive instrument in the en-
closed booth was picking up his whis-
per

  and no one shall ever see my face 
came in harsh stiffly accented tones
from the masked image i have made
a vow never to let earth see my face
again twenty years ago on earth in
a laboratory    well no matter a
strange laugh came from behind the
head but you wouldnt want to see
my face it isnt a pretty sight

  shelton glanced at the girl signifi-
cantly this confirmed rumors that
an unfortunate accidcnt in a labora-
tory had seared the space scientistss
face horribly and had embittered him-
it had finally driven him to exile him-
self in space where no one would see
his disfigurement shelton felt pity
for the man

  im sorry he said simply then
went on hurriedly after an awkward
pause ive contacted you sir to ask
for any information you may have
about iapetus

  why do you want to know about
iapetus the space scientist asked
coldly

  seven men have come back from
there in a state of suspended anima-
tion apparently from breathing iape-
tus air shelton explained he went
on to give the details

  the masked scientist seemed to lis-
ten attentively but at the end he said
laxly

  i am not interested in these affairs
i am not interested in any earthly

matters i have divorced myself com-
pletely from that pettiness men are
fools life is futile and meaningless
only mind is important and the con-
templation of the great mysteries of
the cosmos

  the globed head moved forward and
the voice lowered with tension i
am at the verge of a tremendous new
concept of the universe it will em-
brace all things in one master formula 
that has been my dream for twenty
years it will be a significant achieve-
ment it will in one sweeping stroke
give meaning to all things he ended
almost in a shout

  but sir about iapetus- began
shelton

  i dont care about iapetus re-
torted the masked man scornfully i
have no concern with your petty trou-
bles im not a citizen of earth fur-
thermore i am my own master with
all space as my domain his arm
moved as though to snap off the con-
nection

  wait snapped shelton angrily
you may be independent of earthly
ties but youre still a human being
as such you must have some regard
for earthly things

 the space scientists arm drew
back still a human being his
mirthless laugh sounded again well
spoken who are you again

  dr rodney shelton of etbi
ah yes said the hidden lips re-
flectively i recall contacting you
once you answered my questions so
in return if i can help you i suppose
i should but be quick about it
have you had occasion to test the
iapetus air recently shelton quer-
ied

  yes just a minute and ill get my
record the space scientists form
moved aside out of the screens range

sheltons eyes stared wonder-
ingly into what he could see of the
cabin of the space scientists myste-
rious ship his vision went down a
short corridor into a laboratory a
bewildering variety of apparatus was
discernible most of it blurred from
off-focus so that he couldnt guess its
nature yet he could sense the com-
the impossible world



pleteness of equipment and advanced
nature of the mans experiments an-
other of the many unconfirmed rumors
about the space scientist was that he
had discovered amazing new thing-s
that earth scientists would pledge
their souls to know

  myra benning shivered somehow
hes so cold and implacable she whis-
pered he doesnt seem human any
more hes been warped by his long
life ir space to something different
from you and me j

  nonsense shelton laughed
shortly on the contrary he is still
human in nature as well as body more
human than he knows himself he
proved it by yielding to my little
speech

  he broke off as they heard footsteps
approaching the screen the space
scientists masked face appeared

  i had occasion to land on iapetus
in the course of my planetary studies
he said i analyzed its atmosphere
gases present in iapetus atmosphere
are oxygen nitrogen hydrogen car-
bon dioxide helium neon and traces
of the other noble gases if you want
the percentages-

  no declined shelton when did
you make the test

  once ten years ago and also just
a month ago the resalts were the
same both times

  one more question pursued shel-
ton do you think it possible for an
alien gas to be present so unstable
that it cannot be detected
impossible the space scientist
said confidently particularly with
my technique i use a cold-hght spec-
troscope a boastful note crept into
his voice earths scientists dont
know of that method it examines
substances at the low stable tempera-
ture of liquid helium

  shelton stared that was incredible
and he almost said so no one had
ever made spectroscopic tests without
heat but then he remembered to
whom he was talking-a genijis mad
or not who had labored at his space
science for two decades space was
cold perhaps his researches had nat-
urally veered toward low temperature
methods

  i see shelton said thats all i
wanted to ask you sir thanks and
good-by

  he was reaching a hand to switch
off but the space scientists voice in-
terposed what are you going to do
about those seven unfortunate men

  i thought you werent interested in
earthly affairs said shelton sharply
suppressing a smile

  i am though in a purely esoteric
way the masked man returned life
and mens doings are after all a part
of the universe which i am encom-
passing in my theory i cannot en-
tirely ignore that which exists all
mankind will be represented by one
symbol in my formula-the symbol
zero there was almost an ominous
note in his voice perhaps ill ex-
plain that in some future contact
ill look forward to it said shel-
ton as for the seven men adaptene
will revive them i believe he set
his jaw and im going to solve the
mystery of what happened to them if
it takes a year good-by j

he snapped off but not before a
slightly derisive chuckle came
from the space scientist just before
his image faded

  myra benning shivered again now
i can appreciate that expression the
cold scientist she murmured hes
all of that if he can laugh at the pre-
dicament of those men hes a-a beast
too

  but hes human defended shel-
ton notrice how close he was to
earth-must be hovering fairly near
since there was so little delay in the
signafs going back and forth he prob-
ably stays around earth a good deal
eagerly listening to news and vreion
programs eating his heart out because
hes made a silly vow never to come
back ive got him figured out

chapter v
expedition to the unknown

hen they got back to the hos-
pital ward the men were still


startling stories

in their lifeless stupor shelton or-
dered another injection of adaptene

  the night hours fled as he waited
but at dawn the whole tired crew was
electrified to hear a low groan above
the noises of the laboring lung ma-
chines shelton dashed up and peered
down into the glass top of the drum
to see the mans arms and legs twitch-
ing his head was moving from side
to side he was alive

  suddenly his voice was heard faint-
ly through a vibrator gas-cold-
choking-damn them gas-

  agonized moans followed then si-
lence the man-captain harvey-
had fallen into a restful sleep

  take him out ordered shelton
adaptene did it all right the others
will revive soon too his smile of
relief changed into an aching yawn
and then we can all get some sleep

  eight hours later a momentous con-
ference took place in the ward where
the seven men who had met seeming
death on iapetus were recovering
they were fully awake now smoking
cigarettes and apparently unharmed

  tell us just what happened cap-
tain harvey rodney shelton asked
when director beatty arrived

  myra benning and mark traft were
already there the big pilot looking
himself after a nights sleep had
greeted his companions with unre-
served joy at their miraculous return
to life for a week he had seen them
as men dead

  there-isnt much to tell captain
harvey said slowly it struck us like
a lightning bolt we were looking into
the cave couldnt see much then sud-
denly an intense cold feeling came over
us at the same time some odorless
gas choked us at least thats the way
it felt

  he looked around at his men for cor-
roboration and they all nodded their
eyes reflected the shock they had felt

  we tried tc run for the ship cap-
tain harvey resumed but we lost con-
sciousness thats all we knew until
we woke up here a few hours ago he
smiled wryly its hard to believe
that days have passed

  the whole thing is a mystery
grumbled director beatty where

did that gas come from shelton
weve got to know

  shelton faced the group his features
thoughtful ive come to certain con-
clusions already he stated without
preamble the strange gas did not
come from the general atmosphere
ive checked that with the space sci-
entist he gave the facts briefly dis-
regarding their surprise therefore
it may be that the gas came from the
cave formed by volcanic action per-
haps within iapetus puffed out of the
cave as a natural vent

  thats logical mused the direc-
tor

  but shelton suddenly whirled on
captain harvey

  when you were coming out of your
coma captain you said gas-choking
-damn them why those last two
words

the captain started did i he
began lamely then drew a breath
and went on firmly it might have
been my imagination but i thought i
saw figures lurking in the caves shad-
ow none of the others saw figures
ive asked them i was nearest the
cave mouth calling to benning to step
down from his dangerous perch the
cold struck at that moment and i
thought i saw some forms in the cave
he set his lips grimly

that would mean shelton spoke
incisively that some person or per-
sons in the cave shot that gas out
the assembled men were dumb-
founded at the implications of that

  trafts big fists had involuntarily
doubled it could be private interests
working he half roared maybe they
want the beryllium ore for themselves
and are willing to go any lengths short
of murder if somebody has invented
a gas that produces suspended anima-
tion they had something as useful for
their purpose as a death gas he
ground his teeth in sudden rage
dirty dogs-using a horrible means
like that to hoe the beryllium ore
ridiculous spat out director
beatty glaring at the impulsive pilot
we cant jump to conclusions like
that it must be a natural phenom-
enon private interests wouldnt dare
the impossible world



go to such lengths he directed his
glare at captain harvey with all
due respect captain i think you have
an overactive imagination

  maybe so retorted the bluff cap-
tain easily but my men and i are
going right back up there as soon as
we can and find out  the spirit of
daring shone in his eyes and his men
unhesitantly nodded their willingness

  sheltons eyes suddenly took fire he
faced the director

  i think etbi should send up an ex-
pedition and ill lead t iapetus is
next on our list anyway for field tests
toward bio-conditioning in fact we
can combine expeditions - use the
etbi- thats a big enough ship
for captain harvey and his men and
all their surveying paraphernalia
director beatty thought that over
his bearded face dubious shelton had
led such routine expeditions to ten
other worlds but only after navy out-
posts had been established this was
different hate to risk a valuable man
like you up there shelton-

  risk scoffed the young scientist
theres a navy outpost on rhea
til sanction it agreed the director
finally arising the etbi- can be
outfitted and ready in a week ill have
to snip a little red tape to have the ex-
peditions combined as you suggest
but i think its a good idea

  he had turned to leave when myra

benning touched him on the arm

  im going along she wasnt ask-
ing him she was stating a fact

  w-what the director opened his
mouth to remonstrate but the girl
said

  no one saw my brother die on
iapetus theres a chance hes still
alive-in a state of suspended anima-
tion im going along

  this is-er-highly irregular di-
rector beatty growled but ill ar-
range it he wilted before the girls
fixed determination

shelton stared at her in sur-
prise it had never occurred to
him that she was possessed of so much
will and courage

  a week later the expedition ship had
been fully stocked and fueled its huge
engine tuned and tested for its long
flight dawn was just breaking redly
as captain harvey and his men fully
recovered trooped into the lock

  the hulking form of traft followed
myra benning up the gangplank the
girl was in mannish attire shelton
watched her half in surprise as though
it had suddenly come to his attention
that she was a woman she was ob-
viously that in mans clothing

  no one was there to see the take-off
except director beatty and a drome

had not been informed it had been

si

thought best to keep the whole matter
a secret since the news distorted by
rumor might easily place an unnec-
essary stigma on iapetus future

  this is purely a scientific expedi-
tion not a snooping for trouble di-
rector beatty warned shelton in formal
tones but his voice became more in-
timate as he said good luck lad
he took sheltons hand in a warm
clasp and gave him a friendly clap on
the shoulder

  dont worry about me director i
shelton said cheerfully theres no
danger up there except a mysterious
gas from which we can easily protect
ourselves

  he leaped lightly to the locks thresh-
old and pulled at the heavy portal plate

  if there should happen to be any-
thing-subversive bawled the direc-
tor just before the plate banged shut
call the navy outpost-m

  with a thunderous crescendo of its
drive tubes the great ship etbi-
taxied a thousand yards down the run-
way of tellus space port and then
roared for the clouds as its under tubes
thrust against gravity

  strapped securely in one of the two
seats of the pilots cupola shelton re-
laxed his muscles against the inertia
no use fighting it as earth-lubbers
usually did to ache later beside him
sat brawny mark traft watching the
panel dials with a careful yet casual
eye that spoke of his assured skill

  nice boat he said feelingly
handles like oiled silk

  shelton craned his neck toward the
side port the ground slanted away
tipping at a crazy angle with the sky-
scrapers of mighty manhattan hang-
ing breathlessly from a steep cliff so
it seemed from the interior of the de-
parting ship as the rhythmic thump
of the rockets pushed earth away

  the ship bored its way through
shimmering cloudpacks that seemed
to split asunder as the clear shiny
stratosphere was reached earth was
now a huge cotton-filled bowl back
of them shelton blinked waiting for
the queer optical illusion to change it
did suddenly and the half-earth be-
came a tremendous concave shell
with it came that startling hollow

sensation that the world they had left
was dropping into a bottomless pit
while they hung motionless

  the ship tore through the thinning
darkening stratosphere till the stars
peeped out one by one gradually pep-
pering the whole firmament the sun
to the side blossomed out in unhin-
dered glory halo and corona plainly
visible traft reached over with his
huge paw to adjust the venetian-type
shades cutting off most of its fierce
blinding glare

wmhipped along by its tem-
ww pestuous drive jets the ship
hurtled through the last fringes of
atmosphere into the universal mid-
night of space here the way was clear
and the suddenly muted rocket blasts
revved into its high-power plane pil-
ing on speed cross-hairs over the
chart on the pilotboard followed the
red line of their plotted course

  they were on their way to saturn
nice smooth take-off mark com-
mended shelton admiringly youve
got that real feel for ships you cer-
tainly didnt miss your calling
thanks rod the giant pilot
was plainly happy when sitting at the
controls of a ship his good-natured
face shone sure glad were together
again old boy its like old times

 fate kept us apart too long
agreed shelton and brought us-to-
gether on a pretty strange twist how
long do you estimate the trip
about eight days

  shelton looked surprised i figured
seven myself why the extra day
were taking a high jump over the
asteroid belt following the safest
liner route traft reluctantly added
as he saw sheltons raised eyebrows
orders from director beatty you
see-

 yes i see snapped shelton
valuable life aboard-mine he
scowled heavily i wish theyd stop
treating me like a gold cup why
didnt they send half the navy along
as convoy while they were at it he
kicked disgustedly at the wall as he
made for below

 traft grinned rodney shelton
didnt realize his own importance the
mil hwfuillll vvublu

pilot had heard much from the lips of
director beatty the man being
groomed to take over etbi some day
when beatty was retired could not be
lightly risked to the dangers of space
earths program of oolonial hegemony
was too vital to stand the loss of one
of its key men traft had made secret
promises to stick with shelton every
minute of the day and night

  with his attention less occupied by
the ship the big pilot took down his
camera from its wall clamp and made
the lens adjustment that would give
the best space views pictures of earth
as a receding globe were always
fascinating and always different no
matter how many times he took them

  routine settled over the ship there
was much time for cards chess and
idle talk somehow their destination
wasnt mentioned much except cas-
ually yet there was a tension that
grew hourly

  shelton could understand why to
all except himself the arrival at iape-
tus would be a persona matter to
captain harvey and his men it was
the desire to solve if possible the
mystery of their recent adventure big
traft clenched his fists at times un-
consciously and shelton knew he was
thinking of possible battle if cap-
tain harveys figures turned out to
be real myra bennings eyes showed
she was thinking of her brother-and
hoping

shelton himself felt the surge
of adventures pulse in his veins
stirring his red blood promising ex-
citement in one shape or another
questions buzzed in his mind had
the mysterious gas come from the
cave had it been produced artifi-
cially if so had it been meant to
discourage further survey of beryl-
lium ore and was it non-lethal for
that reason to avoid bringing down
the full wrath of authority

  two days later earth standard
time the etbi- passed over the
asteroid belt myriad new stars twin-
kled out of the backdrop of space
winking as the irregularly shaped lit-
tle bodies rotated in the sunlight had
they passed closer they would have

seen the bright magnesium beacons
lighting the clearest lanes directly
through the gnarled group but they
were far above the zone and soon the
little planetoids faded into the ob-
scurity of space

  after ample warning bells had
clanged through the ship rocket
power was started up again this time
with an off-thrust that would slant
them back from the peak of their flight
to the solar systems level most
ships except those on express sched-
ules adopted this route for the added
safety factor though at the cost of
time distance and fuel

  and now with a direct course set
for far saturn impatience began to
grow on them all iapetus moon of
mystery occupied their thoughts
and more and more the monotonous
routine aboard the unpowered cbast-
ing ship palled there was not much
to do in space but eat sleep and watch
the clock

chapter vi
attack in the void

on the fourth day something hap-
pened to break that routine

  shelton was in the main cabin at the
time dozing in a lounge chair most
of the men were playing cards mur-
muring in low tones myra benning
sat stiffly gazing out into the star-
spattered void

  look the girl cried out abrupt-
ly startled

  what sheltons eyes snapped
open staring at myra as were the
others

out there she pointed out of the
port something black-and huge

  they all scrambled for the port
shading their eyes from the cabin
lights glare peering out there was
something out there black and large
that blotted out the stars in that di-
rection

  a meteor somebody yelled
warn the pilot

its not a meteor snapped shel-
ton its oval-shaped symmetrical
aimkxlinu siuftiwj

and its paralleling our course which
meteors dont do its a ship

  without a light and painted jet-
black breathed another of the men
a pirate ship

  myra benning drew in her breath
sharply there were tales told of
piracy that made the blood run cold

  shelton was already on his way to
the pilots cupola pulling himself up
the companionway by sheer muscular
effort in the gravityless ship he burst
into the room to find captain harvey
staring out anxiously traft was
signaling the engine room to stand by
for emergency

  pirate shelton demanded
might be the captain said nerv-
ously anything can happen out
here beyond the asteroids

  looks mighty suspicious agreed
the big pilot tensely it came up so
suddenly i didnt even see its rocket
blasts

  signal it ordered captain har-
vey they usually make their de-
mands by radio it might be trying to
contact us already

  aye sir traft punched at the
radio stud

  the black shape looming nearer
was evidently angling in so that its
prey could not escape its entire sur-
face was a uniform dull unglazed
black that barely reflected the light of
the distant sun no ports were visible
not a single beam of light relieved the
utter blankness of hull no ship like
that had ever been reported before
shelttfns pulses were throbbing

  ahoy traft bellowed into his
microphone on the all-wave circuit
what hip veer off immediately
or state your purpose

  captain harvey reached over to pull
the handle sounding the alarm below
to strap in for suddenly applied
power if worst came to worst they
must be ready to run for it before the
strange ship if it were a pirate had a
commanding position with its guns

  if they dont veer off we will he
said tightly traft-

  wait interposed shelton lets
not be scared off so easily i dont see
a gun on them

  captain harveys head jerked up

dr shelton he said firmly as
navigation captain i have full com-
mand while in space my flight orders
are to be obeyed without interfer-
ence 

shelton flushed skghtly but
nodded he realized there could
not be two captains during an emer-
gency

  traft continued the capftin try
once more and if they dont answer
we veer off

  the big pilot bawling louder than
before repeated his call no answer
came

  blast them traft growled who
do they think they are not answer-
ing for two plugged martian
nickels id ram them he coughed
suddenly and his voice was thick as
he said jerkily somethings hap-
pened  i feel cold-numb-

  everybody aboard the ship had the
same sensation something gripped
their nerves with an icy clasp as
though they had suddenly plunged
into a frigid pool yet it was only in-
ternally that they felt it the sur-
rounding temperature had not
changed

  shelton gasped what terrible force
was probing into their vitals with con-
gealing fingers

  he had no time to conjecture he
felt his senses swim his legs crum-
pled weakly under him and he knew
that had there been normal gravity
he would have crashed to the floor as
it was he slowly swayed feeling all
the strength go out of hnn a crush-
ing weight seemed to smash into his
chest knocking his breath out fee-
bly he tried to fight off the invisible
incubus he was choking gasping
fighting for breath

 traft-veer- captain harvey
was leaning crazily against the bulk-
head like a sagging stuffed dummy

  trafts eyes wefe popping out as
his lungs strained against a deadly
paralysis with a herculean effort
half growling and half strangling he
raised bands that were numb and
sened non-existent every mhbcie
quivered against an intolerable leth-
argy he punched at the power key-

board with one big paw aad with the
other grabbed the belt around shel-
tons middle

  his numbed lingers bent clumsily
t the knuckles as he touched the
drive-tube studs he pressed thern
over by the sheer smashing impact of
his hand instantaneously the off-
side rockets fumed sulfurously
throwing the ship off its arrowlike
plunge through space

  trafts body jerked against the
straps of his seat shelton would have
catapulted against the wall except for
the big pilots death grip oa his belt
captain harvey merely flattened
against the bulkhead as the line of
motion was away from him

  the strange force gripping them
eased suddenly and traft let out his
breath in a sobbing hiss of relief bufe
only for a moment was there respite
shelton diving for the second pilot
seat barely had time to fling the strap
around him before the terrific numb-
ness again seized him coincident with
their motion the attacking ship had
also swung sideward keeping close

  oh no you dont traft snorted
savagely til show you a thing or
two about maneuvering 

  he applied both hands rapidly going
limp again to the keyboard and their
ship darted ahead the next second it
braked captain harvey came flying
forward with a wild cry shelton was
barely able to stick out a hand and grab
the captains arm pulling him between
his knees he fervently hoped all
those below had heeded the warning
bell and strapped in when traft had be-
gun his game of tag with the enemy

the big pilot sloughed the ship
around madly with volcanic blasts
from all angles in succession they
flew up then down then back thl the
hip creaked throughout its length
but the mysterious blaok marauder fol-
lowed relentlessly duplicating every
maneuver with maddening ease

  the numbing force began to bathe
them with unvarying intensity shel-
ton felt himself sinking into oblivion
with a hopeless feeling yet he saw
that big powerful indomitable traft
had not given up

  putting into play every ounce of his
splendid vitality and strength traft
continued punching desperately at the
keyboard he tried a straightaway
dash at triple acceleration the amaz-
ing craft of stygian gloom followed
crawling up on them as though to show
its superiority expertly it maneuv- 
ered closer than before and the para-
lyzing force grew stronger-stronger

  muscles cracking traft jerked pro-
fane defiance out of his strangling
throat and pounded bis balled fists at
the keys but it was useless his
muscles had turned to water groan-
ing fighting to the last he felt his
spice going limp another few sec-
onds now and hed be helpless like
the others were

  but the terrible internal stricture
ceased suddenly

  amazed trapt jerked his body erect
then be saw why out of nowhere
the vermilion flames of rockets bad ap-
peared and a long sleek ship streaked
up a space ranger ship traft
ripped a hoarse shout of relief from his
raspy throat

  with its bristling guns peppering
shots at the black ship the space
ranger blasted up like a zooming me-
teor the black ship withdrew sul-
lenly it seemed as though debating
whether to outface the formidable
armed newcomer then it plunged
away with the space ranger after it

 whats-up-mark  shelton
asked dazedly raising his head with
a suppressed groan

  whats up chortled traft our
dark friend just slunk back where it
came from with a ranger hot on its
trail you know what that means ten
to one that the black ship will be full
of holes in five minutes and those
aboard lucky enough to get into vac-
suits prisoners

  saved breathed captain harvey

he crawled weakly from between
sheltons knees saved from- he
broke off shuddering his eyes had a
strange wondering gleam in them

  they remained where they were
panting relaxed gaining back
strength that had been sapped danger-
ously near the limit of endurance
they didnt speak for awhile enjoy-
ing to the full the delicious feeling
of being snatched from an unknown
fate

 presently traft snapped on the
broadcast phone plugging in the main
cabin

  everybody all right down there
he called

 myra bannings voice answered
after a moment shakily

  yes all of us were strapped in
but what happened what was that
frightful numbness her tones were
bewildered high-pitched with hyste-
ria then before he could answer
is dr shelton all right

  he looks about like hed just come
out of jupiters red spot traft said
wryly but hes okay we-

he snapped off with a hurried ex-
cuse as the signal light flashed
above his space radio through the
port they could see the space ranger
returning retarding rockets belching
gracefully it maneuvered to parallel
their course the seven-pointed star
insignia of the space rangers polic-
ing corps of the space navy was em-
blazoned in gold over its silvery hull

  the ranger commanders keen-eyed
face appeared slightly baffled in ex-
pression in the opti-screen

 commander gordy space ranger
ship forty-fout-b reporting to dr
rodney shelton etr-i said the
image the black ship escaped sir

  escaped echoed the three men
blankly the space rangers policing
all the spaceways had the best and
fastest ships known

  by a trick shelton asked

  no sir it simply pulled away
from us on the straightaway and it
doesnt seem to use rocket motivation
i can hardly understand it myself
sir the commander looked genu-
inely shame-faced

 of course it was dark and un-
lighted admitted shelton no
fault of yours commander im sure
were only too glad you were here
in time to- he eyed the officer ask-
ance incidentally how did you hap-
pen to be at hand so miraculously

  the man smiled slightly weve
been following you all the way from

earth director beattys orders sir
when we saw your sudden maneuvers
as revealed by your rocket flares we
knew something had happened and
came up we are to convoy you to
iapetus well be right behind you
for the remainder of the trip dr shel-
ton

  very good commander shelton
clicked off and whirled did you hear
that he exploded a convoy-for
me what am i a man or a museum
piece

 if you ask me traft drawled
pointedly its rather lucky for us the
ranger was around he rubbed his
bruised knuckles ruefully about ten
seconds more and- he interrupted
himself but that ship why the
attack what did they use on us
and it didnt use rocket power what
motivated it in the name of jupiter
a space ship cant run without rock-
ets its fantastic

  yet it did shelton quietly inter-
posed it must run by some sort of
gravity control scientists have tried
for years to develop that without suc-
cess but that ship had it we have
to face facts it also had some sort
of ray or field projected across space
from ship to ship that produced the
numbing sensation fantastic again
but somehow they do it

  and shelton captain harveys
voice was vibrant he had come out
of a perplexed daze that numbing
sensation we went through-it was the
same as our experience on iapetus
the same cold feeling choking stran-
gling it wasnt a gas at all as we
thought it was this same-force id
swear it

 shelton was thunderstruck had
they been at the point of being thrown
into suspended animation had it in
fact been this same force instead of
a gas on iapetus something that
could rapidly extract energy from the
nervous system a sort of cold-
beam-exact opposite of a heat-
beam

ffhhat seems to tie it up with the
jl the iapetus affair shelton
ground out finally and that means
your figures in the cave are real af-
wu

ter all captain harvey but just who
are they and whats their purpose

  pirates with a hide-out there
rumbled traft or piratical private
interests who want that beryllium ore
same thing they dont want our
noses in their business simple enough
isnt it he doubled his fists and
his eyes gleamed i think were going
to run into something on iapetus
well theres nothing i like better than
a good fight his good-natured face
twisted into a ferocious grimace

  shelton smiled you may be right
you old warrior good thing beatty
doesnt know of this he laughed
half bitterly hed want me back
right away locked up and guarded by
the navy

  shelton captain harvey said
slowly perhaps it would be best if
we did turn back we dont know
what-

  shelton jerked up his face deter-
mined captain youre navigation
commander but im commander of the
expedition i have signed orders to
land the expedition on iapetus and
thats what were going to do

  captain harvey shrugged and left
for his office

  good boy traft approved
warmly theres nothing like a lit-
tle excitement to make life worth-
while it-

  the flashing of the radio signal in-
terrupted him he snapped on the
opti-screen tuning till lights began
to flicker at micro-wave nine shoul-
ders appeared and a head invisible
behind a masking globe

  the space scientist exclaimed
shelton stepping to the microphone

   yes it is i the image said in cold
tones i am calling to warn you not
to go to iapetus

  shelton and the big pilot looked at
each other in amazement

  why not snapped shelton
because danger awaits you there
it would be best for your own sake to
turn back dr shelton the mysteri-
ous scientists tones were serious al-
most ominous

  but how do you know that de-
manded shelton his eyes narrowed
we were just attacked do you know

of that too

  the space scientist nodded in the
course of my wanderings through
space certain things come to my atten-
tion unavoidably dont ask me any
further questions i am not concerned
with those things one way or the
other i care only for my science my
great theory but i give you this
warning-do not go to iapetus
why are you taking the trouble to
warn me queried shelton curiously

  the queer masked man did not an-
swer for a moment finally he said in
gruff tones

  dont attribute it to maudlin senti-
ment ive renounced such things
earth is a world of fools who let hu-
man emotions run away with them my
motive in this case is simply esoteric
you have a good brain shelton and
you are a scientist science must go
on you would come to harm on iape-
tus that is all i have to say

chapter vii

the secret of the cave

 a bruptly the masked image
faded from the opti-screen
shelton turned with a grin

  by glory the old boy likes me
traft came out of an astonished
trance at having seen the semi-
legendary space scientist though he
had not been too astonished to hastily
snap him several times with his cam-
era

  what about the warning rod
maybe-

  maybe nothing i cried shelton his
jaw set grimly were going to
iapetus you couldnt stop me now
with ten cold-rays im going to solve
their mystery if i have to explore the
whole system to do it

  the great etbi- nosed its way
into the little saturnian universe it
was a welcome sight to the voyagers
after the long btretch through empty
monotonous space in its ringed
beauty saturn looked like a gigantic
rosy apple with a shimmering halo of
perforated gauze around it
uujujju huhlu

  it was the outpost the present fron-
tier of mans empire beyond earth on
misted saturns surface were a few
scattered settlements that gathered the
valuable medicinal herbs that grew
there titans mines were already gain-
ing prestige for their rich tungsten iri-
dium and copper ores

  rhea about to be exploited for its
sulphur and mercury was soon to be
given its first bio-conditioned citizens
through etbi and adaptcne shel-
ton thrilled with pride at the thought

  but beyond in the outer gulfs of
space man had not yet penetrated ex-
cept for occasional explorations dis-
tances were so vast the three planets
out there so frigidly inimical that or-
ganized commerce had nol yet tackled
its prodigious challenge it was the
antarctica of the solar empire be-
yond saturn

  after a stop at the titanian docks for
fuel and replacements of their emptied
oxygen tanks the eti- and its
ranger convoy lumbered for wayward
iapetus it was a small glinting globe
as they approached rapidly enlarging
to reveal its jagged inhospitable sur-
face just what mysteries would soon
be unfolded there

  the ship began cruising parallel to
the wild surface upheld by underjets
captain harvey after consultation of
his chart was able to point out the
valley with the cave mouth traft
landed the ship skillfully

  back of them the space ranger set-
tled t rest its commander called
shelton

  we are under your orders sir

  very good commander gordy ill
contact you later

  shelton felt a glow of confidence
with that gun-bristling ship and
trained fighting crew at his command
he was glad now that director beatty
had seen fit to send the ship along

  shelton called a conference of his
ships total group he had commander
gordy listen in by radio

  officially were here as a survey
party and an etbi commission he
began but unofficially due to what
has come to our attention since leav-
ing earth well investigate the cave
first i think we all agree on that

there were many others around me in iiu-
tended animation chaplet x
aimriblhu  j uivilft

  the listening men nodded grim ac-
quiescence

  there shouldnt be any danger
shelton continued we have the
ranger men for armed protection so
that if there are men in the cave and
if they have a-strange new weapon and
if theyre hiding something- he
left the rest hanging captain har-
vey you and your men will accompany
me the rest will stay with the ship
myra benning was stubbornly shak-
ing her head no she said flatly
im coming along my brother
is in that cave somewhere - and
alive i want to help find him

 she hurried on before shelton
could even protest

  since weve landed ive been sure
call it intuition or anything you
want hes alive in that cave - i
know it and i must go along

  shelton still looked dubious but
traft spoke up

  let her come along rod ill keep
an eye on her

  the girl flashed him a brief smile

  a brooding atmosphere seemed to
rest over the scene as twenty vac-
suited figures stepped from the two
ships toward the black cave mouth at
the nearest cliffs base a ridiculously
tiny sun overhead barely dispelled a
deep gloom in the miniature valley
age-old untouched by natural life
the ancient surroundings were an ut-
terly alien motif against an unfamiliar
blue-black sky

  shelton cautiously led his party to
the side of the cave mouth approach-
ing it along the cliff face trafts
giant figure followed him eagerly
convinced it was a pirates nest that
must be cleaned out myra bennings
smaller form wae at his back flanked
by ranger men ready for any emer-
gency shelton had told them the sa-
lient points about the whole affair

  stooping they were able to gain
the high lip of the cave and crouch
behind it then carefully heads
were raised and eyes peered through
visors into the cave there was not
much to be seen except that it was
huge and stretched out interminably
deep shadows hung on all sides ob-
scuring detail

  see anything men asked shel-
ton his audio-vibrator carrying his
voice to all of them

  a series of negatives was his re-
sponse and shelton felt a queer sense
of disappointment

  there is something in that cave
myra bennings voice was low half
breathless i cant see anything but
i can feel it something is waiting
there waiting-

  well soon find out

  traft suddenly stood erect lighting
his hand flash and sweeping its rays
back and forth harsh startled cries
came from the cave echoed by the
walls

  there they are the big pilot
yelled triumphantly

  scurrying figures were revealed a
hundred yards back

  down you fool cried shelton
youre a perfect target-

  at that instant it struck a wave of
terrible cokjness that constricted
their lungs and turned their entire
bodies numb even the protection of
the rock lip was futile some incred-
ible force seemed to suck heat and
energy from their bodies and leave
nothing but bitter congealing ici-
ness

  shelton knew there was no time to
lose

  up men he ordered theyve
declared hostilities give em hell

  jumping up stiffly the men set their
rifles on the rock snapping on the
flashlights attached to the barrels
the flaring beams stabbed questingly
into the darkness

 trafts gun spoke first as he
sighted a dark figure at the dim
fringe of his light beam he grinned
at the harsh yell that rewarded his
aim

  then all the guns were peppering
until the cave was filled with a hollow
roar milling figures scampered back
in the dimness beyond the range of
the lights and vanished into the
shadows beyond vaguely they
could make out a huge machine be-
ing dragged back with the retreat
and the numbing cold-wave died out

  cease firing ordered shelton
that taught them a lesson his
the impossible world



voice however was oddly hoarse

  guess theyre pirates all right
boomed traft but why didnt they
sling some lead our way were they
that cocksure of never being discov-
ered and that cold business - it
doesnt add up quite right does it
rod

  no agreed shelton mark go
in there and bring out one of those
bodies well cover you with our
rifles though im sure theyve all
gone

  without a word the big pilot scram-
bled over the lip and carefully made
his way down to the cave floor wind-
ing past deep pits he reached the
first fallen body and kneeled beside
it

  uh-lord those outside heard
him say

  then he tossed the limp form over
his shoulder and clambered back to
the cave mouth he tossed the body
at their feet in the light standing
back with a dazed stare in his eyes

  slowly almost mechanically he un-
hooked his camera from his belt and
looked through the finder for a good
snap the picture would create a sen-
sation on earth

  the same dazed stare came into the
eyes of the rest of the company as
they looked at the body the thing
lying on the white rock of iapetus
lit by a feeble distant sun

  its not human whispered myra
benning recoiling in horror its
an-alien being

chapter viii

the great machine

in a vast cavern of iapetus that to
earthly senses would have been
freezingly cold and impenetrably
dark a dozen figures emerged from
their space ship they made their way
sure-footedly down the corridor
their large bulging eyes with an un-
earthly light-gathering power saw
every detail of the way by reflected
sunlight from the caverns yawning
mouth

  in sufficient light earthly eyes
would have made them out as repul-
sively alien and yet shockihgly
human in shape they were tall
giants almost by casual inventory
each had two legs two arms a
body and a head with two eyes two
ears and nose and mouth whatever
evolution had spawned them had not
seen fit to depart from that basic
structure humans thus far

  but it is in details that nature
adapts her creatures to their particu-
lar environments these creatures
were cold-blooded so that extremes
of low temperature could not bring
the chill of death in place of skin
they were equipped with a homy epi-
dermis divided into pentagonal plates
they had no hair but crests of sharp
spines stood on their heads the feet
were splayed and taloned

  reptilian the earthly observer
would say with a shudder reptilian
creatures somehow cast in the human
mold yet by a curious quirk the
hands were supple humanlike the
scales of the faces were small and
smooth the foreheads were high and
full the eyes keenly intelligent

  it would be a mistake to credit them
with low intellect solely because of
their alien attributes the reptile
species of earth were dumb witless
brutes these semi-reptilian creatures
from another world were far higher in
the scale of mentality

  the corridor opened into a large
amphitheater outfitted with a variety
of instruments none made of metal
in a thronelike chair made of some
plastic composition sat lorg the
alien superior bathed in a dim red
radiance from a cold-fire bulb

 the alien superior was more
brutish in cast than any of his sub-
jects with hulking shoulders and a
feral gleam in his cunning eyes
his air was that of one who desired
power and self-glorification ruthless-
ness was an aura about him for the
brain within his skull schemed end-
lessly toward a goal which if at-
tained would cost many lives

  he looked the recruits over with an
appraising eyes and nodded approval
they were fine specimens of his race


startling stories

young- strong and intelligent they
gazed bac-k at him with awe for he
was a combined caesar columbus and
napoleon in their conception

  welcome greeted the alien su-
perior and they saluted him his
voice to human ears would have
seemed like the hoarse bull-roar of an
alligator curiously muffled by the
thin cold air

  you all know why you are here
he said simply but austerely you
have been chosen for your courage
and your skill with machines ahead
of you lie hard work and a sacrifice
of your normal lives there is no re-
turn from here thousands have pre-
ceded you through the years the
drain of life has been large the
building of the great machine takes
its toll almost hourly besides we are
beneath the very feet of a powerful
enemy who would hound us like rats
if they discovered our presence it is
not a pleasant shadow to live under

he looked down the row of faces
that reflected youth and eager-
ness though to human eyes they
would have seemed expressionless

  are you prepared for these things
-day after day of toil sacrifice dan-
ger never to see your native planet
again

 a thunderous chorus of cheers
rolled down the dim frigid halls

  we are ready superior cried the
recruits

  good

  their leader dropped his aloof
stiff manner the speech had been
more or less of a formal ceremony
calculated to impress the newcomers
with the gravity of their mission
a general exhorting to deathless loy-
alty

  he leaned forward in his throne

  i will tell you more he confided
tensely the hour will soon come
when we will prove who has a
mightier civilization we or the earth-
men

  his cold reptilian eyes flashed mo-
mentary fire he spoke the word
earthmen with the curl of his
lips but at the same time with an un-
conscious respect napoleon might

have spoken that way of the british
whom he knew he must defeat before
he could rule the world

  this very morning he resumed
we made a thorough test of the great
machine and had it in operation for a
short time though we used the mini-
mum of power there was a displace-
ment of one full inch on our measur-
ing scale you all know from your
training in data about the great ma-
chine what that means

  the recruits stared in stunned sur-
prise the great machine had pow-
ers even greater than they had been
taught to expect then they burst out
in wild cheers at the thought of what
this meant in the near future

  up above on the surface of iapetus
rodney shelton and his party stared
long at the dead creature of unmistak-
able intelligence at their feet so like
them in general and yet so utterly
alien in detail scaled body taloned
hands and feet hooded eyes and the
crest of horny spines decorating the
head

  an alien race of intelligence on
iapetus murmured shelton in-
credulously the first known in the
solar system

  that was true man in going out
to the other planets had found him-
self unopposed master there were
evidences of a past civilization on
mars but it had passed into limbo
tens of thousands of years before
the anthropoids of venus gave
promise of future evolution toward
intelligence but that would not be for
ages to come none of the other
planets or satellites had any life above
the ape stage man was supreme

  and now here like a bolt out of no-
where was alien intelligence

  of all things exploded traft
here we came to iapetus expecting
pirates and we find alien beings

 he looked dumbfoundedly at the
long sinuous body with the torn hole
in its chest where his radi-bullet had
exploded and struck out life a thin
pale red fluid congealed in the cold air
as it trickled out

  hes not-pretty the big pilot
commented scaly reptilian living
in caves-i dont like them at first
the impossible world



   sight v

    theyre monsters breathed myra
  benning wide-eyed and trembling
  horrible beasts

    but intelligent insisted shelton
  trying to absorb that fact

    maybe theyre just savages or at
  the caveman level hazarded traft
  they dont wear clothes-at least
  this one didnt

    they dont need clothes with that
  scaly hide shelton pointed out
  and clothing is no criterion of intel-
  ligence and what about their cold
  force and perhaps that black ship
  does it mean-

  he stopped not wanting to jump
  to any conclusions what did
  it all add up to the cold force the
  black gravity ship the guarded cave
  mouth were they a troglodytic race
  inhabiting the caverns of iapetus
  and never discovered before for that
  reason how advanced were they
  how did they live what were their
  activities and plans sheltons brain
  raced with a thousand questions and
  his scientific instinct demanded the
  answers

    men shelton said suddenly fac-
  ing them weve stumbled onto
  something important-almost incred-
  ible well be making history when
  we report this whos with me to go
  further in the cave and find out more
  about these strange beings we can
  reconnoiter step by step without tak-
  ing unnecessary chances and they
  obviously cant outface our weapons
  im with you traft cried quickly
  we should find out anyway why
  these scaled people are so anxious to
  keep us out

    fired by the spark of adventure the
  other men glanced at their leaders

    we shouldnt rush into this cap-
  tain harvey said with characteristic
  caution we dont know how many
  there are or what wed be running
  into

    we could inform the authorities
 first sir by radio commander gordy
temporized however we have
plenty of ammunition

    hugh myra benning choked sud-
  denly my brother is in their hands

hes a prisoner of those monsters i
feel it

  traft nodded maybe shes right
men he was standing on the rock lip
and fell inward the aliens could have
taken him away before i searched my
light beam blinding them probably
saved me at the time but they took
hugh benning with them

  men became electrified the
thought of a hitman being one of
their own kind a captive of the aliens
sent fire through their veins if there
was anything needed to swing the de-
cision that was it every man in the
group whole-heartedly shouted to ad-
vance into the cave

  hugh benning was a good man and
we all liked him captain harvey
said himself stirred if we can res-
cue him if hes alive-

  he is alive said myra benning
firmly

  i dont suppose shelton asked the
girl studying her set face behind the
visor that theres any use trying to
convince you to stay here

  none at all assured the girl and
shelton could understand

  captain harvey insisted on a care-
ful check of their oxygen bottles
each had a supply good for at least
ten hours

  shelton called the ships via bis hel-
met-radio and informed them of the
decision to investigate the cave and
its alien denizens two of the space
rangers were detailed as guards at
the cave mouth as an added precau-
tion

  lets go shelton called he
clambered over the rock lip of the
cave leading the way

chapter ix

alien underworld

ith the gun-mounted flash-
lights illuming their path
they trailed over the uneven cave floor
avoiding shuddery pifs that perhaps
were riven gashes from some ancient
quake huge twisted stalagmites of
unguessable age loomed in their way


startling stories

now and then like great columns
overheard the flinty roof of rock
glinted with strange crystalline for-
mations in the glow of their beams
the click of trafts camera echoed
loudly in that dank dark cavern of
mystery and shadow leading to-the
unknown

  shelton almost wished he hadnt
been so impetuous in leading the men
down here the atmosphere of the
place brooding and rife with sinister
promise was weighing down his
spirit who knew what lurked ahead
what possible danger then he re-
membered the warning of the space
scientist

  but after all he had fighting men at
his back armed capable courageous
they could not be cut off at the rear
with that thought he began to feel
the thrill of leading an armed force
he a scientist only incongruous
fate could have brought thib about

  behind him myra benning hurried
along almost stumbling in her eager-
ness trafts ready grip steadied her
at times the girl had thought of her
brother alive in the hands of pirates
but humans to think of him now a
prisoner of aliens-

  the rest of the party swung along
steadily sending shafts of light on all
sides lest there be an ambush

 the cavern narrowed down to a
small corridor no more than ten feet
high and wide winding slowly
downward it seemed to stretch into
the bowels of iapetus nervous ten-
sion held the group as they trudged
deeper and deeper with untold tons
of rock hemming them in

  what a place for a murder traft
said cheerfully those beggars must
like the dark

  he peered sharply ahead secretly
hoping for a little excitement but it
was myra who first noticed a scamp-
ering shadowy figure ahead that
darted out of a niche and raced fleetly
away her sharp cry brought them
all to a halt

  their advance scout probably
surmised traft gone to tell the rest
of our little visit

 shelton captain harvey said
nervously we should turn back

this is foolhardy

  thats just your opinion  shelton
snapped back when i start a thing

i	go through with it

 commander gordy and one of his
men stepped forward if you dont
mind sir he suggested well pre-
cede you were good shots 
shelton acquiesced smiling at the
subtle way they offered their protec-
tion the party moved forward but
more slowly than before shelton was
determined to find out some little
thing about the aliens before giving
up

  he estimated they had gone perhaps
a half-mile from the cave mouth when
suddenly the corridor opened out into
a tremendous hollow space the slope
at their feet led down gradually and
the farther walls where the slope must
go up again were lost in darkness it
was a far larger cavern than shelton
had ever seen or had ever thought pos-
sible it gave one the same giddy feel-
ing as being out in empty space

hine the lights down in the hol-
low shelton commanded won-
dering what lay on the floor of this
monstrous rock chamber

  the beams stabbed along the slope
down and down their ends flared
into haziness before meeting any-
thing but faintly beyond by reflec-
tion could be seen a confused mass

  their eyes gradually adjusted to the
dim lighting revealing more detail
something tremendous was spread
there over the rock floor something
vaguely broken up into cubes and
cones and triangular spires dim red
lights hung from some of these and
shed an undependable crimson glow
barely enough to reveal architectural
details avenues ran between the
geometric structures radiating from
a hub like a gigantic spider web

  shelton blinked his eyes certain
that they were playing him tricks

  its a-city myra benning cried
excitedly the city of the aliens
standing at the brink of the slope
they took it in a city within a world
unsuspected by the outside universe
a subterranean dwelling place whose
horizons were shadows and whose sky
the impossible world

the gigantic coil at least a thousand feet long chapter xv

was solid rock and all this done by
hands other than those of men deep
within the most desolate world known
to the earth mind it was like find-
ing a great and complete city in the
middle of the sahgra or antarctica

 no it wouldnt be savages who
built that observed traft soberly
thats civilization

  shelton stared down in a trance his
brain whirling witi wild unformed
conjecture

  well he muttered at least were
sure now that theres another race in
the solar system-one approaching
our level thats important for earth
to know

  look  traft pointed with a short
laugh we seem to be creating a lit-
tle excitement down there

  milling figures in the nearer ave-
nues were running back away from
the lights throwing up their arms as
shields hoarse cries both fright-
ened and profane sounding drifted
up

  rttheyre troglodytes unused to

bright light said shelton our
flashlights must seem like blazing
suns to them he glanced t myra
you believe your brother is down
there

  she nodded a little hopelessly
yes somewhere im sure hes alive
and it mustbe here

  she stiffened suddenly leaning for-
ward with one audio-resonator of her
vac-uit toward the city her eyes
widened i seem to heat his voice
she whispered hoarsely listen care-
fully everyone

  they all heard it then a faint hal-
looing that rose above the noises o
the city and its excited inhabitants
and were instantly aware that only
earthly lungs could produce those
shouts the cries of the aliens were
distinctly different in timbre

 it must be hugh benning all
right traft was straining his eyes
downward he shouted suddenly
there he is-i see him must have
escaped hes running out of the city
up the slope-without a vac-suit
	startling stories

and theres a pack of the critters be-
hind him

  get ready to fire men shelton
yelled gripping his own rifle the
first volley over their heads to warn
them off fire

the thunderous volley rumbled
through the cavern like a tempest
but it failed to scare off the aliens
chasing benning evidently they had
been given orders they could not dis-
obey

  the flying figure of the earthman
raced up the slope with a hundred
aliens at his heels in the light grav-
ity benning made huge bounding
leaps with his earth muscles the
pursuers came along with a rapid
four-footed lope like hounds at the
chase

  come on benning trafts great
voice boomed encouragingly

  but the aliens caught up with their
quarry pulling him down myra
shrieked and darted forward wildly
but shelton held her back

  stay here he ordered tensely
then swung to the men fire he
snapped pick them off around ben-
ning

  a burst of withering gunfire poured
down the slope the aliens staggered
and fell on all sides of benning wilt-
ing they began to retreat but dragged
the earthman with them yet the dev-
astating hail of bullets began to tell
benning was struggling violently to
free himself from the dozen aliens
left

  and at that moment attack came
from another quarter

  shelton felt that now familiar
crushing numbness grip him the
aliens were projecting the cold force
from somewhere he whirled a
group of the enemy had stolen up from
the side along the slopes rim with a
gigantic instrument whose redly
glowing center was focused in their
direction

  he yelled in warning and his men
turned stiffly to blaze away at the new
threat fumbling to reload their guns
shelton groaned as he realized their
precarious situation their motions
were rapidly becoming sluggish from

the paralyzing effect of the cold force
soon they would be unable to use their
limp fingers and the battle would be
over

 to make matters worse he saw
myra benning dash away toward her
brother who was being dragged down
the slope she was running right into
the arms of the enemy shelton
leaped up like a wound spring
bounding after her

  traft blazing away at the attackers
cursed and leaped after them he had
promised on earth to stick at shel-
tons side at all times now was one
of those times

  the three racing figures reached
the aliens at almost the same time
myra swung futile fists at them an
alien loomed over her with a snarl
raising his hand to strike shelton
jammed his gun in the brutes mid-
section and fired another alien
wrenched the gun out of his hands
shelton began swinging his gauntlet-
ed fists with a surge of joy each time
a scaly chin cracked under his ham-
mering blows

  traft had leaped into the fray with
his rifle clubbed growling swinging
right and left his powerful blows
brought howls of pain from the enemy
many fell to lie still with battered
skulls but more pressed up from the
city completely surrounding them

faced with certain defeat by
sheer weight of numbers shelton
kept fighting automatically perhaps
the men above the slope could yet turn
the tide but his last hope died when
he glanced up and saw them tottering
falling stiffly their rifle fire died
away to sporadic shots then stopped
altogether

 cold force-numb- came cap-
tain harveys choked voice by the hel-
met radio cant hold out-

  his swaying vac-suited figure the
last standing toppled over to lie
among those of the other men shel-
ton knew that they lay still unbreath-
ing behind their visors caught in the
pseudo-death of suspended animation
the cold red eye of the cold force pro-
jector was turned off having done its
work
the impossible world



  shouting triumphantly at this vic-
tory the aliens surrounded shelton
and his patty and quickly bore them
down even trafts great strength
was unable to shake off a dozen cling-
ing forms that twisted his arms behind
him benning was already being car-
ried off unconscious from his exer-
tions in a cojd thin atmosphere unfit
for laboring earth lungs

  panting exhausted the three earth
people were prodded down the slope
to the city-to what fate shelton
didnt know and was almost past car-
ing bitterly he realized they had
fallen into a trap the empty cavern
the way open to the city-it added up
to that

 had the aliens known they would
come for benning or had they banked
on human curiosity how much did
they know of humans sheltons
brain was tortured with queries

as they approached the unearth-
like city was weird with its dim
red glow windowless buildings o
geometric harshness of design stared
blackly metal was nowhere apparent
even in his extremity shelton notfced
that

  the four prisoners were taken to a
building standing alone on the fringe
of the city there was a hissing sound
as a door swung open was it an air-
lock such it turned out to be and
they were shoved into a lock-cham-
ber bennings senseless form with
them trafit quickly lifted benning
in his arms as an inner door opened
and they stepped through

  the large chamber beyond to their
amazement was outfitted with earthly
furniture or more properly with the
fittings of a space ships cabin-bunks
stfrap-chairs and even a washstand out-
fitted with a water tank shelton saw
the name galileo in black letters
painted across the tank a ship of the
exploration service reported lost
years ago i

  traft had already opened his visor
sniffed at the air he began stripping
off his suit

 earth normal pressure and
warmed he said with forced cheer-
fulness were prisoners but we
may as well be comfortable

  shelton and myra followed his ex-
ample glad to be free of the encum-
bering vac-suits they were not too
curious at the moment as to how such
a chamber as this existed

  not much had been spoken among
them since the battle a depressed
silence had weighed their tongues
but now the girl burst into sudden
tears

  its my fault she sobbed for
making you men go-

  of course not snapped shelton
we just didnt know what we were
running into this thing is turning
out to be bigger more amazing than
we could suspect first of all we have
to revive your brother find out from
him all we can about the aliens

  hugh bennings physical condition
approached that of a man who had
been lying on a mountain top exposed
to its bitter conditions his skin was
blue bis breathing labored he
moaned and twitched at times

  shelton strode to a medicine cabinet
he had already seen reposing in a cor-
ner also taken from an earth ship
he returned with a chemical warming
pad and stimulants that gradually
brought the unconscious man around
they waited breathlessly

  but suddenly a large round screen
on the wall before them flickered with
spangled lights though of strange
design it was an opti-screen a mo-
ment later the features of an alien
peered out at them with an expression
they could only interpret as sardonic
large greenish eyes flicked from one
to che other as though surveying
specimens in a goldfish bowl

  well traft rumbled insultingly
what are you staring at you two-
footed snake i wish you could talk
our language id-

  i do speak your language

  these words spoken clearly with a
precise accent coming from an ut-
terly alien creature of non-earthly
	startling stories

origin brought incredulous cries of
surprise from the three earth people
it was more astounding almost than
any of the crazy events of the past
hours

traft had lost his voice his
mouth agape but shelton recov-
ered and stepped before the screen
he stared directly into the enigmatic
unblinking eyes

  who are you he demanded

 the alien face drew up in what
might have been a smile

  i am lorg a superior of my peo-
ple the torms as you would say i
am one of their rulers you are sur-
prised that i know your language i
have known it for many years our
instruments pick up your earth radio
programs and thus i hear your lan-
guage constantly

 why have we been imprisoned
shelton demanded retribution will
follow at the hands of earth authori-
ties if you hold us against our will
he glared at the alien-superior in
a boiling anger that had been accumu-
lating since the capture

  i am not easily intimidated lorg
said harshly you will remain here
at my will you are out of touch with
the earth authorities they will not
interfere you will be treated well
shelton cooled down suddenly
passing a hand over his forehead

  what is this all about he asked
wearily as if talking to himself
just what do you want with us
you are dr rodney shelton of
etbi lorg stated blandly we
will have much to talk about later
abruptly the image in the screen
faded away with a queer expression
that human eyes could not interpret

 he even knows my name who i
am murmured shelton

  he threw up his hands it was all
an insoluble soul-shaking mystery
and each succeeding event seemed
more cryptic

  hugh myra benning was saying
in a glad voice youre awake thank
god-

  benning had finally opened his eyes
with a sharp horror in them but this
died away as he stared around eagerly

at their faces he struggled to sit up
myra helping and grinned at them
weakly

  hello hugh  traft boomed heart-
ily gripping his hand he gave shel-
ton a brief introduction

  glad youre here hugh benning
said fervently three weeks among
the torms- he shuddertd you
cant imagine the feeling of being the
only one of your kind among
aliens-

  shelton patted him on the back
soothingly take it easy old man
begin at the beginning and tell us
what happened he realized that
they could nt rush the man into tell-
ing what he knew of the aliens

  hugh benning nodded he was a
small slight man with a studious air
about him his knowledge of science
as myra had previously revealed was
extensive he had been with the
planetary survey as one of its best
technical men

  i was standing on the rock lip of
the cave at that time you know about
looking in he finally began sud-
denly i was choking and turning
numb i felt myself falling then
everything went black i woke up in
a big room filled with instruments i
thought it was a nightmare when i
first saw the aliens

  again he shuddered id been ly-
ing in a sort of glass coffin there
were many more around me in tiers
containing other humans in suspend-
ed animation i had come out f it
for some reason a big machine stood
in the center of the room radiating
bright colored rays i think it was
some kind of mind-reading process
because i felt my mind being probed
searched revealed

 b is eyes were dull with perplex-
u ity im not sure what it was
all i know was that i broke out of my

flass container like a maniac and ran
rom the horrible place aliens pur-
sued me i went unconscious from
the thin air and cold i woke up in
this room since then my one thought
has been to get away when i saw
your lights at the top of the slope
from tfce window i went wild the
the impossible world



jailer had just come in with food for
me i knocked him down and ran
out

  he shivered it was cold and cruel
to my lungs but i knew i could stand
it for a few minutes i ran toward
you-the rest you know

  his story brief and jerky left an
aura of horror in the minds of his lis-
teners more by reason of what was left
unsaid rather than what he had told

  do you know anything definite
about all this asked shelton these
aliens and what theyre doing plan-
ning

  bennings eyes went bleak just
enough to give me an awful fright
when i think what it might mean he
said his voice shocked i didnt tell
you but i escaped once before while
i still had my vac-suit handy it had
a few hours oxygen-supply and i fig-
ured to get to the surface i got there
all right slipping past the guards-to
find the ship gone i was marooned
the guards chased me back down but
i managed to elude capture hiding in
shadows i suppose i went a little
mad then i crept past the city-
his voice became tense this is only
one part of their community there
are other chambers beyond one is
filled with big black space ships an-
other with thousands of cold force
projectors several others-his eyes
were stark-with dozens of bodies of
earthmen in those glass coffins in
suspended animation men from miss-
ing expeditions

  the devils cried shelton white-
lipped what-

  wait benning went on theres
something still more significant i
looked down a deep shaft it seemed
to be miles down there is a gigantic
workshop and some great machine-
he drew a breath-some great ma-
chine i think it means danger to the
whole solar system

  why asked shelton startled at
the bare suggestion

  benning shook his head i cant
tell you why i dont know but i do
know it represents a great science
perhps superior to ours he low-
ered his voice these people dont
use metals they use plastics look

at the walls which arent stone the
window which isnt glass the whole
city which hasnt a scrap of metal in
it they use plastics for everything
plastics echoed shelton why
should that-

  the science of plastics is not a sim-
ple one benning said with an as-
sured scientific air it is just begin-
ning on earth we know of celluloid
cellophane bakelite and so on they
are the basic simples of a possible in-
dustry supplying every material need
of mankind these people have gone
into it deeply they have plastics
harder than steel clearer than glass
more lasting than stone and all
made of chemical ingredients at low
temperatures they dont have to use
elaborate blast furnaces coal power
or dig ores theirs is a laboratory
civilization if there ever was one

he waved a hand suddenly its
mainly conjecture on my part
but-his face went haggard-i have
the feeling all this activity within
iapetus spells danger to the space
empire it broods in the air here
it-

  the empire can take care of it-
self  traft burst out belligerently
when the time comes why these
fish-eyed aliens havent even guns if
it came to war earths space navy
could surround iapetus and bottle
them up

  dont underestimate their cold
force weapon benning said quietly
it can be as effective as a heat force
theyre probably developing it day by
day as for iapetus this is not their
native world

  shelton nodded  surmised that
iapetus is barren of native life but
where have they come from

  benning shrugged uranus nep-
tune or pluto they are a race in-
ured to cold hating light it must be
one of those three

  or all three

  shelton was sudenly pacing up and
down some of irfmings conjectures
had seemed wild the ravings of a man
whose imagination had been touched
off by three weeks in a strange dark
world of aliens but now sheltan felt


startling stories

that the true scope of it might be still
more incredible

  saturn he said has been earths
frontier beyond lies the unknown
ive seen the official records not often
revealed more than half the explora-
tion ships that have gone beyond sat-
urn have never returned natural
hazards the official epitaph is i won-
der

  traft tied things together sweep-
ingly looks like the aliens on pluto
neptune and uranus are expanding
inward while earth is expanding out-
ward where the two meet here at
saturn-hell will pop

  were painting a pretty lurid pic-
ture muttered shelton dazed by the
tremendous implications of it

  he shook his head it might ail be
a poisonous mushroom blooming from
the spores of undigested facts they
must get down to basic facts he
turned to benning

  but why has this room been pre-
pared with earth conditions for live
prisoners

  i cant guess admitted the tech-
nologist theyve fed me kept
earth-pressure here and warmth
they havent mistreated me ive just
been sitting here brooding marooned
surrounded by aliens thinking -
thinking-

  he was sobbing suddenly and myra
comforted him they realized what
he had gone through it was plain in
his sensitive lined face the marks of
an experience no human could have
passed through without mental scars

chapter xi

dash jor freedom

lorg the alien superior sat in
his seat of authority he turned
as murv his second-in-command en-
tered and advanced with quick tread
murv stopped before him and saluted
respectfully

  lorg he said in their own speech
we must try arbitration with the
earthlings now that the hour draws
near they are more powerful than

you think that has been part of our
plan from the first and for that reason
the earth-conditioned room was pre-
pared you have in it now their dr
rodney shelton a high official with
a voice of authority through him
you can arbitrate with the earthly gov-
ernment

  as the superior shook his head the
spines of his head swayed

  i think it will be useless at this
point he objected we are ready to
strike after the first point in our
plans is carried out then will be the
time to talk they will be im-
pressed

  they will be enraged murv in-
sisted take care that you do not
ruin everything lorg best that you
arbitrate now and-he spoke firm-
ly-do not make your demands too
high

  who are you to speak thus to me
shrilled the superior rising angrily

  the voice of those of crnr people
who do not want a war with the earth-
lings returned murv eyeing lorg
steadily

  all right  he snapped i will at-
tempt arbitration but i make my
own demands and follow my own
judgment thereafter

  once again the opti-screen in the
earth peoples prison chamber flared
with pulsing lights the alien su-
perior gazed down at them singling
out shelton

  dr rodney shelton began lorg
you have authority i believe that
can connect directly with your su-
preme earth government what you
say they will believe-and consider

  yes snapped shelton but how
do you know that  how-

  the sounds made by the alien might
have been amused laughter

 do not be astounded he mur-
mured we have been in contact with
earth affairs for a long time not only
through radio but by gleaning infor-
mation from earth minds-those
whose bodies we have in suspended
animation we developed the cold
force for that purpose as well as for a
weapon the cold fofce is a pseudo-
magnetic field that absorbs all elec-
trical nerve currents in the human
the impossible world

greeley followed with two more of the stricken
men chapter i

body the nerves become dead
frozen but without affecting any of
the other organs

  those bodies in suspended anima-
tion are a library of information to us
we are far more fully aware of your
affairs than you would believe possi-
ble we know much of your science
history social structure and your in-
terplanetary program of expansion
daily we gather more information
with our psychic-extractor appara-
tus

  shelton was tense with horror at the
thought of human bodies kept in the
pseudo-death like mechanical records
for the aliens to delve into their
minds

      think i can promise you he
jsaid harshly that when earth
finds out about this you will be blast-
ed out of existence you have done
things that make you a bitter enemy
of mankind 

  those men are unharmed re-
turned the alien half apologetically
the psychic-extraction does not af-
fect them i would not wish to earn
the wrath you promise i wish to open
arbitration with earth in fact

  for what shelton asked bluntly
for control-absolute undivided
control-of certain planets you
might call it a ceding of planets
there it was staring them starkly
in the face shelton was staggered a
little though it had not been a com-


startling stories

plete surprise he was being asked to
inform his home authority that an un-
suspected outside power an alien race
from somewhere beyond saturn
wanted planets for its own empire it
was utterly fantastic

  which planets he managed to
query trying to keep cool

  pluto neptune uranus saturn
and jupiter-and all their moons
lorg calmly informed my race is
very prolific the three outer planets
are ours in all but name already our
people inhabit them we are asking
only for recognition there of what al-
ready is ours but saturn and ju-
piter in addition must be ceded to
us by earth

  the four earth people looked at one
another was this some monstrous
joke spawned in the mind of an alien
who aspired to an impossible tin-pot
empire

  you cant be serious retorted
shelton he suddenly laughed short-
ly the thing was ridiculous

  lorgs alien features drew up tight-
ly in what was obvious even to earth
eyes as outraged anger

  cease your laughter earthling
he snarled his repugnant face thrust-
ing forward in the screen those are
my demands if i must i am prepared
to take saturn and jupiter the day
of earthly dominion over them is fin-
ished i lorg say it

  shelton was quickly in the grip of
equal anger

  taka them he blazed against
all the earth forces you are mad
lorg earth might conceivably waive
jurisdiction over the three outer
planets since you say your race in-
habits them but saturn and jupiter
are out of the question

  lorg had turned his face and spoke
lo someone unseen by the earthlings
nor could they guess that what he said
was you see murv arbitration is
impossible

  they heard another voice answer
but did not understand when murv
answered in the alien tongue

  your demands are too high saturn
and jupiter are theirs

  only the tone of lorgs reply you
anger me murv go was under-

standable to the four as lorg turned
back to the mystified earth people

  we shall see about arbitration dr
rodney shelton he said ominously
perhaps earth will soon be glad to
do so at my terms 

  wait said shelton thoughtfully
perhaps it would be best after all
ill do it lorg

  the other three stared at shelton
was it possible he had been cowed by
the alien  he seemed to look so the
alien superior peered at him nar-
rowly

  i know what goes on in your mind
earthling he said shortly you
would simply make that an excuse to
contact earth and have warships come
winging fool i would know of a
way to prevent you but no matter
now i have decided not to arbitrate
at this time

  his image vanished

shelton lurched away from the
opti-screen sank weakly into a
chair the stark revelation of the past
few minutes was almost more than
the human mind could accept with-
out he felt going mad

  holy jupiter traft was exclaim-
ing wants five planets for his em-
pire and apparently is ready to fight
for them he balled his fists he
wont be so eager after a taste of the
kind of war earth people put up in
big doses

  thats the trouble sheltons
voice was worried think once
what fighting forces have we actual
fighting forces ah the space navy
has had to worry about is traffic duty
in the spaceways rescue of stranded
ships and battling a few pirates in
total the navy consists of only a
dozen battleships built just in case a
few hundred space rangers and a few
thousand ligfytly armed ships that
havent fired a gun in years

  he made a sweeping gesture sup-
pose the enemy planning long have
thousands and thousands of ships-
he stopped appalled at his own sug-
gestion

  traft was unworried what good
would superiority in space battles do
them granting that we have people
the impossible world



on jupiter and saturn their space
ships couldnt fight ground forces
theyd need ground forces and i
doubt they can stand up under the
sun without going blind and get-
ting a heat stroke unless they were
bio-conditioned but they dont know
about that

  shelton suddenly went cold un-
less they were bio-conditioned was
that where he came in in the aliens
plan

  he jumped up

  talk is useless he ejaculated
forcefully earth must be warned
earth must strike first-wipe out this
alien nest if we could only get in
touch with our men in the ships on
the surface-

  he strode to their vac-suits and
grabbed up his own with the helmet-
radio attachment he snapped it on
holding the helmet upside down and
spoke tensely into the tiny micro-
phone

  etbi-fourteen attention etbi-
fourteen attention shelton calling
he tried this for long minutes be-
fore he gave up not enough range
as i expected he groaned hopeless-
ly the helmet-radios were for suit to
suit converse at short ranges of a few
hundred feet he whirled weve got
to get to the surface

  guards outside muttered hugh
benning theyll be more watchful
since i made my break

  never mind about guards traft
rumbled grimly

  but theyd run us down benning
said in a monotone and we have no
guns

  the four looked at one another
helplessly they had priceless vital
information that should go to earth
and no way to transmit it

  shelton paced up and down with a
concentrated frown get thinking
all of you he urged one way or
another weve got to escape

  traft made a mental inventory
aloud no guns no lights no weap-
ons of any sort were outnumbered
a hundred to one we have to have
some way of holding them off for
about ten minutes while running up
the slope

  light would do it mused shelton
bright light alone their eyes are
extremely sensitive to light and
therefore blinded by what to us is
normal light

traft was looking around
theres not a thing here to help
us he growled no flashlights can-
dles or even matches

 matches murmured benning
tonelessly they would be useless
anyway things dont burn in the
thin iapetus air

 myra benning less despondent
than her brother pointed at the glo-
bular bulb hanging from the ceiling
shedding its pale reddish glow over
the room

  can we use that

  shelton shook his head too dim
some kind of cold light without blue
rays we need something with strong
blue rays they are the strongest
he snapped his fingers suddenly
listen all of you he held up the
helmet-radio at which he had been
staring if we can find a way to
short the battery and produce an arc
wed get a bright light much brighter
than our flashlights were an arc
would blind them so thoroughly wed
have a chance to get away well
try it how about you benning
can you go out there without a suit
again

  benning nodded ill go as far as i
can

  and after that ill carry you
finished traft lets get set-
ready for them when they come with
food

 when three aliens entered with
food a little later they let out hoarse
cries as three determined earthmen
attacked with whirlwind speed ben-
ning tripped one and struck him on
the head with a table leg shelton
knocked his adversary out with a
clean uppercut traft disposed of
the third with a hammerlike blow to
the forehead taken by surprise the
aliens were easy prey although in a
normal fight they might have been
more effective using their taloned
hands

  come on


startling stories

  shelton hustled myra into the lock
left open by the aliens the others fol-
ing a moment later the outer
seal flung open automatically after
the inner seal had closed they
stepped out

  hugh benning gasped as he met the
frigid sparse air outside but set his
lips grimly a doen outside guards
stared for a moment in surprise then
leaped forward shelton was fum-
bling with his gauntled hands at the
two bare wires he had previously
drawn from the radio coils at the
peak of his helmet he touched the
wires and then drew them slightly
apart

  a blinding blue radiance shot from
the contact as hot sparks sizzled
across the gap in the thin air con-
ditions were ideal for a high voltage
spark the advancing aliens let out
painful shrieks as the glaring light
bathed their light-sensitive eyes
they flung up their arms and stag-
gered back

  shelton set the lead away from the
city up the slope it was a long
stretch if the arc lasted till the top
they were not likely to be cut off
they would have to take their chances
with any cold beams

  as they bounded up the incline the
whole city seemed to burst into
movement aliens rushed from all
sides shouting in their queer disso-
nant tones but the blazing arc at the
top of sheltons helmet kept them off
they would approach within thirty or
forty feet try to run against the light
with face averted and finally reel
back rubbing their tortured eyes

to them shelton knew it was like
running toward a hot incandes-
cent furnace whose beams would burn
their eyes out and whose heat
crackled on their scaly skin skin on
which water at just above the freez-
ing point would have felt like live
steam

  once in a while the arc sputtered
and shelton had to reach up quickly
to adjust the gap several times the
instantly numbing force of a cold
beam struck at them and made them
stumble but each time it died away

as quickly the operators were hav-
ing a hard time focusing on what to
them looked like an unveiled sun

  on and on they raced time and
again the aliens would have cut them
off except for the blue-bright ball of
fire they could not face but gradu-
ally the arc weakened the small bat-
teries were being quickly drained
with a hundred feet to go the arc
flickered out entirely

  instantly the aliens leaped forward
in the dark which was normal to them
traft at the rear began lashing out
with pummeling fists fighting them
off a dynamic whirlwind he pro-
tected the other three completely
they gained the top shelton whirled
to help traft but saw he wasnt
needed the big pilot had just picked
up an alien bodily and flung him
among the rest then he dashed up
grunting exultantly

brazenly he stood for a moment at
the slopes rim taking a camera snap
as a gesture of defiance to the aliens
you and that fool camera barked
shelton come onl

  a cold beam bit at their muscles
but they staggered through into the
corridor leading to the surface here
they knew they could easily get away
protecting their rear the aliens did
not even follow as though shirking
the prospect of facing the fierocious
earthmen in a narrow space

  hugh benning let out a bubbling
gasp suddenly and collapsed traft
caught him and swung him to his
shoulder without lessening his pace

 made it panted shelton
though well have to watch for
guards at the cave mouth

chapter xii

message to earth

hen the glow of the city be-
hind them died away stygian
gloom slowed them down shelton
fumbled with the wires and managed
to e-ke a little more current out of the
batteries enough to give a dim sput-
tering radiance it served to warn of
the impossible world



outjutting rocks and treacherous un-
derfooting

  but finally the glow of the cave
mouth appeared ahead like a steady
candle and they entered the large
cavern the guard detail of aliens
evidently warned of their coming had
their path blocked with their cold
beam projector its paralyzing grip
touched them

  shelton raised his voice in a shout
to the two rangers that had been left
on guard two flashlight beams
stabbed into the cavern centered on
the earthmen for a minute and then
swung to the aliens guns spoke and
with wild cries the aliens flung them-
selves flat shelton and his party
raced past

 the two rangers greeted them
warmly

  glad youre back sir they said
saluting shelton we were about to
organize a search party where are
the others

  no time to explain now shelton
said shortly and headed for the ship

  the sun had set the desolate
topography of iapetus was eerily lit
by a blend of starlight and the reddish
glow of saturn hanging like a moon
in the sky the scene was quiet
peaceful shelton found it hard to
believe they had just returned from
a bustling city deep underground
it had all been like a nightmare
tumultuous and unreal

  within the welcome interior of the
etb- again the bruised and bat-
tered party took off their vac-suits
and basked in the warmth of the ship
shelton left all explanations for traft
to make and dashed for the pilots
cupola he jerked over the radio stud

  dr rodney shelton of etbi call-
ing from iapetus he barked into the
microphone titan station please
answer immediately

  he repeated the call several times
using the full power of the ships
radio waiting for the return call
he fidgeted nervously cursing radio
operators who couldnt see blinking
signal lights before their very eyes
at last a rather sleepy voice an-
swered

  titan station go ahead dr shel-

ton

  emergency he snapped get
this and get it right call the navy
outposts both yours and on rhea
and say i want every fighting ship
available here at iapetus as soon as
possible there is to be no delay
thi is a matter of vital importance
tell them an alien menace is here that
requires their presence every fight-
ing ship is that clear

  his keenly stirred mind seizing on
the smallest details shelton timed the
reply just right-forty seconds from
titan at opposition to iapetus three
million miles back and forth

  the operators voice was no longer
sleepy but puzzled this is such an
unusual request sir he objected
are you sure -  he broke off
please give me opti-screen eontact
dr shelton routine you under-
stand

  shelton growled but was aware
that the operator had the right to be
startled and careful this was per-
haps the most momentous call that
had ever hummed across the ether
lines shelton switched on the icono-
scope and adjusted its electrodes
rapidly to catch his face clearly in di-
rect focus

ow he declared knowing
he would be recognized i
want those ships immediately then
call me back just to make it stronger
and avoid any delaying red-tape he
added if you question my author-
ity youre questioning the authority
of extra-terra bio-institute under-
stand

  forty seconds later yes dr shel-
ton ill call the outposts imme-
diately and then call you back
the operators excited voice clipped
off

  ten minutes later his signal light
flickered and shelton rushed back
from the pilot port he had been star-
ing out at space beyond saturn won-
dering where out there lay the alien
civilization that had sprung upon the
ken of man with such blinding threat-
ening swiftness

  titan station reporting said the
operator alertly both navy out-


startling stories

posts have answered dr shelton
they will send all available ships as
quickly as possible though it will
take a little time to organize the de-
tails the rhea outpost says it will
have five rangers there in about eight
hours others to follow anything
else bir

 yes shelton stated put me
through on a line to radio-central
earth right away

  go ahead dr shelton acknowl-
edged the titan operator after the
appropriate time lapse

 shelton spoke slowly and dis-
tinctly

  radio-central earth dr rodney
shelton of expedition ship etbi-
fcmtrteen calling attention director
grant beatty by transcription if
necessary say this director beatty
ive been on iapetus just ten hours
and in those ten hours the incredible
has happened aliens intelligent be-
ings are on iapetus thats a bare
unbelievable statement i know it will
shock you

  shelton went on to give the details
as far as he thought necessary

   and so director he concluded
rimly this alien menace has been
owering secretly on the three outer
plants they are looking inward
they have a foothold in our empire
on iapetus they must never get any
further i dont know what powers
the aliens have but they must have
a highly developed science it is evi-
dent from what weve seen and heard
lorg the superior as he calls him-
self radiated confidence that he could
get what they wanted by force if not
arbitration i can only describe him
as a devilish character capable of
deviiish plans and deeds

 carried by humming radio waves
across the deep gulf of interplanetary
space sheltons voice became hard
inflexible

  my idea is to force their hand
ive called for all available fighting
ships from titan and rhea send
from earth a fleet of whatever ships
can be spared if necessary the
aliens must be blasted out of iapetus i
i know director beatty that youll
want me to leave iapetus immediately

when you hear this but im staying
dont waste breath begging demand-
ing or cajoling me back right now
im here to see this thing through
ill open negotiations with the aliens
as soon as the first ships arrive ill
await acknowledgment of this call

shelton turned away from the
radio heaving a great sigh
earth had been informed regardless
of what happened to him the most im-
portant thing had been taken care of

  as he stepped away the signal light
flashed signifying another call shel-
ton turned back and started as the
strangely leering face of lorg the
alien superior rippled into the glow-
ing opti-screen 

  you made a clever escape dr rod-
ney shelton remarked the alien im-
perturbably you earthlings are re-
sourceful i also overheard your re-
cent radio message the voice be-
came ominous it will avail you
nothing earthman i am ready to
strike you will be too late with your
attack

  well see about that shelton
drawled easily when our armed
space ships are ready to blast away
if you attack me tonight remember
that i have an armed space ship with
me and several expert gunners

  i will not attack you scoffed
lorg it is not necessary in the
least a queer expression flitted
across his repugnant features and the
hoarse cackle that came from his lips
made sheltons nerves grate i say
only one thing to you watch at
dawn he cackled again omin-
ously watch at dawn earthman

  down in his chamber the alien-
superior turned from his screen
when sheltons face had vanished

  go he commanded his aide
spread the word the hour has
come

  the aide saluted and sped away his
face gleaming

  murv who was there pressed his
lips together you have made your
move lorg he said quietly let us
hope it was the right one you have
incurred the wrath of the earth peo-
ple i have often told you of their
hl impumbljl wualu

dangerousness when aroused the
chance for peaceful arbitration may
be lost forever

  lorgs ruthless face flared with
anger murv you annoy me with
your childish fears go he added
a threat and take care that i do not
depose you from all authority one of
these days if you try to hinder me
murv turned away with a shrug his
face stony   

  in deep thought shelton made his
way from the pilots cupola to the

war between

in the next issue of startling stories

horror at the fate of those who had
not returned from the cavern of alien
menace

  shelton briefly gave the details of
his radio calls then he counted his
forces the three engine men two
etbi men two rangers here and two
left as guard in their ship-twelve
men including himself and a girl

 he turned to the rangers you
two go back to your ship keep one
man on guard in case anything pops
during the night

main cabin why was the alien su-
perior so confident what did he
have up his sleeve watch at dawn
what was going to happen at dawn

  the occupants of the cabin looked
up at sheltons preoccupied haggard
face myra benning had nursed her
brother back to consciousness but he
lay weakly in a bunk still breathing
stertorously traft had just finished
telling the story of their experiences
underground the listening men
were looking at each other in shocked

  they saluted and left when the
air-seal had hissed shut again shelton
swung on his two etbi men

ouve made preliminary
tests of the iapetus conditions
-enough to give a rough approxima-
tion of bio-conditioning steps

  not quite finished answered one
of the biologists couple hours work
on it yet

  then well finish it now shelton
decided we must transmit the data

the worlds
w

to earth in case it comes to the
point-his eves blazed-where bio-
conditioned fighting men are needed
to rout out the aliens mark you stick
at the radio for any calls you three
engineers keep watch at the ports
lorg said he wouldnt attack us but i
dont trust him they might try to
come sneaking up in the night miss
benning-his voice became gentler
as he turned to the worn girl-
youd better get some rest this has
been a trying day for you

  im going to help you dr shel-
ton she quickly interposed hughs
asleep and wont need me

  shelton admired the way she had
drawn herself together

  incidentally he said youve done
a great service to the empire
through your search for your brother
the aliens were discovered sooner
lock at it that way not that you led
brave men to a living death they can
yet be rescued but with the alien
menace uncovered weve stolen a
march on them

  the girls eyes brightened it had
not been pleasant to think of her part
in the half-tragic events since the
landing

  but weve work to do

  shelton led the way to the small but
completely equipped laboratory in the
back of the ship they plunged into
their work the iapetus air was
checked and rechecked for density
pressure and mean temperature cos-
mic radiation was recorded by means
of a sensitive geiger counter an
anesthecized guinea pig was put in a
pressure tube dosed with adaptene
and his reactions to iapetus condi-
tions noted his blood count taken

  rough hurried approximations they
were but shelton knew he must race
against time data went down rapidly
under myras flying fingers

chapter xiii
at dannf

as soon as trafts voice thundered
down from the pilot room an-

nouncing the return earth call shel-
ton hastily grabbed up the single rec-
ord sheet and raced up

  mark he demanded rapidly add-
ing a few words at the top of the
paper you know the secret code of
your planetary survey service

  like i know my own name as-
sured traft readily pushing aside his
dry chemical developing kit with
which he had been making prints

  code this

  shelton turned to the radio direc-
tor beattys forceful face half twisted
out of shape with amazement was in
the screen only three hours had
elapsed since sheltons call it was
probably a record for a return call
across the stupendous nine-hundred-
million-mile stretch between earth
and saturn

  director beatty calling dr rod-
ney shelton on iapetus said the
images lips your message was re-
ceived in full i need hardly say its
the most startling news i or the world
ever received an intelligent unsus-
pected alien race in the solar system
-an underground city at the doorstep
of the empire-miraculous science
if it were anybody else but you re-
porting that shelton id refuse to be-
lieve it

  a hand reached up to mop a sweat-
ing brow an armed earth fleet is
already being organized they will ar-
rive at iapetus in four days at mul-
tiple acceleration we cant tolerate
any subversive program defying our
jurisdiction on the planets saturn
and all its moons are an official part of
our empire the aliens musf leave or
be driven away

  the directors eyes stared out com-
mendingly at shelton everything
youve done is right shelton but
dont go any further youve exposed
the aliens when the first armed ships
arrive from rhea simply have them
on guard officials will arrive with
the fleet from earth to take up nego-
tiations the eyes twinkled slightly
i should command you to leave for
earth immediately however i
wont to bave you the embarrassment
of a court martial later im trusting
you not to be reckless
fmraiwwsieli wuklu

  his voice became serious but this
is a grave situation facing the empire
how grave i suppose none of us
knows yet report to me the instant
anything new comes up signing

  the bearded face faded from the
screen but shelton hurriedly called
the titan relay station for another
line to earth radio-central

  director beatty he called when
the connection was completed after
i sent my message to you lorg the
alien superior called me he had lis-
tened in he is probably listening
now so im sending the rest in secret
code planetary survey

  he went on in the code that traft
was rapidly transposing from the rec-
ord sheet calling out letter by letter
swiftly and clearly the decoded
message ran

  important to leave nothing to chance
have thousand men bio-conditioned for
iapetus in case needed to storm under-
ground city data follows

  sheltons voice droned on for an-
other half hour with the laboring
traft barely able to keep ahead with
his coding finally it was done and
shelton heaved a sigh of relief

  there he said were another
jump ahead of the aliens

down in the main cabin a tan-
talizing odor met them with
the limited facilities of the ship myra
benning had managed to prepare an
appetizing meal shelton was hungry
despite the cheerless situation and
for awhile they were able to keep up
a dinner conversation free of the
thoughts uppermost in their minds re-
laxing somewhat from their tense-
ness

  we have four hours till dawn said
shelton consulting the chart of iape-
tus day-and-night periods he
yawned the ships from rhea will
be here two hours later lets get
some sleep till then wehl have one
man on guard turn about

  this arranged they went to their
separate bunks shelton threw himself
down fully clothed his head hum-
med with the breath-taking events
that had burst like a bombshell into
the course of things many things

had been answered since the day on
earth when the ship tycho had land-
ed with two alive out of a crew of ten
but many things remained to be an-
swered in what bizarre way would
they be revealed

  sheltons nerves quieted as he be-
came drowsy he felt satisfaction in
how it had all turned out so far in
a few hours armed earth ships would
arrive to hold the aliens at bay yet
in the back of his mind like a haunt-
ing refrain thrummed lorgs strange
words watch at dawn what
could it mean

  he turned over he had the watch
at that period he would watch at
dawn he slept   

  a hand shook sheltons shoulders
he awoke from a troubled sleep
nerves throbbing

  your watch sir said the engirreer
whose vigil was over

  shelton arose and made his way
through the dimmed cabin to the
pilots cupola where a sweeping vision
all around the ship was possible he
stared around at the desolate barren
landscape glinting somberly in star-
light saturn had set in the sky of
iapetus soon the sun would rise

  shelton pressed a hand to his fore-
head wondering why his nerves
should be jangling so much sudden-
ly he started was it his nerves or
was it his whole body the whole ship
and the very ground it stood on ab-
ruptly shelton realized that was so
a subtle vibration trembled through
the entire ship he was aware now
too that he had felt that steady tremor
in his sleep for at least an hour

  he pressed his feet firmly to the
floor the strongest vibration came
from below from the ground was it
some sort of iapetus quake it felt
as though the whole satellite were
quivering and trembling the aliens
-underground did it have any con-
nection with them

  the sun rose small and feeble
though its reflection wa it made an
appreciable contrast to dark night
shafts of light speared down dispell-
ing shadows gleaming from crystal-
line peaks it was strangely haunt-
ingly beautiful this sunrise on an-
other world but sheltons mind kept
humming those relentless maddening
phrases watch at dawn watch at
dawn 

  shelton glanced at the chronometer
above the pilots keyboard and a
startled cry burst from his lips

  the dawn had been ten minutes
late

  the electrically - operated clock
could not be wrong the chart of ia-
petus rotation could not be wrong
yet the sun had peeped above the ho-
rizon fully ten minutes behind time

sheltons face was white
drained of blood his hands were
trembling fitfully his heart skipped
a beat then began to pound furiously
for of all the things that man depends
on with a blind faith it is the clock-
work of the heavens the certainty
of sunset and sunrise on split second
schedule for ages on end without fail
whether on earth or any other world
what is it rod

  traft spoke from the door the
others were behind him awakened by
his involuntary cry which had re-
sounded through the still ship

  ten minutes late shelton whis-
pered hoarsely the sun-

  what roared traft blinking
dumfoundedly you must be wrong
rod that would mean the rotation
of this whole satellite has changed
hugh benning ran forward grabbed
up the space sextant and trained it
then compared its readings to the chart
of iapetus rotation and revolution
the others waited breathlessly fi-
nally he set the instrument down care-
fully and turned a drawn face

  its true he breathed impos-
sible but true the rotation of iapetus
has been slowed and-

  he let out a sharp cry and flung a
hand up pointing saturn had risen
above the horizon opposite the sun

  saturn just set groaned shelton
bewildered how can it rise again
and go the opposite way even the
slowing of rotation couldnt account
for that

  no benning croaked it means
that iapetus rotation and revolution
both have changed iapetus has left

its orbit

  traft lunged forward picking up
the sextant he angled saturn and the
sun put the figures down and ran his
finger down the trigonometric scale
fastened above the pilot board

  we have a velocity of a hundred
miles a second relative to saturn with
the sun as a fixed point he announced
the orbital velocity is supposed to
be only two miles a second so iapetus
is streaking out of the orbit at a tan-
gent in the general direction of-
pluto

  the appalling fact was like a living

force

  were on a runaway satellite
shelton summed it up as calmly as he
could but worlds dont just sud-
denly slip out of their orbits after
ages of cutting the same groove obey-
ing the law of gravitation iapetus
has been forced out - by the aliens
this vibration going through the
whole satellite-

  the great machine hugh ben-
ning cried wildly i knew it meant
something unbelievable that great
machine buried deep motivates the
satellite as though it were a space
ship now youll believe me shelton
that they have a miraculous science-
incredible science greater than
ours

  shelton jerked erect i wouldnt
say that he fiercely defended more
developed in one direction perhaps
but not necessarily superior and
theyre not going to get far with this
whatever crazy scheme it leads to
when the ships from rhea arrive-

he stopped his jaw suddenly
dropping

  if they arrive croaked benning
two hours from now theyll arrive
at the point in iapetus orbit where
iapetus used to be theyll look
around dazed and recheck their
course chart they wont find an er-
ror in that theyll look for iapetus
but it will only be a pinpoint star by
then no different from the other
stars

  stop it shouted shelton but he
knew benning was right of course

  shelton knew benning had spoken
the impusyibll wuwld

with inexorable scientific exactness
at their present velocity of  miles
a second they would be three-quarters
of a million miles from where the ships
would arrive at that distance small
iapetus much smaller than earths
moon and three times further away
would be just a bright starlike object
the ships men would have no reason
to single it out as the lost satellite
from all the other bright stars of open
spae

  shelton dived for the radio whats
the matter with me he muttered
cant we tell them what has happened
and where we arc 

  but as soon as he snapped the
switch a sinking feeling came over
him the speaker blared forth with a
confused crackle as though all the
static in the universe had poured into
its coils some powerful interference
was jamming the ether lines

  shelton tried desperately twisting
the rheostat to full power

  iapetus calling the rhea ships
please answer 

  but no answer came no answer
could it seemed worm through that
barrage of interference

  he gave a glad cry suddenly that
as quickly changed to startled disap-
pointment the face of lorg alien
superior blinked into the opti-screen
his voice came through clearly as the
discordant noises became a rustling
background his powerful wave from
so near was able to work through

  you cant signal thqse ships dr
rodney shelton the alien said with
aggravating conviction nor any
ship unless it should happen to pass
within a few dozen miles but no
ships are going to blunder that close
iapetus is lost to the solar system
we are motivating it away by means
of our great machine underground
our scale shows an inch of displace-
ment each second or a rate of a hon-
dred miles a sccond away from saturn
i was not-what is that earth word
-bluffing was i when i said your
planned attack would come too late

  shelton glared at him unable to
speak because of rage frustration and
choking hatred he had never felt
such a burning hate before his fists

clenched till his knuckles were white

  i see you cannot speak the alien
mocked you are too stupefied by
what has occurred and you hate me
it is the hatred of inferior beings for
one superior

  shelton reached to snap the screen
off

  wait the alien superior went
on do not try to leave this moving
satellite in your ships which would be
your next move disaster will follow
if you try there is a stricture of
space a warp surrounding the globe
your ships cannot pass it it would
take far more power than your engines
produce you are prisoners - or
guests you will not be harmed i
have need of you later dr shelton

  the repulsive alien visage glided
out of the screen

chapter xiv
trapped on the runaway world

there was silence within the
etbi- for a moment then
trafts voice boomed out

  its a bluff he scoffed about
not being able to leave

  it may or it may not be shelton
said slowly but i think it has to be
tried its our ony chance to get word
to the system and we dont know
what that devil has up his sleeve the
ranger ship must be used its light-
er-more take-off power power is the
thing needed to judge from lorgs
warning more power than any ship
has

  theres one way to power up a ship
specially at take-off said traft by
resetting the timing of the rockets
and hand-pumping fuel at all the lines
id need-he counted around-every
man here except two

 shelton faced the company hag-
gardly every man except two-to
defy death he said wearily the
first attempt will probably be the only
chance to try it yet it has to be tried
doesnt it

  they all nodded shelton went on
  as for the two men-
  traft interrupted bennings one
hes sick youre the other rod
the big pilot spoke frankly facing his
friend if the ship cracks up youll
at least be left here and youre the
one most qualified to outwit the aliens
in some other way he grinned
wryly its a sort of devil-and-tbe-
deep choice its even-steven either
way rod

  shelton saw the logic of that though
at first it seemed he was being asked
to shirk taking his chances

  all right he said gruffly

  it was no time for heroics though
solomon himself would not have been
able to say which was the most heroic
choice

  traft as pilot took charge order-
ing the men into vac-suits after sol-
emn farewells they trudged to the
ranger ship

  shelton myra benning and her
brother alone in the etbi-
watched from the pilots cupola after
half an hour while the ranger ships
engine had been idling and the men
instructed trafts big cheery face ap-
peared in the opti-screen behind the
visor of his vac-suit

  all set he said

  shelton had thought of a hundred
things he wanted to say to his friend
at this final chilling moment which
might be their last together but
something choked him

  good luck old man was all he
could bring out in a dry hoarse voice

  watch me ram through that
damned warj of his promised the
big pilot waving nonchalantly as
though departing on a pleasure cruise
but they could see the set grimness
behind his wide grin

  he stared at shelton oddly for a
moment then

  you know where my camera is
rod he said softly its yours-in
case

  shelton nodded blankly it was the
big pilots way of acknowledging the
moment

  his image flickered out

  shelton watched tensely it was
their last chance now to get word to
the rhea ships so that the runaway
satellite could be traced if this

failed lorg and his aliens would have
escaped entirely free to carry on their
plans whatever they were the ran-
ger ship must get through that threat-
ened invisible barrier simply must

the long sleek ship out there
trembled long tongues of sear-
ing flame shot from its underside it
catapulted up suddenly into the sun-
shine like a roaring monster rock-
ets blasted away at the rear to give it
a forward momentum and thus tear
away from iapetus gravity at a tan-
gent gathering speed swiftly it
launched itself into the sky

  shelton held his breath where
would the mysterious warp mani-
fest itself what was it what
would it do

  dr shelton tried to quiet his grow-
ing horror traft was at the controls
big powerful indomitable traft with
the strength of a bull and the cunning
skill of piloting in the spaceways he
would win through

  the sleek ranger ship hurtled up-
ward driven by powerful blasts sel-
dom used in take-offs against an un-
known force traft was pitting every
ounce of ramming power the ship had
split seconds passed with the drawn-
out beat of hours

  a gasp of horror was wrung from
the lips of the three watchers in the
etbi- the ranger ship drilling
into the sky nose foremost stopped
almost abruptly a thousand yards
above as though it had struck a wall
of steel the nose flattened and bent
shiveringly the rest of the long tor-
pedo hull telescoped upon itself with
a terrific grinding noise that even the
thin air of iapetus carried as a grating
thunder

  shelton stared with fixed eyes that
refused to turn away the wreck
dropped like a stone a broken twisted
thing without semblance to the ship
it had been a second before it crashed
n jagged rocks and fell apart as
though it were a rotten apple nausea
twisted sheltons stomach

  one soul-torn shriek escaped myra
bennings lips those men she
cried looking down at the destroyed
ship

vv

  no use hoping for them muttered
shelton with an infinite ache in his
whole body

  his very soul shook at thought of
bodies ground to quivering bloody
shreds their lives snuffed out like
snapping strings

  dead every one of them he said
tonelessly

  i think youre wrong said hugh
benning something is moving near
the wreck-by that red rock thrown
clear

stumbling pilot back

  inside again trafts suit was
stripped off and he was laid on a bunk
for a uunute he lay with closed eyes
breathing heavily finally he opened
his eyes-and grinned

  here i am he whispered weakly
cant kill me off so easy

  shelton shook his head youre
alive though you shouldnt be the
pilots cupola cracked into it first
you should have been ground to a
powder

  shelton let out a startled yelp its
traft

  it was unmistakably a giant figure
in a vac-suit was crawling to its feet
a dozen yards from the shapeless mess
of the wreckage it rose stagger-
ingly helmet twisting as though to
locate the etbi- then reeled to-
ward them

  shelton was in his own vac-suit
and was out in less time than he had
ever taken before he sped across the
intervening distances helped the

  traft sat up vitality once again
flowing through his veins

  call it a miracle lie said simply
ail i know is the universe cracked
open and i fell through the grim
reaper just didnt call my number
though-his eyes went bleak-he
reaped plenty his fists clenched
damn that lorg he snarled if
there ever was a fiend-

  a scientific fiend put in hugh
benning hopelessly with super-
science at his command were
trapped now completely

one of them could deny that

      shelton realized that the big
heavy etbi- undermanned could
nevr leave if the ranger ship
couldnt their radio signals were
blocked not a thing more could be
done it was simply a matter of rid-
ing away with the moving satellite
away from saturn away from the
sun out to the-unknown

  it was a terrifying feeling like
sinking to the bottomless depths of
a dark ocean already huge saturn
had dwindled to a tiny moon with a
bright ring around it the suns light
grew steadily fainter what breath-
less velocity was taking them from
the empire of man receding behind
them

  lets check our velocity sug-
gested shelton

  traft in the pilots cupola angled
the sun saturn and a fixed star

  five thousand miles a second he
said at last incredulously iapetus
has been accelerating constantly all
this time

  shelton tried to think of the ti-
tanic powers necessary to accelerate
this great bulk millions of times
larger and heavier than earths
hughest freighter but stopped in dis-
may it was as benning had said
super-science

  the radio signal blinked in his eyes
lorg i suppose he muttered snap-
ping the stud

  the alien superiors reptilian fea-
tures shone in the screen

  are you convinced br rodney
shelton he spoke austerely i
watched the crash of your other ship
with an optical instrument of mine
that pierces matter it was a futile
attempt the warp is impenetrable

i warned you but you disbelieve-
at the cost of ten lives

  nine damn you-only nine shel-
ton yelled back taking a small twist-
ed pleasure in that denial one lived
but youll pay for those other lives
a few rives scoffed the alien
what of the lives of my people that
you and your men took but i do not
hold it against you there is much

more at stake than a few lives his
eyes glistened planets worlds are
the prizes i want

  you will not find it so easy shel-
ton grimly retorted you will have
to war against all our forces you
will never win

  the torm leader smiled cryptically
indomitable spirit he mused
murv is right in that he raised his
voice  am busy i will contact you
later you understand fully now that
you are my-guests

  with a mocking glance his image
vanished from the screen

  shelton writhed internally help-
less captives in the hands of a ruthless
intelligence yet it was not that so
much his personal welfare was un-
important it was the thought of not
being able to warn earth

  he tried the radio again full power
calling out a time-honored sos for
attention but there was only a con-
tinuous niagara of howling static
through which no wave could work
in desperation he tried every conceiv-
able wave-band everywhere the
drowning static   

  no wait his pulses leaped at
micro-wave nine the hiss of a strong
carrier-wave came through micro-
wave nine-the space scientist he
must be near near enough to batter
through-and perhaps trying to make
contact

hopefully shelton tuned the
vernier and let out a triumphant
cry a the space scientists masked
head ghosted into the screen

  space scientist he cried eagerly
shelton calling-dr rodney shel-
ton 

  apparently startled the space sci-
entist seemed to be staring speechless
for the moment then he said

  dr shelton you-

  listen to me shelton hurriedly
burst in im caught on iapetus
cant leave or radio earth there are
aliens here somehow motivating iape-
tus they threaten war on the em-
pire-want planets cant explain
more now youre last hope you
must radio rhea ships to follow
hurry lorg might hear-send ships
after you

  the globed head shook i do not
take commands from you dr shel-
ton  he declared frigidly i am not
concerned with the empires affairs
shelton choked was the man still
playing his childish part in the face
of this

  but this is something vital he
roared something bigger than your
paltry ideas of isolation and indepen-
dence the empire is in danger
cant you understand  suddenly re-
membering sheltons face grew livid
you knew of this before you
warned me not to come to iapetus
you knew of the aliens but you
would not tell me you would not
warn earth unless-he ground his
words out vehemently glaring with
fierce accusation at the space scien-
tist-you have renounced all claim
to your human birth youll inform the
rhea ships-redeem yourself to that
extent at least

  no the word came flatly
man you cant calmly stand by
cried shelton aghast when the
least little word from you-

  enough snapped the space sci-
entist emotions do not move me
iapetus and the aliens are an interest-
ing problem to me and to my theory
-no more their relation to the em-
pire of earth is irrelevant

  but you were trying to contact
me groaned shelton why to
taunt me you-

  at that moment on the screen a
second view superimposed itself over
the space scientist the latters fig-
ure vanished instantly lorgs feat-
ures suspicious stared out of shel-
tons opti-screen

  to whom were you talking the
alien demanded

  none of your business retorted
shelton snapping off

  shelton turned away from the radio
with sagging shoulders

that was our last hope he mut-
tered bitterly and it had to hang
on the mad ego of a monomaniac
hes inhuman myra whispered
a man who thinks himself a god
hes lower than the aliens

snapped traft i just wish i had
him here for one minute id change
his mind about some things
shelton shrugged he looked out
at receding saturn now scarcely dis-
playing a disk

  too late now lorg and his torms
have succeeded in stealing a whole sa-
tellite from under the empires nose
all we can do now is wait and see
what develops he sighed and went
on in a monotone as far as we our-

       chapter xv 
       outward to pluto

eight hours later saturn had
taken its place in the starry back-
drop of space as another of the pin-
point host the sun had dimmed
and shrunk proportionately traft
hoarsely had announced their veloc-
ity as twenty thousand miles a sec-
ond 

  four humans riding a runaway sa-
tellite at a prodigious velocity that
could barely be matched by earths
fastest and lightest ships fantastic
dream an entire world whose mass
measured a staggering total of earthly
tons hurtling away from its age-old
orbit like a gigantic cannon-ball the
erigine to drive it must produce forces
comparable to the smoldering giant
that at times on earth had laid waste
its crust colossal power was in
play whose designation in horse-
power would require reams of paper
to record

  shelton had fallen into a sort of
shock-proof calm facts had to be ac-
cepted now that the initial excite-
ment had died down he began ponder-
ing why had this been done an
entire satellite ripped from its orbit
flung toward the outer reaches their
destination was pluto obviously
bo

what was to be done there what
were lorgs cryptic plans

  shelton tried to anticipate a little
but made no headway so far it was
inexplicable

the radio signal flashed shelton
knew it would be lorg the alien
superior his hatefully confident
features peered out of the screen his
large unlidded eyes aglow

  a complete success lorg chor-
tled in triumph the great machine
which drives this satellite has come
up to all our expectations we worked
on it many years it would have been
a sad blow if it had failed but our
engineers and scientists performed
nobly you have perhaps noticed dr
shelton that we have achieved the
velocity of twenty thousand miles a
second i think you will agree with
me that it is a marvelous feat-a prod-
uct of super-science

  shelton remained stonily silent

  but let me show you this great
machine of which i am so proud
lorg went on imperturbably i will
relay views of it through to you just
one moment

  shelton almost snapped off the opti-
screen enraged at the torms smug
boastfulness but then he stayed his
hand it might be well to know as
much of the aliens doings as possible

  the alien superiors face was re-
placed in the screen by another pic-
ture it was meaningless at first a
jumble but suddenly its perspective
leaped out as finer tuning smoothed
the general haziness

  shelton gulped as the impression of
great depth smote him it was an
aerial view of a cyclopean chamber
the walls were studded with little
boxes-no big transparent boxes in
each of which sat an alien they were
manipulating controls strange beams
stabbed outward toward the thing in
the center

  and the thing in the center was a
truly amazing object-a gigantic coil
of glasslike material uprearing from
floor to ceiling it surrounded a thin-
ner coil that in turn surrounded nar-
rower coils dozens of them finally
the core was a thick laminated post

that lost itself in the screen evidently
piercing the roof and continuing

  it was hard to estimate dimensions
shelton conservatively placed the
largest outside coil as a thousand feet
long and at least a hundred wide its
glasslike glistening cable was perhaps
five feet thick but there was no sign
of a support the thing upheld its
own tremendous weight earths best
steel would never do that as a coil

  a purling violet glow surrounded
the coils deepening toward the core
electrical power in one form or an-
other but shelton was certain look
as he might that there wasnt a pin-
head of metal in the place plastics
that must be the only answer

  lorgs voice came as though he
were a commentator lecturing tour-
ists

  the great machine he informed
from its coils springs the world-
moving force that motivates iapetus
it is simple electricity is fed through
the coil matrix and transformed there-
by into space-warping energy when
space is warped gravitational forces
arise i believe your scientist ein-
stein postulated that a century ago
the alien nodded slightly as though
giving unvoiced commendation to
einstein he went on

  we warp space in the direction
opposite that in which we wish to go
a negative gravitational field results
repelling the gravity of iapetus ia-
petus moves since space is fixed it
is that warp beyond which your radio
calls cannot penetrate and that your
ranger ship so unfortunately crashed
into it is a solid wall of bent space
shelton was thunderstruck but to
control himself he asked

 how do you produce the great
amount of electricity needed

 the alien smiled we need but
little electricity we have taken ad-
vantage of a simple fact the lower
the temperature of u conductor the
less resistance to the flow of electri-
city the electron move more easily
as some of your earth scientists
know a slight current in a coil of wire
near absolute zero will continue for
hours even days without diminish-
ing
the impossible world



  at the absolute zero itself the cur-
rent would continue forever this
chamber is enclosed artificially
cooled and is as close to absolute ero
as we can achieve perhaps it is a few
millionths of a degree above my
workers there are in sealed suits we
have only to feed in tiny amounts of
electricity now and then to make up
for small losses but the original
current put in is still there circuiting
endlessly producing the great world-
moving forces for us like a faithful
undying slave

  the earth people stared at the great
coils trying to understand a pulsat-
ing current rippled silently through
never dying never wearing out

  its impossible shelton found
himself muttering absolutely im-
possible

 then we do the impossible-in
your conception the alien said
pointedly notice the coils them-
selves they are not metal they are
of plastic composition it is also true
that poor conductors become good
conductors at low temperatures we
are masters of low temperature meth-
ods earthman and of plastics

  our life our environment exists
at much lower temperatures than
yours we know little of heat meth-
ods therefore we have never been
able to utilize metals furnaces and
all those processes that are the life of
your civilization

  the picture of the great machine
had flicked away and lorgs face once
again greeted them

  we do not use explosives guns
since we have no metal industry he
went on instead of rocket ships we
have gravity ships whose engines are
miniatures of the great machine we
have developed plastics to serve all
our needs we have a greater number
of varieties serving all purposes than
you have alloys thus you see we are
not handicapped we handle greater
powers in fact than you as you have
just seen our civilization and science
will prove themselves superior-in the
coming events

  shelton felt suddenly chilled what
would those coming events be that
question stabbed through his mind

crowding out the amazing super-
science he had glimpsed

  you are taking iapetus to pluto
he stated as a feeler for what pur-
pose is pluto your home world
why-

  he stared quizzically at lorg wait-
ing

  the alien superior smiled enigmat-
ically you will find out all those
things in due time he said non-com-
mittally we will reach pluto in
thirty-six hours i suggest - he
glanced mockingly from one to an-
other of their haggard faces - that
you get some sleep you cannot es-
cape and you are safe incidentally
heres a little bedtime entertainment
for you relayed from a ship just be-
yond the warp

  the loud speaker crackled for a mo-
ment then blared forth with an ex-
cited earth commentators voice the
earth people leaned forward tensely

  -that utterly vanished a few hours
ago this eighth moon of saturn has
apparently slipped out of its orbit in-
credible as it sounds and lost itself
earth astronomers are searching fe-
verishly with their telescopes but so
far it has not been located the titan
ranger patrol has been out searching
through and around saturn without
result iapetus is gone

  no one knows how it happened
astronomers say it is impossible for
a moon to wander off no official
statement has been issued yet by the
government something startling will
probably be the answer but official
channels have not revealed a thing
all official posts at titan and rhea
are under a seal of silence it is hoped
that wayward iapetus will soon be
found somewhere around saturn and
thus end this unprecedented mystery
this is the central-

  the voice was clipped off with
his mocking leer lorg said au re-
voir and his image faded

  theyre looking around saturn
said shelton bitterly were past the
orbit of uranus already if only some-
body knew before-

 before what queried traft
what do you figure the aliens are
going to do when weve reached plu-


startling stories

to

  shelton shook his head lets get
some sleep he said

   lying in his bunk a little later he
thought of iapetus at pluto being
loaded like a bomb with ships and
aliens a movable war base it could
rumble into the solar system disgorg-
ing its fighting forces anywhere
needed he could almost picture the
scene a moon looming in one of the
planets skies ships plunging down to
attack earthly forces taken unawares

  was this what lorg planned shel-
tons sleep was troubled by the tailings
of these ominous conjectures

chapter xvi

impossible world

day had become permanent on
their side of iapetus since the
anti-gravity force was projected back-
ward from their position on the sat-
ellite it was a queer sky they saw
stationary immovable with the plan-
ets and sun slowly fading

  the bright dot of earth had drawn
in so close to the sun as its orbit
shrank that it was obscured they
could not see pluto with the bulk of
the satellite between but they knew
it must be getting bright expanding
into a disk

  the party aboard the grounded ex-
pedition snip had slept or tried to
for a few hours since then they had
waited in an air of portentous gloom
eating a little as the hours passed
finally they felt an increased throb-
bing under their feet as the satellite
quivered with decelerating forces
thair weight became noticeably
greater as inertia pressed them
groundward

  we must be arriving at pluto
traft surmised slowing down now
well they did it

  sheltqji nodded reluctantly he
was forcfed to admire the achievement
if not the achievers a tremendous
world-sized bulk driven by namelessly
supreme energies across three billion
miles of space never in the annals

of earth science had such a thing
been dreamed possible the aliens
had touched a height in this direc-
tion at least it was something to be
respected

   after awhile the pressure vanished
and subtly they felt a new motion that
iapetus had taken

  were revolving around pluto
predicted hugh benning

  and rotating added traft indi-
cating the stars which had begun to
wheel up from one horizon and down
the opposite

   shelton dashed for the radio

  maybe theyve turned the warp
off

  but the roaring static greeted him
as before lorg was not making any
slips

  presently in their sky a dark
shrouded bulk shouldered up between
two peaks at the east it rose like
a brooding monster barely lighter
than the black void behind it lit by
a starlike sun four billion miles away

  pluto breathed myra benning
catching her breath not many hu-
mans had seen the outermost planet
of the solar system so close she
turned to shelton theyve made ia-
petus a moon of pluto at present is
that what the aliens plans amounted
to perhaps lorg was just talking
without meaning the restj

  i wish i could think sof murmured
shelton

  he stared up at the dark planet
somewhat larger than earth it was
too far to see but was the toma civili-
zation up there on that bitter surface
were there dozens perhaps hundreds
of cities built of plastics unwarned
unlighted save dimly the natural
homes of the cold-blooded reptilian
aliens who had come to take iapetus
away and more important were
there fleets of warships there with
highly developed cold force projec-
tors ready to be transported toward
the sun to swarm into the solar sys-
tem

   shelton waited to see in a fever of
anxious impatience

  nothing seemed to happen the
skies continued to revolve overhead
for several hours pluto swung around
majestically with the stars and finally
sank again as broodingly as it had
arisen

  but not long after the empty fir-
mament slowed down and locked into
place they all tensed suddenly as the
steady underground vibrations slowly
increased

soon the throbbing became so vio-
lent that objects in the ship rat-
tled against the metal walls even the
teeth of the waiting four clicked and
their shoes beat a tattoo against the
floor outside the landscape seemed
to dance the stars became darting
fireflies whirling in small circles as
their vision stuttered

  g-gr-eat j-jup-pi-ter  exclaimed
traft is ia-pet-tus-s fl-y-ying
ap-part

  it almost seemed that way plainly
some inconceivable force was being
spawned within iapetus even greater
than the energies that had driven it
from saturn for one panic-stricken
moment the thought came that perhaps
the great machine had been strained
beyond its limit was now breaking
down to unleash its pent-up torrent
of energy in one space-shattering ex-
plosion

  each of the four waiting breath-
lessly felt as if sitting on top of a
volcano

  but gradually the nerve-jangling vi-
bration smoothed out into a steadier
though still powerful rhythm it felt
now like the humming beat of a gar-
gantuan diesel motor the stars
ceased their dizzying motion yet the
four earth people sensed that the
great machine below was laboring
harder than it had before hope
roused in shelton that the machine
had partially broken down or was at
least weakened a machine constantly
in need of repairs would hinder the
aliens considerably

  they fell to waiting again without
knowing for what they were waiting
after an hour trafton stared fixedly
at the stars then jumped to his space
sextant he looked up after taking
tentative readings

  thats queer he observed were
going past plutos position but in a

straight line weve left the orbit

  they crowded at the east port
waiting for pluto to appear the wait
grew to an hour-and the dark brood-
ing planet had not risen as it should
if they were going past it in what
crazy direction were they going and
where was pluto

  suspense charged the air with no
one daring to speak

 at last hugh benning broke the
taut silence with a long sibilant
breath the lines of his face deepened
perceptibly as he spoke

  pluto isnt there he said almost
inaudibly pluto has been moved
from its orbit

  for a mad moment shelton almost
felt like forcing benning to take back
those incredible words it just
couldnt be it was one thing to move
a comparatively tiny body like iapetus
- dumfounding as that had been
awhile before--but moving pluto a
definite planet a hundred times larger
and more massive    how could
one accept such a palpable impossibil-
ity 

  shelton kept staring out of the port
telling himself that with their motion
phito must eventually appear reced-
ing he turned finally in hopeless
dismay it fit in of course with the
increased beat of the great machine
somehow the titanic gravitational
forces had been made to drag the big
planet from its orbit

accepting that his stunned
mind tackled the looming enig-
ma of why and where

  mark he commanded the pilot
find out where-in what general di-
rection-were going

  traft nodded and raced for the pi-
lots cupola it would be a rather
delicate measurement with the basing
planets so dim

  shelton eyed the sun gauge its
measurement of the strength of sun-
light was a rough scale by which to
judge advance to or recession from
the sun the needle was going down
shelton refused to think what that
meant until traft came down again

  were receding directly from the
sun he reported with false calmness
the velocity is already about a thou-
sand miles a second

  shelton met the shock of this rev-
elation with a savage curse myra
benning put a hand to her throat and
froze in that attitude hugh benning
bobbed his head with a queer twisted
smile on his face traft kneaded one
hand in the other aimlessly

  that was where stupefying as it
was but now why shelton finally
ran to the radio the others following
as though afraid to be alone

  shelton calling lorg he barked
into the microphone determined to
swallow his pride and ask pointblank
questions

  there was some delay but finally
the alien superiors visage rounded
into the opti-screen

  i am very busy at present he
snapped my attention is needed
with the moving of pluto what do
you want

  youre moving pluto away from
the sun shelton snapped back
why and exactly where

  i told you i wanted planets re-
torted the alien i am bringing pluto
to my home world

  sheltons sharp gasp was explosive
shock piled on shock

 your home world he echoed
weakly out there he waved a
hand vaguely toward the regions be-
yond plutos former orbit do you
mean theres a tenth planet out this
way it has never been detected by
earth astronomers

  no there is no tenth planet in-
formed the alien without elaborating
he seemed to be enjoying their sur-
prise

  then where is your home world
demanded shelton the nearest star
would take years to reach even at
your best speeds your home world
cant be out there it - its impos-
sible 

  you like that word impossible
lorg grinned and shrugged well
then my world is the impossible
world but its out there ill contact
you later-and explain

  shelton snapped the radio stud with
such force that his fingers were
bruised

 am i going crazy he half
moaned he looked wildly at the
others tell me where do we find
worlds planets around suns of
course and where are the suns
the nearest is four light-years away
and he talks of an impossible world
his home world out there planets
dont fly around free in space theyre
formed from suns bound to suns
it-

  he broke off realizing he had let
go of his nerves sorry he mut-
tered doesnt help any to blow up
ill have to follow my own advice-
to accept facts were moving away
from the sun and to lorgs alleged
home world thats that

blank-faced dazed they
gazed out toward the sun their
sun dimming perceptibly back of
them the events of the past day had
blunted their minds a satellite
yanked out of its eon-long orbit mo-
tivated to pluto like a great ship
pluto tugged out of its orbit and now
being pushed out into the abyss of
outer space it was more than the
mind of man had ever before been
called upon to witness and accept

  they ate mechanically then dis-
covered they had been awake for
many hours wearily they slept

 when they awoke they hardly
dared look out of the ports but an
unwilling fascination drew them
the sight stabbed every nerve with
icy needles around them was the
true chasm of the empty void chill-
ing abysmal the sun had been rele-
gated to the rank of a true star
though an exceedingly bright one
even at plutos orbit sunlight was of
the intensity of five hundred full
moons on earth but here the suns
beams had become starlight feebler
than jupiters smallest moon

  there was a terrifying grandeur to
the scene theirb were perhaps the
first earthly eyes to look back at the
solar system from such a remote
viewpoint

  trafts camera clicked recording
the bizarre perspective on micro-film
most of the planets were invisible
one with the sun jupiter could be
hi impoaslhll world

 t

distinguished a slight distance out
and saturn uranus and neptune like
tiny pinpricks in the black fabric of
space

  but where was pluto it should be
visible too shelton started remem-
bering pluto wasnt there where it
should be it was being towed away
out into the sunless void but where
to what impossible destination

  finally the anxiously awaited call
came from the alien superior who
alone could tell the answers to the
plaguing question

  you still think it is impossible for
my home world to be out here some-
where lorg inquired amusedly

  planets come with suns shelton
doggedly insisted the nearest star
in this direction is sirius almost nine
light-years away something clicked
in his mind something about sirius
a dark sun-thats the only possibil-
ity he finished with a sharp quiv-
ering breath

  lorg preparing to throw this
bombshell looked almost angered
that shelton had guessed the answers

  yes he nodded there are dark
suns as well as bright ones suns that
have burned out or dimmed to a low
red heat your astronomers do not
know how many of such invisible
dead suns exist between and among
the burning stars such a dark sun
would be undetectable by your earthly
telescopes unsuspected that is my
home world-a dark sun compara-
tively close to your bright sun with
one planet

  a dark sun out in the great gulf
between sol and its surrounding
stars a more staggering conception
could hardly be advanced yet in a
way it was almost a simple answer

hhere is this dark sun he
w w jerked out how far

  about ten billion miles out from
plutos orbit stated lorg there-
fore about fifteen billion miles from
the sun it is in fact a companion
star to the sun-a dark companion
they form a binary revolving about
a common center of gravity many
stars have dark companions even
your scientists know that sirius for

instance and it is likely that the
sirians if the star has inhabitants do
not know of their companion dark
sun just as you earthlings have not
suspected

 a binary-our sun murmured
shelton finding it a queer thought
but their motion around a common
center    shouldnt that be detect-
able to our astronomers in the posi-
tions of the stars

  not unless parallax measurements
were taken over the appropriate
eighty-year period lorg seemed to
sneer your stargazers missed that
and they missed a still bigger clue-
the extremely eccentric orbit of plu-
to which at one point crossed nep-
tunes they kept looking for a myth-
ical tenth planet why could they
not conceive of a dead but gigantic
sun exerting its gravitational influ-
ence scarcely much further how-
ever that clue is gone now-plutos
orbit

  there was satisfied maliciousness in
the aliens tones

  shelton saw it with breath-taking
clarity now the pieces of the mad
jig-saw puzzle were falling together
rationally

  and you are taking pluto to your
sun he said to be one of your plan-
ets

 lorg nodded our sun has only
the one natural planet we torms
are a growing ambitious race we
need worlds in which to expand
what better than to take them from
our neighboring system which has
them to spare

  the earth people could only stare
hearing the diabolic world-stealing
plan of the aliens laid bare lorg
and his people were thieves out of the
void come to loot the solar system
of its planets the realization was
staggering

  lorg raised a hand at the storm of
outraged protest that was ready to
burst from his listeners

  let me tell the whole story brief-
ly he said

 he settled back in his seat as
though to enjoy the exposition of
these mind-staggering things that
would amaze his audience


chapter xvii
world of the dark sun

wwillions of years ago lorg
mw began with a grand flourish
a double star a binary plunged at
sol then a single star without plan-
ets as your lyttleton theory states
in part one of these suns grazed sol
so that it ejected a mass of its burning
material the attraction of the other
sun drew this out into a long tongue
that finally split into fragments-
molten balls becoming the planets

  this second sun then careened on
into space as our cosmogenists have
reconstructed that cosmic tryst but
its companion was torn from its bin-
ary attraction because after the col-
lision the first suns velocity had been
reduced this sun then became sols
double retreating to fifteen billion
miles in passing the molten planets
it clutched the last one for itself be-
coming our lone planet torm we
call our sun tor

  lorg paused and made a motion as
though sweeping billions of years
aside then resumed

  so much for that in due time life
appeared on torm when it had
cooled warm life such as yours for
tor was then a hot sun intelligence
evolved in close to human form evo-
lution is repetitious because of the
analogous mutation through the con-
stant cosmic-rays

  but then-his voice softened a
little-tor an older sun than sol be-
gan to cool a struggling civilization
fought against increasing darkness
and cold losing intelligence was
eclipsed on torm for ages but na-
ture is resourceful mutation finally
produced a cold-blooded species in-
ured to the dark life-our present spe-
cies i

the alien superiors eyes glowed

  the latent spark of intellect burst
into flame again at about this time
in sols system intelligence arose
again on earth the first uprise on
mars had passed into decadence
thus our two civilizations torm and

earth grew up almost side by side
yours much like our ancient warm-
age one with metals and heat indus-
tries ours today a cold-age one
with plastics and low temperature
methods

  your civilization had not sus-
pected ours for you could not see our
dark sun but we saw your blazing
proximity from the first when we
had conquered gravity and sent space
ships to explore the solar system we
frankly envied your big family of
planets where we had only one the
thought germinated grew blos-
somed-

  lorgs lips twisted significantly
then he continued on a different tack

  we sent colonists to pluto nep-
tune and uranus but we could not
go any closer to the sun with its ter-
rific heat-not until we found the
great natural hollows within iapetus
we established a colony there that
was a century ago at just the time you
earth people initiated interplanetary
travel

  lorgs voice rose on a more vital
note at this time i became the
superior of all our colonizing activi-
ties yes i am more than a hundred
years old we are long-lived as are
all cold-blooded creatures i foretold
seeing your empire-building that
eventually there would be friction be-
tween our races when you reached
uranus and outward you would
claim those planets establish juris-
diction over our colonies and we
would be no better off than before

org straightened importantly

  i laid plans before the rulers
of torm work was begun installing
the great machine within iapetus it
took us a century-a hundred years of
driving scientific research hard labor
sacrifice and danger i saw that at the
end it would be a race against your
earthly expansion before you had too
firm a grip on the planets we wanted
particularly-the alien looked hard
at shelton- vith the application of
your admirable bio-conditioning
process we must get the planets
away quickly we decided

  the earth people were listening in
the impossible world

t

a taut silence was this all a mad
impossible dream that all these tre-
mendous unsuspected events had
been going on building up to a crash-
ing climax for a century shelton
shook his head remembering the fa-
mous soliloquy there are more
things in heaven-

  the alien wont on dovetailing the
more recent occurrences

  i had hoped not to have our pres-
ence in your system discovered until
the great machine had been com-
pleted some of your exploration
ships landing on the outer planets
where our colonies existed were-
eliminated we did not fear discov-
ery on iapetus being underground
but quite by accident recently the
survey ship of which you know
landed next to one of our cave en-
trances the men peered in star-
tled my guards there blunderingly
used the cold force

 lorg looked at traft and ben-
ning later when that giant man
there shone his flashlight looking for
the small man my guard fled taking
the man you call benning along
hearing of this i knew there would
be investigation work was rushed
on the great machine only a few
more days and it would be ready 

  he looked at shelton you came
into the picture dr rodney shelton
from what i know of earthly affairs
your ship approaching saturn
spelled investigation on iapetus i
sent a ship to attack to put you into
suspended animation and bring you
here as prisoners but the ranger
ship intervened events seemed about
to get out of hand for me

  i decided not to attack you on the
surface of iapetus with our ships for
fear you would radio for help imme-
diately instead i planned a trap
you fell into it were captured your
later clever escape and message to
earth of our presence came perilously
close to upsetting my plans but not
quite-by a margin of only hours

  lorg finished gloatingly the
rest you know our hundred-year
plan for which we have labored with
fanatic zeal approaches its fulfilment
torm will have sister planets and our

race will expand

  shelton had been standing rigidly
listening with every fiber of his being
to the amazing recital but it was no
time now for squirrel-cage rumina-
tions one burning thought usurped
his brain find out all you can
every little item of information
would be useful in the looming clash
between earth and torm forces

  how many planets he asked de-
liberately do you plan to take as
youve taken pluto

  and suddenly he remembered the
arbitration episode back at saturn
lorg had asked for five planets and all
their moons and threatened to take
them by force if balked now shel-
ton knew lorg had meant that liter-
ally

  lorg smiled arrogantly we
discuss that later he said abruptly
his alien scale-covered features
flicked from the screen

on and on into the dim void sped
the powered satellite pushing
stolen pluto in the tongs of artificial
gravity before it

  already oppressed by the knowl-
edge of the alien menace the earth
people were still more crushed in
spirit by the dark sunless caldron of
outer space around them the solar
system seemed lost the sun was
now a distinctly yellow tar almost
unthinkably remote

  but shelton did not let mental leth-
argy destroy all initiative he drove
traft and benning to plotting the
exact direction of their flight in re-
lation to the fixed stars long hours
of tedious work gave result shelton
smiled grimly the direction of tor
the alien sun was known in case
earthly forces should wing out here

  six earth days passed after the de-
parture from what had been plutos
orbit as the ten-billion-mile gap was
negotiated at the prodigious velocity
of twenty thousand miles a second
lorgs guests slept ate and in-
spected their oxygen units regularly
carrying on the details of life while
their brains were torture chambers

  at last far out in the hollow im-
mensity of space deceleration was


startling stories

felt it pressed them for hours as the
great machine groaningly dragged at
their plunging speed sudden quake-
like vibrations arose and died and
their motion veered

  putting pluto in an orbit around
tor observed traft

  they waited anxiously to see tor
the sister sun of sol it rose slowly
above their horizon a giant redly
glowing globe whose atomic fires had
long since burned low for reasons that
the cosmos only knew its surface
temperature could not be much more
than that of heated iron perhaps a
few hundred degrees centigrade its
rays were too feeble to reach across
the void and register in earthly tele-
scopes it would be a corpse sun
truly dark and dead in another mil-
lion-year tick of the cosmic clock

  its ruddy radiance cast a ghastly
glow over the landscape of iapetus
paler than moonlight the earth
people shuddered under that alien
luminescence a more unearthlike
setting could not be imagined

  caught in a spell traft almost for-
got to snap pictures but finally did
with his camera lenses open to their
full light-gathering power for the
darksome scenes he hoped the weird
colors would come up

  a full earth day was taken up in
maneuvering pluto into an orbit
around tor the great machines
song of vibration changed pitch
hourly as greater and lesser forces
were brought into play it was fan-
tastic this manipulation of heavenly
orbs

  they could feel a sudden surge as
iapetus finally ungripped its plane-
tary burden soon pluto was seen
receding slowly rotating following
its given orbit tor was its primary
now and its dark surface was lit som-
berly by the dull torshine a planet
that had circled the sun for ages on
end had been transplanted to a new
part of the universe

  it grated against sheltons every
instinct the whole thing wasnt
right a violation of the design of
space

  then iapetus picked up speed and
raced inward toward the dark sun a

planet appeared perhaps as large as
saturn gloomy and shadow-haunted
torm the home world of the aliens
who had come marauding to the solar
system

iapetus lowered until it must
loom in torms sky as a huge
moon it halted there for some rea-
son

  shelton tuned the radio and finally
an opti-screen view appeared of mill-
ing crowds of aliens within a city
square thousands upon thousands
were there cheering and waving hys-
terically their combined voices
thundered from the speaker they
were cheering lorg who had brought
them the first of new worlds

  shelton started suddenly listening
the warp must be off if radio waves
came through but even as he turned
to remind the others lorgs face
blotted out the other scene

  we are hovering above torm my
home world he said for the pres-
ent the warp is not in operation but
do not try foolhardy escape you will
note that several of my ships hover
over you if you try to leave the
warp will be immediately turned on
you would not like to crash like the
ranger ship

  the alien face mocking flicked
from the opti-screen

  shelton looked out of the port
above hovered a half dozen black
ships silent sentinels it would be
madness to attempt a dash for free-
dom

  ceremonies went on endlessly for a
day black gravity ships plastic-
hulled shot back and forth a scene
showed lorg high on a balcony
bathed in torshine addressing the
mad crowds

  periodically they cheered it was
a scene that might have been recorded
anywhere on earth with the return
of a conquering hero lorg was the
great man of the hour to the torms
an explorer who with no new lands
to discover had brought back a land
fetched it from the heavens

 hes having his moment now
growled traft but just wait

 tense worry gripped shelton
the impossible world



what were lorgs plans in regard to
them were they to be incarcerated
in torm in some earth-conditioned
prison shelton knew that lorg
wanted something with him for he
had hinted it and in sheltons mind
was horrible suspicion

  even as the earth people helplessly
waited down in the torm city lorg
faced murv in a private chamber
outside the ovations of the crowd
over lorgs speech could still be
heard

  the two aliens eyed one another
faintly hostile

  you have made bold hints lorg
in your speech said murv hints
that you would not only bring back
more planets but defy the earthmen
entirely i warn you against such a
dangerous course lorg you must
arbitrate with earth lest we earn bit-
ter enemies for all time it may be
too late already though i think they
will condone the taking of pluto but
you must arbitrate with them now or
you will plunge our two worlds into
a war of practical extermination on
one side or the other

  yes yes of course i will arbi-
trate assured lorg averting his
eyes am i not taking the dr rod-
ney shelton back with me for that
purpose

  satisfied murv turned away lorg
watched him with a twisted smile

chapter xviii

solar menace

all the torm celebrations over
the great event done with iape-
tus leaped away back the way it had
come the great red sun tor began
to fade behind as the course was set
for sol

  the earth people felt instant re-
lief their hearts gladened at the
mere thought of returning-home
the utterly alien world in which they
had been stifled their senses frayed
their nerves they watched as the
dim bulk of tor dark sun of the
aliens dwindled into the midnight of

space

  only a short while later traft sud-
denly let out sharp cry

  look he pointed out of the port
the space scientists ship what
in thunder is he doing here

  shelton saw the large torpedo-
shaped ship with two white crosses on
its sides it scudded over above the
warp blocking out the stars and
darted for open space

  shelton started for the radio then
stopped and groaned

  whats the use he murmured
he doesnt care about us or the em-
pire hes probably here only to ob-
serve like a aloof god somehow he
followed all the way from the system
but only to fit all this into his mad
theory whatever it is its ironic
that he alone should be able to warn
the empire-and wont

  time seemed to stand slill in the
star-powered void their hurtling
velocity was in nowise apparent
they could not see the approaching
solar system precluded by the satel-
lites backward motivation but they
knew they were nearing sol and
hourly their spirits lightened-and at
the same time grew tense

  what would the outcome of this
cosmic drama be the first act of which
they had seen unfold

 lorg contacted them when it
seemed an eternity had winged past
still flushed by the triumphant recep-
tion his people had given him his
tones rang

  the culmination of a centurys
planning he fairly crowed you
have seen earthlings is there any-
thing to stop me i will take planet
after planet as easily as this first i
will build a great empire and my
people will make me grand superior
ruler over all torm

  shelton asked the question that was
haunting him

  how many planets do you plan
to take in the back of his mind
drummed that self-command find
out all you can

  at first it was planned the alien
superior said loftily to take only
pluto neptune and uranus and their
moonb and those only after arbitra-


startling stories

tion with earth certain timid ele-
ments in our ruling body fear war-
fare with earth but i do not fear
it his reptilian eyes blazed i
will not arbitrate i am going to take
all the planets one after another
your sun will be stripped bare my
sun tor will beam down upon a
great brood every planet earthman
do you hear

  shelton recognized the symptoms
lorg had gone mad with power it
was a common failure with all intel-
ligence whether torm or earthly
perhaps in the unsolved death of
martian civilization too could be
found the agent of power madness
moving a world with all the majestic
command of an omnipotent being
lorg had succumbed to further im-
possible ambitions

  impossible that word again and
so many times had it been the syn-
onym for the real that shelton felt an
ominous dread

mvow will you do it queried
-mm shelton quietly earth
forces will find some way of stopping
you even if the warp protects you
from attack here on iapetus earth
will eventually trace you to torm and
attack there

  shelton hoped it wasnt too obvious
that he was asking leading questions
trying to ferret out the details of
lorgs plans but lorg in flushed
confidence merely spoke scornfully

  a great fleet rides with iapetus in
fact most of our forces - thousands
upon thousands of ships they out-
number your earth forces by ten to
one our cold force though not quite
a match for your gunfire will be ef-
fective in massed battles whenever
earth ships appear my fleet will at-
tack decimate them thus we will
gradually cut down the earth forces
they will not find out about torm
till too late i will go on all the while
with my planet moving iapetus it-
self is immune from attack because
of the warp do you see earthling
shelton saw all too clearly an alien
egomaniac whose plans had all the
cunning of the power-mad ruthlessly
determined to annihilate a civiliza-

tion and there seemed no flaw in his
plans

  what about us-about me shel-
ton asked wearily

  you were to be the means of arbi-
tration with your government lorg
informed but that i have eliminated
from my plans however i have a
use for you dr shelton you are an
expert in bio-conditioning you know
the formula of adaptene later you
will show us how to make adaptene
that is one earth secret we have not
been able to uncover since it has been
guarded so well with adaptene we
will be able to condition our race to
the variations of climate that will re-
sult with far-flung planets then-

  but ill never give you the secret
of adaptene shelton broke in with
harsh stubborn defiance if you
know earth people as you claim you
know id die first

  you have forgotten we have a way
of extracting secrets from mens
minds while they are in suspended an-
imation lorg said calmly our
psychic extractor apparatus sends
sensitive x-rays into the brain they
come out modulated by the tiny elec-
trical currents of thought even the
circling ones of the memory cells by
suitable interpretation of the modu-
lated x-rays we read the original
thoughts it is something like your
voice-modulated radio waves being
translated to sound

  i could have used the psychic ex-
tractor with you already dr shelton
save that as i mentioned before the
first intention was to be used in nego-
tiations with earth however with
my change of plans you will be sub-
mitted to the psychic extraction upon
my next return to torm

  shelton recalled bennings account
of the chambers in which earth bodies
were kept like living records for the
mind-reading process he battled
with sheer hopelessness that threat-
ened to overwhelm him

  as i was saying resumed lorg
the adaptene will be used to condition
some of your people to our conditions
when the conquest is over when
your armed forces are annihilated and
your worlds and cities exposed our
the m f o s set kwtjrtt

cold force beams will sweep over
earthlings put them in suspended an-
imation later they will be adapted
and they will become slaves those
that are not left to die

shelton felt a sticky wetness
where his own nails had dug into
his palms drawing blood now the
full depth of lorgs terrible ambitions
was revealed he had the true de-
praved nature of the conqueror a de-
sire to destroy and enslave

  i will have no compunctions lorg
continued implacably you are after
all an alien race to us two diverse
species of intelligence can only have
hatred for one another one must
dominate the other we will dominate
yours

  on this ominous note the alien su-
perior clicked off

  and it was this ominous note like
a tormenting dirge that whipped
through their brains all during the
trip back to the solar system

  we must get away shelton said
a hundred times get away somehow
to organize earths forces with what
we know against lorgs horrible
campaign

  but how they could not get past
the warp with either their radio waves
or ship they had already ascertained
by experiment that the warp was on
at all times whether the satellite was
in motion or not evidently it was a
fixed and permanent feature of the
great machines operation only at
torm had it been turned off for a
while

  they were trapped as securely as
though in unbreakable chains shel-
ton felt himself turning old and gray
revolving scheme after scheme in his
mind none of which promised a ray
of hope

  when the familiar feeling of decel-
eration came they knew they must be
near the solar system probably they
were passing vanished plutos old or-
bit and approaching neptune

  neptune had two large moons one
so dark that it had been unknown and
unseen before  this outermost
moon of course would be the next an-
nexed and spirited away to torm

and then the solar system would be
humming with another mystery-the
third disappearance of a planetary
orb

  and no one would know or gues
how and where the black alien ships
would take care that no earth ships
followed them out into the void only
four people knew - four who were
trapped on iapetus no five knew-
the space scientist too

  shelton ground his teeth if only
the space scientist had spoken one
word-but useless to think of that
now

 we must get away he repeated
through clenched teeth pacing up and
down in the cabin like a caged tiger

  they could feel the beginnings of
maneuvers to attach neptunes second
moon to the gravity hook gigantic
cloudy neptune itself reared into their
sky as iapetus jockeyed into -position
the great machine beneath their feet
sent its teeth-jarring pulsations
through the ship

  shelton still pacing took no notice
a frown of concentration on his face

 must get away his brain was
chanting must get away he
stopped glaring at traft

  good lord man he snapped is
that all you can think of doing at a
time like this

 traft was clumsily fumbling
through his collection of small prints
with his big paws

  im trying to think rod he mum-
bled all these shots taken under-
ground-might be a clue he went
on in spite of sheltons snort im
going through them one by one its
a sort of review of what we know
heres a shot of the cave those sta-
lagmites and stalactites shine here-
he used his magnifying glass-like
ice they-

odney shelton stopped in
midstride ice he exclaimed
thoughtfully i noticed that too
when our flashlights shone on them
theyve existed there probably for
ages in the uniform cold with drop
by drop adding onto them from water
squeeed out of salt crystals in the
roof his eyes narrowed suppose
iu	lawlwl kiumny

he added tensely that a great heat
played on them what would hap-
pen

  theyd melt traft looked up
quickly with enough heat steam
would be formed

  live steam shelton said tightly
blown back into the corridor down
to the alien city underground-what
would that do

  hugh benning raised dull eyes in
which a light had dawned

  it would disorganize the aliens all
that heat like a terrific heat wave
would in any earthly city steam to
them would be like molten metal to
us

  shelton spoke tensely if we can
just force them to shut the great ma-
chine off for a few minutes-a few
seconds-the warp wouldnt be there
to stop us we could escape

  traft hastily ruffled through his
prints and picked one out

  a shot of the great machine he
said i took it from the opti-screen
while lorg was showing us views of
it look rod theres the cooling ap-
paratus

  shelton grabbed the print and ex-
amined it carefully with the lens

  a pump affair run by power from
the city mark this picture is price-
less if we blew steam down there
it would upset their cooling appara-
tus that keeps the great machine at
absolute zero it can only run at that
temperature they would have to shut
it off

  but how produce the heat the
steam puzzled traft it would take
a great amount of heat to do the job
and you cant even light a match in
iapetus air

  if we had one good heat-gun-
shelton glanced about the cabin
knowing in advance there was no such
instrument aboard

  there was one in the ranger ship
murmured benning he looked out of
the port at the crumpled wreckage and
shook his head no use looking for it
smashed to bits

  think think charged shelton
as hopeless looks were exchanged
the steam would do it im sure we
must figure out a way of producing

it

  myra benning spoke up we have
plenty of battery powr ip a ship like
this can that be utilized

  shelton mulled that over for a mo-
ment dubiously no he finally
judged wed have to have big re-
sistance coils we havent the appara-
tus-or the time we need large vol-
umes of heat rapidly

traft suddenly snapped his fin-
gers rocket fuel he cried
like any other explosive it can be
burned too in the open with oxy-
gen-

  wait sheltons voice cracked
eagerly if we could get the ship
backed up with its rear tubes stick-
ing into the cave-mouth - heat and
blowing pressure at once mark can
you do it

  traft had already leaped to the side
port looking the situation over

  ticklish he admitted wryly
and id need someone in the engine
room to keep the fuel lines open

  hugh benning came to his feet
used to be a fuel man in the space-
ways ten years ago ill keep the en-
gine at peak for you myra can watch
the dials for me

  well have to try it shelton de-
cided itll have to be done as quickly
as possible they have ships around
here some place theyll investigate
try to stop us of course

  strap in warned traft as hugh
benning and myra turned for the en-
gine room this is going to be a
rough ride

      chapter xix

through the warp

s big paws expert and quick
traft started the engine he
let it idle hummingly for five min-
utes in the meantime staring over the
intervening terrain to the cave mouth
planning with narrowed eyes then
ne turned back

  if i dont rip the hull off on some
sharp boulder he said grimly well
the impossible world



make it

  shelton realized the hazards no
ship had ever before been called upon
t traverse such rutted ground there
was no chance to raise the ship and
gently plopit near the cave mouth in
that nhort distance it was simply a
matter of wheeling over the jagged
ground trusting to luck

  the rear rocketb burst out in a deaf-
ening roar at the big pilots touch the
ship trembled inched forward then
catapulted ahead rocking crazily
the heavy craft bounced over the
twisted surface of iapetus muscles
strained traft kept himself hunched
forward within reach of the controls
and touched off the proper blasts

  like a fiery monster the etbl-
swung in a big arc for the cave mouth
tail end swinging as it neared timed
neatly the rear tubes were in line with
the cave only ten yards short but at
the last second the ship tipped crazily
almost bowling over

  side wheel shot panted traft

  a ravening burst of the retarding
rockets shoved the ship backward
grinding on its wheelless side but
the rear tubes were almost projecting
into the cave

  good enough shouted shelton
give her half blast so the ship
doesnt move from the rear-and keep
giving it

  a hollow rumble at the rear told of
long searing tongues of flame belch-
ing into the cave filling its confined
space with terrific heat that would
melt the ice turn the water to hissing
steam the blasting of the rockets
would then cram this steam down the
corridor

  s h e  o ns imagination vividly
painted the picture billowing clouds
of live steam rolling into the alien
city the torms thrown into a panic
the steam rolling on filling every cor-
ner of their cavern spaces large vol-
umes of heat released far more heat
than the cooling system for the great
machine could cope with

  he switched on the radio the roar-
ing crackle of the interfering warp
sounded if that stopped they were
free to dash away from iapetus

  it seemed they sat there for ages

with the rumbling thunder of the rear
rockets filling their ears was it futile
after all did the aliens have some
way of closing off the great machines
compartment

  suddenly shelton clutched trafts
arm black ships had arisen over the
horizon part of lorgs great fleet ma-
neuvering within the warp silently
ominously they winged close hover-
ing with their anti-gravity forces al-
most instantly the biting numbing
force of cold-beams gripped them pry-
ing into every nerve with congealing
fingers

  myras cry and her brother hoarse
yell came from below shelton began
fully to realize how potent such a
force could be in battle paralyzing
gunners pilots crews

  another couple-seconds panted
traft and were done-for

desperately cursing through
lips he could barely move the
big pilot jammed his knuckles at the
controls the rocket blasts cres-
cendoed as traft songht to cram more
heat and steam into the cave

  the next instant the bedlam of
noise changed queerly shelton stiffly
moved his head nearer the radio
speaker only a slight steady hiss
came from it

  the warps gone he cried
clumsily trying to shake trafts shoul-
der with a hand he could not feel
up-the ship-

  his throat seemed filled with liquid
air he slumped back with dancing
spots before his eyes

  traft responded like a berserk mad-
man he hunched his powerful shoul-
ders in defiance of the cold force that
had almost paralyzed them to rigidity
growling he threw his hands at the
rocket studs they were like ampu-
tated stumps muscles cracked with
strain

  somehow through sheer determina-
tion he hammered his wrists down
moved studs the rocket blast grew to
the thunder of take-off power bounc-
ing crazily on its wheelless side the
big ship jerked forward

  traft nudged over other studs with
his elbows the underjets belched
startling stories

and thrust the ship up into the air
the upward surge wsb almost enough
to snap their necks

  but there was a monfent of respite
as the cold beams momentarily lost
their range traft shoved the accelera-
tion lever over to its last notch like
a flaming comet the etbi- hurtled
up into the sky of iapetus beyond the
area that had once been the warp bar-
rier

  they were free

  shelton his senses swimming back
realized that but he also saw that a
horde of alien ships were at their tail
rapidly overhauling lorg was not
going to let his prey escape the black
ships zoomed close and again the
numbing force came into play al-
ready weakened by it shelton knew
they could not hold out long

  trafts eyes were smoldering
thoughtfully

  got to get away he mumbled
one possibility-richer fuel mixture
will give six gravities of acceleration
well go unconscious-or worse en-
gine might blow up but aliens
couldnt match that acceleration
automatic shut-off after five minutes
want to chance it rod

  shelton nodded last chance go
ahead

  traft poked at his controls setting
a robot shut-off five minutes ahead
then he grasped the fuel mixture
wheel with the heels of his two palms
and groaningly slammed it over from
normal to-rich with a terrific
surge the ship leaped forward

  crushing weight six times normal
came into being for the humans
aboard the etbi- each carried a
burden whose equivalent would be a
half ton on earth their senses
reeled into oblivion but before he
passed out shelton saw the alien
ships dwindle as though they were
going the other way

  traft clung to consciousness for a
moment longer there was a trium-
phant grin on his face but behind it
stark anxiety death whom no ac-
celeration could leave behind might
steal up on one or all of them over-
burdened hearts stopping-engine ex-
ploding-hull cracking open-any-

thing might happen during those five
minutes while super-ferces shoved
the ship through space then the big
pilot plunged into a river of dark-
ness   

shelton came to with an infinite
ache in every bone he moaned
with sharp pain as he moved his head
but the mountain that had been lying
on his chest was gone now the ship
was silent and unpowered he looked
around meeting t rafts eyes

  that did it the big pilots voice
was weak but jubilant no sign of
the alien ships

  shelton nodded in voiceless relief
looking for himself the stars shone
clearly with no black hulks blotting
them out iapetus was visible as a
large disk already it was maneuver-
ing to grip neptunes second moon
again after the temporary halt of the
great machines activity the earth
people had succeeded in stopping its
operation only for the minutes needed
for escape but for that shelton
was supremely thankful

  traft groaned suddenly and darted
out of his seat

  my camera the super-accelera-
tion had torn it from its clamp and
hurled it into the corner he picked
it up and his face cleared not a
scratch he said with almost more
relief than he had had for their
escape lets go down-see how the
others are

  shelton unstrapped himself and
managed to stagger down to the en-
gine room with muscles that threat-
ened to turn to water thankfully
he saw that the two down there
though numbed by the experience
were unharmed though grimy from
the engines fumes while it had been
blasting so furiously

  hugh benning looked up dazedly
we got away he asked hopefully

  at sheltons nod myra gave a cry
of joy

  thank heaven she whispered

 away from the aliens-from lorg
a little later when they had all re-
cuperated somewhat shelton spoke
to his companions his eyes lighting
grimly
the impossible world



  now that were away we can in-
form the empire the great ma-
chine on iapetus must be destroyed
without it lorgs whole diabolic plan
falls flat time is important it
would take too long to go to saturn
at least a week well radio them
something must be planned quickly

  lorg will have neptunes moon
transported and be back for the other
moon in no more than two weeks it
took a century to conceive and build
the great machine but only days for
its accomplishments if earth waits
too long half the planets will be
gone

  direct attack on iapetus wont
work hugh benning said heavily
lorg wants the earth forces to
attack against his superior numbers
on iapetus and be gradually cut
down hes probably ready to lose
ten ships to one

 he wouldnt lose that many
traft gloomily observed with grav-
ity control they can outmaneuver our
ships in space and that damned cold
force is bound to play hell with pilots
and gunners he shook his head
then on top of it all the warp pro-
tecting lorg and his underground
headquarters so thoroughly

 solemnly they looked at one
another baffled by a problem that
seemed insoluble

  sheltons mind battered against the
stalemate what could be done be-
fore lorg stripped the planets away
from the sun like peeling a ripe
fruit a queer expression spun in
his brain though it had little mean-
ing at the moment the best defense
is a good offense but suddenly it
crystallized into a plan a daring
breathtaking plan that made the blood
race through his veins

wjfcthy is it that lorg made
t such a desperate try to stop
us if hes invulnerable he de-
manded and answered himself ex-
ultantly because we know where
torm his home world lies

 you mean attack torm cried
benning most earth ships dont
carry enough fuel to get to pluto and
back much less torm

  but they can carry more fill every
available inch of cabin space
snapped shelton and bombs-
but what good would that do ob-
jected traft the great machine
would still be left i dont see-
listen to me shelton went on
rapidly lorg has most of the alien
forces in ships there on iapetus in
a way thats a tactical blunder if
torm is attacked he must send help
the warp must be lifted for ships to
leave on that mission while the
warp is lifted a fleet of our bips
secretly hovering dart down and
land then its just a matter of storm-
ing the underground city

  sounds like it might work cried
traft

  it will work shelton said confi-
dently if it is timed right

  providing croaked hugh ben-
ning lorg doesnt catch on and leave
half his fleet at torm now that weve
escaped

  thats up to chance admitted
shelton and to one more thing im
banking on - lorgs own certainty
that he is a mastermind and we are in-
ferior thinkers he pushed the pilot
toward the cupola im going to
write out what i want to say and
youll code it so lergs ears wont in-
tercept it then while im radioing
you scoot the ship in several direc-
tions alternately in case lorgs ships
are waiting to trace our position by
our signals

  shelton began writing furiously
composing the most startling message
that had ever been winged over the
humming ether lines of the empire
fleetingly he thought of the stupe-
fied surprise with which his fellow-
men would hear of iapetus the mo-
torized satellite the incredible theft
of pluto and of the impossible
world of aliens far out in the void

chapter xx
at bay with the aliens

four hours later when the por-
tentous message had found its


startling stories

way to earth the earth union coun-
cil gathered for the most momentous
conclave in its history r in all the
history of mankind

 shocked beyond words by what
they bard there was a period of ex-
cited dazed comment it all seemed
inconceivable fantastic - impossible
particularly the thought of a dark
sun companion to sol out in the
void unsuspected by astronomers
that was the impossible werld

  but they had the evidence of the
vanishment of three heavenly bodies
which could not be denied and di-
rector beatty one of the councillors
fiercely declaimed that his young pro-
tege dr rodney shelton had one of
the soundest minds he had ever
known and that every word he spoke
must be true

  bewildered the council took up
sheltons plans and as an official ges-
ture passed them in the record time
of half an hour for they knew that
in this stupendous crisis everything
depended upon the soundness of the
reasoning of a keen-minded young
scientist far out in space

  the council moved with unprece-
dented swiftness orders hummed
over wires and the vast intricate or-
ganization of interplanetary affairs
burst into feverish activity two
fleets had to be prepared but a strict
censorship specified by shelton him-
self kept the news from broadcast
channels so that lorgs radio would
not hear of it

  one fleet as planned by shelton
was composed of any and all commer-
cial ships available hastily loaded
with bombs and reserve fuel little
more than enough room for skeleton
crews was loft in the cabins private
ship companies were conscripted to
donate ships to the project space
crews were picked of the best and
most highly trained veterans of the
spaceways

  within three days this fleet soared
away from earth though only the
leaders knew it was bound for tor
on a grave mission and on the long-
est trip ever undertaken by man

  the second fleet was earths regu-
larly armed space navy and this

was carefully outfitted stocked and
primed for its part in the coming
struggle with it went a hundred of
the special etbi ships used to
transport bio-conditioned colonists
within these were a thousand men
bio-conditioned for a cold thin-aired
world liko iapetus director beatty
had heeded sheltons first message
three weeks before

  finally this fleet too winged into
space secretly bound for neptune
the climax would come in ten days
time

  a week later the space navy fleet
cautiously maneuvered near neptune
and got in touch with shelton on low-
powered coded radio signals further
details of their plan were gone over
item by item the success of the
coup depended upon timed bursting
action scout ships drilled with in-
structions were sent to a position be-
yond plutos former orbit to watch
for the return of iapetus and the
aliens

  the bombing fleet arrowing for
torm followed a curving course
plotted by shelton planned to avoid
passing close to lorg on his return
trip they arrived within the mar-
gin of time allotted and stopped to
hover beyond sight of torm they
sent back a brief long-range signal of
their readiness then waited with
cabins darkened rockets still the
men within were somewhat dazed by
the tremendous journey they had un-
dertaken but were grimly ready fer
action

receiving their signal shelton
  breathed a sigh of relief a
miracle had been accomplished al-
ready it was as if the english ar-
mada had sailed to the unknown
shores of america immediately after
its discovery by columbus

  finally the electrifying signal came
from the scout ships that iapetus was
rumbling up to the solar system
shelton gave the word and a coded
long-range signal was sent to the
earth fleet far out near tor these
ships thundered up to the lone planet
of the aliens swooping low and drop-
ping bombs in their cities
the impossible world

  the best defense is a good offense
sheltons plan carried out on two
fronts ten billion miles apart was
smashing to its climax

  in the jetbi- the four earth-
people awaited developments in an
agony of tenseness their cabin lights
were out beyond their ports they
could barely make out the first of the
space navy fleets occulting the stars
the sun was not visible to betray
them while they awaited the arrival
of the planet stealers they were in
the huge conical shadow of neptune
that speared far out into space

  telescopic observers aboard the
navy ships finally reported iapetus
approaching aiming directly for nep-
tunes great single moon that was
left lorgs world-sized tug slowed
and maneuvered into position the
two bodies drew closer iapetus
dwarfed beside the moon but it had
powers that could whisk the larger
body from its orbit as easily as pluck-
ing away a marble these powers
came into play invisibly

  the earth observers could see the
great moons orbital speed decrease
shelton turned his radio to low
power

  nows the time he said in a bare
whisper it will take them several
hours to reduce the moons orbital ve-
locity well creep up on the other
side of neptunes moon and be within
striking distance when the time
comes

  aye sir came back from the
navy commander and the other ships
were informed in the same careful

ently on the lowest of rocket
blasts sheltons ship and the fleet fol-
lowed neptunes shadow until they
were behind the moon from iapetus
then headed for its surface reach-
ing this vantage they crept slowly
cautiously around the neptunian
moons bulk it was a game of stalk-
ing and the enemy must not receive
premature warning

  finally they hovered high enough
above the moons surface so that
gentle underjets counteracted grav-
ity a slight glow over the horizon
told them they were just short of see-

ing iapetus-and being seen

  so far so good shelton mur-
mured to traft the call should
come to lorg at any moment now that
his world is being attacked it takes
radio waves just ten hours to come
from torm our fleet there attacked
just ten hours ago

  their own radio kept open got the
call from the bombing fleet suddenly
that the attack on torm had begun

  now he must know shelton said
tensely into the microphone he
whispered fleet attention move
slowly in view of iapetus at the mo-
ment their black ships rise to go to
torm the warp will be gone blast
down then at top maneuvering
speed

the fleet moved slowly ahead till
half of iapetus hung as a huge
moonlike object over their horizon
then they stopped awaiting the cru-
cial moment

  it should be soon now shelton
said hoarsely

  it had better be grunted traft
lorg has already dragged neptunes
moon out of its orbit given it a ve-
locity of a hundred miles a second
toward tor

  fifteen minutes passed a half
hour

  still no sign of alien ships rising
through telescopes they could be
seen as huge black blots resting on the
white surface of iapetus

  when would they rise  shelton be-
gan to wonder if his great plan had
failed was lorg so heartless so in-
tent on his goal that he would not
send the help his people must now
be clamoring for or had he some-
how been warned of the earth coup
or had he thought of possible attack
at torm and left half the fleet there
on the last trip

  shelton realized that the success
of his coup lay in the lap of destiny
which way had the wheel of fortune
turned-for or against earth rod-
ney sheltons mind was crucified by
doubts and agonized torment more so
than during any of the tumultuous
events preceding he did not know
that his fingers were squeezing trafts
vrvfflrfvnhir

shoulder until the big pilot winced

  shelton started his eyes strained
forward a ship moving across hia
vision ahead ready to put his lips
to the microphone for the advance
signal he suddenly drew back with a
violent curse

  the ship had not risen from iape-
tus it had drifted from neptunes
shadow and on its sides were two
big white crosses-the ship of the
space scientist

  he was on hand again watching
this episode of the mighty struggle
between two great civilizations a
mind divorced from all former attach-
ments living its own mad inde-
pendent existence unconcerned over
the turn tjf events no doubt were
the earth forces decimated the whole
empire of man exposed to alien con-
quest he would laugh coldly and put
the zero symbol representing human-
ity in his formula of the cosmos

  enraged at his own analysis shel-
ton shook with the temptation to
order the space scientists ship fired
upon destroyed he had refused to
warn the empire weeks back when it
would have meant much he was a
traitor to humanity wasnt he

  but shelton conquered his blind
anger such an act would instantly
warn lorg disrupt the whole coup
precarious a it was already

  fuming inwardly shelton saw the
space scientists ship glide back into
the shadow of neptune waiting for
what would happen

  shelton himself concentrated again
on a sharp watch toward iapetus in
the name of heaven would the black
ships never rise how much longer
could he stand the nerve-shattering
wait

  and then-it happened

 sheltons whole body jerked
violently black ships zooming up
from iapetus a long line of them
fully half of the total alien forces
they were streaming off toward outer
space to save their home world from
the savage bombing of the earth fleet
or extract revenge at least lorg had
tumbled into the trap the warp was
lifted iapetus was a free-floating
body now vulnerable to attack

  twisting his rheostat to full power
shelton shouted into the microphone
down at iapetus full acceleration
land near cave mouth blast away

the entire fleet leaped forward
like greyhounds unleashed the
etbi- under trafts skilled sure
touch led the van down they aped
toward iapetus at reckless accelera-
tions courting disaster on landing
but shelton had stressed the neces-
sity of speed before lorg should
know of the attack and once again
threw around iapetus his impreg-
nable warp

  with action started a deadly calm
settled over shelton half the dis-
tance covered-thfee-quarters would
they make it was lorg even now
reaching his hands to whatever con-
trols threw on the warp would all
these thousands of magnificent ships
smash into a terrible invisible bar-
rier to rebound as shattered broken
debris spattered with human blood

  shelton felt the weight of his re-
sponsibility in this daring desperate
attack yet in the back of his mind
was the voice of assured hope

  and a minute later his hopes were
fulfilled retarding blasts thundering
and splitting the thin air of iapetus
the navy ships plunged for the jagged
surface wheeling for a landing the
fleet had come as a wide-spread pan-
cake all arriving at almost the same
time it was the precision trained
skill practiced formation flying of
earths finest pilots sheltons heart
leaped with admiration

  but then he cried aloud some few
ships lagging burst into flying frag-
ments against an unseen barrier and
slithered off into space the warp had
been turned on again but too late
by-far the majority of the earth fleet
was nestling down for landing well
within the barrier those deaths of a
few brave men would not be in vain

  look out came trafts warning
roar bad landing

  shelton suddenly remembered their
damaged undercarriage gripped for
his seat handles with sweaty fingers
so precipitous had their descent been
that the underjets could not cushion
the impossible world



the fall though traft blasted them
valiantly

  the etb- landed with a jarring
thump rocking crazily as it rolled for-
ward a few yards with hull scraping
sheltons body straps broke and he was
flung against the wall the big pilot
face lit with concern quickly un-
strapped himself and picked shelton
up like a baby

  hurt rod he cried anxiously
sorry i couldnt-

  let me down snapped shelton
im all right but when he tried to
stand his left leg buckled under him
guess ive got a sprained ankle and
of all times-

  he broke off and hopped to the
radio

  fleet attention he barked man
your guns their ships will attack
soon give em hell weve got to hold
them off while the underground city
is stormed conditioned men atten-
tion come to the etbi-fourteen
immediately

chapter xxi
act of the space scientist

ith all moves discussed to the
last detail long before the
earth forces swiftly organized them-
selves the armed ships lay like
silvery dots in all directions bristling
guns pointed upward waiting for the
enemy ships to appear

  some of the ships lay half smashed
from bad landings on treacherous
iapetus but in these the men were
already in vac-suits here and there
unavoidably two ships had smashed
into one another in the close landing
maneuvers undoubtedly there were
some deaths ruined ships and guns
but on the whole the casualties of that
roaring precipitous descent were
slight

  from the special ships came the men
who had been bio-conditioned to the
iapetus air and cold they loped
rapidly across the rocky terrain con-
gregating around the etbi-

  they were to invade the under-

ground city on an equal footing with
the aliens unencumbered by vac-suits
they would be a mobile force swift
to attack much more effective in a
long-drawn-out hand-to-hand battle
than unconditioned men in vac-suits
shelton thanked the forevision that
had prompted him to ask for the cofps
as a hunch weeks before when con-
tacting earth to first reveal the alien
menace	

   they were armed with rifles ban-
 doliers of ammunition certain groups
 dragged with them wheeled machine-
 guns flame-throwers and ponderous
 heat-beam guns earth had been un-
 sparing in arming them with its best
 and most effective weapons

   shelton tried to struggle into his
 vac-suit but had to give up he would
 not be able to walk on his badly
 sprained ankle

   guess i cant make it he groaned
 mark you and hugh benning lead
 the men smash at the aliens with all
 youve got-force quick surrender

   and get lorg traft added grim-
 ly fastening his visor

   keep in constant touch with me by
 radi shelton admonished the bio-
 men have several along you can hook
 one on your belt his face lighted
 somberly weve got to win he
 declared earnestly we should now
 the battle was half won when we got
 past the warp go to it

   traft and benning stepped out of
 the lock in their vac-suits they con-
 versed briefly with the bio-men then
 set the lead toward the cave mouth
 a quarter-mile off

   alone in the ship with myra shel-
 ton and the girl looked out from the
 pilot port at the familiar though un-
 worldly landscape of iapetus dotted
 now with the waiting earth forces a
 hushed lull seemed to hang over the
 universe as though it were watching
 this soon-to-be bid for mastery be-
 tween two warring intelligences

   sheltons face clouded a little
 watching trafts army march to at-
 tack

   why did i have to get a sprained
 ankle he muttered now i have to
 wait up here like a lame duck its
 ironic isnt it miss benning


startling stories

  yes dr shelton

  they looked at each other strangely
finding it a little ridiculous that after
all they had been through together
they were still so formal in the swift
tumble of events they had carried
through without change a reserved
attitude to one another shelton smiled
a little and opened his lips to speak
but at that moment the radio blared
forth

  traft calling cold beams pouring
from the cave heres where they get
a taste of hot lead the battles on
rod

the first line of bio-men had fallen
to the ground writhing in the grip
of concentrated cold forces the sec-
ond line promptly began pouring rifle-
fire into the cave mouth in a mo-
ment the chatter of machine-guns and
the hiss of the flame-throwers joined
the battle sounds

  then over the horizon came the
black ships of the enemy in seemingly
countless numbers like buzzards
they swooped over the earth ships
pouring down their numbing cold
force

  the navy guns began popping vici-
ously in a steadily increasing roar
the larger dreadnaughts hurled their
thunderous big shells into the melee
black ships faltered peppered with
jagged holes and fell to the surface
to split open like eggshells their
plastic hulls though diamond-hard
could not withstand the battering of
earths most powerful guns

  but they kept coming in endless
numbers spraying down their cold
force with enough effect to prohibit
accurate gunfire here and there an
earth ships gunfire ceased entirely
as its crew was thrown completely into
suspended animation i the aliens
ever won with their strange weapon
all the earthmen would be prisoners
in a state of suspended animation and
later slaves

  but shelton was sure the enemy
could not win it might have been
different in space where the gravity-
ships could outmaneuver the rocket-
propelled ships but on solid ground
with the earth forces like a grim im-

pregnable fortress all the advantage
was with earth the alien ships were
raining down broken useless it
should be just a question of time be-
fore they would no longer be superior
in numbers and completely inef-
fective

  at the cave mouth traft had routed
the large force of aliens there al-
ready he was leaping into the cave
leading his men on in the light
gravity the men easily lifted bulky
machine-guns and heat-projectors
the bio-army disappeared from sight
invading the underground world

  a half-hour later trafts voice came
cheerily via radio

  overlooking the city now he re-
ported aliens swarming up the slope
armed with long sharp things ben-
ning says plastic swords and spears
as good as steel therell be hand-to-
hand fighting now they have us out-
numbered plenty but were reducing
the proportion with bullets flame and
heat sort of a-he sounded as if he
were a little nauseated-slaughter
but they have courage coming
through it all like demons hand-to-
hand fighting started now-

  you and benning keep out of it
warned shelton one slit in your vac-
suits and youre out of the picture
just stay back and give orders thats
your part

  right rod traft answered re-
luctantly half under his breath he
added anyway ill get some nice
snaps

  and so the battle raged on above
and below ground with the earth
forces rapidly gaining the upper hand
after an hour above ground shelton
could see that the black ships were not
coming in such tremendous numbers
any more they began to fall away
from the massed btand of earth ships
and retreated to the fringes where the
navy gunners continued to pick them
off one by one

  its practically all over shelton
breathed joyfully lorg should be
surrendering any minute now-
look

myra was pointing upward a
ship had dropped directly over
the impossible world



them hovering and then shelton saw
the two large white crosses on its
sides the space scientists ship

  none of the navy gunners had fired
for they had seen it was not an enemy
ship it lowered and landed just be-
yond the etbi-

  wonder what he wants here
shelton growled a front seat at the
big show im going to give him a
piece of my mind

  he turned to micro-wave nine and
barked into the microphone atten-
tion space scientist

  the space scientists masked head
appeared on sheltons opti-screen but
said nothing though his air of cold-
ness could be fairly felt

  look here shelton exploded
youre a traitor to your own race a
renegade you knew of the aliens but
you wouldnt lift a finger to help the
world you were born on had you
given the warning much of this would
not have happened-the disappearance
of iapetus and pluto men dying in
battle shelton choked with rage
youre going to pay for it you
thought you could come here observe
things as though it were all a gigantic
play for your benefit and then leave
but youre not leaving if you try to
go ill command the navy gunners to
fire youre going to be taken to earth
-and court-martialed

  the space scientist appeared to
show only studied indifference to the
threat

  court-martialed as a traitor
yelled shelton do you hear me
yes i heard you came back the
space scientists voice with a half
mocking note

  he raised his hands to fumble at his
mask as he removed it shelton was
thunderstruck at the face revealed

  it was the scaled visage of an alien
the aliens large dark eyes peered
at shelton with faint amusement

  i am murv he announced a
citizen of torm and an official just
beneath lorg in authority

  but the space scientist gasped
shelton where is he you have
his ship

  i am the space scientist the
alien stated calmly or rather i am

  the embodiment of the myth of the
space scientist you see with the
spreading of your race among the
planets it became imperative for us
to learn as much about earthly things
as possible we learned your language
from captured men then twenty
years ago i was commissioned by
lorg to drift close to earth to pick
up any and all information as to your
plans and exploits knowing that i
would eventually be sighted my pres-
ence questioned i devised the space
scientist story your authorities
finally came to accept me as a harm-
less if eccentric human who chose to
live in space

  so for twenty years an alien
masquerading as a human had been
spying on earthly activities no won-
der lorg had known so much

e alien murv went on

i took the precaution of having
false rocket tubes added to my gravity
ship and when i knew human eyes
were watching a chemical giving off
bright but cold phosphorescence was
ejected exactly as though i had a
rocket engine the two white crosses
i adopted as my insignia mainly be-
cause you humans regard that symbol
with peculiar reverence my mask and
the hinted story of a laboratory acci-
dent is self-explanatory

  these revelations dovetailed but
still in sheltons mind there were in-
consistencies

  you warned me not to go to iape-
tus shelton mused i understand
that now it was to avoid exposure of
your underground city but why did
you keep up that pretense when i con-
tacted you i was a prisoner and for
all you knew at the time a permanent
one

  i expected you later to act in the
arbitration between lorg and your au-
thorities murv informed my duties
then would have been to hover near
earth and watch for any secret moves
on earths part as the space scien-
tist i could do so with impunity but
branded as an alien by you i would
be hunted down driven away

  then an amazing thought struck
shelton


startling stories

  but up there at neptunes moon
before the attack he cried you saw
us earth forces waiting to attack
lorg why didnt you inform lorg

  shelton drew a sharp breath why
the whole coup could have been dis-
rupted all their careful plans whiffed
to eternity

  you had plenty of chance to warn
lorg he repeated dumfounded and
yet you didnt

  the swift thought was in sheltons
mind could the alien be a renegade
as he shelton had accused him

  the torm smiled strangely sadly
perhaps i did not want to warn lorg
he is defeated better so he bowed
his head for a moment

  murv looked up suppressing what-
ever feelings were his

  lorg went mad with power he ex-
plained he wanted to destroy and
enslave all earth people take all the
planets his own idea entirely my
people have good and bad elements
exactly as yours we all wanted
planets and endorsed the building of
the great machine for that purpose
but our reasonable element hoped to
gain planets purely by arbitration not
by force lorg betrayed us
momentarily fierce anger illumined
the speakers face before he went on
i kept waiting for lorg to arbitrate
through you but when after the tak-
ing of pluto he made no such move

i	knew he was planning bloody com-
plete conquests i knew too that he
would never succeed having ob-
served earthly doings for twenty
years i know of your spirit courage
your indomitable will lorg might
succeed in taking half the planets but
eventually the tide would turn and
then i knew there would be a bitter
war of extermination till either my
race or yours was obliterated from the
face of the universe

  murvs eyes held horror you see
now earthman why i did not warn
lorg i had been thinking for days
of what to do to avoid the inevitable
holocaust that lorgs course would
bring about i saw that with the suc-
cess of your coup a solution would be
reached quickly for i believe that
now with the elimination of lorg our

  races can come to an understanding

shelton realized during the mo-
ments murv had been speaking
that the entire complexion of things
had changed it was lorg who was
the arch-enemy of mankind its would-
be conquer er not his people tact and
consideration must now be used in
dealing with the torms

  will you expect more planets by
arbitration he asked

  murv shook his head no he said
softly we have forfeited our chance
through lorgs blundering tactics we
are now a defeated race with no right
to make demands i only ask that the
two bodies we have already taken to
tor-pluto and neptunes second
moon-be left to us

  i can promise you they will be
shelton said promptly our sole aim
at the moment is to destroy the great
machine so there will be no more
world moving and i think the basis
for a permanent peace between our
races will be your promise never to
build another great machine

  you will be given that promise
gladly the alien said earnestly

we-

  a new voice burst in on the all-wave
circuit trafts voice from below
shelton had almost forgotten that a
battle was still raging there

  weve got them licked rod  came
the big pilots bellow we swept
through the city drove them back
one earthman is worth ten torms
theyve thrown down their arms in
surrender weve surrounded the
chamber in which lorg has barricaded
himself were battering down the
door there it goes-and theres
lorg

  shelton snapped on his auxiliary
opti-screen barked into the phone

  shelton calling lorg 

      chapter xxii
      the moon bargain

lorgs autocratic features twisted
with bitterness appeared on the
the impossible world



second screen

  you must surrender lorg barked
shelton your ships above ground
have been driven off my men down
below-

  they had bet not step nearer
threatened the alien superior i have
my hand on the master switch of the
great machine if i close it all its
energy will be released at once tear-
ing iapetus apart with its terrific
stored forces

  his face gleamed evilly madness
shone from his eyes true madness
now from the crashing of his power

  you have won earthman he said
sardonically but i hold your life in
my hands in revenge-

 dont murv cut in sharply
dont destroy iapetus and all on it
then earth will never know the true
facts and the war will go on

  lorgs left hand reached to the side
to -tune an auxiliary screen

  you murv he ground out i
suppose this is all to your liking
with me out of the way you would
arbitrate but i tell you races alien to
one another cannot live in peace one
must dominate the other if i had
succeeded we would have ruled the
earthlings now since all is lost ill
at least take with me into death the
earthman who brought my downfall
shelton thought rapidly in this
frightful moment of impending death
for all

  i think you had better not lorg
he said quickly you may have for-
gotten that you started to move nep-
tunes moon before the attack came
you had given it a velocity of about
a hundred miles a second - toward
tor that velocity is not lost as you
know from the laws of motion in space
it will take time at that slow rate but
if you destroy iapetus the free-plung-
ing moon will eventually reach tor
crash into it drawn by its gravitation
the impact will send out a wave of
scorching heat and blinding light to
torm your planet if you destroy
iapetus now you destroy all your peo-
ple

  lords mad eyes glared in momen-
tary indecision his insane mind
seemed trying to determine whether

that was so mad or not he could not
let his own people be destroyed to let
the earth-people reign supreme in
their binary universe

  cold sweat beaded sheltons fore-
head he felt the wings of death
brushing closer than at any time in all
this strange adventure myras face
was ash-white her eyes wide as though
staring into eternity even murvs
alien face reflected the stark horror of
the moment all the satellite seemed
to be held in an electrified stasis

  lorgs right hand on the great ma-
chines master control grew limp for
an instant and in that instant there
came a sharp zing and the nauseating
sound of the impact of a bullet in liv-
ing flesh a hole appeared in lorgs
right temple as if by magic pale blood
gushed forth his limp fingers tight-
ened for a moment on the switch han-
dle then relaxed and fell free with
an expression of stark bewilderment
lorg the alien conqueror slumped to
the floor-lifeless

  whew came trafts voice in a
long-drawn-out sigh if i had
missed-

  for a moment shelton leaned back
panting

  good work mark old boy he
murmured finally

vtb snapped himself alert mat-
jem ters had to be attended to

  mark he ordered find all earth-
men down there who are in suspended
animation benning can point out the
chambers bring them up to be taken
to earth and revived when you come
up leave a few of the bio-men n
guard

  okay rod and while im going
around ill be taking a complete series
of pictures of this place ill get some
kind of a prize for them on earth

  shelton looked at the image of
murv the alien had stood unmoving
since the death of lorg his face ex-
pressionless there was no clue to the
thoughts going through his mind but
faintly shelton could sense bitterness
perhaps at the crashing of planb he and
his people had nourished for a cen-
tury

  can you direct the handling of the
great machine murv shelton asked
  the alien nodded

  then you will have the moon of
neptune put back in its orbit shel-
ton said after that the great ma-
chine will be destroyed

  he would not feel a moments peace
until that had been done and the
threat of its terrible powers removed
forever

  but the alien remained silent for a
moment then he said slowly his
tone half apologetic

  there would be no need to put the
moon back into its orbit

  but you surely dont want your
world destroyed shelton snapped
impatiently

  the alien shook his head no that
would not happen tor swings in an
orbit itself with sol when the moon
of neptune arrived it would swing to
one side of tor tors great attrac-
tion would then grasp it pull it into
an eccentric orbit neptunes moon
would be captured as a body of tors
system

  you mean shelton queried won-
deringly that you would want to have
the moon as another world in your sys-
tem this was all incongruous fan-
tastic this bargaining for worlds im
afraid it cant be murv i have no au-
thority to present you with another
planetary body- he stopped won-
dering how to say it you already
have pluto and neptunes first moon
at tor no sense in taking them back
but to let this second moon of nep-
tune go-

  i am asking for this moon the
alien said softly firmly for my peo-
ple we will remove our colonies on
neptune and uranus leave your sys-
tem free iapetus will be destroyed
in the void between our systems and
our pronjise will be given never to
build another great machine let this
moon be a token of peace between us
sheltons thoughts were in a tur-
moil was this some trick on murvs
part

  was he scheming to carry on the
aliens program now that lorg was
gone shelton felt ashamed of him-
self instantly no obviously murv
was sincere

wit is such a small thing to ask
ji earthman murv went on his
voice vibrant this moon is but one
of your many bodies ours is an im-
poverished system yours rich with
worlds what difference can it make
it this little moon is gone from your
sun when you have giant jupiter and
saturn and their moons and all the
other great planets and we have so
little to us this one moon would be
a great new world can you under-
stand earthman how long we have
lived on one lone planet gazing across
with our telescopes to your magnifi-
cent system can you blame us for
building the great machine hoping to
bargain for some of your worlds re-
sults have been unfortunate but that is
over i am asking pleading for this
one more moon surely you can spare
it

  shelton could glimpse the aliens
depth of emotion with all the elo-
quence at his command he was beg-
ging for another small world for his
restricted system and incredible as
it might seem shelton knew that he
sympathized with him

  murv the moon is yours shelton
said quietly i may be utterly crazy
for taking this responsibility but i
am he grinned briefly at the thought
of facing the council on earth and
blandly telling them he had given
away a moon

  for a moment the two stared into
one anothers eyes alien and earth-
man a spark of something akin to
brotherhood passed between them
there would be peace between earth
and torm in the coming ages  

  a day later after iapetus had been
motivated under murvs guidance to
a point far beyond plutos former or-
bit all the ships within and upon it
left the black ones of the aliens
streamed out into the dark void to-
ward tor the fleet of earth soared
with thrumming rockets toward sol

  within the pilot cupola of the
etbi- traft and hugh benning
had their heads together plotting the
return course after the take-off

  lets go down to the cabin myra
shelton suggested to the girl beside
him
the impossible world

 traft turned to watch shelton
limping had his arm around the girls
shoulder for support but they were
also holding hands traft snatched
up his camera and clicked the shutter

  ive been waiting for that shot he
grunted in satisfaction

 hours later as murv had set the
timed mechanism to throw the master
control of the great machine de-
serted stranded iapetus exploded into
cosmic debris ripped to atomic shreds
by the release of world-moving gravi-
tational force stressed within the
great machine and lorg-and his
dream-were no more

  shelton stared back at the bright
ring of shimmering dust that ex-
panded and faded into the dark void
it was hard to believe that their great
adventure had been real that a world
an impossible world of aliens existed
close in the void that a planet and
two moons had been whisked from sol
to tor that he had been instrumental
in ending an unsuspected menace one
that had been hanging over them for
a century

  and last that be had given away a
moon as a symbol of peace between
their races

  shelton felt content

the nan from mars

 by p schuyler miller

                  author of duft of dehructiun the red plague etc

surely a circus is no place to
look seriously for a martian-
particularly professor von
tempskis little one-elephant show
and yet there it was - blazoned in
huge crimson letters the man
from mars fifty cents hav-
ing a normal curiosity i lingered

  above the door of the martians
elaborate tent hung a painting of
mars over its entire face ran
a fine tracery of lines-schiaparellis
canal i lowells canals - more
than i had seen on any published
sketch

  absolutely the most stoopenjus
spectakle known to mankind cried
the barker unequaled by the wiz-
zudry of modern science ladies and
gennlemun - a living breathing
speaking man from the planet mars
the exiled prince of another race-
lost in the endless sea of empty space
-drawn by mysterious forces to our
own little world and persuaded to en-
tertain the intelligent citizens of
kansas with examples of the wonders

of another world only fifty cents

  behind the barkers stand was a
great canvas drop inscribed with a
series of names renowned to the
world of science endorsing the sci-
entific worth of the man from mars
most of them were literally peppered
with degrees at least fifty per cent
unknown to earthly education they
may have been from martian universi-
ties

  but down in the lower corner was a
name that brought me to with a rude
jolt - harvey henderson bs i
slammed down my four bits grabbed
the ticket and shouldered through
the gaping crowd of farmers into the
tent i too wanted to see the man
from another planet

  slowly the tent filled the crowd
faced the curtained stage then the
lights waned and died the whisper-
ing of the audience sank ceased now
a faint music was playing behind the
curtain soft and full of overtones
softly the curtain parted and drew
aside
hall of fame

  a great gilded chair stood on a
raised dais in the center of the stage
beside it stood a table with cathode
tubes tesla globes and the like on
the throne itself hunched down in

its gilded depths was the man from
mars

 a sense of keen disappointment
filled me at the sight of him this
martian was pathetically human with

dugans face blinding him
his thin body with huge chest swathed
in dull rad robes spindling legs and
arms with bony protruding joints
large delicate hands and small feet
but the large and magnificent head
seized everyones attention it was
half again as large as our own a
smooth bald pink dome with great
ears rising above a bulging brow and
tiny wrinkled face a little full
mouth was pursed under a slightly
hooked nose above sunk deep be-
neath masive hairless brows were
his eyes

  those eyes in those great orbs
was all the beauty of another world-
living vibrant ageless beauty with a
sort of grave wisdom and penetration
that seemed to gaze through and be-
yond you in that moment i knew
that this was more than a cheap side-
show

  the martians long tapered fingers
danced over a keyboard fixed to the
chair-arm from one wing a low rub-
ber-tired cart rolled out bearing an
instrument that i recognized as a
variant of the common theremin
soft music was drifting from its
speaker a second cart appeared bear-
ing a large plate-glass tank of water
with goldfish swimming about in it

  the martians hands began playing
a witchs dance on the ivory keys
leaping faster than the eye could fol-
low the instruments beside the
throne rose as on wings into thin air
swept forward grouped above the
forestage a pause and then a group
of three high voltage discharge tubes
began to blaze with color leaping
pulsing color far beyond any earthly
art

  the thin-stalked bulb of a cathode
ray surged to the fore hung for an in-
stant then began its weird glow as its
hurtling rays ionized the air a little
half-sphere of seme dark mineral
darted up before the window of the
tube into the path of the rays

  instantly it blazed with blue flame
scintillant with dancing sparks of
orange-red then the ray died and
the discharge tubes yet the cold blue
flame burned on alone swinging in
slow small circles above our heads
until a scurry of keys bore it from
sight

  and now came the real marvel of
the entire program a second tank
appeared with fish like the first
the tesla globes swam out ten-inch
spheres of brass poised perhaps ten
feet apart and silent lightning began
to play between them a lacework of
pale electric flame that danced with-
out the customary crackle of a high-
tension spark the water of the twin
tanks began to rise draw away from
the sides mount into a rounded cone
that slowly elongated until it tore
loose from the glass with a little sigh
leaving the fish in perhaps six inches
of water at the bottom of the tank

  freed the liquid cones bulked into
two spheres of water floating over-
head swinging slowly about each
other to the rhythm of the flame-song
suddenly they merged in a single
great globe of water a dozen feet in
diameter drifting unsupported above
our upturned faces

  this sphere defiant of gravity be-
came opaque milky vague shapes and
outlines appeared on its spinning sur-
face forming a globe of the earth that
hung before us earth seen from out-
side from open space

  it faded as it had come forming a
new world in its stead-rose-red with
capping of white and a tracery of fine
green lines over its entire face run-
ning from red of desert waste to cool
green of vegetation from southern
ice to northern snows i recognized
the planet mars

  it was a spectacular exhibition
then the globe shone clear divided
and descended as water back to the
tanks the curtain fell the lights
came up and we filed in hushed won-
der toward the door

  as i turned outside to leave a hand
fell on my shoulder the husky voice
of the barker was in my ear

  hey he wants to see you inside-
the guy that runs it go back that

ondering i went back to a
flap in the rear of the tent
pushed through i was back-stage
the throne and all the rest of the para-
phernalia before me the form of the
martian slumped wearily in the scant
comfort of its gilded seat a familiar
w

figure was bending over him he
swung around to greet me and i
recognized harvey henderson

  well you old dingbat howd you
like the show he chuckled

  man its big i gasped what
is it

  its the real mccoy he said
tersely but i wish id never seen
it-or him it cant last hank and
im afraid the breakup will come
pretty soon

  you mean this is not just a show
i asked

  this is really a man from mars i
said henderson

 where did-he-come from-how
did he get here of all places i fal-
tered

  ill explain right now come and
meet him he saw you watching the
show i guess he senses a kindred
spirit

  henderson turned and looked deep
into the great eyes that had been star-
ing at us the form on the throne
stiffened rose to its feet moved
jerkily toward me the eyes caught
mine held them seemed to swim into
my very being and search my inner
self the martians hand was rough
and dry lifeless like a mummys his
face was of the same coarse texture
unlike any flesh that i had ever seen
but i knew somehow this was no fake
the martian sensed my thoughts for
something like a twinkle appeared in
his eyes

  i have a shock for you hank
henderson said watch

  he fumbled at the nape of the mar-
tians neck pressed sharply there
was a click and the martians body
collapsed into a crumpled heap of red
cloth and wire-framed pseudo-flesh

  only his head remained suspended
in midair with a three-foot cylinder
of faintly violet opaque crystal dan-
gling beneath it another click and
the great cranium split just behind
the ears henderson laid the halves
carefully aside and stood back the
martian-the real man from mars-
floated before me

  a squat three-foot cylinder of violet
crystal two feet in diameter rose un-
broken to a transparent hemisphere
of quartz glass which housed the real

head of the martian it was startlingly
human only the fine great eyes were
the same

 above and about the martians
head inside the crystal globe was sus-
pended a network of very fine silver
filaments with cables like spiderweb
running down into the hidden in-
terior of the purple cylinder

 he cant make sounds in our
audible range henderson told me
but he has a power telepathy of some
sort by which to express himself it
is a crude method at best with us but
i am getting able to identify a few of
the more abstract mental impressions
ive had plenty of practice in the last
five months

  five months i wondered

  henderson replied with a smile
six months ago the martian landed
on earth in his space ship he was
out on an exploring trip when he ran
across a farmer who promptly locked
him up in the silo as a menace to the
natural world of genesis

  thats where i found him-in ice-
lands silo already sold to this circus
as a freak leland showed me the
martian he sort of attached himself
to me-felt that he stood a better
chance of establishing communication
i guess-and it wasnt long before he
did get his first message across

  i was examining him in the barn
door when all at once my automatic
pencil hopped out of my pocket and
began to scurry over a piece of new
pine flooring it drew a picture-a
map of north america-then hovered
over it sort of questioning me i
caught the idea and put a cross on the
place where we were

  that was just the start pretty
soon i caught the telepathy idea it
takes two to make it work - and it
wasnt long before i had the story
roughly pieced out lakjzt was voy-
aging to earth from mars

  all went well until he hit the
heaviside layer lost control and
plunged to earth his car is buried in
some hillside here in kansas weve
got to find it

  leland had already sold lakjzt to
von tempski and i couldnt block the
sale so i came along and set up this
show and it has been making money
for the circus but theyre not sat-
isfied theyve seen what his electro-
magnetic control of space curvature
can do in the way of moving things
and they want to have him hoist the
elephant in the main show

  they dont realize what a mental
strain it is on him to do all that levi-
tation we fixed up this mechanical
man to fit around him and make him
more comprehensible as per the man-
agements orders

  but what can you do about it i
wanted to know its a shame
do now with your help well
rescue him and search for that space-
car of his then-au revoir hell
stick pretty dose to mars when he
gets back well hank how about it
dp we swindle old prof von tempski
out of his man from mars

 we do that i answered with-
out hesitation my cars outside
this is slavery if a man like this
martian has been treated as you say
we owe him whatever we can do to
help him out

  the light in the martians eyes told
me that he understood me and was
grateful i experienced a queer sort
of thrill at the mental contact

having agreed to wait until
dark i left just before the
evening performance returning i
nearly ran into a big beefy german
whom i recognized by his mustaches
as von tempski he jerked past me
and stamped off toward the big top
lashing the air furiously with his ring
masters whip i knew at once that
something was brewing and hender-
sons first words were no surprise

  its happened hank he growled
weve simply got to get lakjzt clear
tonight von tempski was just here
and he wants the martian to wind up
the big show tonight by juggling most
of the menagerie i told him it
wouldnt go-that it was entirely a
matter of mental control of enormous
forces locked up in that crystal cylin-
der and that no mind can heft an en-
tire circus and not break

  what are we waiting for i said
ill bring the car up back of the tent
and you can slip out i opened the
flaps stopped come here quick i

whispered and keep quiet

  he poked his head through the flaps
beside me lined up before the tent
were five husky teamsters with them
a dapper fish-faced individual he
had some electrical apparatus set
upon soap-boxes-a wimshurst static
machine and a dozen big condensers

 henderson muttered in my ear
thats dugan the manager hes
got a static machine damn him he
has us tied even the smallest electric
field knots lakjzt all up-paralyzes
his control completely hell be help-
less what can we two do against
those bruisers from the tent gang

  i saw dugan and the teamsters turn
and stare in our direction dugan be-
gan to spin the handle of the wim-
shurst machine building up his field
he jockied the contacts and a fat blue
spark crackled between them

 then something hard and cold
shoved past us-the martian he hung
just inside the shadow of the tent
staring inscrutably at the four figures
out there then he returned and
darted here and there among his ap-
paratus evidently with some definite
project in mind henderson compre-
hended and ran forward to help the
martian who spun around to face him
there were a few brief seconds of that
uncanny mental conversation then
henderson came running back

  listen he whispered weve got
to fox dugan you go right on out to
your car now and when i whistle give
her all shes got along the south road
follow this map

  i strode down the narrow aisle be-
tween the two tents walked slowly
over to the car started it then waited
all the time i kept a weather eye on
the tent and what was happening
there first henderson stepped out
bent to tie a shoelace a second form
burst from the flaps and streaked
toward the apparatus it was the
artificial manlike husk of the mar-
tian even in the shadow of the alley
i could see that lega and arms dangled
limply

 dugan yelled something at his
guards quit cranking and ran forward
himself the thin big-headed body of
the seeming martian sped straight on
and over the row of condensers re-
gardless of the barring electric field
dugan sensed something wrong stop-
ped short then leaped forward again
with a curse as henderson followed
the martian 

  now came the climax of the whole
plan out of the public entrance to the
tent flashed a squat cylinder of glow-
ing purple crystal six little globes of
vivid blue fire circling it like tiny
satellites the teamsters stood aghast
staring open-mouthed in a little
streak of blue flame one of the spheres
flew to meet dugan burst in his face
with a dazzling glare of white light
blinding him with an agonized yell
he staggered forward tripped and lay
groveling rubbing his seared eyes
with his fists and whimpering like a
scared pup the martian had directed
his dummy from the tent to fool du-
gan coming out in his true form to
give battle

  the white flame blazed three times
then again with double force dugan
and his bruisers were writhing about
the wimshurst machine was a twisted
wreck beside shattered condensers
and the squat form of the martian was
speeding toward my car its halo of
blue moons gone

  as lakjzt popped into the car be-
side me hendersons shrill whistle
split the air beyond the tents and the
clamor of a starting ford followed i
started rolling toward the south gate
at thirty an hour as i passed the big
tent i noticed that von tempski and
two ring-hands were running toward
the entrance evidently we would be
chased

but henderson had cared for that
the half-dozen hands including
old von tempski who poured out into
the lane of side-shows saw his old
ford with the artificial form of the
martian stiff beside him careen
through the gate and burn up the road
north they fell for the subterfuge
and i had no pursuers

  the rest of what happened that
night is a bit vague to me in the first
place a thunderstorm was coming up
and the overcast sky was electrical
with lightning it didnt bother me in
the least but to the martian it must
have been sheer hell

  the wimshurst machine had stop-
ped him and even the disturbance
from the engine must have given him
bad moments but now the atmosphere
was supercharged with electricity
pouring it into him with every pass-
ing second he must have absorbed
plenty of juice from the air storing it
up in himself and the car

  we were doing a good fifty on the
up-grade when we came to a railroad
crossing we hit it with a tremendous
jolt that clashed the rear springs and
brought the back end of the car too
close to the rails it all happened in
a split second first came a brilliant
glare of blue electric fire and a crack-
ling discharge followed by a dull
boom as the gas tank went up

  the martian beside me began to
blaze with a dazzling white radiance
that mounted and mounted in bril-
liance to a blinding peak then went
out in a smash of shattering glass as
we were both blown through the wind-
shield i hit in the mud messy but
safe lakjzt landed with a crash that
shattered his cylinder leaving him
fully exposed to the unfamiliar un-
friendly conditions of earth

  i lost consciousness when i finally
came to the storm had passed and the
car had burnt out but where was the
martian the moon showed me
sparkling on his shattered chrysalis
just beyond me for a moment i stood
aghast at the change for lakjzt was
entirely different from the domed
cylinder that i had come to know i
had realized that it was but a covering
a protective shield against the alien
conditions of earth but the reality of
the creature within staggered me

  there was the same humanlike head
and face without the silver filaments
and quartz dome but beneath was a
long tapering cone of dead-white
flesh neckless with a spatulate lower
end like the body of some sea-slug
just beneath the tiny chin sprang a
tangle of fine gray filaments like lit-
tle ashen tendrils writhing feebly

  he was not yet dead the moving
tentacles and the agonized pleading of
his great eyes told me that the press-
ing atmosphere of earth must be sheer
torture to hfs unprotected body over-
coming my instinctive aversion in pity
i bent down and scooped up the limp
body of the martian the moon was
high and by its dim light i looked
down at the creature i held in my
arms it was surprisingly warm all
over the smooth flesh were long
scratches from the broken crystal and
the blood that oozed from them was
as red as my own from a painful shoul-
der gash above all its head was hu-
man-it wa human those great eyes
were pleading with me again trying
vainly to penetrate my dullness to
speak

i could all but sense the agonized
thoughts that battered at the por-
tals of my brain he wanted to tell
me something something vital i felt
a tugging at my arm something thin
and warm twining about it-the tiny
gray tentacles of the martian they
were trying to pull his body higher
toward my wounded shoulder for a
moment i stood puzzled then the
truth swept through me and i raised
him in my arms

  those gray filaments were nerve
fibers eagerly they played over the
gash in my arm probed it dug into the
exposed flesh there was a moment of
burning pain when i nearly dropped
him as nerve met ruptured nerve and
made contact then the pain vanished
and distinct messages were leaping
through my brain the thoughts of the
martian pouring into me through the
connected nerves of my arm i re-
ceived pictures sensations even emo-
tions and i knew that they likewise
surged in that little human head and
three-foot cone of flabby flesh

 one thing was clear enough he
wanted to leave here - to go some-
where and go fast where my un-
spoken question must have passed over
the gray network to the martians
brain for at once there came a sleepi-
ness a sort of creeping numbness over
ray whole body  let myself go limp
but my arms did not unclasp my
knees did not collapse without hesi-
tation my body turned and stalked off
through the com the martian had
taken oer control

 that last stage of our strange
journey was the most uncanny of all
experiences i had none of the sensa-

tions of walking of holding the dead
weight of the martian i the de-
tached mental i was utterly apart
from the thing that was my body

  fatigue is largely menjtal and the
brain that now ruled every sensation
and motion of my body was the brain
of the man from mars under the con-
trol of this alien creature spurred by
a mind not of earth  was performing
feats of strength that should have
been impossible to a wounded man

  yet my mind was alive observing
this insane cross-country dash and en-
joying it the thrill was beyond all
tempering of reason

  at last we reached what looked to
me like a small hill of raw earth i
watched my erstwhile hands strap the
martian to my back with my suspen-
ders then plunge into the earth of the
hillside and begin tearing away at it
like a dog on the trail of a mole idly
i watched me eagerly awaiting the re-
sults of my hands wild burrowing

  the layer of soil was thin four feet
or less in depth and beneath lay the
hulk of some flame-scarred pitted
metal the space ship of the martian
we had come straight across the face
of kansas to this mound of new earth
beneath which something had been
calling telepathically through miles of
space to the martian

  as the last weed-grown clod fell
away i was whirling at the port with
a sure knowledge of its mechanism
unscrewing it casting it aside i
clambered into the gap bending low
crawled through a second sliding
valve that closed behind us in an
open space i stood erect and fumbled
low on the wall for a switch of some
sort soft light sprang into being we
were within the martian space ship

  try as i will i can never visualize
any of the details of the welter of ap-
paratus that surrounded me i have
only the impression of the interior of
a great globe containing a mass of
silent machinery dial after dial and
key-board on key-board against the
far wall rested a tank of bluish crystal
half full of a milky liquid my body
darted to it my hands threw off her-
metic seals with frantic haste while
over my shoulder the martian craned
anxiously
the man from mars



floating half-submerged in the
liquid its eyes closed lay a minia-
ture replica of the man from mars
my hands lifted it gently to the face
beside my own then bore it swiftly
across the sphere to another cabinet
bathed in the roseate light of twin
tubes laying it on a cushion of some
soft blue fabric i expertly manipu-
lated the finely graduated daile set
above the machine regulating warmth
oxygen moisture

  for long minutes our two heads
stared down at the little form lying so
still and white against the blue
cushion then its tiny filaments began
to stir flickering over its cold little
body its lips flushed crimson once
more and its eyes opened looked won-
deringly about it fell on us

  they examined us with a wisdom ill
befitting a baby of any breed or planet
a faint appeal began to swim in them
in response my hands played again
over the dials mechanical fingers ap-
peared from the side of the cabinet
proffered a capsule of some colorless
liquid which the infant swallowed
again it observed us wisely then its
eyes closed and it slept

  the tank was an incubator of some
sort set to control and delay the
strangely artificial birth of the in-
fant martian the enforced absence of
lakjzt had almost been too long

  still under lakjzts control i
opened a cabinet took out one of the
crystal cylinders such as the martian
had worn before my hands lifted him
from my back lowered him carefully
into the wire-lined tube his head and
a few thin filaments alone protruding
from the top one by one the gray
threads withdrew from my gashed
shoulder and there swept over me an
anguish of tortured mind and body
such as i never want to know again
as the last fine neutral filament
slipped into the tube and as the full

sense of my cruelly exhausted body
hit me in one huge wave of knifing
agony i fell senseless to the floor in
a heap

  lakjzt cared for me while i lay un-
conscious from the strain in the body
that he had borrowed and so cruelly
used later he ventured near the farm
that was to have been our destination
found henderson there and brought
him to the hill he removed me to the
outer world and delivered me to hen-
derson a bruised and battered wreck
of what i had been yet strengthening
fast from the healing science of an-
other race and planet

  then lakjzt bade us good-by for
an instant he hovered over me the
crystal hglmet tipped back and two
fine nerve-threads flickered forth
sought the yet unhealed gash in my
arm a brief message-a single pic-
ture-then the connection was broken
the dome shut the man from mars
vanished into the darkness of the air-
lock henderson drew me back to the
edge of the marsh where we crouched
waiting

  the port was closed sealed from
within deep within the hill sounded
a throbbing as of great hidden engines
and of a sudden came a great burst of
golden light a crash of rushing air
and the martian space ship was gone
forever

  one thing rests untold what was it
that prompted the martian to endure
again the torturing pressure of
earths atmosphere for that one mo-
ment when the connection was made
and a thought a message flashed
through my brain the message itself
is the answer in that brief instant of
contact i envisioned an earthly
mother and in her arms a laughing
child and i knew the answer to the
riddle that had been stirring my
thoughts the man from mars was a
woman

the mental marvel oe france

one step   evariste galois accused the teacher you have cheated
how can you have the answer to this problem so soon ten minutes be-
fore the others how did you do it

the shy frail boy of  answered timidly but earnestly by quadratics
sir the problem is so easy by that method

what roared the instructor angrily you little rascal can you stand there
and tell me that and expect me to believe you why i havent taught you
quadratics that is for older pupils

please sir its true remonstrated young galois you see i have read the
texts of lagrange and abel and have worked all their examples

not recognizing the boy as a genius the stupid instructor glared and spoke
wrathfully that is incomprehensible you have cheated somehow and lied
i therefore give you a failing grade in mathematics

two steps 	

tioa on an original theory of algebraic equa-
tions two years of genius wasted

  three steps   

  galois was having his entrance examina-
tion at the famous polytechnique univer-
sity

  the professor asked sternly how can
you know the answer to the problem with-
out using the blackboard

  i did it in my head answered galois
truthfully

  the instructor smiled sarcastically only
a genius could do that you have tricked
me by buying the answers before you came
your application to this university is re-
jected 

  four steps   

  would no one believe that a youth in his
teens was ready for a mathematical career
galois felt his heart breaking under the
successive blows of a cruel fate one last
desperate try for recognition that paper on
the theory of equations submitted for the
grand prize at the academy of sciences
paris maybe he would win

  but fate engineered its crowning jolt ex-
perts picked his work as the winning entry
it was turned over to a secretary and this
man lose it twice in two years galois
works of genius had been carelessly almost
maliciously it seemed dropped into limbo
five steps   

  embittered he had given up and joined
the revolutionists of 



evariste galois bom in  was now
eighteen still frail and sensitive spirited

evaritle galois

his serious face already had lines of bitter-
ness in it now these marks of frustration
deepened as he read the reply from the great
mathematician cauchy dear sir i am
sorry to report that the mathematics paper
you claim to have sent me is lost i beg
your forgiveness

lost two years of laborious composi-
  iix steps    seven steps    eight   
nine   

  the measured beat of this mental marvels
tragic life marched through his tormented
mind as he counted off the steps

  twenty-three steps   

  all last night he had worked feverishly
his mind bad worked with lightning insight
clearer than ever before he had worked out
and set down an algebraic principle unknown
to hundreds of great minds before him and
destined to be regarded with awe in the next
century for its sublime significance

  his great discovery was this split an un-
solvable algebraic equation into radicals
which arc roots of the equation if the radi-

cals are rational real not imaginary quan-
tities the equation is solvable if the radi-
cals are irrational nothing more can be
done the rule still holds to the present
day a century later

  the twenty-fourth step   

  on the twenty-fifth step at dawn of the
day of may   galois just  whirled
and fired a pistol the shot went wild but
that of his political adversary in the duel
on this field of honor struck a vital spot
evariste galois and his brilliant intellect
were no more

 thus died one of the most promising
mathematicians the world has ever seen
death hsd ended the equation of galois life
with a zero

mad about microbes

elie metchnikoff gazed ruefully at the telegram clutchcd in his hand
thousands of sheep were dead from his vaccine it informed him so he
was not the great bacteriological genius he thought himself his microbe serum
had killed-not cured metchnikoff was a failure

the zealous biologist stroked his majestic beard and scowled why was life
so full of disappointments his eyes glowed lambently as his thoughts whirled
him years into the past

born in russia he had attended the university of kharkoff a brilliant stu-
dent there far ahead of his class he wrote many technical papers reporting
his discoveries with the microscope for the -    	 	-

scientific journals of the day but they were
always rejected

  there was little science to learn in russia

elie metchnikoff

metchnikoff believed so he transferred to
the university of wurzburg in germany
there conditions became unbearable for
him his fellow students refused to asso-
ciate with him-he was a jew heartbroken
the young scientist went to italy from
italy he went to the island of heligoland
driven by a relentless spirit-the desire to
learn everything he could about microbes
-about how humanity could conquer the
menace of invisible germs-the jew wan-
dered

  and so it was for the indomitable pioneer

one crushing disappointment after another
at twenty-three he married four years
later his wife had died metchnikoff won-
dered if he should follow her

  but despite these adversities the scientist
toiled incessantly day and night he kept
his eyes glued to his microscope until they
were red-rimmed ready to fall out of their
sockets under his precious lens he
examined every organism known to science
germ culture tissues of muscle samples of
the blood he studied them all determined
to find one thing-the reason why certain
organisms were immune to disease he was
mad about microbes

  metchnikoff got up from his chair reached
for his favorite pipe he smiled wanly it
was pleasant to remember the brief years
of success that had followed

  in  at the age of forty-four as the
result of work on sponges and polyps he
had published an epoch-making memoir on
the intra-cellular digestion of invertebrates
these observations threw a bombshell into
the biological sanctums of learning met-
chnikoff had proved that individual cells of
sponges took in solid particles of food and
digested them in order to provide material
for the growth of the young and he told
how the amoebalike eggs of a polyp ate and
digested the neighboring follicular cells

  but what was most sensational were met-
chnikoffs observations on the laws of im-
munity-the problem that had puzzled him
for decades he established the fact that
certain wandering amoeboid cells attack in-
gest or absorb parts of the body which be-
come either useless or septic and thus harm-
ful to the organism and also microbes of
disease germ and the bacteria which have
entered a wound	turn page


proved that there are organisms in the body
whose sole function was to destroy any
alien organic matter that might be harmful
metchnikoff didnt know what to call these
destroying cclls that annihilated foreign
microbes but the greeks had a word for it
-phagocytes phagocytes is greek for de-
vouring cell

  and so had come success the people of
russia forgetting for a moment that met-
chnikoff waa jewish appointed him director
of a new institute tney wanted professor
metchnikoff to isolate phagocytes that
would destroy the disease microbes which
were killing off their cattle

  the fiery scientist had protested i am
only a theoretician  am overwhelmed with
researches-some one else mil have to be
trained to make vaccines to do the prac-
tical work

  but the people of russia wanted miracles
they had paid for the institute with their
hard-earned roubles and they demanded re-
sults metchnikoff was on the spot and
he was tired he had been studying too hard

  now metchnikoff drummed his fingers on
the surface of his desk yes he had made
a mistake he had gone off on a vacation
leaving the work of an anthrax vaccine to
his assistants and now the telegram told
him that it had failed terribly he knew
what that meant he was through at the
institute well at least he had tasted the
cup of success for a short time it was
sweet maybe-in the decades to come-
he would sip it again

  but metcnnikoh in his heart of hearts
wasnt so sure where would he go he was
old now he had numerous enemies all over
europe men who were envious of his dis-

	w ex-

 perimentation why couldnt all scientists
 be helpful to each other like the great pas-
 teur

   wait a minute  professor louis pasteur
 was head of the famous pasteur institute
 in paris metchnikoff had met the brilliant
 french scientist once would he remember
 him now would he give him a chance to
 work out his theories uninterrupted

   metchnikoff didnt know but he could
 hope so the jew who had wandered all
 over europe came to paris stood before
 the impressive entrance of the institute
 walked in and asked to see professor pas-
 teur

   a few minutes later the two giants of
 their day were standing side by side eyes
 locked the number one microbe hunter
 of the century was thrilled to see metchni-
 koff again he patted his bewildered fellow-
 cientist on the back and exclaimed enthu-
 siastically

   you may not only come to work in our
 laboratory but you shall have an entire
 laboratory to yourself i

    the world lifted from metchnikoffs shoul-
 ders his watery eyes became steady as he
 visioned the future    another chance to
 learn more about microbes to conquer the
 marauding hordes that menaced humanity

   history tells the rest metchnikoff did
 justify the great pasteurs faith in him in
 the years to come he battled with the micro-
 scopic foes of mankind isolated the causes
 of several diseases won mighty victories
 over them in  he was awarded the
 nobel prize

   the man who had failed many times was
 a success

death of a

wticolaus copernicus was d
 mers breath came in quick short
a grim race against death suddenly
that had spent a lifetime charting the
him who had come to watch him die

  with an inaudible sigh copernicus
shut ah they were good these men w
est scientists of the sixteenth century loyal
friendly colleagues in life they would
mourn his passing from the world there
had been times when he had argued bitterly
with each of them when they had claimed
he was a fool to believe in certain of hi
astronomical theories but he had been
firm in his convictions proof was what
they had wanted and proof was what he
had given them

  the astronomers pale shrunken face re-
laxed in a placid smile for centuries men
of science had accepted the doctrines of
ptolemaic astronomy ptolemy the egyp-
tian mathematician had declared that the
earth exists as a fixed body in the center of
the universe and that the heavens revolve
around it every twenty-four hours for the

star-gazer

ying the seventy-year old astrono-
gasps and his frail heart beat feebly in
his eyelids fluttered open and the eyes
cosmos roamed over the men before

sank back in his pillows his eyes now
ho stood before his bedside the great-

 next thirteen hundred years all the civilized
 world believed this during all that time it
 was thought that the sky was a solid vault
 turning round on a mighty axis fitted into
 sockets with the stars attached to the sur-
 face of the vault

   as a youth copernicus had read avidly
 alt he could of the old writers of astronomy
 and his keen mind saw that there was some-
 thing wrong in the conclusions ptolemy had
 reached night after night he would sit up
 in a tower and watch the stars pondering
 on their mysteries and every shred of evi-
 dence he collected took him farther and
 farther away from ptolemy and nearer to
 something quite new-quite unheard of-
 the movement of the earth around the sun
 he saw that the sun does rot circle the
earth but that the earth and the other
planets go around the sun

  but it was shocking to think such a thing
in those days all people held that god had
made our earth the center of the universe
that ours was the greatest and most im-
portant planet in the universe and that all
the heavens obediently attended meekly

nicolaus copernicus

whirling round and round us if it were be-
lieved that the earth were not the center of
the universe then some pioos men said the
importance of the earth disappeared that
was heresy the church claimed

  copernicus wrote a book to prove his
theory he knew the danger he ran and
feared to give his book to the world for
years he kept it by him secrotly and it waa
only after he had been stricken by paralysis

that he ventured to have it printed he
named it de kerohjtionibm oribium cowtes-
thim concerning the revolutions of the
heavenly bodies but would posterity
prove it accurate

  the aged scientists eyes flitted open once
more if only he could see a copy of his
book before he died then death would be
welcome for a moment copernicus fea-
tures grew stem as he remembered some-
thing andreas osiander a lutheran
preacher interested in astronomy and
mathematics had suggested that the book
be offered as a mere hypothesis bearing no
relation to the actual facts other than to
serve as a good working basis for calcula-
tions this way the church would not be
offended copernicus had scorned this pro-
posal he wanted the world to know the
truth

 the son sank low in the heavens and
copernicus felt his heart slowing down
death was but minutes away suddenly
there was a knock on the door it was a
messenger from the printer delivering the
very first copy of his book he thrust it
into the trembling hands of the dying
astronomer who had just enough strength
to scan its title page copernicus smiled
faintly attempted to turn a page his eyes
closed finally in death

  but copernicus had seen only the title
page of his book had he turned the first
page he would have discovered the treach-
ery of osiander disregarding copernicus
admonitions he had inserted a preface to
the work which stated that the book was
merely an interesting hypothesis no
name was signed to this prologue so that
readers assumed the astronomer had sought
to save his hide at the expense of truth

  but copernicus had died blissfully un-
aware of this deception

whos afraid of the big bad wolf not i said john stuart
as he started to paint the town red

i smashed the apparatus a it h i piece of pipe

the fear

neutralized

by edmond hamilton

author of mutiny on europa easy money rtc

ft  wear said dr bascom
impressively is the curse
m of the world

  he held up his lean finger in peda-
gogic fashion to emphasize his point
his small figure rigidly drawn up and
his eyes behind glittering glasses
austerely focused upon my face

  i hastened to utter an obsequious
yes sir and tried to look as atten-
tive and respectful as i could in-
wardly i was wishing i could get
away from the old bore and hunt up
helen his daughter but i was too
afraid of the irascible little scientist
to say so

  just look at this fear-ridden hu-

man race of ours exclaimed dr bas-
com all its happiness is thwarted
and poisoned by fear-fear of what
other people may think fear of the
future fear of the consequences of
every act

  think how happy everyone would
be if they did not have dread of some
kind in their minds all the time i tell
you the human race will never attain
any real progress or happiness john
until it has banished fear utterly from
its make-up

  thats right sir i hastily re-
sponded as he again paused rhetori-
cally i felt by then that i had over-
worked yes sir lately

los
the fear neutralizer



  dr bascoms voice lowered

  john  shall be the man who re-
leases the human race from the thrall
of fear

  you sir i repeated stupidly
my mind was really wondering
anxiously whether helen had not gone
out while i was eaged here

  yes i dr bascom said proudly
come here john and ill show you
what i have done

  he led me over to a table in the cor-
ner of the laboratory there was a
big cylindrical thing looming up be-
side the table shrouded in a canvas
cover but what caught my attention
was the mechanism on the table to
which the scientist was pointing be-
ing an insurance agent myself i
didnt make any sense out of the thing
it looked like a complicated electrical
apparatus shielded by a nickel cover
and with a copper helix spiral around
the outside of the cylindrical cover

  now watch this said dr bascom
importantly taking two wire cages
from underneath the table

  in one was an ordinary mouse in
the other was a fluffy smoke-colored
cat that i recognized as helens pet
persian i wondered if she knew her
father was experimenting with it

  dr bascom put the mouse into the
same cage as the cat the tiny rodent
shrank into a corner paralyzed with
dread the cat eyed it then flattened
down its tail beginning to switch

  you see said the little scientist
earnestly the mouse is in deadly fear
of the cat

  a remarkable experiment doctor
i congratulated him readily

  you blockhead that is not the
experiment he snapped everyone
knows that a mouse is afraid of a cat
but watch now

  he put the little cylindrical mech-
anism on top of the cage containing
the two animals he touched a switch
and the tiny mechanism gave off a
faint hum

  i watched then i was amazed to
see the mouse come out of the corner
into which dread had frozen it the
little rodent unconcernedly began to
wash itself with its paws

  then sniffing the floor of the cage
it walked across to the cat it sniffed

curiously at the persians paws and
around its flattened head the cat
seemed too petrified by sheer surprise
to make a pounce on the mouse for
the moment

  dr bascom reached in for the ro-
dent and put it back into its own cage
then he turned triumphantly to me
you saw what happened

  that mouse must have been drunk
or something i said i remember
reading a story once-

  no no the little scientist
stormed cant you see that it was
this apparatus of mine atop the cage
which neutralized the normal fears of
the mouse and made it utterly fear-
less of the cat it neutralized the
cats fears too but of course we didnt
notice any change because a cat isnt
afraid of a mouse anyway

  i stared at the little mechanism
you say that thing did it how
could it

  dr bascora smiled masterfully
that is my secret john but i dont
mind telling you the basic principle of
the thing fear john is an emotion
but what largely controls our emo-
tions the answer is-the ductless
glands physiologists have learned
during the last few decades that such
glands as the thyroid the pituitary
and others largely determine the men-
tal and emotional make-up of an ani-
mal by the amount of their secretions

  i have been studying the ductless
glands for years i discovered recent-
ly that one of them is definitely re-
sponsible through its secretions for
the emotion of fear in some people
that gland secretes freely and such
people are consequently always fear-
ful even cowardly in other people
the fear gland does not secrete so
much and people like that are un-
usually courageous

  i told myself bascom you are the
greatest scientist of the age for mak-
ing this discovery but you will be
even greater you will be the supreme
benefactor of the race if you can find
a way to stop the secretion of the
fear gland altogether  he was get-
ting excited by his own words now

  and i found that way john i
learned that a certain type of elec-
trical radiation has a completely in-


startling stories

hibiting effect upon that particular
gland that mechanism emits such
radiation any subject that i put
under the influence of the mechanism
will have its fear-secretions inhibited
will immediately lose all its fear
remarkable i told him but
how is it going to benefit the race
much to make mice brave with that
thing

  john you are a complete fool the
little scientist informed me angrily
this little apparatus is only a model
which i built to test the principle but
if i use a projector many times larger
capable of broadcasting the fear-neu-
tralizing radiation over a great area
capable of affecting all the people in
that area it will-

  he stopped suddenly irritated by
my uncomprehending stare

  i might as well be explaining to a
wooden post as to an idiot like you
he snapped get out of here before
i lose my temper

  yes sir i said more joyfully
than i had all the last half hour and
hastened out of the laboratory before
or bascom had time to change his
mind

 hastily searched through the
big country house for helen but
couldnt find her then i went out-
side and saw her practicing her serve
on the sunlit tennis court

  she saw me and came up to the ver-
anda swinging her racket and giving
me a mocking smile

  i thought you came out this after-
noon to see me she said

  i did i told her hastily but i got
to talking with your father and
couldnt get away

  poor john she mocked as she sat
down by me why didnt you sum-
mon up what spunk you have and tell
him you just werent interested

  i looked at helen bascom with
hungry hopeless admiration id been
in love with her for more than a year
but had never got up enough nerve to
tell her so there was something so
proud about her dark beauty some-
thing faintly scornful in her cool eyes
that had always awed me when i felt
like pouring out my admiration it
awed me now so i sat making inane

remarks about tennis and the weather

  then suddenly it happened and it
surprised me i swear as much as it
could have surprised anybody else i
could feel my ears burning and there
was a deep strong hum going through
my head but i suddenly put my arm
around helen and said calmly
come on babe slip us a kiss

  she was so utterly astounded that
for the moment she couldnt resist
before she knew it she was on my lap
and i kissed her-and what i mean i
kissed her

  i tell you she wasnt any more
astonished than i was yet for all my
astonishment i still wasnt the least
bit afraid of her any more i kissed
her again and made it even better

  then helens amazement passed
and to my increased stirprise she nes-
tled closer in my arms her eyes not
faintly scornful now but soft and
melting

  oh john she cooed im so glad
i was wrong about you

  huh i said what do you mean
wrong about me 

  she explained tenderly i always
was in love with you but i wouldnt
even admit it to myself i so hated the
thought of marrying a spineless rab-
bit of a man such as you appeared to
be but i see now that was all pre-
tense-that youre really beneath it
the kind of masterful man i want

  i laughed heartily at the thought of
me being a spineless rabbit why i
wasnt afraid of anything on earth 

  i pulled her to her feet and started
toward my roadster

come on kid were going to drive
in to town and get married right now
dont you think we ought to tell
father first helen asked hell be
pretty angry if we dont

  hell get over it i told her non-
chalantly and she laughed carefree
assent as she got into the car with me

  i was feeling great and i made that
roadster roar going into town we
hit seventy-five and eighty on the
stretches and went around the curves
on two wheels

  helens eyes sparkled with excite-
ment

  is this the fastest you can do she
asked over the roar of the wind
the fear neutralize

ill

  not by a long shot i called back
jamming the accelerator to the floor-
board hold tight gal

e zoomed down that concrete
road like a comet i almost
turned us over jerking the car around
a hay wagon and both helen and i
shouted with laughter at our narrow
escape

  to tell the truth at the back of my
mind i was surprised and puzzled by
my own recklessness for i had always
been one of the most careful of driv-
ers but now i got a big kick seeing
how nearly i could make the old crate
imitate an airplane

  every other driver on the road was
zipping along at the same suicidal
speed cars were racing each other
cutting crazily around each other and
taking the wildest chances we saw a
half dozen bad wrecks before we got
to town but they didnt bother us-
we were getting a thrill

  i drove into the city still making
sixty traffic was wild there cars ig-
noring stop lights and signs and col-
liding with each other at every corner
i headed joward the courthouse to get
our marriage license

  i had to jam on the brakes when i
came to a wreck that obstructed the
street a traffic cop who looked pretty
wild-eyed ran up to us and stuck his
head into my car

  you came down that street a mile a
minute he snarled have you driv-
ers all lost what little brains you bad

  who do you think youre talking
to ignatz i snapped

  and then i did something id often
secretly wanted to do i reached out
and gave that traffic cop my right fist
square in the jaw he toppled wildly
back

  helen giggled i thought nothing
more of it and calmly turned the car
and detoured around the wreck

  we parked a block from the court-
house and the first thing i saw was
the bulky figure of mr wilson my
boss coming along the street toward
us

  he had seen me and he was frown-
ing as black as thunder when he came
up to us

  what are you doing running

around town with a girl john
stuart he demanded i thought i
sent you out to look up that bedford
prospect

  that prospect can wait until i get
good and ready to see him i told my
boss coolly ive got important busi-
ness on hand

  important business he howled
you young fool your business is sell-
ing insurance and if you dont attend
to it ill fire you

  yu cant fire me i quit i
snapped and then ignored him
come on helen

  wilson stared after me with mouth
gaping as we moved away

  	that was a good job you just quit
wasnt it helen asked unconcern-
edly

  sure but ill get another-if i
want one i told her carelessly the
morrow will take care of itself
inside the courthouse the marriage
license clerk was just closing his win-
dow i pulled it open again

  come on hand out a license i di-
rected youre not supposed to close
for two hours yet

  so what he sneered i feel like
taking the afternoon off and im go-
ing to do it

  a license shrimp or ill come in
there and take your office and you
apart i told him ominously

  i didnt scare him a bit i must ad-
mit he was a withered pint-sized
little fellow with whom i could have
wiped up the floor but he just yawned
boredly at me as though he were an-
noyed by something  trifling and
flipped out a blank to me

  fill that in he told me scowling
and dont start getting tough or im
liable to hang a mouse on your eye

when we got out of there with
the license and started looking
for a preacher we found all kinds of
craziness going on in the street

  i noticed a small boy stop in front
of a candy store he eyed the tempt-
ing confections inside the plate glass
window and then nonchalantly broke
the window with hi ball bat and
helped himself

  a half dozen fist-fights were going
on along the street then we heard a


startling stories

commotion from a bank a block away
and in a few moments we learned that
two thugs had walked in there and
had coolly tried to rob the bank with
no weapons but their bare hands

 the police were dashing around
wildly and there were wrecks and
traffic snarls everywhere due to the
crazy driving and every time two
cars collided their drivers hopped out
and proceeded to stage a fist-fight be-
side the wreck

  a hulking fellow stopped beside us
and stared admiringly at helen

  youre some looker kid he told
her brazenly how about shaking
that creampuff and coming along with

  creampuff am i i snarled and
jumped at him he was a foot taller
than i but we were going at it ham-
mer and tongs in a second

  a cop ran up and tried to separate
us i gave him a push in the chest
and then socked my antagonist a
beauty right on the chin and he went
down for the count

  the cop id pushed over scrambled
up and i asked him belligerently

  well do you want to make some-
thing out of it

 aw everybody in town has gone
nuts he said disgustedly i quit
this darned job he tossed his badge
coolly into the gutter and walked
away

  i grabbed helens arm and we strug-
gled through the confusion o the
streets we spotted a church and in
the parsonage behind it we found the
scholarly elderly clergyman busy
writing at his desk

  cant be bothered marrying anyone
now he told me im busy writing
next weeks sermon

  his ascetic face lit with unholy joy
for twelve years ive wanted to tell
my congregation just what i think of
them but ive not dared he said
now ive decided to do it next
weeks sermon will make their ears
burn

  i finally prevailed on him to leave
the sermon long enough to marry
helen and me then delirious with
happiness we went back out into the
street and started to my parked car

 the city by now seemed to have

gone completely mad as helen and
i went on toward my car things
seemed getting wilder than ever
there were fights everywhere and
sounds of domestic dissension and
battle came to our ears from almost
every house we passed

  a newsboy was shouting his papers
and i bought one the editor had
slapped in a last-minute editorial in
big type on the front page

  this city is full of crooks he had
written and the mayor is one of the
biggest of them as for the owner of
this paper heres how he hushes
things up- and the editorial went
on to expose scandals about some of
the papers biggest advertisers

 helen clutched my arm and said
look john theres a riot going on
down at the auto plant

sure enough down there at the
end of the street we could see a
mob of surging men fighting in front
of the plant breaking clubs over each
others heads in a mad melee

  whats the riot about i asked a
man coming from that direction

  it seems the men are beating up
some of their bosses he told me
theres a few of them who have al-
ways been disliked but until now the
men were too afraid of their jobs to do
anything about it he laughed ill
say there doesnt seem to be much fear
on the part of anybody today im
going home now to tell my wife what
i think of her

  he walked on grinning but i had
stopped dead a sudden idea coming to
me from his comment about the gen-
eral absence of fear

 i was suddenly remembering dr
bascoms experiment with the fear
neutralizer on the mouse and was re-
membering the little scientists fur-
ther words which i had not heeded
at the time

  but if i use a projector many times
larger capable of broadcasting the
fear-neutralizing radiation over a
great area-

  that big canvas-covered mechan-
ism in the corner of dr bascoms lab-
oratory that must be just such a
larger projector i saw now and with
it the doctor had banished all normal
thetearnetttrattzer

th-

fear from an area that included this
city

  i remembered new too the deep
strong hum i had heard when helen
and i were sitting on the veranda
that was when the little scientist
must have turned on the projector

  and his fear neutralijer was wreck-
ing the city i saw at once that the
process should be stopped before this
town went completely crazy

  understand i was not the least bit
afraid of the consequences if it was
not stopped but my reason and my
sense of duty told me that i ought to
bring a halt to dr bascoms experi-
ment

  i told helen though i guess wed
better drive back out to your home
now we should tell your father
about our marriage

  all right john she said happily
and we got into the car

  it was dangerous business driving
out of town-not that the danger wor-
ried us any and once out on the
open road i let the car out again and
we hummed homeward faster than we
had come

  i left helen in the living room and
hastened back into her fathers labora-
tory it was just as id expected

  there in the corner stood a huge
cylindrical mechanism with a spiral
helix around it uncovered now hum-
ming away like the devil and destroy-
ing all fear for miles around

  dr bascom turned toward me he
had been mixing some chemicals to-
gether at a table

  hello john he said brightly
ive been enjoying myself-perform-
ing some risky experiments which i
was always afraid to try before

  youre an old fool i i told him
brutally wheres the switch of this
fear neutralizer

  then i found the switch myself and
turned the thing off for good meas-
ure i smashed up the apparatus with
blows from a piece of pipe helen
came running in and stood there look-
ing aghast i motioned her out of the
room imperiously and she meekly
obeyed

  what in the devil do you mean by
this the doctor demanded furiously

  that thing has nearly wrecked the

city already i told him it banished
all fear there just as you intended bit
instead of making people happy it
made them so reckless and foolhardy
that they would soon have destroyed
themselvat

and as i said that for the first
time the terror of what had hap-
pened and what might have happened
came home to me and made me trem-
ble

  good lord i said huskily shak-
ing with fear its a good thing i
thought to come back here

  the little doctor drew himself up
to blast me with words but i added
quickly

  youd better never make another
of these things and had better keep
mighty quiet about this onet if it
ever gets out that you causod all that
madness in the city today youll have
a thousand damge suits filed against
you

  hmm i said dr bascom frowning
thoughtfully at that

  perhaps you are right john he
said after a moment it may be after
all that fear while it sometimes makes
us miserable is really the mainspring
of the human race fear of the law
fear of the disapproval of others when
we commit mean actions fear of the
consequences of improvidence-

  that reminded me of something and
i exclaimed in dismay

  good lord my job i forgot that i
quit it

  i grabbed the telephone and called
my boss mr wilsons voice became
an angry roar when he learned who it

  you stuart he shouted what
do you want you impudent young
whippersnapper 

  i want to apologize for my insol-
ence this afternoon i said rapidly
i was a little out of my head i guess
and id like to have my job back

  he growled but said finally all
right you can have the job back i
wouldnt let you have it mind you if i
wasnt afraid that i couldnt find as
good a man as you for the place
im mighty glad youre afraid of
that then i said and when i hung
up i muttered thank god tor fear
startling stories

 dr bascom told me frowningly
john on the whole i think you are
right and that it will save me much
trouble if we say nothing to anyone at
all about my experiment

  as your son-in-law doctor you
can rely on me to preserve silence i
said quickly

  he turned a glittering angry eye on
me and i quailed inwardly for i was
now in as much awe of the irascible
little scientist as ever

 son-in-law hraph he said
well if you and helen are married
it cant be mended i suppose but get
out of my laboratory now-i have to
take this projector apart

  yes sir i exclaimed eagerly and
respectfully backed out of the labora-
tory

  helen was in the living room and

she was alarmed and worried as she
ran toward me

  john ive just realized what dread-
ful chances you took in driving so
recklessly and in starting fights with
all those men she exclaimed and
losing your temper that way with
father-smashing his apparatus i
guess i was too excited to be afraid
then but i am now

  she put her arms around my neck
and said earnestly

  john i want you to control this
reckless fearlessness of yours from
now on to keep it suppressed and hid-
den as you did formerly promise me
that youll do that for me

  her eyes were pleading i put on a
rueful look and said reluctantly

  itll be hard for me to control it
darling but ill do it-for you

measuring light

editor science question box

i know that professor albert a michelson has made the greatest contribution to
science in the way of measuring the speed of light i wonder if you can give me a
brief outline of his experiments and how michelson arrived at his calculations-e l
metuchen new jersey

  in s michelson began a series of experi-
ments which he repeated from time to time
with more and more precision over a period
of  years he used foucaults method with
improved apparatus and technique his later
experiments were carried out between jit
wilson and mt san antonio in eouthern cali-
fornia this cove him  round-trip of about
 miles instead of a rotating mirror made
of a single plane surface he used an octagonal
tucrrer the source of light was a powerful
arc

  when the rotating mirror was at rest the
returning beam ws reflected from a certain
face of the octagonal mirror then he would
spin his mirror until the returning beam was
reflected from the next face into the obeerv-
ine microscope obviously the light had trav-
eled  miles in the tlsne it took the mirror to
turn one-eighth of a revolution in his last
experiments he was unins a steel vacuum
tube a mile long located near santa ana
culitornia

  he found that the speed of light w vacuo
is  -f  kilometers per second or s-
   miles per second this is a most
important natural constant and in spite of
its difficulty it has been determined with rriore
precision than any other both foucault and
michelson measured the speed of light in wa-
ter and found it to be about the speed in
air also they feund that in free space in
vacuo j the speed of light is independent of
color

  tbe velocity of light is probably the most
fundamental constant in nature since it is the
velocity of all sorts of radiation light and
radio waves as well as of x rays and gamma
lays in the theory of electricity und mae-
netlsrn it cmes out that the value of the
ratio of the electromagnetic unit to the cor-
responding electrostatic unit is equal to the
velocity of light expressed in -centimeters per
second cx cmsec no velocity accord-
ing to our present theory can exceed this
velocity-ed

neighboring planets

editor science question box

  having sought in vain for a reasonable answer i am writing to you in the hope
that you will be able to give me a solution of the following problem

  it has been definitely established that the world and its companion planets are round
but the curve of the earths surface is so gradual it appears fiat so far so good but
let us suppose that a planet was attracted to this world and it stopped about twenty
feet above the surface now the following points trouble me

  -would the people on the other planet supposing it to have inhabitants be upside
down to us -would it be possible without suckers like a fly to cress from one
planet to another -if the force of gravity on each planet were equal would the
inhabitants be able to move about

  i have had several explanations some being that the surface of each world would
be revolving so fast that each planet would see no details of the other other people
say the whole idea is impossible and leave it at that perhaps you will be able to
help me-g w london england

                                                                i

they would speed toward each other at in-
creasing speed and crash probably destroy-
ing both

  there is not even the slightest possibil-
ity that they would stop when only twenty-
feet from each other it is like jumping off
the empire state building falling faster and
faster as you near the ground thousands ot

 those people who said that the whole idea
is impossible were nearest right but they did
not have to stop at that a planet could not
approach the earth and stop at twenty feet
from its surface any easier than you coaid
slide down the side of a rainbow the laws
of nature would not permit it if they came
close enough twithin thousands of miles

ey will garth

author of rays of blindnessgreat illusion etc

five of the men in the great room sat
quietly staring apprehensively at the
metal cylinder resting on the chromium
table the sixth man old harvey harris
stood by the window his eyes shut thought-
ful

  lean gray-haired dr samuels broke the
silence gentlemen he began his tones
crisp it has been two weeks since the dis-
appearance of our colleague hugo stone
stone is the worlds greatest expert on
atomics and it is a certainty that without
him we can never complete our machine for
delving to the center of the earth and

theyre asking a million dollars in radium
for his release-radium which we have but
which we need to drive our borer

  as dr samuels went on discussing the
kidnaping harvey harris scowled somberly
suppose it were he who had disappeared
would his associates be as gravely con-
cerned he wondered frowned he was
only a mathematician and could easily be
replaced he knew why he had been al-
lowed to work with the combine they
were sorry for him five years ago a
laboratory explosion had almost killed him
they had let him stay on sympathetic but
rarely had they given him any work

  harris shrugged his frail frame yes if
he had disappeared the only one who would
miss him would be his faithful assistant
connors understanding connors who
took all his dictation even read aloud to him
about the wonders of the heavens for
astronomy was harris hobby

  samuels was still speaking this cylinder
landed on earth yesterday its contents a
strip of movie film which proves that the
efforts of the interplanetary police are in
vain    that stone is captive on a space

ship past saturn how the kidnapers were
able to get out that far in two weeks i
dont know pursuit is hopeless for it would
take our fastest ship about a month to reach
that vicinity its bad news just when we
had a tip that stone was being held captive
on earths moon i

  as dr samuels motioned to an attendant
the lights dimmed and a movie projector
snapped on its image cast on the great white
walls first the men saw earth receding
in space then the familiar firmament
from the sound-track came the kidnapers
voice his tones disguised

  were nearing saturn  you can see
by the relative position of jupiter as seen
from titan one of saturns moons that we
have your man somewhere around here-
   then came a clse-up of stone his fea-
tures imploring

  thats right cried samuels you can
see several of saturns moons sweeping past
to the right like metal balls to a magnet
rhea tethys hyperion phoebe-did you
sec them all scoot by stone is out there
all right and wed better pay up

  but harvey harris interrupted i
wouldnt advise doing so samuels he said
quietly the police are probably right
and i wager theyll find stone on our own
moon examine that movie him closely
and youll discover its a clever fake manu-
factured with miniature models those pic-
tures were never taken in space

  what didnt we see the moons-
yes continued old harris but the
kidnapers made one mistake you said you
saw all the moons speeding in one direction
past titan but any astronomer will tell
you that nine of saturns moons revolve one
way normally but the tenth-phoebe-re-
volves in retrograde transit in the opposite
direction from the others our kidnapers
forgot that simple little iact saying so
harris reached for the door he smiled
wistfully to himself old was he use-
less thank god he knew his astronomy

  dr samuels turned to the other mem-
bers of his staff-
ironic men isnt it he said slowly
that we who have eyes didnt see what
harris-blind since that explosion-realized
in a moment maybe weve been blind for
five years

                                  michigan peninsula in  had his eye on

                                  banks collapsed like the hindenburg line

  in his amateur chemist days otto pro-
vided the family with thrills and excitement
once on a thanksgiving morning he blew
up half his apparatus but luckily neither
himself nor the turkey producing hydrogen
on another occasion he started a phospho-

smoke but gave himself a burn that took a
month healing since then he has gone the

time-traveling
by amelia reynolds long

  at last i believe in time travel for you cer-
tainly hove taken us back to the good old
days when science action had some real vis-
cera and before most of it had lost its won-
der through the sheer extravagance of
mechanical magnitudes and you have ac-
complished time travel in another way as
well for you have brought back to us a
writer who has passed out of time as we
know it

  the idea of scientlilctlons hall of fame
intrisu s me also hay i nominate for it
lawrence mannings -seeds prom space
it appeared in wonder stories back in those

sood old days i was just talking about and
y the way what has become of manning
has he straved from the scientific fold or is
ho only to be seen at long intervals like a
transit of venus

  now just one request if you plene when
razine for thriujnq
was firm spoken of i got
to use some weird mate-
rial would that be a possibility at pres-
ent there is on the market only one good
weird magazine and a spattering of publica-
tions which we buy in all innocence and then
hide under the cool pile in the cellar for fear
of what our family and friends would say
couldnt startling stories ub just otto
weird story in each issue

  in everyway your new magazine certainly
has made a debut with banners flying and
trumpets bounding but ill bet you the rim
of s doughnut against the thumb-spsce it en-
closes that you cabt keep that pace up its
just toe touch to expect however im hop-
ing furiously that i lose the bot- s

wells welles well

by p schuyler miller

  whynt you folk at startling stories
try to get orson welles script for the adapted
war of the worlds to ran us one of your
reprints of classics it shouldnt run to
more than short-story length and would be
a very famous and distinct novelty-the big-
gest thing since loakes -moon hoax as a
matter of fnct no critic these days can even
dare to claim that science fiction isnt taken
seriously

  lacking that let your galloping reporter
get interviews with the people who claim
they saw th martians land lacking both
of these circulate a letter from fans and
writers to mr welles complimenting him on
a swell job- so ten broeck st scotia

  i have never written to a magazine before
but i feel that at last i must any superla-
tives that  could use in describing suinley
g weinbaums the black flaino would
seem superficial i have read science fiction
for eight years but in all that time i have
never come across a more fascinating story

  my one hope is that yon will adhere to the
high standard that you have set for yourself
with your first issue of startling

  i salute you in the name of science fiction
for the perfect start a more liked or a bet-
ter known author could not have been repre-
sented ia the first isbuc of your magazine 
am eagerly awaiting the nest issue

  as to the pen ton and blake series ok but
keep carlyle and quade out at first they
were somewhat amusing but one gets tired
of the same characters after a time

the reprint question
by paul h spencer

    have just finished reading the flrat issue
 of startung stories and my impression
 in very favorable-xcept in the matter of
 size ifou practically promised ua the largo
 size you know oh well i suppose we cant
 have everything otherwise the magazine is
 really splendid cover illustrations stories
 departments and everything

   of course the black flame waa the best
 partly because it was the longest story and
 partly because it was eo well written-but
 mainly because it hnd a real well worked-out
 plot something you could really sink your
 teeth into boy what a yarn few s-f
 stories can approach it and it certainly in
 the best thing for quite some time con-
 gratulations on publishing it

   science island was rather well done but
 somehow i dont think the mad-scientist-at-
 tempts-conquet-of-world idea is any too
 original do you no more hack-work like
 this please

   scientlflctlons hall of faina is lust what
 rvo been waiting for-thanks i have read
 the eternal man previously but i was
 pleased to see it reprinted nevertheless i
 suggest for future reprints the city of
 sinking flame and its sequel by clark ash-
 ton smith how about it what i really

 want though are some book-iength re-
 prints the human termites the final
 war the broofl of helios etc im sure

 your other readers are nearly  in favor of

 such reprints and  urge you to take a vote
 on the question

 the various departments are very interest-

 ing and add greatly to the magazines appeal

                             nnub

 novels tomorrow and otbere or which i

  in conclusion i urge you to obtain for fu-
  ture issues some of john talnes unpublished

 have heard im sure your readers would
 welcome them

   well keep up the good work-new york
 city

   thanks for your suggestions for reprints
 in our hail of fame but long stories are
 definitely out we cannot undertake to re-
 publish anything longer than live thousand
 words in length-ed

  startling stories and the black
flame sure were worth waiting for the
former waa a wonder of completeness the
latter was perhaps the greatest science fic-
tion story  have yet read my only com-
plaint is that you did not inclnde weinbaums
bust in your cut for sctentlflctlons hall of

   incidentally my nomination for your hall
 of fame reprint is a martian odyssey
 and the merits of my nominee need no elabo-

why cant you
write

 its much simpler than you thinki

 co many people with the germ of writing
 in them simply cant get started they
 suffer from inertia or they set up imaginary
 barriers to taking the first step

    many are convinced the field is confined to
 persons gifted with the genius for writing
 few realize that the great bulk of commer-
 cial writing ia done by so-called unknowns
 not only do these thousands of men and women
 produce most of the fiction published but
 countless articles on business affairs social
 matters domestic science etc as well

    such material is in constant demand every
 week thousands of checks for   and 
 go out to writers whose latent ability was per-
 haps no greater than yours

the practical method

 to write is by writing newspaper copy-deak editors
 waste no time on theories or ancient dailies the slory is

the thine every copy cub goes through the coarse of

  practical criticijm- training that tarns out more suc-
  cessful authors than any other experience

 that is why newspaper institute of america bases ha
 writing instruction on the copydesk method it starts and
 keeps yon writing in ypur own home on your own time

      upon the very un kind of actual asmtmmenlt givwt
 daily to metropolitan reporters thu you learn by doing
 not by studying the individual styles of model authors

    each week your work is anatyitd eonmtruetiveiy by prac-
 tical newspaper men gradually they help to clarify your
 own dirtnetire style writing soon becomes y tb-
 orwjyj profitable too as you gain the professional
 touch that gels your materiel accepted by editors above
 all you can see constant progress week by week as your
 faults are correctd and your writing ability grows

 you have natural talent for writing it will analyse your
 powers of observation your imagination and dramatic

 tribute to weinbaum
 by walter e marconette

   though the letters x write to professional
 magazines are few and very far between if i
 remember rightly the last was in  i
 feel that startling stories simply must
 receive some sort of comment or rather
 the comment is due not exactly to the maga-
 zine itself but to weinbaums magnificent
 novel the black fiame

   if startling stories never again pub-
 lishes a worthwhile story in its lifetime
 though im sore it will it would still de-
 serve a generous slice of glory for publish-
 ing this novel for the stories of stanley g
 weinbaum are truly a legacy tliey will live
 forever with lovers of fantastic fiction

   and of all his works tht black plamo
 is easily the best its swiftly moving pan-
 orama of a strange new world its marvelous
 characterizations its crackling dialogue its
 thrilling detail-all this bespeaks but one
 thing greatness-dayton ohio

 how do you like finlays
  work

 by james v tauras

   i thought the black flame one of the
 best stories of the year it offered me many
 hours of good reading if future complete
 novels live up to the standard of this story
 youll not have to worry about selling star-
 tling stories the wesso illustrations
 for thie story were excellent i liked espe-
 cially the small cuts showing the chaructors
 in the story the reprint story was also
 good as for a tuture reprint how about
 weinbaums first yarn the martian odys-
 sey

    binders yarn was so-so not good not bad
 the departments were all good i liked the
 tribute to weinbaum by otto binder very
 much cover was also good but rd like it
 better if it had illustrated the black flame

   keep up the good work-flushing mew

immortal anton york
by frank bryan jr

  i	have just finished reading your magazine
and it maets with my full approval i have
wished for auite a while to read a magazine
that would nave at least one long novel i
have only been reading science fiction for a
shrt while ajd so have nt read all of the
older novels by weinbaum and others i
think it would be very nice if you printed
a martian odysaey once more

  as for future issues a novel concerning the
exploits of the penton and blake boys should
be good- the quade-carlyle feud should also
present possibilities for an excellent novel

after waiting an entire month for a large
size format i was certainly let down on see-
ing the familiar small size again i forgot
all about format however when i plunged
into the black flame nothing i coaid
possibly say could do justice to weinbaums

re not found its equal in the two years i

worthy was the classic short the eternal
