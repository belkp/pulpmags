t-he wear-polished floor planking
  hes not a bad looking kid merry
mason said to the sheriff neither
way in appearance nor character
hes got that same lean face his dad
had i mean and a good strong body
and if you didnt know him and saw
him on the street youd never say
there was a wild one
  sheriff barton keller didnt take
his gaze out of the street he shifted
the toothpick with his tongue from
one corner of his mouth to the other
and his pale left eye went wall-eyed
in a peculiar way it had it was almost
as dark as night in here in the store
or so it looked to you after youd
glanced into the mid-morning au-
gust-sun-blasted extra-wide dust-
moted main street
  dont matter how they look its
what they do keller said indif-
ferently in his always almost in-
audible voice
  oh of course but its funny isnt
it standing behind the counter
mason wiped the palm of one
wrinkled hand once across the sur-
face of it
  he shouldnt ve got mixed up
with the naren boys keller said
after a silence
  no i know merry mason sucked
a deep quick sigh its too bad for
his mother shes a fine woman
alby foster was a good man
 i know i know fine parents-
and they turn out like that what
happens to them
  sheriff barton keller shrugged
the toothpick shifting again as his
gaze came back into the store hey
i need a sack of durham he said
he screwed up his face working with
his thick fingers at the string of the
tobacco theyre sayin charlie
landry is headin this way
 charlie landry the elderly
storekeepers ears were tuned to the
sheriffs indolent voice but he re-
peated interesting items in his own
lively accents as a means of confirm-
ing that hed heard right what
would he be wanting here
  what does he ever want keller
tugged the durham bag shut again
with his teeth another notch on his
gun
 but who in this town would he
consider a notch certainly fern
norens boasting about his gun-skill
hasnt won the attention of so em-
inent a one as charlie landry
sheriff barton keller squinted his
eyes up pulling a long inhale on his
cigarette
  maybe hes just ridin through
he said finally
  well lets hope so merry mason
said
 i his was not just an ordinarily
pretty girl janice wells was
chewing in anger the inside of her
lower lip but even the distortion this
brought could not take from the
flawless perfection for example of
her soft red cupids-bow mouth she
was not amused was the trouble at
sight of dick foster drawing a bead
on a tincan hed placed on the wells
corral fence
  what id like to know janice
was saying is what in heavens name
has got into you lately every time
you come over here you have a new
gun with you im telling you daddy
doesnt like it nor whats more to
the point do i
  the - crashed and the tincan
took a trip dick foster squinted
sourly
  this was my old mans gun he
said giving no sign of considera-
tion of janices speech pulling his
horse to him and dumping the win-
chester back in the saddle scabbard
he hiked up his extra-wide cartridge
belt joulled askew by the weight of
the big holstered  and met her
furious regard squarely its not
much good
  how very interesting
  whats the matter arent you in-
terested in guns he said after a
minute
  she put little fists at her slender
waist and her creamy-tanned elbows
jutted
  if you knew how silly you looked
with all those guns hanging all over
you- honestly
  you didnt say i looked silly last
night his tone remained flat hi-s
delivery delayed
  last night i liked you and i
kissed you today i wouldnt kiss
you for the world
  dick foster cracked his face with
a broad grin
thb wild tm

  ill bet you would
  janice wells lowered her head and
her shoulder-length shiny dark hair
fell in a curtain dick foster looked
at it and his eye dropped to her bare
ankles and he suddenly took her in
his arms and he kissed her at length
when she threw her hair back and put
her face up a moment before she
was the responsible woman that she
was on the threshold at eighteen of
becoming now she was the teen-age
girl again swept by puppy love
  hey she pushed free finally and
murmured huskily you shouldnt
do that out here in broad daylight
she cleared her throat
  i shouldnt eh he said in a voice
that was no less husky
  no you shouldnt
 janice no more than dick had
noticed her father coming from the
house neither of them heard him
even when he was upon them so
that it was like a bolt of lightning
when he smashed a big hand down on
dicks shoulder spun him and
slapped his other hand full-open and
hard across dicks mouth
  ive had enough of your antics
young man george wells said in a
voice that was as terrible as it was
soft now you get on your horse
and ride out of here and dont come
back until youve learned some man-
ners
  dick foster ran the tip of his
tongue across his bleeding lower lip
and the tongue and lip trembled he
kept his eyes fastened on george
wells for what began to look like a
foolishly long time for janices fa-
ther had turned to her saying youd
better get on up to the house jan-
ice
 she was watching dick foster
worriedly and she in her turn
couldnt seem to pull her eyes from
him not even when her fatner took
her arm to start her
  ill kill you for that mr wells
dick foster said very quietly
  thats the kind of remark id ex-
pect from you george wells said
thats a highly intelligent state-
ment lets go janice
  oh dad you shouldnt have done
that- she moaned
sitting his staring-tired lath-
ered horse charlie landry raised
his face to the bky and sniffed the
air then he screwed up his face
sourly it meant nothing in partic-
ular charlie landry was a tough
merciless conceited young man and
he was full of such mannerisms they
grew out of his restless self-suf-
ficiency they were the sick flower
of the insatiable craving that crawled
him to show off
  charlie landry had done a lot of
showing off in the two blazing years
since a lad of seventeen hed risked
drawing with a notorious notch-hunt-
er and bested the fellow the element
of surprise had done it here and his
victory had been neat and easy there
had been shoot-outs since that had
been neither neat nor easy death
had taken a couple healthy swipes at
charlie landry but without touching
him and his confidence had swelled
with each new cut on his glossy gun-
butt until he was hard now to beat
nervousness no longer stiffened his
fingers as it more and more did
those of the ambitious hellions who
had their try at him
  charlie landry was a legend and
he knew it at nineteen a kid of
nineteen is not able to carry fame too
gracefully
  here on the edge of the vast un-
known hell that was the northern
half of texas charlie landry made
his arrogant decision murder in the
course of a bank robbery was among
his achievements now and with a
virtual ranger army on his backtrail
he might wisely have risked the
danger and drought of the high
plains where warlike indians ruled
and what little brackish water was to
be found was undrinkable for even
the rangers never went beyond this
point obviously figuring that an out-
law chased north of here was a dead
outlaw anyway
  but such drab practicality did not
appeal to charlie landry the hell
with laying low for a few weeks
with indians breathing down his
neck and nothing to eat and alkali
salts flavoring his water what the
hell he could probably take on a
dozen rangers in a stand-in-the-street
showdown charlie cracked a match
into flame with his thumbnail to punc-
tuate this decision tilted his head
and pulled his mouth up askew put-
ting match to quirley

satisfied little smile ho yanked his
palominos head around and contin-

ttes the boy id like to put
   a it on fern noren said even
standing with his feet set wide apart
fern noren was a full six-feet-five
a beanpole of a young man and his
head had the same long slender loo
as his body his two kid brothers
hunkered on the other side of the
campfire had the same typical noren
face narrow fishy-eyed under curly
blond hair
  what the hells he headed this
way for hunk noren growled
  posy noren wrinkled his eyes in a
snaggle-toothed grin up at the eldest
brother
  hes after old fern
  fern norens little eyes flickered
in the firelight and he sawed a long
forefinger under his nose self-con-
sciously
  wish to hell he was
  what the hells got your lip but-
toned foster hunk noren abruptly
flung over a shoulder at dick who
was sitting on a small boulder back
a way from the fire staring steadily
at it
  just not feeling talkative thats
all
  he jest aint feelin talkative
where you get that high-falutin gab
foster-from that wells gal
  shes got him wore out posy
said
  the hell with it dick foster
said
  tough tonight
  hes tough every night aint you
dicky boy posy grinned
  maybe hes the one ought to take
on charlie landry fern noren said
without humor glaring at dick fost-
er fern considered himself top man
in this bunch and his pigheaded
brain inflamed quickly and easily
  posy noren wasnt any better en-
dowed with gray matter than fern
but he seemed to be because he
grinned and joked a lot hunk was
between his brothers in age and
temperament
  yeah foster how bout that
hunk said past a toothpick he was
maneuvering
  hey i thought we come out here
to talk about slow-elkin some of that
nice fat star ranch beef posy
noren said
  fern noren sawed the long fore-
finger under the limp nose again
  mebbe we oughta wait until laun-
drys took care of he said
  hunk squinted at him whatre
you say in fern
 whats it sound like fern
snapped
  you thinkin of bracin charlie
landry
  why the hell not fern growled
posy grinned at him a big wide
grin no kiddin fern boy
 five minutes later hunk noren
shoved up and said well he aint
cornin out here lookin for us lets
get the hell into town you ridin
with us foster
  dick said why the hell not
  posy was still wearing the big grin
unhobbling the horses dick boys
thinkin he might be takin a crack
at charlie landry himself aint you 
dicky boy
  ed spooner had been alby fosters
one hired hand while alby was alive
a lanky bachelor who you couldnt
rightly estimate was he forty or
seventy he had that ageless dried-up
kind of skin and wiry build that
never tell of the passage of time-
ed spooner had stayed on when
pneumonia took alby the past winter
 i cant pay you ed martha
foster had said frankly to him
  youre payin me ed said im
eatin reglar and i got a roof over
my head
  what neither of them had said was
that with spooners help dick foster
could have kept the little -spread
operating as well as his dad had the
boy was old enough now
this night though ed spooner
did finally mention dick spooner
had kept his fingers crossed he fig-
ured every lad worth his salt sowed a
few wild oats before he put his shoul-
der to lifes day-in-day-out grind he
figured that if dick didnt get killed
first or saddled with a sizeable prison
sentence hed turn out all right
 this night ed spooner spoke to
dicks mother about him because this
day spooner had heard that charlie
the wild time

landry was in the neighborhood
  at first they were sayin in town
that he was just ridin this way and
would like as not ride right on
through spooner told martha fos-
ter but now they say the rangers
are combin this section for landry
and that hes apt to hole-up in town
for a spell thats what they do when
it gets hot theres places to hide in
a town they can get food and liquor
they can fort up if necessary they
can take hostages
  so what i meant was-if we could
somehow keep dick out of town for
a few days-it might be a good idea
these young-uns get ideas when
they first get handy with a gun they
figure they can take on jesse james
martha foster dropped her sewing
in her lap and she put tired eyes on
spooner the glow from the table
lamp deepening the circles under
them
  hes his own boss now ed she
said softly he would never stay
away from town if i asked him to
and he wont take the work serious-
ly-
  he aint a bad boy mrs foster
he aint nearly as disrespectful as
you think young-uns act that way
at his age them with any get-up-and-
go in them especially you wait
dickll be all right
  if some charlie landry doesnt
kill him first
  ed spooner came up from taking
a long sip of coffee from his saucer
into which he always ceremoniously
emptied his cup with his head on
one side
  thats what we got to keep from
happenin he said so what i fig-
ured mrs foster youll have to play-
act like youre sick spooners eyes
went as round as his saucer with the
daring of this unaccustomed conniv-
ance waiting for her reaction
  but martha foster shook her head
i doubt if even that would keep
dick here ed i-im not sure that
he really-loves me any more-
sure he does he just acts like he
dont like i told you deep-down he
loves you same as ever youll see
so what i figured was-id ride into
town and see if i can find him and
while im gone you hop into bed with
a hot compress on your head spoon-
ers eyes went still wider with this
imaginative scheming yeah
  martha foster had to laugh at that
then she shook her head and her eyes
were moist when she said youre
very sweet ed and ill never forget
your-
  i aint sweet i just want to keep
young dick in one piece sos when
he gets over his growin pains he can
take up where his daddy left off sos
i can start gettin my pay reglar
again he added with a twinkle in
his eye
unrhat animal could stand
-i- some attention son the white-
haired hostler finally made himself
say to charlie landry
  like everybody else in town hed
been frozen into slow-motion ever
since the word had flashed about an
hour past sunset that the notorious
young killer was riding in but no
man who loved horseflesh could have
stood to look very long at landrys
beaten mount and not spoken up in
its defense
  sitting the shiny sweat-wet palo-
mino indifferently where hed let it
come to a stop halfway along the
main street charlie landry put his
gaze on the aged liveryman while
the town waited breathless
  landry said as though he hadnt
heard the hostlers words whats
the town all lit up for old man
the street was indeed for a tues-
day night inordinately illuminated
with the swaths of yellow light that
extended from the saloon the em-
porium the hotel the livery the law
office the restaurant blended by a
full moon into an effect almost re-
sembling daylight not of course
actually like daylight rather like a
stage-set denoting it with a tension
about it such as one feels in the weird
glow that precedes a tornado
  it aint lit up specially the
liveryman said
  whats it lit up for me or for the
rangers
  the liveryman frowned what
rangers
  the rangers that are on my tail
fifteen of em big tough texas
rangers i sat that hill you got out
there and i watched em cornin may-

-gun western
be theres only ten of them but it
looked more like fifteen what do
you think of that old man
  the street was as quiet as if there
werent a soul up and down its
length so that charlie landrys
voice rang out clear and sharp like
how a voice sounds on a still cold
night seeing sheriff barton keller
standing between the law office and
the store and the noren boys and
dick foster on the saloon veranda
and ed spooner beside his horse
where hed stepped down at the res-
taurant hitchrack you would have
done a double-take on them for you
wouldnt have believed that so many
people could be there without any
of them making any kind of a sound
  i said what do you think of that
old man
  the liveryman muttered grudging-
ly i dont think nothing of it
well maybe youll think some-
thing of it when i fort up in your
stinking stable and shoot it out with
all them big tough rangers because
right now thats what im thinking
of doing old man and then not only
my horse but all your horses too
would get my attention because like
as not id fort right up behind them
  because them big tough rangers
wouldnt want to mow down all them
pretty ponies to get at me and that
way i could be mowing the ranger
boys down instead while they made
up their minds
  then charlie landry put his pale
eyes on the group on the saloon
porch he might have been a good-
looking kid except for those color-
less eyes though it was hard to tell
any more whether their cold dead
look was a result of a lack of pig-
mentation or lack of any shred of
warmth behind them
  it was difficult in fact to note
much less remember any other detail
of charlie landrys face than his
eyes they were him they and the
lightning-fast gunhand they seemed
to get bigger if you could stand to
look straight into them until they
fascinated you hypnotized you even
landrys flashy attire even the
jewel-studded black flat-crowned
stetson and the purple silk shirt
with fancy white embroidery on one
of the two breast pockets did not
make the impression on you that the
eyes did
  who are the quiet little boys
lined up on the veranda there
charlie landry said then one of
his s was suddenly glinting in his
right hand and he was blistering the
saloon with bullets so that the noren
boys and dick foster had all they
could do to dive onto the planking
in time to escape the fusillade
  theyre yellow little boys i see
charlie landry said deliberately
reloading his gun which is the
sheriff he said a moment later
you fella he addressed barton
keller
  the lawman stood as though fro-
zen his eyes wide on landry his
hands flat on his belly moving un-
comfortably as though he didnt
know what to do with them
  hey here come them rangers
old man said amiably then to the
hostler for the gentle thud of hoofs
had begun to sound on the still night
air dry night like tonight sound
aint carryin far so theyll be cornin
in right quick right old man
the hostler having been
standing stiff suddenly grabbed a
shotgun from behind a doorpost and
was squeezing the triggers before he
had the weapon lined this was why
he had little success but it was at
the same time the only reason he had
any success at all charlie landry
had expected such a move but char-
lie landry didnt blow the top of an
old mans head off in a hurried man-
ner there were times you needed to
be fast putting it on an old man was
not one of them that was how-come
charlie landrys left arm got
brushed by the shotgun blast hed
timed his draw for a split-second
later
  damn you he snarled feeling
the slugs rip his arm the first taste
charlie landry had ever had of hot
lead and in unleashed fury he emp-
tied his gun into the already dead
body from which life had been torn
by his first bullet
  sheriff barton keller went for his
gun then stepping out onto the
boardwalk but the rangers were
sweeping into town in this same
moment and charlie landry had
the wild time

wheeled his horses viciously and
swung off and into the cover of the
livery he ripped off his left sleeve
and when he saw all the bleeding
holes he swore violently again and
slammed his empty gun at the crum-
pled form of the hostler
  then charlie landrys bloodshot
pale eyes flicked wildly in the direc-
tion of the rangers who were step-
ping down in front of the livery with
drawn guns amid the yelling and
pointing of townsmen and charlie
landry palmed his left-side gun and
as promised started yanking the
horses out of their stalls so that they
became a multi-layered barricade
between him and the rangers
  the horses remained an adjunct to
charlie landrys stand but briefly
however landrys near-hysteria evi-
dently spread to the animals and as
the excitement outside rose as well
they started moving one in fact
suddenly reared and one of its paw-
ing hooves caught landrys already
tortured left shoulder charlie lan-
drys profanity was purple at this
and he wasted another bullet by
smashing it at the horses head
  which only served to compound
his difficulties because the animal
screamed before it died and the other
horses really started getting out of
hand then
  the bullets indeed that the light-
ning-fast young gunman used on the
old liveryman and the horses became
ironically the only effective ones he
got in during this his greatest show-
down for the stampeding horses
caused him to have to abandon shoot-
ing at the rangers in the street sent
him desperately to the rear door o
the stable
  and by the time he got the door
yanked open four rangers had sped
back there between the livery and the
next building and were waiting with
lined and levered sixguns and -s
so that charlie landry was literally
blown to hell before his fabulous
trigger-finger could react even in-
stinctively 
sometimes ed spooner not only
put his head on one side when he
poured his coffee from his cup into
his saucer but also arched the little
finger of his pouring hand he did
this on very special occasions he did
it this morning at breakfast with mrs
foster and dick spooner had had
after all to do all the talking mrs
foster was obviously too nervous to
talk and dick had simply eaten his
bacon and eggs in silence
  dick did though answer the re-
marks ed spooner addressed to him
with each of which mrs foster be-
came more and more worried and his
answers were notable
  man them rangers really give it
to him didnt they though dick
they did yes
 funny charlie landry the
toughest of them all i dont reckon
there ever was a kid slicker with a
gun than him do you reckon dick
no i doubt if there ever was
an they lay him out jest as neat
as a pin
  i know 
  you got to be low to shoot down
an old man an treat a horse like he
done you know it
  you sure do 
  what dick foster replied to janice
wells was well worth mention too
when she swept into the dooryard
and slid off her horse and said breath-
lessly at once to dick
  i know daddy will be furious but
i had to see you and see how you
were i heard that-that charlie
landry shot at you before they-
he shot at me all right dick
said with a weary little grin and
what i did was dive for the floor with
my heart in my mouth
  oh but you werent-
  no i wasnt hit look janice ill
ride back with you because i want to
apologize to your father and on the
way i think i could do a little
apologizing to you too
  standing in the bright sunshine in
the doorway beside ed spooner
watching dick and janice ride out
mrs foster suddenly put a hand to
eds arm for support because her
knees were shaking so she thought
they might give way on her it was
possibly a let-down from all the ter-
rible tension but more likely it was
a reaction to dicks having kissed
her before he swung up on his
horse	end
thou shalt not kill
by ellis
dorn rode out of the pass at
noon a tall man whose angular
face bore the weather-honed
mark of long years a-saddle yet whose
brown eyes were kindly in all ari-
zona territory there wasnt a circuit-
riding minister who rode so wide a
loop or had hung his hat in so many
back-trail places
  here the land fell away before him
broken with ravines and dark pine
reaches threaded with the quicksilver
sloan
 of a small winding river sweeping
 downward toward the valley of the
there were times dorn
thought when he was
tempted to forget the
words in the good book
when he longed to use
the six-gun on his hip
then gruber
was upon dorn
battering him
with blows
tkou shalt not kill

rio gato and midway in the tumbled
hills stood an adobe hut the house of
his friend emanuel rodriguez
  dorn smiled and prodded his reluc-
tant mare along the trail it was a
year now since hed seen rodri-
guez 
  when he swung down in the yard
dorn found the mexican waiting to
greet him rodriguez has aged the
preacher thought when they shook
hands his round face though smil-
ing looked tired and careworn i
dig no longer for the silver the old
man said presently as they sat remi-
niscing maybe soon i go back to
sonora
  and leave the mine
  rodriguez nodded it is sad se-
nor his eyes swung wistfully to-
ward the dark opening in an outcrop
of rock yonder
  dorn was silent thinking hed miss
this old man beside him rodriguez
had no greed for the silver he took
from the earth but he loved the dig-
ging dorn reached for his pocket
perhaps a small stake enough sos
a man could keep going-
  warmth kindled in the mexicans
eyes it is not money i need senor
he looked down at his gnarled brown
hands raised them painfully a man
cannot dig with his hands full of mis-
ery it is the water in the tunnel-al-
ways water i can do nothing about
it
  watching the old man as he pre-
pared a meal of frijoles the preacher
couldnt help noticing the pain on his
face the halting motions of his hands
dorn decided then that when he got
to junction at the head of the valley
hed have a talk with doc weather-
stone and see what the medico could
do for rodriguez
  an hour later reining in beside the
rio gato the preacher sat his horse
and stared at the rivers sun-baked
mud dry he muttered wondering-
ly in all his years meandering up and
down the territory he couldnt re-
call when mountain water hadnt kept
the rio gato full and running it was
a thing hed taken for granted
  dorft wheeled his horse and jogged
up-river reflecting on the will of
god rodriguez giving up his mine
because it flooded with water-while
here the rio gato ran dry and ranch-
ers in the valley faced ruin which-
ever way a man rode there was trou-
ble
  he prodded the mare to a faster
pace along the trail this trouble was
man-made it occurred to him now
his eyes scanned the burned river
bottom thered been enough rain in
the hills according to rodriguez
then coming to a clearing he saw
the wall of rough-hewn timbers
stretching sovidly from bank to bank
and beyond the flash of sun-lit wat-
er so the rio gato had been damned
as he suspected
  he went on past the clearing here
backwater from the dam had risen
flooding the trail he took to the
brush and rode around it it was a
short time later as the mare rounded
a bend in the river that dorn peer-
ing ahead saw the woman standing in
front of the cabin
  in her hands she held a rifle but
as he came close she put it down the
preacher tufned into the yard and
reining up said softly you wont
need that winchester maam surely
you remember the riding minister
 dorn the woman was young
when she smiled its been quite a
while since you came this way
preacher
  dorn looked down at her she was
straight-backed and slender in a ging-
ham dress her chestnut hair drawn to
the nape of her neck glinting golden
in the sunlight but it was the fine
wide set of her face the preacher re-
flected that would make any man re-
member  sorry to hear about your
husband he said presently johan-
son was a good man and god-loving
  the womans glance swept the un-
finished cabin the bare yard with its
line of broken fencing john did
what he could to build a homestead
itd take a gunslick to hold out
against miles gruber once he start-
ed land-grabbing
  dorn eyed the winchester is that
why youre holding the rifle he
asked
  this place stands in the way of
miles plans for his diversion dam
the widow said bitterly does that
answer your question

-gun western
  so it was gruber dammed the riv-
er the preacher frowned he peered
yonder at the hollow slope of the
hills and remembering the backwater
on the trail said now he wants your
land to flood with backwater
 the widow nodded my husband
died in the brush with a bullet in his
back over a year ago miles has come
here ever since offering to buy the
place- she smiled he even offered
to marry me gruber doesnt know
what love is she said coloring late-
ly hes started threatening me-
hoof-tromp sounded in the yard and
she added morosely here he is
now
  dorn looked up to see gruber rid-
ing toward them he turned to the
widow if you dont mind maam
ill give the mare some water he
swung from saddle
gruber reined up beside the
widow and swept off his hat with
a flourish fine day his shrewd
eyes took in the preacher i reckon
its generally known im courting the
widow but its a little early for you
preacher he laughed what are you
doing here
  dorn said softly its time you
stopped bothering mrs johanson
gruber
  gruber sat the saddle a big man
and florid his face grown suddenly
livid with anger he glanced at the
widow then back at the man beside
her why you damned tramp par-
son he roared ill have you run out
of the country
  he wheeled his horse dangerously
close to the widow johanson i
didnt expect youd have company
maam he said angrily ill be back
tomorrow one of these days youll
think better of my offer spurring
his gelding he galloped from the
yard
  the widow stood looking after him
despair in her eyes she turned to
face the preacher gruber means ill
sell or be flooded out she said the
backwater from his dam is rising 
dorn let his horse drink from the
pail he said mounting im stop-
ping in junction mrs johanson
theres a lawman there will take care
of gruber-
  the widow laughed bitterly evar
hear of a paper sheriff preacher
this isnt the only place gruber it
after the ranchers have called a
meeting tonight in junction
her voice trailed off
  ill be there dorn looked at th
woman thoughtfully if the sheriff
wont stop gruber-
 the widow touched his arm and
there was a softness in her eyes as
she looked at him dorn had removed
his low-crowned hat and the brown
hand holding it was strong and gentle
a good man like johanson she
shook her head keep out of this
preacher things are worse below
the dam gruber wants the whole val-
ley
  there were times dorn thought
when he was tempted to forget the
words in the good book when he
longed to use the six-gun on his hip
that he carried for rattlesnakes but
he was a man of god thou shall not
kill
  now as his mares hoofs beat a
hollow tattoo across the wooden
bridge at the edge of town dorn won-
dered at how things had changed
since hed last ridden into junction
  coming up the rio gato hes seen
the results of grubers thrust for
power things are worse below the
dam the widow had said a land of
starved ranchers and dead cattle
had gruber taken over the town as
he had the river
  passing stockmans hall and the
mercantile dorn was about to swing
down in front of the hotel when he
remembered the medicine he wanted
for rodriguez tired as he was he
rode to the far end of town and
called on doc weatherstone
  the ruddy-faced little medico lis-
tened then shook his head rheuma-
tism he pronounced regardless
the old manll have to stop his dig-
ging he sat for a moment his bright
eyes studying the preacher whistling
tunelessly then he hurried into his
dispensary returning he handed
dorn a bottle according to my
label itll cure anything he laughed
as he shook hands with the preacher
 riding back down main street
dorn left the tired mare at the livery-
stable tomorrow ill see what i can
thou shalt not kill

do about the widow the preacher
thought as he toted his war bag to-
ward the star hotel
  what with gruber and trouble in
the valley it didnt look like hed get
much time for preaching dorn re-
flected morosely somehow the beau-
tiful sermons he thought up while
riding between towns always got lost
once he reached his destination
  at the hotel he took a room and ate
a late supper
  darkness shrouded junction by the
time he started for the ranchers
meeting at stockmans hall dorn
went along the boardwalk past lamp-
lit saloons and storefronts-aware of
an unnatural quiet that pervaded main
street
  ranch wagons were drawn up as
though deserted in front of the mer-
cantile a scattering of saddle mounts
stood at hitchracks further down the
street somewhere in the shadows a
horse nickered the soft sound carry-
ing clearly through the night air
  i can feel it dorn thought the
warnings near-voiceless were unmis-
takable gruber had stolen the river-
and written his own law in junction
but not for long for gruber had a
valley of angry men against him to-
night at stockmans hall thered be
trouble 
cittes too smart to meet with
  a a us a rancher said angrily
he knows were here for a show-
down
  dorn stood at the rear of stock-
mans hall his eyes studying the taut
faces of the ranchers as they sat dis-
cussing gruber a man with red hair
and a gaunt face got to his feet
  what none of you figure he said
thickly is that well be too late with
the civil suit we got pending against
gruber for damming the river itll
take another month of court-wran-
glin anyway and meantime gruber
can have any spread in the valley to
hell with talk my cows are dying
lets blast gruber the dirty land-
grabbing son well tear down his
dam-
  wait a minute men sheriff ben-
son spoke from the edge of the circle
any shooting and youll have the
law on your hands
  a thin smile creased the redheads
hard mouth you aint done nothin
so far sheriff while grubers been
starving us out of the valley turn-
ing his back he said to the others
are you riding with me against gru-
ber or do i go alone
  im with you hannigan one of
the ranchers said loudly a growl of
approval rose from the others
  dorn moved forward into the lamp-
light gruber has a tough crew be-
hind him he said slowly begin
and therell be more than one killing
his glance singled out young johnny
hackett standing in shadow i sup-
pose youll be riding too johnny i
came to junction expecting to marry
you his glance travelled the circle
you men should think of your wom-
enfolk before you start a range war
  johnny hackett spoke up you
dont rightly belong here preachfy
he said respectfully i aint marryin
beth-my place is wiped out his
voice shook with emotion leave us
alone well settle with gruber
there was a rumble of agreement
from the ranchers and the meeting
scattered men pushing past the
preacher toward the doorway meet
in front of the hotel before daylight
the red-haired man called well ride
to box-g and give gruber a surprise
party
there was nothing he could do
dorn thought grimly as later he
sat staring from the window of his
room at the hotel
  main street was still ablaze with
lamplight a crowd of people stood in
front of the hotel talking in low tones
of the morning raid on box-g gruber
would be ready theyre waiting the
preacher thought waiting for the kill-
ing to begin
  hed placed the lamp on the com-
mode near his chair and for a time
tried to read from the bible now the
book lay open on his knees his fin-
gers riffling absently through its dog-
eared pages
  by noon tomorrow thered be hell
along the rio gato and no way he
could stop it dorn thought sadly he
wouldnt be able to help the widow
johanson you dont rightly belong
here preacher johnny hackett had

-gun western
told him maybe johnny was right in
the morning hed ride from town
down-valley hed take the medicine to
rodriguez and go back over the pass
to yuma his fingers moved to close
the bible
 a page had come loose and he
looked down meaning to put it back
in place out of habit he started read-
ing
 -and thy rod wherewith thou
smotest the river
take in thy hand and go
the river the rio gato wound
out of the hills above rodriguezs
place-and rodriguezs mine was
flooding with water dorn read the
next verse his heart pounding
behold thou shalt smite the rock
and there shall come water out of it
that the people may drink 
  it was all there in the bible
minutes later dorn came hurry-
ing out of the mercantile a paper
bundle in his arms and called to john-
ny hackett whod just swung down
in front of the empire saloon
  johnny led his gelding across main
street sorry for what i said at the
meeting preacher that talk about
me and beth-
 you want to marry beth dont
you johnny youd rather save your
spread than fight gruber and his out-
fit
 i reckon so johnny eyed the
preacher curiously what you got
there preacher dont look like
groceries-
 dynamite dorn said softly
get back on that horse johnny
youre riding for me tonight fast-
and careful
gruber stood massive his back to
the dam his feet planted in the
dawn-lit clearing his crew was
spread out behind him except for a
few who stood guard on the opposite
bank of the narrow river
 box-gs owner smiled i dont
scare easy he said to the ranchers
who sat their horses before him his
hand hovered above his holster you
want to be the first to move hanni-
gan
  the red-head swore he turned to
the men beside him keep listening
to the preacher here and youll all
turn yellow
  he couldnt delay any longer dorn
was thinking maybe he had heard
the explosion riding down-valley
with the ranchers-but he couldnt be
sure hed been too worried about
johnnys ever reaching rodriguez
hard-riding with his saddle bsgs
stuffed with dynamite  dorn swung
from saddle and walked toward gru-
ber
  stop where you are preacher
gruber barked hed drawn his gun
his glance flicked over the ranchers
his will commanding
  dorn unbuckled his gun-belt and let
it drop to the ground i dont think
youll pull the trigger now gruber-
thatd be murder he went forward
slowly until he could see the grey
hairs in grubers stubble of beard the
tiny beads of perspiration that stood
on his forehead besides theres
something i want to show you
  dorn went to the edge of the dam
picked up a stick and thrust it in the
water with his knife he notched the
stick where it reached the surface he
turned to gruber the mexicans call
it cat river you know gruber you
never can tell which way a catll
jump he swung to face the
ranchers give me five more minutes
before you start shooting
  out of the way preacher hanni-
gan warned were not waitin-
time dorn thought minutes and
he might avert a range war he turned
again to gruber an answer forming as
he spoke you thought you had a
river-maybe a whole valley he
laughed its going to be tough grub-
er watching your dam go empty
grubers solid face worked with
suspicion you lie preacher but if
youve done anything to that river
you damned sneaking-
  you wouldnt talk like that with-
out a gun in your hand dorn
taunted gruber out-weighed him by
thirty pounds of solid brawn he was
thinking dorn straightened as the
rancher dropped his gun-belt to the
ground then gruber was coming to-
ward him charging like a maddened
bull his fists swinging
  dorn raised his arms warding off
the avage fury of those first sledge-
thou shalt not kill

like blows while he waited for an
opening when it came he swung a
hard right to the side of grubers
head the blow spun gruber around
a look of astoniskment on his beefy
face a growl came from the ranchers
hit him preacher one of them
yelled lustily
 dorns glance flicked over the
horseman hannigan sat unmoving
theyll watch while it lasts the
preacher thought grimly suddenly
gruber rushed him and this time the
ranchers driven fist struck with an
impact that resounded in his skull
like thunder dorn fell sprawling
  gruber was upon him in a second
his huge fists pounding battering him
with blows to the head and shoulders
dorn struck back realizing he fought
a losing battle but he fought for
time the sky wheeled crazily be-
fore his eyes
  in desperation he grasped gruber
by the arms and planting a knee in
his belly heaved upward gruber fell
sideways and they grappled rolling
on the ground near the dam
  they broke apart and dorn came up
on one knee and remained there try-
ing to clear his vision when he saw
gruber coming toward him the
rancher kicked viciously at his face
dorn grabbed the boot and twisted
gruber toppled swearing as he fell
 tired dorn took the moment to
stagger to his feet some of his blows
had told on gruber he thought with
satisfaction as the rancher rose and
came toward him there was blood
on grubers cheeks and his eyes had
the look of murder im going to kill
you preacher he muttered thickly
  dorn stood still waiting now for
the chance he knew would come-for
gruber in his rage had become reck-
less even as the rancher swung dorn
stepped inside the wide arching blow
and brought up his fist against the
side of grubers head with a crack
that resounded in the clearing the
blow knocked the heavy man off-bal-
ance and gruber was that way his
head back his jaw out-thrust-when
the preachers last blow hit him
  dorn stood for a moment looking
down at gruber hearing only dimly
the clamor of voices around him then
he walked to the edge of the dam
where hes left the notched stick
when he swung to face the ranchers
there was a slow smile spreading on
the preachers face youve no reason
to fight now he said get gruber
over here and ill prove it  it was
then that he heard the beat of hoofs
and turning saw johnny hackett
come pounding into the clearing
 johnny swung down from his
lathered gelding and walked ovef to
the sky-pilot you should have seen
it preacher he said panting i
strung that dynamite in the minehead
like you said when she blew me and
old rodriguez had to run like jack-
rabbits to keep from getting drown-
ded why that theres the purtiest
little river you ever did see runnin
straight into the valley
old rodriguez didnt really
need the medicine dorn reflected
now as he prodded the reluctant mare
back over the pass toward yuma
  when hed waved good-bye rodri-
guez had been bending over his new
vegetable garden beside the river
happily digging working in the sun
rodriguezs gnarled hands had lost
the misery dorn chuckled now that
the old mexican was something of a
celebrity hed changed his plans about
going back to sonora
  all in all dorn allowed it had
been a pretty fair trip over if he
lived to be a hundred hed never for-
get the dumfounded expression on
grubers face while water fell away
from the notched stick-or the look
in the widow johansons eyes as she
stood in her yard and saw the back-
water from grubers dam receding
  a fair trip what with beth and
johnny hacketts wedding and the
way the widow johanson had smiled
at him afterwards when shed said
goodbye get along girl the
preacher said gruffly he prodded
the drooping mare
  a fine woman the widow dorn
reflected the kind that would make
some lonely man downright happy
maybe someday soon hed come back
this way and just call on the widow
johanson social-like maybe some-
day in the spring 
  the preacher rode on over the
pass	 end
as fast as
they came
by harry harrison kroll
as-sir bub i toted that
thar shootin arn through
four year of trouble the
old man said reminiscently i done
looked through them sights at many
a damyank
  long sam his boy leaned on the
musket in question nodding absently
for hed heard ths tale a good many
times his squinted eyes had caught
a solitary wagon through the cotton-
woods on the far bank of the river
  no-sir that thar aint no ordinary
musket bub pappy dodds went on
  totes a slug the size of a buck-
eye
  you said it hits rifle air bored
and hit are twelve
inches longern the
average
  and if you pint
it in the right di-
rection and let fly
itll knock a dam-
yank out of a tree
a mile away
 bub you know
it by heart or a
dam injun
 wagon edging
in on the fur
bank
  let er edge and
be hanged im a
weary man
 you was born
so pappy though i own you was a
good soldier theys hollering for the
ferry
  let em holler mebby if we wait
a spell two wagons will come along
and well make two dollars instead of
just one
  the ferry lay tied to a willow the
water lapped at its crude sides pleas-
antly the air was slumbrous the
sun hung low round and red through
the afternoon haze and dust the mule
that operated the treadmill which in
turn navigated the primitive ferry
stirred and stamped to get the horse-
flies off its rump except for the
shouting wagoner across the river
there was hardly a sound
  well pappy lets set the boat
over no need of the feller ripping out
the roots o his tongue traveling by
hisself he might be in a hurry
  hes likely some polecat from that
wagon train we sot over yesterday
likely got too big for his - britches
and decided hed go alone well them
pawnees will make a good angel out
of him
  languidly father and son manned
the ferry one took one side oar the
other the other and the mule began
his grind they turned the boat and
   
to the raiding in-
dians it looked like
two old men an
old woman a
green kid and a
spooked girl they
didnt see pappys
shootin arn
   
headed across the
river at the tran-
quil rate of a mile
in two hours they
arrived at the land-
ing
 long sam in-
spected the offerings there was a
big lumbering wagon pulled by a
span of fleabitten mules and a spare
team led behind a milk cow with dry
bag was attached by a lead-rope a
tired calf bawled at the cows tail
  the freight on the wagon consisted
of some battered pieces of furniture
rolls of bedding a large wood box of
provisions and at the hind end a big
crate with a sow and pigs the sow be-
ing old and the pigs new and higher
up a crate of chickens mostly two
hens and a rooster and maybe a duck
and still higher on the load was a big
the old man
was a
crack shot

as fast as they came

lumpy old woman ambushed under a
slat bonnet-and what really caught
long sams roving eye a girl-
  by gums a gal
 he couldnt see much of her
though she was so disguised in lye-
faded homespun the general color of
the dusty western soil what curves
she might reasonably have had by
virtue of her youth were hopelessly
shrouded in loose calico and her
young face was barricaded by the
slats of a bonnet twin-cousin to her
mar she did have a pair of bright
brown eyes whose curiosity not even
the past weary miles subdued and
with these she peered down at long
sam while he peered up trying to
find what he had here in all this
shrubbery of old clothes
  the head man of this outfit was
travel-stained and tobacco juice ran
down the edges of his mouth and dis-
colored his scraggly beard
  you been a long enough time get-
ting acrost this unmellow creature
growled
  yap said pappy i had all the
rest of my life
  i been in a bigger rush than that
the man stated
  pappy shrugged some as is in a
rush and some as aint i aint now
men the boy air hyar well sot you
acrost the usual price is a dollar in
gold but seeing as you air so bad-tem-
pered about hit the price air two
dollars
  you are a damn-robber said the
man
i can tell by your talk you air a
damyank and thats the same thing
while this colloquy took place
pappy leaned on his sharpshooters
rifle placid and immovable
  before ill be held up ill stay on
this side
 shore pappy said he waved
lots of territory on this side red-
skins too
  by judas ill swim the river
shore aint nobody stopping you
only they is some sucks out yan and
treacherous waters and instead of get-
ting to the fur side you mout just
drift down to hades which is full of
the likes of ye a mess of em i sont
thar myself with this hyar he patted
the gun
the emigrant glowered his
thin blue eyes smouldering with a
soldiers well-remembered wrath
  i reckon i sent some of your
brethern to the same place-at shiloh
at chattanooga and a few other
spots
  shiloh chattanoogy i war thar
neighbor at chattanoogy i sot on a
rocky crag and tuck aim with this
hyar and he again patted his rifle
and shot down at a row of dam-
yanks and know what it was like
shootin a roost of scrooch-owels off
a dead limb
  pa the girl pleaded in a low but
huskily musical voice pay the man
the price and lets be set across
  the old woman put in her mouth
you fit the wars enough times now
latch your jaw and lets go where we
aim to go
  shut up the man told his women-
folks whos skinning this skunk
whoever is its making a mighty
stink the girl said
  ill slap yur teeth down your
throat her father stated
  long sam grinned looks like the
civil wars fixing to bust out in the
yankee family
  the man glowered but he seemed
to give in i reckon ill have to pay
you two dollars
  cross my palm with gold mister
pappy held out his hand
  i reckon you dont trust me
nope i dont trust yankees paw-
nees half-breeds stray dogs and gam-
blers he kept his hand extended
  reluctantly the traveler reached
into his jeans extracted a coin  pappy
bit down on it to make sure and nod-
ded for long sam to man the broad-
horn all the while long sam and the
girl had been eyeing each other
  once the ferry was in motion the
northerner inquired hows lands out
there he waved to the west
  maybe moren you seen back whur
you come from pappy said
  hows the redskins
  you ort to stayed with your wagon
train now you may lose your hair
pappy jerked his head toward the
womenfolks some brave will keep
your gal and theyll shore take the
hair of that old woman of yourn
  i guess i can take care of my own

-gun western
the yankee said but his voice didnt
have much assurance in it
 pappy shrugged and worked the
oar long sam had a device with
which he manipulated the sweep and
his oar and the mule all at the same
time the horseflies were terrible
the travelers teams stamped and
lashed with their tails the hot dry
air seemed to swirl in eddies above the
water the more humid it got the
more one could hardly breathe it far
up at the headwaters there had been
heavy rains but none had come this
way only the dirty swill in the river
 long sam talked between move-
ments of the broadhorn whats your
name 
  betty
  whats his name he pointed in
the direction of her father
  sol mcmasters
 where you ones headed any-
wheres in particular
  oregon california-wherever that
is pas hard-hardheaded cant make
up his mind all the time fussing with
people hes right good-hearted but
since the war he aint been himself
long sam nodded toward the
slowly approaching fringe of wil-
lows good land thar as anywheres
i aint been to the other end of the
world but fars i been it looks about
the same you ones mout settle nigh
about
  maybe
  how you look without that thar
durn bonnet
  she took it off shook her brown
curls out and gave him a starry smile
 by gum long sam said ill
holp talk your old man into settling
besides itd be a pity for the injuns
to scalp you longs folks travel in
trains they dont pester let one two
three tackle the trace and a dozen or
twenty pounce on em and thats the
last of that outfit
 how come they dont get you
folks
  long sam indicated the shooting
iron they seen pappy use that tool
the talk of the ex-warriors drifted
to them ill tell you that chicka-
maugy she shore were one ripsnorter
of a battle  by judas i tell you
for a little wed of licked the britches
off ye by dams for a little mori
and apt as not you wouldnt be
hyar nor you
  long sam shrugged grinned its
that way evertime some the veterans
of the wars drift through now its a
cornfed and they laugh and holler
then hits a yank and they paw up
the earth like a couple bulls
  many folks a-passing through
they come from yan pointing
back and go yan pointing ahead
droves and droves and droves you
wouldnt know they was that many
folks in this world all wanting to get
someplace they aint
  i wouldnt mind staying betty
said
  far up the river long sams keen
eyes saw something dark lying against
the fringe of willows pappy he
said
 whut
  looky yan his voice was low he
pointed the old man looked he
rubbed his eyes
  i dont see nothin
  hits a canoe
  naw hits a drift log
 long sam kept looking betty
looked the stranger stared the old
woman didnt want to look she was
too scared but she looked anyhow
whispering hoarsely injuns
  hits a bullboat and they hid in the
willers
  mout could be pappy admitted
my eyes aint as pert as they used to
be when i could knock a yank out of
a tree a mile away
  what kind of weepins you tote
stranger long sam asked the
yankee
  the kind what i killed me a mess
of rebs with-musket and pistols and
a couple blades forged out of scythes
i heard tell the buffalo grass was
tough and made em specially to
whack grass
  wheres they at
  down in the wagon body
  haul em out
 the old woman moaned i dont
want to see no injun fighting
 we dont neither pappy said
grimly but that aint fixing to help
none if hit comes on
  they watched what they had seen
hidden in the willows and it was only
as fast as they came

a moment or two before long sams
report was verified the boat shoved
from its covert and headed into the
fast water it came swiftly handled
by two rowers one an indian in the
stern stripped to his waist and noth-
ing else but a loin cloth the other in
the bow wearing buckskin and hick-
ory he also wore a hat at this dis-
tance he seemed more like a white
than a redman
  whuts that they got in the boat
looks like a mess of wilier
branches
  and so it did-long limber willow
limbs with the leaves still fresh cover-
ing a mysterious cargo
  shes a bullboat all right shore as
sour apples pappy admitted
  a bullboat was a type of canoe not
too often used by indians it was
made by bending a very tough kind
of wood hickory yew if it could be
obtained or splint oak for ribs and
then by running a light tough keel
along the bottom and the same kind
of wood around the tops of the ribs
as a gunwale over this serviceable
skeleton buffalo hides would be
stretched when the hides cured over
the cedar resin calking the bullboat
was light water-tight and swift
  by this time the canoe had come
within hail
  cody drifted over the water
  cody hell pappy said
  cody friend
  thats that half-breed long sam
said his pappy was a mormon mis-
sionary or something
  wouldnt trust the likes of him
with the life of a dead mule pappy
said you ones come down off the
load
long sam helped betty down and
took his time liking the chore the
old woman got so flustered her foot
slipped and her fat leg got hung up in
the sows crate she began to yell like
something possessed its chawing
off my leg then she realized the
word was indelicate and changed it
limb
  pappy was calling back to the half-
breed come no nigher cody whats
your business
  cody trade
  cody trade what
  cody trade buffalo meat he ges-
tured toward the cargo concealed un-
der the willow boughs
  dont you trust him pappy long
sam said theys injuns under them
wilier branches
  whar you get buffalo meat
hadnt been a buffalo sighted in
weeks
  cody made a gesture toward the
headwaters
  tell your mammy to stop her
squalling a body cant hear himself
cuss long sam said to betty mean-
while he was busy the yankee had
laid out his rifle his pistols and the
scythe blades
  now hand down that thar front of
the bedstead long sam said
  the yank put that off the load the
woman kept yelling the tread mule
understood the racket as a signal to
pause the boat now was drifting
down the current cody and his cargo
were coming nigher pappy kept up a
parley
  lay down on your belly long
sam told betty know what to do
with a shootin arn
  you shoot it
  take one yur pappys pistols but
dont waste no lead till we know for
sure
  he had got the bedstead between
the wagon and the side of the ferry-
boat it made a good barricade the
horseflies and the old womans squalls
had the hitched mules nervous and
the lead team was tugging at their
halters
  long sam took pappys rifle and
bellied alongside betty until he could
sight upon cody and the bullboat un-
der the bedstead it wasnt much of an
ambush but it was better than none
  dont shoot till i give the word
pappy said low we dont want to
start nothin after all the half-
breed might be friendly
  it was just this element of doubt
that always made it so dangerous
long sam could have killed either the
indian or cody but if those willows
covered a half dozen warriors and
their guns that would only start the
battle
  his eyes lifted and he searched the
shoreline from whence had come the
bullboat this time there was no
doult it was a typical indian canoe

-gun western
and it had as many as ten braves in it
aint no use waiting pappy
how
  i say haint no use loitering
theys another boat load of em wait-
ing up the river
  the divil ye say
  long sam did not wait for the order
to fire seconds now were too pre-
cious to waste he let fly with the
shooting iron that toted a slug the
size of a buckeye that pappy had
done notable carnage with it was
loaded with a round ball not like the
mine ball and wadded it with a
double charge of powder pappy had
worked out the logistics of it him-
self at the instant of explosion the
soft ball mushroomed and filled the
barrel when it issued it was twirl-
ing at great speed and when it hit
it did considerable damage
 pappy emitted a blood-curdling
groan you missed him bub
 which long sam had but the
yank all his battle blood roiled by the
unfinished fight hed had with an old
enemy now had something he could
take out his hate on his shot knocked
the indian in the stern into the river
then up out of the willow wood rose
the hidden braves they poured a
deadly fire into the ferryboat
  long sam saw the bullets splinter
through the bedstead over his head
the redskins hadnt had too much
time to take aim but they laid out a
a rear mule and crippled one of the
lead mules and the beasts plunged
the treadmill brute reared tried to
jump out of his stall got his leg hung
in the planks and plunged about
whinnying piteously
  gimme that thar weepin pappy
snarled
  he snatched it from his sons hand
he reloaded with the skill of an an-
cient warrior he knew how to use a
wagon for cover the yankee knew
what he was doing too he muttered
been laying all my time to kill me a
mess of injuns
  long sam was engaged in grabbing
the bridles of the snorting plunging
mules and keeping them from drag-
ging wagon cargo old woman and
squealing sow and pigs into the river
it was a mans-sized chore but he
watched the bullboat and the warrior
canoe a quarter mile up the river
he bullboat was sinking the
indians became aware of their di-
lemma as the yank knocked codys
brains out there now were six of
them nothing was left but to swim
some clung to the boat which as soon
as they got out of it still floated
pappy took one neatly through the
head the yank took another neatly
the same way you could count em
off-four now and they were agitated
like wasps when you stick a flame into
their nest
  they hadnt quite figured on this
to them it looked like two old men
an old woman a young squirt of a boy
and a scared girl now they were try-
ing to save their guns unable to shoot
now they were in the river and at the
same time save their hides
 but reinforcements were moving
swiftly to their relief
 thar they come pappy long
sam yelled
  a rifle ball whizzed past his ears
too close to ease his headache lay
low he told betty with ten fresh
ones on hand the redskins might man-
age to board the ferryboat likely
they figured the junk on the wagon
worth the risk some of the trashiest
of these emigrants carried gold no
doubt they had also sighted the young
girl such booty always stirred the
braves to their greatest efforts
  no use shooting at the canoe long
sam realized it was a log hollowed
out with fire and hatchets you
couldnt sink the thing here they
came knowing what they were going
up against the indians moved des-
perately into the task confronting
them pappy knocked one down and
the yank knocked one down i ipv
reloaded and the yank reloaded and
they let fly and now there were seven
braves capable of fighting
  but the canoe was only a dozen
lengths away the mules were raising
cain long sam reached for the scythe
blade the redskins were shooting but
it took them time to reload also they
were lying low in the canoe doing
their chores with apt fingers
  here they come long sam yelled
again and the indians shot their war
canoe right up against the ferryboat
strangely enough the old woman on
as fast as they came

top of the feather mattress made no
sound dead long sam figured
  an indian grabbed the edge of the
boat to pull himself aboard his knife
in his teeth long sam laid a nice
swish with the scythe blade and cut
off his hand betty was shooting
point-blank with the pistols pappy
and the yankee had reloaded and
fired again
 long sam did then what he had
planned all along if it came to that
he laid the flat side of the blade on
the rump of the mule that had been
bucking the worst cut the leather
trace and the beast jumped off the
side of the boat into the water then
long sam belted the other mule and
it snatched the wagon and tumbled it
onto the indian canoe long sam
whacking rapidly at traces and tie
ropes to free this animal and the led
mules and the cow and calf
 such a milling around long sam
never dreamed of four mules and the
cattle churning the river redskins
trying to get out from under the wag-
on wagon swimming cows and
mules canoe and ferryboat by this
time had drifted down the river far
past the landing an indian who
hadnt died given up or swum away
and who still had his gun shot at
pappy long sam saw pappy grow
limp the yank killed the indian
betty was still lying on her belly
pistol in hand long sam discovered
blood running out of him over his
clothes and stared at it in wonder
  he decided he would stay alive long
enough to get the treadmill mules leg
undone and see if it would be possi-
ble to navigate the ferryboat back up
the river by warping and poling the
yank examined pappy
  i seen em hit worsen that and
live to fight another day bub he
said to long sam im one of em
but hes sorter bunged up at that
  he stood and looked in all direc-
tions by judas wheres my old
woman
  shes gone paw betty said
  gone where	
  but he knew
  long sam pulled off his shirt he
saw something that looked like a rib
sticking out betty pushed it back in
bound him in bandages she didnt
bawl she helped long john and her
father warp the boat back to the land-
ing tie it up strangely the sun was
still shining all this had happened
not in a lifetime but in moments-and
not too many even of them fifteen
twenty at the outside
  the yank said im going after
my cows and my mules and my wag-
on i cant go west without them
betty helped long john up the rise
to the shack the yank toted pappy
up and put him in the bed saying
ill be back soons i get my animals
ma was gone so were the hogs and
chickens betty said to her father
with a weary kind of finality pa
im not going west no farther im
going to stay right here this is far
enough toward the setting sun for
me
  a snort of rum raised long sams
hopes of his life
  i didnt miss that half-breed cody
betty he said
  you didnt you didnt hit him
i shot at the waterline of the bull-
boat i knew if it was loaded with red-
skins it would sink and that would
give us a chance to pick em off
betty patted his cheek you go to
sleep i knew you were as good a shot
as pa or your pappy
  he took her hand you fixing to
stay
  its a hard thing to say but pa
probably aint going west now where
there aint any women hell likely
stay here and wait till some show up
but thatll be long enough for me and
you
  long john sank away into a rum-
my coma loading and firing pappys
shootin arm and knocking em dead
as fast as they came	 end
its a little weapon but since
its birth over  years ago it
has grown to be the greatest kil-
ler of them all its been called the
great equalizer because it makes
little men big and big men afraid and
today its voice thunders throughout
the world
  its as american as buffalo bill
or teddy roosevelt or ike eisen-
hower its an international as the
united nations the perseverance of
one man-his indomitable faith in his
invention-brought it into being and
to the last century it was as im-
portant a discovery as the a-bomb is
to ours the man and his brainchild
altered the course of world history
they caused wars and prevented
them the man was samuel colt and
his weapon-the colt repeating
pistol

spin against a
piece of iron thus
causing a spark
or by the flintlock
where a piece of
flint struck a piece
of steel when the
hammer was re-
leased these
methods had been
used on muskets
 contrary to
most opinions the
colt is not held
only in the hand of
the law although
it is standard issue
in almost all law
enforcement agen-
cies and commis-
sioned officer

tured annually by

ford con n at
least  per cent
are used by sports-
men not only in
competition on the

for actual hunting
and as an auxiliary
arm where beasts
come large and
dangerous how-
ever although the
colt today has
peaceful missions
tnat
tide for texas
built for the army taken
over by the gunslingers
the great equalizer is
still knocking over every-
to
as well as deadly ones there was no
peace in either the history of the
weapon itself or in the life of the man
who created it
  samuel colt was only  years old
in  when he was presented with
a legal document by andrew jackson
giving him the basic patent for a re-
volving pistol the idea wasnt new
but he was the first to have the skill
to put the various pieces together
and make them work
  the first single-shot pistol was
made in pistola italy in  it was
a hand-held pipe with a large hole at
one end and a smaller one at the
other the measured gunpowder was
poured through the large hole and
then the lead bullet was seated cn
top of it a flame applied to the small
hole ignited the powder
the flame could be supplied by a
piece of rope soaked in saltpeter
which was ignited or by a wheel lock
which was wound
up and released to

sam colts killer

and were applicable to the hand-held
weapon
  gunsmiths before colts time had
tried to perfect a revolving cylinder
that would give a soldier multiple
shots but each design was far too
complicated using the ignition meth-
ods just mentioned many of them
did work at least in principle but
werent reliable enough to become
popular especially when a mans life
was at stake the same was true of the
pepperbox the term applied to the
multi-barreled pistol which had a
number of barrels made to revolve in
front of the hammer the advent of
percussion ignition gave colt his im-
petus
  the percussion cap was a small
metal cup with a primer chemical in
its base it was fitted over a nipple
in the rear of the breech when the
hammer was snapped on the cap the
primer flashed through a hole drilled
in the nipple and leading to the
powder chamber
  colt saw its possibilites immediate-
ly and based his revolving-breech-
block rifles and pistols on its use but
he had a fight for recognition on his
hands his only customer at the time
could be the united states military
and they never accepted the percus-
sion cap ignition even on muskets
until after the war with mexico in
-almost  years after the cap
had been perfected
  no one knows exactly how colt be-
came interested in firearms perhaps
it was a combination of his inventive
spirit he also made an underwater
bomb-which didnt go off-and
later a submarine mine-which did
and the fact that he was forced to
leave amherst academy when he was
 for shooting off a firearm an act
strictly forbidden by the school
  sam colt had gotten his charter
from new jersey in  and started
his own factory in paterson he called
it the patent arms company his
first step was to whittle wooden
models showing his pistols mechan-
ism and on the basis of these he
received a few orders from major
sam hall of texas then still an in-
dependent republic
  in  he took some of his first
real guns to the washington arsenal
which rejected them considering
them too heavy expensive to make
too delicate for rough use in battle
and-too much of a tempation for a
soldier to fire more than once and
thus waste ammunition but the
american institute of new york
awarded a gold medal to his ten-
chamber revolving-breech rifle which
operated similarly to the pistol
  in a demonstration with it he fired
 ball bullets in less than nine min-
utes hand-loading from a powder
flask and using percussion caps for-
ty of the bullets were shot at a -
yard target  by  by  inches
twenty-three hit it and all of these
went through it but they wanted
nothing to do with his pistol saying
it was strictly a military weapon at
this time colt was only  years old
  war had broken out in florida in
 this territory not a state until
 was having trouble with the
seminole indians under the leader-
ship of chief osceola colt packed
 rifles and pistols and set out for
fort jupiter on east floridas in-
dian river he sold them quickly
since they were badly needed against
the hard-fighting redmen but he ex-
perienced infinite trouble in getting
payment
  in  colt patented a waterproof
cartridge made of tin foil with the
bullet sealed to it with wax in this
year his rifles began to become pop-
ular especially among the militia of
new jersey and michigan new jer-
sey had asked washington for per-
mission to use colts weapons as
standard equipment but it was re-
fused sam colt was discouraged but
texas came to his rescue
  texas had won her independence
from mexico in  soon after the
battle of the alamo the texas rang-
ers organized in  were using
some of colts guns but they werent
working too well especially against
the comanche indians who became
texas big problem after the mex-
icans
  these redmen were cruel and ac-
complished warriors mounted on a
fast horse each could shoot  ar-
rows so fast that one would be in the
air constantly and each could pierce
a man easily in addition to his ar-
rows each comanche carried a shield
and a -foot spear they would dash

-gun western
at the rangers fire  arrows then
retreat all in the space of a minute
 the rangers would dismount for
defense and fight back from afoot
with one or two single-shot pistols
and a single-shot rifle each of which
had to be slowly reloaded by hand
the first pistols colt provided for
them-although they contained as
many as five shots-didnt give the
rangers all the help they needed
the pistols had to be taken apart in
three pieces barrel cylinder with
five chambers and frame the right
amount of powder had to be poured
into each chamber followed by the
wad that held the powder in place
followed by the ball on top of the
wad whereupon the pistol was reas-
sembled all this took time and
certainly could not be carried out on
a prancing or galloping horse which
meant that in spite of greater fire
power the men were still at a great
disadvantage they still had to dis-
mount in order to fight
  it was colts new five-shot one-
piece pistol patented in  that
turned the tide for texas thanks to
its built-in rammer this weapon no
longer needed to be taken apart and
while the reloading operation re-
mained basically the same it could
now be carried out on horseback thus
bringing the rangers maneuverabili-
ty up to par with the indians
  a number of years later the rang-
ers were under the command of capt
john coffee hays of tennessee he
and  of his men were returning to
san antonio after a scouting trip
when they were attacked by  com-
anches who raced at them in the usual
fashion expecting the men to fire
their weapons and then before they
could reload the indians would have
 scalps on their belts but they
didnt know the rangers were armed
with the new colts
  a short while later they fled leav-
ing  redmen on the field two
white men were injured now the
comanches soon sued for peace one
chief said that it was impossible to
fight a white man who had a shot
for every finger of his hand
  that was just the beginning or-
ders came from the texian fleet not
called texan until it was annexed as
a state for  carbines at  each
and  belt pistols at  each the
texas rangers wanted  carbines
and  pistols in  florida
ordered rifles pistols and 
waterproof cartridges for use in its
swamps a resolution was introduced
in the u s senate to provide the
armed forces with colts and sam was
happy when it looked as though he
might at last be on the verge of suc-
cess-but this happiness was short-
lived
  the turbulent politics of  saw
three presidents-van buren har-
rison and tyler-and colts resolu-
tion was lost in the shuffle the
government finally bought  car-
bines in this year its harpers ferry
arsenal finally turned out a military
percussion rifle but full conversion
didnt come until seven years later
for a few years sam colt was in
real trouble his company went
bankrupt he was arrested for a 
debt his brother was convicted of
murder and killed himself in his cell
leaving his destitute family on sams
hands then in  texas saved
colt as colt had previously saved
texas in her war with the indians
  texas acquired statehood in feb-
ruary  and in april united
states soldiers fought against mex-
icans the mexican war had begun
captain sam walker came to new
york to get colt firearms-lots of
them but colt had no money not
even machinery it had all been sold
when his patent arms company went
bankrupt but sam refused to be
licked he made a contract with eli
whitney for the manufacture of 
six-shot pistols in his plant colt
didnt even have one of his own
pistols as a sample to begin produc-
tion finally he obtained one from a
friend holsters were made from a
wooden model capt walker submit-
ted to the manufacturer
  when the contract was completed
in  colt took the machinery and
tools as per his agreement with
whitney and moved to new haven
but the ordnance department hin-
dered by red tape was very slow to in-
spect and approve the first  pis-
tols in spite of pressure by walker
and colt
  finally the weapons arrived in
sam colts killer

vera cruz five days after walker
had been killed a smoking colt in
his hand at huamantla mexico
when two companies of rangers held
off  mexicans walker was the
first to refer to the pistol as the
peacemaker and wrote a glowing
testimonial for it before he died
  the colt had arrived government
orders increased and orders for sam-
ples came in from england turkey
germany france and russia all of
them curious to see the weapon made
famous by the mexican war after
the war the mexicans demanded them
in great quantities they had had a
first-hand demonstration of the ter-
rific gun and needed no selling busi-
ness increased by leaps and bounds
the pistols were improved by fluted
cylinders and pins between the per-
cussion nipples the colt factory
moved to bigger quarters
  this was a period of expansion to
the west the frontier was pushed
toward the pacific by men armed
with plows and colts axes and colts
rifles and colts and bibles and colts
such as brigham young of utah to
whom sam gave an engraved pair of
his guns the pistol embodied both
the law of the marshal and the law-
lessoess of the rustler and bandit
  in  sam went to london with
dreams of creating a great gun em-
pire there too at the great ex-
hibition in hyde park he had a dis-
play which eclipsed anything yet
seen in the trade he matched his
pistol in a contest against the british
adams revolver and won hands-
down about  were purchased by
the british colonial office for use
against the kaffir tribes in the cape
of good hope in  he opened his
huge branch factory later closed be-
cause the british would no longer
tolerate this competition at pimlico
on the thames and the english
marveled at the speed with which he
could produce production-line re-
volvers which could compete with
their custom-made models
  back in the united states the colt
works were going full blast com-
modore perry wanted  for the
navy which was the first sign of
interest from that branch of the serv-
ice but business was so good that
competitors were trying to get into
the act and soon became guilty of
direct infringement of his patents
colt sued the one who appeared to
be the most dangerous threat to his
empire the massachusetts arms co
and won then a new episode oc-
curred which bore testimony to the
colt
  in  colonel john c fremont
governor of california made an ex-
ploratory trip across the rocky
mountains together with  men to
determine railroad sites one day at
camp they were attacked by  ute
indians who told them they wanted
supplies and gunpowder if they
couldnt have these they would kill
the white men fremont gave in-
structions to one of his men who
went outside put a piece of paper
against a tree and shot it with his
navy colt the indians laughed
they could do the same with their
own rifles
  but the gunman fired a second and
third time then the chief shot the
colt as did two of his braves they
were amazed and decided they would
gladly pay for their supplies with
horses they couldnt fight men who
had guns which never needed re-
loading
  in  colt completed a vast new
armory on the banks of the con-
necticut river in hartford its per-
sian dome can still be seen from afar
by tourists traveling the main route
through hartford between new york
and boston in that year he incorpor-
ated his business into the colts pat-
ent fire-arms manufacturing com-
pany now there was no more to be
done and although only  colt was
old before his time
  he had succeeded in making his
dream come true but he was a sick
man he had contracted inflammatory
rheumatism was getting worse the
civil war was imminent the state
of virginia asked colt to investigate
the possibility of building an armory
at richmond and he sent one of hfs
men to investigate but his heart wasnt
in it georgia alabama carolina-all
pleaded with him for arms in 
the confederate states of america
were formed and colt offered his serv-
ices to lincoln advising him to arm
 men immediately

mojave jack was a paid killer a
man whose gun was for hire
didnt prod a trailtown marshal
into a fight   
  noon
tomorrow
by
phillip
morgan
     gun was cut end
firing not aiming
he gunman known
throughout the territory as
mojave jack rode into bent
fork just before noon on a hot sum-
mer day he stabled his horse at the
dutchmans and went down the street
to the palace saloon people were
alerted wlen he rode in and by the
time he took the stroll from the livery
barn to the saloon there were two
hundred paifs of eyes on him
  he wasnt anything special to look
at being about average height and
build but he moved with a feline
softness and quickness his face was
all hard angles and planes giving an
overall impression of flatness and his
eyes were blue he squinted so that
it was hard to see his eyes and his
head kept up a ceaseless turning as
he looked this way and that
  there was a downward cast to his
thin mouth and monty ferris re-
marked later that he looked like a
man who hadnt smiled in twenty
years the marks of his trade were
in the single gun he wore low tied
down its black butt shiny with wear
and in the thin leather gloves that
covered his hands even on this hot
day that and the way he acted so
scornful and cold and aloof
 mojave jack was no more than
through the doors of the palace when
they started coming marshal jim
forbes had known they would come
and he was patiently waiting sitting
solidly there in his big chair behind
the desk in his office he was a
young square-built man with a face
burned brown by years of riding in
sun and wind a man who had come
up the trail from texas four times
and who knew the smell of trouble
well he waited while the influential
nervous citizens of bent fork
s
noon tomorrow

crowded into his small office he
nodded at each man as he came in
they didnt waste time once they
were inside there were twelve of
them there
  jim mojave jack just rode into
town mayor fred keaton announced
pompously as if the whole didnt
know already
  i saw him jim answered
  well what are you going to do
about it bill osborn asked hotly
nothing jim said
  what do you mean nothing ed
holmes asked in a voice that was al-
most a shout you cant let him stay
think of the women and kids if he
itays someonell get hurt youre
paid to keep this town clean and we
want you to do your job
  i told you when i took the job
that id do it my way jim said he
wait smiling at them and there was a
cool contempt in that smile mojave
jack isnt wanted anywhere in this
territory i have no reason to run
him out
  hes killed ten men fred keaton
said you know hes been hired to do
those killins its common knowledge
just because hes forced his victims
to draw first hes gotten away with
it but hes here to kill someone and
you have to stop him
  ill talk to him jim said and
got to his feet he stood for a mo-
ment silently regarding the anxious
faces of the men i cant run him out
unless he does something wrong i
can warn him against breaking the
law and i can maybe tell him to be
gone before tomoroow noon but thats
all if any of you have any reason
to think hes after you i suggest you
get out of town fast ill try to
protect you bist i cant guarantee it
jim strode through them and out of
the office leaving an uneasy silence
behind him
a s he walked slowly down to
the palace jim was thinking
they were right of course mojave
jack was a killer and he was here on
a mission but he was within his rights
to be here jim had seen the gunman
kill a man two years before in
cheyenne and he didnt like the idea
of going against him
  still this was his town and he had
to enforce the law and protect the
people if that meant going against
mojave jack he would have to do it
  then he was busy trying to think
who it could be that the killer was
after it was impossible to tell since
anyone could have hired him to shoot
any man in town jim shook his head
and entered the saloon
  monty ferris the owner was be-
hind the bar and he raised his eye-
brows in mute warning when jim
walked in jim merely nodded to him
and swept his eyes around the room
until he found the still figure of
mojave jack sitting at one of the side
tables his chair backed against the
wall the gunman was watching jim
with a strict attention his hands
motionless on the table jim crossed
the room and stood beside the table
  welcome to bent fork jack he
said im jim forbes marshal here
glad to meet you marshal mo-
jave jack said
  youve got people here all in a
sweat jim said theyre takin it
out on me how long were you plan-
nin to stay jim pushed his words
at the gunman slow and easy not
wanting to anger him jim knew that
mojave jack could probably beat him
in a fight and therefore he wanted
no fight
  i cant see that its any of your
business the gunman replied coolly
there was insolence in his tone and
that puzzled jim the gunman acted
like a man looking for trouble but
from what jim knew of jacks type
they only fought when they were
paid to kill
  just the same i think youd bet-
ter tell me youre welcome here
overnight after that youre not wel-
come i thought wed better have an
understanding about that
 mojave jack smiled tightly
youre a brave man marshal i ad-
mire a brave man as long as he isnt
a fool it would be foolish to try to
send me out of town before im ready
to go the gunmans eyes were wide-
sprung and jim smelled trouble on
him the man was cocked ready to
fight and jim didnt understand it
  im just hopin youll go without
that noon tomorrow should be time
enough dont stay beyond that
  he turned on his heel and walked
from the saloon catching the fright-
ened look on monty ferris face

-gun western
  going back to the office jim
pondered his conversation with the
gunman he was puzzled by mojave
jacks edginess it was almost as
though the man had wanted a fight
but that couldnt be if he was here
to kill a man he would want to keep
out of trouble until the job was done
  perhaps he thought that everyone
was afraid of him and consequently
was insolent with everyone but if
that were true he was doing some
wrong thinking jim wasnt afraid of
mojave jack he had a respect for
jacks ability with a gun but better
gunmen had gone down if it came
to a fight it wouldnt be the first
time jim had looked through gun-
smoke
  he intended to keep a sharp watch
on jack while he was in town and he
intended to enforce his order to
leave he had governed bent fork
for better than a year and no man was
going to change that just by riding in
with a big reputation and scaring the
people
jim kept a sharp watch on the
street all afternoon and it amused
him to see fred keaton slip out the
back door of the bank saddle a horse
and line out of town something was
on keatons conscience and he was
taking no chances at three ed
holmes also rode out by five oclock
six respected businessmen had de-
parted hurriedly the town was quiet
as though peopled by dead men no-
one moved abroad and tension hung
over the street like summer heat
close and binding at six oclock mo-
jave jack came from the palace and
strode unhurriedly to nell petersons
cafe jeff left the office and went
down there at once
  jim sat four stools down from mo-
jave jack and ordered his supper the
gunman had given him one cool ap-
praising glance when he came in and
that was all after that the two men
ignored each other and ate in a strict
silence nell peterson was nervous
and made an unaccustomed racket as
she served the three other customers
she dropped a cup and the sound was
like a shot men along the counter
jumped at the noise and then grinned
foolishly everyone ate in frantic
haste and departed mojave jack took
his time drinking a second cup of
coffee when he had finished his meal
he and jim were the only two diners
left in the cafe nell peterson came
to take jacks dollar and the gunman
smiled at her
  you aint too particular who you
serve are you maam he asked and
turned to look full on at jim nells
blue eyes darkened with fear and her
hand shook as she picked up the dol-
lar she couldnt answer
  are you on the prod jack jim
asked softly if you are just make
it plain
  why no marshal not at all
what ever gave you that idea jack
got up in one quick movement and
went to the door he stopped there
and turned about and asked that
was noon tomorrow wasnt it
thats right
  so-long marshal jack said and
left the cafe jim sat still more puz-
zled than before trying to make sense
out of the gunmans words nell came
down the counter and put her hand
on his
  oh jim dont cross him hed
kill a man just for the funof it you
can see it in his eyes
  she was a tall girl strong and well-
built a girl who had always had to
work hard for what she got she and
jim had gone together off and on for
all the time he had been here he
could never quite face the thought
of settling down and being married
so he had never asked her her pride
was too strong to let her push him
but she loved him and she couldnt
conceal it at this moment looking
at her jim thought she was lovely
he squeezed her hand and smiled
  dont worry honey hes just edgy
his kind dont shoot men for fun
hes been hired to kill someone here
and as soon as hes done his job hell
ride out i stepped on his toes when
i told him to be out of town by
tomorrow noon and he wants to show
me he isnt scared any but hell get
his job done before noon and be out
of here
  but wont you have to arrest him
for murder
  hes too smart for that hell make
the other man draw first and claim
self-defense i wont have anything
to hold him for
  but he was mad at you jim the
noon tomorrow

way he looked at you i thought he
was going to draw on you right in
here
  it almost seemed that way jim
agreed but it couldnt be hed have
no reason for hunting me no-one
would pay good money to have me
killed no hes just a killer and they
all go off the deep end in time his
nerves are probably about shot jim
stood up and smiled again dont
worry about him
  i hope youre right she said
doubtfully he started for the door
and she said jim and came
around the counter
he stopped and she walked up
to him and kissed him on the lips
and stepped back her face very grave
it surprised him so that he stood
motionless for a moment and then he
stepped forward took her in his arms
and kissed her fully when he re-
leased her and stepped back he was
shaken by the intensity of the kiss
and by the warm crush of her soft
body against him
  i guess he said it is time to
either fish or cut bait is that it
nell
  thats for you to know jim
  why i suppose thats right ill be
around to see you sometime after
noon tomorrow he stepped forward
and kissed her quickly and wheeled
to walk from the cafe the blonde
girl stood with her hands pressed
over her heart and her face heavy
with worry for him
  a boy on the street told jim that
mojave jack was again in the palace
and he wondered about that the gun-
man was apparently in no hurry to
seek out his victim with only a few
hours remaining to him it seemed
strange that jack would not get to
work jim couldnt believe that the
gunman would wait past noon that
would mean another fight and with
a man who knew how to use a gun
jacks kind didnt take unnecessary
chances
  maybe jack thought his victim
would come to the saloon tonight a
thought that ordinarily wouldnt be
too far off since the palace was the
towns best saloon but everyone knew
the gunman was in town and if a man
had any reason to think that he was
marked for death he would not go
near the place several menhad rid-
den out already it had jim baffled
  he made his usual night rounds
hitting all the saloons including the
palace and everything was running
smoothly in most of the places a
sizeable crowd was on hand and they
were all eager to talk to jim about
mojave jack jim didnt stop to talk
he knew no more about it than they
did the word was out that he had
given the killer until tomorrow noon
to leave and they were speculating
about that but he let them speculate
  when he came to the palace he
found it deserted except for mojave
jack old doc barnes and monty
ferris the gunman only glanced at
jim incuriously and went back to his
game of cards ferris shrugged ex-
pressively and jim shook his head
  he went out and down the street
and met nell as she closed the cafe
at ten he walked her home and nei-
ther of them mentioned mojave jack
he knew she was worried but she
knew men and she sensed that he
didnt want to talk about it she
would do her worrying in private
his respect for her increased with
the knowledge that she refused to
make his job tougher by saddling him
with her worries
  after he left nell jim continued
his patrol of the streets until mid-
nite but the town was quiet it was
the time of year when there was
plenty of work on the ranches and
the only big night was saturday mo-
jave jack sat quietly in the palace
showing no interest in the town or
its people a deadly enigma shaking
his head in wonder jim went to his
room at the hotel undressed and
turned in he laid awake a long time
thinking but got nowhere and final-
ly dropped into an uneasy sleep
in the morning jim was down
early and had breakfast at nells
there were dark circles under her
eyes telling of a sleepless night but
she had a smile for him and she didnt
mention mojave jack after break-
fast he went to the palace and found
monty ferris in his office in the back
of the saloon there was no-one else
in the place except ernie shields
the swamper who was lazily sweep-
ing up jim sat down and pushed
his hat back and smiled at monty

-gun western
  well what happened
  nothing happened the saloon-
keeper said tersely except he
ruined my business he just sat there
dealin cards and watchin the door
he drank one beer between eight and
one and got up and left i cant fig-
ure it out somethins up but i cant
get the drift of it
  i cant either i was certain he
came here to kill someone and he
acts like he did but nothins hap-
pened and he doesnt go lookin for
anyone jim got up and settled his
hat on his head if he starts any-
thing in here this morning let me
know and ill come runnin he didnt
ride clear up here from cheyenne for
the exercise
  if hes still here at noon whatre
you going to do monty asked flat-
ty-
  tell him to leave town
  and if he dont go
  ill have to put him out hes done
nothing i can arrest him for but hes
disturbin the peace just the same i
gave him time enough at noon he
goes
  i dont envy you the job hes a
mean one you look into his eyes and
theres nothing there theyre as cold
as a dead mackerel
  so-long monty jim said and
walked through the saloon and out
onto the board walk
  he was just up the street from the
hotel now and mojave jack came out
onto the porch he looked up and
saw jim and a cold smile touched the
corners of his mouth it was less a
smile than a smirk and jim felt a
cold tingle along his spine almost
like a warning there was something
evil about mojave jack something
missing that was found in decent men
and it shook everyone when they saw
it
  jim returned the stare and mojave
jack nodded and turned off the porch
he went up the street and turned
in at the cafe jim angled across the
street to his office he dropped into
a chair and prepared to wait until
mojave jack showed his hand there
was little he could do he took out
his  checked the brass butts of
the loads slid the gun back into
holster
  then he was pushed by a sudden
burst of energy and got to his feet
and punched the shells out of his
gun for the next fifteen minutes
he practiced drawing and firing he
drew and snapped the hammer at
pictures and reward dodgers on the
wall satisfied at last he replaced the
shells in the gun and settled again in
the chair
  the morning dragged slowly by
by ten oclock jim felt as if he were
sitting on a keg of dynamite the
whole town was waiting with a dread
that was faintly mixed with anticipa-
tion life in bent fork was usually
pretty dull and mojave jack had
wiped out that dullness the people
feared him yet his presence fascin-
ated them and they had passed the
stories about him from mouth to
mouth until now he was reputed to
have killed a hundred men and was
supposed to be faster than wild
bill in his office jim watched the
hands of the clock crawl towards
noon and began to think for the first
time that mojave jack was not going
to leave it didnt make sense but
thats how it looked
at ten-thirty jim heard a
horse come down main at the
gallop and went to the window to
see who it was johnny benton who
rode for pete hansons lazy  rode
down the street and pulled into the
hitchrack at the palace johnny was
twenty slim and reckless and a little
wild but a good kid he was wearing
a gun but mojave jack wouldnt be
after him jim returned to his chair
and settled down he had barely got-
ten settled when boots thudded along
the walk and ernie shields burst
into the office the old swamper was
white and shaking with excitement
  monty says to come quick jim
that killers got johnny benton
cornered ands givin him a rough
time of it it looks like johnny was
the one he was after
  jim was out of his chair and run-
ning before the words were out of
ernies mouth he aimed for the
door of the palace and ran hard not
stopping to think about this in the
back of his mind it seemed strange
that a high-priced killer like mojave
jack should ride five hundred miles
to take on johnny benton johnny
was no gunman anyone who half-
way knew how to use a gun could
noon tomorrow

have done a job on johnny but in his
haste jim didnt take time to think
it out
  jim piled through the door of the
palace and found johnny benton
still-posted in the center of the floor
mojave jack leaned back negligently
his elbows resting on the bar his
right hand was dropped down near
the butt of his gun and that wicked
smile curled the corners of his lips
johnny was white-faced with shock
and fear but he held his ground
  what you pickin on me for
johnny asked as jim came in
  i aint pickin on you boy i just
said you looked like a yellow sheep-
herder it aint my fault the way
you look
  jim moved up on johnnys right
side and mojave jack straightened
a queer light came into his eyes a
glitter and suddenly it hit jim with
all the force of a sledge-hammer blow
to the belly it wasnt johnny benton
that the killer wanted that was a
ruse his real victim was jim forbes
for a moment the knowledge para-
lyzed jim and then his mind began
to function coldly and surely if he
was to survive he had to think clear-
ly surely
  get out of here johnny jim
said therell be no fightin in my
town johnny wanted to go but he
didnt want to appear a coward so
he hung back for a moment get
movin johnny jim said again
  this time the young puncher left
monty ferris stirred behind the bar
as though released from the weight of
some mighty load he sighed
 jim laughed then and he saw
surprise momentarily break the sur-
face of mojave jacks eyes you can
quit actin jack it took me long
enough but i finally know who you
came to kill why didnt you just
say so yesterday afternoon instead of
sparrin around all this time you
came to kill me
  jim heard monty ferris gasp and
then mojave jacks harsh voice
rasped through the stillness thats
right marshal i came to get you and
no-one hired me to do it i wanted
an excuse to get you to draw on me
and that young puncher was it but
he wouldnt quite take the bait you
got here too fast
  jim was placed twenty paces from
mojave jack and he wasnt going to
let the man get any closer at
twenty paces a man could easily
miss especially if he hurried the
shot jim didnt fool himself that he
could outdraw the killer so he had
to make the man miss that first shot
  what did i ever do to you jim
asked
  you killed my brother in the
street here last fall he didnt have
a chance
 jim remembered the man and
thinking back he could see now that
there was a strong family resemblance
between the two
  i remember he said he was in
here drinking and causing trouble i
warned him to cut it out and left he
followed me out and called to me as
i walked across the street he drew
and fired when i turned on him his
first shot missed and mine didnt
you killed him and im here to
square accounts thats all that mat-
ters
  that would be all that mattered
with you jim said a sneer in his
voice sure i shot him down and
id do it again he was a worthless
gutless punk jack just like you
he saw the words hit the gunman
like physical blows saw the hate that
flared in his eyes mojave jacks
mouth twitched spasmodically and he
looked like a crazy man jim felt cold
and alone his senses acutely tuned
to every move the deadly one in front
of him made
  mojave jack said im going to
shoot you in the belly and watch
you claw the floor while you die
he stopped talking and jim
laughed at him jim saw the gunmans
eyes flicker wildly once then nar-
row saw his shoulder dip and jim
drew mojave jacks draw was a
flash that beat jim a full tenth of a
second the killers gun roared and
bucked back in his hand but the
slug missed jims hip a split hair
jims gun was out and he fired not
aiming he lowered the gun to his
side knowing he would have no time
for a second shot
 mojave jack was jerked back
against the bar as though some
mighty fist had smashed him in the
chest his gun fell from his hand
and bounced once on the floor he

remarkable auburn-haired beauty who
in the past few months had enlivened
both calebs life and the season of
serious drama at san franciscos

final curtain
by l v
pidgeon
shovel and pan stopped a moment to
consider the news and drifted toward
the main camp
  caleb halloway stirred his six-
foot frame was stretched comfortably
in the shade of his tent a favorite
position in the late afternoons while
other men labored
  john duncans a fool and his horse
is an ass caleb said indignantly and
the saying of it made him feel better
helped greatly to break the spell cast
over him by the contents of a letter
received that morning from one ellen
ofaye ellen was a young lady of
remote camp called dogleg in answer
to a brief note of his was in the na-
ture of a surprise and the veiled sum-
 hed put endless dusty
 miles and numberless
 brawling gold camps be-
 tween them but it was a
 question whether caleb
 halloway could ever for-
 get miss ellen ofaye

final curtain

mons it contained was pure mystery
    and dear caleb she wrote if
they do uncle windmill out of his
little gold strike you must come to
my hanging for ill happily murder a
vile person named reno cucci 
  caleb sighed he got to his feet
stretched and brushed aimlessly at his
clothing he placed the letter of ellen
ofaye carefully in his pocket and
with an ample kerchief bent to flick
at the dust layering his tightly-
tailored boot
  lean and sun-whipped from his re-
cent journey south caleb still held
the touch of pallor across his features
which hinted at time spent on the
stage or in the pulpit he had in fact
graced the boards of washington
hall and sacramentos eagle theater
in drama both legitimate and lusty
his present exile was purely the re-
sult of an unprecedented emotional
collision with miss ellen ofaye
  he had fallen in love which was a
matter of outrageous interest super-
imposed upon no principal if he was
in love he also was chronically penni-
less and with scant prospects for the
future hed fled like a coward from
miss ofaye placed many miles and
brawling gold camps between them
maybe she would go away back east
and become famous and leave the
west and caleb halloway alone
  inside his patchwork shanty of can-
vas and board caleb donned a ruffled
shirt and a cravat a waistcoat of calf-
skin and a frock coat cut high in the
back and with fine buttons and wide
silk lapels the coat alone had cost
him  during a brief golden period
along san franciscos ambrosial path
on his head he cocked a silk hat with
a broad graceful roll which added a
fine dignity to his appearance caleb
was a man of no colossal humility
  and one man in his time he said
wryly plays many roles then he
stepped out into the hullabaloo of the
mariposa diggings
lnorty men milled like nervous
  cattle in the opening before the cir-
cular tent saloon tied soundly to the
trunk of a tree was a young miner
known to caleb as joe salem
upon calebs approach the talk and
milling came to a stop had judge
addison halloway on his bench back
in new york viewed the scene he
might well have experienced a mo-
mentary lessening of hostility toward
this youngest son the one who had
seen fit to cast away a respectable
career in the law for the sins and
specious glories of the dramatic hall
  on three previous occasions in as
many weeks caleb halloway had held
court in mariposa tense and bellig-
erent crowds had sensed the edge of
calm reason in his rulings and noted
favorably his judicial bearing he
nodded to many around and stood
waiting silent the assemblage must
act of its own accord in the terms
and traditions of the ancient folk-
moot which ruled in the gold camp
  john duncan finally spoke up in
the shrill voice which betrayed his
emotion i nominate caleb he said
to be judge of the horse thief we
got tied to the tree there his an-
nouncement was promptly followed
by sufficient eyes to make the elec-
tion legal
  caleb cleared his throat portentous-
ly the court he said is in order
  he walked to the tree and gazed
solemnly at joe salem joe was a
young fiery-eyed man of bullish
strength and a reputation for sudden
violence he spat contemptuously at
the ruffled shirt front but caleb
craftily side-stepped without losing
his composure turning away he said
all right john duncan whats the
story
  i caught him in the very act
caleb john duncan said heatedly
got a touch of the sun so i rode in
early from the claim left the horse
saddled and tied while i went into th-
tent to rest came out later to find
joe riding off on him
  there was an angry murmur from
the others go on john caleb said
when it gets quiet
  i hollered and joe started kicking
the horse to get him going said
john then the wherry brothers ran
up and caught him and brought him
back and we tied him up after some
fancy scufflin
  calebs gaze found the wherry
brothers in the crowd they both nod-
ded vigorously in agreement and the
older of them said its what hap-
pened caleb

-gun western
 i wouldnt take  for that
horse john duncan declared a
good mounts scarce in these parts
and theres none ive seen as good as
this one
 caleb looked at joe salem if
youve got any defense joe we bet-
ter hear it
  ive been associating with polecats
so long i got lonesome for a horse
joe fired back
 maybe you were drunk said
caleb
  i was sober joe said
  maybe you got claim-happy joe
caleb persisted sort of lost your
head for a minute
  most sensible thing ive done since
i got to this hell-hole gold country
joe salem retorted id have rid that
horse straight to santa fe and points
east
  hes a confessed horse thief john
duncan said high and angry
  seems like time for a hangin the
elder wherry brother said
  caleb said there being no defense
joe salem is found guilty of attempt-
ing to steal the horse of john duncan
now theres the question of the
penalty
  hes guilty he hangs said john
caleb turned on him and stared
coldly as elected presiding officer
of this meeting i intend to do the fair
thing kccording to common sense he
said
  you afraid to hang a horse thief
john duncan said
  joe did a fool thing caleb said
which i dont think hell repeat and
youve still got your horse john
aint you going to hang him
caleb felt a wave of distaste rise in
him for john duncan a man wronged
but claiming compensation to the hilt
-compensation of another mans life
he pronounced judgment joe salem
gets  lashes on his back for tem-
porarily losing his head and trying to
ride off on another mans horse
ill be shot john duncan yelled
of all the cowardly
  while the wherry brothers turn
joe around at his tree there and de-
liver the sentence caleb cut in im
straight-away going to lick john dun-
can for calling me a coward the
courts adjourned
  he morning was grey and cold
as caleb walked north if there
was a stiffer man in the mother lode
he was not sober to suffer as caleb
did his legs and arms ached sorely
and his head seemed split and held
together only by the bandage bound
tightly over his brow one eye was
purple puffed and closed and his
lower lip felt like some frog sat there
his nose was broken fearsomely and
he groaned as the chill air buffed it
  when the first ray of sun topped a
craggy peak caleb stopped beside a
stream to bathe his face he sat awhile
to rest and cast a suspicious eye on
his companion
  joe salem knelt down like a very
old man to cup his hands and drink at
the stream when he stood up caleb
could see the pain in the deeply drawn
lines around his mouth caleb could
imagine the striated back shorn of
flesh and stiffening in the cold joe
was like some thick trunk of tree bit-
ten cruelly by the axe
 you should have stole a horse
stead of tanglin with john duncan
joe said to caleb they beat my
hide off but i still got my beautiful
face
 caleb grunted johns in poor
shape this morning too he said
  joe salem nodded you was doing
fine till the two of you went  feet
down that coyote shaft
  caleb winced at the recollection of
that plunge the rock sides of the
shaft burning his hide raw and the
slag-heap landing that came near to
unhinge-ing him
 youve busted me up for fair
joe caleb said accusingly i was
a respected man in the community
till you stole a horse and i got mad
at john duncan and refused to hang
you
  youd have been elected alcalde in
time joe acknowledged got a fair
sensible streak in you or id be dan-
glin from a tree this minute
  caleb shook his head and then hung
onto it a moment with both hands to
stop the throbbing they dont want
an alcalde that wont hang a horse
thief thats why i was told to git
when they dragged me from that
hole
  thing is i aint a real horse thief
pinal curtain

said joe you got a mind and could
see it youre a man of justice  
  you would have done until a real
horse thief came along said caleb
he got to his feet rolled a little with
his dizziness and then started north
  from mt bullion to bear valley
to bagby to coulterville and on north
he marched in the coming days and
it was a painful journey to a man of
pride caleb felt the deep pity for
himself-an actor with both his face
and spirit mauled an odd figure in
rough pants and jacket cast off by
some camp along the way a filthy
flop-brimmed hat partially obscuring
a battered face thick-matted with a
tawny beard
  there was the night the hewgag
brayed in a lonely sierra camn where
caleb and joe found refuge the an-
cient and honorable order of e
clampus vitus assaulted the black si-
lences with hilarious revelry and a
salubrious parade beneath a mammoth
hoopskirt emblazoned this is the
banner we fight under
  argonauts fought the ravages of
toil and boredom heroically that night
and even joe salem marched and was
duly initiated into bacchic and bliss-
ful unconsciousness but caleb had
one single drink and brooded in the
shadows
  next morning he pushed on again
and behind him labored joe salem
joe had been beaten too and driven
out but not broken youre a man of
justice caleb hed said but caleb
knew that this was not so he knew
that he was an acting man-an actor
who had filled a disastrous role one
late afternoon and fooled an oaf
named joe salem
he dramatic hall at the
camp of dogleg was low-ceilinged
with a slab-timbered roof which tilted
south to shed the rains and a rough
board floor which tilted north to shed
tobacco juice and tears which flowed
copiously on nights of rich drama
the slightly elevated stage rested
precariously on wooden horses and a
painted female figure of some bosomy
munificence graced the calico curtains
which drew the thin line between
audience and player
 dogleg was a larger camp than
mariposa and to joe salems prac-
ticed eye even less well organized
it had the feel of an ornery brawling
camp and joe was surprised that
caleb would linger there he was
purely astonished when on the third
day caleb filed a small pan-and-shov-
el claim on a stream a mile out of
camp and on that saturday night fol-
lowed other citizens of dogleg to the
dramatic hall
  booming laughter oaths and gun-
fire collided mightily with wind bolts
from tall mountain peaks as miners
crowded toward the hall a large
soiled banner pummeled by the gusts
proclaimed
the ofayes-
lovely ellen and grand
william with company
in
lady of lyons and
othello
  caleb sat well back in the hall a
curious sickness in him the like of
which always assailed him at curtain
time ellen had drawn him here even
in his present sorry condition-and
grand william that was ellens un-
cle windmill ofaye who got his
nickname from the flailing violence
with which he threw himself into his
stage portrayals caleb well remem-
bered the night in sacramento when
uncle windmill destroyed his voice
during the mad scene in lear uncle
windmill spoke ever after in a pecu-
liarly resonant whisper
  ellens round full voice jerked
caleb back into the present he was
on his feet and roaring with the rest
when she took the stage her little
speech was mainly cut off and she
just stood there smiling and inclining
her head and sweet-looking enough to
squeeze a mans heart
  she raised her hands finally the
shows on she called out and well
do our best for you handsome gentle-
men weve only one request-no
sooting till the final curtain
  the clamor rose again and caleb
blessed the anonymity of his hat and
beard and battered face-for ellen
was close in that little hall too close
and he felt like a sad dog of a man

-gun western
the evening sped by while
caleb dreamed and ellen and un-
cle windmill spun their magic for
lonely gold seekers it was near the
end of the program when caleb made
his grevious error uncle windmill
fortifying himself between scenes
with hot water and whiskey had over-
done and become befuddled when he
labored to a tortuous halt in mid-
speech caleb from far back in the
hall intoned then must you
speak of one that loved not wisely
but too well 
  uncle windmill snorted dead cen-
ter swung around and stared caleb
struggled to his feet in confusion and
scuffled out into the windy night
  caleb squatted three hours next
morning over the streambed and
panned a lucky ounce of gold and was
ignorant of just when joe salem ar-
rived to sit in the tree shade and
smoke and contemplate him
  you know them ofayes dont
you caleb joe said finally caleb
nodded sifting rhythmically at his
pan
  i figured so said joe else why
do we stop here and file a claim and
go down to a showing at the dramatic
hall
i stop here said caleb shortly
you can go where you please joe
why do you keep hid under your
hat and bush whiskers caleb you
afraid of her
  caleb stopped his sifting he set
the pan down on a rock and looked
over at his companion joe in some
special way had become a part of
caleb during their long trek north on
the mother lode hed become an
honest dogged goading thing which
at first followed and later drove caleb
-like a conscience he was prodding
now too hard
  you think too much joe salem
either pan gold or get out
  the girls in trouble caleb her
and her uncle are in a claim fight
with a dude named reno cucci hes
about to beat them out
  caleb picked up his pan again and
resumed sifting
  its a queer point joe went on
reno was working quartz ledges on
both sides of a little gulch ofaye
tracked a rich placer run in the
stream between the ledges and
claimed it cucci raised ned of
course and some of the boys think
hes mean btot in his rights most
dont give a hoot
  i dont give a hoot said caleb
they say ellen ofaye brought
her uncle into the gold camps because
the stage was killin him off they
say if reno takes this strike away
from him itll kill him sure dont
seem just somehow
  hold court and settle it caleb
snapped
  joe got up and knocked the ashes
from his pipe theyre holding
court tomorrow night and renos al-
ready spending the gold hes gonna be
awarded
  caleb sifted on head bowed still
searching his pan for the tell-tale glit-
ter he was mightily relieved when
joe salem walked away
iitts not in my heart to dispos-
--sess a lady of such charm as miss
ofaye of any rightful claim she may
have on a fortune to match her fame
reno cucci was saying smoothly the
late afternoon sun struck a lively
gleam in renos over-large black eyes
and broad toothy smile he was a
big man sure in the knowledge of his
shrewdness and arresting good looks
  this matter of a placer strike her
uncle has made directly in the midst
of my quartz ledges can be easily
resolved he said
  the men of dogleg stirred and nod-
ded to one another and temescal mur-
phy the presiding officer looked
hugely comforted to be caught in the
middle of a dispute between the adriot
and sinister reno and a purposeful
woman like ellen ofaye was neither
pleasant nor healthful temescal was
a simple and honest man who was
well aware that a wrong move could
ruin him
  uncle windmill from across the
circle of men cleared his throat
what is your purpose sir-your of-
fer he said in his half-whisper
  reno shrugged gesturing in comic
exaggeration with his large flat
hands ellen must marry me
  the miners howled with laughter
they pounded knees slapped hats to
the earth and jig-stepped and reno
grinned immensely
final curtain

  its the only answer one man
roared marry em up temescal
  uncle windmill crossed the space
in three short jumps his nose col-
lided agonizingly with renos sud-
denly doubled fist he shuddered
groaned aloud and fell face-forward
ellen was down beside him swiftly
while temescal took out his gun and
fired twice in the air to restore order
  the sight of the girl there minister-
ing to the fallen ofaye sobered the
men of dogleg more effectively than
temescals gunfire fun and hell are
fine but no lady is treated like that
  from the very midst of the crowd
suddenly stepped a newcomer to
camp holding up his hands demand-
ing attention joe salem a flushed
and angry man addressed temescal
  theres a gent here who can talk
on this case he said loudly hes a
man born with a nugget of sense-
which is worth more than all the gold
well dig out of this hell-hole i de-
mand he be heard i refer to my pard-
ner standing over there
  faces turned toward caleb hallo-
way and a path opened to where he
stood nervously caleb pulled his
hat brim low and straightened his
shoulders he was painfully conscious
of ellen still kneeling beside uncle
windmill but looking intently at
him this was a shameful entrance
that was being forced upon him by
the treacherous joe salem
  judge halloway joe salem an-
nounced burning all bridges behind
him
  temescal murphy sought to assess
caleb you know about this dispute
-judge he said cautiously
  caleb nodded there was the light
now of recognition in ellens eyes
there was the mouth opening slowly
in disbelief and there was finally
an urgent and troubling cue for ac-
tion ellens cue pierced a wave of
such fright and dread as caleb had
never experienced before he knew
the sorry spectacle he made but there
was no place to run or hide
  doglegs a fair and just camp he
managed to say pulling his eyes from
ellens his mind reached back fever-
ishly into his considerations of the
sleepless night before he had gone
over joe salems account of this dis-
pute minutely and somewhere hed
caught a spark of light
  its been held in other camps-
according to common sense-that gold
digging is a franchise from the gov-
ernment free to all he said
  he paused to look around let his
words sink in to build some impact
on the crowd if reno cucci staked
a claim on quartz ledges let him work
the quartz ledges
 he waited another moment and
looked down at uncle windmill if
william ofaye staked a placer-
even in the very midst of the quartz
ledges-let him use that placer claim
there was a murmur and shuffling
of feet among the miners they were
ripe now for any fair way out the
girl kneeling down by her uncle there
was a plumb embarrassing sight to
men instinctively chivalrous and
then too this new fellow was talk-
ing sense
  i say this said caleb warming to
his subject if in that same gulch of
reno cucci and william ofaye i
find a breeze that carries gold dust i
should be allowed to stake a claim on
that breeze and strain gold from it
against all comers
  the final point immensely amused
and appealed to the men of dogleg
they forthwith and loudly voted
sanction of uncle windmills placer-
claim and hauled him victoriously to
the tent saloon for purposes of vigor-
ous revival temescal murphy shout-
ed the disputes settled and led
the way
  but reno cucci stayed behind he
intercepted caleb on the way out of
camp he drew the long knife fast
with deadly purpose but he never go
to use it joe salems fist from out of
nowhere nearly pulverized an ear and
drove him senseless to the ground
  the law is good but you got to
back it up caleb said joe salem
grinning and rubbing at his big
knuckles then he noticed the girl
and promptly hustled toward the
gathering where uncle windmills
wits were being joyously resurrected
  ellen ofaye said judge hallo-
way as i live and breathe and there
was a tender mockery in her eyes as
she hurried toward him that purely
captured caleb	end
dick baird
the victim wai directly in his sights
mans
hand
 shattuck was dead even be-
 fore he pitched from saddle he
 lay sprawled on his back staring
 up banjo-eyed at the starry sky that
 looked like silver studs holding in
 place a vast blue-black lid
 whoever had picked off
 shattuck was a dead shot
 with a - and sheriff
 jep parnell knew that the
 seven gunnies siding the
 killer would be equally
 handy with sixshooters
  the big claybank nuzzled shattuck
gently and tossed his head when the
man failed to move whinnying soft-
ly the horse then turned and gal-
loped back the way hed come-along
the winding bed of the rake the riv-
er was low-there had been little rain
in sassafee valley-and the clay-
banks hoofs shot occasional sparks
as he pounded back toward tonka
city
  the mineral saloon was quiet al-
most empty sheriff jep parnell
straightened in his chair and glanced
at the clock behind the bar the
hands lacked five minutes till mid-
night he threw down his cards and
stood up
  i dont like this business parnell
  was tall almost gaunt and his gray
  eyes narrowed in their wide-set sock-
  ets his blond hair was in sharp con-
  trast to the brown planes of his face
  shattuck shouldnt have gone by
  himself
he stepped through the swinging
doors and the three cattlemen still
seated at the table could hear the
clump of his heels on the planking
of the porch

dead mans hand

  keen ralston sluiced a stream of
tobacco juice into the spittoon
jeps worry in about nothin been
itchy as a sand hen ever since poler
dropped johnny thomas last week
hells fire ben poler aint gonna
start another ruckus now jep bein
elected sheriff kind of set ben back
on his heels he knows jep hasnt
forgot about that fifty head hes
missin
  a startled look came into ralstons
eyes he ran his thumb along the
gray stubble of his beard and fanned
his hand aces-and-eights he looked
first at cliff bristow and then at
cliffs brother jim neither spoke
but cliff quietly picked up the dead
mans hand and shuffled it into the
deck
  the sound of running feet thudded
on the porch a fair-cheeked youth
of seventeen or eighteen burst into
the room and fell against the table
shattucks horse just came in by it-
self he almost babbled and sheriff
parnell is goin out to look for him
he says you all should go along
  jep was already in the saddle when
ralston and the bristow brothers
hurried from the saloon he was
checking his rifle but no sign of
excitement or nervousness showed on
his angular face he pulled the flat-
crowned stetson low over his eyes
  lets get going parnell said to
the three shattuck probably fol-
lowed the river and unless i miss my
guess thats where well find him
he reined the black away from the
rail and flung over his shoulder
then were going out to find ben
poler
  the three bar k boys were right
behind him they hit the end of the
street at a full gallop and didnt slow
until they reached the banks of rake
river jep held up his hand
  ralston you and i will follow the
bed cliff you and jim trail along
the bench fifty yards apart keep
your eyes peeled
a bright three-quarter moon
and a sky full of stars aided the
search they rode in silence jep
close to the edge of the river keen
ralston near the rise of the bank
and the bristows spread out on the
shelf the clop of hoofs and the oc-
casional clang of a shoe on a rock
was all that broke the silence twen-
ty minutes went by without a trace
of shattuck
  mighty nice night to be lookin
for a dead man jep said to himself
maybe he isnt dead though lots of
things could have happened
  but he didnt believe what he was
saying and he snapped shut his
mouth in a thin hard line he bent
forward in the saddle and his gray
eyes drilled holes in the rivers edge
  maybe he went down the other
side keens voice reached for him
through the stillness
  i dont think so jep answered
hed just have to ford the river
farther up no i reckon hes on this
side of the rake
  how come he took off for pome-
roy tonight even if one of polers
slicks did jump his claim they aint
nothin he can do about it till morn-
ing the courthouse wont open till
eight or nine
  jep rolled a cigarette the glow of
the match cast a yellow flicker across
his lean craggy face probably fig-
ured hed get the jump on poler by
leaving tonight bens probably got
a stakeout on his place poler wants
that water bad
  well shattuck never made it
lookathere jep pulled over and
keens gnarled finger pointed to
shattucks body lying in the shadow
of the bank
  jep reined up call cliff and jim
poler must be crazy shattuck never
harmed anybody he was killed just
because he was sittin across polers
creek-at least ben called his creek
-and that gun-happy thief is loco
enough to pull the same job on any-
one who gets in his way
  ralston whistled twice and cliff
bristows shout answered keens
white hair caught the moons rays
as he held his hat and knelt beside
shattucks body
  plumb between the eyes he said
in a low voice never had a chance
looks like a - hole whoever
shot him must have meen waitin in
that outcropping over yonder
  keen pointed toward the bank with
his hat and jeps gaze followed
close to the edge of the shelf at a
bend in the river was a pile or rocks
which commanded an open view for

-gun western
 yards upstream jep nodded and
headed for the rocks ralston and
the bristow brothers sat down beside
shattuck and waited for his return
only the sloshing of the river broke
the silence they were thinking of
len conway and mart haskins and
sheriff thomas-and now shattuck
  ralston threw a stone into the riv-
er reckon i was wrong about poler
layin quiet looks like well have a
little set-to with the boys the pic-
ture of aces-and-eights came to his
mind and thats okay with me no
tellin who cashes in on a dead mans
hand
in a few minutes jep reappeared
he held out his hand in his palm
lay an empty - rifle shell the
sheriffs eyes swept the three men
the granite hardness of his gaze
scraped against the steel edge of his
words
  this is polers work sure as
blazes whoever killed shattuck was
a dead shot because ben knew he
couldnt take any chances on his get-
ting away who would you say is the
best rifleman in polers outfit
  ralston spat against a white rock
and watched the brown juice slide
down the side i reckon deck koog-
lers about it i seen him knock the
spots off a trey last spring when he
won curly bettners roan
  parnell turned the shell in his
fingers i doubt that he would head
back to polers tonight-too far and
too late chances are hes holed up
someplace either waiting for the oth-
ers or fixin to head in later
  bens got a line shack about eight-
nine miles from here sets in valley
couple miles west of the rake cliff
bristows voice held a latent charge
at the thought of a showdown id
better lead the way well go down
river a piece then i know where to
cut off
  jep nodded in agreement he threw
a blanket over shattuck the tension
was mounting and he knew he might
have put all of them into a heap of
trouble poler and his gunnies
wouldnt be likely to wait and talk
first parnell kept his own coun-
sel plenty of time for such consider-
ations if the need arose no telling
which way ben would jump
  the first gray streaks of morning
found cliff bristow calling a halt
he turned in his saddle polers cab-
in sets just over that ridge we can
ride closer but theres a clearing all
around the cabin
  well go over the hill and get as
close as we can jeps voice was
clipped and ralston and the bris-
tows knew he was in command again
they rode over the rise and into the
pines covering the slope a wisp of
smoke rose from the stone chimney
eight horses saddled and ready
stood at the side of the shack
  theyre all inside jep said as he
dismounted but we cant just walk
in and open up weve got no real
proof that ben had anything to do
with shattucks death-even though
we do know it ourselves weve got
to get him to show his hand
  ralston and the bristows spread
out and took cover behind the trees
and rocks they could see both sides
of the cabin as well as the front jep
cupped his hands around his mouth
and shouted poler this is sheriff
parnell weve got the drop on you
so dont try to run ive come to take
you in for killing shattuck
  silence greeted him for three
minutes no sound came from the cab-
in then polers voice boomed up the
side of the hill you got nothin on
me sheriff i dont know anything
about shattuck or whats happened
to him i dont aim to come out and
have your boys fill me full of holes
were staying right here
  hes stallin for time-trying to
size us up ralstons low growl
carried to parnells ears better
answer him jep
  jep knew he had to gamble he
stepped into the open and held his
hands away from his gun no use
wasting time ben we found shat-
tuck before he died and he recog-
nized deck kooglers horse and that
green jacket when he rode off we
all heard him name you and koogler
besides ive got a - shell from
kooglers rifle
  a rifle cracked and dirt spurted up
between parnells feet he fell back
and threw two quick shots at the cab-
in the bristow boys and ralston
opened up as jep reached the trees
theres our answer jep gritted
dead mans hand

poler thinks weve got him dead to
rights well play hell taking him
alive without a tough fight there
are likely eight men down there any-
way and pretty soon hell know there
are only four of us
  a yell of pain and a rifle shot
pierced the air at almost the same
instant three said ken ralston
cliff bristow lurched from behind a
tree his shoulder spurting blood and
fell in a heap at his brothers feet
jim tore open his shirt and began to
tend him jep and ralston watched
from the corners of their eyes
  jim bristow looked up i think
hell be all right but he wont be
doin much shooting with that right
hand for a while damn that lousy
poler and his slicks he punctuated
his words by emptying his sixgun at
the cabin
the sun began to climb higher
in the sky both sides settled
down to await the others move only
spasmodic bursts of gunfire split the
stillness jep and the others kept
changing positions in an effort to
keep poler from knowing how few
were pitted against him
  we wont get anywhere this way
jep said as the morning wore on
pretty soon theyll come bustin out
of there and either make a run for
it or spread out and try to finish us
off keen ive got an idea its a long
shot but it just might be crazy
enough to work
  he rapidly outlined the plan to
ralston and the bristows jim
nodded and crept back to his horse
  cliff can you you throw lead with
your left hand jep asked
  i can throw it cliff replied but
i aint sayin what i can hit
  you just keep pumping if you
have to ralston and i are going
down now to visit ben   im com-
ing down to talk to you ben jep
shouted keep your boys off and
well prevent a lot of bloodshed
come ahead sheriff but keep
your hands up
  keen ralston began to crawl rapid-
ly in the brush to the cabins flank
a dusty road trailed from the clear-
ing off into the trees and up into the
hills he worked as close to the road
as he could and still remain unseen
jep walked slowly toward the cab-
in stopping ten yards before he
reached it the door was opened wari-
ly and ben poler deck koogler and
a burly gunnie stepped out in the
morning sun
  poler stood with his legs spread
wide apart im listenin sheriff
but it had better be good i know you
aint got but three men and theres
five more in the cabin right behind
us
  jep spoke slowly letting the words
sink in he was playing for high
stakes and if he lost this hand it
would be his last youre wrong
ben weve just been waiting you
out jim bristow left long ago for
pomeroy hell be back any minute
with sheriff benton and a posse and
a sworn statement that you and
koogler killed shattuck i dont fig-
ure theyll feel much like playin
youve got just five minutes to sur-
render to me or your boys will end
up in the same trouble as you and
koogler surrender now and ill see
that you all get a fair trial
an uneasy shuffling and mut-
tering came from the cabin for
jeps voice had carried as hed in-
tended to polers men they clearly
hadnt counted on this play
  youre bluffing jep polers lips
were a bloodless line he was trying
desperately to save his hide but he
knew the sands were running out
he glanced back at the cabin and
swallowed hard his adams apple
running up and down the stubbied
column of his neck you know we
can blow our way out of here and
youll go first
  so you think im bluffing looi
there jep pointed to the road above
the line of trees and hills rose a fat
cloud of dust moving rapidly such
as would be made by a large party of
riders pounding hell-for-leather
down the road
  poler swung his head around and
wet his lips his eyes dilated with
fury and he stepped back hand drop-
ping toward his gun damn you
parnell he hissed if im goin to
hell im takin you with me
  ben polers colt came up and
flame belched from the muzzle but
jeps  crashed an instant before
polers shot plowed into the dirt and

-gun western
he sank to his knees as jeps slug
dug into his side a third shot echoed
the others and deck kooglers gun
fell from his fingers keen ralstons
shot carried kooglers tag a smear
of blood grew larger on the gunmans
shirt front and his coughs brought
red foam to his lips the burly gun-
nie hadnt moved then he dropped
his sixgun and thrust his hands sky-
ward
  youve got about one minute jep
shouted to the men in the cabin he
pointed to poler who still knelt in
the dirt the blood oozing from be-
tween his fingers throw out your
guns and come out with your hands
up or youll get it just like ben and
koogler did
  the rest of polers bunch had lost
their stomachs for a fight revolvers
and rifles were thrown through the
door and windows and polers five
slicks came in a sullen file into the
clearing their eyes burned with
hatred for both jep and poler and
one kicked at his late leader keen
ralston grinning in his gray whisk-
ers took up the slack space behind
ben and his boys
  here comes your posse ben jep
waved his gun toward the road as
jim bristow charged into the little
valley on his leathered bay behind
him dragged the limb of a tree the
branches bobbing crazily and clouds
of dust rising from the few remaining
leaves
  a violent curse spurted from ben
polers lips and he tried to rise an
angry growl rose from his slicks but
they knew it was too late to make a
noon tomorrow
was held up by the bar and for a
minute his cold eyes glared at jim
blood was running from the wound
over his heart and his left hand
started up as though to staunch it
but death caught him then and his
eyes dulled and he pitched forward
and hit on his face he didnt move
again
 there was a moments silence
while the shock of the noise made by
the crashing guns wore off then
monty ferris ran around the bar
grabbed jims hand and shook it
violently you did it kid you did
it i thought you were a goner how
move jim bristow was covering them
from his horse and cliff his right
arm hanging limp had made his way
down from the pines
  a new calmness showed in jeps
face you fell for an old army trick
ben jim raised a lot of dust draggin
that tree limb and you thought it
was the posse from pomeroy dont
worry though well see that you get
a tree limb-all legal and on the table
the people in tonka city are mighty
tired of the way youve been prod-
ding this territory for five years tie
them up jim and well head back
for tonka
  it was almost twelve when jep
parnell the bristow brothers and
keen ralston stopped before the
tonka city jail and hustled ben
poler and his boys inside deck
koogler hung face downward across
the saddle a trail of blood marking
the path that led back to rake river
a dozen hands helped cliff into the
doctors office
  drinks on me boys jep flung
at ralston and jim bristow and led
the way into the mineral saloon
cliff can collect his later after the
doc patches up that shoulder
  the batwing doors swung shut be-
hind them and the three sank weari-
ly into their chairs keen ralston
idly picked up a deck of cards grim-
ly remembering the dead mans hand
jep parnell looked at the clock be-
hind the bar it was just noon exact-

  jim turned and walked from the
saloon on the walk outside he
remembered the gun which was still

by clayton fox
 grinnell reached colfax
 county after ten days of hard
 riding after leaving lassiter
 lying in the streets of bend he had
 ridden east and south as if heading
 for nevada then he had turned north
 of baker toward the grande ronde
 and idaho here again he had changed
 direction and crossed into washing-
 ton near walla walla not daring to
 cross on the ferry at alpowa he had
 swum his horse across the treacherous
 what a gun was in his
 hand grinnell was in the
 hand of fate they
 called him evil from
 dodge city to death val-
 ley but it was a brand
 that doubtless should
 have been blotted


-gun western
snake river near the mouth of the
palouse
  here in the badlands near palouse
falls he could go no further he had
not eaten in four days and had barely
slept in ten the bullet town mar-
shal lassiter had put through his side
just above the belt had left a foul
passage which had corrupted until
his whole left side was bathed in fire
at every jolt of the rawboned bronco
he had stolen in the grande ronde
  the horse battered by the long fast
miles and the terrible struggle of the
snake crossing was nearly gone
grinnell was reaching the end of the
road driven by the fate which had
goaded him without let-up for all
his forty-odd years the cards were
shuffled and dealt all he could do
was as hed always done play out the
hand
  all hed ever been from the begin-
ing when hed been lost from a wag-
on-train was the tool of fate what
a gun was in his hand he was in the
hand of destiny they called him evil
in all the west from dodge city to
death valley but evil was not a word
that applied to him the fate that
pushed him was a brutal thing cruel
and heartless grinnell simply did
what he had to do
  he rode on his battered horse
plodding head down into a gray and
shimmering world of sagebrush and
stunted jackpines far off in the
distance he could see the blue of a
pot-hole lake in a coulee water
wouldnt fill the emptiness in his
belly but it might get some of the
grime from him
  he let the horse drink first and
thirsty as it was it snorted at the
brackish alkaline water where the
tiny waves of the lake beat against
the shore there was a foam like soap-
suds the water would eat the bottom
from a tin cup in a year but it was
sweet enough for cattle to drink
  it was when he rose from dipping
his face in the lake that he saw the
house it was set back in the wall of
a grassy chute leading into the coulee
from the prairie above its front was
of pine logs daubed with clay and its
back was the wall of the chute it was
half a dugout half a house the logs
were still shiny reflecting newness
a homesteaders wagon a big stude-
baker with a tent built on it was
pulled to one side the pain of an
empty belly twisted grinnell the
homesteader might shoot him on sight
but he could go no further without
food even if he had to get it at gun-
point
there was a child playing near
the wagon he saw now and an
obscure impulse made him turn back
to the lake and scrub his face in the
stinging alkali water he got a broken
mirror and razor from his blanket roll
and set about the painful job of scrap-
ing his face free of the twelve day
beard there wasnt much he could do
about a face that would scare the
devil himself slowly he remounted
and rode around the end of the lake
  the child a boy about nine
stopped shooting at indiana with a
stick gun when grinnell rode up and
stood painfully still his bright eyes
taking in the rifle in the saddle boot
and the colt hung dragon style on
grinnells left hip
  grinnell sat his horse as was prop-
er in this country until invited to get
down your pa home boy
  the boys eyes flickered toward the
horizon and in that glance grinnell
saw that the man of the family was
gone the boy set his jaw and said
nothing
  what is it jesse a woman
called
  grinnell turned in the saddle and
saw her standing in the leather
hinged doorway a pretty woman not
yet thirty with blue eyes and blond
hair both already starting t fade
from sun and wind and loneliness
beside her within easy reach h
could see the blued barrels of a shot-
gun
  what is it she repeated sharply
are you one of bayers riders
  grinnell touched the greasy brim of
his hat no maam im a stranger in
these parts and nearly starved id
take it a most kindly act if youd sell
me some vittles
  her eyes went over him and grin-
nell could again see the image he had
seen in the broken mirror accoss the
lake a dirty scar-faced man with
blood spots from fresh shaving on his
mottled gray skin protruding un-
last card

blinking eyes and a spade shaped head
like a diamond-back rattler
  i mean you no hurt maam he
said im desperate hungry
  she nodded at last step down ive
something left from jesses dinner
grinnell dismounted slowly and
carefully so as to not alarm her
the boy jesse was still regarding
him with the distrust of people who
live lonely lives but he was taken by
the gunbelt on grinnell and it would
not be long before he made some
friendly overture grinnell had no
feeling for children he could not re-
member having been one himself
when he had been this boys age he
had been driving with a freighting
outfit
  out of long habit his eyes searched
the surrounding screen of coulee
walls before he hunkered down to
wait for the food he was a long way
from missouri river bottom land
where he had started and still every-
thing was the same he was hungry
dirty and still wary of the kick which
would come if he wasnt fast on the
dodge
  over the years he had acquired a
name-his last from a freighter who
had picked him off the streets of st
louis-the first slick had been ac-
quired in abilene when he had
dropped a tough texas rancher with
a hideout  derringer the thing
that went with the name slick grin-
nell a reputation for fast and deadly
and cold-blooded murder had been
acquired in a dozen tough places
even the woman in there might have
heard of slick grinnell if she knew
who he was he would have been
covered with the shotgun from the
time he rode on the place
the woman came to the door again
come in and set down it aint much
but itll keep body and soul together
i can eat out here maam grin-
nell said
  sit down at the table she said
grinnell went in and sat
down at a table made of split
logs soft wood cottonwood he saw
it would soon fall apart he had seen
these homesteaders move in on the
rim of cattle ranches before they
came stubbornly seeking out their
hundred-sixty acres of land worked
like demons night and day and in
two or three years went on to another
bright promise leaving decaying
buildings and home-made furniture
like this behind them
  it irritated him always the people
with their hopes and dreams pitting
themselves against insurmountable
odds there was no use pitying them
they would not listen to reason
  the woman put a steaming plate of
beans and some cold corn bread in
front of him the faint odor of mo-
lasses tinted the smell of the beans
turning grinnell weak and ravening
he seized his knife and began to
scoop up the beans shoveling them
into his mouth in a steady stream he
did not slow down until all the beans
were gone then he sopped up the
remaining juice on his plate with the
cornbread
  the boy was staring at him wide-
eyed maw he said in an urgent
voice he eats with his knife j
hush jesse the woman said
embarrassed
  i bet hes one of bayers riders
theyre all hogs
  jesse im sorry mister its pret-
ty hard to strap manners into a wild
boy
  grinnell smiled a remote bleak
flicker of expression nobody
learned me bettern to eat with a
knife until i was too old to change
he was acutely embarrassed for some
reason and wanted to change the sub-
ject who is this bayer
  this land used to be indian re-
serve the woman said bayer used
to pay the indians a dollar an acre to
herd his cattle on here now the gov-
ernment has thrown it open for
filing and bayer wants to keep it
hes brought in all the hardcases they
have run out of lewiston and walla
walla
 theyve got a sheriff in the
county aint they grinnell asked
  sheriff she said scornfully
bayers own man the county com-
missioners are all cattlemen when
the old sheriff died the commission-
ers appointed this new man
  i see grinnell said a sheriff was
the last man he wanted to see he
rose and tilted his hat forward over
his eyes again he was feeling the
old irritation at helpless people who
s
-gun western
did not believe they were helpless
there was no hope for these people
lately in wyoming hed hired out
his gun to the cattlemen fighting back
a wave of settlers the fight had been
bloody and the homesteaders beaten
here with a handpicked sheiiff the
homesteaders had no chance at all
they could not fight the run of the
cards
  he reached in his pocket for a half-
eagle he shook his head at the wom-
ans quick protest for feeding a
stranger even if you was afraid
  the boy walked to his horse with
him jesses eyes were on the bone
handle of the pistol you like guns
boy
  i got a dollar the boy said you
want to sell that gun mister
  afraid i couldnt get along with-
out it grinnell said what do you
need a gun for
  maybe the indians will come
snooping around i could shoot bayer
and his whole gang of mangy riders
too
  grinnell chuckled you save that
fight boy you may need it
  he looked down at the house when
his horse had climbed to the top of
the grassy chute again he felt irri-
tated at their helpless stubbornness
bayer and his handpicked riders
would force them to move and they
would go on and on pushed by the
same bitter fate that pushed him
by nightfall he had ridden
several miles to the north without
seeing another human being the des-
ert had given way to the deep soil of
the palouse hills and the wild grass
rolling in the wind brushed at his
hips as he rode through at sundown
a sage hen ran through the grass be-
fore him dragging a wing in imitation
injury grinnell took a quick glance
at one of the balls of fluff which were
her chicks decided they were old
enough to fend for themselves and
blew off her head with his forty-four
  before dark he descended to the
palouse river gathered a few limbs
and roasted the sage hen on a stick
the meat was tough and stringy and
tasted strongly of sage supper over
he untied his horses picket rope from
a sage and retied it to his wrist then
he lay with his head on the saddle
covering himself with the stinking
saddle blanket and with his pistol in
his hand fell into a profound sleep
  he was awakened some time later
about midnight he judged by the
slow wheel of stars to the sound of
a half-dozen horses trotting some-
where up on the coulee rim he lay
tensed head lifted with his pistol
cocked until the sound of the horses
died out in the distance
  he awoke again in the first silver
light of dawn with the sharp feeling
that something had gone wrong he
did not move other than to put his
thumb over the pistol hammer
 you can quit playing possum
slick right now youre cold turkey
a faintly amused voice said
  grinnell sat up slowly tilting the
gun barrel toward the sound of the
voice as he did so
  dont try it
  grinnell pulled his hand from un-
der the blanket shorty morcross
he said aint seen you since wyo-
ming
  the short man sitting in the saddle
with the carbine centered on grin-
nells chest grinned with mirth the
name is dyke ted dyke slick
shorty morcross never got out of
wyoming he pointed to his chest
ted dyke is sheriff of colfax
county
  grinnell shook his head as if to
clear it i must be asleep shorty i
thought you said sheriff his mind
was busy with the play if there was
big enough reward posted for him in
oregon shorty wouldnt waste much
time before shooting
  slick shorty said youre in a
mighty bad spot
  grinnell said nothing tensing his
muscles for a try at his gun it would
be useless shorty was no amateur
and he could put three bullets
through him before he got his hand
under the blanket
  colfax county used to be tough
shorty said right now theyre look-
ing over every strange rider that
comes in generally they issue a
request to keep on riding
  grinnell sat straighter trying to
postpone the moment when shorty
would pull the trigger
  dont reach for that gun slick i
last card

could start even and still beat you
im giving you a good chance we
might just forget we ever saw each
other before your name is maybe
jake brown i can use a good deputy
for a month or so
  new way of livin for me grin-
nell said relief poured through him
like pure sweet water you got a
dodger on me mr dyke
  no probably get it a couple of
days after you ride out im surprised
at you slick in the old days a man
couldnt get within a mile of where
you was sleeping
  we all get old grinnell said
for a minute there i thought i
wasnt going to get any older the
people of this county know what kind
of lawdog they got
  shorty smiled his mirthless gri-
mace only one person in this county
whose opinion is worth a damn his
name is bayer big rancher well ride
by his ranch on the way to town
 i	never knowed the time you
needed help shorty
  a man cant have eyes everywhere
these homesteaders will fight for
this rich land some of them are
pretty tough you might say youre
insurance for me just like im insur-
ance for mr bayer lets ride depu-
ty
bayers ranch was on a hill over-
looking the river grinnell when
the horses splashed across the shallow
ford saw a blacksmith hard at work
in the shop a rifle leaning against the
forge three men were working at
the corral repairing cinch straps but
behind them were three more rifles
new from their appearance the
house itself was set back against the
hill and was made of fieldstone heav-
ily mortared together the full length
porch commanded a view of the en-
tire valley behind the house up on
the rim more riders were hazing
eome horses the bayers ranch was
set for trouble it would take a small
army to get at bayer
  one of the men at the corral had
stopped hammering rivets into a strap
and was carefully inspecting his rifle
as shorty and grinnell rode up
shorty jerked a thumb at grinnell
new deputy name of jake brown
he said parker nichols foreman of
the bar b jake bayer at home
 up at the cookshack getting
breakfast if the cook is in a good
mood maybe you can get some grub
too
  bayer a heavy red-faced man of
forty was seated alone in the cook-
shack mornin sheriff he said
whos your boy
  this side of the line his name is
jake brown
  bayer speared a slice of ham he
aint very pretty is he useful
hell get the job done
  bayers cold gaze rested on grin-
nell you boys represent the law i
want the homesteaders off the indian
strip i dont want a federal marshal
down here nosing around afterward
if youre wanted in other states get
the job done and get out of here
he turned back to his ham and eggs
 how about some breakfast mr
bayer shorty asked
 dont anybody ever eat before
they come out here plates are on
the side table
  grinnell was famished again the
meal he had got at the homesteaders
and the sage hen he had eaten the
night before had barely taken a wrin-
kle out of his hunger he loaded a
plate with the ham and eggs and filled
a mug with coffee from the back of
the big range the ham was beginning
to dry out and the eggs were greasy
cold but he grabbed a knife and be-
gan to take the slack from his empty
stomach
  bayer pushed his chair back and
stood up grinnell stopping to refill
his coffee cup noted he wore choke-
bore riding pants and hand-tooled
boots and that he carried a short-
barreled gun in a specially tailored
hip pocket
  bayer grimaced at shorty your
friend may be a curly wolf but he
eats like a hog next time feed him
outside he turns my stomach
shorty laid a lightning-fast hand on
grinnells arm take it easy slio-k
he said
  bayer stared at grinnell with con-
tempt but grinnell could see the
nervous flicker of his eyes
  outside they mounted and turned
their horses up the valley toward pal-
ouse city shorty seemed worried by

-gun western
grinnells silence hell i wouldnt
let what bayer said bother me he
said hes been top dog in this coun-
try a long time he just didnt know
who he was talking to
  grinnell turned his bleak gaze on
him dont worry about bayer he
said i never kill anybody unless im
paid for it
early evening filled the valley
around palouse city with plum-
colored light when grinnell awak-
ened from an afternoons sleep after
riding into town he had checked in
at shortys office and then had bed-
ded down in one of the bunks in the
back of the livery barn now he went
to the barber shop and bought a hot
bath in which he soaked the grime
from his body and some of the poison
from the bullet gouge in his side the
wound looked purple and poisonous
he should have had a doctor look at
it his dirt-encrusted clothing felt
strange after the bath so he sent a
boy to the store for new overalls and
a shirt he put them on and had a
close shave and haircut then he
sauntered on to supper smelling
strongly of new clothing and bay rum
  his steak and apple pie eaten he
went back to the courthouse to re-
port to shorty there were two other
deputies walters a blowhard who
would crack in a tight and a heavy-
shouldered man named spear who
had been the town marshal a good
man for shouldering drunks out of
the way but too slow-witted to be a
gunfighter grinnell pegged him as
the man to rough the homesteaders
when they were in town
  heres the deal shorty said
you spear and walters patrol the
town some of bayers riders will be
in theyll be tough with homestead-
ers most of the farmers wont fight
he grinned theyre married men
with wives and families they cant af-
ford to fight but there are always
one or two young bucks who think
theyre tough or have to impress their
lady friends those are the men well
leave to jake brown that clear
  the night shadows were as thick
and black as boiled coffee wherever
the yellow lamplight did not reach
grinnell stolidly walked the length of
the street to where the two branches
  of the palouse flowed together the
creeks rustled faintly over the stones
and he was surprised to hear a boom-
ing rush as of awaterfall it took him
minutes of listening before he re-
alized the sound was of the wind
rushing over acres and acres of head-
high grass up on the rim this pal-
ouse soil he realized if it grew grass
that tall would grow wheat beyond
any farmers wildest dream he did
not know how long bayer could hold
back the farmers from the country
it would not be long it was only the
first homesteaders who would suffer
those who came after would find
courts and churches and impartial
sheriffs it was inevitable as inevi-
table as the fate which would lead the
bolder of them to die in the streets of
palouse under his guns the west-
ward settlements were the same al-
ways repeated and repeated and re-
peated
  grinnell wheeled and paced up the
crooked street to its final turning to
the road to lewiston it was quiet to-
night but tomorrow was saturday
the homesteaders and bayers hands
would be in town bayer and shorty
were set for violence and he was the
gun in their hands
  it would take a cool hand and
steady nerves a professional gun-
fighter he did not fear there it was a
question of nerve and hairline guess-
ing about another mans reactions it
was the amateurs he had to worry
about some farmer who never before
had a gun in his hands might be
lucky he went back to the livery
stable and rolled into his bunk
e awoke to a cloudless satur-
day morning with an ache in all
his joints and the coppery taste of
fever in his mouth the ease and well-
being he felt the afternoon before had
left him his motions were sluggish
and his head ached steadily
  he inquired of a boy the where-
abouts of a doctor and the boy
pointed to a house four doors away
the doctor an untidy man with the
stains of his morning coffee on his
shirtfront was seated on the porch
absorbing the sunshine
  the doctor took a quick glance at
the wounded side then looked at
grinnells eyes and checked his pulse
last card

  my friend youre in bad shape
he said you do any more riding with
that wound and youll fall off your
horse for good you better stay here
in town and get yourself a homestead
out on the indian strip you lie
around for a month doing nothing
then you can prove your homestead
youve got a lot of poison in your
system
  is it that easy to get a homestead
grinnell asked
  why not this countrys got a
great future-a great future you got
time to see the garden ive planted in
back
  some other time doc grinnell
paid the doctor his fifty cents he
was remembering the homesteaders
place by the pothole lake a nice
place to stop and let the rest of his
years run out a place like that-or
that place after he and shorty had
moved the homesteaders family on
as long as bayer and shorty were in
power in the country he would be
safe and he could help keep them in
power
  his headache was worse he wished
that he had dared ask the doctor
for some painkiller but a dose of
laudanum would make him too slow
and draggy for the business at hand
he took a seat on the bench in front
of the main store not far from the
hitchrack which was already lined
with horses wearing bayers cross b
brand out at the end of the street
there were three farm wagons the
horses unhitched and munching hay
from the wagon boxes
  after a time bayer rode into town
with his foreman nichols he tied his
high-stepping kentucky horse to the
hitch-rack took a quick hard look at
grinnell then went across the street
to the pastime in three minutes
shorty the sheriffs star gleaming on
his chest strolled down the street
and disappeared into the saloon after
bayer further down grinnell could
see spear and walters patrolling
  the cards were shuffled and dealt
the hand was ready to be played out
the farmers would push into the
stacked deck they would blam bay-
er and shorty and grinnell not
knowing that they too were merely
players uselessly playing the hands
they got
  near ten oclock two wagons came
into town from downriver the first
one held the woman and the boy
jesse who had fed him by the pothole
lake the man holding the reins was
tall and dark-haired with bulky
shoulders and a tough square set to
his jaw he drove directly to the
hitch-rack he stepped down untied
bayers fiddlefooted kentucky horse
and moved it up the rack to make
room for his team
  the damned fool grinnell thought
hes pushing himself harder than
he has to if he ran maybe he could
get out of it alive hes got the wife
and the boy to think about
  but then he thought wearily what
difference will it make the pride
would ride with the farmer wherever
he went and the woman had probably
been attracted to him because of it
what had made her a wife might
make her a widow if not here then
somewhere else
grinnell felt a moments admir-
ation for the farmer then again
pity no matter how brave a show he
made of it he was beat
  the two young farmers brothers
by their look in the wagon behind
had driven directly to the hardware
store one of them held the team
while the other went inside grinnell
saw spear and walters bearing down
on the wagon and the play was clear
in his mind he had seen it a hundred
times before in a hundred different
ways different but always the same
bayer must have decided that these
two and the broad-shouldered married
farmer were the kingpins who must
be driven out or killed
  spear and walters wheeled in con-
cert and sat down on the bench in
front of the hardware store the
farmer a red-headed fair-skinned
swede glanced at them then returned
to his moody contemplation of the
dashboard
  from where he sat grinnell could
not hear what spear and walters
were saying but it was apparent they
were enjoying it the farmers face
already sun-reddened turned a bright
scarlet the sound of spears un-
melodious bray drifted up the street
  just as the other brother appeared
in the doorway with a gunny-sack of

-gun western
supplies the farmer in the wagon
dived between his feet and came up
with a rifle he was fast the carbine
was halfway to his shoulder before
spear and walters could get un-
tracked walters made an ineffective
grab for his gun as spear bumped the
man in the door
  grinnell hurled himself to his feet
and drew his pistol in the same mo-
tion it was an impossibly long shot
for a pistol but he sighted and fired
the shot was high the heavy slug
caught the farmer in the shoulder and
knocked him from the wagon seat he
fell between the wagon-box and
wheel which saved his life walters
had finally got his gun clear of its
holster spear had pinioned the arms
of the brother
  hold it grinnell shouted he
plodded down the street to them feel-
ing the steady throb of his fevered
blood behind his eyes
  walters was looking down at his
gun a foolish smile on his face spear
looked stunned as if what had been a
rude game had suddenly exploded be-
yond belief the farmer spear had
grabbed slammed himself free with
his elbows and went to assist his
brother
  there was a quick rustle of skirts
as the homesteaders wife ran to the
wounded man
  axel are you all right
  axel grimaced from pain smashed
a shoulder
  doctor up the street grinnell
said get your shoulder fixed and
either get out of colfax county or
go on trial for assaulting a peace
officer
  the woman turned on him so you
are one of bayers pet curs im
sorry i wasted food on you the other
day i should have fed it to the hogs
theres no reason for a man like you
living
  grinnell looked at her blankly
  shorty strutted over importantly
from the pastime a little trouble
jake
  our friend went for spear and
walters with a rifle i had to cool him
off
  shorty looked not at the brothers
but at the farmers wife we are giv-
ing you the same orders we give all
troublemakers in colfax county get
your wagon rolling and dont stop
this side of the line
  so thats it she said we move
out and tomorrow you or some other
dog of bayers files on our land why

away tears streaking the faint layer
of dust on her face grinnell watch-
ing her saw the boy jesse standing a
few feet away his eyes wide and
frightened well it was a tougli world
and the boy might as well learn it now
as later jesse reached out and took
his mothers hand as they trailed back
to the wagon
  grinnell his head floating from
fever watched the husband running
to them the woman went to his arms
while the boy jesse stood close not
understanding the violence which
outstripped his wildest dreams of
indian battles
  the farmer finally pushed his wife
away and wheeled toward the pas-
time it was then grinnell saw the
pistol stuck in the waistband of his
overalls
  bayer and nichols were watching
from the saloon door the last card
had been played the last part of the
design put in it was exactly as grin-
ell had known it would go there was
no escape

  grinnell lifted the rifle and in that
moment rebellion overtook him it
was his chance to spit in the eye of
destiny
  shorty you always thought you
was faster than me nows the time to
find out
  shorty looked not understanding
  im changing sides shorty
  shorty had his gun clear of the
holster and half-raised when grin-
nells-bullet hit him in the throat
  grinnell whirled on walters and
spear stay out of this or youre
dead he said he leveled the carbine
  his first shot lifted a spout of dust
in front of the farmer his second
shot jerked the batwing door to the
right of bayer the rancher and
nichols turned and dived into the
saloon

rotten bellys sad siege
by noel m loomis
rotten belly was one of
the great chiefs of the crows
a savage fighter friendly to-
ward the whites and of unquenchable
pride and spirit he was forced by his
tribe into an adventure for which he
had no heart and at the end he told
his people to keep peace with the
white man forever after
  rotten belly first appears in 
when he met general henry atkin-
son at one of the mandan villages
  congress had passed a law to au-
thorize treaties with the tribes on the
missouri river and president monroe
appointed a commission headed by
atkinson the commission established
headquarters at one of the mandan
villages in what is now western north
dakota and sent out runners to the
surrounding tribes
inviting them to
come to the village
to make treaties
there would of
course be gifts in
celebration and
medals to be hung
around the necks
of the chiefs
there would be
many pipes
smoked and per-
haps a few surrep-
titious nips at the
bottle
  the normal headquarters of the
crows was somewhat west of the
mandans but they sent a delegation
headed by rotten belly who was
then about thirty-six years old tall
dignified of splendid physique ad-
mired for his unquestioned bravery
and considered quite humane for a
man raised under savage conditions
  atkinsons effort was successful
for he concluded a treaty with the
crows on august  and it is interest-
ing to note that the united states
promised not to furnish arms to any
enemies of the crows inasmuch as
the crows fought the blackfeet the
shoshones the assiniboines the
gros ventres and from time to time
practically every other tribe in the
area it would seem to pose a problem
in administration-especially so since
similar treaties were also made with
the other tribes
  the story of the siege of fort mc-
kenzie the farthest northwest out-
post in the united states for at that
time the west coast was spanish and
british begins in april  when
a party of three blood blackfeet
warriors and one squaw came to the
fort announcing themselves as a war
party headed for crow country on a
horse-stealing expedition
 major alexander culbertson in
charge of fort mckenzie talked them
out of the idea and they started back
the fort was pro-
visioned guns
cleaned balls
poured a guard
established and
then the savage
crows came thun-
dering in armed to
the teeth   
but a few miles north thirty crows
rode down upon them as they were
enjoying a smoke and with their con-
centrated fire killed two of the braves
and wounded the third
 the wounded blood however
knocked a crow from his horse with
a single sweep of his rifle leaped on
the horse seized a lance and gal-
loped away he was fortunate in hav-
ing taken an unusually good horse
and so he reached the fort but the
squaw who was his sister was still
in the hands of the crows
 the crows rode hard toward the
south guarding the squaw with care
her clothing was taken away from


-gun western
her at night and she was forced to
sleep with a crow squaw who awoke
at the lift of an eyelash the blood
woman had no chance to escape until
she was several days away then a
storm came up one night and she es-
caped she found herself in an enemy
country without food or weapons
and completely naked she traveled
five days under a blazing sun and
through rugged mountains where
water froze at night back toward the
fort
tyjajor culbertson guided
ivi by the squaws brother had re-
turned to the scene of the tragedy and
recovered the bodies for burial then
one evening he saw movement in the
brush on the opposite side of the riv-
er he crossed in a rowboat and to his
amazement found the squaw who had
been taken away by the crows she
was naked except for bunches of sage-
brush tied on her body her feet were
cut and bleeding from the long days
of hard travel through stones and
prickly pear cactus and she was gaunt
from exposure weariness and hun-
ger
  culbertson took her across the river
to the fort gave her food and cloth-
ing and was astonished to hear her
say that the crows were preparing a
heavy attack against the fort with the
intention of destroying it this was
the attack made against rotten bel-
lys desire and it is necessary to un-
derstand the indians practice when
a brave becomes a war leader he is
to some extent subject to the wishes
of the tribe he may decline to lead
them on some raids but if the senti-
ment of the tribe is strong he cannot
so decline without losing face and
most indian warriors would go to cer-
tain death rather than lose standing
 a band of crows drove thirty
horses away from the fort but this
was not the attacking party how-
ever it was crow custom to send
scouting parties ahead when they
planned a movement of any size to
be sure they would not run foul of
the blackfeet their deadly enemies
therefore when a second band of
crows appeared culbertson knew the
squaws story was about to be borne
out
  the fort was provisioned rifles
were cleaned and balls were poured
the fort had two bastions with a
three-pound cannon in each and they
were put in readiness for service and
supplied with powder and balls a
guard was established water was
available and the fort was equipped
to sustain an indefinite attack against
any number of indians except for one
item-food the fort depended pri-
marily on wild game for sustenance
and in fact one man was hired as post
hunter for this purpose but game was
scarce in the vicinity and with the
horses gone the amount of meat pro-
cured by foot-hunters was far less
than needed
  in june the crows appeared they
made a camp about  yards away
and a large contingent well armed
came to the gate and demanded ad-
mittance culbertson asked about the
horses but got no satisfactory answer
it was apparent that the crows were
bent on war and he ordered them
away warning them that if they came
to the fort armed he would have his
men fire on them he showed them
the blood squaw who had escaped
and they were astonished thinking
that she had died
  so the siege began without a shot
the crows were alert and on the
prowl so that the post was surround-
ed but culbertson kept a constant
guard and the crows were careful
not to come within range with their
weapons
  the fort was almost on the river
but the crows were watchful cul-
bertson had a well dug within the
stockade so no one would have to go
outside for he knew that rotten bel-
lys people were looking for an excuse
to start an assault in force they
struck water ten feet down
  their fresh meat lasted two days
dried meat lasted two days more
then the dogs were killed and eaten
  finally they boiled the parfleches-
containers of raw buffalo hide which
cooked up in a mess that resembled
carpenters glue
  now alexander harvey a promi-
nent company man demanded permis-
sion to shoot the indians they could
not stay shut up in the stockade and
starve he said
rotten bellys sad siege

xtajor culbertson though
only twenty-five years old real-
ized the necessity of avoiding open
warfare with the powerful orows
the crows did not trade at fort mc-
kenzie but if they took a notion
they could wreck the blackfeet trade
-and that would put the post out of
business
 the same harvey found this out
ten years later at the same fort
  but culbertsons hand was forced
for harvey planned with some of the
men to take the boat at night and
leave the fort culbertson therefore
notified rotten belly that if the
crows did not leave by noon he
would open hostilities and hurl
thunderbolts upon them rotten belly
laughed
 the three-pounder in the upper
bastion was charged with ball and
aimed at the crow camp at exactly
noon it crashed and the heavy shot
went through the middle of the camp
  rotten belly laughed no longer
nor did the crows who had insisted
on this expedition linger there was
shouting and turmoil lodges came
down horses were mounted lodge
skins were thrown on the backs of
pack horses the crows did not use
the travois and soon the entire vil-
lage was strung out along the river-
all going upstream away from the
fort
  a few of them crossed the river
and fired some shots at the fort but
without damage the siege was over
  the crows said later that they had
never intended to hurt the garrison
they had merely wanted to destroy
the fort which supplied their enemies
with rifles and ammunition it was
an easy thing to say-as easy per-
haps as it had been for the white men
to say they would not supply such
arms to enemies of the crows
  rotten belly had been shamed his
large party of warriors had been put
to rout by a single shot never mind
that it was a cannon his shame was
great and he now called on them to
follow him in blackfeet country
where they might take some scalps
and wipe out this disgrace
  he got volunteers and they start-
ed out but they did not fight black-
feet near fort benton at a place
called goose bill they ran into twelve
warriors of the gros ventres rotten
belly called on his crows to attack
  we shall see who are brave men
he said i shall lead this attack al-
though i do not think that i shall
live
  the crows charged the gros ven-
tres and took exactly twelve scalps
but the gros ventres were fighters
too and rotten belly received a fatal
wound tell my people he said be-
fore he died to keep peace with the
whites hereafter there must be no
more war between them
  the dying chiefs words were heard
and remembered for the crow nation
never again took up arms against the
white man	 end
last card
  grinnell emptied the magazine of
the rifle through the doors after them
if he had judged bayer right the
rancher would stay belly-down in the
sawdust for some time to come
  he was weary it was an effort to
force his feet to move to the hitch-
rack where bayers kentucky horse
was dancing
  the farmer still held his pistol
puzzled grinnell turned to the wom-
an get word to the u s marshal at
spokane falls grinnell said tell
him bayer had shorty morcross and
slick grinnell in here as lawdogs
but-why the wonian asked and
contd from page 
he knew she was talking about the
change
  i dont know he answered i
dont know exactly  mighty pretty
place you got there though by the
lake
  he mounted the kentucky horse
and pointed it toward the rim where
the tall grass grew on the horizon
were the hills of idaho where he
could find a spring and rest awhile
the horse could find its way back
  the fever was high in his blood and
he started to grin no matter if the
cards were marked a man could up-
set the deal	end
two or three
funerals
by d aydelotte
it looked to buck sizemore
riding up the main cowpath of
mustang as if the town was get-
ting to be real civilized there were
a few more shacks and dugouts and
instead of only the two saloons-the
wild horse and the black wolf-
various business establishments now
spread all up and down the street
  after this last long stretch on his
ranch in the lonesome reaches of no
mans land buck was cheered to see
the note of progress it did seem
queer though not to find a single
cowpony waiting at a hitchrack nor
anyone along the main street
  and tradys feed barn where buck
went to put up his pony was deserted
too no sign of even limpy horton
tilted back in his favorite chair but
as buck led the sorrel to a stall he
discovered at last a sign of life a
powdering of dust filtering down
 there were no courts in
 no mans land no law
 except that of the sixgun
 and yet buck sizemore
 wondered if civilization
 hadnt begun to reach
 this raw frontier
hows tricks
 there aint no tricks answered
the barkeep gloomily and you better
find you a hole and crawl in it un-
shirted hells liable to bust loose here
any minute he pushed bottle and
glass toward buck and propped one
elbow on the bar
 thinking back to that sifting of
dust from the barn loft buck decided
to play innocent i just this minute
hove in he explained searing his
gullet with a drink whats going
on
 youll know soon enough hinted
anse leaning near he whispered
thompson and two others mebbe
wont see the sun come up tomorrow
the viglance committees after em
that being the case drawled
buck ill mosey on to gus wil-
lards and lay low
 stepping outside he saw ed mun-
from a crack in the loft floor almost
certainly this meant that someone was
hiding up there but in buck size-
mores code of etiquette it wouldnt
be polite to inquire who so he got
feed and water for his pony gave the
animal a parting slap on the flank
and left without looking back
  he was the one lone customer at
the wild horse and his spurs clat-
tered loudly in the empty room it
wasnt healthy for a cowtown saloon
to be so quiet that time of day even
thompson the gambler wasnt at his
usual table riffling a deck of greasy
cards
 howdy anse hailed buck
ger walking down the middle of the
street holding a winchester and
looking both ways trailing him were
four men all toting rifles and seem-
ing itchy to use them buck dodged
back inside
 kinda crowded out there he
grinned last time i saw ed mun-
ger thompson had got the drop on
him and made him dance and there
was ed with his hands up kicking
sand fit to kill he didnt much like
the tinhorn after that
  eds been bound to get even said
anse and this here claim-jumpin
give him his chance to put it on
thompson

two or three funerals

  as one of the posse turned in at
the swingdoor anse fell silent and
began busily polishing the bar
  howdy greeted the guntoter
then staring suspiciously at buck
what you doin here
  just got in from the ranch an-
swered buck and stopped here for
a slug of red-eye to warm me up
then im going on to gus willards
if you go there growled the
man be sure to stay inside you
hear
  buck was no stranger to violence
he had been in the thick of more than
one running fight with cattle rus-
tlers yet he felt a chill prickling
down his spine as a few minutes
later he walked along the street with
four men on his heels old man wil-
lard met him at the door of his little
shack
  come right in he called and
rest your hat while i warm up tle
beans and cawfee i been waitin ever
since i heard youd hit town
  first time in my life drawled
buck closing the door behind him
that i ever had an armed escort
those fellers must think a lot of me
they seen you go to tracys
barn said gus and they been here
askin about you
  i dont see what for puzzled his
guest whats back of all this ki-
hootin anyway
  plenty said old gus cryptically
come on set up to the table and
ill tell you later on
  at the crash of gunfire buck was
on his feet reaching for his gun
im not going to set here like a
plumb coward while theres shootin
going on
  you step outside warned gus
and youre liable to run into a bul-
let therell be two r three funerals
tomorrow and thats enough
  after another roaring fusillade
silence and darkness closed in upon
the little town
  later there was a knock at gus
willards door the old man started
up in his bunk but buck opened
the door six-gun in hand
  did you see limpy horton at the
barn asked one of the posse
  not a sign of him when i went
there answered buck
  well growled his inquisitor we
knew hes there and were goin to root
him out they made off grumbling
among themselves
  what they got against poor lim-
py asked buck
  nothing said the old man only
he worked for tracy and they figger
he might talk too much
the trouble had begun when
one-eye george came to mustang
and bought a claim at the south edge
of town paying a few hundred down
and the balance mebbeso-tomorrow
instead of living on his land to help
prove up he got a job at the black
wolf saloon and slept in the back
room
  three men-bennet the storekeep-
er tracy who ran the feed barn and
thompson the gambler-put their
heads together and decided to run
one-eye off so thompson put up a
tent at one corner of the claim and
when one-eye warned of what was
going on showed up and claimed
possession he was driven off at gun-
point being mild-mannered and a
bad shot besides the luckless fellow
stayed away
  there were no courts in no mans
land no law except that of self-de-
fense you might say that the law
ended at a mans front door in mus-
tang a man couldnt be arrested no
matter what hed done there was
no jail to hold him no judge to try
him no jury to convict him only
horse and cattle thieves when caught
were punished-by the law of hemp
a rope slung over a limb of the near-
est tree
  claim-jumping was generally con-
sidered a nuisance rather than a
serious crime but the high-handed
tactics of the thompson trio gave ed
munger his chance to finally square
things with the hated gambler whod
made him dance to the song of bullets
cutting aroud his feet and as ben-
net and tracy were in on the land
deal they had to be dealt with also
  about sundown while buck size-
more was having supper at old man
willards the five man self-appointed
vigilance committee headed for
thompsons tent they met their
man leaving a place where hed had
supper one of the posse fired but
the shot fell short

-gun western
  better raise your sights advised
their target coolly the next bullet
came closer and the gambler for once
unarmed but defiant neeringly told
them to try again the third shot
struck him in the kneecap he spun
around and fell but managed to
crawl back to the one-room half-dug-
out where the landlady was hiding in
terror
  instead of finishing off their vic-
tim then and there the posse went
on to bennets store the door was
locked the building dark but after
repeated pounding with gun butts
the storekeeper came to the door
holding a lighted lantern
  whats up he asked shakily
  thompson wants to see you said
ed munger he says youre back of
the trouble over one-eye george
  hes mistaken said bennet but
ill go see him anyway as he turned
to get his coat and hat one of the
men ordered you come right now
 they tramped down the snowy
street bennet hatless and coatless
his thumbs by order hooked in the
armholes of his vest
  at the dugout thompson was ly-
ing on a cot his knee swathed in
bandages half-conscious he opened
his eyes and tried to speak then he
fell back twenty-three bullets rid-
dling his body screeching in panic
the landlady fled into the night
  its your turn bennet said
munger you deserve to die for
stealing one-eyes claim a bullet
crashed through bennets brain he
fell dead near the bloodsoaked bed
where thompson lay
  the posse then rode on to settle
with tracy but when they reached
his place the feed-barn man had his
light buggy hitched up and he and
his wife were ready to drive off
  halt or well shoot the posse
shouted bullets whined through the
air but tracy laid the whip to his
team and left on a dead run at the
first kansas town they came to he
begged for protection and he and
his wife slept in the jail that night
 next morning as buck stood in
front of old man willards a wagon
came along drawn by a yoke of
steers a boy driving two armed
men walked on either side ed mun-
ger following behind seeing two
long narrow boxes in the wagon
buck called if you need help with
the grave-digging ill come along
come on jeered a guard and
well bury you on top of the boxes
much obliged said buck polite-
ly but ive changed my mind
 ed munger was hanging around
at the feed barn when buck went to
get his pony did you see limpy
here yesterday he quizzed
 i told you before answered
buck i didnt see a soul
  well he was here all right said
munger grimly hiding up in the
loft we made him come out then
we paid him off give him a good
hoss and told him he better go
where it was healthier he lit out
buck made no answer he saddled
the sorrel and rode away not even
stopping at the wild horse saloon
for a parting drink mustang looked
more natural with men going into
the saloons and ponies waiting out-
side but as buck headed for the
snowy stretches of his ranch in no
mans land he wondered if the
town had got such a big dose of civ-
ilization after all	 end

tom kelsey had been so sure
of winning that his eager fin-
gers were already dragging in
the pot before lew hatton had a
chance to spread his own cards upon
the green-covered table when he saw
the hand that beat his own however
the rancher stopped he studied the
cards with worried blue eyes and
then slowly he pushed the chips
back into the center of the table and
said guess i was a little sud-
den he even tried to smile a
little but the result was some-
thing that looked very sick
  lew hatton didnt smile
he never permitted himself
that luxury when he was
lew hatton had seen men
bullet-blasted crumple to
the dust before his six-
guns but this was one
blood-hungry gent hed
have liked to lose the
draw to 
   kelsey was an easy mark for the gambler
working his sallow face with its
clipped mustache and closely-lidded
eyes never changed expression he

owner was fidgeting a bit uncertain-
ly a frown on his homely red-burnt
face as he eyed hatton he opened
his mouth hesitantly said im-im
afraid ill have to ask you to let me
sign some more paper hatton i put
a little more than i had into that
pot- 
the gambler looked at him sharply
without a word he put down the

	-gun
cards he was shuffling without a
word eased his lean frame out of the
chair went over to a closed door and
threw it open
  a swart paunchy individual in
shirt sleeves and arm bands looked up
from behind a battered desk this
was spade pierce owner of the red
rooster he eyed hatton through the
smoke of a cigar that was stuck in his
slitted mouth
  kelsey wants to make another
note boss hatton said you told me
to let you know
  a gleam as of anticipated pleasure
sprang into the narrow eyes of the
man at the desk he took the cigar
out of his mouth and put it in an ash
tray the chewed end dripping saliva
his puffy hands rubbed together soft-
ly send him in he directed send
mr kelsey right in
  hatton nodded shortly came out of
the office closing the door behind
him going back to the table he
glanced at the rancher with an eye-
brow raised and indicated the door
youll have to see pierce he said
  kelsey looked like a dog that knows
it is going to be whipped slowly he
got to his feet he looked at the eyes
around him and saw them all turned
away or merely staring at him with
helpless sympathy with an effort
the rafter k owner straightened his
shoulders and walked into spade
pierces office bearing the air of a
doomed man
  the game broke up all at once the
other players mumbled excuses and
got up pushing back their chairs with
a shuffling of feet they didnt look
at hatton squarely the gambler
shrugged and cashed their chips for
them without comment
  he knew of course what they were
thinking no one ever lost any love
on a house dealer and he had long ago
grown accustomed to that fact
  he boxed the cards put out the
hanging lamp above the table and
walked over to the bar alone for a
drink the red rooster was as good
a place as any to work he thought as
he picked up the glass but after hed
been here a few months hed probably
wander on to a job at another town
somewhere always taking with him
the agility of his lean supple fin-
western
gers and the luck that never failed
him as far as cards were concerned
they were the instruments of his
trade
  leaning casually against the pol-
ished bar he drank his whiskey slow-
ly tasting it one drink after every
session-that was all he allowed him-
self silent moments dragged by
there was the drone of a fly and the
sounds in the street outside where a
hot afternoon sun spilled its heat
 presently the door of spade
pierces office opened and kelsey
came out again
the rancher stopped just with-
in the threshold stood there star-
ing at the room the handful of men
in the saloon didnt look at him after
a moment he came on shuffling feet to
to the cherrywood bar and ordered a
drink his voice was hoarse he
stared blankly at his own expression
in the bar mirror while the liquor was
poured and threw the drink into his
mouth with a hand that trembled
  after that he turned and faced lew
hatton the rasp of his breathing was
audible in the room as he tried with-
out success to check his anger all
right you he gritted blue eyes
blazing out of his homely brick-red
face so its done i know how youve
helped spade pierce to rob me you
dirty thieving-
  setting down his own glass the
gambler straightened and looked at
him coldly his eyes still hadnt
changed expression but the voice
that cut through kelseys words had a
sharp edge to it
  hold on he snapped i dont
take that kind of talk from anyone
  youll take it from me-because
its true my luck couldnt have been
that bad not for two weeks straight
i should have won part of the time-
and i would have if you hadnt
stripped the decks and played out of
your sleeve every damn chance
you-
  thats a lie hatton charged
  kelsey went light on hotly build-
ing into a weak rage you led me on
you milked me clean for pierce day
after day-
a tinhorn chooses hot lead

  you led yourself on the gambler
amended i work here-its nothing
to me who i play with i have to make
a game for anybody who wants one
but you kept coming back and every
time you got wilder you beat your-
self
  the ranchers face had paled a lit-
tle and his mouth twisted harshly
try to talk out of it-go ahead
why you filthy tinhorn-
  hatton saw it coming a moment in
advance lashed by his own words
kelsey suddenly bit them off and was
falling back into a crouch his right
hand shot downward came up palm-
ing the rubber butt of a heavy sixgun
  lew hatton couldnt do anything
else in the face of that but defend
himself seconds after the other start-
ed his draw his own hand was mov-
ing-up toward the breast of his coat
sliding in easily toward his armpit
fingers closing around the hideout
he drew the lean hand out easily
gracefully the two weapons coughed
their bullets forth almost at one time
  but as burnt powder and silence
pressed in again on the tail of the
shots kelsey stumbled he caught
himself with one hand gripping the
edge of the bar hard astonishment
and pain washed across his homely
features the gun slipped from his
fingers with a thud against the floor
and he reached up to claw at his chest
as though he would try to dig out the
bullet that was killing him
  then he collapsed dropping in a
lifeless heap at the foot of the bar
 looking down at him hatton
frowned he hadnt wanted this he
had killed before and always it
seemed in some futile manner there
was no reason why kelsey should
have died but the rancher had forced
him to it
  hatton looked around at the men
in the silent room he saw spade
pierce who had come to the door of
his office at the shooting as he
looked at the paunchy figure of the
saloon man and the evil that lived in
his narrow eyes the beginning of dis-
gust tugged at the gamblers mouth
  then there was a great deal of con-
fusion town marshal ed lane came
hurrying in-a small spare gent in his
fifties with thining hair and level
eyes that seemed to look right through
you lips pursed at sight of the dead
man on the floor he set briskly to
work he took a look at hattons gun
and shot out a rapid fire of questions
about the shooting everyone who had
seen it told him that the gambler had
been forced into his part
after a bit the coroner came in
and took the body away and
presently hatton found himself alone
with the marshal in lanes cubbyhole
of an office eyeing the back of the
little man as the latter stood gazing
silently out the door pipe smoke curl-
ing above his thinning hair shadows
were long and sharp in the late sun-
light outside
  a bad business said the marshal
at last with a sigh id close that red
rooster in two minutes if i could
he turned cocked a challenging eye
upward at the gambler yeah he
added you can tell pierce i said so
too
  his words irritated hatton dont
look at me he retorted im new to
this town and i dont figure to take
sides in its battles i draw my pay
and thats all i care about
 lane puffed a cloud of smoke
shrugged okay he said but tom
kelsey was a good man-hotheaded
and unreasonable at times maybe but
thats little enough against him its
made me pretty sick to watch him go-
in back and goin back to that clip
joint and losin his shirt every
time-
  the games i deal are square hat-
ton told him levelly
 well maybe so but what of it
that cant make much difference now
to kelsey-or his womanfolks
  hatton looked at the other sharply
what women he demanded
  he had a wife and a girl-both as
fine a pair of ladies as i ever knew
they had this little rafter k spread
down on somers creek and they was
a mighty happy family-until the red
rooster got its claws into tom
  the marshal glanced into the street
again suddenly pointed with his pipe
stem you can take a look for your-
self he exclaimed somebodys
been and told them whats happened
and theyre cornin in now take a

-gun western
look and see what your cards and bul-
lets have done
  reluctantly lew hatton went to
the door and stood there watching as
a buckboard and team tooled into the
thick dust of banvilles main street
the younger woman held the reins
her mother sat beside her head bowed
in crushing grief looking at the dark
face of the gambler ed lane thought
for a moment he saw a shadow there-
a hint of self-disgust or regret for ir-
revocable wrong done
  i didnt know hatton said slow-
ly i didnt know about them-
  the marshal only grunted but he
put a lot of meaning into it
  riding beside the buckboard was
the man who had gone out to tell kel-
seys widow and daughter the news
he happened to glance in the direc-
tion of the marshals office now as
they rode abreast of it and caught
sight of hatton standing in the door
at once he leaned and spoke to the
women in the buckboard and both
lifted their heads and stared at the
gambler
  there was loathing in their eyes
and hatton his face like stone met
their glances squarely bearing the
brunt of their scorn he was familiar
with the painted girls of saloon and
honkytonk he was not prepared for
the loveliness he saw now as the face
of tom kelseys daughter was turned
to him somehow it tightened his
throat for an instant
  and then the buckboard had passed
on down the rutted street leaving
hatton staring after it from the door-
way behind him the marshal asked
quietly sort of proud of your pro-
fession right now hatton
  the gambler jerked around in sud-
den anger that killing wasnt my
fault he retorted hotly kelsey
picked the fight didnt he
  lane said nothing only looked at
hatton as he dragged another puff of
smoke out of his pipe but the gam-
bler knew suddenly as well as though
it had been put in words what the
other was thinking
his face darkened with resent-
ment all right say it he grit-
ted cards and liquor and gunplay-i
stand for those things and it was
those things that ruined tom kelsey
and finally killed him thats what
you mean isnt it
  the marshal calmly tamped out his
pipe you said it pretty well he
muttered an i reckon the kelseys
see it the same way he stuffed the
briar in the pocket of his coat well
remember this hatton honest cards
or not-if i ever get the chance to
buck spade pierce and close out that
damn red rooster place of his ill
close you out with it
  hot with rage lew hatton turned
his back and strode out of the mar-
shals office lane had struck very
close with those few terse words the
pride of a gambler and his anger at
being looked on as a pariah were sud-
denly very high and strong in him
 but what the lawman had said
troubled him too the more he let his
thoughts work on it and there was
something else two women in a
buckboard looking crushed and alone
as they drove through banvilles
dusty street a face young and
proud and sadly beautiful 
  he passed the saloon owner spade
pierce almost without seeing him
but then without knowing exactly
why he did it he turned on his heel
and came back a step along the plank
sidewalk stopping the fat man
  just a second pierce he said i
want to talk to you
  the narrow eyes bored into his the
cigar wheeled as the other said
yeah
  about the notes kelsey signed for
you now that hes dead i suppose
youre going to go easy on those
arent you
  pierce studied him coldly whats
it to you he demanded
  hatton was asking the same ques-
tion of himself he said nothing i
reckon but i was just thinking of his
widow-
  and the gal huh there was al-
most an evil sort of humor lurking far
back in the saloon mans piggish eyes
as he said that he took the soggy butt
of the cigar out of his mouth spat on
the sidewalk well he said sur-
prisingly you can forget about the
notes ive torn em up already
hatton hadnt expected that hed
thought it might take some persuad-
a tinhorn chooses hot lead

ing now he blinked a little nodded
good he said im glad you saw it
that way 
  but he was not quite convinced for
there was something in pierces man-
ner that didnt set right
  however that seemed to close the
episode of kelseys death hatton
went back to his work at the saloon
and no one detected any change in
him he was perhaps even more close
mouthed and unreadable than before
but that in itself wasnt strange
  the front he gave to the world hid
much and if he suddenly began to
find less pleasure in the whisper of
the cards in the clink of chips on
baize-covered tables he did not show
it if in the deep of the night he sat
on the edge of his cot in the hotel
smoking and staring at nothing no
one knew for he hardly understood
with any clearness himself just what
was happening to him
  it was with strangely mingled feel-
ings of dread and anticipation that on
the day of the funeral hatton found
himself in the group that went to
stand at the grave of the man hed
killed
  he knew he wasnt wanted there
he felt the weight of the hostile
glances that ranchers and their wives
threw at him as he stood apart from
the rest gaunt and sombre in his dark
gamblers clothes mouth hardening a
little he ignored them he knew sud-
denly that he was waiting for only
one thing and when it came his heart
leaped and swelled within him until
he thought it would pound a hole in
his chest
  one arm around her mother the
girl came walking across the clipped
grass of the crude burial lot hatton
had learned her name-mary a very
ordinary name but somehow filled
with the honest simplicity that was
the girl herself she had real strength
in her hatton knew at once that his
first brief glance had not lied to him
and looking at her he told himself
bitterly that he was a fool
through the brief services he
watched her quietly drinking in
the sight of her then the pine box
coffin had been laid away and the
first clods of earth dropped in upon
it the little group dispersed the
girl was among the last to leave and
hatton stood at a distance watching
her as she remained arranging the
flowers she had brought
  hat in hand he walked over to her
she glanced and saw him coming and
at once he saw the stiffening of her
body coldly she rose to face him
and not far away her mother had
turned and was staring at him too
  miss kelsey he began i-just
wanted to tell you how sorry-
  he faltered and stopped there was
a bitterness and a wall between them
against which his poor words could
not prevail
  the girl said only very well
hatton fumbled in his pocket and
brought out a battered wallet he
looked down at the cracked bulging
bulk of it and then at mary kelsey
i would like to do something he
told her i was going to offer money
to you and your mother but-i sup-
pose you wouldnt take it-
  you are quite right we wouldnt
she answered shortly and if that
is all you have to say-
  the same resentment marshal lane
had roused began to stir in him again
youre not being fair miss kelsey
he protested i didnt want to do-
what i did the other day it was
forced on me i couldnt stand there
and let your father plug me could i
  you should have the loathing
was in her gray eyes her breast rose
and fell under the black of her mourn-
ing dress the mother came a pace
or two nearer uncertainly you
should have died not him the mon-
ey he lost to you was the thing that
put him in a mood for killing you
goaded him on-and he was the one
to die
  dark thunder swept uncontrollably
into hattons face at that i see
he exclaimed  plolier than thou is
that it miss kelsey im not proud
of the work i do but just because i
make my living out of cards instead
of breaking my back in the dirt ill be
damned if i-
  he caught himself suddenly and
instantly his mounting temper cooled
he had forgotten where he was had
forgotten the silence of the burial lot
and the newly covered grave at their

-gun western
feet this girl whose scorn-filled
eyes and biting words had lashed his
anger was the daughter of the man
who had just been laid there for his
final rest the man whom he had
killed
  contrition filled him forgive
me he pleaded humbly i didnt
mean-im sorry
  she tried to control her voice but
emotion put a trembling in it are
you finished she asked tensely
quiet i think youve done quite
enough mr hatton youve taken
away my father and our home-
  his head jerked up as he stared at
her your home he echoed i dont
understand
  i suppose you didnt know that
spade pierce made my father deed
over the rafter k to him
  that staggered hatton no he
exclaimed i swear it
  she said i think he made it con-
tingent upon payment of the money
my father owed him but now-fa-
ther is dead and pierce has the deed
and- i hope youre pleased with eve-
rything youve done
  suddenly she couldnt bear to talk
to him any longer she turned and
walked away small shoulders back
head proudly erect as she took her
mothers arm hatton was left star-
ing after them
his resentment at the girl
had been swept away by the news
she had just given him dragging on
his hat he stood there thinking over
this new angle and slowly his jaw
muscles began to harden into knots
  so pierce had lied he remembered
how smoothly the saloon man had
told him about tearing up kelseys
notes hatton was just the tool hed
used to satisfy his greed
  inwardly seething but with the old
deadly calm showing in his face hat-
ton started down the hill toward the
sunbaked boxes that were the houses
of banville
  when he reached the saloon he
strode on back and looked in pierces
office the fat man wasnt behind his
desk hatton slammed the door and
went over to the bar wheres
pierce
  i dunno the barkeep told him
he went out awhile ago took stew
bardon and one or two of the other
boys with him
  hatton stopped outside the bat-
wings looking up and down the sun-
smitten road as he built a cigarette
and lighted it then he went over to
the livery barn and rented a bronc
  he was a good horseman although
he seldom rode leaving the town be-
hind him he struck out across lush
grazing land browning now under the
hot summer sun and sought the wood-
ed foothills where pierces wigwam
outfit was located but he never got
as far as the ranch for as he came out
on a spur he looked down over the
burning plain and saw three riders
jogging away from there
  at this distance through the heat
haze and dust of the valley floor he
couldnt see the trio clearly but he
didnt have to be told who they were
pierce and his gunslinger bardon
and another and they were heading
in the direction of the flashing bright-
ness which was somers creek
  face grim hatton ticked his
mounts ribs with spur steel and set
it on a course down through the hills
the leisurely gait pierce and the
others were taking indicated they
were very confident and sure of
themselves it also gave hatton time
to beat them to the goal if he hurried
and that was what he did using the
spurs he cut a circle around them and
then struck out in a rolling gallop he
had left them far behind when som-
ers creek showed ahead and the tiny
buildings that were the rafter k
  hatton dropped from a saddle into
a cloud of dust and waded through it
toward the front door of the little
house it was a neat place with a tiny
porch and curtains at the windows
and vines climbing up the wbite wall
the door opened as hatton came up
and mary kelsey faced him
  she had a rifle in her hands and be-
yond her hatton caught a glimpse of
her mother face white with grief and
with fear at the sight of him he
needed nothing more to tell him that
these women were alone here and
that there would be no one to help
them when pierce came
  but the gun made him hesitate the
a tinhorn chooses hot lead

girl said all right you dont need
to come any closer
  he shook his head you wont lis-
ten to me he told her so ill not
try to talk but take a look back there
along the trail
  she followed his pointing finger
and caught her breath sharply at what
she saw spade pierce she ex-
claimed
  yes hes coming to take over-or
try it
 her eyes blazed and her small
hands tightened on the rifle stock
just let him she said tightly
  hatton heard the gasp that the old
woman gave at that he said rather
harshly dont be silly youre all
alone one woman against the three
of them and i think your mother
looks as though she were going to
faint
  the girl turned then to glance at
her alarmed she freed one hand to
put it on her mothers shoulder and
it was a simple matter for hatton to
step to the door and pick the heavy
rifle out of her other hand
mary kelsey tried to take it
back but he took her arm gently
and forced her into the living room of
the little house please he begged
look after your mother i know you
hate me but let me try and handle
this for you
 before she could answer he was
outside again closing the door behind
him the last glimpse he had of her
showed her gray eyes baffled and an-
gry and yet with a new uncertainty
creeping into them as she stared after
him
  lew hatton didnt like a rifle so
he leaned this one beside the door and
felt instead for the light revolver in
its clip holster under his arm it was
there and ready so he went to the
front of the little porch and leaned
casually against a post with the vines
dripping about his head and waited
for pierce
  the fat man was in the center on
a jug headed roan with squint-eyed
stew bardon at his right and another
gunslinger on the other side they
drew rein before the house and stayed
in the saddle while they eyed the
lone man who guarded the door
  spade pierce looked suspicious and
puzzled morning hatton he said
cautiously i didnt figure to find
you here
 dont reckon you did hatton
still stood at ease one shoulder
against the post his face was blank
unreadable
  social call the saloon man asked
feeling him out
 the gamblers reply was a slow
shake of the head he didnt once take
his glance from the eyes of the other
and pierce began to grow nervous
  well the saloon man said were
here on business ourselves if youll
excuse us we want to talk to the
ladies-
  im settling this affair for them
hatton answered he straightened
and was suddenly wary intent his
voice cracked out take that phony
deed and turn around and get the hell
out of here spade that goes for
your hired killers too
  pierce tauted oh you know about
it eh he snarled well this
deed-
  -was bought with gambling debts
-which arent and never have been
legal hatton finished im not let-
ting you collect on it and i reckon
you know marshal lane wouldnt
have anything to do with it either
  he thought spade pierce was going
to explode then he saw the two gun-
men watching their boss waiting for
instructions
 damn you hatton the saloon
man shouted keep your nose out of
other peoples business get out of
that doorway and-
  i dont know but what i ought to
kill you pierce said hatton quiet-
ly i killed tom kelsey and he
didnt deserve it any more than you
do he wouldnt have crowded a
mans widow and daughter this way
on the very day of the funeral he
wouldnt have been such a damn
skunk
 with a screech of rage spade
pierce suddenly dug for a gun he
was fast-faster than hatton could
have dreamed the gamblers weapon
was barely out of its clip holster when
the first bullet crashed into him
that bullet was meant for his heart
instead it hit the gunarm that was

-gun western
doubled across his chest and broke
it the hideout gun dropped from
hattons numbed fingers and struck
the floor of the porch and the gam-
bler in the fierce grip of pain
dropped after it
  he heard pierces shout of tri-
umph as from a great distance and
knew the saloon man thought that
slug had killed him fire raged
through his shattered arm gnawed
into his brain
hatton forced himself up
looked and saw the gun hed
dropped lying inches away he
groped for it with his left hand stew
bardon yelled at his boss as he saw
that the man was still alive
  next moment a snarling hell of lead
rained down on the neat painted floor
of the porch hatton hoped vaguely
none of those flying slugs would go
through the door into the house
where the girl and her mother were
he got the gun into his fingers as
the hot hand of lead touched him in a
couple of places
  then he was answering the fire of
the three killers left-handed stew
bardon screamed and dropped from
saddle
  spade pierce and the other man
were fighting their lunging horses
that had been frightened to a panic
by the racket of the gunfire hatton
knew that only that fact had saved
him from their bullets carefully he
propped his elbow against the floor
beneath him and drew a line on the
saloon mans bulky frame
  acrid smoke bit into his eyes with
the tug of the trigger
son of a gun
  i-ie barely heard the report a gray
fog was coming down on him
through it he saw dimly two horses
galloping away dwindling against the
horizon there was a man on the back
of one crouched low over the neck
of the pony as though mortally afraid
of bullets from the rear but the sad-
dle of spade pierces jug headed roan
was empty
  a bulky figure lay still in the dirt
in front of the house
  fog settled in again it was cool-
cool and soft like a hand but maybe
it really was a hand he felt
  he heard himself saying the
deed-get it from his pocket tear it
up its worthless
  another voice was sobbing some-
thing like dont die please dont
die
  youre being silly mary that
he thought must be tom kelseys
widow speaking he wont die she
said hes only shot up a little
  and hatton told himself that she
had to be right for mary kelsey and
her mother would need help on the
rafter k now that tom was gone
  he knew for sure only that if he
lived cards and gambling would be a
thing of the past with him it war
better to sweat and toil in the clean
earth and be free of men like spade
pierce and the red rooster with its
smoke and stench
  he knew too that the loathing
would be missing from the girls gray
eyes after this to hatton lying half
in the shadow of oblivion it was not
necessary to ask for more

one of the favorite dishes of the old-time western cowboy was a stew
called all sorts of names but the mildest of them all was son of a gun
everything went into it except the hide horns and hoofs of the animal in
question this always incidentally came from the other fellers herd as
no cowman liked the taste of his own beef
  to rustle it up you cooked the toughest ingredients first-such as the
heart which was cut into tiny cubes and the tongue which was skinned
before it was cubed then pieces of tenderloin and sweetbreads and liver
these last were used sparingly to avoid bitterness
  next you had an argument if there were other cooks around as to
whether or not the marrow gut should be added for even though this is
only the tube connecting the two stomachs of cut-chewing creatures opin-
ions on its value to the stew were always varied and sometimes violent if

on the ground then with a rifle
shoved out before him and a mans
white face notched neatly in the
center of his sights his finger was
tightening on the trigger when big
rawboned easy-going rod donnelly
whod been packing a gun of one sort
or another ever since hed been a kid
found out that he didnt have what it
took to kill a man
  not that there was any lack of prov-

his finger was tightening on the trigger when rod
donnelly whod been packing a gun ever since he was
a kid found out that he didnt have what it took to
kill a man


-gun western
saddle like a jockey had swung their
mounts across a flat filled with new
snow they had covered forty miles
since daybreak the better part of it in
silence alec brendle was a scotsman
frugal even with his words and don-
nelly had picked up something of the
old mans habit but as they turned
their horses up slope toward the trees
donnelly put his head back and saw
their cabin just ahead beyond the
cabin still hidden by the trees was
the prospect shaft they had gouged
out of the rocky slope-the mine that
was to make them rich
  shes still there alec the young-
er man said cheerfully
  aye said alec brendle
  it was the last word he ever spoke
the bullet hit the little scotsman in
the chest it knocked him backward
and out of saddle as his frightened
horse plunged aside donnelly heard
the blasting roar of the shot the twin
echoes of the two shots following he
felt the tug of the bullet that touched
a sleeve of his bearskin coat his horse
was rearing frantically when hidden
rifles on the hillside slope crashed in
a second shattering volley
  the shelter of the trees and safety
was no more than twenty feet away
but there was little alec brendle on
the ground deftly the big puncher
slipped his carbine from the saddle
boot unhesitatingly he quit the
plunging horse to kneel beside the
fallen man with bullets whining
overhead he turned alec brendle on
his back he looked at brendles face
and saw that the little scotsman was
beyond the need of help lead burned
a path of fire across his ribs as he
threw himself toward the trees a bul-
let cut his feet out under him and sent
him pitching forward in a headlong
dive
  he landed on hands and knees and
still clutching the short rifle grimly
he crawled toward a snow-covered
pinyon log back braced against the
log safe for the moment donnelly
checked up on the damage done one
bullet had grazed his ribs quite harm-
lessly a second had struck him in the
leg just above the ankle it was this
second wound which made donnelly
frown already his boot was filling
up with blood
  he lifted his head for a hasty glance
over that snow-covered slope but saw
no sign of the killers he knew were
concealed somewhere above in rocks
and trees calmly dispassionately he
considered the situation old alec
brendle dead killed by a cowardly
bullet out of ambush an unknown
number of killers between himself and
the cabin in an empty desolate land
winter-locked with the nearest ranch-
house almost twenty miles away he
was afoot and wounded and out-
numbered by a murder pack what
motive might lie behind the treach-
erous attack he did not know it would
be something about the mine he
thought if he pulled out alive there
would be time to consider motive
later
  flat on his side behind the log he
removed the blood-filled boot awk-
wardly but efficiently he bandaged
the ankle tightly with strips of cloth
torn from his undershirt that done
he set out to locate the men above him
having lost his hat in his hasty dive
for shelter he was forced to use his
coat as a decoy it was a good coat a
bearskin coat cut hip length for a man
who spent time in the saddle don-
nelly had killed the bear he had
tanned the hide himself and had the
garment tailored to his own particular
specifications
  draping the bearskin coat over the
barrel of his rifle carefully the
wounded man hoisted it above the
level of the log on the hillside a rifle
crack donnelly lowered the decoy
  one he said
 he worked patiently crawling
through the snow sliding the fur coat
along the snow-covered log by the
time he reached the end of the log
he had drawn half a dozen shots and
had a fair picture of the problem
ahead of him three men on that hill-
side slope he guessed two hidden
behind rocks close together the third
in trees and brush some fifty feet
farther up the slope already this
third man was working around the
hillside to cut behind him
  there was no pain in the wounded
leg yet but the blood in his boot was
uncomfortable and he was dragging a
crimson trail behind him through the
snow the situation seemed to call
through gunsights

for a flanking maneuver and with
this in mind he turned his back on
those men above him like a wounded
animal slipping away from the hunt-
ers gun he crawled through tunnels
between snow-laden clumps of brush
using each bit of cover each slight
depression on the hillside slope to aid
him on his way he got away without
a shot being fired two hundred
yards and he was deep in brush and
trees and he pulled himself erect then
and tried his weight on the bullet-
torn leg and gasped at the sudden
stabbing pain that ran through his
body knowing then that the bullet
had shattered a bone donnellys lips
tightened in a twisted grin
  nice he muttered very nice
indeed
with no knowledge of when the
first of that killer pack might
break through the trees calmly he
took time out to make a pair of
crutches they were nothing fancy
they were two cedar branches hacked
off with a pocketknife with limb
crotches to serve as arm rests but
donnelly tried them in a few hobbling
steps and found they would suffice
he went on awkwardly slipping and
sliding on the frozen slope stumbling
falling climbing to his feet again but
always working deeper into the trees
as he pushed steadily up the slope
  how long it took to reach the top
of the ridge rod donnelly didnt
know on crutches it was a heart-
breaking chore but reach the top he
did and once across the ridge abrupt-
ly he changed directions pointing up
canyon in a course which would lead
him to the cabin for the moment he
had slipped away from his attackers
how long his luck would hold he
didnt know in this game of life and
death he was terribly handicapped
but he had also one slight advantage
he knew each foot of this lonely
country as a man might know his own
back yard
  two hundred yards up canyon he
cut back toward the top of the ridge
discarding the crutches temporarily
he crawled through snow on hands
and knees shoving the rifle before
him atop the ridge he lay flat sweep-
ing the wintry waste below in slow
and careful inspection
  he located one man first and then
another they were far below mere
blurs of color against a white back-
ground moving cautiously from tree
to tree as they sought to locate the
man who had slipped away from them
if there was a third one in the party
rod donnelly could not find him al-
though he gave ten minutes to the ef-
fort
 hes gone ahead he decided
hes worked around the point
  having placed the missing member
of the murder pack to his own satis-
faction donnelly faced another prob-
lem both men below were within
rifle range but as a shot would be a
gamble and with his crippled leg the
cowpuncher didnt feel like trying to
slip closer to the pair and a shot now
would reveal his position undo all the
advantage gained by the heart-break-
ing effort on the crutches he was not
very far from the cabin  
 the sound of a snapping stick
jerked donnelly around froze him
into sudden rigidity there on the
frozen ground off to his left and
below him a man had come suddenly
into view from behind a snow-
blanketed clump of brush a man who
must have been resting there through
all the time that donnelly had
tried to locate him in corduroys and
heavy sheepskin coat with a rifle
swinging in his hand he was pushing
his way slowly up the slope he was
so close that donnelly could hear the
crusted snow crunching beneath his
boots
  and donnellys lips moved sound-
lessly galt he said dave galt
  dave galt he knew quite well galt
owned a little one-cow spread beyond
the mountain also he owned a pack
of hunting dogs and in spare time
galt had built a rep hunting mountain
lions more than once on the trail of
a big cat he had stayed overnight at
the cabin with donnelly and little
alec brendle that now galt should
reveal himself as one of the men who
had ambushed little alec and himself
was for an instant unbelievable to big
rod donnelly and then suddenly it
was not surprising at au he could re-
member nights when that dark and
sullen man had sat around the cabin
asking questions about the mine the

-gun western
while his beady eyes moved restlessly
missing nothing
  dave galt had reached the top of
the ridge he went down on hands
and knees he crawled forward push-
ing the rifle ahead of him scanning
the snow-filled canyon below with
alert and wary eyes quite evidently
he had guessed that donnelly might
double back up-trail he wasnt fifty
yards from donnelly but donnelly
was beyond him on the ridge and
galts attention was directed the oth-
er way
  and slowly carefully donnelly
worked the thirty-thirty carbine
around and laid the barrel across a
snow-crusted rock he knew this man
he dealt with even before todays
events hed known that dave galt
was a dangerous man galt was
sprawled flat now head and shoulders
up his body hidden by brush don-
nelly could see his tight fitting fur
cap the collar of the sheepskin coat
he drew a careful bead his finger
closing down on the trigger he hesi-
tated
  and then as though warned by
some subtle sixth sense dave galt
turned his head slowly and looked
straight into donnellys eyes
  it was a queer thing there was
this moment when these two men
looked at one another across fifty
yards of space- dave galt caught
off guard helpless looking down a
bright and shining barrel into the
eyes of a man hed planned to kill-
rod donnelly squinting through
gun-sights at one of the murder pack
who had done for alec brendle his
finger tightening on the trigger for
the shot that would send a bullet
crashing through dave galts head
and nothing happened it was
queer even to donnelly he
couldnt pull the trigger he
couldnt add that ultimate ounce of
pressure which would smash a thirty-
thirty bullet between galts staring
eyes it wasnt sympathy compassion
doubt in donnellys mind was no
question but that galt was the man
responsible for alec brendles death
it was something fundamental some-
thing buried deep in donnelly him-
self he wasnt a killer it seemed he
couldnt kill a man
  and the big punchers finger was
still tugging at the trigger and he
was still staring at galt through rifle
sights when suddenly the other man
broke the spell dave galt spun like a
big cat in the snow to fling himself
behind a pile of snow-covered rocks
hardly had he disappeared when his
rifle crashed one shot and another
and another the bullets kicking up
puffs of snow around rod donnellys
head
  donnelly had ducked back auto-
matically he lay sprawled in the
snow thinking of that priceless
chance he had let slip through his
fingers-the chance to pay off one of
alec brendles killers with hot lead
he said disgustedly im damned
buck fever
  pain from the bullet-shattered leg
throbbed through his body face
down in snow he cursed the chicken-
hearted softness which had caused
him to spare galts life knowing quite
well that he might pay dearly for that
instant of weakness before this game
was over granted a similar chance
there would be no hesitation on the
part of galt or of that pair who
travelled with him old alec dead on
a snow-filled flat below offered mute
testimony on that point
  it was too late for regrets galt had
ducked from sight galt was on one
side of the ridge now donnelly on the
other the puncher twisted in the
snow gun held on the spot where galt
had disappeared he gained a glimpse
of galts fur cap above a rock he trig-
gered a hasty shot and the cap pulled
out of sight he knew that galt had
held it up to draw his fire a second
later galt fired twice the slugs whin-
ing harmlessly overhead
  then it was that donnelly got an-
other shock he had known that his
leg was bleeding but he was not pre-
pared for the widening crimson circle
in the snow where his foot had rested
that much blood meant that the bullet
must have severed an artery in his leg
already he had lost more blood than
he could conveniently spare
  he threw a shot down slope in
galts direction not bothering to aim
then swiftly he went to work on the
ankle with his bandanna handker-
chief he rigged a tourniquet above
through gunsights

the blood-soaked bandage twisting it
tight and tighter with a stick setting
his jaw against the pain that rolled
over him as he lashed the stick itself
against his leg it was done at last
and then slowly cautiously crawling
from bush to rock from rock to snow-
covered bush he worked his way back
along the ridge away from galt and
toward the cabin
  knowing each foot of this country
he knew exactly the point at which
having left galt behind on the thick-
ly-wooded hillside he had to cross the
ridge to drop down on the cabin from
the rear he persevered grimly push-
ing his rifle ahead and dragging his
useless leg behind dropping down
slope with agonizing slowness toward
the cabin the crutches he had aban-
doned
  there was a small space of level
ground at the bottom of the slope he
managed it on hands and knees ex-
pecting each instant to hear the blast-
ing roar of guns from the hillside
nothing happened he pulled up in
the shadow of the cabin wall without
event the cabin had one door in
front there was a window at the
back on hinges and fortunately un-
locked he shoved the window open
hoisted his body over the sill crawled
inside the cabin
  inside he managed to get his one
good leg under him and pulled himself
erect he hopped through to the
kitchen there was a fire in the range
and on the oilcloth-covered table were
dirty dishes which had not been there
when he and alec had left the cabin
two days before outside the kitchen
window he could see a path already
well-broken through the new snow
leading to the tar-paper shack which
had served alec and himself as com-
bination stable and blacksmith shop
that galt and his men had spent time
here was evident but now donnelly
could see no sign of any of them about
the place
on a corner of the kitchen
table donnelly assembled a miscel-
lany of instruments and material a
colt sixgun a pocket-knife a quart
bottle of whiskey a package of absorb-
ent cotton and strips of white cloth
for bandages aware that he might be
interrupted any moment he lost no
time already the tourniquet on his
leg was biting into flesh he set his
jaw and hooked it up another notch
he cut the blood-soaked bandage
from his ankle and soaked the leg
liberally with whiskey the bullet
had gone through neatly in and out
in the wound he rammed plugs of
absorbent cotton soaked in whiskey
closing his teeth against the pain and
pushing the plugs solidly into place
with a match stick he sloshed more
whiskey on the leg wrapped it
tightly with layer after layer of ban-
dage that done he removed the tour-
niquet and wrapped leg and foot in
wide strips torn from a blanket it was
makeshift medicine the best he could
manage under the circumstances
  he was finished barely in time he
had just finished tying the blanket-
bandage in place when he lifted his
head to see men and horses coming up
the trail toward the cabin three men
with two saddled horses and then
donnelly saw that galt and his crew
had caught up old alecs horse and
his own their thought was plain
enough in this lonely wasteland a
wounded man on foot would be in des-
perate plight
  the three men came on carelesslv
dave galt in front and behind galt
two men leading the captured horses
donnelly recognized them both the
tall one was pete duchelle the short-
er one clint abad both worked for
dave galts k bar outfit beyond the
mountain knowing them onlv slight-
ly donnelly knew them well enough
to know that both were tough hands
  he reached for his rifle resting
against the table by the time he got
the gun the men with the horses had
turned aside toward the stable and
galt was coming up the trail alone he
came on striding carelessly a big
hook-nosed man in levis and sheen-
skin coat sixgun in hand rod don-
nelly worked his way along the wall
to stand quietly just inside the cabin
door
 the door shoved open galt was
coming through the doorway when
donnelly stabbed him with the colt
  lift em galt he snapped
  for the space of a single heartbeat
big hook-nosed dave galt stared at
-gun western
him in stunned surprise then he
moved like a striking snake one hand
pawed out in a lightning thrust to
knock the gun aside galts body
twisted and his big shoulders pinned
donnelly back against the wall one
hand found donnellys throat with
the other galt was grabbing for the
sixgun when rod donnelly shoved
clear of the wall and smashed the bar-
rell of the gun against galts head
  that single stunning blow checked
the fury of galts attack drove the
hook-nosed man back on his heels
with only one good leg under him
donnelly grabbed galt around the
neck he held with one hand while he
brought the sixgun crashing down on
galts head in a terrific blow that sent
galt toppling backward through the
open cabin door donnelly sprawled
on top of him
  dave galt was spread-eagled in the
snow unconscious donnelly pushed
to his knees and a gun roared and the
big puncher looked up to see pete
duchelle rifle in his hand taking
careful aim for a second shot from the
door of the blacksmith shop he threw
himself aside as the gun exploded
and he heard the bullet thud into log
walls at his back with his sixgun he
threw two shots at duchelle and drove
the man back inside the blacksmith
shop grabbing dave galt by the col-
lar he dragged the hook-nosed man
inside the cabin
  there watching meanwhile through
the window he bound galt hand and
foot
  dave galt rolled over for an in-
stant the beady black eyes he fixed on
donnelly were filled with puzzle-
ment donnelly was sprawled on the
floor by the window watching the
blacksmith shop
 for a wounded gent you get
around fast the hook-nosed man
growled suddenly
  he wriggled into a more comfort-
able position i could use a smoke
you could said donnelly he
rolled a cigarette lit it drank in a
lungful of smoke i could use some
information galt what in hell was
your idea killing alec
  galt regarded him unblinkingly
figured the mine was worth it
donnelly stared at him the mines
recorded you couldn t jump it-you
couldnt get away with it if you killed
both of us-
  figgered to kill both of you
stated galt brazenly mebbe though
i wasnt figgering to jump the mine
what was it then
  galts thin lips curled mockingly
roll me a smoke and ill tell you
beyond the cabin from the direc-
tion of the blacksmith shop a gun
roared once and window glass shat-
tered on the floor and the slug crashed
into pans behind the stove donnelly
glanced out casually he rolled a cig-
arette and leaned over to shove it be-
tween the lips of the bound man on
the floor he held a match while galt
puffed contentedly
  tell me he said
  it was a tip i got said galt a
gent in town tipped me off you two
jaspers had banked moren five thou-
sand dollars in the last three months
way i figgered it that meant you and
old alec had hit a pocket of high
grade-it couldnt mean anything else
i knew once the pass snowed in
thered be nobody here until spring
mebbe not then three men can do a
hell of a lot of digging between now
and next spring
  you figured to clean the pocket
out be gone in the spring before we
were missed-before the killings were
discovered-
  dave galt grinned harshly some-
thing like that course after it was
found you two had disappeared after
the excitiment died down a gent
could move in and take the mine with-
out too much trouble
  and donnelly nodded grim under-
standing his first thought had been
that the killing of alec brendle had
been brutally purposeless he saw now
that the crime his own murder as
well had been planned by a cold and
ruthless brain dave galt had guessed
correctly when he guessed that the
two partners had hit upon high-grade
ore and during the long winter
months the three killers could quite
easily have cleaned out that pocket
they could have been gone with the
spring thaws leaving behind no rec-
ord of their crime if later they
cared to come back and file claim to
through gunsights

the mine there would be none to dis-
pute their ownership
  you hit it right galt rod don-
nelly said slowly we found a pock-
et alec and me quartz you can crum-
ble in your fingers rotten with gold
its up there now-and youll never
get it some of it will buy drinks for
san lorenzo the day you hang
  dave galt expelled a thin stream of
blue smoke mebbe he said hardily
i aint on the gallows yet its forty
miles to san lorenzo and you got
two jaspers to wrap up and tag before
you make delivery
  those gents will pull out galt
  galt grinned at him with alec
brendle dead down on the flat he
jeered with them knowing they got
a murder charge to face if you get out
of here alive dont fool yourself
donnelly those gents will camp right
here till your hides nailed on the
wall
  and deep in his heart rod donnel-
ly had no choise but to agree with that
hooked-nose killer on the floor the
odds were two to one against him
more the scales were tipped in anoth-
er way he was crippled he had lost
more blood than he could afford and
he knew in a few hours more or less
that fever would be rushing through
his veins he knew that then he would
be in no shape to deal with those kil-
lers beyond the cabin
  they got the horses galt said
dont reckon youll try to hop to
town on one foot and you got to
sleep sometime this is a finish fight
donnelly and youre still a hell of a
long ways from san lorenzo
  a finish fight a fight he didnt
have much chance of winning don-
nelly could see that now very clearly
stretched out beside the window his
wounded leg on fire he watched
against the chance of a surprise at-
tack by that pair camped in the
blacksmith shop but probably they
wouldnt attack probably they would
be content to wait they could af-
ford to wait in this empty snow-
filled wasteland there was no need
for haste
  you had your chance to kill me
once today said galt suddenly you
had me dead center in rifle sights
why didnt you squeeze trigger
  maybe i was saving you for the
gallows galt
  hell said the hook-nosed man
scornfully you didnt have the guts
to shoot ive known gents like that
before now-gents packing a gun they
were afraid to use it takes nerve to
kill a man donnelly-even a man you
hate mebbe you didnt know that be-
fore today
donnelly looked up you got
that kind of nerve galt
  sure said galt it was my slug
killed alec brendle why should i
lie now you had your chance to
square it and you couldnt pull the
trigger he grinned wickedly meb-
be it was bible stuff thou shalt not
kill eh donnelly mebbe thats why
you held your fire
  maybe said donnelly he crawled
across the kitchen to stoke the
range with clumps of p i n y o n
wood he piled the firebox full then
crawled on to close the door between
kitchen and bedroom and came
back to take his position at the win-
dow pain moved along his leg in
knife-thrusts of agony there was
still no sign of activity from the
blacksmith shop those men could
wait he couldnt he had to bring
this to a boil-had to end it quickly
one way or another
  heat from the blazing stove spread
out and filled the tiny rom dave
galt wriggled in his sheepskin coat
perspiration flowing down his lean
face
  you trying to roast us donnelly
he snarled
  take off the coat said rod
  with my hands tied behind me
  donnelly moved around him ill
untie you long enough to slide out of
the coat he said dont try any-
thing galt maybe i aint got nerve
enough to kill a man but sure as hell
ill knock your skull loose from your
shoulders if you make one funny
move
  he untied galts wrists waited
while the hook-nosed man wriggled
out of the sheepskin coat tied the
wrists again his gun was in galts
back but the other submitted without
protest from the blacksmith shop a
rifle roared and a bullet buried itself
in log walls

-gun western
 time crawled rod donnelly
sprawled by his window thinking
back remembering how his partner-
ship with alec brendle had begun
  suddenly he rolled over shoved
the cabin door wide open a lead slug
sliced slivera from the door jamb he
looked at hook-nosed galt well
be going now he said
  going echoed galt he stared
at donnelly you aiming to crow-
hop to town donnelly
  i got a better way said donnelly
curtly he reached for a strip of the
torn blanket on the floor ill have to
blindfold you
  blindfold me said galt for the
first time a trace of uneasines was
in the tone of the hooked-nosed man
what you figgering to do
  donnellys face was a bleak mask
it will be revealed he said hold
still or ill cave your head in
  tightly he fixed the blindfold
around the bound mans eyes and
suddenly all of dave galts harsh as-
surance was gone there was the be-
ginning of panic in galts voice
  you aiming to use me for a shield
donnelly
  donnelly cut the ropes binding his
legs stand up he said its cold
out-youll want a coat
what you planning donnelly
listen galt im going to untie
your hands now just long enough for
you to crawl into your coat ill have
a gun in your back all the time
  he prodded galt with the six-gun
to let him know that it was there
then body braced against the wall
he held the coat while the blindfolded
man slid his arms reluctantly through
the sleeves he slapped a stetson on
galts head your hats outside
youll have to wear one of mine
galt spoke earnestly pete du-
chelle and clint abad are out there
donnelly both of them jaspers know
how to shoot i dont know what
youre planning-
  curtly donnelly cut him short
shut up i thought you was a
tough hand galt better save your
wind- youll need it ill get my
he saw the tight line of dave galts
lips he knew now that there was a
hat said donnelly
chink in galts armor
he turned awkward on the one
good leg and in that instant
swiftly dave galt made his play
dave galt whose eyes were blind-
folded now but whose hands were
free lifted a hand in lightning move-
ment and jerked the blindfold from
his eyes for a fraction of a second
the big man stood balanced on his
toes rod donnelly was in the act of
reaching for a hat hanging from a
wooden peg in the wall
  in a flash the hook-nosed killer saw
his opportunity just as swiftly he
grasped i his hands were free now
so were his feet the blindfold was
torn from his eyes weaponless he
lashed out savagely at donnellys jaw
with his fist he missed the jaw the
blow struck donnellys shoulder but
it knocked the one-legged man off
balance and sent him spinning to the
floor he landed on his hips gun
lifting too late dave galt was al-
ready at the door donnelly threw a
shot at him but galt was through
the door galt was outside running-
with desperate speed to beat a bullet
at his back
  and then as suddenly aa it had
started it was over dave galt head
down was racing toward the black-
smith shop his whole concern was
to escape a bullet from donnellys gun
and so he was quite unprepared for
what occurred-for the crashing roar
of guns from the blacksmith shop or
for the bullets that met him before he
had covered half a dozen yards they
struck the hook-nosed killer one bul-
let and another they stopped his
head-long rush and propped him up-
right for a moment and then galts
knees caved under him
  rod donnelly had crawled to the
window from the window he watched
the blacksmith shop he saw the door
of the shop swing open saw two men
step outside a tall man and a short
one they trudged across the snow-
covered ground toward the cabin
each man carried a rifle the tall man
said something to the short man both
laughed they came on they had
almost reached that twisted figure in
the snow when donnelly rolled over
into the doorway donnelly edged the
thirty-thirty through the door
  get em up he rasped
 and both men stopped pete du-
through gunsights

chelle and clint abad tough hands
both but now they were two statues
frozen into place then lanky pete
duchelle looked down at the figure in
the snow
  its dave he said stupidly
  the words seemed to break a spell
clint abad flung himself aside trying
desperately to swing his rifle into
line the rifle barked from the cabin
and abad went down his gun unfired
pete duchelle managed to get in one
shot firing his rifle from the hip the
slug kicked up snow a foot in front of
the cabin doorway rod donnelly took
deliberate aim his bullet hit duchelle
in the center of the chest
  rod donnelly watched duchelle go
down he lowered the rifle slowly
not a killer he thought hed been
unable to shoot a little time back
when hed had dave galt helpless un-
der his gun now with two killers
trying to get guns into action hed
had no trouble squeezing trigger it
was hard to understand he let it go
  it wasnt over yet he still had a
long ride ahead of him-twenty miles
to lige altmans ranch on rock creek
sam colts killer
  shortly afterward the father of the
revolver died of his affliction just a
few years earlier he had been arrested
for a  debt upon his death he
left an estate valued at  his
armory was making weapons at the
rate of  per day and also gun-
making machinery for other armories
all over the world he did not live to
hear the death knell of his revolving-
breech rifle nor did he know that a
new invention was about to come
upon the scene which would revolu-
tionize the firearm almost as much as
had his own patent it was the
metallic cartridge
  however the colt armory survived
this new ammunition and after the
first automatic pistols made their ap-
pearance abroad his feature was soon
adapted to colt models too since
then colt has been the main supplier
of this through two world wars and
several local ones but world com-
petition has increased
  of about  revolvers and
automatics made by colt annually in
todays relatively peaceful times
about  per cent are  caliber and
he owed galts crowd something
there theyd caught up the horses for
him and put them in the barn he
was pretty sure he had enough left
to make the ride to altmans
  he crawled outside pete duchelle
was dead in the snow so was dave
galt there was a bloody froth on
clint abads lips but his eyes were
wide open he looked at donnelly
  we figgered  you was dead he
muttered figgered   dave was
in cabin
  donnelly crawled on he picked up
the black stetson hat which had
dropped from dave galts head it
was his best hat his town hat he
rolled dave galt over and patiently
he began to work the dead man out of
the big coat-the black bearskin coat
which had set that hook-nosed killer
up as a target
  when he had finished the task he
glanced again at clint abad abads
eyes were closed now donnelly spoke
softly to a man already dead
  i figured maybe you would abad
he said thats why i let galt wear
my coat and hat	end

the rest are for military police and
sportsmen but the chips are down
there has been an influx of arms from
other countries at lower prices which
colt has difficulty matching because
of cheap labor abroad sam colt
started the game but makers in italy
spain and england and japan may be
stealing the ball
colt was great gun fighter al-
though he never shot a living
thing in his life as far as anyone
knows he gave us a precise system of
mass production which was far ahead
of his time in addition to one of the

by l p holmes
the traveling man wasnt
exactly coherent for which he
could hardly be blamed for
when a man had been first scared half
to death then creased with a  slug
and left for dead and finally woke
up to find himself still in the land
of the living his recollections of what
had happened were bound to be some-
what distorted
  of only one thing was he reason-
ably certain at least two men had
been in on the stage hold-up and
both were masked as sheriff barney
carr pieced the picture together from
the drummers disjointed story the
drummer had been dozing and was
awakened when the stage stopped
abruptly right away there were two
shots and the startled drummer had
stuck his head out the stage door just
as macklin the shotgun guard had
toppled limp and dead into the dust
right under the drummers horrified
eyes after which the drummer had
just time to throw a single glance
along the road and see the two ban-
dits standing there both masked
both with smoking guns one of the
bandits had cursed stabbed his gun
level and the drummers senses had
left him in a great flaming crash
of thunder and shock
  the grizzled old sheriff tried a few
questions in his slow gentle drawl
how had the bandits been dressed
were they big or little men or of
medium size was there any charac-
teristic of any sort by which they
might be marked
  to which the drummer mumbled
 ajj jje jcnew
j time  hohored  was that there
 western o  were two of them
classic copyright  news-
j  bland pub inc
the lynch mob had already gathered
 it was a hell of a country
 where a law-abiding cit-
 izen couldnt ride through
 without getting his brain
 blasted out by a  slug
 but sheriff carr couldnt
 challenge every side-
 winder in town to guns in
 the dust at sunset
that they were masked that they had
tried to kill him and that it was a
hell of a country where a law abiding
citizen couldnt ride through without
getting his brain half battered out by
a  slug
barney carr looked up at doc
oliver and shrugged doc
shrugged back so barney left and
doc walked with him as far as the
door maybe when the shock has
worn off hell remember something
else barney said doc if he does
ill let you know
 barney carr walked slowly back to
his office down street the stage
stood in front of the livery barn the
grizzled old law man had already
looked that over along with the bod-
ies of jim dykes the driver and
shove macklin the shotgun guard so

blood and sweat - or ullets

much for visual evidence now he
had to think
  there would be a lot of bumble-
heads thinking about this too re-
flected barney grimly-and probably
jumping at conclusions like they al-
ways did and the usual criticism
would begin to be whispered about
that barney carr had been a good
sheriff but was getting a little old
for the job now that he spent too
much time sitting around his office
and not enough in the saddle that if
longhorn county had a younger
sheriff with plenty of git-up-and-
git to him this sort of murder and
banditry would not take place that
when next election time rolled around
it might be a good idea if folks
started voting with their heads and
not with their hearts
  barney had heard it all before it
took place every time any sort of a
major crime hit the county and
those who did most of the criticising
neglected entirely to keep track of
the subsequent arrests and convic-
tions which barney reflected with a
grim and sober pride had been well
nigh perfect
  and when they started talking a
younger man for barneys office the
name most often mentioned was that
of ed dow that was all right with
barney for ed was a good boy like
his daddy had been old grizzly dow
afraid of nothing under the sun
strong and rugged ed could ride five
horses into the ground and come up
smiling a better than average hand
with a gun and a good head on him
but a little too chock full of the bust
em wide open spirit of ebullient
youth which led him to jump at con-
clusions a little too readily given
time and the right sort of training
ed would make a right smart law
man
 that was why barney had hired
ed on as deputy though there were
plenty who said at the time that bar-
ney carr had pinned a deputys star
on ed dow to move competition from
the field the fools couldnt they get
it through their thick heads that a
good law man had to be trained same
as for any other profession that was
the trouble in a lot of counties they
elected a backslapper a gent with
swagger and big mouth-and nothing
else then wondered why so much
crime danced loose and free across
the range
  well ed dow was out with a posse
now at the scene of the hold-up try-
ing to pick up a trail and run it down
maybe it would all turn out that sim-
ple once in a while it did though
barney figured this case as being a
little different there were certain
angles about it which needed think-
ing over and barney carr was still
in his office thinking over those an-
gles when ed dow and the posses
came clattering back into prairie
city just at sundown
  ed reported immediately his wide
shouldered dusty figure filling the
doorway as he came in chaps swish-
in spurs clashing
  no luck chief he reported suc-
cinctly there was a trail-two men
we followed it clear back into the
cutbank country they split up there
one going east one west i sent tom
garson and half the posse along one
set of tracks while me and the rest of
the boys followed the other my set
ended up in whit horse creek and
toms ran out in the hardin valley
trail both broncs were bare-foot with
nothing about em to tell off from any
other set of bare foot bronc tracks
all we could go on was the orginal
direction of the getaway trail which
was back into cutbank that set tom
and some of the boys to wondering
about-well they mentioned the
names of buck caspian and milo
studinger
  what do you think kid asked
barney car quietly
pd dow spread his long length in
a chair and built a smoke he
stirred a little restlessly well he
blurted finally-caspian and stud-
inger both got records they both did
time for this same sort of thing-
stage robbery and ive heard my old
dad say that a sheep killin dog never
gets over his taste fur mutton
  barney carr nodded slowly some-
thing in what you say im going to
rustle a bite of supper and ride out
to have a talk with buck and milo
  ill jog along said ed dow 
them two jaspers gone bad again
theyd know right off what you were
riding in for and theyd smoke you
down without giving you a single

-gun western
chance for your alley ill go along to
keep an eye
  no said barney carr youre
staying right here in the office kid
your job will be to keep the fur
smoothed down on the wise ones
theyll be drifting in after supper
to tell you what i should have done
to hand out advice that nobody wants
and that aint worth a damn nohow
and to criticise thats the best thing
they do is criticise you listen and
youll get a couple of ear-fuls but it
all comes under the head of expe-
rience
  it was near midnight when bar-
ney carr got back to prairie city a
light was still going in the office and
when barney went in he found ed
dow waiting for him young ed was
looking a little sullen after one
swift glance at his deputy barney
smiled slightly they must have been
rawhiding you and me pretty heavy
kid lets hear about it
 rawhiding is a mild word
growled ed dow chet shadrow was
in and fit to be tied hed been over at
stone corral setting up a way station
for the projected stage line he aims
to run into baker valley he didnt
know a thing about the hold-up until
he got back to town and then he hit
here raving vinson was down from
the mines and demanding action of
some kind or another for do you
know what them damned holdup
got off the stage they got the mine
payroll thats what they got close on
to twelve thousand dollars vinson
said the mine owners are going to
yell bloody murder and as superin-
tendent hes going to be on the spot
shadrow is howling because this is
going to be a black mark against his
stage line besides losing his best
driver and shotgun guard theyre go-
ing to raise hell and put a rock under
it them two are if we dont get some
kind of results and get em in a hurry
and i dont know as you can blame
em in their place id feel the same
  barney carr got out his old pipe
stuffed it and puffed it aglow
along with all their howling did
they have any suggestions he asked
mildly
  ed dows tone grew a little de-
fiant everybody who was in seemed
to be thinking along the same line
buck caspian and milo studinger
did you see them two
  yep spent the evening with em
theyre like a pair of tickled kids
they been digging a well up on that
dry bald knob range of theirs and
they hit a swell flow of good water
that means they can graze that chunk
of range the year round now instead
of just in the spring they aim to
put in a wind mill and a couple of
concrete water troughs opening up
that bald knob range to year round
grazing means they can put some of
their bottom range into alfalfa
darned smart progressive cattlemen
them two boys
  ed dow got abruptly to his feet
im going to turn in he growled
  sure said barney carr gnight
kid
  ed dow slammed the door behind
him as he went out old barney
smiled grimly think im a simple
minded old fool dont you kid he
murmured well youth has to learn
i reckon
barney spent the balance of the
night on the office bunk and met
ed dow at breakfast in the hash
house ed was still sulky curt and
uncommunicative while they were
eating chet shadrow came in growl-
ing behind his black bristly beard
  wondering when id get a chance
to talk to you carr he snapped
what you aiming to do about that
hold-up
  why try and run down the trail
of course golly the cook sure got
a good brew on the java this morning

  shadrow cursed grabbed barney
carr by the arm and jerked him
around listen here you simple old

drummer nearly got his too the
mine payroll was lifted it is all a
heavy jolt against my stageline i

dent neither does anybody else

order and when i start talking seri-
ous business with you you moon
blood and sweat - or bullets

 over good java well get this
 straight we want some action on
 this thing if you cant get it well

 else who will
    barney carr blinked i aim to get
  some action chet-soon as i know
  where the trail leads
    why dont you try the trail that
  leads out to the circle c s sneered
  shadrow ive heard it said that buck
  caspian and milo studinger have had
  experience at robbing stages in the
  past
   mebbe so murmured barney
 carr but that was in the past id
 say those boys were pretty good citi-
 zens now they been digging a well
 up on their bald knob range and
 
     
    listen growled the irate stage
  owner maybe you were a good sher-
  iff-in the past but this is-now
  and folks are wondering
    folks are always wondering mur-
  mured barney carr thats their
  privilege well-i got to be going
  pour your troubles on ed hes got
  young shoulders and broad ones you
  stick around ed i got some riding
  to do dont know when ill be back
  sheriff barney carr was gone from
  prairie city for two whole days and
  nights and during that time he put
  in a heap of riding he circled almost
  as far out as baker valley came back
  through the cut bank country hit
  the mines on rawhide peak where he
  had a talk with vinson the superin-
  tendent then went back to cut bank
  he hit white horse creek and the
  hardin valley trail riding circle af-
  ter circle his weather-puckered eyes
  full of earth-searching scrutiny and
  remote gathering thought
    he lived off a box of crackers and
  a chunk of cheese he had picked up
  at the store before leaving prairie
  city both nights he slept on the
  ground his saddle for a pillow scanty
  saddle blanket his only covering he
  seemed to grow more lean and leath-
  ery by the hour but in those puck-
  ered old eyes a gleam of triumph was
  growing sharper and sharper and at
  mid-morning of the third day gaunt
  and dusty sheriff barney carr
  jogged back toward prairie city
on his way in he dropped by at
v the circle c s for another little talk
with buck caspian and milo stud-
inger but the only person about the
ranch was a wrinkled old mexican
whom caspian and studinger had
hired as a man of all work about the
place the mexican was squatted on
his heels in front of the ranchhouse
and his black eyes as he looked up to
face the sheriff were sullen and re-
sentful
  howdy pedro hailed barney
carr cheerfully wheres buck and
milo up at the new well
pedro spat deliberately with a
contempt which made barneys
eyes narrow they are in jail said
pedro you should know that senor
carr you-who have posed as their
friend yes-they are in your jail
  barney carr was suddenly very
cool and quiet let me get that right
pedro you say buck and milo are
in jail who arrested them
  your deputy of course who
would have taken them if not you
ed dow arrested them he and a
posse that senor-was black
treachery on your part and i
pedro lopez have little liking of you
for it
  a flash of grim anger showed in
barney carrs eyes then faded to a
cool calculating gleam if i was
responsible for it i wouldnt blame
you for feeling that way pedro he
said but i havent been anywhere
near town for the past two days and
nights and i knew nothing of this
nor did i give the order that it should
be done
  pedro searched the sheriffs face
with a long intent scrutiny then
nodded i am sorry senor he said
gravely you are not at fault but 
would get to town quickly for among
the posse i heard some talk of lynch-
ing
  grab a bronc pedro said bar-
ney carr grimly well ride in to-
gether
  they wasted no time along the
trail but barney carr slowed as they
reached the outskirts of the prairie
city the town was crowded the
single street full of milling riders
and there was a group of miners
there also barney let out a gusty
breath of relief there was a lynch
mob forming all right but it hadnt
reached the point of insensate blind

-gun western
action yet which meant that buck
caspian and milo studinger were
still safe
   stick around pedro said bar-
ney nothing to worry about yet i
got a little chore over at doc olivers
place
  barney slipped around the back
way to doc olivers house which also
contained the doctors office and a
hospital bed or two doc oliver him-
self let barney in at the back door
about time you were showing up
grumbled doc therell be a lynch-
ing bee if you dont do something
pretty quick they tell me ed dow is
sweating blood worrying over wheth-
er he can protect his prisoners now
hes got em
   let him sweat said barney do
him good teach him something how
about that drummer doc is he
thinking ay clearer now
   hes about well enough to travel
if thats what you mean you want
to see him of course
   yeah for a few minutes
   the drummer was sitting up in bed
head encased in a broad white band-
age i know what you want he said
peevishly as soon as barney entered
the room and there is only one
thing i can add to what i told you
before thinking everything over
particularly how they looked-well
there were two of them both masked
and i cant recall anything else but
this the one who shot me when he
cursed and half whirled my way the
tails of the handkerchief he was
masked with sort of fluttered aside
and it seems i recall seeing some-
thing that looked like the edge of a
beard i wouldnt be positive under-
stand-for the next split second
everything went to pieces in thunder
and lightning it aint much-but its
all i can do about it sheriff
  the gleam in barney carrs eyes
had deepened you got no idea how
much that little thing means amigo
thanks-a heap
  at that moment a wild deep
throated concerted yell echoed in
from the street the drummer
squirmed nervously now what he
demanded shrilly the crazy damned
country 
  barney was already on his way
	out just a few of the boys who
need to have their ideas straightened
out he drawled
the mob had made up its mind
the crowd a full hundred strong
was massed before the door of the
sheriffs office swaying growling
cursing-yelling for the prisoners
ed dow stood on the step facing
that mob he had a sawed off shot-
gun held waist high the twin muz-
zles swinging back and forth in a
threatening arc
  sheriff barney carr slipping un-
noticed up to the fringe of the mob
watched ed dow and nodded grimly
worried he told himself-worried
and a little uncertain the kid is but
not one damned bit afraid hell do
 then barney carr went driving
through the mob and he was no long-
er a shuffling amiable easy going old
timer in some strange and mysteri-
ous way he seemed to have grown tall-
er his leathery face was grim and
harsh his puckered eyes full of fluid
ice men who turned to curse him
when he shouldered them aside
quieted suddenly as they glimpsed
that ice in the old mans eyes and
when a burly miner somewhat addled
with drink aimed an angry blow at
barney carr barney gun-whipped
him with the merciless speed of a
pouncing wolf and in two more
strides barney was up on the steps
beside ed dow and turning to face
the mob
  they yelled when they saw who it
was yelled taunts and threats bar-
ney looked them over coolly waited
until they quieted youre clawing
at the wrong corral if you think
youre going to take any prisoners
away from the kid and me he told
them harshly you might as well
break it up and git lynching is out
thats final
  ed dow didnt say a word but bar-
ney heard his deep gulp of relief
 the mob wanted to argue we
want caspian and studinger yelled
one of them were going to string
those two damned crooks up they
should have been hung long ago you
cant keep us away from them
  suddenly barney car was a snarl-
ing old tiger he half crouched and
both big guns leaped into his hands
thats what you think he spat
blood and sweat - or bullets
come and get em if you think
youre good enough ed when i say
the word let em have that buckshot
-both barrels well show em who
runs the law in these parts
  that put it all distinctly up to the
mob and they didnt like the spot
they might have rushed ed dow
had he been alone they might even
have rushed barney carr had he
been alone but the prospect of rush-
ing both these defenders of the law
when one held a sawed off shotgun
and the other a pair of ready and
potent six guns-well that was some-
thing else again
  those in the front rank of the mob
began pushing back away from the
threat of the guns those in back and
reasonably safe if the guns should
bark tried to hold the lines soon
the mob was quarreling and cursing
back and forth among its members
barney carr knew the signs
  they dont want any of it kid
he told ed dow quietly theyll be
heading for the bars to try and drink
their self-respect back pretty quick
barney holstered his guns lifted an
arm for attention i see chet chad-
row and sten vinson out there he
shouted they claim to be the most
hurt by that hold-up ill talk com-
promise with em-but i wont be bull-
ied into anything all right shadrow
want to talk it over well try and hit
some agreement
  listen chief muttered ed dow
in a choked sort of voice i aint
sure but what ive made a damned
fool of myself but caspian and stud-
inger get a fair break before the law
i dont stand for them to be turned
over to shadrow and vinson on any
kind of a compromise that goes
good kid murmured barney
carr youre learning
  the mob knowing its bluff had
been called and anxious to save its
face hailed barney carrs proposi-
tion with a yell of approval shadrow
and vinson were shoved forward and
they came up to the steps sullenly
  im tired boys said barney carr
my feet hurt lets go in and sit
down where we can talk this over
quiet
lie led the way in and relaxed
with a sigh behind his battered
old desk at the rear of the office
was a locked door this led directly
into the jail in back ed dow moved
over and stood with his back to that
door he was taking no chances on
shadrow and vinson pulling some
surprise move and winning a way
past that door to the two prisoners
beyond barney carr smiled slightly
to himself as he noted the move
  shadrow straddled a chair stocky
and sullenly defiant vinson a thin
faced man of medium size nervous as
a cat with all the excitement paced
up and down the room a couple of
times before he sat down
  im surprised at you two said
barney carr in his old amiable man-
ner last men in the world id ex-
pect to see in a mob that aint law
and order and you know it
  it aint law and order to let hold-
ups and killers run loose in this coun-
try either growled chet shadrow
when the man supposed to handle
such things which is you carr wont
get off the dime-why then you got
to expect the boys to take things
into their own hands if ed dow
hadnt listened to reason and gone
out and slapped an arrest on caspian
and studinger them two whelps
might have been clear out of the
county by this time
  buck and milo wouldnt have left
the county drawled barney carr
no need of em to they aint done
anything wrong ed made a mistake
when he went out and arrested them
two but eds young and anxious to
do his duty any kid is liable to get
over-eager and make a mistake so
i aint blaming ed none im blam-
ing and here a distinct edge came
into the old sheriffs voice- im
blaming them who talked ed into it
which ill gamble is you shadrow-
and you vinson i figured youd
probably overplay your hand
  shadrow grew very still in his
chair vinson stirred licking his lips
what you driving at blurted shad-
row i dont like what youre hinting
at
  shouldnt imagine you would
shadrow youre both under arrest
of course im charging you with the
murder of jim dykes and shove
macklin and for robbing the stage
they were driving and guarding ab-

-gun western
ruptly barney carr was a watchful
tiger again arfd his puckered eyes
full of ice
  shadrows laugh was more like a
startled cough than anything else
youre loco he scoffed dont
make me laugh charging me with
holding up my own stage
  of course said vinson thinly
youre senile carr id be liable to
steal the payroll of my own mine
  not your mine vinson rapped
barney curtly you only work there
now lets get down to cases you
werent in town the day of the rob-
bery were you shadrow you passed
out the story that you were at stone
corral well you went out there all
right-in a buckboard but you didnt
stay there you got a saddle bronc
at stone corral and told the folks
there you were riding into baker
valley to look over the road and see
where it needed fixing for stage
travel well you rode into baker
valley all right but then you cut
back down white horse creek where
you met vinson i found out at the
mine that vinson was away during
the time of the hold-up shut up
im talking-and dont try and make
any breaks keep an eye on em ed
barney carr stuffed tobacco
into his old pipe puffed out a
huge cloud of smoke his cold eyes
stabbed back and forth at vinson
and shadrow as he tolled out his
indictment
  so you pulled that holdup there
was a chance jim dykes or shove
macklin might have recognized you
so you shot em down-cold you
thought youd left that traveling man
dead too then you grabbed the pay-
roll money and headed back into the
tut bank country
  there you split up vinson went
out over the hardin valley trail
which leads right around in back of
rawhide peak where the mines are
which made it easy for him to slide
back to the mine soft and cute shad-
row you took to white horse creek
and headed back for baker valley
you thought riding the creek bed
would cover up your tracks well it
did as long as you stayed in it but
you had to come out of it finally and
you did i can show you the exact
pot
  from there you cut across baker
valley and back to stone corral
where you got your buckboard and
drove home to town here and were
very indignant and surprised to hear
about the robbery and then wasted
no time steering talk toward buck
caspian and milo studinger easy
to blame it on them two boys because
of their past records you and vinson
had that angle all figured didnt you
well it might have fooled a kid like
ed dow who is just learning this
law game but it didnt fool me i
been too long at the job of sorting
out humans skunks from decent
folks
  ed dow was listening and watch-
ing like a man mesmerized vinson
had a shriveled hunted look about
him shadrow had a hard glare in his
eyes he laughed harshly
  i can just see you presenting that
kind of hairbrained moonshine in any
law court as evidence carr youd
be put in a straight-jacket and right-
ly youll have to think up something
better than that come on vinson-
hes crazy as a coot
  shadrow started to get up but bar-
ney carr lashed a whip-like order
stay put i aint through i got my
best cards to lay on the table-yet
twelve thousand dollars in that pay
roll pretty nice chunk of cash split
two ways six thousand apiece
enough to make up for any loss of
reputation to your precious stage
line eh shadrow and a pretty juicy
chunk to add to your wages eh vin-
son
  and here is the funny part the
first angle that started me thinking
nobody knew that pay roll money
was coming in i didnt neither did
ed dow and it was a cinch that
buck caspian and milo studinger
didnt no way they could have
learned but you knew it vinson and
you shadrow that fact will make a
big difference in court shadrow
  couple of other things that
drummer saw one thing worth while
before his light went out he just
remembered it and told me about it
half an hour ago the mask of the
gent who shot him fluttered aside
and he saw a portion of a beard
youre the only man in these parts
who wears a beard shadrow and on
top of that-theres this
blood and sweat - or bullets

  from an open drawer barney carr
pulled a reward notice and slapped
it down face up on the desk
wanted for murder and stage rob-
bery droned barney carr remorse-
lessly chet sheldon alias blackie
sheldon and the height and weight
ciata fitsyou like a shirt shadrow
aso it mentions a scar across the
left angle of the chin which a beard
would come in mighty handy to
cover if you ask me well have to
call the barber in to shave that set of
whiskers you pack shadrow just
to be- ah you fool-
 while barney carr had been
speaking shadrows lips had been
peeling back in an ever growing
snarl now he bounced away from his
chair like a cornered cat and his
right hand licked under his vest and
came away bearing the blue-black
bulk of snub nosed shoulder holster
gun but he got the weapon no far-
ther than just into the clear when one
of barney carrs guns stabbed across
the desk top and coughed heavily
  chet shadrow staggered back
dropped his gun made some blind
and aimless passes before his face
with loose and wobbling hands spun
slowly and crashed down shot
through the heart
  barney carr was up and leaning
across his desk smoking gun bearing
on stent vinson dont you try it
vinson rapped barney youd
liave no better luck
  vinson wasnt trying anything he
was shriveled down in his chair face
and eyes ghastly he had to gnaw
at his shaking lips before he could
get out a word it was all-his idea
stammered vinson shrilly and he
did the-the killing he shot dykes
and-and macklin i swear he did i
swear it-i-
  all right ed broke in barney
carr you turn buck caspian and
 ilo studinger loose we got a real
prisoner now
it was getting on toward sun-
down sheriff barney carr had
been making up for lost sleep on the
office bunk ed dow was out around
town telling the world that the best
and smartest sheriff in forty-eight
states was barney carr and if any-
body wanted to say different they
had him ed dow to lick nobody
did
 barney was awake when ed dow
came back in for the first time since
the showdown they were alone ed
dow took off his deputys badge
and laid it on the desk barney
yawned whats that for kid he
asked cheerfully
  i aint got brains enough to be a
law man mumbled ed im going
back to punching cows where a
strong back counts
  you put that badge right back on
where it belongs growled barney
youre doing all right youre doing
fine shucks i came near muffing
things myself take that reward pos-
ter i nearly chucked it away half
a dozen times id had it so long but
each time i looked at it i got the
feeling that id seen that hombre
somewhere so i kept it and not
until i come to suspect shadrow did
i realize who the poster was a picture
of if i hadnt been able to flash that
on him chances are i could never
have bluffed him into a betraying
break because i was guessing plenty
in this game you got to do that once
in a while you got to learn all the
angles
  and me arresting buck and milo
growled ed when was there ever
such a clunk headed fool
 barney chuckled everybody
makes mistakes kid and everybody
has to learn any law man needs
training put that badge back where
it belongs and well go eat

by norman a fox
     hough the blue shadows of
night were crowding down
 from the surrounding peaks
webb freeman could still see many
miles of the wild tangled mustang
country from his porch steps hunk-
ered there his long body folded into
an inverted n the old rancher had
identified the riders toiling up the
trail from town long before sheriff
anvil shane and his posse were with-
in hailing distance it gave webb
time to prepare himself for their
coming but webb was not a top-hand
at deception and his heart was
hammering when the lawman dis-
mounted before his gate
  the posse sat their horses in si-
lence beyond the ranchyard fence and
webb was glad anvil shane was com-
ing in alone he and the sheriff had
been friends for more years than
either could remember even though
things were shaping themselves to
ruin that friendship webb knew he
should be glad to see shane so he
mustered a smile as the squat solid-
looking lawman came on
  how-do anvil he jerked how
come yuhre galavantin away up here
this time o evenin
  shanes gray mustache drooped as
though it were i
registering the  time  hqsobtd
weariness of his  western o
entire body i j  classic
been galavantin 
killers heritage

all day he replied lookin for a
trail that aint
  the jumping jack webb asked
  yeah that black-masked hellion
held up the night stage from missou-
la again but this time its murder
  murder webb echoed
  shorty dale the shot-gun guard
shane amplified shorty made a
damn-fool play at the wrong time and
the jumping jack got him plumb
center
  webb puckered his seamed face
tried to whistle his amazement but
the chill coursing through him froze
his lips if shane had looked at him
then the sheriff would have read the
fear in webbs face but shanes
eyes were probing about the ranch-
yard webb freemans spread had
seen better days for blackleg had
taken a lot of his cattle the season
before but webb knew shane wasnt
looking for the signs of his poverty
  bert around
  my boy nope sent him to comb
a few strays out o the timber webb
replied were kinda short of ready
cash hereabouts so i thought id have
bert drive some stock to the butcher
at mustang
anvil shane digested the in-
formation thoughtfully tugged
at his moustache and webb who
knew shane better than he knew any
man recognized that tell-tale symp-
tom there was something the sheriff
wanted to say but didnt know how
to word
  yuh wanted tuh see bert webb
encouraged
  no-o-o shane countered you
might keep bert close to the place
though he paused reddened
blurted on the whole countrys
just about loco account of this jump-
ing jack folks dont always think
straight when theyre riled up and
theyre apt to be suspicious of a shad-
ow bert does a lot of lopin around
by his lonesome
  the words stiffened webb anvil
shane was voicing webbs own sus-
picions but it hurt like blazes to have
someone else point an accusing
finger at bert freeman something
akin to wrath tinged webbs tone
when he spoke
 yuh mean folks think my boys
the jumpin jack
  now dont get het up shane said
soothingly half the country is sus-
picious of the other half look at it
this way webb youre broke need
money you been a damn good dad to
bert and the younker would probably
do anything to help you out berts
about twenty aint he just at the
wild age when a younkers mady to
do a mans work but aint got a mans
judgment you see how it adds up
 and thats what yuh believe
webb asked weakly
  anvil shane rested a friendly hand
on the oldsters shoulder berts
your son-which means he couldnt be
anything but straight the sheriff
said softly im just showin you
how a lot of folks might figger
things im just suggestin you keep
bert home so nobody can talk
  the kindness in his voice warmed
old webb freeman that speech was
like anvil shane typical of his gener-
ous heart webb had voted for his
old friend election after election and
he could understand why the people
of mustang had unanimously fol-
lowed suit shane was worth it webb
raised grateful eyes was framing a
reply when one of the posse called
the sheriff
 come on the fellow shouted
dont chin all night shane we got
to be riding
 webb recognized that petulant
voice just as he recognized its fancy-
garbed wasp-waisted owner tate
jervis was branch manager of the
western overland stage company
at mustang and webb understood
the mans eagerness to be on the trail
the mysterious black-masked bandit
had been dubbed the jumping jack
because he had flitted from holdup
to holdup but mostly the jumping
jack had concentrated on the gold-
laden stages of the western over-
land the head office at helena had
offered five thousand dollars reward
for his capture rumor had it they
were riding tate jervis pretty hard
prodding him for action on the mat-
ter
  so webb watched anvil shane join
jervis and the others gallop on up
the trail then webb sat alone on
the steps and the shadows gradually

-gun western
 blurring out the surroundings were
 no blacker than his thoughts
   anvil shane had denied that the
 suspicions against bert were his own
 but the sheriff hadnt fooled webb
 shane was giving bert freeman the
 benefit of doubt because anvil shane
 and webb had began a friendship in
 texas thirty years before that
 friendship had matured here in
 montana where both men had mi-
 grated shane and old webb had been
 mighty close but there was one phase
 of webbs life that anvil shane
 didnt know
 anvil shane didnt know about
 the early years of webbs mar-
 ried life shane had been pushing
 cattle north in those days true
  shane had probably heard of wild
 bill leatherby the texas badman
 who had been corraled and sent to
 prison for twenty years but shane
 didnt know webb and his wife had
 adopted the infant son of wild bill
 leatherby to bless their childless
 marriage
  that was webbs secret and
 webbs alone his wife had died a
 dozen years before and wild bill
 leatherby was lost among the shad-
 ows of the past so webb had been
 living with fear and uncertainty
 since the jumping jack had began to
 ride webb had reared bert by the
 same rigid code of honesty that had
 governed webbs own life but blood
 is blood-and bert freeman was the
 son of wild bill leatherby bad-
 man
   the dead past had refused to stay
 buried webb reflected bitterly he
 called bert his son and the boy was
 everything to him that the word im-
 plied he thought of it now and felt
 very old and very much alone then
 as though summoned genii-like by
 his thoughts bert freeman dis-
 mounted at the corral headed for the
 house
   bert might have been his kin for
 the boy was tall and lath-like too
 his shock of hair was the same blue-
 black that webbs had been before
 the years had thinned it and
 sprinkled it with gray slumping
 down beside his foster father the boy
 grinned wanly
   left the beef in the corral up at
 the line shack he reported ill
drive em down to mustang come
morning
 webb remembered anvil shanes
advice about keeping bert at home
but only grunted after all bert was
twenty a man by range standards
bert had taken a lot of the work
from webbs shoulders he couldnt
order the boy to hang around the
ranch-yard from now on
  his hands were tied by berts ma-
turity and next morning he watched
silently as bert rode away it was
the beginning of a week of sheer tor-
ture for the lanky oldster for each
day the boy found something to keep
him in the saddle and webb was
usually in bed when bert returned
by night they always met at break-
fast and facing the boy across the
table webb would choke back
thronging questions he wanted to
ask and couldnt
  once webb saddled up rode down
to mustang there were supplies to
be bought but afterwards webb
prodded himself into the sheriffs
office anvil shane greeted him
wearily and gave him the information
he wanted
  yep the jumping jack held up a
prospector night afore last shane
reported
  there were new worry lines etched
in sianes broad face and a heap of
untouched correspondence was piled
upon his desk webb didnt linger
and he almost collided with tate
jervis as he went through the door
the carefully-dressed western over-
land manager gave webb a long
searching glance as the oldster
grunted his apology
  afterwards webb toiled up the hill
trail to the ranch and found bert ab-
sent nor did the boy show up for
supper webb spent another solitary
evening brooding on the porch steps
and went to bed early but his
thoughts made for sleeplessness he
wondered where bert was riding-
and why and he was still wondering
when bert came in hours later he
heard the boy steal along the hall
pause for a moment at webbs bed-
room door then apparently deciding
the oldster was asleep bert went to
his own room
for long moments webb lay
there listening then impelled by
killers heritage

some undefinable urge he rose picked
up his boots and tiptoed to the porch
pulling on the boots he started for
the barn a phantom-like figure in his
flapping white nightgown the
breeze chilled him and he was glad
to reach the shelter of the barn where
he fumbled for a lantern
  berts horse a deep-chested roan
was in its stall and saddle and gear
were tossed over the stall partition
webb peered about uncertainly over-
whelmed by the fact that he did not
know what he sought the roan had
its nose in a ration of oats and with-
out forethought webb plunged his
hand into the oat bin his probing
fingers closed on something buried
there and he drew the object into
view moving the lantern closer he
examined his find and his eyes wid-
ened with horror
  many men had seen the jumping
jack and all of the victims had re-
ported like descriptions-a tall man
dressed in nondescript range garb
and wearing a black mask sometimes
the details of the garb varied but al-
ways that black mask had been the
insignia of the jumping jack and
webb was clutching such a mask in
his trembling fingers
  he thrust the mask back into the
oat bin blew out the lantern and
reeled toward the house and the
night breeze sighing down from the
peaks seemed to carry the mocking
laughter of wild bill leatherby to
him it was like the death knell of a
lifetimes hopes he had tried to
mould bert freeman after himself
but wild blood had had its way
  webb carried that hideous thought
to bed with him and it kept him toss-
ing and turning until sunup when
he awoke from fitful slumber bert
had left but webb was glad he
didnt have to face his foster son
this morning-and he was glad to be
alone to fight the battle he would
have to fight
 all through the long day he
wrestled with his problem what was
he to do with his knowledge a doz-
en times he thought of facing bert
with an accusation but discarded the
notion bert would naturally deny
everything it would be far better to
go to sheriff anvil shane lay the
facts before him webb owed that
much to his old friend but webb
knew that to do so would be like
betraying his own flesh and blood
  and then when the shadows were
spilling from thf peaks once again
webb heard a clatter of hoofs and
when he hurried to the door sheriff
anvil shane was dismounting before
the gate
  they had arrested bert all day
webb had contemplated betraying
the boy to the law himself but sight
of the squat lawman filled him with
panic shanes first words dispelled
webbs fear however
  im still trailin the jumpin jack
webb the lawman said as he was
ushered to the living room thought
id drop in this way
  reckon yuhll cut his sign one of
these days webb ventured
  maybe so shane reflected and
the proffered rocking chair creaked
with his weight me im tryin
mighty hard had an idea to start
checkin on everybody workin for
western overland seein is how that
hellion always seems to know when
a gold shipments cornin through
tate jervis reckoned it was a good
idea but figgered it would take too
long seems like western overland
is hollerin for blood-and pronto-
so tates got a better idea
  tates a smart hombre
  a gold shipments cornin over
from missoula tomorrow aft-ernoon
shane went on tates having a spe-
cial driver and a special shot-gun
guard hand-picked men likewise
tates riding the stage hisself this
time and hes a good hand with a gun
hes asked me to come along so
theyll be four of us all primed for
trouble if the jumping jack stops
us one of us is bound to get a chance
to make a play the reward is to be
split four ways
  ought to be a cinch if the hom-
bre shows up webb said and his
eyes drilled into shanes just why
yuh tellin me all this anvil
the directness of the ques-
tion staggered anvil shane he
stared wordlessly one hand tugging
at his moustache webb knew that
once again shane had something to
say and didnt know how to say it
spill it he urged the lawman

-gun western
 wa-al i dont exactly know
where to begin shane stammered
yuh see webb this being a lawdog
is a tough job a gent sorta has to
forget hes human and thats mighty
hard sometimes reckon every sheriff
has a day when he wonders which
hes gonna serve-his badge or his-
elf and when a gents had hisself
pulled out of the canadian on a trail
drive and nursed through a seige of
smallpox its sorta hard to for-
get
  if i saved yore carcass a couple
of times webb interjected feeling-
ly it was because i had the chance
reckon yuhd a done likewise
  just the same a lot of waters
gone under the bridge for us two
old-timer anvil shane said hushed-
voiced so heres my say-so if
the jumping jack shows up to-
morrow hell get cut to pieces its
my job to jail that gent-and maybe
ill have to do it some day but
theres a helluva lot of difference
between jailin a hombre and spillin
his guts with a scattergun
  i savvy webb said evenly i sav-
vy and im thankin yuh pard
  his words trailed away for a shad-
ow had fallen between the two men
as bert freeman stood framed in the
doorway for a moment he paused
there nodding cordially he strode
through the room and into the kitch-
en
  watching him go webb wondered
how long bert had been on the porch
how much of the talk he had heard
and wondering he remembered the
things he webb might say to the
sheriff but webbs tongue was
locked
  anvil shane wasnt sure bert was
the jumping jack otherwise the
sheriff would be doing his duty-ar-
resting bert at showdown shane
would be true to his badge but for
the time being he had side-stepped
duty to warn webb of the death trap
waiting the jumping jack and with
bert out there in the kitchen webb
knew he was going to side-step his
obvious duty too
  he walked to the gate with shane
in silence and when the lawman clam-
bered into his saddle webb shook
his hand a long hard grasp eloquent
or his unspoken gratitude then he
watched shane lope away
 returning to the house webb
found bert preparing supper the
oldster helped bert facing him
across the table later spoke for the
first time
  wasnt the sheriff saying some-
thing about a trap for the jumping
jack just before i walked in he
asked between mouthfuls
  yes webb replied and avoided
berts eyes of course its sort of
confidential like but the stage will
be loaded with gunnies tomorrow
theyll get that gent for shore if hes
crazy enough to show up
  covertly he watched for a sign as
he spoke but bert gave none still
the warning had been passed along
at least bert wouldnt tackle the
missoula stage on the morrow webb
carried that consolation to bed with
him and was gladened next day to
see that bert lingered near the ranch
house
tudying him from the porch
webb knew the first measure of
contentment he had tasted in a long
time perhaps the news of the gun-
trap had sobered bert started him
thinking of the odds that are perpet-
ually stacked against those who ride
the owlhoot maybe shane would
never learn the whole truth and bert
might still become the kind of son
webb had hoped he would be
  those were peaceful thoughts and
lingering over them webb felt as
though a load had been lifted from
his heart his chin sank upon his
chest for it was a warm pleasant day
and under the spell of the smiling
skies and his re-born hopes he began
to doze
  he awoke with a start shadows
were spearing downward and the day
was dying fast coming to his feet
webb entered the house found it
empty half-stunned by a budding
fear he lurched into the yard called
berts name only his echo answered
him
  bert was gone and with the reali-
zation webb knew bert had gone to
stop the missoula stage the boy had
been warned but there was one thing
webb had forgotten a thing anvil
shane had put into words when he
had said bert was ready for a mans
work but didnt have a mans judg-
ment for bert with all the self-
killers heritage

assurance of wild bill leatherby
had undoubtedly reasoned he could
turn the tables having been fore-
warned about the gun-trap
  webb thought it all out as he
tossed gear onto his horse then
bolting for the house he stopped to
don a holster-laden belt that he
hadnt worn for a long time he
looked to his gun as he clattered
down the trail and found it ready
for work
  no definite plan shaped itself as
he galloped along he would let cir-
cumstances take care of themselves
when he reached trails end and
trails end would be far below where
lobo canyon cut through the mus-
tang country walling in the road
that squirmed among the hills
  mentally charting the country
ahead webb had a sudden hunch
less than ten miles out of mustang
a spring bubbled beside the canyon
road the stage always stopped there
to allow the passengers time to drink
and to stretch their travel-cramped
limbs the canyons walls sloped
gently at this spot the country was
bush-mottled a perfect place for a
lone bandit to lie in hiding waiting
the advantage that would be his when
the passengers spilled from the stage
to drink
 accordingly webb nosed his
mount toward the promontory look-
ing down on the springs nearing it
he dismounted stalked forward on
foot it was well he had adopted
caution for his hunch was correct
crouching among the bushes at the
canyons crest was the lanky form
of bert freeman
  webb hadnt arrived a minute too
soon the portion of the road below
that he glimpsed was empty but he
could hear the creak of the stage the
cracking drivers whip and he knew
the death-laden coach was just around
a turn and bert was ready to strike
he hadnt donned the black mask yet
but he was looking to his gun testing
the hammer action satisfied he eased
the weapon back into leather again
and at that moment webb moved for-
ward
  three long lunging strides brought
him to his foster sons side jabbing
his gun into berts spine he snatched
the boys weapon thrust it into his
own belt bert stiffened turned his
head and dismay creased his face
dad he gasped
  yes said webb its me son
and im sorry it had to be me id
like tuh think that what yuhve been
doing yuh been doing to help me out
id like to think yuh didnt mean to
cut down on shorty dale but what i
think dont count for much yuh see
son i know yuhre the jumpin jack
i found the mask
  youre  youre makin a mistake
dad bert blurted you
 nope webb said im not mak-
in a mistake this time i made my
mistake a long spell ago but
his words choked him he had
been ready to say his mistake
had been in adopting the son of wild
bill leatherby but gazing at the boy
over the barrel of a gun sudden
moisture stung the oldsters eyes as
he knew a stunning truth regardless
of berts freemans wild blood re-
gardless of the tragic outcome to the
boys career he had raised this
youngster for years he had made
himself believe bert was really his
kin until the thought had become an
actuality and even now at the bitter
end webb freeman didnt want to
change that
 but regardless of his feelings
webbs duty lay clear before him
anvil shane had given bert the bene-
fit of doubt because of a long-fos-
tered friendship and webb had been
content to take advantage of their
friendship and still his own con-
science bert had spoiled that by com-
ing here showing his hand there
was nothing left to do but turn bert
over to the sheriff
 the stage had jerked to a bone-
jolting stop below anvil shane was
piling from the big concord and
wasp-waisted tate jervis was easing
to the ground after him with a nod
of his head webb indicated the trail
leading downward
  move on below bert he said
 bert opened his mouth to speak
but webb never heard him for webb
himself was suddenly shouting a
horror-inspired shriek by the road-
side anvil shane had thrown himself
prone to the ground to bury his face
in the bubbling spring tate jervis

-gun western
was palming a gun leveling it at the
sprawling lawman
  the gun spoke but webb had saved
his old friends life his ear-splitting
shout had disconcerted jervis just as
the mans finger squeezed the trigger
and shane had lifted his head to
listen the bullet that would have
buried itself in the lawmans brain
grazed his head and shane sank for-
ward unconscious
  then tate jervis raised panic-
stricken eyes glimpsed the two on
the crest of the canyon with a hoarse
bellow of rage and fear jervis fired
at them even as he hurled words at
the driver and the shot-gun guard
  gun them two he bellowed
they saw me shoot shane
 webb was charging downward
bert beside him there was a lot the
oldster couldnt understand about the
thing he had witnessed but certain
facts were obvious enough one was
that tate jervis had tried to kill an-
vil shane and the guard and driver
were involved too all three were
plainly bent on killing the witnesses
for bullets buzzed about the freemans
as they dodged and twisted
  webb wasted no time wondering
about the deal his gun was answer-
ing the challenge of those below and
then he rememebered bert was un-
armed snatching the extra weapon
from his belt he passed it over word-
lessly and both went into action
  the guard with his scattergun was
the deadliest menace as they came
into close range and webb broke the
man in the middle with a snap shot
but jervis had truly hand-picked his
driver and jervis himself was no
slouch with a six both were spray-
ing lead that was finding marks and
webb cursed as his thigh flamed with
agony
  but bert was shooting now and
webbs eyes snapped wide as he saw
the deadly efficiency of his foster
son berts gun bucked once a care-
less shot apparently and the driver
reared upward sprawled head fore-
most to the road it was miraculous
bhooting and suddenly webb under-
stood its meaning this was berts
heritage whatever else the boy had
or hadnt gotten from wild bill
leatherby his was the same deadly
hand as his owlhoot sires
then bert crumpled while he
had been gunning the driver tate
jervis had utilized the moment to aim
at the boy the bullet had struck
bert in the leg with a fierce yell of
rage webb brought up his own gun
eared back the hammer and tate
jervis was slammed against the stage
to slip lifeless to the ground
  bloody and disheveled webb free-
man stood panting his oldest friend
still lay silently beside the spring but
though his heart went out to anvil
shane it was bert that he turned to
wincing with pain webb kneeled
gathered the boy in his arms and
something clogged the oldsters
throat when he spoke
  i dont savvy this set-up a-tall
webb said but i do savvy yore gun
saved my bacon today son
  a bullet had furrowed berts scalp
and the boy grinned through a bloody
mask theres things i was gonna
say before the fireworks started
dad he said maybe theyll help
you savvy you see ive been trailin
the jumpin jack for weeks i fin-
gered that five thousand reward
would come in mighty handy out our
way when you told me about the
gun-trap set for today i figgered it
was my last chance either  got the
bandit before he stepped into the
trap-or not at all so i rode out here
to lay for him 
  but jeivis tried tuh shoot anvil
webb muttered in bewilderment and
then the light of truth dawned upon
him i savvy he ejaculated jervis
was the jumping jack shore
enough when anvil figgered on
checkin on the gents workin for
western overland tate got woriied
seein as anvil was gettin close to
the truth so tate talked anvil intuh
takin this ride along with him and
these other two jaspers who must a
been helpin tate all along tate
probably figgered on gettin rid of
anvil and grabbing this gold ship-
ment at the same time afterwards
theyd a reported that the jumpin
jack had did the job
  it all fits bert ruminated slowly
i found a black mask near the west-
ern overland office but i didnt savvy
at the time his grin broadened
and you found the mask out in the
barn reckon i can savvy how things

hardcase or coward
the years had hardened kent varing turned him into
a bitter cold-eyed man whose law lay in his lightning-
fast guns no mere slip of a girl could turn him back
 from the dark trails now
varing riding next to kilrain fol-
lowed the gaze of the outlaw leader
smoke was curling lazily from the
mud chimney of the cabin that hud-
dled amid gaunt cottonwoods at the
foot of a decline three hundred yards
away the place looked desperately
poor but neat at the back of the
entire length its southern outlet was
a thin cleft in the hills that was a
gateway into mexico in spots it was
really a canyon one of these spots
was just beyond the cabin where the
granite walls drew in till they almost
touched
  that wont do russ kilrain was
russ kilrain cursed sudden-
ly with angry surprise and his
upraised hand halted the five
hardfaced riders behind him
what the hell kilrain growled
somebodys took up in that old shack
down there thats bad luck for who-
ever it is it means another killin
the smoky reckless eyes of kent
cabin was a fenced garden green with
young vegetables a few scrawny
cows grazed nearby
 kent varings eyes shifted and
probed thoughtfully the length of the
narrow valley along which they had
been riding it began with the hills
that rimmed the northern end of san
simon basin and traversed the basins
than both their guns
were blasting down
into the gorge

saying weve got to drive cattle
through here we caint afford to
have somebody in that shack they
might talk and cause trouble varing
you got any idea who it might be
kent varing muscularly lean body
slouched in his texas saddle shook
his dark head he said likely a
stranger somebody who hasnt heard
its sudden death to squat hereabouts
or a nester with a bunch of kids
theyve got to get out whoever it
is kilrain scowled first though
well give em a chance to leave peace-
able varing youre acquainted in the
basin and yore picture aint on pieces
of card-board all over the country
you ease down there and look things
over well wait here
  kent varing touched spurs to his
big dun rode through the screening
thicket of cedars and toward the cab-
in a tight sardonic smile twisted his
lips as he rode despite the fact that
his home range was only twenty miles
away in the northern end of the ba-
sin the odds were against his know-
ing whoever was in that dilapidated
cabin hed been away almost five
years
the transformation
wrought by those five years kent
varing realized was bad the basin
had known him as a wild but honest
good-natured buckaroo folks had
grinned and predicted that slim red-
haired barbara wayne would tame
him but a week before her scheduled
marriage to kent varing barbara
wayne had suddenly and without ex-
planation married handsome jack
ivor and the devils that were in kent
varings heart burst their bonds
  hed sworn to kill ivor but dud-
ish whiskey-drinking jack ivor son
of a well-to-do cowman had turned
yellow and refused to fight so kent
varing had ridden away swearing
never to return the last year hed
been riding with russ kilrains gang
over in new mexico kilrain had once
operated here in the san simon run-
ning stolen cattle into mexico but for
the last year hed been away while
things cooled off
  and now kilrain was riding back
kent varing with him varing had
thought this is my chance to get
even with that yella skunk jack ivor
ill help break him then kill him
the years had hardened kent var-
ing turned him into a bitter cold-
eyed hombre whose law lay in his
lightning-fast guns hed severed all
ties with the past except for the
memories he couldnt crowd out
  a spotted puppy bounded from the
porch and came barking and nipping
at the duns legs as varing rode up
and stopped drawn by the racket a
wide-eyed curly-haired boy of no
more than four came onto the porch
and stared solemnly at kent varing
  varing dismounted his silver spurs
jingling as he placed one shiny boot
on the porch he asked you here all
alone sonny
  you aint my daddy lisped the
youngster backing away he called
mummy mummy
  footsteps sounded inside and a low
voice asked what is it billy ia
somebody the voice dwindled
to silence
  kent varing had thought he was
imune to shock but something almost
like a physical blow shook him as his
gaze lifted to the woman in the door-
way this was not the figure of his
dreams that hed seen in the red heart
of a hundred campfires but living
flesh and blood
  barbara whispered kent-kent
varing why-why
  the years had changed barbara too
still slim and pretty but there was a
haunting sadness about her violet
eyes she looked thin tired and her
hands were toil-worn she stood there
looking at varing bewilderment in
her eyes
  varing fought to steady his whirl-
ing mind barbara-here he was con-
scious of resentment for the fact that
she was still able to make him feel
fierce emotions affecting a casual-
ness he didnt feel kent varing
doffed his cream sombrero smiled
tautly
  he said im sorry barbara i-
didnt know you were here
  the youngster was tugging at his
mothers skirts that aint my dad-
dy he piped who is it mummy
barbara said hush billy then
to kent varing i-wont you come
in kent you look tired and hun-
gry
  on an impulse kent varing went
hardcase or coward

into the cabin the room was neat and
clean but almost bare of furnishings
it showed evidence of desperate pov-
erty
  varing asked abruptly barbara
why are you here
  her face pale and still she said
i live here
  and jack ivor
  he lives here too this is our son
billy he was born soon after you-
went away
 jack ivor brought you here-to
live
wistful smile touched her red
lips why not there was no-
where else to go
  questions hammered at kent var-
ings mind and memories flooded
through him when barbara wayne
had married jack ivor without warn-
ing or explanation it had cut deeply
it had shattered his faith in humani-
ty barbaras head had been turned
by jack ivors fancy clothes and
flashy good looks and by the pros-
pect of spending some of old buck
ivors cattle money varing had
thought
 five years ago buck ivor had
owned a big cow outfit jack ivor
had had money to squander on whis-
key and cards and women why then
was barbara here in this squalid
shack
  there was nowhere else to go
barbara said simply uncomplaining-
ly soon after we were married
jacks father died he left us the
ranch but things didnt go well we
lost cattle drought came things
went from bad to worse and we lost
the ranch everything that was a
year and a half ago
  there was a brave tilt to barbaras
chin as she talked kent varing sav-
vied what had happened as much
from what she left unsaid as the
things she said she was still loyal to
jack ivor she didnt say that jack
ivor had gambled their ranch away
and spent it on whiskey and dance
hall flossies but kent varing knew
that was what had happened she
didnt admit that shed married a
weakling and a coward but varing
knew that that knowledge too was
in her mind
  so we came here she went on as
if talking helped her we just moved
in nobody would live here the place
was supposed to be haunted or some-
thing everybody whod ever tried to
live here had been killed or scared
away but we didnt have any choice
weve lived here a year and a half
and nothings happened theres not
much room but the grounds fertile
we have a garden and raise a few
cattle 
  kent varing listened as she talked
on she was trying pitifully to con-
vince him that she was happy and
satisfied here varing knew she was
neither he looked at a row of empty
whiskey bottles on the mantel and
had the answer jack ivor was still
a weakling a wastrel and with him
into the depths he was dragging his
loyal wife and their curly-haired son
  varing knew why they hadnt been
molested here russ kilrain had been
away but now he was back a chill
touched kent varing momentarily
he had forgotten why he was here
kilrains wolves had killed others
whod tried to live here
  kent varing thought why should
i warn them away these two jack
ivor and barbara wayne had humili-
ated him hurt him more than any-
body else in the world theyd sud-
denly turned a world of brightness
and hope into a place of darkness
and bitterness let russ kilrain move
them in his own way  
  billy had lost his shyness fie
climbed hesitantly onto kent varings
lap and tugged with pudgy hands at
the ivory handle of one of his six-
shooters are you a sherff he
asked
  varing grinned said not exact-
ly button he looked at barbara
and knew that she guessed the truth
-that he was an outlaw
  jack should be in soon barbara
said he went to town this evening
i-hell be glad to see you kent are
you alone
  no after all he thought why
should a girl and a curly-haired kid
be made to suffer for jack ivors sins
he said barbara youve got to leave
here
  leave here she shook her head
we couldnt do that we have no

-gun western
where else to go why should we
leave here
  people have died here in this cab-
in
 but that was several years ago
nobody has bothered us
  they might if you stay you must
leave as soon as you can
barbara shook her head again
i know you have a reason for
saying those things kent but weve
got to stay here-got to its our
only chance jacks only chance i
know i havent fooled you you know
why we lost everything why were
living here jacks weak hes always
had too much i made him come here
i thought away from everybody he
might-do better in time he may its
his only chance our only chance i
married him and ill stick with him
i owe him that much
 varing fought back the words of
contempt he felt for jack ivor that
came to his lips he said if you feel
that way 
 barbara had quieted her eyes
steady she said i owe you some-
thing kent varing i know how ter-
ribly i hurt you i want you to know
why i married jack ivor without
even telling you i aimed to do it it
can do no harm now i did it for an
old old reason money-money jack
ivor promised to pay off a mortgage
on daddys ranch with jack wouldnt
let me explain or even tell you what
i meant to do
  so i married him but i didnt get
the money daddy lost the ranch and
it broke his heart he died soon after
then buck ivor died and jack
seemed to go to pieces
 fresh hate and contempt for jack
ivor welled inside kent varing he
got to his feet he didnt want to see
tack ivor for fear of what he might
do
 barbara had got to her feet and
gone to the window she said here
comes jack now
 varing heard hoofbeats outside
they stopped at the rear of the cab-
in and footsteps sounded as some-
body entered through a back doorway
the footsteps came through a back
room then jack ivor stood in the
doorway
  again shock over-rode the hate that
smouldered inside varing this
wasnt the old debonair jack ivor
hed known the old swaggering arro-
gant dandy a stubble of beard cov-
ered ivors gaunt face his eyes were
bleary his clothes were dirty un-
kempt jack ivor had a quart bottle
in his hand and he swayed a little
as he squinted in the sudden change
from sunlight to shadow
  jack ivor asked barbara whose
bronc is that outside and whore
them hombres coyotin out behind the
thicket
  and barbara said softly jack
heres an old friend of yours kent
varing 
  jack ivor stiffened took a back-
ward step then his eyes focused on
varing and he laughed sneeringly
no need to come sneakin back now
varing shes my wife now remember
that
  barbara flushed said pleadingly
jack please kent didnt know we
lived here when he stopped
  then why is he here ivor asked
anyway he knows it now hes not
wanted here is that plain varing
kent varing held himself rigidly
in check plain enough your skunk
smell is worse than ever ivor it must
be hell to have to stand it for five
years five seconds is too long for
me
kent varing whirled strode
from the cabin he swung into the
saddle his brown hawkish features
harsh with anger and sent the dun at
a gallop up the incline and through
the cedars to where russ kilrain and
the others waited
  it took you a hell of a long time
the burly red-bearded kilrain
growled impatiently whos down
there
  just a woman and a kid
  i saw a man ride up on a hoss a
minute ago what about him
  varing shrugged said he dont
count soused to the gills and yella
name of jack ivor
  ivor huh kilrain grunted ive
had dealins with him hes yella all
right and treacherous he caint be
trusted rather have most anybody
there than him did you tell em to
get out
hardcase or coward

  no varing said tautly i fig-
ured-
  youre not supposed to do any fig-
urin kilrain snapped hard-eyed
youre supposed to do as youre told
im not so blasted finicky you gents
wait here a minute
  russ kilrain whirled his big black
sent it pounding down the decline
kent varing watching saw him fling
from the saddle and stride into the
cabin he was in the cabin no more
than sixty seconds then he came out
mounted and rode back to his waiting
men a grin was on kilrains thin
cruel lips
  i gave em till midnight to pack
and get out he said told em id
be back then well lte ride
  kilrains four henchmen grinned
wolfishly they were hard men scum
of the outlaw trails murder was the
kind of work they enjoyed kent var-
ing said nothing as they rode on
through the notch beyond the cabin
and along the widening valley he
tried to hide from kilrain and the
others the turmoil that was in his
mind
  the sun was sinking into its nest
of blue hills when they arrived at
the hideout-a big log cabin huddled
back under the walls of a niddon can-
yon until his depredations had be-
come too bold a couple of years ago
kilrain had operated from this head-
quarters driving stolen cattle south-
ward into mexico their trail to the
border lay along the canyon-like val-
ley theyd traversed that evening
  the horses were watered at a lit-
tle stream that trickled along the
canyon and turned loose in a rude
pole corral kent varing remained
aloof from the others as they pre-
pared a meager meal and wolfed it
hed never liked them only his bit-
terness had driven him to seek their
reckless company
  ivors yella all right kilrain had
said but the gals got spunk she
the same as told me to go to blazes
she said they wouldnt leave and that
i	couldnt make em well mebbe i
caint but i shore as hell can plant
em
 you cant kill a woman and a
kid varing said softly
  caint i russ kilrain growled
if theyre not outa that shack by
midnight ill burn it over their
heads
  varing shrugged let the subject
drop kilrain would carry out his
threat he knew kent varing thought
well why not hed come back for
vengeance against jack ivor but now
there was no savor to the thought
jack ivors cattle were gone and ivor
himself was a broken whiskey-soaked
derelict without courage or hope
vengeance against jack ivor would
be tasteless now
after eating kent varing
went outside a white moon had
soared into the sky the hills were
cool and quiet and peaceful but there
was no peace in kent varings mind
he kept seeing the shadows in bar-
baras tired eyes he kept feeling the
tug of a curly-haired youngsters
pudgy hands
  barbara wouldnt leave shed said
weve got to stay here its our only
chance his only chance
  barbara and the youngster would be
better off with jack ivor dead but
if ivor died theyd die too 
 kent varing roped his dun from
the corral and saddled him then he
went back to the cabin it still lacked
three hours till midnight kilrain and
his four followers were seated about
a rude table dealing blackjack
  kent varing stood just inside the
doorway he said kilrain youll
have to pull that job tonight without
me im takin a little ride mebby
ill be back mebby not
  surprise leaped into the eyes of
kilrain and the others then russ
kilrains reddish eyes went bleak and
wary you pettin cold feet var-
ing he asked
  varing said softly call it what
you like i just dont cotton to mur-
derin women and kids
  so thats it kilrain purred you
wouldnt have any ideas about double-
crossin us would you varing
varing shrugged said my ideas
are my own business im ridin now
and ill have a gun lined on this door
till im out of sight adios
 he backed through the doorway
and to his horse his eyes never left
the lighted doorway as he swung into

-gun western
the saddle and spurred through the
jackpines that hemmed the cabin
  he put the dun into a mile-eating
lope and headed southward he knew
he was doing a crazy thing but he
had to get barbara and the boy out
of that cabin jack ivor had dragged
them down to disgrace and shame
ntow unless they left that cabin
theyd die
  kent varing knew that kilrain
would be furious at his desertion and
suspicious maybe he wouldnt wait
till midnight to start on his murder-
ous mission
  the moon was high in the sky when
varing pushed his tired dun through
the canyon mouth and stopped before
jack ivors cabin the cabin was dark
and quiet hope lifted inside kent
varing maybe after all kilrains
warning had had its effect
  then suddenly a puppy started
barking excitedly inside the cabin
billy would never have gone off with-
out the pup kent varing dismounted
stepped across the porch and rapped
on the door with his knuckles for a
moment there was deathly silence
even the pup had stopped barking
  then barbaras voice calm but de-
fiant called out get away from that
door or ill rhoot
  varing said barbara its me-
kent varing open the door
  and jack ivors voice high-pitched
fearful dont open the door-its a
trick varings one of kilrains gang
dont open the door
  but footsteps sounded a latch lift-
ed and the door opened barbara
stood revealed in murky light a gun
in her hand and varing saw that the
windows had been blinded there
wasnt any fear or distrust on bar-
baras pale face as she stood aside
for kent varing to enter varing
stepped inside closed it and stood
with his back to it
plainly preparations for a fight
had been made there was an air
of tension in the room barbara was
dressed in denims and shirt billy
huddled on a pallet on the floor eyes
wide and bewildered his puppy
clutched in his arms jack ivor stood
against the wall repeating rifle in his
hands ivors face was ghastly pale
through his stubble of beard his
hands were shaking and stark fear
showed in his staring eyes
  jack ivor said shrilly blast you
varing i know what youre up to
russ kilrain sent you put up your
hands or ill cut you in two
  please jack barbara said sharp-
ly then what is it kent
  all of you must leave here now
varing said swiftly ignoring jack
ivor theres no time to explain
you dont need to explain bar-
bara said quietly russ kilrain if
that was his name made everythftig
pretty plain when he was here this
evening he told us to leave or hed
kill us
  varing said to jack ivor you fool
why havent you taken her and the boy
away kilrain wasnt bluffing he
may show up any minute
  jack ivor was plucking nervously at
the buttons on his dirty shirt his lips
seemed stiff i tried to get her to
leave he whined i told her kilrain
would kill us all but she wouldnt
leave maybe shell listen to you
varing
  i wont barbara declared firmly
if we left here wed have nothing no
place to go wed be out on the prairie
homeless with the rain and wind in
our faces what we have here is piti-
fully little but it holds all our hopes
for the future its worth fighting for
worth dying for if we have to
  there are other places barbara
jack ivor said pleadingly i-i know
i	havent been much of a husband ive
been weak worthless ive dragged
you and the boy down with me but
leave here with me barbara and i
promise you things will be different
ill get a job ill quit whiskey and all
the other things ill be a man
  b a r b a r as face was pale and
strained but she was adamant
  she said if you want to be a man
youll never have a better chance than
to be one right here tonight
  billy had gotten up from the pallet
he went to jack ivor and looked up
into his fear-distorted face
im not afraid he lisped my
daddy wont let anybody hurt me
jack ivor looked down at th
youngster as if just then aware of hi
existance his trembling finger
hardcase or coward

touched the curly head he opened his
lips as if to speak then closcd them
  kent varing said to barbara then
you wont leave
  she shook her head i wont leave
but youd better go now kent it may
be too late in a little while
  varing shook his own head an odd
exaltation had lifted inside him me
said if you stay barbara i stay
well fight
  there was nothing to do except
wait they talked little barbara was
quiet-eyed tense billy huddled again
with his puppy in his arms jack ivor
had quieted some several times he
drank from the quart bottle on the
mantel but he was still nervous he
paced the floor the rifle in his hands
barbara had nailed thick boards
over the windows leaving cracks
to fire through they barricaded the
doors kent varing crouched at a win-
dow where he could watch through a
chink the dim trail that snaked
through the narrow canyon pass three
hundred yards above the cabin
through this pass russ kilrain and
his gun-wolves would come
  kent varing smiled sardonically in
the dim lamplight kent varing out-
law waiting to fight probably die for
the very ones who had driven him out
onto the owlhoot he knew they
wouldnt have much of a chance
against kilrains killers they could
hold them off a while but there could
be but one ending
  barbara and jack ivor must have
realized that too but the girl showed
no signs of fear or regret she had
nothing to lose perhaps nothing to
gain but she meant to fight varing
looked at jack ivor ivor had paused
beside the pallet
  billys pudgy fingers were tugging
at the tattered leg of ivors levis he
heard billy say daddy you wont let
anybody hurt me will you
  jack ivor started looked down at
the boy he said hoarsely i-dont
you worry button i-ill take care of
you then ivor went to the mantel
reached a shaking hand for the bottle
  kent varing turned back to the win-
dow he didnt feel any contempt for
jack ivors weakness and cowardice
now a coyote couldnt change into
a wolf
  jutting against the moonlit sky
kent varing could see dark moun-
tains the mountains looked friendly
and inviting the silvery moonlight
gleaming on their crests looked like a
beckoning finger beyond those
mountains was safety for kent var-
ing here in this cabin was death
there was yet time to ride
  kent varing grimaced in the dim
light guns in hand he hunkered
lower beside the window he knew
that midnight was almost at hand
any minute now russ kilrain would
come  
 he heard billy ask mummy
wheres my daddy
  varing turned jack ivor wasnt in
the room now varing remembered
hearing ivor in the kitchen a little
while before moving something about
strengthening the barricade hed
thought
  barbara was looking at kent var-
ing a mute question in her eyes var-
ing got to his feet went into the tiny
back room jack ivor wasnt there
the barricade had been pulled aside
the door was slightly ajar jack ivor
was gone
  he replaced the barricade returned
to the front room he looked into bar-
baras wide questioning eyes and
nodded barbara bowed her head and
varing thought he heard a sob he
went back to his vigil at the window
  billy had crossed to his mother he
asked wheres my daddy he said
hed take care of me
 daddyll-be back in a little
while barbara said hell take care
of us you go back and lie down
  harsh anger rioted through kent
varing jack ivor was lower even than
hed thought to save his own cow-
ardly hide ivor had deserted his wife
and child just when they needed him
most varing remembered what bar-
bara had said a little while ago if
you want to be a man youll never
have a better chance than to be one
right here tonight
 jack ivor hadnt taken that
chance
-gun western -  big stories
then kent varing tried to
forget about jack ivor ivors de-
sertion had cut down their already
slim chances barbara realized that
too her tanned face was strained and
pale in the dim light billy sensing
at last that something awful was
about to happen had begun to whim-
per
  kent varing tensed suddenly faint
yet plainly audible on the still night
air he heard the sound of hoofs eyes
glued to the crack in the window he
stared into the shadowy mouth of the
pass three hundred yards away he
could see nothing yet he knew that
kilrains renegades were coming
  then all at once the canyon mouth
seemed to explode in a red burst of
fury before kent varings eyes a
blasting roar of gunfire beat against
his eardrums and the pass was criss-
crossed with writhing tongues of gun-
flame in the gunpowder torches he
could see weird leaping figures
  kent varing leaped to his feet he
tore the barricade from in front of the
door hurled his body through the
opening and started running toward
the canyon mouth the pass was still
a fiery chaos of leaping flame and
boiling gunsmoke of screaming lead
and yelling confused men
  varings pumping legs seemed to
carry him at a snails pace toward the
pass he was aware that barbaras
slim flying figure was beside him he
could see moonlight gleaming on the
gun in her hand side by side they
leaped into the canyon mouth
  the gunfire had slackened rider-
less horses were pounding along the
canyon motionless figures lay on the
ground then two mounted figures
loomed before kent varing theyd
seen varing and the girl in the moon-
light and their guns started blazing
kent varing heard the waspish hiss of
lead he felt a fiery sting as a bullet
grazed his thigh
  then his own deadly guns started
hammering and flaming he heard the
blasting roar of barbaras  beside
him fresh sound beat back from the
canyon walls the shadows churned
with cyclonic gun-fury in the red
glow varing saw one of the mounted
figures suddenly drop his gun and
tumble stiffly to the ground
  then as suddenly as it had begun
the gunfire subsided whipped by the
chill wind gunsmoke rolled like a fog
up out of the gorge and the ribbon of
moonlight that penetrated to the floor
of the canyon revealed six dead men
one of them was russ kilrain four
others were his henchmen
  the sixth man was jack ivor jack
ivor sat with his back against a wall
the still-smoking muzzle of his rifle
thrust over a boulder before him he
didnt look scared or weak now as he
died there had been a soft smile on
jack ivors gaunt bearded face like
he was thinking of something pleas-
ant
 jack ivor had said dont you
worry button i-ill take care of
you and he had hed made it pos-
sible for them all to live
  barbara was sobbing softly and
kent varing put his arm about her
slim figure and led her out of the
canyon-toward a future that had been
purged of its bitterness and glowed
bright with promise of happiness a
future made possible by a man who
afraid to live had in the end found
something worth dying for end
