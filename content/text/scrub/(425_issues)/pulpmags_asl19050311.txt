the hauntkd gym

 whack crack  whack crack  lub-bnib-blub
 bang thump

 these were the sounds that came from the gymnat
 sium over the old carriage shop and caused jack light-
 foot and the boys with him to jump for the doorway
 fof the purpose of investigating

 howling mackerels ned skeen gasped as the
 sounds continued hear that its getting worse

 even lazy liafe lampton was stirred into a quick
 run

 the hoys had bfcen near the gym on their way to
 fit for a meeting ef the high-school athletic club was
 to be held there that night
all-sports

  they had expected to light the lamps and get the
fire to going well in the big stove so that everything
would be comfortable when the other members ar-
lived

  thump crack blub-rub-bubt whang thump

  jiminy crickets said lafe somebodys got in
there and i smashing everything up for us

  that was the thought of all

  they knew they had some enemies in cranford
and they suspected these evil wishers rather than any
of their rivals of the crarflord academy club

  yet there w-ere some members of the academy or-
ganization who were mean enough they belieyed to do
that very thing-smash up the apparatus in thehigh-
school gym

  it may be well to explain to any who have not read
the previous stories in this series that the gymnasium
spoken of here as the high-school gym did not belong
tothe high school in any proper sense but to the club
of young students whose captain and leader was jack
lightfoot

  i he club room arid gym occupied the upper floor
of an old ind abandoned carriage shop and was given
rent free to the boys by norwell strawn proprietor
of strawns dry-goods store whose daughter kate
had been saved from drowning by jack lightfoot at a
time when she skated into a hole in the ice of cran-
ford lake

  wow the scamp must be tearing the doors down
said bob brewster the big red-haired giant of the
club k  get -my grippers on him ill twist his
neck

  well paste him for that fellows cried ned
skeen

  jack lightfoot had done more running than talking
and reached the door first

  he fitted the ky quickly tfe the lock and ihmgyfhe
door open

library

 then the boys raced for the stairs that led ta tt

upper floor	

 before they gained the stairway the sounds ha

 ceased

 go outside some of you jack commanded
 may try to get out by the windows and jump dovi
 from he shed roof

 bill- brewster and nat kimball turned back in
 fairly falling on himself as hp struggled to get out
 the door quickly

 jack mounted lightly to the top floor witht n
 skeen and lafe lampton at his heels

 the gym was still dark-so dark that when th
 reached the door-at the head of the stairs and hi
 thrown it openthey could noteven see the furnishing

 they stood there a moment breathing hard and 
 tening

 there was not a sound other than what they ma
 themselves

 look lively out there dont let him get off t
 roof i

 jack shouted this to the boys outside

 then with trembling fingers he struck a match

 one of thekerosene lamps used in lighting thjgj
 was on a stand by the door and when the flamc of t
 match revealed nothing he lit the lamp

 hq isnt in here said skeen and turned to c
 scend the stairs in order to watch from the outside

 in doing so he stumbled and fell half the lengtm
 the stairway bringing up at the bottom with a clattj

 any bones broke jack queried

 n-no im alltight

 with a sense of relief they heard him leap up i

 one of the boys outside having heard that clatti
 came bounding through the doorway

 stay outside skeen bellowed at him i doi
 think hes in the gym

 then hes on the roof brewster was heard tor c
all-sports library

 cfare he hasnt got off bf it for weve beefr watch-
 ing

 jack now advanced into the gymnasium holding the
 lamp before him and was followed by lafe lampton

 when he had proceeded a yard or two he stopped
 and looked about trying to flash the light into the
 dark corners

 both jack and lafe had a nervous feeling that was
 not fear as they expected momentarily to see he au-
 thor of those strange sounds bounce out of some cor-
 ner and leap for the stairway or for a window

 when nothing of the kind happened jack went on
 igain holding up the lamp

 they crossed the room discovering nothing

 no one in here  said lafe

 no

 whats become of him 

 jack walked up to a pile of boards from which some
 lew gymnastic apparatus was to be made by he club

 nembers

 he looked behind this then swept his glance round
 the whole of the room

 what surprised him as much as anything was that
 lot a thing within the gym seemed to have been dis-
 urbed the indian clubs dumb-bells leaping pad
 rhairs in fact all the movable articles were in place
 ind appeared not to have been touched

 jack was mystified

 going to the nearest window opening upon the shed
 roof he looked out on the shed

 as before lafe followed him and also looked out

 the night was rather dark though stars were shin-
 ing

 theres no one on the shed i think said jack

 then he called to the boys below

 you must have st the fellow get by you 

 not on your life we didnt came the answer

 well theres no one here	

 oh hes in there somewhere

 jack withdrew his head and made another search
 of the gym with the same result

 theres nobody in here and i know it lafe de-
 clared when they had gone over the whole upper flooi-
 three or four times

 youre right theresno one here

 and nobody on the shed roof

 we couldnt see anyone there

 lafe whistled

 jiminy crickets this is queer -

 too queer for anything admitted jack feeling
 undeniably foolish and nervous he must be either
 here or an the shed roof or else he got away

 he might be in the room below lafe suggested

 it seemed almost impossible that this could be so
 for the boys had been almost at the foot of the stairs
 before the strange whacking and thumping in the gym
 had ceased

 nevertheless lafe lighted a lamp and with fhis in
 his hand he went downstairs and began a search
 through the old carriage shop

 jack went to the window again and informed the
 boy of what lafe was doing and asked them to still
 keep a sharp lookout

 by and by he went himself down intq the lower
 room carrying his lamp but leaving another one
 lighted in the gymnasium

 the boys outside were in a state of mingled suspense
 and mystified curiosity it seemed to them that any-
 thing might happen now

 on the lower floor were stored some old buggies
 wagons and broken-down carriages together with
 rusty tires splintered wheels and the like

 jack searched all over this lower floor accompanied
 by lafe and did not stop until it was certain no one
 was hiding there

 then he went to the door

 well this is a puzzler fellows there isnt a soul
 upstairs nor down theres no other place that chap
	atl-sports

could have gone to so he must have slipped out upon
the shed roof im going up to the gym and climb out
on that roof if hes there ill find him

  look out that he dont tackle you and pitch you
off skeen warned

  he must be on that roof said jack unless you
let him hop down and skip out here right under your
noses

  not so much as a mouse hopped downhere nat
kimball asserted

  jack went again into the gymnasium and climbed
out on the shed roof

  he took with him a lantern not willing to trust his
sight in that poor light and with this means of illumi-
nation he searched the shed roof from one end to
the other

  nothing up here he shouted

  howling mackerels cried skeen who was now in
a nervous fever

  jack retraced his way to the gym and closed the
window

  then he went downstairs again

  fellows he said and his tone was serious where
did that chap go its a riddle and im not good at
guessing

  even yet the boys were not willing to believe that
the person who had invaded the gym and made all
that noise could have escaped from the building and
they proposed a further search

                                      

  other members of the club began to arrive and
they joined in this search when they heard the strange
and startling story

  upstairs and downstairs on the shed roof under
and in the old buggies and carriages the club members
looked

  when at length they gave it up as hopeless and
gathered in the gymnasium with nearly every mem-
ber present now some of them had passed from aston-
ishment to superstition

library

  arlo kilfoyle gave voice to what some of the others
  were beginning to think when he said 

  it looks to me as if the old place must be haunted
  haunted your granny cried nat kimball

  well you believe in things as queer as that
  what tell me what

  germs for instance

  well thats science and common sense everybody
  knows there are germs and a lot of them but whoever
  saw a ghost 

 whoever saw a germ

  they cant be seen of course without a micro-

  and ghosts cant be seen unless youre in a propelj
  condition to see them

  jack lightfoot laughed

 we must have been in proper condition to head
 them to-night

  thats just it you were

  all of us

  every one of you

  jack laughed again for kilfoyle seemed to be in
  sober earnest

  oh thats all rot said lafe lampton

  he took out an apple which he split open with his
  hands intending to give jhalf to thd boy who sat nex
  to him

 then everyone laughed when they saw the twc
 halves of the apple

  thats rot all right-that apple cried skeen
  lafe opened the door of the stove in much a fim
  was now roaring and tossed the rotten apple into it
  its all rot about ghosts

  well then smarty you explain what made thosd
   noises said kilfoyle there was some one in here
  according to your own story but when you came lie
  jvasnt in here and he had no chance to get out
  kilfoyle looked round and then almost fell out of
  his chair as a strange sound seemed to come from thd
  floor beneath him
all-sports library

 it was like a groan

 say cried nat kimball anxiously and almost
 ingrily jif any of you fellows have been practicing up
 on ventriloquism and are trying it here i dont think
 its smart of you

 all declared their innocence

 nat happened to think of ventriloquism because in
 iddition to his jiu-jitsu studies he had been poring
 over some pamphlets that professed to explain the
 methods of the ventriloquist

  all sat listening kilfoyle with his eyes wide open in
 a glassy stare of fright

 nothing more was heard however

  kilfoyle got up

 im going home he said you fellows can stay
 here as longas you please

 he arose and beat a retreat to the staifway and then
 drew back when he observed that the lower floor was
 linlighted

 taking a lamp he descended with it and leaving
 it on the floor of the lower room he departed from
 the old carriage shop to tell the story of the strange
 manifestations

 the other boys remained talking the thing over
 seriously

 but the mystery was not to be solved by talk

 when at a rather late hour for the club whose
 members tried to reach home early after a meeting
 they had left the building and were proceeding up the
 street their ears were again assailed by those mys-
 terious noises

 whack bang blub-bub-blub thump bang

 they ran back as quickly as they could and again
 while the outside of the shop was guarded another
 search was made

 this search resulted as before

 nothing could be found and nothing further was
 heard

 there were no evidences the next morning that the

 carriage shop had been visited except by the club
 members and not a thing could be discovered that
 would give the slightest clew to what appeared to be
 an impenetrable mystery

   and as a result fnore than one aged woman and
man in cranford stood ready to declare that the old
carriage shop was haunted and they told tales of
strange happenings in the shop in days gone by and
especially dilated on the fact that the man who bflilt
the shop and ran it at first had fallen into the lake one
night and been drowned and his bodv had never been
recovered

   a more than a ten-days sensation in cranford
seemed to be promised

chapter ii

practice on the diamond

   the call of spring was stirring in the blood of the
boys of the high-school athletic club as they gathered
on the diamond in the old fair grounds where the
athletic events had been pulled off in the recent tourna-
ment

   signs of spring were becoming apparent

   the snow was gone the lake and the rivers were
clear of ice and robins were hopping about in search
of worms perking their heads and looking wisely at
the passers-by

   yet in our changeable climate winter might return
 with a suddenness that would cause these signs to be
 forgotten and the land might be covered again with
 snow

   but the high-school boys did not think this likely
 and as they stood about and the ball was thrown from
 one to another while bats were flourished they began
 to talk of the trip into the woods which they had
 planned should take place as soon as the weather was
 fit

   by hemlock i know the fish air bitin i said jubal

 you ought to be a good run-getter jube jack
 remarked a left-handed batter has a- advantage
 over a right-handed one he is likely td trouble the

 it came like a bullet and twisted to tile right and
 igain jubal threshed his club through the empty at
 nosphere

 out  three strikes and out

 now ill give you an easy pne said jack and i
 vant you to try to bunt it a left-handed batter has
  good chance if he can stop the ball with skill he
 in if he is quick bunt he ball and be away from
 he plate before it hits the ground now look out
 eady

 he sent in an easy one but it was high and jubal
 ailed to get it

 but he did better the next time and bunting the ball
 lown in front of the plate he was able to reach first

 youve got to look lively there lafe jack warned
 no time for apple eating

 lafe lampton walked out leisurely and as leisurely
 hrew the ball down to the box

 but this isnt a real game lie urged

 no it isnt-just practice but if were slovenly
 nd slow in practice well be that way when we go
 nto a real game quickness alertness and sureness-
 hose are the things that count

 nat kimball took u the club and stepped into posi-
 ion

 whats the best way to stand v he asked as he
 aced the pitcher

 that depends on the rrlan jack answered some
 ike to stand as cloge up to the plate as the rules will
 how others stand away from it a little there used

 o	be a professional player on the bostons who tood
 tearly three feet away from the plate and he was a
 freat batter but he was a remarkable exception

 he was turning the ball round in his hands as he
 alked and looking at kimball

 thats a pretty good position youve got now he
 aid but remember one hing youre to watch me
 f i yere pitching in a game id try to throw ypu just

 the nd of ball you werent looking for or if i had
 found out what was the hardest ball foryou to bat
 i might throw you that if you keep your eyes w
 peeled you can often detect a curve just as it breaks it
 its course and have tifne to land on the ball

  he threw with a quick jerk and the ball coming
straight though with good speed kimball cracked it
ojit into left field

  arlo kilfoyle who fais out there fumbled it and
almost fell down and kimball took second

  kimball on second began to look for a chance to
steal

  jack spoke to him

  theres just one thing kimball i want to call your
attention t now when you-hit thball and get away
for first never look back to see where the ball has
gone judge that from the action of the first baseman
you slowed up when yot looked back atid you might
have been put out

  but i made second  kimball argued

  true you did this time but im giving you rules
to cover your base running generally

  thus the practice oh the diamond went on and all
the while jack lightfoot was carefully sizing up his
men and judging as best he could in what positions
they would be able to d their best work

all kinds of sports and baseball especially seemed
  
to come as a natural knaek to jack lightfoot yet no
boy in cranford had studied the game-jnore closely or
practiced more assiduously

  in addition to this he was -a barn leader knowing
how to get the best work put of those under him and
though he had his failings as most boys have he had
innumerable good qualities to offset them

  the entire time of the boys was riot given however
to practice and the discussion of the rules and the fine
points of ball playing

  they could not get out of their minds the strange
occurrences in the gymnasium the preceding evening


all-sports library

  oh this talk that the gym is haunted by the ghost
of that old fellow who was drowned and who first
owned the building is the worst kind of rot said
lafe emphasizing his belief by a wise shake of his
head

  well id just like to meet the guy who is trying
to be smart in that way was the assertion of fighting
saul messenger

  well watch for him to-night said jack ive
already spoken to kennedy and hes going to keep an
eye out down there to see if he can discover anybody
lurking round the building

  none of the fellows not even arlo kilfoyle was
willing to believe now that there was anything super-
natural in the nois they had heard strange as those
noises had been

  daylight had strengthened kilfoyles nerves

  ghosts are never seen by daylight and even the most
superstitious feels that he can defy them when the
sun is shining brightly over his head

  still fellows the thing was awfully queer nat
kimball asserted

  howling mackerels queer was no name for it
said ned skeen

  and everyone there could agree to that

chapter iii

a pair of plotters

  nicholas flint dark sinister of features with high
cheek bones and black eyes that glittered like those of
an apache was making his way across lots some dis-
tance above the diamond

  his way lay between the old fair grounds where
the high-school boys were practicing and the railway
that ran from east to west through the town of cran-
ford

  from his higher elevation he could look down into
the fair grounds and see the boys as he had already
heard them

  as he looked the black eyes glowed avid snapped
with hidden fire

  flint did not like jack lightfoot

  it will do me good to get a chance to punch the
head off of that guy he muttered standing in the
open lot and looking down at the pitchers box froir
which jack was handing out those practice balls he
thinks hes too smart for anything oh ill hammei
him

  flints particular grievance at this time was thai
jack had refused to let him substitute on the new
high-school nine

  he did not attend school much but he fancied tha-
this should not disqualify him

  it did not in truth for jube marlin who could no
be called a regular school attendant was on the list o
substitutes

  what disqualified nicholas flint in jacks estima
tion was his utter unreliability his untruthfulness hi
quarrelsome disposition and the fact that altogether
he was about as unpromising a boy as could be chosen
for he was no ball player and likely never could be
come one

  what jack lightfoot sought for was good basebal
material and while he was glad to have his friends 
the nine if they were good players he would not evei
put a chum on unless that boy could add strength u
the nine

                                                                   i

  and certainly if he would not put on a friend wlv
was a poor player he would not tise so wretched i
athlete as nicholas flint just to please him and avo
his anger

  when i get through with him he wont be at
to lift his arm above his head let alone pitch a ball
flint threatened mouthing away to himself in his ra
as he walked on oh ill hammer him

  then he stopped for coming to a little hollov
where the sun beat in warmly against a stone he s
all-sports library	o

 lying there the one boy he was just tnen anxious to
 see -bat arnold

  hello said bat looking up lazily for the warm
 sunshine made him feel indolent

  nick flint glanced quickly around and then dropped
 as quickly into the cavity where bat lay

  ive been watching the high-school crowd down
 there said bat then added in an ironical way-you
 pught to be on that nine

  nick did not catch the irony in this he thought the
 itvords were spoken in sober earnest

  i would have been but for that puppy jack light
 toot

  bat laughed lazily

  oh i mean it i wanted to play substitute you
 mow i can run continued flint

  oh you can run all right admitted bat laughing
 gain when he remembered that he had once seen nick
 running like a sprinter from kennedy the night yatch-
 nan

  what are you laughing about i dont see any-
 hing funny

  i dont see anything funny-but you

  me

  yes its funny that you should imagine for a min-
 lte that jack lightfoot would letyou sub hed never
 lo it you dont belong in his crowd you aint fine-
 taired enough youve got to be swell and away up
 rou know a nice little clean little honest little boy to
 iplay with such a darling as jack lightfoot

  he spoke with a sneer then laughed again in a way

 o	foake flints dark cheeks flush

  jube marlin isnt swell or rich or away up and
 irhen you come to that jacks mother hasnt got any
 noney much that i ever heard of

  oh well you can be swell without money comb
 our hair nice you know and get the girls to thipk
 ourc it and the ladies to speak sweet things about
 you and you are all right i know

 there was little danger that the ladies of cranford
 or anyone else would be likely to speak in very favor-
 able terms of bat arnold if he did not mend hisways
 and his disposition but bat did not think of that

 flint looked down upon the diamond that flush on
 his face and his black eyes snapping

 then he shoved a hand into his pocket

 when it came out it held a hundred dollars in green
 backs

 bat arnolds eyes rounded and he stared in amaze-
 ment

 he had never seen flint with so much money and
 felt sure he had not come by it honestly 

 the sight of those bills almost frightened him
 where did you get that he asked in awe

 flint counted out five ten-dollar bills and threw
 them to him

 what do you want me to do with them 

 theyre yours

 to keep

 yes to keep-perhaps

 whered you get em  thats what i want to know 
 oh dont look at em that way theyre not coun-
 terfeit 

 but where did you get em 

 flint took them again and held them alluringly in
 his hands

 how would you like to have this fifty dollars and
 fifty more on top of it 

 a covetous look came into bats eyes and he thrust
 out his roiyd bullet head significantly

 try me he said at length what you got up
 your sleeve 

 flint wadded the bills together

 i know of a feller wholl give that much and more
 to have jack lightfoot done up

 killed bat gasped 

 no of course not

 whats he want done
f

  io

  well if we thump the very old tar out of lightfoot
  the feller im speaking of will he satisfied
  uu this chap a man

  yes hes a man

  why dont he do it himself then 

  thats his business

  see here did somebody give you that money just
  to get you to whip jack lightfoot p

  he wants him more than whipped he wants him
  fsed op

  -	what for

  thats his business 

  bat rrnold loked incredulous

  ill bet i know who tlfat man is heaid finally 
  ill bet you dont

  its prof sanderson

  flint stuck his tongue in his cheek and winked
  go ahead with your guessin

  i know its sanderson

  would he take such a risk

  he dont like jack

  but would he take such a risk the people of
  cranford wouldnt stand for a thing like that

  if they didnt know ah come its sanderson
  nick flint winked again

  fits no difference to you is it who hands over the
  swag if you get if 

  bat arnold was silent again thinkingthis over

  he had discovered that prof sanderson of the
  cranford academy did not like jack lightfoot

yet it did not seem to him that sanderson would
be such a fool as to risk his position and hi popularity
by such an undertaking as nicholas flint had outlined

hammering that will simply half kill him

  so that- he wont be in shape to lead his athle
team this summer and beat the academy boya at b
ball  is that the ticket

  bat was still thinking that the man who wanted ti
done must be prof sanderson who would natural
not like to have jack lightfoot head a nine that wot
lay it over the nine from the academy

  im not giving this thing away said nick ftj
fve told you all you need to know

  why dfdnt you take the contract instead of ca
ing to me with it then youd had the wholfl ti
hundred

  flints apache face flushed again

  you knew you wasnt equal to the undertaking
guess

  think what you please said flint do you
into this thing with me or not ive told you all t
going to heres a hundred and you can have b
of it right now when jack is polished off in go
shape theres to be another hundred and you can ha
half of that

  bat arnold twiste uneasily on the grass plucki
onfe of the grass blades he set it between his tei
and chewed at it reflectively

  say he said suddenly is the feller that g
you that the one who kicked up that hullabaloo
lightfoots gym last night 

do you think sanderson would have done thattf
i hadn t thought so no but it came to me ti
maybe this millionaire thats throwin his money roi

you wont say its sanderson

 i wont confess who it is all ill say is that here -so free might be the feller that kicked up the racket
 is a hundred dollars and theres to be a hundred more the gym

hen jack lightfoot is t out of business for th  nicholas flint again stuck his tongue into his ch

                                                   and winked knowingly -

bat what you dont know will never hurt you

season

  for the season 
 t	 v	 

  what do you mean by that -

  that if you dont know too much youll not have
to tell too much if our game fls through and ye
get caught if anything happens im a regular know
nothing i never heard of any man nor ghost in the
gym never saw any money havent the slightest
knowledge of prof sanderson-dont kpow anything
i simply join the know nothings and keep my mouth
phut you might be leaky and thats why im not
going to tell you any more-than ive got to

  bat arnold did not like this plain speaking

  cant you trust me

  sure im trusting you when i stand ready to

                                                      

hand over this fifty dollars to you

  you ought to tell me the whole thing bat in-
listed

  i wont ill tell you this though i x felt sure
i could handle jack lightfoot alone i wouldnt have
tome to you im offering to divide with ysu to get
your help mights well be frank you know

  sat arnold rose to his feet as if angered then
thinking better of it or longing too much for that
pioney he dropped down again

  hows this going to be done he asked

  are you ready to go into it with me i want to
know that first

  maybe

 you havent any- cause to like jack lightfoot any
nore than i have hes done you mean just as he
as me he thinks hes away above you and looks
lown on you youre no better than the djrt under-his
eet to him	i

  he was appealing now to the baser feelings of the
oy he was trying to overpersuade

  he didnt treat me bad at the time of the tourna-
ienti said bat

  and another thing-you want th academy nine to
ln in the games that are being talked of for this
eason knock jack out so that he cant play and

cant lead his nine and your fellows of the academy
will have awalk-over

 oh we can beat those high-school scrubs any-
 how  bat boasted

 well youll see

 jack didnt do such-a-much in the baseball games
 last season

 he batted your fellows out of the box in-the next
 to the last game and in the last game he simply struck
 you out like one-two-three i was there and i
 saw it

 oh h cant do it again hes got a nine that will
 go to pieces all right all right

 nicholas flint began to lose his patience he stuck
 the money into his pocket

 all right he said if you dont want that hun-
 dred dollars j can find a fellow who does and if
 you say anything of what tve said to you about it
 why then you and i will mix and ill pound your face
 off

 bat arnold chewed hard on the grass blade and
 ignored this

 he wanted that hundred dollars

 you havent told me how this thing is to be done
 he reminded

 well ill tell you lightfoot and his friends are
 going on an outing into the woods down by simms
 hole well lay for him down there

 is that the only plan youve got 

 ive got some other things in my mind but im
 going out to simms hole first and take a look around
 before im ready to say what they are does that
 satisfy you 

 bat arnold did not answer at once

 the good and the bad in him were struggling for
 supremacy

 he wanted that money but he did not like the mean
 that were proposed to enable him to get it andworse

all-sports library
all-sports library

than that he did not want to do anything that might
get him into trouble with the officers of the law

  i feel sure of one thing he declared

  what is it

  for all that you wont say it ill bet prof san-
derson is back of this thing and that he knows all
about that monkey business in the gym last night
that was done to scare lightfoots crowd i dont see
what it amounts to though what does it accomplish
if they do get frightened by that

  nick flint again winked and thrust his tongue
knowingly into his cheek

  bat what you dont know will never hurt you he
said again

  and he would explain no further

  will you go into it he demanded finally

  ye-yes i think i will but ill tell you to-night

  you never had a chance to make a hundred dollars
so easy flint urged make up your mind quick
im going down to simms hole this afternoon and
when i get back i must have an answer if you dont
want the hundred dollars i know of a fellow wholl
be glad to finger it and do what i want done

chapter iv

a request

  one of the places in which jack lightfoot loved to
work and to study was the shed room at home

  it was back of the house and connected with it so
that it was a part of the building

  being warmed by a good stove in winter there jack
had his books his tools and workbench and some
gymnastic apparatus which he had used industriously
long before the gift of norwell strawn mde the upper
floor of the old carriage shop into a gymnasium

  here came tom lightfoot jacks cousin lafe
lampton and others of jacks friends to talk and
while away spare hours and to study or use the work-
bench and the tools

  jacksfriends found the shed room a pleasant pla
whether in summer or in winter and jack lightfc
pleasant company ad a stanch friend at all times

  lafe lampton chanced tp be in the shed room on t
particular afternoon talking with jack of the pract
work of the morning and of the mysterious happi
ings in the gymnasium the night before

  suddenly a man came round the neat white-pain
house having admitted himself into the yard by 
front gate and advancing to the door of the si
room knocked on it

  lafe got up and opened the door

  the man who stood there was a singular characl
known throughout the county as deaf peleg i
name was peleg brown

  he lived in a cabin not far from simms hole 
made his living such as it was by a little garden
and a good deal of hunting and fishing with oc
sional trapping in the fall and winter

  peleg stood hesitating in the doorway then ca
into the shed room

  no use to ask him what he wants said lafe
so deaf he couldnt hear thunder

  peleg walked straight across to the writing desk
the further end of the room where the window g
a good light and a bookshelf showed its volumes i
stooping over the desk began to frrite on some pa
he found there

  thus bent over and scribbling away he presente
queer figure

  though the day had been warm he was muffled
had on an overcoat a red woolen comforter roi
his neck and his cap pulled down over his ears

  he wore no more beard than an indian his sn
face had a cunning look something like that of a f
and his little eyes seemed to want to hide themselve
their deep sockets

                          

  in addition peleg was toothless and though
could not speak for he was dumb as well as deafj
all-sports library

unched his toothless jaws together as if he were
png to say something whenever he was communi-
ting with anyone either by signs or written words
having scribbled for some time at the writing desk
eleg came hack toward jack lightfoot workinghis
ws as he came and then thrust out the paper he had
ritten

both jack and lafe read it and it was a singular
id startling communication

here it is just as old peleg wrote it

twict i have seen a ghost at my house night
fore last he came ahd stud by my bed last night
ic come again i was by my pig pen feedin my
g and he come and stud by the corner of the pen

                              

jiminy crickets said lafe lampton

jack took the paper and wrote

ptell us more what did he look like

then peleg wrote

phe was tall hadnt any head nor any neck but
ent straight up like a stovepipe from his shoulders

	jiminy crickets said lafe

i again jack wrote

	what did he do

	nothing was the answer

if nice ghost said lafe commenting

jack wrote

ifdid you see him good and what do you want
p to do 

seen him all right wrote peleg and i want you
fcicome out and see him too to-night or soons you

do you believe in ghosts jack asked writing
le question

ii do hvin seen one you come out and take a
fck and if it is a man help me trap him

then he isnt sure that it is a ghost said lafe
me isnt as bfg a fool as he looks

peleg wrote other things but they did not add to the
jnre of information already furnished



 jack wrote once more

 were coming out to simms hole to camp and
 fish ill hurry the trip so that we can get to see
 your ghost

 then peleg departed and the boys sat down to talk
 it over

 im getting all balled up lafe acknowledged and
 he took out an apple and set his teeth in it as if fancy-
 ing that setting his jaws to working would help to
 limber up the machinery of his mind

 what do you think about it he asked not able
 to make any good- guess himself

 i dont know what to think

 is there any connection between the ghost peleg
 says he saw out there and the noise we heard in the
 gym last night 

 its queer that peleg came to me said jack or
 rather came to us here in this room why didnt he
 go to kennedy the constable 

 perhaps he did we didnt ask him about that

 i didnt think of it then but well find out if he
 went to kennedy 

 tf course this ghost business is all rot said lafe

 of course

 somebodys working a trick or it may be one
 person here and another out there at simms hole

 well watch the gym to-night said jack if
 we can get sight of the fellow who is cutting up per-
 haps well learn more but anyway weve planned to
 go to simms hole

 tom lightfoot came in and as the written state-
 ments of the queer deaf mute had been saved they
 were shown to him

 tom had not been at the gymnasium the preceding
 night but he had heard of the mysterious invader and
 the strange sounds made

 every person in cranford had heard these facts

 tom sniffed contemptuously

 i think this whole business at the gym and down
	all-sports library

at simms hole is just the work of kids who are
trying to have what theyd call fun

   tom said lafe speaking seriously you werent
at the gym last night the kid who made that racket
there must have been a mighty little fellow to have
got out past us without our seeing him or to have re-
mained in there without our discovering him
youd have seen him probably if he came out
tom admitted so its certain he stayed in there
there are a lot of old holes in and under those car-
riages and buggies

  we looked everywhere

  everywhere but in the right place why you
dont mean to claim that he was neither there nor
went away if he didnt get out past you where
could he have been but in the gym dont slip a cog
-and begin to talk silly

  yes it does sound silly lafe acknowledged
but i wish youd been there

  were going to watch for him to-night said
jack

   ill go with you tom volunteered

chapter v

a warning

  jack and tom lightfoot lafe lampton and nearly
every member of the athletic club of the high school
spent several hours that evening in watching the old
carriage shop

   they first ascertained that no one was in it or about
it and then hiding out in the darkness they tried
to make sure that no one came near it or that if anyone
came his identity should be made known

  tom lightfoot was a student at the academy and
on the nine that was expected to play against jack
lightfoots high-school team that summer

   nevertheless as jacks cousin and having a warm
regard not only for jack but for other members of
his team tom lightfoot was willing to assist in try-

                                      p

 ing to discover the ghost that was troubling th
 quiet of the high-school boys gymnasium

 the suggestion lightly made by some one that th
 academy fellows were at the bottom of it he repudiate
 rather warmly so that it was not brought up agai
 that night

 while the boys lay out in the gloom with ever
 sense on the alert there came a repetition of the sount
 heard the night before

whack bang blub-rub-bub whack bang

 tom lightfoot laid his hand on the shoulder of hi
 cousin jack as the two were lying close together

 there it is  said jack

 some one is in there now all right said torr
 starting up keep the place surrounded and well se

                      

 who it is and what hes doing

 the cordon of watchers guarded the carriage shop
 so that no one could leave it or approach it without dis
 covery while tom jack and lafe lampton enter
 the building lighted lamps and made a search

 this night they did not find everything upstairs i
 such perfect order the leaping pad had been turne
 over and the indiaif clubs were at the other side c
 the room from the place where they were usually kef

 no ghost here tom announced

 and nothing else said jack

 it seemed true

 no one could be found on the upper floor dov
 below or out on the shed roof and there were t
 other places to look

 tom lightfoot began to feel queer himself

 this rather gets me fellows he admitted

 we thought it would said lafe almost ma
 ciously yet i remember you said that f the fell
 didnt get out he was still in he hasnt got out a
 if hes still in id be glad to have you show me wh
 he is

 tom scratched his head as he went downstairs

 as they came out of the doorway there was an e
all-sports library	

clamation and a cry of excitement then ned skeen
cxclaimed
fweve got some one

 oh cut it out came in the voice of bat arnold
mi just carrre down here to see if you fellows had
idiscovered anything i heard uptown that you was
 watchin the gym to-night

i you didnt drop off the shed roof asked jack
i flashing a match and looking bat in the ace

i off the shed roof nixy i came right down
i ihis street and if your crowd hadnt been staring at
 the shop theyd have seen me

i a dozen boys stood ready ter declare that bat had
i cot dropped from the shed roof though his presence
bbere had somewhat surprised them for they had not
 heard his approach

 released bat went uptown and the watch was re-

f but nothing came of it

i the mystery was too deep for easy solution and the
boys went home at last baffled though some of them
jhungr round the carriage shop until nearly midnight

i jack lightfoot did not believe in late hours and
went home early yet he could not sleep because of
worrying over the mystery

i he wondered if it had any connection with the
itirigular message brought by the deaf mute

i well hurry up that outing to simms hole was
jis conclusion

i	as if his decision had brought it there was a crash
ht fcis window-the crash of a breaking pane-and
linmething fell with a thump on thefloor

 jack was out of bed instantly

f ile ran to the shattered window but saw no one

a 

 whidi was not strange for the night was cloudy nor
    did jhe hear the sound of footsteps

   trembling and startled he struck a match and
flighted his lamp

  he saw a small stone on the floor with a paper
 wrapped about it and tied there with a string

  that was the object that had come through the
 window

  on removing the string and the paper jack found
 a communication

  it had not been written but to conceal the identity
 of the- one sending it letters and words had been cut
 from newspapers and pasted together into sentences
 thus

  do not go to simms hole you will be in dan-
 ger take my advice and stay away sty
 away this is a warning i know what i
 am talking about stay away

  again jack went to the window and looked out

  who could have thrown this through the window
 and what danger can there be in going to simms
 hole was his thought

  he turned the paperover and looked at the back
 which was blank

  again he went to the window

  at first he was disposed to go downstairs and tell
 his mother what had happened

  no use to disturb her was his second thought
 in the morning will do as well

  he did not go to bed again for some time

  the shattered glass lay on the floor this he picked
 up carefully and to keep out the chill wind that came
 through the broken pane he stuffed some clothing in it

  think as he would he could come to but one con-
 clusion  arrd that connected the danger with the deaf
 mute



  peleg is a queer old duck and if this warning is
 anything more than a joke it must refer to something
 he is up to that ghost story of his may have been
 a lie

  of course jack lightfoot had never suspected that
 peleg brown had seen a ghost but he was willing to
 believe that the deaf mute had really beheld some-
all-sports library

 thing which his superstitious imagination had taken
 for such

 now he doubted even that and was almost disposed
 to think if the warning were not a practical joke that
 peleg was up to some mischief which the one sending
 the warning wished to caution him against

 why couldnt he have said what it was this
 tiling of throwing a stone through my window is
 sneaking of itself it broke the window and doesnt
 tell me anything more than that there is danger
 what kind of danger and from whom 

 jack went to bed pondering these questions and fell
 asleep before he had arrived at ally conclusion

            chapter vi

           in tee waods

in the good ojd suij-mer time

in the good old summer time

                  rambling down a shady lane
              with your baby ajjnel
              you hold her iwnd and-

 cut it out said lafitfcampton speaking to nat
 kimball the sweet warbler of simms plole as the
 hoys called him this-isnt summer time-its spring

 and we didnt think hed spring that on us i added
 ned skeen

 jack had disregarded the warning so strangely sent
 him and was at simms hole with his friends

 the day was glorious not a fleck of cloud in the
 azure sky a warm wind and the budding trees send-
 ing out woodsy odors

 simms hole lay to the westward of tkfe town of
 cranford two or three mils distant

 laurel river heading up in the hills flowed into the
 western end of cranford lake which was a somewhat
 oblong body of water set between a wild woodland on
 one sidtrlnd the level country containing the town
 of cranford and many fine farms on the other

 laurel river flowing into cranford lake and
 aialapan river flowing out of it at the other end

might have been considered in a sense as one stream
flowing from the timbered hills through the lake aa
on to the sea but they were two rivers to the cra
ford people and bore separate names

  malapan river emptying into the sea was a tid
channel

   laurel river emptying into the lake was fresh ar
was fed by some famous trout streams

  simms hole was a deep cavity in the bed of laur
river a few hundred yards above the upper end 
the lake

  all about simms hole lay heavy woodlands whi
in some places became a wild tangle

  just above simms hole and really hanging or
it or rather projecting into it was an old dam

  this dam was much broken in places it stood c
and over these places the water tumbled with a ro
and a beautiful waterfall effect

  in the broken places there were here and there pr
jecting sticks of timber that thrust themselves upwa
and whipped at the water like saws

  swinging back and forth they sometimes thre t
water into spurting jets which glistened brightly
the sunlight

  at one end of the dam and built out upon it w
a tumble-down cabin almost in ruins now

  peleg brown the deaf-mute had lived there a lc
time and had put up the cabin in that queer pla
that he might be right at the fishing ground he lovi
without havingto take the trouble even to walk to

  peleg s present home lay further up the stream

  he had abandoned the old cabin that hung a
swayed at one end of the dam because of a flo
which came suddenly one night and rising into 
cabin gave him the fright of his life

 peleg when that water rose threatening to w
him from his bed climbed out on the cabin roof a
there some people passing in the morning discovei
all-sports library	

im sitting astride the ridge pole making signs and
working his toothless jaws

peleg bad been on that roof for hours unable to
sound and expecting every minute that the

     oukl be carried away

    k no chances with the treacherous spring

     f laurel rives after fhat

     lie old cabin made a famous place for the boys
     e to catnp at simms hole and often fhey sat
     oorway or hung out of its window with their
     lines whipping the river below in the hole
     better spot than the vicinity of simms hole
     have been chosen for a boys camp and here
     spring came fishing and camping parties from
     vn of cranford and from other points more re-

    lightfoot and his friends had brought up a
                   -  

     nt and a complete camping outfit with cooking
     s and a supply of food

     the tent stood deserted some of the boys jack
     of the number had not even slept in it the
     us night but had lain out under the trees with
     ering but their blankets for the ground was

       ry-

    lampton was the self-appointed cook of the
    not because he liked so much to cook but be-
    lie liked to keep close to the eatables and while
    ig he could satisfy his palate by tasting the vari-
    shes he was preparing

     king was really the only work tfcat lafe lamp-
     loroughly enjoyed and he could hardly under-
     why all the other boys had not clamored for

       sition

     was now stirring something in an iron pot that
     d hung on a tripod over a fire out of doors
     e blue smoke drifting up through the yet leafless
     hes toward the bluer sky and lafe stirring and
     and then tasting made a picture of contentment

 with the other boys standing or lying about in various
 attitudes of lazy enjoyment

 this was the situation when nat kimball carried
 iway by the spirit of coming summer began-to pipe
 out that old chestnut the good old summer time

 hit him with a brick if he tries to sing it again
 grunted bob brewster who would never have heaved
 a brick at anyone except under the severest provoca-
 tion

 oh say im too lazy for anything  declared tom
 lightfoot who because he was jacks cousin was
 there thoiigh he belonged with the academy crowd

 but then tom was a royal good fellow who was
 welcomed anywhere

 ned skeen began to sing

                oh the spring is a finer time
                than the good old summer time

lying in the shady woods-

 oh you dont need to be in the woods to enable
 you to do that nat kimball declared

 skeen looked at him reproachfully

 isnt a fellow to be allowed to sing anything

 not when he doesnt know how

haw hw laughed jube marlin the wide-
mouthed yankee

 stepping back to avoid the kick which skeen de-
 livered as a jocular return nat kimball sat down sud
 denly and in trying to save himself from the fall
 plowed his fingers into the soft earth

 now kimball has got germs chirged arlo kil-
 foyle he always finds germs whenever he puts his
 hands on the ground

 well if i do believe irt germs i dont believe in
 ghosts nat retorted youd better go away back
 and sit down a fellow thats queer enough to be-
 lieve in ghosts shouldnt try to poke fun at anybody
 else

 i dont know that there are any ghosts and i dont
 know that there arent said kilfoyle but you ex-
                            all-sports library
plain that business at the gym will you you cant of insect life but the ants predominated they

do it

oh gee heres a nasty worm crawling over me
  cried kimball knocking it away with a look of disgust
  tom lightfoot began to sing 

light is the breeze in the treetops astir

fragrant the breath of the hemlock and fir

bright is the sky as the eyes that we love

sweeter the brook song than note of the dove

                   deep in the wpods

                   deep in the woods

  ned skeen who had bee called down for his ping-
  ing yet fancied he could sing and had a real gift for
  hasty parody cut in

   kilfoyle sees spirits ajjd kimball fjnds germs

   when there are no germs he is fighting with worms

   he bats them and cuffs them and oh how he squirms
                  deep in the woods

                   deep in the woods

  cut it out kimball commanded sharply

  tom lightfoot continued

 

       bowers of beauty and vista so fair

       far far behind us each sorrow and care i
       lighter our thoughts than the branches that swins
       joyous our hearts as the birds on the wing

                   deep in the woods

                   deep in the woods

  again ned skeen brdke in like a musical sea gull
some of the fellows claimed

        catching fresh colds that will make us all sneeze

       bored by mosquitoes and bitten by fleas

       snakes for our playmates and ants for our fare-

       tell oh tell me who wouldnt he there

                     deep in the woods

                   deep in the wbbds

  fellows there are fleas here or ants or something
and a lot of them said kimball jumping up and be-
ginning to scratch his legs

  pshavv those axe just germs you got them off the
ground declared kilfoyle

  youll see a ghost or something if i punch your
head

  jack lightfoot began to squirm he had been lying
at his ease under one of the trees enjoying the jok-
ing and the quick repartee now he too got up

the warm sunshine was bringing out various forms

  the big black hungry variety with jaws like
  jack brushed away the ants that troublt
  found a new seat while the boys began to til
  insect life of the woods

   jifn bright whose qne great ambition
  come an actor leaped to his feef and stretc
  hands with a stagy air

   he declaimed this then started on sometl

  footsteps were heard behind him and thera

  lie had some fish which he delivered to jack
  foot as a present for the boys and then took ou
  

  of paper

  jack read aloud the words written on it by

chapter vii

along the streams

  whipping the trout streams that made down from
the hills into laurel river furnished some of the finest
sport the boys could desire

  to throw the fly out on the surface of the whirling
water and let it drift down taking care to keep even
youi shadow from being seen by the wary fish that lie
under the edge of some rock or in a dark hole is no
easy accomplishment

  to throw arftl throw again to wade and creep to
quiver with expectation and then in almost an unex-
pected mpment to have the trout rise to the fly

  after that the singing  the reel and the careful
work

  ho there careful careful hell break your tackle
or get away careful

  to see the beautiful fish throw himself in a shining
leap clear out of the water to feel the pull and tug
to reel in and then to have him go plunging with the
reel singing again

  is there anything finer in the way of sport for either
man or boy 

  there may be yet it is doubtful

  the cool wind of spring blowing in your face the
tang of spring in the air the spirit of spring throbbing
and leaping in your veins swelling your heart the
song of the racing brook in your ears and the song of-
the breeze in the trees above your head while the sun
shines brightly and the air is filled with a thousand
odors and a thousand signs of new and budding life

  all this is yours while you play the gamy trout
and your reel sings

  now you work him in nearer to the shore he is
well exhausted by this tine but still game and he de-
serves well of you for he made a fine even a glorious
fight

he comes in sulking perhaps or with a fresh acces-

all-sports library
 

sion of courage and strength he strikes again for the
black shadows in the stream or in the pool

 then when at last you have him near the shore you
must still use your utmost skill

  the landing net now and more careful work then
you lift him out of his element and he is yours

  with such pleasure as this jack lightfoot and his
boy comrades failed to remember the ghost that had
troubled thegym forgot all about the ghost seen
more than once by old peleg and neglected or disre-
garded the warning message that hadcome crashing
through jack lightfoots chamber window at home

  but at night when they came in tired yet glowing
with innumerable stories to tell of the fish thy didnt
get of the many trout that got away bigger far
bigger than the ones caught and they sat down be-
fore the tent in the gathering darkness to sample the
fish done to a turn by lafe lampton the talk turned
frequently to the mystery of the gym and to the ghost
that had stood in the door of pelegs old cabin and
had walked the broken dam before that door

   apparently this ghost knew that a party of skeptical
rollicking young rovers was camped near the shore at
simms hole and were so lacking in a proper spirit
of reverence that they would not have hesitated to
take the said ghost by the collar presuming that he
wore one and chuck him into the water just to serve
him right for night walking

  so the ghost kept away

   but the fun and the sport were fast and furious yet
of a perfectly harmless and jovial kind the sort of
fun that never yet injured any boy or made him less
manly when he became a man

  peleg came in the second evening to ask by means
of signs if the ghost had walked as yet

  receiving an answer in the negative he drew out
his writing pad and a pencil and began to write

  usually when peleg did that something interest-
ing might be expected

	a

  this was what he wrote on the evening in questions
in simms hole lives the hermit trout i hookej
hirribnce but he broke my pole and my line and gon
away from me and nigh about drowned me maybj
you catch him i never could except that one time ant
then i didnt land him

   jack read this aloud to the boys while peleg looke
on smiling and working his hairless toothless jaws

  he was still dressed as if he expected an early re
turn of winter with a big coat on and that com-
forter round his thin neck but he had discarded hi
woolen mittens and no longer pulled his cap dowi
over his ears

   jack witite

   where had a fellow better fish to get him 

  peleg answered

  right before the cabin door right out in front
he hangs round under the log of the old dam an
onct i seen him rise there and snap a fly offn th
water when the fly dropped down on the water h
was a whopper-nigh about big as a sturgeon 
thought hes been there ten year i guess and if
you git him you git a whale

  thats a whale of a lie said ned skeen when
this was read

   all right well try for him jack wrote

  and peleg when he had read this worked his hair
less jaws again and smiled

  jack wrote many questions on pelegs pad that even
ing some of them about the ghost and peleg an
swered to the best of his ability

  he never saw any ghost there and he never hookec
any such trout skeen persisted hes stringing us
ands been stringing us from the first

begorra ill take his string to-morry and thrj
mesilf fer that fish said jerry who still lingered
unable to leave the joys of the camp at simms hole
take his string oh yes the string hes string
ing us withl wowl jerry ill duck you in the hol

prtunity to catch that whale with your hands
wry grinned

fchat first chance i get and that will give you an the camp had been aroused by lamptons exclama-
tion

   the ghost said jack whatever it was man
he might dhrowned me av hes as big as pelig r spirit went into that cabin come on and well

if 		find it

he did not stop to dress but with his blanket drawn
about him ran toward the dam and the cabin which
were but a few yards away

the other boys followed hot at his heels clad in the
same way and with them came jerry who had been
the one to discover the ghost

but when the dam and the cabin were gained they

 ore than one of the boys believed that peleg was
 nging them both about the fish and- with regard
 le ghost

 ey paid so little attention to his stories of the

 n that they went to sleep that night as usual

 in their blankets undr the trees and were deep

 land of dreams whea jerry himself awake sud-

 j	i	could find nothing

an phat the divvil is

 aroused them
 fhoosh he whispered
 low i wanty know 
 hand touched jack lightfoot
 c aroused on the instant lifted his head

  moonlight had come again after many nights
 lrkness and it glanced whitely across simms
 and lighted up the old cabin and the broken dam
 the dam near the cabn sitting as if looking
 into the stream holding a fishing pole too was
 mge tall figure clad in something that looked
 st white in the moonbeams

a search of the interior resulted in the same way

apparently no man had been in the cabin or on
the dam no fishing pole could be found no wet
tracks-nothing

jack lightfoot and his companions were puzzled

    niver a ghost was that said jerry decidedly as
he hunted through the cabin

    what became of him then kilfoyle asked

    he made a shneak into the woods do ye see he
could ave done ut he could have jomped aff the dam
here and scooted into the thimber and the bushes
would soon hicie him im bettin me owld hat ut was

    shwearin thats the ghost though i niver seen that way

efure whispered jerry

  rolled over and touched tom and lafe whis-
their names to arouse them
fe threw up his hands with an exclamation that
sd very loud in that deep stillness
jarently it reached the strange form sitting on
ken dam for the figure rose up suddenly stand-
trhen erect to an enormous height and straight as
vepipe from waist to head as peleg hfed re-
lit thus stood up it seemed to slip without mo-
to melt as it were into the very walls of the
then it was gone without a sound

  it was the best theory that could be conjured up yet
not entirely satisfying and jack and the others re-
turned to the camp and to their blankets to lie awake
a long time thinking it over

chapter viii

the attack

  the next morning when jack awoke he saw nich-
olas flint sitting on the dam while bat arnold was
just coming out of the woods

  hello jack called rolling out of his blankets and
in so doing and in calling out that way waking the
other members of the camping party


 but the sun was rising arid the time had come for
 them to arise so jack did not mind that

 nick flint did not appear to notice jacks civil
 salute

 hes no good lafe grunted when he saw flint
 whats he doing up here while were in camp we
 dont want him

 perhaps he doesnt want us remarked jack easily
 he seems to have been first on the dam this morn
 ing

 having dressed -he walked out to the dam

 hello flintim he said again then added you
 didnt see anything of a ghost round here early this

 morning

 i havent lost any ghosts flint answered surlily

 but were hunting one he was sitting last night
 fight where you are sitting now and he seemed to
 slide into the door - there we couldnt find him
 though we came over and looked around

 huh flint grunted skeptically

 bat arnold came up smoking a cigarette

 mornin he growled

 he did not look at jack but kept the visor of his
 cap pulled down over his eyes

 the fishing is great said jack weve-been up
 and down all of the creeks and the trout are biting
 fine perhaps yodd like to sample some that weve
 caught well have them for breakfast in a ljttle
 while

 but neither bat nor nick seemed to care to accept
 this hospitable invitation

 they acted as if they had something on their minds
 something disagreeable or unpleasant which was trou-
 bling them

 jack noticed this and wondered what it was

 he bad no great respect for either of the boys nor
 fisy-e for their company but he always tried to treat
 everyone civilly just as he would like to be treated
 himself

all-sports library

  that was one reason why jack lightfoot had such
a host of friends

  though he was so far above these two boys in mani
ways he hadno feeling of superiority

  apparently they had come out to simms hole fey
a good time as he and his friends had and he vva
willing that -they should enjoy themselves to the ut
most

  finding that neither nick nor bat were in a talka
tive mood jack gave over his efforts in that line anc
returned to the camp

  what are those fellowsping here lafe asked
  i couldnt find out fishing i presume

  i wish theyd stayed away theyll make trouble
sul messenger thrust forward his shock of yellov
hair and his pugilistic jaw

 let em try it		 

  jack lightfoot was forced to laugh

  saul i dont know whether you like to fight as wel
as lafesdoes to eat though i rather think you do
but there is nothing to fight- about yet

  just let em try to make trouble for us said saul
clinching his fists ive been longing for a chance t-
hammer in the face of that low-down nigger nic
flint

  that indian you mean said lafe

  indian or nigger it dont make much difference t
me when i get through with him he wont know ths
hs got a face

  sauls attitude was so much that of the eager pugilis
that jack laughed again and sitting down with penc
and paper he drew a earicature of saul messenger i
the act of reducing nick flint to something tha
looked like a bag of jelly

  thats what id like to do to him said sau
trying to grin when he saw the picture and it
what i will do- if he goes to making trouble roun
here
all-sports library

fc fhnt nd bat arnld  while the rn going to tty for that hermit trout  said

jack if a fllow could hook him

 j-jvere eating breakfast

 was a fine breakfast too showing that lfe hed pull you intothe hole said nat kimball
 pton was well up in the culinary art	id risk it if i could once get my hook in his

 td like to know where you learned to fry fish so mouth thered be a pretty fight anyhow if i didnt
 u taid ned skeen howling mackerels this land him

-	though jackjneant to try for the hermit trout which

 not a howling mackerel nop any other kind  thats peleg said inhabited simms hole he desired first to
 out dont disgrace it by calling it a mackerel whip a certain section of one of the creeks of the neigh-
 jiied skeens mouth was filled with fish but he con- borhood where the year before he had had good luck
 red to ask again how lafe had learned the trick of he set out for this point after breakfast going

 alone as most of the other boys had plans of their own
 for the morning which would scatter them to various
 places

ig them to such a turn

trom my mother sard lafe shes a good

r

you take after her naturally jack remarked

as jack walked along he chancd to see bat arnold

til take after yop said lafe witi a lauglr if moving in the woods before him it

was just a

 fcnt praise that fish as you ought to its this
 p i always liked to eat you know i

 h yes we know that i

 so i used to hang round the kitchen a good deal
 you used to  oh thats good

 well i do still of course and so watching her
 helping her now and then when shed let me i
 iheihang of cooking a good many things and i
 her like to cook

   ause you can eat while youre cooking
   e

 dition to the fish there was bread which jerry
 ought from the town crackers canned goods of
 is kinds principally canned fruits together with
 eggs condensed milk canned vegetables and
 things though all of these were not served for
 ast of course

 e boys were living well and they were besides
 lg the time of their live

 ck flint and bat arnold who had refused to par-
 e of that bountiful breakfast were practically for-
 lten- while the boys ate laughed and joked and
 qned for the fishing trips of the day

 glimpse he caught but it set him to thinking

   i wonder what those fellows are doing up here
 maybe theyre making for the same point i am and
 intend to fish there

   jle hurried on

   reaching the creek and seeing no one he began to
 whip the stream carefully selecting his flies and using
 all the skill of which he was master

  he had landed one speckled beauty and was so
 deeply immersed in the sport that he had again forgot-
 ten about bat and nick and the warning which had
 teen so strangely thrown into his room

   then a club whirled from a low tree over his head
 struck him a blow on the shoulder and at the-same
 time a iorm dropped out of the branches

   the club had been so aimed that if jack had not
 shifted his position just at the instant it was thrown
 it would have struck him full on the head and the
 form that shot downward must have struck him also

   but hitting him on the shoulder the injury was not
 so great though the blow washeavy enough to deaden
 and numb the arm

   jack recovered dropped his rod and turned just in
	all-sports library

 time to see a disguised and masked figure spring at
 him striking again with a club

 jack avoided this blow by springing backward and
 in so doing put his back against a rock

 he saw now that he had two masked enemies to
 meet and having seen bat in the woods he at once
 jumped to the conclusion that they were bat arnold
 and nicholas flint

 his left arm and shoulder struck by the club pained
 and numbed by the blow were almost useless

 neither of his assailants uttered a word as they
 rushed upon him

 i know you nick said jack judging that nick
 was the one who had hit him put down that club

 instead of putting it down nick struck with it

 with a quick jump jack hit the club with his foot
 and sent it spinning into the creek wrenching and
 stinging the hand that had held it	

 believing that the two of them were more than
 enough to do up jack lightfoot the boys rushed
 in again

 the dastardly character of this unprovoked attack
 fired jacks heart and filled him with almost an un-
 governable rage

 jack had a hot temper which he had exhibited on
 more than one occasion but which he tried to hold
 in check

 it burned to a fury now and made him reckless and
 implacable and when jack lightfoot was thus
 aroused he had the quickness and the fighting power
 of a tiger

 he set his back against the rock as they rushed in

 though his temper was boiling his brain was clear
 his face was pale and his gray-blue eyes were shining
 and wide open

 crack

 bat arnold received a stinging blow in the face that
 sent him reeling

 hampered by his injured left arm jack could not

 swing again with his right in time to smash his
 into the face of nick flint he only struck flint
 the arm

 the next moment he and flint grappled and fell t
 the ground together

 with his jaw feeling as if it had been broken ba
 had stumbled backward and fallen into the watei 

 help here yelled flint thus revealing his identitj
 by his voice

 jack lightfoot had him by the throat

 bat staggered up dripping with water and rushcc
 to the aid of his friend

 jack tripped him withhis foot as he came on am
 bart fell on top of the struggling boys

 in the wild struggle that ensued nick flint releasa
 himself and then mistaking bat for jack lightfooi
 he began to hammer him in the face

 bat yelled for all he was worth

 before nick understood what he was doing jac
 lightfoot had writhed out of his grasp and sprun
 to his feet

 nick and bat rolled apart

                                                                                    

 nick now whipped out a knife

 seeing that in his possession jack again backe
 against the rock

 the numbness and pain were going out of his it
 jured arm even if that had not been go jack ligh
 foot would have forgotten the injury now or ignore
 it

 both of his assailants rushed at him again nic
 with the knife cursing furiously

 in the scuffle on the ground nicks hat and ma
 had fallen off and his dark apache face was now r
 vealed

 bat still had his mask on but that hammering ha
 twisted it awry revealing a bruised and swollen chee
 where nicks hammering fist had done its work

 come on jack yelled wild and defiant con
 on you cowards-you sneaks  come on


all-sports library	

they were accepting the invitation

jack dodged to avoid the knife and feinting drove
s strong right fist into nicks face

he struck at bat with his other fist almost at the
me time but the blow wasot so effective and bat
ided one that jarred jacks head and made it sing
the knife was knocked from nickshand by his fall
d while he was trying to recover it jack threw his
t arm about bat arnolds neck and plunged his
ong right fist into his face

it was a bad-looking countenance after that bat
wled jack struck again in his rage bat fell
lply and jack released him just as nick rushed in
ain

you murdering coward ill settle you jack
eaed

he drove a terrific blow at nick and received a
list from the knife that ripped the sleeve of his coat
in struck again and this time with a force so ef-
tive that both knife and boy went into the creek
bat was trying to get up

jack jumped at him with his foot lifted tp deliver
cick

dont dont bat groaned youve killed me
iv dont

nick flint was thrashing the water with his hands
lack again backed against the rock and stood ready
his enemies

at crept to his feet groaning one of his eyes
s closed

ick flounced and flailed at the water

hes drowning said bat with a hoarse cry

ant you see

ack was still furious

help him out then he shouted

but i-i cant you put him there
t was true

lack looked at arnold his brain was clearing that

terrific fit of passion which had made him so tigerish
and so furious in the fight was passing

 he saw that nick flint seemed to be growing
weaker and was in no condition to aid himself

  you wont jump at me he asked of bat

  bat with hi hands to hi face groaned as a reply

  jack passed him with a quick leap and springing
 into the stream caught nick flint by the arm and
 literally pulled him out of the creek

  nick was gasping and strangling and seemed but
 half conscious

  a feeling of remorse mingled with something al-
 most like fear swept over jack the thought that he
 might have killed nick came to startle him

  seeing that bat was not likely to renew the attack
 he bent over flint now and began some effort to re-
 store him

  nick was a hardy youngster who was not likely to
 give up easily and he soon came out of his confused
 state which would have brought his death no doubt
 if he had remained in the water

  he looked almost shamefaced when he saw that
 it was jack lightfoot who was aiding him

  bat with his mask awry his clothing rumpled and
 torn sfcod by the rock one eye swollen shut and his
 features badly battered

  bat had had enough and to spare

  just then there was a crashing in the underbrush

  saul messenger the fighting man of the fishing
 crowd came upon the scene

  he had seen something of that furious struggle
 from a distance and to his great regret had been too
 far away to take part in it

  just let me at em he panted

  no said jack

  dont-dont let him hit me bat begged pite
 ousfy

  stand back jack commanded speaking sharply
 to saul
	all-sports library

  it was a picture for an artist jack lightfoot strong
 slender his handsome face pale but unmarred his
 gray-blue eyes flashing as he waved back saul mes-
 senger with that commanding gesture

  saul himself rushing forward with fists clinched
hat off his yellow hair tousled over his head like a
shock of wheat his sturdy pugilistic jaw thrust out

  bat arnold-bullet-headed bat-limping away to
escape sauls rush his coat tdrcl his disarranged mask
hanging over one ear one eye closed and his face
bruised and bloody

  and on the ground his clothing soaked his hat
gone his indian-like visage scratched and pummeled
nck flint of the- murderous heart and the apache
temper

  then there was th trout stream fringed by trees
the open path through the woods andthe murmuring
purling brookwith a fish line and fod on the ground
and a small trout beside them

  stand back jack commanded with imperious
gesture

  fighting saul fell back before that stern order and
the fire of those eyes

  theyre in no condition to fight said jack

  and youll let them go scot-free  saul protested

  yes they may go now for all i care and the
sooner they get out the better i shall be pleased

taking the hermit trout

  jack lightfoot stood on the rim of the broken dam
by the cabin flinging his trout fly out into simms
hole

  he had been doing that for more than an hour try-
ing different -flies

  the fellys wantin a gold bug said jerry
common throut- flies made out av feathers all the
oike aint good enough for um

 silently jack tried another fly and cast again

 the boy of the camp were in various places e
 gaged in various things

 in the cabin door almost behind jack stood la
 lampton and bob brewster

with them was orsan x who had appeared
the camp duringthe day wearing something of m
tery and nervousness in his manner

 the stqry orson had heard of the attack on jac
 and the manner in which jack had haid out his s
 sailants had caused orson to assurhe a still more si
 gular aii

 it was known that orson followed often in the tr
 of nick flint and the boys accounted or his que
 manner in that way yet orson had not said a word-
 defense of nick and bat

 as for those thoroughly whipped youngsters th
 had headed for town as soon as they were in a co
 dition to travel

 ill try the old hermit with a silver fly this tim
 said jack smiling as he prepared to try yet aga
 heres a silver one with black spots making it lo
 like a spotted butterfly

 ut will have to be a gold wan or- a diamond war
 jerry insisted so cheap a thing as silver cai
 timpt a delicate crayter loike that hes so shy
 must be irish thry him wid a grane wan

 were making too much noise said jack

 he stepped back to get his shadow off the wat
 and tried other flies

 a plump butterfly one of the earliest of the seasc
 came batting by and flopping into the hole

 instantly there was a swirl of the water a monsl
 trout rose and the butterfly was gone

 by the cove av cork did yees see that ut w
 him he was big as an ellyphant said jerry in
 hoarse whisper

 peleg said as big as a whale

 he wuz that begorra oh the iligant cravthe

jjes wantin real mate no bugs made out av
jpgs and the loikes fer him

heres another one of those butterflies criedtned
snd he took after the mate of the first with

returned with it in a little while having knocked

fawn and killed it

feck set it on his hook and with a flirt sent it out
jthe hole

tie butterfly settled on the water and with wings
floated along while jack moving his pole
y fried to give it a simulation of fife as if it
estrugg ing to rise from the water

he grants his mate alive whispered jerry oh
peticklar crayther he dont want anny butther
thats been knocked on the head an kilt bedad h

i	did seem so

ark moved his rod and the butterfly apparently
bing seemed on the point of lifting itself from

ben there was a swirl of the water as a shadow
led to dart from under the dam this was followed
flash i ng leap-then the line straightened
lere was a sudden splash a flash of silver in the
kid a shout from lafe for jack lightfoot had
dly hooked the foxy old trout of theswimming

ie feel sang

rn- threw his hat into the air and yelled

born yeve got him can yees howld him
ie hooked trout went to the bottom of the hole
seemed determined to make wildly for the lake-
sk paid the line out and when it eased he began
in

lain the trout struck out for a healthier climate
nee more the speeding line made the reel hum
ook out er hell br-reak yer line hell shnap yer
ftke a broom sthraw 

	was well aware of that

    he knew that skill alone could land that big trout
 feeling the wrench ofthe hook it threw itself out
 of the water in a clear leap that showed its big body
 and superb markings

    howly shmoke did yees see urn

   the trout having made that leap was coming up-
 stream

    the reel spun under jacks fingers as he took in the
 line

   under the edge of the dam the trout darted then
 stopped and lay there

    hes home an he knows it an he wont come out

    jack brought him out by a lift of the rod  and again-
 the startled trout headed downstream

   jack was playing the big fish with consummate
 skill having a care all the time for the security of his
 line and rod

    when he could he tightened the line in an effort to
 tire and discourage therout when he could do noth
 ing else he let the reel sing yet with enough pressure
 to give the line a continuous pull

    again the great fish threw himself out of the water
 in a skipping jump and again jerry and the other
 boys roared

  peleg brown came up on the shore and fairly
 danced clapping his hands when he saw the fight that
 was on

 for years he had tried to lure that trou to his hook
 and once he had succeeded only to let him get away
 again

 howled um  jerry cped

 jack was holding him he was doing more he
 was tiring the big fish

 up and down from end to end and side to side of
 the hole the trout rushed feeling the pull of the hook
 constantly he threw himself from the water in great
 leaps and sinking to the bottom sulked

 then when forced to start again he repeated the
 same tactics over and over

 the fight was on the slender rod and compara- saul messenger rushed to skeens assistance
 tively weak line and the skill of a boy were matched play hjim easy he said putting out his hand

against the strength of the big fish	tak hold of the rod play him easy or he ii br

but the skill of the boy was telling	your pole

 for more than half an hour the combat lasted then then both he and ned skeen stared as well

 when jack thought the trout was worn-out the strug-	howled for the thing that came to the surface was n

 gle started anew and continued for another fifteen	a fish-but a man

minutes until jack began to find that he was getting	-

pretty tired himself in spite ol fhe thrill and the ex-

                                            

citement

lafe grabbed the landing net as jack walking
along the dam toward the shore began io lead the ex-
hausted fish in that direction

where theres one trout theres always its mate
said ned skeen and he threshed his line into the pool
where the fish had been hooked

lafe thrust his landing net under the big trout
which jack drew to the shore

within the cabin looking from the door bob brew-
ster and orson oxx who had been hopping tip and
down in their excitement joined hands and began to

v	v

sing and dance with joy roaring out the words of a
fishing song

as they thus danced and roared they broke the half
rotten boards of the floor and bob brewster dropped
through with a yell

at the same instant there wa a terrific splash under
the edge ofthe dam

then there was another yell jtfis fime in the voice of
ned skeen

howling mackerels hte exclaimed ive got a
bigger one-

the rescue

 throwing the big trout well up on the shore wher
 it could not possibly get back into the hole jack lighj
 foot lafe lampton and jerry mulligan raced oi
 upon the broken dam to the assistance of ned skeer
 the boys in the cabin came out also followed bl
 bob who had dragged himself from the hole int
 which he had tumbled and who was not hurt by hi
 fall

 ned skeens hook had caught in the mans coat i
 the back between the shoulders and being a strong
 hook with a good line it was holding

 the man was threshing the water wildly with hi
 hands and seemed unable to swim

 when jack observed this he threw aside his coat
 kicked off his shoes and sprang into the hole

 jerry mulligan imitated him

 they came up by the man as he was rising once
 more to the surface

 skeens hook was still in the manscoat and skeefr
 in spite of his nervous and excited condition was st
 hanging to the rod
