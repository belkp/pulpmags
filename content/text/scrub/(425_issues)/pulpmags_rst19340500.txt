                             but i havent always
                             got a breath that
                             knocks people over

you can be careless about everything else in the
world but your breath-and get away with it but
halitosis bad breath is simply unpardonable
everyone is likely to have it at one time or
another since its primary cause is the fermenta-
tion of tiny food particles in the mouth the
insidious thing about halitosis is that you your-
self never know when it is present and even your
best friends wont tell you

the quick pleasant way to treat your breath so
that it wont offend others is to rinse the mouth
with listerine immediately the oral cavity feels
clean and fresh the breath becomes pleasant
and agreeable

 use listerine every morning and night and
between times before meeting others listerine
deodorizes hours longer than ordinary mouth

the hoghead who became
dictator of honduras

by earle davis

lenty of american rail-
road engineers have had
thrilling lives but no
american hoghead has
had a more spectacular
career than lee christmas who be-
came a soldier of fortune because he
could not tell a red switch light from a
green one

  lee was born in livingston parish
louisiana in  the son of a mexi-
can war veteran at the age
of nineteen he got a job firing
banana trains out of new or-
leans on the old yazoo 
mississippi valley railway
now the new orleans di-

vision of the illinois central in due
time he was promoted to engineer

  one day in  he ran past a red
light and crashed into the rear end of
another train fortunately it- was not
a serious accident but it called for an
investigation and an eye test christ-
mas was proud of his eyesight he had
often hunted ducks in the marshes and
was an expert marksman so he was
surprised to hear the oculist say

   your eyes are a bit as-
tigmatic

   thanks doc lee christ-
mas adjusted his overall coat
and picked up his cap believ-
ing the exam was ended
he rigged up
a fortress on
wheels and garri-
soned it with sharp-
shooters

   wait a minute said the eye doc-
tor  you havent taken the color test
yet he gave the hoghead skeins of
red green and white silk  pick out
the various colors and tell me what
they are

  christmas failed in the test-failed
completely they took his name off the
engine service roster never again
could he run an engine on any railroad
in the united states

  that afternoon he drew his pay and
said good-by to the railroad in a daze
he wandered over to the window

 looked down three stories to the street
 below and thought of suicide but in-
 stead of jumping he lurched down the
 stairs and out into the street dis-
 consolately fingering the last pay he
 would ever draw from the illinois cen-
 tral he did not know where to go

   if lee christmas had been a drink-
 ing man he might have headed into the
 nearest saloon instead of wandering
 aimlessly around the wharves and final-
 ly boarding a banana boat the purser
 found him gazing dismally over the rail
 into the blue waters of the gulf of

 mexico shortly after they had left new
 orleans

 your ticket sir

 christmas came to himself with a
 jolt  what port is this tub bound
 for

  our first stop is puerto cortes
 the purser replied in a tone of offended
 dignity

  where the devil is that

  spanish honduras sir said the
 purser

  well thats just where im going
 the ex-engineer fished out his small

roll of bills and paid his fare  do they
have a railroad down there 

   yes sir but you wouldnt call it
much of a railroad the national rail-
road of honduras is only about sixty
miles long

   good said christmas then he
reflected that they probably had no
color test in honduras

  his mind was made up hed get a
job running engines on the honduras
pike and the illinois central  brass
hats  could go sit on a tack and hed
soon learn enough spanish to get by
the hoghead who became dictator of honduras 

he already knew some of the lingo
anyway

arriving in the tropics christ-
mas found there was a warm re-
ception for engineers from the states
especially those whod worked on the
big american systems apparently
theyd never heard of such a thing as
color-blindness besides they did not
run trains at night so there was no
chance of mistaking red lights for
green ones

  the honduras railroad was used
largely for the transport of fruit from
the plantations and bullion from the
mines it was millions of dollars in
debt originally planned as a trans-
continental line it was then operating
only between puerto cortes and
pimienta-a distance of fifty-nine
miles

  back in the cab where he belonged
lee christmas found life worth living
fiice more in no time at all he was
talking a passable spanish and there
were dark-eyed senoritas in the dance
halls to make him forget the girls he
had left behind a h o g h e a d-
niachinista-got more attention from
the female population of honduras
than anyone else except a general but
lee christmas decided hed like to be
an army officer too

  at that time honduras was in the
throes of a revolution policarpio
bonilla and manuel bonilla-who
were unrelated despite their last names
-were bitter rivals for the hand of a
certain wealthy young lady they were
also bitter rivals for political power

  policarpio held the presidency of the
banana republic-an office and income
which manuel coveted a few days
after the revolution started christmas
was asked by manuel to run a train-
load of rebel troops from pimienta to

puerto cortes government troops had
taken a strong position along the line
and the proposed trip was extremely
dangerous

  he cast a critical eye over the troop
train which was made up of a wood-
burning locomotive and a long string
of flat cars in front was a small cane-
seated coach occupied by the officers
who were resplendent in gold-braided
uniforms of bright hue in the cars
were crowded the rank and file a mot-
ley crew many barefooted but all
armed with high-powered rifles

  engineer christmas turned to
manuel bonilla

   look here senor bonilla he said
 i came here to run a railroad train
not to get mixed up in bloody warfare
i know damn well there are a lot of
federal soldiers stationed along this
line if you want me to run this en-
gine ill do it but not for love you
got to fix it up for me-savvy 

  manuel bonilla understood perfect-
ly being a politician he had no illu-
sions an agreement was soon
reached lee christmas climbed into
the cab a man on the rear end gave the
signal and he was off

  policarpios men had hastily erected
a barricade across the railroad track it
consisted of old boxes bags of sand
and anything else they could lay hands
on in the underbrush on both sides
of the right-of-way the federals lay in
ambush

  christmas saw the obstruction on the
track pulled the whistle cord and
opened the throttle as far as shed go

   heres where i make a run for it
he said grimly his blue eyes flashing
fire

  the pilot of his mogul plowed
through the barricade and kept
on going bullets splattered the side
of the cab and christmas was forced


railroad stories

to duck until he got  all-fired mad
as he expressed it

 all right he cried  if i have got
to make a target of myself give me a
gun to drop somebody else

he stopped the train with a jerk and
grabbed a weapon from one of the

native warriors being a crack shot he
placed a few bullets where they did the
most good the revolutionists took
heart and began firing also in short
time the federals were driven into a
gully where they surrendered

when the fighting ceased the
hoghead mopped his face with
an old bandana-a symbol of railroad-
ing which he had brought from the
states-and strolled back to the en-
gine he was a medium-sized man
with yellow hair and mustache wide
straight mouth broad shoulders and
tireless energy

  manuel bonilla was waiting for him

   well we licked em the rail-
roader grinned

  bonilla couldnt find words eloquent
enough to express his gratitude
magnificent glorious you are a
great inginiero i shall reward yoft
you shall be a captain in the army of
freedom

  that wasnt so bad christmas re-
flected back home in louisiana hed
been only a throttle jerker now he was
rising in the world he made up his
mind to stay in honduras a while
longer and see what else happened
from the way the natives were talking
christmas gathered they regarded a
hoghead as a construction engineer
capable of doing many things particu-
larly building or destroying bridges-
whichever the revolutionists wanted at
the moment

   viva americano cried the sol-
diers in chorus

  when the train reached puerto
cortes two hours later christmas was
promoted to the rank of colonel

   this is getting better and better
all the time he exulted  theres
nothing like a revolution to give a fel-
low a start in the world
the hoghead who became dictator of honduras 

this fortress is the old presidential palace at tegucigalpa as it looked in the days when

general christmas ruled honduras

  then and there lee christmas defi-
nitely cast his lot with the rebels ad-
venture suddenly loomed large on his
horizon it was  the power and the
glory -or else the firing squad well
it was worth a gamble

	around the railroad centered the suc-
cess or failure of the revolution and
christmas was not slow to make the
most of what had been thrown across
his path more than one battle was
fought for possession of the twin rib-
bons of steel it didnt take christmas
long to discover that fighting for a rail-
road was much more exciting than run-
ning an engine-which was saying a
lot for if there was one thing he liked
more than anything else christmas en-
joyed wheeling a train over the high
iron

  the ex-engineer from the states be-
came wild and reckless both in running
his mogul and in leading an attack

   if we can hold the railroad he
told the presidential aspirant  well
win this war

   do that exclaimed the exultant
manuel bonilla  and ill make you a
brigadier general

  christmas chuckled the stakes were
getting bigger and bigger maybe hed
own the whole blasted railroad before
he got through

he rigged up a fortress on wheels
-a flat car with thick sandbag
walls-and garrisoned it with expert
sharpshooters this he put out in front
of the engine highballing it back and
forth along the right-of-way at length
he had the railroads other five locomo-
tives bottled up at one end of the line
traffic on the iron road was brought
to a standstill the federal forces were
driven away

  this bold maneuver marked the
turning point of the revolution after
that the lukewarm populace flocked to
the standard of manuel bonilla the
presidents dwindling army was utter-
ly routed president policarpio bonilla
himself was captured prisoner and his
rival was inaugurated as president in
the white palace at tegucigalpa the
capital

  one of the first acts of the new ruler
was to confirm the appointment of lee
christmas as brigadier general in su-


railroad stories

preme command of the military forces
of honduras the capital was placed
under martial law and the hoghead
was also made chief of police of that
city thus he became the power behind
the throne the dictator of honduras
no other railroad man in history had
ever attained to such a position

  one night the dictator was passing
through an alley in the little town of
nueva armena honduras after in-
specting a batch of new recruits when
he was attacked by seven men armed
with knives christmas backed himself
against a wooden fence and faced his
assailants with a mauser pistol one
man threw a knife that pierced his hat
the mauser brought him down and the
other six fled

  the railroader was not bloodthirsty
when the ex-president was placed on
trial on a charge of  conspiracy
against the republic  general christ-
mas acted as both his jailer and his
judge the new president and his fel-
low-officials decided that the trial was
to be merely a farce and a firing squad
was ordered out to mete out ap-
propriate punishment to the luckless
policarpio

  the dictator intervened however
policarpios life was spared he was
sentenced to prison and later exiled to
salvador a neighboring republic

  the country of honduras over
which general christmas held sway
was slightly larger than the state of
pennsylvania with less than 
population the land was rich in unde-
veloped natural resources but was set-
tled in the mountainous and jungle
areas her capital tegucigalpa is
said to be one of the only two capitals
in the world which do not have railway
connections

  peace having been restored the job
of dictator and police chief became

rather boring to the american hog-
head even with a residential palace of
his own and the adoration of black-
haired spanish beauties he craved
fresh excitement

  word drifted in that trouble was
brewing in the south american coun-
try of venezuela and that president
castro could use a combined railroad
engineer and soldier of fortune to or-
ganize the government forces against
a possible revolution this looked like
lee christmass meat obtaining a
leave of absence he hurried over to
venezuela where he immediately was
created a general in castros army

  but the foes of honduras who had
only been waiting for general christ-
mas to leave broke out with fresh
trouble nicaragua declared war upon
the manuel bonilla administration
claiming that manuels predecessor had
given them rights over certain bordef
lands

the rail dictator hastened back to
tegucigalpa and took command
of an army of about  men but
arrived too late the nicaraguans
with the aid of honduran traitors
managed to win a decisive battle
president bonilla was forced to flee
while general christmas rallied his old
guard of two hundred men some of
them railroad boomers from the states
and made a determined stand in the
mountains

  for a while it looked as though the
christmas star were again in the as-
cendant but the enemy with thousands
of men overtook the old guard at
mani a two days march from the
capital undaunted general christ-
mas led his gallant two hundred in a
desperate sortie hoping to cut through
the hostile iron ring

  the trapped men put up a brave
the hoghead who became dictator of honduras 

fight sixty of them were killed and
more than one hundred including gen-
eral christmas were wounded the
rest were scattered even with a broken
shoulder blade the man from
louisiana was attempting to reload his
gun when he was captured and thrown
into the very dungeon to which he had
mercifully sent policarpio the ex-
president some time before zelaya
was inaugurated president in the white
palace

  that night christmas managed to
get word to one of his comrades guy
r moloney a tough scotch-irishman
who had fought by his side in more
than one revolutionary campaign but
this time it seemed that moloney could
do nothing to save him

  next morning as a blood-red -sun
shot up behind the palmetto trees fac-
ing his prison the deposed dictator of
honduras was led out to meet a firing
scjuad well it was all over now gen-
eral christmas decided but hed tell
those dogs what he really thought of
them before they put a slug of lead
through his heart

  instead of calmly uttering a roman-
tic farewell as was the custom christ-
mas burst into a torrent of abuse at his
captors spouting forth venomous in-
sults too vile to print when asked
where he wanted his body shipped
general christmas snarled

   i dont want my body buried i
want it to remain on top of the
ground

  the corporal in charge of the firing
squad gaped at him

   why you not want to be buried 
he asked

   because screamed the prisoner
wildly  i want the buzzards to eat me
and then scatter my remains all over
every one of you 

  infuriated the captors argued


railroad stories

among themselves as to a more suitable
way of putting the dictator to death-
something cruel such as gouging out
the eyes or peeling off the skin a little
bit at a time

  and while they were debating and
preparing certain instruments of tor-
ture moloney came to the rescue with
a party of manuel bonillas men who
had survived the carnage and whisked
general christmas away to safety

  this time christmas headed for
guatemala a tough journey through
the jungles while there the ex-dicta-
tor recuperated from his wounds and
went back to his old love-railroading

  meanwhile he kept a weather eye
on the changeable politics of honduras
his friend manuel bonilla had col-
lected several thousand dollars in gold
and had sent an emissary across the
gulf of mexico to new orleans to buy
rifles and gatling guns to blaze another
trail to the presidents chair the emis-
sary however once safely out of sight
found other uses for the money and
manuel was left holding an empty bag

then in  manuel amassed
some more gold this time he
entrusted it to general christmas who
sailed to new orleans and purchased
an old united states gunboat the
 hornet while in the crescent city
he was besieged by newspaper re-
porters clamoring for interviews

  but he was wise and he denied that
the  hornet  would take any muni-
tions to honduras for another upris-
ing the ship cleared suddenly for cape
gracias honduras and after being
safely escorted to the three-mile limit
by a united states revenue cutter
turned back and went to ship island
mississippi there bonilla christmas
florine davidi and guy moloney who
was a machine gun expert loaded on

arms ammunition and food supplies
and the long distance telephone from
that point mysteriously stopped work-
ing

  as soon as the united states offi-
cials learned what had happened they
promptly indicted those men for vio-
lation of the neutrality laws in equip-
ping a military expedition against a
friendly nation but the birds had
already flown the washington gov-
ernment thereupon ordered the battle-
ship  tacoma  to honduran waters
to watch the  hornet  and see that
she did not violate american neutrality

  this surveillance did not disturb the
wary engineer christmas gathered an
army in nicaragua and one night with-
out warning marched them across the
border simultaneously he assembled
off puerto cortes a smaller force in-
cluding a lot of boomers and foreign
soldiers of fortune and in a combined
attack led by moloneys machine gun
squad he captured the town in the face
of a storm of bullets

  once again manuel bonilla unseated
a president of honduras with the in-
trepid yankee resuming his former
role of dictator once more general
lee christmas enjoyed the luxury of a
palace and the beautiful belles of
tegucigalpa flocked around him it
was a boomers paradise if ever there
was one

 his biographer hermann b
deutsch writing on  the incredible
yanqui characterized lee christmas
as a roughneck and a bum whom he
described as a cave man with a ready
dribble of sentiment on tap for senti-
mental occasions devoted in his way
to the woman of the hour and utterly
indifferent to her when the hour was
past but he never failed in loyalty to
his male comrades he was married
three times
rhe hoghead who became dictator of honduras 

  christmas was the original of clay
the hero in richard harding daviss
popular novel  soldiers of fortune
he and the author were close friends
christmas was a general in the armies
of five latin american republics-
honduras nicaragua salvador
guatemala and venezuela-and was
instrumental in placing five presidents
in office by revolutions

  the son of a soldier warfare was
in his blood off and on he fought for
twenty years the challenge of his bad
luck back home on the illinois central
was the turning point in his life

  where chance led lee christmas
followed moving from one snap judg-
ment to another and taking what fate
sent his way seven times he was
wounded-thrice in one engagement
and four times in separate battles-and
escaped many attempts at assassination
or execution on several occasions he
was reported as having died with his
toots on in fact the rumor was
spread so often that it became a stand-
ing joke in newspaper offices and edi-
tors printed the headline  christmas
dead again

as a measure of self protection gen-
l eral christmas occasionally re-
tained a gunman as his personal body-
guard one of these fellows a boomer
named edgar smith wrote this de-
scription of his employer for the new
york herald tribune magazine

   before me stood a medium-sized
man dressed in an ordinary suit of
clothes with a flopping white hat on
his head that was pinched to a sharp
crease on top his hair at the temples
was snow white his face was brown
and seamed his mouth was wide but
the lips were compressed and his nose
was not what one expected of such a
man one expected the curved beak

of a bird of prey but his was not

   his eyes were a dim blue the
pupils appeared to stare out from the
entire eyeball keen black spots very
piercing i confronted a man in whom
all human feeling was dead

   smiling he thrust out his right
hand and gripped mine with a steely
claw later i learned the reason for
this tremendous grip the other arm
although it appeared natural had been
riddled with bullets and was almost
useless so that all the strength was in
one arm

  edgar smith first met the dictator at
a hotel in guatemala city after a
brief conversation christmas said

   you are just the man i want ive
been shot treacherously from under
tables and in the back i cant trust
the natives

  thus he hired smith nominally as
aide-de-camp but actually as private
bodyguard the salary was  a
month and all expenses

  at the time the united states en-
tered the world war christmas was
military inspector of honduras the
veteran of many latin american cam-
paigns was eager to fight for the stars
and stripes resigning his official post
he hastened to washington obtained
a personal interview with president
wilson and volunteered the presi-
dent recommended that christmas be
given a commission however the
army doctors found he was no longer
strong enough for active service as he
was suffering from the recurrent ef-
fects of jungle fever besides carrying
in his body several bullets one of them
an inch from his heart

   im fifty-five but as physically fit
as any officer in the army christmas
insisted  and im willing to prove it
by fighting any man in the city who is
forty-five or more


railroad stories

  nevertheless the board was uncon-
vinced and he was sent to south
america to assist the united states
military intelligence service there
after the war he represented ameri-
can oil companies in petroleum ex-
plorations in central america until his
health broke down from jungle fever
and the bullet in his chest then he
returned to new orleans never to
leave it again

  while christmas was in a hospital
there his old comrade in arms guy

moloney who was now chief of police
of new orleans submitted to a blood
transfusion in an effort to save christ-
mass life the former hoghead rallied
and set about planning a new war

   maybe theyll make me president
this time he chuckled  ive always
wanted that job

  but the old warrior died quietly in
bed on january   at the age of
sixty-one hoping to the last that he
could go back to honduras and lead
another revolution

 free rides for indians

  until recently if you had traveled the  miles between
bowie and globe arizona you probably would have no-
ticed that every passing freight train on this road now a
branch of the southern pacific carried from ten to a hundred
or more apache indians the practice cut heavily into the
railroads passenger revenue to say nothing of the chances of
a damage suit in case an indian happened to fall beneath the
wheels but it was an old custom dating back some thirty-five
years the outcome of a pow-wow between officials and braves
on may   william garland then president of the arizona eastern railway
was forced to cease construction on his road at the little town of fort thomas just off
the san carlos reservation while he negotiated in vain with the apaches for per-
mission to build across the reservation to the town of globe then a pow-wow between
the redskins railroad men and government agents was held on the reservation octo-
ber   but still the unanimous approval of the apaches coukl not be obtained

  later another pow-wow was arranged for february   this ended in an
agreement that the indians be given  in cash full payment for any personal or
tribal property damaged or moved and free rides for all indians for thirty years

    these free rides often called for the stopping of a train at some whistling post
where it was forced to wait while the buck and his squaw with their children saddles
blankets pans buckets and other household equipment were loaded and safely located
the average red man preferred to ride an open flat or coal car where he could see the
sky and surrounding country apparently scorning anything so enclosed as a coach

         out of the storm he came a shivering
         bum homesick for the chattering brass

                  by charles w tyler

                   former fireman b  m author of clear iron etc

ho he was or where he
came from no one
knew-knew little and
cared less timmy mc-
carty appeared one
day on doane street boston this
was a long long time ago he
shuffled through the rear door or
messenger entrance of  state
street then the western union
main in that city and landed a job
as  trotter

  they gave him a number and a cap
that was much too large and sent him
out to learn the ropes timmy became
adept in the art of tramping the streets
a dime novel in one hand and a batch
of messages in the other

  the corner gangs taunted him tim-
my fought back singly and collec-
tively fought them as he had fought
for everything since he could first re-
member he wanted to be called  de
western union kid see and he
was

  the kid took to morse as a duck
does to water he learned the code

in western union branch offices in
boston the thing was in his blood
it was his natural element the key and
sounder

  he graduated at last from the
streets and a number to timmy mc-
carty operator but he was still the
western union kid

  then he began to drink and drift-
cincy chi frisco jacks and way sta-
tions he went to the top of his pro-
fession-and back to the gutter from
whence he had come all in a too brief
span of years  rum-dum a
booze-fighter haunting the old mains
hunting for a  px the price of a
meal

  he turned to the railroads looking
for jobs in lonely  os offices try-
ing to straighten himself out but it
didnt last long and soon he would be
back in the cities dirty bleary-eyed
unshaved traveling  under a flag
he took any name that pleased him
and yet he was still the western union
kid

  he liked to tell folks what he might


railroad stories

have been hed had his chance and
kicked it away but that was all right
he could do as he liked there was
nobody to care how quickly he went
to hell that was his business

then came a night when the west-
ern union kid found himself
ditched on the central valleys river
division a cold bleak night with
snow slanting savagely from the north-
east snow and sleet wires sagging
with their storm burden switches
frozen trains late

  the kid had slipped aboard the
smoker of no  a local at middle-
boro it was no night to ride the blind
or deck a hot shot a guy would freeze
to death riding freight also was out
of the question

  the storm had caught him too far
north he should have been on his
way south before this hed have
to make baytown where he could pick
up enough to tide him over until the
weather moderated by hanging around
the operators entrance of the western
union main it wouldnt be the first
time hed been  qb in this burg

  watching his chance the western
union kid had ducked into the narrow
space formed by seats being turned
back to back to make possible the usual
arrangement of card tables it was
a tight and uncomfortable spot but
warm he thawed out and rode
twenty miles before the keen-eyed con-
ductor spotted him

  he grinned ruefully as no 
slowed down at river view a brake-
man escorted him to the platform the
steps were slippery the dingy little
depot and the outside world were
veiled in white-a blurred blinding
white through which came the muffled
moan of the wind

  qb on the bum

   so long you old bum said the
trainman  looks like a long hard
winter

   who  me a bum  cried the wan-
derer indignantly  say i guess you
dont know who i am

   the duke of havalaff  suggested
the brakeman

   naw listen guy im the west-
ern union kid see i worked a
nyawk the apf an all em fast wires
in my time i never got lifted in my
life an ive paired with the best light-
nin slingers in the country i just had
a little tough luck-

  a few passengers got off and hur-
ried away through the storm toward
the warm lights of the little town the
conductor called  boa-a-rd a lan-
tern flashed and no  puffed off into
the night

  the western union kid pulled his
threadbare garments about him and
walked slowly along the platform a
baggage truck went scuttling away into
the night

  lights in the waiting room went out
only the mellow glow from the win-
dows of the telegraph office remained
the subdued clatter of telegraph in-
struments reached the ears of the man
outside

  it always made him a bit home-
sick the tick of a sounder and the
whisper of a relay

  the western union kid paused out-
side of the telegraph office his eye
searching the interior speculatively not
to say a bit dubiously these hick ops
were not always open to approach too
smug and self-satisfied like all home
guards take a boomer now they
knew what it was to be on the bum
maybe this guy on the second trick
was a boomer brass pounder maybe
hed listen to a tale of woe maybe

but the second trick operator at
river view was not a man it
was a woman and most certainly there
was nothing in her set scowling coun-
tenance to encourage a ragged vag of
the key little chance that shed let a
bo toast his shins a bit before the half-
open door of the small pot-bellied stove
in the corner

  a sour-looking old dame this one
they hadnt ought to have grandmas
like that thumping a trick well per-
haps the third trick guy was a better
bet

   ive got to get in somewhere the
kid told himself  or ill freeze as
stiff as a board no use tryin to ride
anything out of here tonight

  there was the calaboose of course
but them hick jugs was no picnic and
the judge might hand him thirty days
in the morning

  the western union kid sidled
around the comer of the station and
stood for a little huddled against the
side of the building out of the wind
he shivered winter winter with a
vengeance and no overcoat sum-
mer underwear too he had sure
waited too long before heading for
jacksonville this year

  what to do the telegraph office
looked mighty inviting-all but that
granite-faced female at the key shed
probably telephone the local john law
if he so much as stuck his head in the
door

  man that wind the kids feet
were frozen low shoes and a damned
thin sole if anybody should happen to
ask

   here goes nothin the kid told
himself straightening his stooped
shoulders and dabbing a grimy paw at
a frosted nose he moved toward the
door of the telegraph office  she
might be a reglar guy at that

  	r

for over thirty years almira burn-
ham had worked one wire on the
central valleys river division from
baytown to the hudson every railroad
man knew her she was stern ada-
mant with a caustic tongue and views
concerning the male of the species that
were not at all flattering

  men spoke of her as the  old maid
at river view and yet they respected
her even as they derided her

  young brakemen who had not had
the pleasure of making almira burn-
hams acquaintance and who came
storming into the telegraph office for
the first time profanely wanting to
know this or that in loud roisterous
tones always slunk out in a meek and
subdued manner

  the things that the lady on the
second trick could say to a man usually
left him limp and gasping and he sel-
dom made the mistake of bulging into
miss burnhams bailiwick in a like
tempo again

   see here mister she would thun-
der in cutting tones  what hog yard
were you brought up in wipe your
feet close the door and dont set
that lantern on the table

  that was almira burnham sixty-
three years young that she was a
maiden lady was a pretty generally ac-
cepted fact on the river division a
thing that the woman herself made no
effort to correct

  her life before she came to river
view was a closed book-closed to all
except pat regan superintendent
they had both come from the same
little vermont town at twenty al-
mira burnham had been a telegraph
operator at the country depot perched
there beside the tracks above the con-
necticut river pat regan then had
been a youngster of ten

  the year that pat had graduated


railroad stories

from high school almira burnham
married chet stewart stewart was
an op himself a careless easy-going
handsome fellow

  about that time young regans folks
moved to the city and pat got a job
on the railroad some years later re-
turning to the old home town on a
visit he heard the rest of the story

  a son had been born to mrs stew-
art a son in whose life the click of
telegraph instruments played a part al-
most from the first the boy was the
one thing that the woman lived for
now since chet had taken to drink
there were many bitter quarrels and
life became unbearable for the woman
she demanded at last that chet choose
between herself and booze

  sullen ugly unreasoning the man
made his decision he left home slip-
ping quietly away down the unknown
paths of the world but he did not go
alone he took the boy with him-
not because of any particular devotion
for his son but because he wanted to
hurt the woman

  a year or two later chet stewart
drunk walked off a dock in boston and
was mercifully drowned there was
nothing on the body by which to
identify him and chet passed out of
the picture as an unknown

  back in vermont a grief-stricken
woman closed the door on her yester-
day and walked down the road to the
station she was going to begin again
somewhere else she would follow the
wires across the horizon to a new
world a cheap little grip she took
that and her own name almira burn-
ham

  the years passed almira cold
grim unsmiling continued at the key
she was as much a part of river view
as the depot itself seven days a week
almira sat in at the telegraph office

she chose the second trick because she
had long come to dread lonely eve-
nings-and the busy hours at the sta-
tion between three and eleven filled this
dreaded period

  thus she sat on this cold winter
night-a dour wrinkled woman with
unsmiling eyes sitting at the key in
the telegraph office at river view out-
side the wind howled the snow pelted
the windowpane and the entire central
valley staggered from the impact of
the storm

the door of the telegraph office
opened slowly snow swirled sav-
agely across the threshold and a cold
draft rudely invaded the comforting
warmth of the room

  almira burnham turned her head
slowly a sharp rebuke on her tongue
but her lips clamped tight over the
unspoken words she stared at the
strange apparition framed against a
background of swirling flakes

  there stood a bo a gaunt creature
clothed in threadbare garments hesi-
tant he was plainly doubtful of the
reception he would get evidently he
was poised for instant retreat at the
first show of hostility

  the western union kids teeth
chattered in spite of himself his eyes
went to the stove and the warm glow
of coals visible through the half-open
door then back to the woman the
grimy fingers of his right hand tugged
at the visor of his shapeless cap and
he bowed stiffly

   gee but its a tough night outside
lady he pleaded  could i come in
an get warm for a few minutes

  almira burnhams particular abhor-
rence was tramps and in this classifica-
tion she included boomers there
were agencies to take care of vagrants
the town jail was the place for those
the western union kid



who inadvertently strayed into river
view at best they were a bothersome
menace

  the woman was on the point of in-
forming the intruder brusquely that the
local police usually provided accommo-
dation for bums but she didnt in-
stead she found herself staring at him
with some degree of tolerance

   well shut the door she snapped
finally  dont stand there like a
ninny letting all greenland in here
where did you come from on a night
like this anyway

   it was the brass buttons on that
local explained the kid edging to-
ward the stove he spoke without ran-
cor it was all a part of being a bum
getting kicked off trains  i was
headin for the big burg an doin fine
until his nibs pulls me out from be-
tween the seats he fought off a
little spasm that shook his entire body
 geez aint it funny how a guy gets
the jigs-when he c-comes in out of-
the c-cold

  hump sniffed the lady at the
telegraph table   if youd get a job
and stay put you wouldnt be out
freezing to death on a night like this
 i had a job said the other  i
had dozens of em but my dogs always
gets loose on me an just as quick as
i catch up with em theyre gone again
my dogs-an booze

   booze i would have suspected
as much whats your name

   timmy mccarty he answered
promptly  better known as the west-
ern union kid

   the western union kid 

  he nodded  yuh you see im a
brass pounder miss i worked all the
fast ones-until i went rum-dum
the sounder barked the river view
station call and the woman turned
slowly in her chair and reached for the

key it was a  order for no 
the heavy pullman train from the
west was already bowing to the will
of the storm she was one hour off
the advertised

almira burnham at last

lpushed back the pad of yellow
tissues and got up she went to a cup-
board took out a coffee pot she put
water in the pot and set it on the stove
her keen eyes seemed to bore straight
into the soul of the western union
kid he fidgeted and shivered

  the woman frowned  guess youre
hungry aint you

  the western union kid eyed the
coffee pot then wet his lips with his
tongue and drew a long breath this
was a little bit of heaven he hadnt ex-
pected the old dame was a reglar
guy after all

   marm he added  i dont know
what it is not to be hungry after a
pause he added frankly  mostly
when i get a couple of dimes i buy a
hooker of booze

   youre a fool the woman re-
torted and then in a more kindlv
tone   guess you thought it was smart
to drink at first

   nom the kid shook his head
reflectively  i thought if a guy
didnt drink he wouldnt get to be no-
body my old man could lick six cops
when he was soused

  the train wire sounder sputtered a
moment a relay on the shelf in front
of the window began muttering a sub-
dued call the woman turned to
change a spring-jack at the bottom of
the switchboard for a while she was
busy testing-trying different set-ups
grounding first this wire and then that
east-and west

  the western union kid watched
his ear tuned to pick up the terse tele-


railroad stories

graphic idiom that rattled from the
sounder

   i bet that western union wire
chief in the main is pullin out his
hair the kid chuckled  hes lost
two more trunk lines an theyre tryin
to make a patch through worcester an
springfield but their lines aint no
better its goin to be tough to get
anything through by mornin

   the only train wire weve got the
woman said grimly as she at last
turned from the switchboard  is that
old number three commercial iron
and that has a bad swing

  summit to the west reported extra
 pulling in to clear no  a few
moments later the dispatcher was again
busy flashing train orders extra 
would run as second no  summit to
baytown

   whats the idea of runnin an extra
as second section to a hot shot asked
the western union kid

   the  is number s return
miss burnham explained  that is
one of the fast freights theyre short
of motive power at baytown and
theyll need that engine for  tomor-
row the crew is on short time

   o k said the kid

  an extra double-heading west came
panting laboriously up the grade the
two big freight haulers stopped outside
of the telegraph office and the con-
ductor and head brakeman hurried into
the little room at the corner of the
depot

  any time on number nineteen
demanded the conductor

   what would you do with any time
on nineteen almira flung back tart-
ly  youve been two hours on the
hill and youll be two hours more mak-
ing the hump

   helper aint steamin growled the
trainman  had to stop three times

an blow er hot an we pulled a lung
startin the last time

   well youd better pull in at the
water tank said the woman  nine-
teen is thirty minutes late but theyre
not giving time yet got trouble
enough keeping the wheels moving
only one wire in here right now
everything will be down before morn-
ing

growling fretfully the conduc-
tor and brakeman went out five
long-drawn whistle blasts shrilled
above the wail of the wind a few
minutes later the two big engines eased
back for the slack then began their
laborious task of starting the heavy
train the hoarse bark of their exhausts
hurling forth a challenge to the slash-
ing white tempest

  almira reported the departure of the
extra a few minutes later summit
seven miles west osd no  by the
limited was  carrying green extra
 began to creep toilsomely from a
passing track with its all too heavy-
laden string of multi-colored cars on
its headlight it carried now the num-
erals  nd no

turbed from its slumbers moving petu-
lantly onto the river divisions east-
bound main iron there to become a
plaything in the hands of the bold and
rampant storm gods

  a sluggish unwieldy giant this
second no  as she crawled forth
her movement hampered by cold and
snow

  a slow labored exhaust interrupted
by occasional petulant blasts from the
stack as the big hog  lost her feet-
the sharp squeal and plaint of chilled
wheels on a frosted rail-the creak of
cars and draft rigging-the added bur-

   lung is slang for draw-bar
the western union kid



den of snow and ice on car roofs and
a treacherous path under a tablecloth
of white down the long trail of the
hurricane deck-all these masked a
lurking something that spelled disaster

  bill holman grimly exultant that
the way had been cleared for the speedy
return of extra  nursed the big
engine for all there was in her it had
taken three attempts before he had
been able to get the heavy train in
motion

  there was a slight grade against
him but a half a mile east of the pass-
ing track the rails dipped downward
for fourteen miles on a one-and-a-half
percent grade-down past hillcrest
river view way land and on to
lynchburg

  quick the long train picked up speed
as the wheels tipped over the hump
double green showed on the automatic
at the summit as bill holman squinted
up at it through the driving snow

  no  would drop down the hill
quickly the freight would lag a little
because of the twenty-miles-an-hour
speed restriction that applied to all
eastbound freight trains between sum-
mit and lynchburg

  the limited however would be in
the lynchburg station nearly ten
minutes which would bring the freight
close on her tail there at the red home
signal around the bend

  jimmy gilman picked up his lantern
and swung from the firemans seat to
the deck of the  buttoning his coat
in preparation for his task of beating
back over the storm-swept car tops to
set up retainers

  how many bill he called

  bill holman hesitated an instant be-
fore replying as he checked the duplex
air-gage it read seventy for the brake
pipe and ninety for the main reservoir
everything was all right apparently

and yet he had a strange feeling of
uneasiness

   turn up thirty tonight jimmy he
said referring to the retaining valves
which act as a safety measure on the
down grade we want everything
under control with that high iron job
ahead of us

gilman pulled on his gloves
slipped the handle of his lantern
over his arm and climbed onto the
tender he shook his head and blinked
as the full fury of the storm struck
him

  it was a nasty night nasty and
cold he moved slowly back along the
rightly named hurricane deck his body
bent to the slashing northeaster

  leering and triumphant the storm
gods looked on it was all a horrible
joke thirty retainers thirty cars
dragging their brakes like boys on a
double-runner with their heels down

  that was how it should have been
but already something had happened-
and the devils own was riding second
no 

  caught by the pull of the one-and-a-
half percent grade the freight quickly
increased its speed with full tonnage
lending its thrust to the forces that
drove it on

  bill holman confident of his ability
to control the train did not immedi-
ately make a service reduction

  at last he swung the handle of the
brake equipment making a service re-
duction of some twenty pounds but
nothing resulted

  a terrible premonition struck deep
he waited then fearfully he made
a second reduction only a brief blow
from the train pipe after the first re-
lease they were on the hill without
brakes

  way across-into the big hole-


railroad stories

went the brake handle emergency
but there was only a slight gurgle the
heavy train was rushing on faster and
faster

   weve lost our brakes bill hol-
mans voice rose above the din of their
going were riding into hell he
snatched at the whistle cord and a
shrieking wail ripped through the
storm like a cry of a lost soul  get
out and start tying em down

  with a frightened oath the fireman
leaped to obey

  the engineer applied the engine
brake but it made no impression
against the horde of snarling demons
behind he fought her into back mo-
tion and opened the throttle knowing
as he did it that it was a futile effort

   weve got a frozen train line he
told himself  right behind us a few
cars either that or somebody turned
an angle cock

  he whistled again a blood-curdling
scream

  bill holmans first guess had been
right a frozen air hose three cars
back was the cause of the trouble and
added to this tragic little kink in the
ordinarily smooth order of things the
brakes on the rest of the train line back
had been drained by a slow leak there
at summit

  bill remembered other trains that
had gone wild on the hill men would
always talk of them death and dis-
aster had followed in their wake and
now his train they would pile up on
a curve somewhere-or race down the
grade and plunge into the rear of no
 at lynchburg

the train wire sounder at red
river exploded into a mad and
imperative summons

   rw rw rw-hc

  tests but a few minutes before had
revealed that no  had failed river
view had a ground on to the east thus
making possible communication with
hillcrest and other stations west

  almira burnham answered the call
with a brief  i-i-

   i-i-rw

  came a chattering stream of frantic
morse characters pounded out by a
wild-eyed operator at hillcrest

    nd  by hr out of control whis-

  iing fr brakes

  almira uttered a little cry and
turned again to the switchboard she
took the ground off the train wire hop-
ing that by some miracle it might have
been cleared no it was still open
she dropped hopelessly into her chair

  the western union kid made sev-
eral hurried tests but the sleet had
played havoc with the wires earlier
efforts to reestablish communication
before the failure of no  had re-
vealed that all lines were in trouble be-
tween lynchburg and river view
the last contact to the east had been
with a western union lineman west of
lynchburg

   looks like the big bust is between
here an wayland exclaimed the
tramp operator excitedly if we
could only raise em down there bet
they got a wire east

   its no use replied the woman
she was trembling  wayland is just
a flag station with an agent in the day-
time the office is closed at night
the agent lives a mile away

  the western union kid went to the
door he was muttering fitful little
oaths which punctuated vague and
wild declarations

   dammit we got to get to wayland
the western union kid



got to do it man that hog an her
blasted string is goin to hit em plenty
got to get goin

  you cant get to wayland cried
the other in exasperation  dont
talk like a fool

   aint there no speeder in this
burg demanded the kid  aint
there what kind of a dump is it
got to get down there-

a lantern appeared from the
direction of the freight shed
both miss burnham and the western
union kid ran to meet it dan
obrien section foreman had been
clearing snow and ice from main line
switches in the yards with some sec-
tion hands

   four forty-ones return passed
hillcrest out of control screamed the
woman  its running as second
eight and the limited is just ahead of
em what can we do cant get the
dispatcher everythings failed
we cant do nothin declared the
foreman  only pray to god they can
wind up brakes enough to check em
 the hell we cant do nothin
snarled the western union kid aint
there a speeder or a hand-car or some
damn thing in this town i can ride  i
just got to get over to wayland i tell
you

  youre crazy stormed obrien
if they cant tie em down on the
freight shell go through like a bat
out of hell youd be killed

   an theres plenty more goin to
be killed if i dont make a stab at it
the kid flung back  i gotta make
it his voice rose shrilly  get out
somethin with wheels on it you big
turk come on

  dan obrien started away in a blun-
dering run the wanderer of the key
on his heels just across the tracks

was the blurred outline of the tool
house

   theres the signal mans speeder
panted the section boss  its faster
than the hand-car you might-

   i will rasped the kid

  the door was slammed back and to-
gether they lifted the three-wheeled
vehicle to the rail

   why dont you go down the west-
bound the section foreman wanted
to know

  but almira burnham gray hair
tossed about her face by the wind was
there with an instant counter to this
suggestion

   no they called a crew in lynch-
burg over an hour ago to go west
theyll be coming up the hill light
youd only be going against em any-
way number eight cleared the east-
bound rail of snow just a few minutes
ago it will be easier going

   put a maul on here snapped the
western union kid  i got to bust
the door

   and the lantern dan cried the
woman breathlessly  the lantern-
quick hell need a light and no time
to try and get a kerosene lamp going

  a moment later the big foreman was
pushing the speeder with all of his
might while the lone rider swayed
back and forth throwing himself into
his task with a strength born of des-
peration

   holy mother pray for him
choked obrien as he gave a last
shove

   the lord moves in mysterious
ways said miss burnham her eyes
misty with tears

  the western union kid turned his
head  one good turn deserves an-
other he shouted back over his
shoulder

  a moment later the slashing flakes


railroad stories

had closed about the bo on the speeder
and he was lost in the blackness

the clock in the telegraph office at
river view ticked the all too
swift parade of seconds a minute
passed two three four five
a five-minute handicap in a race with
death the western union kid had

  plunging careening snarling she
came second no  she hurtled
out of the snow-lashed night a charg-
ing boiler-front rimmed with snow a
dim-lit cab crashing drivers and a
lurching engine behind thundered a
train of drunken cars flanges shriek-
ing wheels spitting fire

  the speed was so great that the
trainmen on second no  could do
little more now than cling desperately
to brake-wheels bill holman face
drawn and haggard was still at his
post the whistle once more screamed
its hysterical warning

  there was the hope that the opera-
tors on duty at hillcrest and river
view would get a message to the first
section in time for the limited to pull
into the clear at lynchburg if it held
the rail the runaway could be brought
under control on the slight grade im-
mediately east of the lynchburg yards

  three miles west of wayland the
western union kid glimpsed a tangle
of wires at a spot where a pole had
given away everything down that
was the way it looked

  chances were the man on the speed-
er told himself thered be something
east of wayland this might be the
only bad break on the hill he felt
sure hed get a wire down there

  all he had to do now was to beat
second no  to the black and deserted
little telegraph office that stood as the
finish line in this desperate race be-
tween a train running wild and a man-

driven little speeder that was all-
just make wayland

  stinging particles cut at the face of
the western union kid the wind
eddied about him in savage gusts
snatching at his garments and making
it difficult to get his breath except
for vague and ghostly shapes that now
and then appeared for a fleeting in-
stant he could see nothing the bliz-
zard engulfed him

  suddenly a headlight winked
through the blackness and a black
shape trundled past on the westbound
track it was an engine and caboose
a startled oath burst from the man on
the speeder his nerves were keyed
to a high pitch

   thats the light hitch the old dame
spoke about he muttered  damn
thing liked to scare me to death

  he pumped with all his might jerk-
ing back and forth until it seemed thaf
his arms must be wrenched from his
gaunt frame he certainly was in no
physical condition to stand the gaff
long soon hed be fighting on nerve
alone

  now and then he turned his head to
glance fearfully over his shoulder lit-
tle chance that he would get more than
a moments warning from the charging
freight it would be up his back be-
fore he knew it

  he had no way of knowing how far
he had come or yet of the distance that
remained wayland was somewhere
down the hill he hoped it was close

a green switch lamp cast its
winking gleam through the
storm the man on the speeder now
little more than an animated snowball
saw it he was getting close the
rails broke in a long curve cars in a
passing track loomed close on his right

  and then roaring out of the night
the western union kid



he flung himself out
of the path of that
rushing pilot



there behind him came second no 
there was the flash of a headlight and
a crashing iron thunder of the run-
away train now bearing down on the
midget speeder and its rider

  no time to use the brake no chance
to save the maul or the lantern scarce-
ly time to save himself the western
union kid flung himself from his seat
in a desperate dive out of the path of
that rushing pilot

  the snow between the rails of the
westbound tracks cushioned his fall
he rolled over and over in a furry
mass of white while in his ears there
echoed a terrible din of wheels and
trucks his hurtling body came to rest
at last beside a bit of raised planking
it was the platform of the little depot
at wayland

  he dragged himself to his feet with
an effort and blundered toward the

station he fought for breath
in blubbering gasps

something stabbed his side
with pain his left leg
threatened to crumple under
him his face was scraped
and bloody but only one thought per-
sisted in the brain of this frail and
ragged wanderer

  the key he just had to get to
the key just let lady luck give him
a smile and he would come through

  every second was precious no
time to waste hunting for something
to break down the door and he had no
strength to waste on futile efforts
one way in and only with bare
hands the western union kid smashed
the glass of a window in the little bay
of the telegraph office and then
dragged himself across the sill

  he cut himself unmercifully but
neither knew nor cared about his
wounds he had reached his objec-
tive a wire was here under his hands
if only that thin-drawn bit of iron was
still riding high to its cross-arm perch
between here and lynchburg


railroad stories

  the western union kid fumbled
for a match but there was snow in the
pocket he was going to plug in the
local set he could do it in the dark
in a blundering fashion but he might
get a commercial circuit set up and he
wanted that no  the train wire last
in use

  his eye caught a faint yellow gleam
from the little pot-bellied stove in the
corner there was a trace of fire yet
on the grate

  he reached for a pad of train order
tissues on the telegraph table he
ripped away a dozen sheets jerked
open the door of the stove and tossed
them onto what remained of the coal
fire they flared up

  the western union kid found the
brief illumination thus afforded suffi-
cient for him to make out the numbers
pasted on the side of the switchboard
his bleeding fingers caught at the little
plugs feverishly

  he cut in no  grounding it to the
west then reached for the key al-
ready the murmur of the relay and the
click of the sounder had told him that
the wire was good to the east

  he pounded out a call he knew
the lynchburg letters from his brief
efforts in the telegraph office up there
at river view

   nb nb nb-wd

the lynchburg operator strained
toward the chattering sounder in
the resonator on the table before him
who in hell had opened up the office
at wayland one of the linemen he
reasoned as soon as he answered the
morse from wayland was rapped out
in a furious burst

    clr the eastbound nd  wild by

  hr wd

  the operator sprang up yelling at

a half a dozen railroad men lounging
in a room near by they dashed down
the stairs there were warning shouts
lanterns waved madly and trainmen
raced into action

  two terse blasts broke from the
dome of the engine on first no  as a
brakeman bawled at the cab followed
the immediate hiss of releasing air and
the quick cough of the exhaust from
deep in the throat of the big pacific
couplings jerked and the cars began
to move

  down in the yards a switchlight
glowed red a lantern moved up and
down weaving in off the main went
the varnished cars of the limited at
last the marker lights showed in clear
and the switch again flicked to green

  almost before the switch points had
lined the iron of the eastbound main
there came a blasting screech of a
freight engines whistle crying
through the storm from just around
the bend

  a headlight stabbed the snow-laden
blackness and a rocking locomotive ca-
reened from the tangent and flung her-
self at the lynchburg depot cars
borne by thundering wheels streamed
behind at a speed that no man dared
estimate the miracle was that the
runaway had stayed on the iron

  a smashing blast of snow swept the
platform as the iron-tipped tornado
lunged past and second no  was
by-with first  safe in the clear with
its precious cargo of human freight

  far on past the yards to the east
bill holman a hero in his own right
brought the freight to a stop a switch-
er came out with a yard crew to lend
aid to the nerve-shaken trainmen on
second no  the frozen air hose
was cleared the brakes pumped up and
the long drag backed into the yards

  pat regan superintendent was in
the western union kid



lynchburg that night and he was one
of the first to talk to holman and give
him a pat on the back

   yeah said the engineer who had
recently emerged from a brush with
death  but who in hell was the bird
coming down the hill ahead of us on a
speeder 

   a speeder  cried regan the
light of understanding suddenly
dawned  the hell you say

   the hell i do declared the engi-
neer  it popped out of the blackness
right under our pilot as we were pass-
ing wayland depot we hit that thing
and knocked it so high i bet it wont
ever come down there was somebody
on it but i dont know whether they
jumped or not before we socked em
it was that close

  by damn cried regan i see
it all now we had lost our wires some-
where east of river view not a cir-
cyit was working through when you
tipped over the hump hillcrest must
have got a flash to river view that you
were out of control but almira burn-
ham couldnt raise us here so some-
body grabbed a speeder and started
for wayland ahead of you might
have been that old girl herself i don-t
know

   if it was said bill holman rev-
erently  ill kiss the frozen-faced old
grouch every time i go through there
for the rest of my life

   ill kiss her anyhow declared re-
gan  because if she didnt ride the
blasted speeder herself she was respon-
sible for the one who did by judas
that was railroading

almira burnham and pat re-
k- gan met at the hospital two
veterans of the river division both
were stern-faced rough-spoken big-
hearted a lovable pair of human be-

ings half ashamed of their own finer
qualities

  you here growled mr regan

  well what of it barked the
woman  cant a body visit the sick
if they got a mind to without answer-
ing to a brass hat

  the superintendent eyed almira
burnham closely she was stiff and
formal in her sunday best but there
was a strange light in her face a hint
of moisture in her eyes and a slight
quiver of the lip when she spoke

  he was a little puzzled he already
knew something of the story of the
night before but he wanted to know
more of it he wanted it from almira
burnham herself

  and she told him-told him of the
bo who came cringing in out of the
storm told him of the western union
kid the wistful wanderer who had
stepped into the breach offering to pay
with his life for a cup of coffee and a
kind word

   huh grunted regan swallowing
a lump with an effort and blowing his
nose noisily  so that was the how
of it ill be damned hur-rump
humph brass pounder a boomer
eh  good man to have around lets
go in and talk to him-you and me

  the western union kid for all the
torment of his bruised and torn body
was warm and content everything
was white and clean the bed was
comfortable the doc and the nurse
smiled at him and spoke cheeringly
outside the sun was shining on a
world of dazzling white it wasnt
such a bum break for a guy at that

  almira burnham and pat regan
came and stood by the bed looking
down at him

   howre you feeling brass pound-
er the superintendent inquired
gruffly


railroad stories

   swell declared the other wincing
from a flash of pain  i-i aint been
so comfortable for years

   it was a terrible chance you took
said the woman  i want to be the
first to tell you what a brave thing it
was to do we all owe you a sight
more than we can ever repay

   aw-w geez lady the western
union kid protested  it want noth-
in id do it again y know it was
tough to be on the bum last night an
that old telegraph office was sorta like
heaven with the instruments clickin
an that shaded light an fire in the
store-an that mug of java say i
coulda gone to hell with a cheer after
that

   i want to see you when you get on
your feet again said regan in a sym-
pathetic tone  what did you say your
name was

  the western union kid came
the reply  i usta be called timmy
mccarty but that want me real name
me old man was chet stewart an
he-

   chet-stewart almira burnham
gasped  why-why-

  suddenly she was not a sour-faced
old woman any more her features
glowed sunshine was there sun-
shine and tears she turned to pat
regan rested a hand on his arm and
said

   thats my boy

  a boomers reverie

when the days are long and woods full of song
and the grass grows wild and free

 and the days as bright as a hogs headlight
 through a night of dark immensity

 when springtimes come and insects hum

 and the wood dove coos to his mate

 and a joyful note comes from the throat
 of some big long through freight

 when they whistle off and give a cough

 that means theyre on their way

 my hearts right there where the headlights glare
 plays on the ribbons that takes em away

 theres more delight on some wild night

 when the rain is pouring down

 in riding a  through  to scenes that are new
 than switching cars in town

 theres a musical sound as the wheels go round
 and the miles go racing by

 it kind of relieves a heart that grieves

 to feel youre as free as the birds on high

 dont tell me a word of the home-guard bird
 whose pays as sure as fate

 if he likes it all right but its beat a damsite
 making the miles on a long through freight

 gyp  scott and terry obrien went
over the top entered the cupola
through the side window fished paper
bags from leather grips and began a
midnight lunch

his early twenties terry had been born
in the province of manitoba and reared
in the state of arkansas gypsy scott
black-haired dark-complexioned metic-
ulously dressed was a native of the

 ozark hills ever since the night four
 years ago when he had pulled terry
 out of the burning wreck of an oil
 drag down below muskogee they had
 been booming together this fall terry
 had persuaded gyp to come north and
 help run the trains of the dominion
 while her sons were gone to war

   they were making their first trip

   while they ate conductor graham
 entered from the rear made notes on
 a delay sheet and came to join them
 swinging into the seat opposite gyp
 he handed over a single sheet of tissue
 with its clearance

  were following number one
down the hill he told terry  shell
be by in forty minutes

 
ex-brakeman author
of speed limits etc

they were trapped on
the bridge - to front
and rear there was no
escape t

   ok cap breezed terry
 well feed the face an be over at the
head ready to open the gate

  gyp who worked the rear unfolded
and read the order

  extra  east has right over
  number  eng  devils gateway
  to loup garou

 loup garou mused gyp
werewolf huh helluva name for
a railroad station

   is rawther queer old bill gra-
ham did not look up he tamped a load
in the short stemmed pipe and lighted
it  the tunnel ahead of us comes in-

to a canyon of the same name he
made no further comment

  terry finished his lunch and went to
the head end shortly before midnight
no i passed and no  followed her
out

  as soon as they emerged from the
tunnel gyp and terry hit the tops set-
ting air retaining valves so the engineer
could hold the heavy train on the
twenty-five mile grade into devils
gateway by the time they met a half
mile of the canyon was behind them
in the soft light of the waning moon
they peered about

  the loup garou was a box canyon
the level floor a scant quarter mile in

by e s
dellinger


railroad stories

width was covered with gigantic
spruce trees walls of gray granite
rose sheer for a thousand feet the
canyon ended abruptly at the east as
if some giant had cut through the
mountain with a scroll saw and lifted
bodily from its setting the irregular
chunk of granite which the waters of
ages had worn away

   the loup garou huh  gyp said
again

   sure would be a spooky spot to go
flaggin at one am terry said with
a laugh

  gyp shrugged

 a mile rolled backward under
scorching wheels brakes groaned and
muttered box cars bucked and
jostled the two buddies stood side by
side watching the gash of the loup
garou unwind

  while they watched the whistle
sounded it was two short blasts the
answer to a signal they listened the
echoes bounded back and forth like the
echoes of a gunshot in a lonely vacant
cabin before these echoes died away
the whistle sounded again this time a
long blast was followed by three short
ones-the signal to gyp to go back into
the canyon and protect the rear end of
the train

  gyp was not perturbed he trotted
back over the train to get his lantern
and fusees and a moment later disap-
peared around the curve

  terry went to the engine when he
slid into the cab a uniformed passenger
flagman from no i was talking to the
engineer

  whats the matter pard terry
asked

   i dont know buddy the flagman
answered  the hoghead kicked on
the air an we stopped just around the
curve

  engineer mike mulcahey pulled no

 down against the rear of no i
terry and mike went with the flagman
to the last coach of the passenger train
while they waited no is conductor
came back

   whats up squiers  queried
mike

   gaston keeled over the conduc-
tor spoke softly

   gaston cried the flagman you
dont mean hes-

   dead as a door nail finished the
conductor  fireman said he looked at
him once said he was sittin up straight
as a string a minute later the air went
on he went over to see what was
wrong and bert gaston was stone
dead

   well if that dont beat hell mut-
tered mike  reckon theyll call this
heart disease

   this damned ghost walks sure got
it in for that gaston family squiers
said slowly

   three of em muttered mike

  terry old bill graham and mike
mulcahey went with the two passenger
men over to the head of no i they
were there a long while

  questioning the flagman terry
heard briefly the story of the canyon

when white men came the place
had been the haunt of a pack of
timber wolves trappers had come into
it-and had not gone out other trap-
pers built up legends the pack of
wolves was led by a  werewolf -a
 loup garou the trappers had
named the canyon-and had shunned
it

  the english had come they had
been skeptics they had explored the
canyon and had built the railroad
through it both during and since con-
struction things had happened copi-
ous records kept by them showed a
the girl at loup garou



natural cause for every catastrophe
which had occurred according to
these records there was nothing un-
usual about it the fact that the gas-
ton family practically had been wiped
out during the last fifteen years was
due solely to the law of chance so
was the fact that most of the trouble
had come during the month of febru-
ary and the fact that the ever-lessen-
ing pack of timber wolves returned for
a few days to the dismal reaches of the
canyon was due to the habits of the
beasts themselves hunting the decreas-
ing game supply

  here the flagman had shrugged sig-
nificantly as though he himself were a
bit skeptical and had volunteered the
information that over at the rooming
house in devils gateway was an old
breed trapper a man who had lived a
hundred years within sight of the snow
peaks hanging over it this old man
soothe flagman said had explained it all
in one brief sentence

    cest le loup gar on

  terry looked at the flagman rasped
out one word

   bunk

  finally mike mulcahey took charge
of the passenger engine terry fired
the freight and the fireman ran it they
went on in

the little blond lightning slinger

it was this same morning shortly
after bert gaston had died that
marie gaston began figuring in the
lives of the two boomers and terry
contrary to custom met her first

  now terry was not a ladies man
gyp scott was ever since they had
been booming together gyp had dolled

up had ridden the caboose and had
kept an eye on the women terry had
worn rough clothes had worked the
head end had taken the raps and had
looked after gyp feeling that he owed
his life to his handsome partner terry
had followed like a faithful hound

  if gyp craved amusement at stud or
draw terry rolled up his sleeves and
took a hand true terry had no luck
at cards and his hands were clumsy
gyps luck was good and his fingers
were slim sensitive and supple
in fact more than once terry had
bruised brawny fists on boomer mouths
which dared suggest maybe gyps luck
was too good and his fingers too nim-
ble so engrossed had terry been in
looking after gyp that it had been four
years since he had had a new suit of
clothes or the price of a smiling date

  on this september morning they
drifted down into loup garou it con-
sisted of a lone telegraph office a pass-
ing track and a house  yards away
where the day operator lived with his
wife and two babies as they rounded
the curve the fireman called across the
cab

    hi gft that order over there will
yuh

  now terry had grabbed thousands
of orders from an engine step he had
often boasted that in six years braking
he had never missed a hoop

  this morning whether it was the
sweet tear-stained face which peered
fearfully up at the gigantic engine or
the graceful curves of her small lithe
figure terry was not able to deter-
mine he always declared of course it
was because he had glazed his eyeballs
peering into the red hot firebox what-
ever the cause he got his blue eyes
tangled up in a fleeting glimpse of face
and curves and never could get them
back on the order hoop


railroad stories

  he missed the hoop as a bungling
student would he yelled at the fire-
man the fireman applied the rest of
his air terry leaped off on both feet
took a spill and went back for the
order

  when he met the little operator
stumbling down the platform her blue
eyes were moist her chin was quiver-
ing

   im-im so sorry sir she quav-
ered  i guess i was not holding it
right i-

  thats all right miss terry as-
sured her he fumbled with the order
a long while admiringly scanned the
tearful face  why yuh see i missed
that order you wasnt to blame at all
it was me that bungled dont you cry
another bit about it

  terry assumed of course that the
girl was crying because he had missed a
   order he did not know her
tears were for her only uncle bert gas-
ton who had just died at his throttle
coming down the loup garou it wtas
days before he learned that fact or
knew how intricately the threads of her
life were intertwined with the loup
garou it was weeks before he and
gyp began to realize how through her
the hand of fate was surely weaving
their own lives into the fantastic pat-
tern

again gyp and terry were on no
- again their drag was drop-
ping down the narrow slit of the loup
garou on both sides gray granite
cliffs towered toward the stars and be-
yond the cliffs rugged peaks glistened
white in the dull glow of the waning
moon

  one long blast of the engine whistle
on the midnight air proclaimed that the
train had passed a whistling post and
a second later a short sharp toot in-

formed the men that the engineer re-
membered a meeting point at the lonely
station in the haunted canyon

  even before the whistle sounded
brakeman terry obrien was hopping
nimbly over the frosty tops going for-
ward to open the switch so matt mul-
cahey could get the train into the clear
without stopping no  due shortly
from the west matt was wthistling
when terry leaped the tank and slid
down the coal into the deck

   its time ye was gittin over here
ye red-headed son of erin roared a
good-natured engineer  i thought it
was meself was goin to have to get out
an-

   keep yer collar on ye blabber- 
mouthed lung puller terry roared
back  any time your head brake-
mans terry obrien you can
figure-

  he did not finish his sentence al-
ready the green glow of the light at the
passing track switch was showing on
the short tangent terry crawled over
the running board slipped across the
steel platform of the  and stood
on the four-inch plate which runs along
the nose of the pilot the switchlight
swam toward him through the narrow
lane in the tall ranks of alaskan
spruce among the moss-laden trunks
the headlight played on flitting shad-
ows like the ghosts of dead things
when the green light was fifty yards
away he left the step sprinted to the
switch unlocked it threw it for the
passing track and signaled ahead

  as the engine swerved in past him
he swung himself deftly on the four
inch ledge he did not let the train
run by as he often did in the first
place no  was due within ten min-
utes and when a passenger train is
that close a good brakeman stays near
the head end so he can do a job of flag-
the girl at loup garou



ging besides terry remembered
things had happened around loup
garou

  that was one reason he caught the
pilot

  the other reason he had not seen for
a week he hoped she was still on duty
at the telegraph office on the curve

eagerly he peered into the dark-
ness as the engine rounded the
bend the order board was green
there was a white light wiggling on
the platform beneath it terrys pulse
quickened

  the engine passed the station terry
swung off the pilot step under pretense
of watching the train run by but he
did not watch long he crossed the
main track toward the wiggling white
lantern in the glow of the light from
the bay window he caught the glint of
green and beneath the green the un-
mistakable flash of smiling teeth he
sauntered nearer the light

   good morning op he breezed

   good morning brakie

  the answer was in a piping girlish
voice the kind of voice he had asso-
ciated with that face and figure

  hows tricks

   oh just fine thank you how are
you

   ok i reckon

  the cars were rattling by terry
tried to think of something else to say

  when nearly half the train had gone
his keen nostrils detected a taint in the
pure mountain air an instant later his
ear picked up a sound there was no
mistaking either noise or odor a few
cars back from the middle of the train
was a hot journal box it was squeal-
ing for grease

  terry smothered a vicious  damn
the girl looked quickly around

   did you say something 

   i said i had a hot box snapped
terry

  as if suddenly remembering that
she should report to a dispatcher the
arrival of a freight train the young
lady started into the office terry
glanced after her a shapely hand was
adjusting a green tam glimpsing hand
and tam terry was tempted to follow
her in and let gyp look after the hot
box

  instead of following the impulse he
grabbed the reeking car as it passed and
rode it down to clear all the way oc-
casional spurts of flame burst from the
smoking journal and continual bursts
of profanity from the lips of the brake-
man when the train stopped he lifted
the lid of the journal box flame shot
out the packing was on fire

  terry slammed down the lid and
started to the caboose as he came in
sight of the office a white light detached
itself from the string of box cars
crossed the platform and disappeared
inside

terrys lips tightened gyp scott
had always boasted that once he
had his foot in the door of a womans
affections there was no resisting his
advance terry had never questioned
it until now he had never given a
hoot

  his step quickened he fairly ran to
the office and flung open the door gyp
was already perched on the instrument
table his leg dangling and his hand-
some face familiarly near the girls

terry stopped

  gyp fingered a green silk tie on his
black sateen shirt flecked dust from a
brown kid shoe he winked at terry
more than once terry had seen that
wink for the first time in four years
he felt a surge of jealous rage rising
against the partner


railroad stories

   weve got a hot one over here
gyp he informed  weve got to put
in a brass

   thats too bad kid gyp breathed
 suppose you run on back to the crum-
my and fetch over the outfit maybe
ill come out an help brass it right
now-

  terry glowered gyp smiled and
smirked and winked again terry
looked down at the little operator she
was blushing and she did not look at
him with a smothered oath he strode
from the office

  the way car rocked and swayed with
the violence of his entry old bill gra-
ham veteran canadian conductor
looked up in surprise

   whats the matter  he asked

   weve got a hot one over here
mumbled terry  weve got to brass
it

  working furiously terry got to-
gether the two-man load he jabbed
packing hook and tool into the dope
pail he slammed a ten-inch brass into
the dope beside them he yanked out
a screw jack an iron bar and an oak
block finally he filled the water pail
at the caboose barrel

  all the while the old scotch-cana-
dian was watching him as terry be-
gan collecting into two hands the load
for four bill sauntered up behind

   may i ask where the black haired
blighter is he queried

  if you mean my partner hes over
there terry answered belligerently

  the old man stuffed a slim train
book into a jumper pocket took the
water pail and the jack block away
from terry and followed him out of
the car as they approached the smok-
ing hot box gyp scott came out of the
office he was whistling the con-
ductor looked at gyp and then at
terry

  no  ran the brakemen brassed
the journal by the time they had
finished terrys little flare had left
him he was whistling and joking but
all the while he was thinking of the
little blonde in the lonely station old
bill graham came back before they
finished he eyed the two brakemen
again but didnt say a word

bill grahams caboose was
equipped like a cafe car terry
was a first-class chef as well as a brake-
man so they cooked and ate on the car
when they were in devils gateway
that is terry cooked and gyp and
bili ate

  old bill never spoke that morning
either while terry was frying the ham
and eggs or during the meal terry
was not surprised for the conductor
was stingy with words

  terry didnt talk much himself he
kept thinking about a pair of blue eyes
and a green tam and a mass of flaxen
curls terry felt strange something
had come to him which he had never
known before gyp scott in his usual
way discussed the little blonde light-
ning slinger down on the ghostwalk
wondered if she didnt get lonesome
all by herself reckoned she should be
glad to see some he-men come by now
and then to serve as protectors

  gyp did not see the look of fury
which swept over the usually smiling
face of his partner neither of them
saw the hard glint which came into the
eyes of the old conductor who in utter
silence took it all in

  when he had finished eating old bill
shoved back the cracker box on which
the girl at loup garou



 he sat fished out the short-stemmed
 pipe loaded it lighted it

   theres something perhaps i
 should tell you boys he said slowly
 he looked first at terry then at gyp

    out with it major gyp com-
 manded

   removing the pipe bill pointed the
 stem at his rear brakeman

    maybe you should know he said
 softly  that if you want to be happy
 and popular on this railroad youd bet-
 ter watch vour step down around loup
 garou

   he arose abruptly and walked to the
 desk terry grinned broadly

   you mean the canyon ghost he
 queried

   i mean marie gaston bill
 looked at gyp not at terry

    marie gaston

   gyps brown eyes came up in inno-
 cent questioning terry flushed

    yes marie gaston the girl op-
 erator at the loup

    oh oh gyp breathed the excla-
 mation arched his brows and looked at
 the conductor  relative of yours is
 she general

  the old man flushed with what
 was an apparent effort to control him-
 self he turned to answer

    not exactly shes ranse gastons
 kid

    dont believe i know ranse gyp
 replied

    you dont he disappeared before
 your time

    disappeared  gyp smirked at
 terry who was not grinning

    yes disappeared the old con-
 ductor dropped down on the cracker
 box and hitched it back to the table

    sounds like another ghost story
 laughed gyp  is it 

   no old bill snapped the answer
  same one

gyp flipped a fag into the coal hod
and fished out another cigarette
terry rolled his own the short-
stemmed pipe was dead but bill did
not relight it he stretched both arms
across the table in front of him played
with the piece of wood his eyes took
on a far-away look

    i ran a work train on this job dur-
ing construction he began in a low
tone  old ranse gaston-that was
maries grandfather-had the job on
the big trestle the one three miles be-
low loup garou his camp was in the
spruce grove below the trestle we
heard lots about the ghosts in the can-
yon old ranse scoffed at them so
did all of us for that matter we never
believed the stuff young ranse had
his wife with him marie was born
down there in the construction camp
 that so  gyp interrupted pur-
posely

   yes three days after she was
born we buried mrs gaston under the
cliff edge that was in february
young ranse almost went wild a
few days later old ranse was working
over the gorge his foot slipped off an
icy timber

  the conductor paused looked from
the window

   three hundred feet is a long
drop he added  and old ranse had
no wings

  gyp was still smiling but somehow
the smile had lost its meaning

    after the road was built bill con-
tinued  young ranse took a job brak-
ing seemed like he could never bring
hisself to leave this canyon where
everything he had except the kid was
buried he brought her swedish
grandparents down-he had married a
swedish girl-and settled them at the
mouth of the canyon

    thirteen years ago this fall ranse


railroad stories

took the job working rear end for me
he wasnt worth a damn as a brake-
man never was but-well we all
knew he had the kid to look after you
know

   one night in february the seven-
teenth i remember we got a car off the
track going down the canyon there
was a lumber train following us ranse
went back flagging  

   did he- terry began in an awed
tone

   he never came back hoghead on
the lumber train said he hit one torpedo
in the middle of the long trestle he
stopped we went back to find ranse
we found the handle of a pocket knife
on a bridge timber the blade was
broken out of it there was a few
drops of blood on the snow they led
straight toward the grave under the
cliff we never found ranse

  wolves queried gyp

  the old man shook his head slowly
solemnly

   wolves dont eat bones and cloth-
ing no it wasnt wolves brass hats
figgered maybe ranse had jumped off
into the gorge sixty feet of snow in
it not a chance to find him until
spring and there was a landslide that
winter

  terry would have asked other ques-
tions gyp uttered a laugh which had
no mirth in it

   i didnt aim to tell you boys this
tale old bill concluded  what i
started out to say is that the girl at the
loup is ranse gastons kid she took
the job when the war started fate
put her here in this damned hole to
issue train orders shes young and
shes good looking she may not be
sophisticated but shes got a helluva lot
of friends on this division

  old bill buttoned the coat and
started out gyp called after him

   thanks for the tip grandpa then
he turned to terry again he was smil-
ing the wise knowing smile  cest
le loup garou he quoted

  gyp played solitaire terry washed
the dishes all the while he kept think-
ing of the girl

at the end of the next trip gyp
- scott laid off with a sprained
ankle terry was entitled to work the
rear in his stead but he did not want
to always he had followed the en-
gine he did not feel at home around
a caboose

  besides he did not like bill gra-
ham what the old man had said about
marie terry had taken to himself he
resented interference with his first love
affair he was certain he would not
like this old bird who spoke only to
bawl a brakeinan out	m

  consequently when he came to work
that night he sent the extra man to the
caboose and he went to the roundhouse
for the engine the conductor and the
head brakeman were both there when
he coupled on old bill took the short-
stemmed pipe from a thin mouth and
pointed it at terry

   i want you to work the rear to-
night obrien he said shortly
yeah id rather-

   i dont give a damn what youd
rather i want you on the rear

  terry coupled the air and went to the
caboose before the night was done he
was glad he had

  all the way to sleepy valley the con-
ductor sat in the cupola and smoked
while terry sat there and whistled
they did not exchange a dozen words
on the hundred miles

  the return trip began in the same
manner it was  am when they
emerged from the tunnel terry turned
up his retainers and went back half
the girl at loup garou



way to the caboose they dropped
slowly down the long hill when they
came in sight of loup garou he went
to the left side of the train and sat
on the roof of a box car

  the order board was green the
light in the office was burning marie
gaston was out with her lantern terry
lifted his lamp and yelled 

   hello kid

  she wagged hers and yelled back

  terry grinned and a genial glow
thrilled his being immediately he be-
gan thinking that if he ever got a
chance to make love to that little daugh-
ter of the loup old bill grahams
warning would not have much effect

  the freight rolled on down the hill
brakes growling flanges squealing
soon it crossed the high trestle where
the track crosses from the north side of
the canyon this was the trestle built
of many lengths of heavy timbers in-
tricately woven together and was more
than  feet high as they ran off it
terry felt a sudden shock which told
him the engineer had set brakes

  a moment later the whistle sounded
-a long blast and three short ones-
calling out a flagman from the rear
terry hurried to the caboose to get his
flagging equipment he met graham
on the caboose platform

  have you a gun the old man
asked

   hell no what use does a brake-
man have for a gun

  youd better get one if you aim to
work this job

   bunk

  old bill went toward the engine
terry walked back up the track

while he walked he whistled
and while he whistled he wished
for an excuse to go back into loup
garou

   damn shame this couldnt have
happened three miles up the hill he
grumbled  if it had-

  he peered into the black shadows
among the trees the shadows seemed
to be moving the canyon was lonely
voices were whispering and the whis-
per was echoing through the depths
terry told himself it vtfas the wind
among the trees what else could it
be the place was utterly deserted
and he was utterly alone

  at the end of twenty minutes the
head brakeman came walking rapidly
up the track

   theres a coupla boulders down
there in the middle of the track he
told terry  one of ems big as a
house if wed gone ten feet further
wed sloughed into them cap said for
you to flag back into the loup an order
out the hook

   back into the loup terrys in-
credulous heart was pounding

   sure back into the loup

  terry started toward the station he
whistled most of the way he tried to
figure out some things he could say to
marie gaston he wondered how long
it would be before he had her in his
arms

  the moment he came in sight of
loup garou he knew something was
wrong there what it was he could not
at first determine finally he decided
the order board light was not burning
that however was no cause for alarm
order board lights often go out during
the night

  he hurried into the office it was
empty the little operator was gone
he called there was no answer in
alarm he dashed to the platform he
called again still no answer he
looked off through the trees where he
knew the day operator lived in a little
cottage


railroad stories

  then he saw something lying in the
middle of the track he strode to it and
picked it up it was a skeleton frame
lantern like the one he was carrying
the guards were bent and the globe
was broken it was still warm

  terry looked uneasily around
finally he looked up and uttered an ex-
clamation of surprise twenty feet
above the platform on the narrow steel
ladder going to the top of the sema-
phore he could see something silhouet-
ted against the sky

  terry opened his mouth to call he
snapped it quickly shut it suddenly
dawned upon him that marie gaston
had climbed the ladder to light her
semaphore lamp and had not come
down

  heart pounding he started up the
ladder the thin steel slats wobbled
the figure far up above was jostling
it looked as if his every step might
loosen it and send it crashing to the
platform

  at the top he found her in the
frantic struggle with fading conscious-
ness she had thrust one leg between two
rungs of the ladder and locked her
arms into the cold steel thus she was
clinging to the steps

terry released her took her under
his arm like a sack of feathers and
descended to the platform quickly en-
tering the door he placed her on a long
bench and knelt beside her she blinked
up helplessly into his grinning face he
didnt know what to do

   what happened  he queried

   i-went up the ladder to light the
lamp i guess i must have-fainted

  tears were slipping out of her blue
eyes and down over the white face in
the presence of tears terry was
helpless

   be careful where you faint next

time little girl he advised  there
wasnt no feather bed at the foot of
that ladder

  he tried to comfort her often he
had seen gyp comforting women when
they cried gyp always put his arms
about them terry tried to put his big
arms about her she shoved him away
stumbled to her chair and dropped
into it

  for two or three seconds terry
looked on in pained silence finally he
went to the platform climbed the lad-
der lighted her semaphore lamp
when he came down she was waiting
for him

   im-im sorry i acted so rude
she said penitently  i must have
been-

   oh thats all right kid he an-
swered he wondered girls were
never rude to gyp

  she looked up into his face his
strong arms fairly ached to comfort
her instead he led her into the office
had her order the wrecker and re-
mained with her until no i came down
an hour later

  terry did not mention the occur-
rence to bill graham nor to anyone
else for that matter but the next
night as they dragged up through the
canyon old bill tamped a load in the
short-stemmed pipe and called to
terry

   hear you happened along at the
loup last night just in time obrien

   maybe

  terry flushed and lighted a cigarette
the old man was silent for five miles
finally he leaned over removed the
pipe and pointed the stem at terry

   maries a good kid obrien he
said slowly

  terry did not say he knew it he
said yeah

  the old man squinted at him for a
the girl at loup garou



long time shrugged and climbed down
to the desk

while gyp was off the car terry
made the most of his opportunity
when he stopped at the loup he went
into the office he was timid his part-
ner had been looking after the women
so long that he had never learned how

  last trip before gyp returned he be-
gan making a little headway they
took siding at the loup to meet a
couple of deadhead equipment trains
terry looked at the rear of his train
hurriedly and beat the head brakeman
into the office marie smiled sweetly
terry sat on the table beside her let-
ting his leg dangle as he had often
seen gyp do but he felt uncomfortable

  sne stretched out a hand on the
table admiring a new wrist watch
terry beamed he had slept and eaten
on the caboose for two weeks and
would have to do so two weeks more
to pay for that watch he had sent it
to her yesterday anonymously

   looks like somebodys got some
new jewelry he remarked

   uh-huh isnt it cute 

  she held up the watch for his in-
spection

    ill say

  under pretense of inspecting the
watch terry captured the hand she
did not take it away

   someone sent it to me from devils
gateway she informed

   really

  terrys blue eyes gleamed so she
knew he had sent it did she his
heart thumped and battered hope was
high-too high he closed both big

hands over the little one the little
one was not drawn away

  he looked down into the blue eyes
in them was a mischievous twinkle
terry saw the twinkle but he was not
good at reading eyes he was afraid if
he moved the spell might be broken

  away back at the rear bill grahams
light was coming forward in a mo-
ment now-

  marie probably saw the lantern too
she looked up into terrys eager face
with the same merriment in her shining
eyes

   id-sure like to know who sent
it she whispered

   dont you-have any idea terry
opened his mouth twice before he could
voice the question

  again the blue eyes danced

   no she said frowning  unless
it was that handsome partner of
yours

  terry stiffened the grin froze
without bending his head he looked
down the mischievous twinkle was
gone from the eyes

  terry dropped her hand like a hot
potato grabbed his lantern and strode
from the office slamming the door be-
hind him

   so thats the way of it huh he
snarled  thinks gyp sent it damn
these women anyhow then he re-
called the twinkle recalled the soft feel
of the hand in his and the look in her
eyes  maybe-maybe she was just
tryin to kid me

  just what might have happened is
not at all certain perhaps the budding
romance would have blossomed before
winter closed down had it not been for
another affair

it was late october tinge of frost
was in the air winter would soon
be coming in dead earnest cold


railroad stories

though it was gyp and terry having
turned up their retainers were sitting
side by side on a box car watching the
scenery pass they rolled down
through the loup crossed the trestle
where ranse gaston had disappeared

  terry was thinking about ranse
and the girl ranse had left behind he
had not mentioned his infatuation to
gyp he wondered if he should gyp
had always discussed love affairs with
him but gyp had never been serious

  the train threaded through the
 needles eye  at the lower end of
the haunted canyon and came out upon
a delta built by debris from the canyon
across the narrow valley of the grande

  groves of spruce dotted this delta
interspersed with white stemmed pop-
lar and birch under one of these
spruce groves a hundred yards or less
from the track was a little mountain
ranch layout it consisted of log house
log stables for cows and ponies and a
tightly built log lean-to for the
poultry

  it was the first time either of the
boys had noticed the place closely in
the daylight even now they did not
know that marie gaston lived here
with her grandparents neither did
they know that in the stable at the rear
was pinto the spotted pony on which
she rode to and from the station four
miles up the canyon

  her grandmother was in the chicken
yard throwing corn to the flock of
white wyandottes

  gyp eyed the roughly clad feminine
figure terry eyed the pullets a broad
grin spread over his face

   look at the blond chickens would
yuh he said admiringly

  the train wound down the valley
woman house and chickens disap-
peared a moment after they had
gone gyp turned to terry

   yuh know kid he suggested  if
sometimes when were cornin up this
hill after dark youd drop off the head
end and make a sashay over to that hen
roost and back we could sure have
one swell mess of fried chicken

   you said an idea agreed terry
 leave it to me

  terry did not stop to reckon that the
flock of chickens meant life itself to the
old couple who raised them more than
once as a youth in the hills of arkansas
he had gone possum hunting with his
gang and had wound up by helping
stage a chicken roast around a hickory
wood fire in his philosophy taking
chickens from a roost like taking
watermelons from a patch was not
stealing it was having a little fun with
the neighbors

next trip out the crew was called
for  pm they had plenty of
tonnage and one helper engine for the
hill since they cooked on the caboose
and since terry was chef he often
dropped back to prepare a midnight
lunch on the run up through the loup
garou

  this night was cold and still with a
cloud curtain hanging low and a scurry
of snow flying through the valley
after old bill left the caboose terry
called out to gyp

   this is the night were going to
eat fried chicken

   sounds good to me gyp an-
swered with a grin  you fetch on a
couple an ill have the water hot
terry stuffed a flour sack into his
hip pocket and went to get the en-
gine on

  old bill graham rode the engine
that night because they were going to
be on short time against no  at the
loup he did not ask any questions
when terry dropped off the head end
the girl at loup garou



at the ranch brakemen often drop off
the head end and let a train run up a
grade by them looking for dragging
beams and sticking brakes

  as soon as the engine had gone out
of sight terry snuffed his lantern
eased over the pole fence and hurried
to the chicken house

  the old couple were sound asleep
there was not a sound as terry had
expected the door was not locked in
less time than it takes to tell it terry
had gone inside had selected a couple of
plump pullets slipped them quietly into
the flour sack and was making his way
back to the train there was not a
hitch the caboose clanked by going
six miles an hour terry swung up the
platform and deposited his load

   get em queried gyp

   you tell em 

  terry opened the sack gyp peeked
inside a pullet chattered gyp
chuckled

  	you fix em ill go over an head
us in at the loup tonights the
night

  no  went down it stopped at the
loup that was unusual passengers
for the loup were few and far be-
tween terry wondered while he
wondered he butchered the white pul-
lets

  now if there had been any guilt in
his heart terry would never have
brought those chickens into old bill
grahams caboose in the second place
if he had felt the least bit guilty he
would have thrown out the pan of
feathers before the old man came in
he did not

  as they headed out the conductor
caught the rear platform terry knew
the moment he hit the step that some-
one was with him he had been grin-
ning all the while thinking about the
blond chickens and the blond girl

who within the hour would be on duty
at the station

he started when a man with a bear-
skin coat preceded the conductor
into the caboose immediately he rec-
ognized the visitor as superintendent
lawson who often rode the freights
with his men

  the official looked about the neat
caboose and said with a friendly grin

   fried chicken for supper ill bet

  yes sir

  terrys freckled face flushed

  old bill said nothing he looked at
the flour sack which lay on the locker
at the white feathers in the aluminum
dishpan then he looked at terry

   where did you get those chick-
ens he asked

  terry caught his breath it suddenly
dawned upon him that some folks
might not approve he did not lie

  why-i-got em-back at the
ranch house on the delta he answered

  the old man eyed him reproachfully
lawson turned terry was standing
beside the table a chicken leg in one
hand a butcher knife in the other

   whats the trouble graham 
asked the superintendent

   my brakeman here has so far for-
gotten himself as to steal chickens
from a coop

  the old man glowered at terry
then he turned from him to the rear
platform to watch the train run out a
guilty flush spread over the brakemans
face

  lawson stopped squarely in front of
him rocked on the balls of his feet and
chewed the butt of a cigar the
officials countenance was serious he
seemed to be studying the culprit

   know the old folks down there
terry lawson asked

   nu-no sir returned terry


railroad stories

   wanna tell yuh a little story kid 
lawson removed the cigar and held it
between thumb and second finger
terry lifted his head and with an effort
brought his eyes to meet those of the
official

  briefly the super sketched the
tragedy which had in the building of
the line driven grandma and grandpa
colson to settle on this remote delta

  a big lump came up in terrys
throat he had never in any way con-
nected marie gaston with the little
ranch down there in the grove and
the way lawson told the tale stressing
the life of sacrifice they had lived in
order that the daughter of an unfor-
tunate railroad couple might be clothed
and fed made terry feel like the mean-
est sort of criminal

  a moment after lawson had fin-
ished gyp who had closed the passing
track switch came- in he was
whistling

  hows the feed podner he
queried

   o k  reckon muttered terry

  gyp looked searchingly at him but
asked no questions terry was glad of
it when the meal was ready terry
called the others and volunteered to
watch the train while they ate when
they had finished he himself came
down he managed to get outside some
gravy the chicken he could not
touch all the way in visions of marie
gaston and of the old couple who lived
in the grove kept flashing before him

  the superintendent did not again
mention the matter neither did the
conductor

  while he was in devils gateway
terry tucked a five-dollar bill into an
envelope composed a note of apology
which he planned to leave that night
where he had got the chickens before
sealing the envelope he told gyp about

the chickens and the old folks and
read the note to him

  gyp took it all as a huge joke

   dont let it git yuh down kid
gyp urged  nobodyll ever miss a
coupla chickens out of a flock like
that

but in this surmise gyp was mis-
taken grandma colson knew
every chicken in her flock first thing
next morning she missed the two pul-
lets she hurried in to tell grandpa
she repeated the tale when marie came
home from work she repeated it again
when sergeant walton of the mounties
stopped in on his way to devils gate-
way to see how the old couple were
faring

  they all went out to inspect the
roost the sergeant laid some plans
and that night when he returned from
devils gateway he hooked up a tiell
and a battery and wires which would
help put those plans into effect

  terry unaware that the trap had
been set for him hopped off the engine
passing the clearing quietly he slipped
over the pole fence and opened the door
of the roost there was not a sound of
movement he could not hear the gen-
tle buzz of the bell in maries bedroom
he felt around for something on which
to hang the envelope

  suddenly he heard a step and a
frightened voice quavering

   pu-pu-pu-put up your hands

  terry knew the voice there could
be no mistaking it looking quickly
around he saw the glint of starlight on
steel he did not question  he lifted his
hands above his head and held them
there in one of them was crumpled
the envelope

  by this time he could hear footsteps
moving in the house the kitchen door
opened and grandma colson shiver-
the girl at loup garou



ing in the cold of the mountain night
was holding a lantern

   come in here the voice said

  it was steadier now it was becom-
ing imperative

  terry obeyed he moved toward the
light he thought how easy it would
be to floor the old lady and spring away
into the night he did not do it grand-
ma colson stepped back to let him pass
her marie came in behind holding the
gun in his ribs he could feel it shak-
ing

  they went on into the kitchen the
stove was warm marie closed the
door grandma lifted the lantern she
looked at him

   i guess well keep you here tonight
an turn you over to the mounties in the
morning sir she said sternly

  she lifted the lantern and its beams
fell on terrys face marie started
back the gun wavered came slowly
to her side

  you she whispered incredulous-
ly  you-why-

  she stammered choked and burst
out sobbing

   oh i never dreamed- she
turned to grandma colson  we-we
cant do it she whispered  we-we
-hes the young man who kept me
from falling off the ladder

  the old woman looked again

  terry licked his lips and the grin
came back to his face he put his hands
down thrust the envelope in his pocket

  im sorry marie he whispered
 im-

   go way she sobbed  go way
and dont ever speak to me again

  terry backed slowly out of the door
the sound of crying followed him
echoed in his ears all through the four
mile walk to the loup garou to catch
the train which had gone off and left
him it kept echoing in his heart for

weeks afterward and every echo was
like the thrust of a knife in his soul

if the story had leaked out terry
would never have been able to re-
main on the job but it did not train-
men do not talk gratitude for his serv-
ice to marie sealed the lips of the old
couple marie herself did not speak
of it

  even so terry felt humiliated he
was for pulling the pin on the job and
returning to the states gyp was not
ready to go when terry broached the
subject there was reason why he
should stay it did not take an expert
to tell what that reason was terry
knew so did bill graham terry did
not go into maries office he often
went by and always gyp was sitting on
the table with a leg dangling more
than once terry saw a black head close
to a blond one saw two pairs of hands
where only one should be

  always terry could feel the soft
touch of that hand in his could remem-
ber that it had not been withdrawn he
grew glum almost sullen gyp smirked
and whistled and terry though he
tried to smother the feeling tried to
blame himself rather than his partner
felt a cold contempt growing within
him

  as the winter closed in they began
hearing things about the canyon a
fireman had seen green eyes watching
at night from the timber a brakeman
flagging the loup garou had heard
noises below the trestle another had
found tracks in the snow-enormous
tracks by the time the tale went the
rounds old pierre le grande smok-


railroad stories

ing in the lobby of the rooming house
in devils gateway wagged a knowing
head and whispered ominously

   cest le loup garou

  terry muttered  bunk

  gyp did not comment for he was
hard and experienced but he had been
born and reared in the ozark hills his
father had carried a rabbits foot and
a buckeye and had planted his potatoes
in the light of the moon his mother
had turned coffee cups and conjured
warts and whooping cough his chums
had in darkness passed graveyards
tremblingly had seen things when they
passed and believed what they saw

  gyp bought a  and kept it on his
hip terry saw the gun and he sneer-
ingly asked if it was loaded with silver
bullets scott flushed and chewed his
nine-on-a-side but he never left the
caboose day or night without the re-
volver

  christmas was near bitter cold
made railroading in the canadian
rockies a man-sized job ice froze
thick on running boards ice daggers
hung from tank and engine the track
was a solid glare those who had been
long on the job warned those who had
not to move cautiously

  watch your step boys old bill
warned his brakemen  dont take
chances especially down the loup
garou men have gone out and not
come back

  one night terry was called east
shortly after midnight with a train of
cattle all the way up the grade the
load seemed dragging heavily terry
who was riding the head engine
guessed the rear one was not steaming
running through the canyon the engi-
neer called him over

   how much tonnage we got 

  according to legend the loup garou was
 immune to all but silver bullets

   nineteen hundred

   well we got some brakes draggin
back there if thats all

   maybe id better drop off goin up
through the loup an look em over
 i hate to ask it slick as it is out
but im afraid youd better ifwe dont
get a let-up were going to stick on the
upper hill

terry dropped off at the lower
switch at loup garou he could
see the green gleam of marie gastons
order board he watched the train run
by him near the middle of it a car
was banging up and down with brakes
stuck tight and wheels running hot

  he opened the bleed cock and ran
alongside the car until the brakes re-
leased but immediately they went on
again the hiss of escaping air was
audible terry knew it was coming
from a leak in the branch pipe the
only way to remedy it was to crawl
under the car cut out the air and then
release it

  terry was no student he knew that
crawling under that car in the ice was
a ticklish job nevertheless he swung
in under it on the truss rods turned the
cut-out cock and started backing out

  the car was then even with the sta-
tion the train was picking up speed
on the platform he was feeling for his
footing out of the tail of his eye he
caught a gleam of another lantern the
thought shot through his mind that
marie was watching the train rim by

  his pulse quickened and the dull
ache in his heart began he slid from
under the car even with the spot where
she was standing

  just what happened during the next
few seconds none was ever ble to de-
termine the platform wns slippery
terry was numb with cold his mind
was certainly on the girl his feet
the girl at loup garou



struck the platform slipped from under
him sent him stumbling headlong

  he grabbed for a truss rod his hand
grazed it and before he knew what
happened he plunged head down into
the tracks

  marie screamed then ran around the

a frantic stop sign the instant the
caboose passed she sprang into the
track and knelt beside terry she
grabbed his face and rubbed it with her
soft hands he was not hurt but he did
not try to get up for a moment

 in that moment gyp rushed out

curve trying to get a signal to the engi-
neer he could not see her the train
roared on up the grade

  fortunately terry had the presence
of mind to lie still had he scrambled
he would have been cut to mince meat
he flattened himself in the track the
train dragged over him he expected a
low brake beam from every car that
passed to catch him and end his life
fortunately he was lying in a hollow
if the tracks had been blocked with
snow as they usually were-

  when the caboose came over marie
was crying gyp and old bill had
heard her had seen her lantern waving

jerked open the tail hose and hit the
platform terry began struggling to
his feet with marie helping him gyp
came between them and helped both
hurt he asked his partner

  naw terry answered of
course not

  gyp turned to marie put both arms
about her

 there there he soothed  dont
you see hes all right not a scratch
marie tried to struggle loose gyp
held her close old bill graham came
down the track

  whats goin on here he de-
manded


railroad stories

   aw i climbed under a car to cut
out a stickin brake an lost my footin
when i started out

   well dont ever try that trick
again next time stop the train and
fix it

  terry turned and strode toward the
engine gyp was still holding marie

a week or two after new years

	gyp laid off for a trip terry
asked no questions but when that
night gyp rode with him to the loup
garou a bitter resentment gnawed at
his heart mentally tracing back
through the years he recalled the dif-
ferent girls for whom gyp had laid off

  terry brought himself together with
a start his mind flashed to another
night down below muskogee a
wrecked oil train had been burning
they had all left him-all but gyp a
blur came before his vision in it he
could see marie gaston and gyp scott
-together in the lonely station at loup
garoiv

  terry had a talk with gyp that
morning previously it had been none
of his business it was hard to begin
now they were in the siding at silver
cliff

   yuh know gyp terry began
haltingly  i wish youd lay off the
little girl up at the loup

  gyp smiled

   you mean my little marie

   sure

   whats the matter afraid the old
man might-

  he looked up startled as if a
thought had struck him  you dont
mean youre in love with her

  terry was not smiling his face was
lined with misery he nodded

   yuh see gyp i thought maybe-i
-but i was a fool of course

  the smile left gyps face

   im sorry kid he soothed
 sorry as hell but you see- the
smile was coming back  shes crazy
about me she wouldnt look at another
guy

   i know terry broke in bitterly
 theyre all crazy about you they
dont give a damn for me

  just then bill graham shoved open
the caboose door

   were following number five out
obrien shell be due in twelve
minutes

this trip and others became his-
tory tales of the canyon grew in
grimness and in number the wolf
pack was back on its beat it was weeks
earlier than usual this year the prac-
tical people merely wondered why the
superstitious groped for sinister
motives

  maybe the loup garou was on a
mission of mercy-or revenge maybe
the leader was the soul of ranse
gaston  or of young ranse

  and immediately the leader had be-
come young ranse gaston he had
returned to save his orphaned daughter
from the clutches of the boomer some
night-

  terry obrien heard the rumors
and muttered his incredulous
 bunk

  gyp scott heard them-and exam-
ined the 

  on the night of february thirteenth
grahams crew was ordered west out
of sleepy valley on no  at silver
cliff they took siding as usual to let
no  by them and followed her out of
the block with a deadhead equipment
train behind them

  old bill and terry were on the
grouch they had not spoken a dozen
words to gyp or to each other on the
whole round trip scott had spent the

                            	r
the girl at loup garou



last four days hanging around loup
garou there had been ugly threats
and uglier rumors

  gyp himself was in no angelic mood
for once he had met resistance from a
woman-unexpected resistance

  no  eased through the tunnel
gyp helped turn up retainers terry
did not come on back to visit with him
after the last one was turned up he
went toward the engine while gyp
went toward the caboose a mile above
the station they ran over two torpe-
does the engineer whistled a little
farther on a red fusee waved them
down the engineer called for a flag-
man gyp was already going to the
caboose for his equipment

  he met bill heading for the engine
the conductor did not speak gyp was
running for he knew the deadhead
equipment train was only ten minutes
behind them he would have to hurry
while he was in the caboose he exam-
ined the  every chamber was
loaded

  the night was cold and cloudy the
gorge of the loup garou was a pit of
blackness not a gleam of light came
from earth or sky save the ghastly
glow of the markers

  the caboose had stopped on a sharp
curve in a rock cut a few telegraph
poles away the markers were lost to
view gyp ran for he knew there was
no time to lose and while he ran he
kept glancing from side to side the
black wall of the forest hedged him in
two hundred yards from the caboose
he heard the long drawn howl of a lobo
wolf the howl was taken up from a
dozen throats it sounded dead ahead
gyp quit running he glanced back
he was alone-alone in the haunted
canyon

  haltingly he moved forward peer-
ing into the night not a thing was

   	r

visible the howl came again wild
weird echoing from a thousand crags
until the gorge was full of it

  he recalled the tales of the loup
garou    the old tales and the new
ones he had never believed them but
had not strange things happened in this
canyon had not ranse gaston dis-
appeared out flagging out flagging
just as he was tonight

  suppose there was something to it
suppose ranse had come back he
remembered that ranses daughter was
down at the lonely office

  pie looked longingly down the can-
yon he wanted to flee to the safety of
the caboose but a train was follow-
ing-following close he was not yet
far enough away to protect the rear
end of his own train

moistening his lips he started
on again haltingly falteringly
before he had gone a dozen steps the
weird sound came again

  again gyp stopped in his left hand
he held a torpedo with the straps
opened in his right he clutched the 
the lanterns were on his elbow keep-
ing his eyes fixed ahead he stooped to
fasten the torpedo to the rail

  from the forest on the left came a
crashing thrashing sound he jerked
his head to peer toward it a scant
twenty yards away two balls of fire
were gleaming close together

  his heart stopped the balls of fire
moved forward reflected in the gleam
of his lantern was the flash of white-
something which rose and fell the
thing moved from the forest to the
middle of the right-of-way

  in gyps trembling grasp the 
came up the hammer fell with a dull
click the first shell had missed fire
close on the left the forest wall was
studded with balls of glistening fire


railroad stories

gyp tried to cry out no sound came
then suddenly as if the thing had
been but waiting for reinforcements
it arose in air and came hurtling toward
him he shrank backward stumbled
fell beside the track and lay still and
at that moment the headlight of the
train for which he had waited plowed
around the curve

  the engineer struck the lone torpedo
gyp had planted he stopped his en-
gine nose against the tail lights of bill
grahams caboose men rushed back
to search for the flagman they found
him lying close beside the track he
was not dead nor even hurt but he was
in a daze

  serious-faced men found the gun
with a shell which had missed fire
they carried him into the pullman and
rushed him to devils gateway

  practical men sought tracks in the
canyon they found that a deer had
come into the right-of-way had stamped
about in the snow had leaped the track
and disappeared they found that a
pack of two dozen timber wolves had
come to the edge of the forest follow-
ing the deer-and had slunk back into
the fastness the practical ones re-
membered that a swallow deer when
running carries a white flag which looks
 spooky in the lamp light the prac-
tical ones chuckled

 old pierre le grande did not
chuckle he shook his head and whis-
pered

thirteen years to a day i

for a couple of days gyp scott
stayed away from the railroad
stayed away from marie he told

terry in no uncertain terms that he
was pulling the pin to head for warmer
climes terry argued with him at first
but in the end agreed hed make one
more trip when his turn came tonight
and would quit when he got back
theyd hit the train again that was
on february sixteenth thirteen years
to a day since ranse gaston had dis-
appeared

  terry was called for a manifest old
bill was surprised to see him

  you back on the car obrien
the conductor queried

   naw snapped terry  im in
saint louis

  old bill grunted and went out

  they took siding at loup garou for
no i terry went into the office why
he could not have said perhaps to get
one more look into the face of marie
gaston before he left her forever
marie was not on duty he casually
inquired of the extra operator who had
taken her place

   shes down home now i believe
the latter told him  her grand-
fathers very ill she had to lay off

   oh terry went on back to his
caboose

  the next night they were called east
on no 

  they made the run to loup garou
without mishap the operator was out
with a lantern he waved terry
waved they went past the station at
 somewhere below terry saw an
object moving down the trail it
looked f like a horse with a rider
he wondered few came into the can-
yon on horseback

  the train ran over the high trestle
the trestle whence old ranse gaston
had plunged from an icy timber in con-
struction days and where young
ranse gaston had left a knife with a
blade broken from it
  they ran on down through the nar-
row lane between the alaska spruces
they passed the delta where ranse
gastons wife had been laid away nine-
teen years ago terry looked out that
way and remembered that just beyond
the screen of trees was a grave kept by
the colsons and marie gaston

  it was just below the grave that
something happened what it was
terry did not know at the moment he
felt the air go into the emergency and
felt the jostle and jam as cars rammed
down from above he did not know
that the engine had left the rails and
that matt mulcahey was trying to stop

before he would turn turtle into the
river

  terry listened looked toward the
rear twelve cars away he could see
the green glow of a marker while he
was watching the engine whistle broke
into the whispering echoes of the can-
yon calling out a flagman with a
shrug terry turned and hurried over
the top halfway to the rear he met
old bill graham

   know whats wrong boy  the
conductor queried

   not the slightest idea terry an-
swered

  old bill looked at his watch a
frown creased his forehead

 i presume youll have to go back
he said

sure ill go back terry an-
swered  any reason
why i shouldnt

 do you have a
gun

terry laughed

 never owned one
in me life he said
 my fists   

 wolves have been

a scant twenty
yards away two
bails of fire were
gleaming

seen in the canyon recently the con-
ductor broke in  my s in the sta-
tionery drawer you take it

   is it loaded with silver bullets 
terry asked quickly

  the conductor flushed but did not
laugh

   dont be foolish boy he warned
 take the gun and keep your eyes
open

  old bill went forward and terry
went back slipping into the cupola
through the side window he dropped
down to the floor the stove was
glowing he stretched out his hands
toward the warmth beside the door
the red light sat on the neatly scrubbed
floor terry looked at the bail four
torpedoes were fastened where he had
put them on leaving the terminal he
picked up the lantern lifted two fusees
from the rack overhead slipped them
spikes up in his right hip pocket and
stepped out to the rear platform he
had not taken the gun

down at the colson ranch grand-
pas checkered life was drawing
to its close marie moved softly to
and fro since nightfall the old man
had grown rapidly worse uneasily the
two women watched listened to the
tightening cough to the labored breath-
ing ten oclock came and eleven
grandma called marie into the kitchen

  if we only had a doctor she said
 he might do something

   i-i can get him marie whis-
pered fearfully

   child you wouldnt dare youd
have to ride alone to loup garou and
call him

   i know but i can do it the girl
answered bravely  ive ridden it
twice a day for the last six months and
more

   but not at night

   pinto knows the road

   but the wolves

   im not afraid

  she lied bravely during the last
weeks while she had been riding to the
loup in the early evening she had been
frightened within an inch of her life
she tried to still the wild beating of her
heart

  at  she went to the barn sad-
dled pinto and led him through the
gate he snorted uneasily but the girl
did not heed she mounted and rode
up the canyon

  ever since she had been working at
loup garou she had ridden up in the
evening and down in the morning
spending part of her off hours at the
colsons and part of them with the day
operators wife at the loup it was a
lonely five-mile ride

  the trail was narrow it had not
been built for a bridle path it crossed
the chasm over the railroad bridge-
the bridge on which maries father had
disappeared pinto was the only horse
ever to have crossed it and he made it
by carefully picking his footing over
the ties often friends had warned
marie that some time his foot would
slip between the timbers that a train
would come down the hill and catch
them upon the bridge she had laughed
at their warning she thought of it
tonight as she wound up the trail
through the darkness

  pinto shied and snorted she fol-
lowed the trail to the trestle then
stopped to listen far up the gorge she
heard the whistle of no x she waited
the train came down headlight burn-
ing through the trees lights gleaming
from the pullmans

  when it had gone she did not wait
for she knew no train would come from
the west for a long while nor from the
east for at least ten minutes
the girl at loup garou



  the ties were slippery where the
water dripping from the tanks of
many engines had frozen pinto
moved cautiously a misstep would
send him to death and her with him
but pinto had crossed that bridge
many times he made it safely

  it was  when they arrived at
loup garou the operator sent a mes-
sage to the doctor in devils gateway
received an immediate reply he would
be on his way

   she waited by the stove she learned
that no  would soon be by and noth-
ing else till no 

  at  she started home no 
passed her on the curve above the
bridge a feeling of uneasiness came
over her this feeling was augmented
when from somewhere up the canyon
she heard the distant cry as of one
wolf calling others to the chase pinto
threw up his head and whinnied ahead
of hr lay the bridge-the bridge where
her grandfather had gone down to his
death where her father had gone back
flagging and left the hande of a broken
knife

  with beating heart she urged the
pinto up the grade urged him out upon
the icy structure and behind her the
eager cries of a wolf pack filled the
canyon

meanwhile as terry swung
down to the ground something
caused him to halt abruptly it might
have been the sound of a boulder cata-
pulting from high up on the canyon
wall it might have been reason it
might have been the thing called hunch

  he returned to the platform sheep-
ishly opened the door took old bills
 hefted it slipped it into the right
pocket of his mackinaw and put a
handful of shells in with it thus
armed he left the caboose and trudged

back up the track flagging the loup
garou

  terry was not afraid he had never
known what it meant to be afraid but
all the way he felt a sort of sinking sen-
sation in the pit of his stomach

  once he heard the distant cry of a
timber wolf he stopped to listen but
only the echoed cry came from cliff to
cliff and died away into silence he
crossed the delta where the side canyon
emptied into the loup unconsciously
he quickened his step but he did not
do a job of short flagging he counted
off the twenty telegraph poles required
by rule and planted two torpedoes on
the north rail

  the upper one was at the lower end
of the long trestle he looked up the
canyon above the trestle he saw two
balls of fire flash once flash again and
disappear he looked a long while but
the eyes did not again appear finally
he turned back down the track at the
point where the trail went into the strip
of forest he stopped

  the snow was ruffled he looked
more closely on the trail leading onto
the trestle were tracks-two kinds of
them one was made by a solid hoof
he looked more closely often he had
seen the tracks of marie gastons pony
going out on the bridge these he
knew were pintos tracks and they
were not many hours old a puzzled
frown swept over his face

  why had marie gaston gone to the
loup tonight she was laying off
her grandfather was ill he recalled
the moving object which he had seen
on the trail as he came down

  he looked at the tracks again the
other tracks looked like dog tracks
there were many of them as if many
dogs had gone up the trail in places
they had completely obliterated the
tracks of the pony


railroad stories

  terry returned to the end of the
trestle and looked up the right-of-way
he could see nothing and the only
sound which hit his ears was the low
moan of the wind through the spruce
trees shifting both lanterns to his left
arm he left his right hand free to play
with the  in his pocket again he
wondered why marie gaston had gone
up the gorge tonight but there was no
answer

turning he trudged down the
trail for almost a quarter mile the
snow which had threatened since morn-
ing was beginning first a thin screen of
fine mist then flakes which grew larger
and larger he stopped to plant one
torpedo thirty minutes passed forty
he wondered what had gone wrong
with the train why he had not been
called in

  he stamped his feet and slapped his
palms together to keep up the circula-
tion he pulled off his right glove un-
buttoned his mackinaw and looked at
the watch it was  no  would
soon be due from the east he would
be glad when it came he listened

  and while he listened a sound came
-a wild weird unearthly scream
which sent goose pimples crawling
along his spine terry tried to place
it never in his life had he heard any-
thing like it it was not human it
sounded like the whinny of a horse in
pain or deadly terror and like the
scream of a panther on the rampage

  he looked down the track he fin-
gered the gun he looked up the track
prayed for the sound of a locomotive
whistle none came

  turning his head from side to side
he listened to the echoes which bounded
back and forth across the canyon he
could not determine whether the sound
had come from above or below or

whether it had come from the cliffs
high up toward the rimrock

  after a long while he heard the cry
repeated this time there was no doubt
about it it was coming from up the
track from up toward the trestle
again terry looked longingly in the
direction of the caboose just out of
sight a pair of welcome red tail lights
were gleaming he dared not go to
them no  was now past due be-
fore he could get to the caboose she
might come roaring down the grade
strike the torpedoes and seeing no
flag drift into his train on the curve
below

  a third time that weird cry came the
cry which he could not identify this
time before its echoes died out an-
other mingled with it there was no
mistaking this one it could come only
from a woman before its echoesdied
away to whispers other cries came
were augmented until they filled the
canyon-the howls of a wolf pack on
the run

  for many moments terry had been
thinking had been trying to connect
those cries with the track of the pinto
pony in the snow suddenly he realized
that marie gaston had gone to loup
garou and was returning he knew
that pinto had at last made the fatal
step and was down in the trestle

  still holding two lanterns in the
crook of his elbow he turned and
started running up that track again
and again the wolf cry was repeated
and the womans was louder he won-
dered if she were coming toward him

seconds passed the snow fell in
a heavier swirl he came to the
trestle out there upon it he could hear
the womans screams the unearthly
cries of the dying pony and all black
against the falling snow he could see
the girl at loup garou



the huddled heap with a pair of eyes
between him and it

  the eyes started toward him fre-
quently he had heard that wolves will
run from fire but the presence of his
lantern did not deter this gaunt form
it crept to meet him over the icy tim-
bers

  he stopped maybe it was not a
wolf the oft-repeated saying of old
pierre came to him terry flung the
thought from him muttered the one
word  bunk it did not sound con-
vincing now

  nearer nearer came the thing its
teeth bared terrys hand tightened on
the pistol grip slowly he advanced
the wolf did not retreat

  terry drew back the hammer lifted
the pistol the gaunt form was crouch-
ing it was a scant dozen feet away
just beyond it was the pied outline of
the pony threshing on the trestle near
it was the cowering figure of marie
gaston

  he looked at her since she was in
his line of fire he dared not shoot he
sidestepped toward the north the
beast sidestepped with him

  he lifted the weapon his hand
shook a trifle the barrel came in line
with gleaming eyes he crooked his
finger and the gun leaped and spat
flame the beast backed slowly away

  again he raised the weapon the
thing turned broadside to him again
his finger crooked and the gun leaped
fire streamed from it the thing ut-
tered a startled cry plunged toward
him he dodged it went over him
snarled kicked lay still between the
rails

  there was no time to lose now
terry whirled from the thing he had
killed to the huddled heap upon the
trestle he set his lanterns-on the tim-
ber

  he took marie in his arms lifted her
to her feet he looked toward the east
balls of fire were gleaming through the

darkness

  one glance at pinto confirmed his
first theory a nervous hoof had finally
missed its step and the pony was down
with a broken leg

   weve got to kill him he whis-
pered  we cant leave him here for
the wolves to eat alive

  marie sobbed pinto looked piteous-
ly up at them and while he looked
terry lifted the  and placed a slug
between his eyes

ihe pack snarled and howled the

	smell of blood set them wild they
surged forward over the narrow
bridge

  terry lifted the gun and emptied it
they scarcely recoiled from the flash-
ing fire tremblingly he broke the gun
clipped out the empties put loads in
marie clung to him

  again the pack turned loose and the
echoes of their howls filled the canyon
terry prayed that the crew might hear
them and hasten to his rescue he
prayed that no  might flash round
the curve

  he looked down at the struggling
body of the pony when the  train
came down the hill the engineer would
never see the pinto on the trestle until
it was too late to stop might not the
animal derail the engine send it into
the- chasm

  eyes gleamed terry lifted the re-
revolver to fire again he selected a
pair of eyes tried to hold the gun upon
them as his finger closed on the trig-
ger marie uttered a terrified scream

   look  she cried  look

  terry took his eyes off the pack in
front and turned to follow the direc-
tion of a pointing finger behind them


railroad stories

not fifty feet away other eyes were
gleaming they were trapped on the
bridge to front and rear there was no
escape

  and then like the flash of light in
darkness terry knew what had hap-
pened to ranse gaston alone in the
canyon he had been trapped upon the
bridge just as he and ranses daughter
were tonight with wolves on both
sides he had found his knife had
sought to take toll from the rushing
pack the blade had broken ranse
had not remained to be devoured he
had leaped

  terry glanced down into the chasm
there snow lay deep and more was
falling

  clutching the girl in his arms he
cowered backward the trap was clos-
ing in the wall of eyes was drawing
nearer just behind the dead body of
the pony shadowy forms surged in and
back then the forms were wiped out
and only eyes remained

  the dense black darkness closed
upon them in the act of moving of
reaching for the lanterns on the tie his
foot had slipped his hand had
bungled the lanterns had turned over
had slipped and plunged downward in-
to the depths of the canyon

  terry lifted old bill grahams re-
volver to fire again and again a yelp
followed the last shot

  empty gun in hand he turned to the
women her panic was gone now with
death staring them in the face she had
grown calm

   marie he whispered

   terry an arm tightened about his
waist  why-why didnt you come
back to me 

  he folded her more closely his lips
found hers her arms kept tightening
about his waist they held the mack-
inaw more closely as the mackinaw

tightened terry felt a something hard
and sharp in the small of his back he
flinched

  with a cry he freed his right arm
he flashed it to his hip it came back
with a long cylinder pointed at the tip

  his red fusees until now he had
forgotten them

  trembling so much he could scarcely
hold one he fumbled with the cap al-
ready the beasts were devouring the un-
fortunate pony already the ones to
the west were creeping nearer

  he scratched the sanded surface of
the cap to the phosphorus light burst
upon the scene a brilliant red sputter-
ing flare which made the whole bridge
as light as day

  in the light the gaunt forms tumbled
over each other scampering for cover

  terry followed them from the
bridge far up the canyon the whistle
of no  was sounding carrying
marie in his arms he ran to meet it
he waved the fusee the whistle an-
swered his signal as fire shot from
wheels the pullmans stopped and
terry carried her into the rear one

a mont h later they were mar-
ried gyp stood up as best man
old bill graham gave the bride away
it was a pretty wedding even gyp
said so

  pierre le grange was not there he
heard about it he fingered the broken
blade of a pocket knife it was rust-
eaten and almost destroyed for many
years it had been in the body of a
timber wolf pierres youngest son
skinning the beast at the bridge had
found it the old man held the blade
between his thumb and forefinger
wagged a knowing head and to a new
brakeman who had listened to his re-
cital of the legend of the canyon he

j i  jp tion of northerners that

	f started on a now-famous

          southern tour we were un-
der the direct supervision of brigadier-
general thomas who at that time had
not yet fallen heir to the title of  rock
of chickamauga exhausted by hard
fighting and long marches we were in-
trenched on a spur of hills around
chattanooga it was far from being a
pleasant situation and unless we re-
ceived reinforcements in short order it
was only a matter of time before we

would be garnered into the fold by the
confederate general bragg or die of
starvation

  forty miles eastward general stock-
ton with a command of about 
men guarded a pass in the mountains
had he been aware of the danger to us
there would have been nothing to it
but bragg was a real soldier and he
took pains to see that no information
of our plight leaked through his lines
the  miles separating the two union
forces were heavily guarded day and
night it seemed impossible for a mes-
senger to elude the wary foe and our


railroad stories

force was inadequate to fight its way
through

  confident in their strength the con-
federates had not destroyed the rail-
road line between the two federal
camps figuring they had us at their
mercy and that the line would be
needed by themselves in the future

  with the exception of a few of the
older ones bragg was in possession of
the better classes of locomotives be-
longing to the road but after discuss-
ing the situation with members of his
staff general thomas decided to make
a bold attempt to break through
braggs lines by way of therail line

  volunteers were called for need-
less to say a great number of us
jumped at the chance by good luck
one of the volunteers was a man who
had formerly been employed on the
road as an engineer he was familiar
with every mile of the pike and on
numerous occasions had demonstrated
his resourcefulness and bravery natu-
rally he was the first to be selected im
sorry i cant recall his full name but
i remember he was called jack a cap-
tain was picked to carry the dispatches
and i was picked to do the firing the
best engine in camp was made ready
for the trip but it was nothing more
than an old scrap heap

  a dark cloudy night was selected
for the getaway with a storm threat-
ening the soldiers and artillerymen
guarding the line would be seeking
shelter

   get all the oil and grease you can
find jack instructed  ive run this
old mill before and she uses more oil
than any on the road

  when we started off about  
pm every tallow-pot was filled to the
brim and the rod cups simply oozed
valve oil wasnt as plentiful in those
days as it is today and a favorite sub-

stitute was ordinary tallow melted
down

  with the eyes of the entire corps on
us we started out the old steam kettle
wheezing and snorting as jack wid-
ened on the thumblatch throttle and
began working the johnson bar up the
quadrant the old scrap heap picked up
speed

we received our first message two
miles from the starting point it
came in the form of a rifle ball that
plowed its way through the cab but
fortunately struck none of us it
sounded the key-note in the prelude
that was soon to follow

   no chance to slip through this
crowd jack shouted weve got to
make a run for it and trust to luck try
to melt the firebox boy ill want
steam im going to take everything
shes got

  the captain climbed down from his
perch on the left hand side to assist me
in tossing wood into the firebox the
gage needle started to climb but fast
as we traveled the bullets traveled
faster and those southern boys were
shooting close how we slipped
through that hail of death is more than
i can say flashes of light split the
darkness on all sides then out of the
night came a tremendous boom a bat-
tery had joined the infantrymen a
solid shot was followed by a burst of
grapeshot that cut the top of the cab
to splinters but luckily struck no vital
part of the engine and missed the three
of us one ball knocked the bell sup-
port from its moorings and sent the
bell still ringing into the bushes along
the right-of-way

  clear of the battery we had a brief
respite but it was not for long ap-
proaching a junction several miles up
the line we were forced to run the fire
true tales of the rails



of two more small batteries while the
reception from these was lighter than
that of the first and their shots were
no so well aimed a new danger sud-
denly presented itself on a siding
all fired up and ready to go stood an
engine which jack recognized as one
of the best and speediest on the divi-
sion capable of running rings around
us

  he had hardly ceased speaking when
one of the last shells fired by the bat-
tery burst almost directly overhead
while it failed to slow us up a splin-
ter sent me bleeding to the deck it
looked as if i was out of commission
the captain showed he was equal to the
task expected of him by continuing to
bale in the wood several other shells
broke harmlessly in the air and by the
faintness of their explosions we rea-
lized we had passed the range of the
last battery as the sound of the last
boom faded in the distance a rifle ball
splattered against the boiler head

   were beyond the batteries the
dispatch bearer shouted  that mus-
ket ball was fired by one of the pickets
this side of their line

  by this time i was sitting up and
taking stock of myself i was feeling
anything but comfortable but much as
i pained i retained a vivid idea of our
situation suddenly my ear detected a
strange sound

   theyre after us i screamed

  the captain turned toward jack a
pitying smile on his face

   the kid is delirious he remarked

  jack straightened and glanced back
down the track for a moment he was
silent then yelled  delirious hell
theyre on our trail

  he hardly ceased speaking before a
brilliant flash of flame illuminated the
treetops

   thats the reflection from their

firebox he shouted  pile in the
wood

  allowing his engine to run wild he
dropped to the deck he picked me
from the floor and trussed me into the
seat he had vacated or rather what was
left of the seat

   hang onto that throttle bud and
keep her open im needed on deck
he shouted

  while the dispatch bearer continued
to bale in the wood jack climbed to
the back of the tender where he
dropped a slash bar to the rails sev-
eral extra grates followed suit

as we dashed on into the night we
-strained our ears for the crash of
a derailed engine anxiously we
glanced back in the direction of our
pursuer now shortening the distance
between us but no crash came her
low slung pilot probably swept the ob-
stacles from its course

   five miles more and theyll have
us if something dont happen jack
shouted as a bullet from the pursuing
engine zipped across the tender and
flattened itself against the boilerhead
 and there aint another thing loose
we can drop on the tracks

  it was true the engine had been
stripped when we started on the trip
then as if impelled by a sudden idea
jack began to take off his coat and
trousers

   get out of your clothes he yelled
to the captain  heave them over the
hind end maybe theyll catch in his
eccentrics and slow him up

  two suits of clothing went sailing
into the night again we waited with
anxious faces then the trained ear of
the engineer detected a choking sound
and hiss of escaping steam

   shes caught shes caught he
yelled in exultation


railroad stories

  but his joy was of brief duration
from my position above the deck i had
a better view of the pursuer than niy
comrades

   her eccentrics arent jammed
shes still after us i shrieked

  again the thunder of the pursuing
locomotive could be plainly heard and
it was apparent she was rapidly gain-
ing on us

  the distance between us was grad-
ually lessening and sharp flashes of
light indicated the confederates were
trying to end the chase with rifle balls

  eight miles more and we would be
so near to stocktons lines that our pur-
suers would be obliged to turn back or
submit to death or capture

   and were almost there groaned
the dispatch bearer  isnt there any-
thing we can do 

   nothing except to trust in provi-
dence jack replied as he glanced
hopelessly in my direction

  then he leaped to my side some-
thing that i was trying hard to say
attracted him

   what is it bud  he asked

   the tallow why dont you try
that  i gasped

  with a whoop of exultation jack
dropped back to the deck

  we aint licked yet he bellowed
at the astonished captain  come on
he yelled as he grabbed an oil can and
one of the pots of hot tallow from the
shelf above the firebox door and then
dived toward the rear end of the
tender

  not knowing what it was all about
but realizing the engineer had some
plan in mind the dispatch bearer seized
the second tallowpot and followed

   lean over and try to grease the
rail jack instructed at the same time
signaling me to cut down the speed
sufficiently to steady the swaying

engine gripping the end of the tank
to prevent their being pitched to the
tracks the two leaned as far down as
they could slowly the liquid tallow
oozed from the curved spouts of the
cans and when it fell on the rails it
hardened from the coldness of the
iron in a short while all the cans were
emptied

  sparks were flying from the pur-
suers stack the men who manned
her realized they were getting danger-
ously near the union lines and were
putting on every ounce of power and
speed to overtake us success was in
sight for them and in another minute
or so they would attain their objective

  then something happened for a
moment their engine seemed to glide
and there was no immediate slacking of
speed

  but in time the drivers started to
spin like wild and their speed befan
to lessen

  gazing to the rear we could almost
imagine hearing the engineer shout and
then twist frantically at his throttle
our battered union engine wreck con-
tinued on and our anxiety gave way to
hope many sounds had beguiled our
ears since we started our trip but that
of the churning engine behind was the
sweetest

  then suddenly we were brought
to attention by a shot in front

   the union outpost the dispatch
bearer yelled triumphantly  shut her
off bud

  jack executed the order i had
passed out i was a limp piece of hu-
manity when willing men in blue lifted
me from the wreck of the cab and hur-
ried me to a hospital the first thing
i heard when i regained consciousness
a few hours later was a bugle call sig-
naling the departure of the division to
the relief of general thomas

captain ansleys reward

by h c peace

hen i came to florida
in  the territory be-
tween gainesville and
ocala where i located
was served by the old
narrow-gage florida southern r r
operating between palatka and brooks-
ville soon after my arrival i hired
out for it as baggage-master and flag-
man

  i shall never forget the many disad-
vantages in the operation of this nar-
row gage line chief among them was
the daily transfer at palatka and high
springs of freight cars from standard
to narrow-gage trucks in those days
the janney type of automatic coupler
was just coming into use while our
car were equipped with the old link
and pin drawheads this added to the
danger and annoyance

  i had been with the florida south-
ern but a short time when a deal was
completed whereby the plant system
now part of atlantic coast line ac-
quired ownership of all the narrow
gage trackage in central florida which
included not only our road but also
two connecting short lines the st
johns  lake eustis and the south
florida r r the latter locally dubbed
 the orange belt

  almost immediately henry b plant
head of the system bearing his name
determined that these tracks must be
standardized hence the call for bids
on the change the terms specifying
lowest possible cost quickest possible
change and most important no delay
to u s mails

  thus a crowd of engineers repre-
senting various construction concerns

assembled in the office of the general
roadmaster in savannah ga for the
opening of the bids when they were
all given the lowest figure was around


  such a small cost for such an im-
portant piece of engineering would
hardly seem exorbitant and neither
did it appear so to shrewd henry b
plant in fact there is little doubt but
that plant would have quickly ac-
cepted that particular bid had not
captain ansley general roadmaster
of the railroad been present

   i can do it for much less and over-
night at that he asserted

  the significant stillness following
this bold statement was broken by
plant 

   surely mr ansley you are not
sincere in that statement

   never more so in my life replied
the roadmaster

   these gentlemen are all technically
trained engineers mr ansley and ap-
parently they think you are joking to
be perfectly frank you would simply
have to show me concluded plant

   and that is just what i am asking
you to let me do quickly retorted
ansley

   i dont think its possible reiter-
ated plant however he was not that
silly type of successful business man
who would have his way regardless of
cost so he courteously consented to
meet the roadmaster the same evening
and listen to his plan

  never had ansley been more in
earnest clearly and concisely that
evening he outlined every detail of his
scheme quickly meeting every objec-


railroad stories

tion convincingly answering every
question at the close of the interview
he was rewarded by the assurance from
his chief that his plan undoubtedly
possessed merit and that he would take
the matter under careful consideration

  knowing plants frugality captain
ansley retired that night confident that
he had won the big chance to demon-
strate his engineering ability not for
nothing had he worked up from the
lowly position of section hand to gen-
eral roadmaster slaving all day and
studying half the nights to fit himself
for just this sort of emergency on
this particular contract he was certain
he could and would save the company
not less than  and at the same
time boost himself

as he had fully expected the next

	day h b plant rejected all bids
summoned the roadmaster to his office
and instructed him to proceed accord-
ing to the plan outlined

  from ansleys office that same day
an order went out to all division road-
masters over the whole plant system
calling them to savannah for a con-
ference two days later at this meet-
ing he outlined his plan of action and
received their hearty promise of co-
operation

  to division roadmaster j s jolly
under whose jurisdiction the narrow
gage trackage lay was allotted the work
of strengthening the base he was in-
structed to have every section gang on
his division spend practically all of the
next thirty days pulling old short ties
and replacing them with standards

  the other division roadmasters were
urged to rush their own regular track
repairs so as to be prepared to lend as
many of their crews as needed for the
track widening on jollys division

  meantime with mathematical pre-

cision ansley figured out and an-
nounced the day for the conversion to
each roadmaster he issued advance
orders to have the required number of
his foremen and their crews at certain
designated points along the narrow
gage lines on the morning of that date
all passenger trains were to get special
orders while all freight traffic would
be temporarily suspended

  the plan was that when regular
passenger train no  had passed no
 about the middle of the afternoon
of that day the two section gangs
nearest their point of passage would
fall in behind them one working north
the other south until they contacted
the starting point of the crews next
ahead and so on all along the line

  it worked perfectly some men
wielded bars and slipped rails some
set gages others swung sledges and
spiked down again until the last ile
of narrow gage railroad in central
florida was a thing of the past

  the following morning found the
work complete with people at every
station to greet the monster coal
burners nos  and  pulling the
regular passenger trains over the new
savannah-port tampa route i recall
that freight engine no  an old
narrow gage had been overhauled and
converted to standard trucks it was
so stiff it could hardly round a curve
and consequently was the cause of a
mean wreck later on

  it was ten years later that i heard
the sequel to the track-widening drama
the old plant system had been ab-
sorbed by the fast-expanding a c l
i had long since abandoned railroading
to its fate due to the usual misunder-
standing between the management and
employee about pay and was residing
in a famous resort town in north
florida when captain ansley came

there for his health he was now old
gray stooped and broken in body and
spirit

  we were sitting on my porch one
evening when our conversation drifted
to railroad reminiscences had i known
of his feelings i would have evaded
the subject but i remembered the fine
thing he had once done and i men-
tioned it the first chance i had

  with tears in his eyes he thanked
me for my compliment then

brokenly he uncovered certain bits of
his lifes story

   in my office the morning after the
gage was widened he said  when the
dispatchers had assured us that regular
traffic was resumed i was showered
with congratulations i was especially
elated when mr plant graciously
patted me on the shoulder and compli-
mented my achievement

   what did they finally do for you
captain i asked


railroad stories

   do for me hell  he blurted  do
to me you mean not a thing more
did i ever hear from it but get this
straight i am not blaming anyone in
particular had not fate removed my
best friend h b plant i still believe
he would have taken care of me
neither can i blame the a c l man-
agement who knew so little of me and
of course had their own men to place
and perhaps the matter of economy to
consider

   although it was inevitable that

certain drastic changes must result
from the reorganization i felt almost
certain of being kept on but i soon
found that i had no more standing with
the new management than a mexican
dog at a furriers convention in fact
and briefly i was fired and so ended
my railroad career

  after that i never saw captain an-
sley again nevertheless i cant help
wondering if they had suspected his
real value back there in the nineties
would they have let him get away

the ould blackball system

              by fred richmond

xty-eight years ago a
green kid of sixteen i be-
gan railroading on the m-
k-t in kansas and later
drifted down to texas and
got a job braking on the missouri pa-
cific iron mountain in the course
of time after going from one job to
another i was hired as freight conduc-
tor by j k painter the iron mountain
division superintendent at san anto-
nio then painter fired me after i had
made thirteen round trips

   sorry we wont need you any
more he said curtly  you just cant
make the time

  i knew i was making as good time
as any other freight conductor on the
division and better than most of them
but the super would not listen to me
and so i got the royal can

  now in those days every division
superintendent on the jay gould sys-
tem of railroads was obliged to keep a
list of all employees a record of those
discharged and the reason for such dis-
charge these lists were sent to head-

quarters printed in pamphlet form and
distributed to officials of every pike in
the country as a result whenever a
man applied for work on any road the
super would tell him

   come back again tomorrow and ill
see what i can do for you

  then as soon as the man had gone
mr brass hat would refer to his gould
literature if this contained the appli-
cants name it was just too bad the
official would reply when he came back
next day

   i am very sorry theres nothing
doing business is poor just now and
we are pulling off crews

  well that trick was sprung on me
superintendent painter put me on the
infernal blacklist and after that i met
with rebuffs every time i tried to con-
nect with another railroad under my
own name

  naturally i wasnt exactly tickled to
death by all this i went to a lawyer
and told him the whole story i said i
wanted to prosecute the gould system
but had no money
true tales of the rails



    would you be willing to handle the
case for a fifty-fifty contingent fee  i
asked that is if we should win the
lawyer could keep half of whatever
money was collected as damages if we
didnt win he would get nothing

   its a risky thing bucking the
gould system the attorney re-
sponded  but ill take the case pro-
vided you can get hold of a blackball
book with your name in it

  so i got in touch with a friend a
conductor on the santa fe at ottawa
kansas my present home town he
wrote back he would try to locate one
of the books for me

  a few days later the book arrived
it had  pages each page contained
the name of  former employees of
the gould system who were black-
balled for various reasons some of
the best known boomers in america
were included in that list of 
games

  with this evidence my lawyer
brought suit at waco texas in fact
two suits i proved at the trial by
forcing the railroad to produce the
train sheets that i had made more
round trips  on time  than any other
freight conductor on the division dur-
ing the period of my employment under
superintendent painter

   i lost both suits but the resultant
publicity caused the gould outfit to re-
call their old blackball books and no
new ones were issued thereafter an
honest railroad man could apply for a
new job without fear of being hounded

but that wasnt the only blackball
in railroad history another one
dated from the great pullman strike
of -which was conducted by the
american railway union under the

see the pullman strike mystery by james
deegan in aug  railroad stories

leadership of gene debs this walk-
out failed and the union was broken
then the strikers began seeking jobs
on other roads but their former em-
ployers refused to give them service
letters and established a blacklist

  this continued until some man
brought suit against one of the rail-
roads and was awarded damages
thereupon the roads saw the light
any man calling for a service letter
would get it these letters would set
forth his record with the company and
end with  left the service of his own
accord

  but there was a catch w f

jones went into the office of a train-
master looking for a job smith
asked the trainmasters clerk

     hiring any brakemen

lets see your service letter

   smith gave him the letter the
clerk took it into the next room re-
turned in a few seconds and handed it
back saying sorry cant use you

   the same process was repeated
with jones except that the clerk said
to jones come back this afternoon
and fill out an application

   both these young brakemen were
about the same age and had about the
same length of railroad experience
both service letters read very much the
same so the applicants naturally won-
dered why jones had been hired and
smith rejected finally in closely com-
paring the two letters the men hap-
pened to hold them up in front of a
strong light and noticed the  water-
mark  in the paper both watermarks
depicted a crane but jones crane stood
with head erect while smiths bird had
its head hanging down as though with


railroad stories

a broken neck this indicated that
smith had taken part in the pullman
strike

  and that is how the railroads pun-
ished  dynamiters even today de-
spite the ruling of joseph eastman
federal coordinator that railroads

must permit their employees to join any
labor organization without being dis-
criminated against the so-called com-
pany unions still fatten on the official
sanction of brass hats but there is no
more gould blackball system i am
glad i helped to break that up

an unlucky locomotive

              by james w earp

                  conductor on the rock island

e were waiting for the
carmen to test the air on
the extra  when a
switch engine rolled by
on the track next to our
train b- l wheatley supervisor of
fuels and lubrication for the rock
island turned to me

   see that switch engines number
i nodded it was the  he smiled
 i never see that engine that i dont
think of another engine of like number
that came to horton some forty-four
years ago her career was one of the
strangest i ever knew if you will add
the numerals -- together you will
see they total  for the superstitious
that might account for the bad luck
that hounded the  personally i am
not superstitious but the fact remains
that the  lived up to its reputation of
an unlucky locomotive to the end

  he told me the story

it was back in  that the 
came to horton kansas the
brooks locomotive works had built
her for the c k and n otherwise the
chicago kansas and nebraska rail-
road she was first assigned to passen-
ger work out of chicago an engine
wiper noticed her number

   this is an unlucky engine he told
a brother wiper  anytime the num-
bers on an engine make thirteen you
got a bad luck hog if i was an engi-
neer i wouldnt want to run her

  as if to prove the engine wipers
statement the  hit a street car a few
days later and killed eighteen persons
outright the story of the  was
taken up by the newspapers and the
publicity given it made the officials
send the engine to the colorado
division

  if they hoped to change the engines
luck by the move they were mistaken
the  went through a bridge one
night and into the river killing engi-
neer bob mccormick and injuring
fireman dick hanley so that he never
worked again

  they brought her back to the horton
shops to be repaired she needed it a
more dilapidated engine i never saw
but the mechanics fixed her up as good
as new when all she needed was a
coat of paint the painter assigned to the
job fell off her and broke his neck he
was dead when they found him this
incident did not add to her popularity
as you can imagine engineers and
firemen who were superstitious avoided
her as they would the devil
true tales of the rails



  i was firing out of horton then was
an engineer when the rock island
bought the road our main line ran
through st joseph missouri for
some time a feud had been raging be-
tween the union pacific and the c k
 n due to the fact that the c k 
n had made an agreement with the
u p to use its tracks between beatrice
and lincoln evidently the u p had
changed its mind after signing the
agreement and try as it might the
c k  n could not get the u p to
live up to its contract a court ruling
it seems declared that since the c k
 n had never used the tracks as per
the agreement it was being deprived
of nothing by not being permitted to
use said tracks but on the other hand
if it once used the tracks the contract
would be binding on both parties

  determined to break in and get the
use of the tracks the officials of the
q k  n decided on a bold stroke
eight crews were sent from horton to
beatrice with orders to get in on the
u p tracks by hook or by crook and
to stay there until they did break in if
it took a year the  was one of the
engines to go george smith was the
engineers name i was fireman on the
 with engineer carnahan

  so up to beatrice we went all tickled
at the chance of having a little fun and
maybe a few fights on our arrival at
the connection we found a bunch of
union pacific engines lined up in such
a way as to foul their line and prevent
us from getting out on their tracks

after a day or two of useless wait-
ing we took counsel among our-
selves some wanted to give battle and
run the u p men off others wanted
to do something else finally one of
the conductors unfolded a plan that
sounded the most feasible he knew a

u p engineer he would try to get
him off his engine if he did one or
more of our men were to take posses-
sion of the engine and use it to push
the other engines out of the way

  the conductor got the engineer off
his engine how he did it i never
knew as soon as he had accomplished
his purpose he yelled to us

   go to it you devils get to it
we went to it two of our men
climbed into the cab of the engine and
got busy the engineer threw the
johnson bar in the forward motion and
gave her steam that was as far as he
got the other engineers for the u p
were on the job with their reverse
levers and the captured locomotive
never moved off its spot

  well we retired beaten but not ad-
mitting it what we might have tried
next is hard to say without warning
we were called off the u p had sur-
rendered the c k  n was to have
the right to use their tracks and we
were to return to horton the feud
was over

  that night saw four extras going
back to horton carnahan and myself
were on the last extra the  engi-
neer smith was just ahead of us on the
 the two extras ahead of us were
leaving town about the time we backed
on to our cabooses smith was oiling
around the  when carnahan and
myself strolled over

   you ride with death when you ride
on that engine carnahan told smith

  smith laughed he was not at all
superstitious a few moments later
the conductors showed up with the
orders both of us had meet orders
with no  at bern the  with
smith at the throttle left town like a
whirlwind and we followed

  just out of dubois we were flagged
by george morley the rear brakeman


railroad stories

on extra  he was badly hurt and
at the point of death but he had man-
aged to get back far enough to signal
us and keep us from piling into the
wreck ahead of us where the  and
no  had met in a head-on collision
the old oil headlights we had in those
days were not the far-lighting electrics
that were to come later

  we noseddown to the scene of dis-
aster both engineers had been killed
in the accident i think the firemen
were too the conductors and other
brakemen were dead or nearly so i
grew sick as i thought how close we
came to being in the same fix would
have if it had not been for morley

  of course there was an investiga-
tion the findings told the whole story
the first two extras had made bern on

no s timetable schedule no s
engineer and crew coming along and
seeing the two extras in there took it
for granted they-were the two extras
mentioned in the order

  that was the end of the  no
they did not scrap her engines are not
so quickly discarded as that once
more she was taken back to the horton
shops and overhauled but when she
came out she was numbered 

  perhaps those in charge figured a
change in numbers might mean a
change in luck the fact remains that
the newly numbered engine was sent to
herington kansas and worked out of
there for years without a single re-
corded mishap the funny part of it
all is that no one noticed that the num-
bers -- also totalled thirteen

the boomers corner

          wonder what the old-time boomers
jjjij are doing now that the railroads are
 - not firing men i certainly get a big
 kick when i see some of their names
in print where are jack wilkenson

 my wild irish rose  on the flute and how
carrington could play the popular tunes on his

them but that they are still doing it on the le-

  trainmaster a g dowson on the p r r at
cleveland once told me it cost the railroad 
to educate a brakeman ail i can say is  if
they paid that much in training me without get-
ting back  they were short changed

  i have lots of regard for the student brakeman
for i dont think anyone ever pulled any bigger
boners than i did on my student trips i pulled
all the common ones such as reading the orders
and then throwing them out of the engine cab

out signal oil in the hay burner and asked the

this actually happened

 oh its great to be the yardmaster

 while the snakes are sorting box cars
 out in the snow and storm

 from the bosses up the line

  why in the name of heaven

 cant you get them out on time

 and the yard is corked up tight

 the dispatcher is insane

 he wants to know how soon well take
 those reefers off the main

 hell must be just like heaven

 he jumps up from his chair

 tearing madly at his hair

 and his eyes are gleaming
 with an icy glassy stare

 the snakes all say y ms dumb

 just another false alarm

 and why the devil didnt

 that guy stay on the farm

have dreamt of such a
moment as this   

his last quarter

by herb heasley

chief line clerk el paso terminal texas  new orleans rr

      wenty-five cents in
i -j cash and a dollars worth of
 pie-book old pete-cawley
j grinned and returned his
total assets to his pocket a
ceaseless winter drizzle beat a soft tat-
too ttpon the window the tiny gas
heater had gone out old pete shivered
and spat contemptuously on the floor
regal hotel railroad mens head-
quarters a prize dump among the
many flop houses hed seen in his day

  tomorrow they had just told
pete youll pay up or-

  he had always been a boomer even
when the day of the boomer had
passed old pete couldnt seem to stay

with one railroad for long in blister-
ing weather and blustering his life had
been spent mostly on wheels a link-
and-pin veteran he knew the game
from a to izzard but he had waited
too long to tie down and start pushing
his name up the rounds of a seniority
roster

  a man simply had to have lots of
whiskers to hold a railroading job
these days so pete hadnt batted an
eye when he got his expected cut-off
letter that afternoon-even though it
meant to a man of his years that he
was through with the rails forever

  no use for a fellow to kid himself
pete cawley was through he was


his last quarter



tired mighty tired and a little bit re-
lieved a fellow can worry so much
over a pending disaster that he almost
welcomes its coming

   it was tough to leave the game after
all these years with only twenty-five
cents cash and a dollar in pie-ljook
railroading owed pete more than that
a whole lot more couldnt kick
though hed lived hed seen the
sights and hed had his fun and his
grief on almost every high-iron be-
tween boston and frisco

  and friends those gems that
brighten the dimming memories of an
old railroader    red regan
originally of the grand trunk hefty
starling and stumpy webb of the
vermont central mike conley of the
seaboard boomer richards jack
neal but mainly red regan

   old pete laced his fingers and gazed
out at the rain unseeingly through the
soty window    like brothers theyd
been pete cawley and red regan
back in those days when the sixteen-
hour law was being fought over and
rule g was a distant ideal back when
block signals and remote control hadnt
been heard of and a man could call
an official by his first name

  fifty-fifty on everything he and
red regan back there when the call
of the horizon had kept them itch-
footing from yard job to road job
across the map and back boisterous
free-spending h a r d-fighting red
regan a way about him with the
women and more railroading in him
than half of the operating officials

  then one day like brothers theyd
split pete cawley and red regan
faces strained and pale knuckles
white snarling hot bitter words that
only railroad men of that day could
handily lay tongue to-and over a
woman of course

   thered been other women but not
 like kitty mcghee kitty with a
 cloud of smoky hair and strange
 tempting gray-green eyes and an in-
 definable something that stirred mens
 blood whenever she leaned close to
 them across the counter in the yard
 beanery where she officiated

   no two men could share kitty mc-
 ghee she was first and last a one-
 man woman the fellow who won
 kittys heart would have her for life

   many had quarrelled and fought
over her pete cawley and red regan
did to pete she meant an end of
booming meant settling down to one
woman and one job but red regan
wanted her too and red had a way
about him he very seldom got
married but he did marry kitty
mcghee and pete cawley-

old pete sighed wearily and sat
down upon the squeaky bed
that dead gas heater made the room
seem even colder to look at it he
would have to put a quarter in the
meter his last quarter that would
leave him a dollar in pie-book one
buck why old pete had slipped more
than that to many a bum

   hed never done any bumming him-
 self old pete hadnt hed made his
 money hard and spent it easy hed
 been hungry and broke but hed never
 mooched a dime pete had taken his
 fun where he found it and whenever
 he went broke-well there was always
 another pay day around the corner in
 those days life had held a brimming
 cup to a youngsters lips now he was
 an oldster gazing at the dregs

   yes he had memories    red
 regan and the others most of them
 had long ago quietly drifted down the
 last lead track into the big yard   
 one more quarter to put into the


railroad stories

hungry gas meter then tomorrow
not even the comfort of that small
stove

  how much gas can you buy for a
quarter funny hed never thought
about that before a fellow gets pecu-
liar thoughts in his head when his mind
wont face the future that quarter
ought to furnish enough gas   -
plenty    just stuff those cracks
around the door and the window with
that newspaper hed picked tip in the
yard office that afternoon wouldnt
take long    and not bad    kind of
like going under the ether at the hospi-
tal maybe   

  numbly haltingly old pete spread
the newspaper upon his knees and
stared unseeingly at it mighty tired
seemed like that cold worked into his
marrow better snap out of it though
might get a call for the big hook or
the pile driver if this rain kept up
railroad man

  railroad man no not now no
more calls for this railroad man but
he couldnt get those words out of his
mind railroad man

  no wonder there were the very
words in that newspaper headline hed
been staring at petes eyes moved
across the line of big black letters

  his breath caught slightly he arose
and hobbled across the room to hold
the paper close to the fading light
which came through the drenched win-
dow the news item was a press dis-
patch from a nearby city to news-
papermen it was known as a human
interest yarn old pete cawley read

 railroad man makes

fortune from kind deed

  wealth results from charitable act
  of twenty years ago
  two decades ago j w  red  re-
  gan well-known local railroad man and

  secretary of the local lodge of the

  orc extended a helping hand to a
  down-and-out fellow man today that
  forgotten act of human kindness bore
  abundant fruit mr regan was advised
  by the trans-national oil co that a
  test well sunk on property owned by
  him in texas had proved a gusher   

    commenting on his good fortune mr
  regan told a reporter how he acquired
  the bonanza

    i was firing an engine on the old
  west texas  rio grande railroad
  some twenty years ago he said  when
  i met a destitute and friendless tuber-
  cular vietim who was homesteading
  near abilos my home terminal the
  head brakeman and i did what we could
  for the poor fellow providing necessi-
  ties until his death some weeks later

    his gratitude was expressed in a
  simple will which bequeathed his clap-
  board shack and a hundred acres of
  mesquite brush and jackrabbits to my
  partner and me my pal and i appre-
  ciated his gesture but were inclined to
  look on it as fools gold i threw the
  deed into my trunk and forgot all
  about it until a year or so later-after i
  had married and settled down and the
  delinquent tax notices found my per-
  manent address i was for disposing of
  the property right then but kitty mrs
  regan with notions of a chicken ranch
  for old age retirement talked me into
  holding it

     some years ago i lost track of the
  brakeman my old buddy who is joint
  heir to the texas propertr havent
  any idea where he is now but we hope
  to find him and turn his share over to
  him if he is still alive

     maybe he wont be hard to find i
  guess he is on a caboose or in an engine
  cab somewhere in the states or canada
  and probably feeding a hungry bum
  with his last quarter names pete
  cawley-

there was more to the story but
old pete didnt read further he
stumbled to the bed and dropped
heavily upon it

   feedin a hungry bum with his
last quarter  petes voice rose to
a wild cackling laugh yes sir my
last quarter feeding a hungry bum of
a gas meter my last two bits for a
ticket to hell
his last quarter



  for a long time pete sat and mut-
tered and laughed pounding clenched
hands upon his knees as he swayed
back and forth then a warm gleam
came into his faded blue eyes his
weather-beaten face lighted with a
grin he arose and addressed the leak-
stained fly-specked ceiling

  well regal hotel youre a
mangey den o stew bums cock-
roaches bedbugs an rats dang yore
crummy sheets you didnt git me did
you no sir you didnt git me an
you wont you come close an missed

an buy you then ill scrub you an
paint you-an pipe every one o yore
filthy rooms for steam heat but right

now im a-goin to put that quarter in
the gas meter an keep me from
freezint death

  a heavy pounding at the door inter-
rupted old petes rambling soliloquy

   come in he called out

  the door was flung open by a black-
slickered dripping call boy from the
yard office the kid extended his call
book pete was still holding his two
bits above the slot uncertainly he
might need that coin for something
else

  work train the newcomer an-
nounced soon as possible with
obrien an welch mess o rip-rap
and ballast to dump in cherry creek
shes running full and wild and try-
ing to gnaw our noble railroad in
two

  pete cawley continued to stare
why me he quavered i was cut
off th board today

  you aint now old-timer the
caller said impatiently youre plain
lucky they slapped a smallpox quaran-
tine on miz deans roomin house this
pm and tied up darn near our whole
extry board with it flus got two
other guys-and the rest of em slipped
out when they seen me coming in this
weather i guess ive blame near
shagged my legs off and youre the
last bet youre elected sign

pete hesitated a blissful expres-
sion came over his countenance
 goin on forty years i have dreamt
of such a moment as this but never
thought id live to see it

   every rail has this dream in his
time-a pretty dream about a call-
animal cornin to roust me out on just
such a wild night as this-an ketchin
me with so much o th long green in
my possession that i could afford to
laugh at you throw the book in your


railroad stories

face kick you into th street an tell
you to take his cussed railroad jam it
into th blackest pit o hell an heave
th trainmaster in after it

  the call boy fidgeted uneasily his
pose denoting readiness for fast and
prompt flight old pete remained in
his trance for a long moment then
he snapped out of it

  no longern a month ago he de-
clared in a brisk conversational tone
 i says to that squirt roadmaster that
th first good wet spell which come
along would throw that there bend o
cherry creek over agin our right o
way mr smart guy though he says
no th bright engineers an their blue-

prints have got that all fixed for he
says    an now look    i hope
i see that bozo down there tonight   
gimme yore pencil

  as the kid gingerly proffered his
book and pencil his suspicions of
petes sanity were confirmed by a re-
mark the old duffer made as he scrib-
bled his name his eyes were wild too
and he was smiling humorlessly

   oil wells can wait he mumbled
washouts cant

  nuts plumb nuts the call boy
told himself then thanks he
said aloud as pete proffered a twenty-
five cent tip-the old boomers last
quarter

 monkey motion

sure ril save your railroad job i
could even put sitting bull on his feet 

by the engine picture kid

bird in the hand gathers
no moss and a home guard
does not see so much rail-
road scenery as his boomer
brothers which is why
i quit my job as call boy at citrus on
the c  n in southern california
and come out here to the nevada min-
ing country

  besides i won a swell motion-pic-
ture camera in an engine picture con-
test with which i can take shots of
locomotive power in motion and other
interesting railroad sequences but not
around citrus now that the orange
rush is over there aint nothing there
but a study in still life until they start
shipping fruit again

  never do i forget old friends i
am not in toadstool nev three days
before i send a souvenir postcard to
hardshell higgins the hogger who is
also father of my girl friend golden-
rod

   having a fine time wish you
were both here is what i write on the
card on the other side of the card is
a fine picture of the new state prison
looking very pretty indeed with all the
iron bars on the windows and every-
thing

 somehow i dont get no answer
from hardshell nor from golden-
rod either that is the way with some
people out of sight out of mind

  things are humming at toadstool
monkey motion



that is on the n u  w they are
but i work for the nevada midland
the railroad situation is very peculiar
down here though the town is only
a wide spot on the edge of the desert
two standard-gage railroads run
through it on account of both have to
use the same pass to get across the
mountains just east of town

  the twin pikes are naturally fight-
ing like cats and dogs for toadstools
freight business a carload is a car-
load these days and shipments of high-
grade ore from the gray goose gold
mine are heavy it does not take much
rock to make up an extra freight drag
or so to be hauled to the smelter at
blue bonnet on the eastern side of the
pass

  a funny little guy named abijah
rogers with bandy legs a deep chest
a round red face and a voice like a den
full of bears owns the gray goose and
nost of toadstool that dont belong
to the railroads for their repair shops
roundhouses paint sheds and so forth
this rogers fellow is doing all his
business with the n u  w it is
very tough for the nevada midland
there being no more mines in toad-
stool that is making any money except
the gray goose

a lot of people on the n m are
very depressed over the situation
especially ignatz montoya who is the
freight agent and ordinarily a very
good-looking mexican his real name
is ignacio

    ignatz i says as we are sitting in
the greasy spoon where i am having a
fried egg sandwich  you dont look
happy

  he shook his head

   happy  what is to be happy these
days says ignacio sadly my so-
beloved railroad say unless i am pro-

duce beezniss i am soon weethout job
weethout job i cannot marry senorita
maria estancia garcia y mendoza

   you cant marry all them dames
anyhow i says  you aint no mor-
mon

   ignatz dont pay any attention but
goes right on with his troubles

   every day i have see senor
rogers i beg i plead i go down on
thee so-proud knees of a montoya that
he weel give even wan carload of his
rock to the nevada midland for pull
to blue bon-net

  yeah i says maybe you aint
got the right approach what does the
old billy-goat say

   wan word how you call it 
nerts

   well i can see that this ignatz dont
know a thing about modern business
methods so i says to him  ignatz
you have come to the right place for
advice

   the agents face lights up  you
can help he inquires

   brother i says  i am a guy
which could even put sitting bull on
his feet let alone a railroad job like
the nevada midland is at toadstood

  how he asks paying for my
fried egg sandwich

   pretty soon i have unfolded a swell
scheme which with the aid of my mo-
tion-picture camera will get ignatz a
slice of rogers shipping for the ne-
vada midland and maybe all of it pic-
tures aint like a sales talk i explain
pictures dont lie

  weel the company stand for it
ignatz wants to know

    they will most likely give us a
medal or a raise or something i says

 superintendent philbrick is anxious
to get some loaded cars moving out of
here so he can make a freight showing
for this division point


railroad stories

  so montoya goes off to see can he
arrange for a private showing of mo-
tion pictures to old man rogers il-
lustrating just how things are done on
the nevada midland while i brace the
trainmaster

   forget them dumb ideas says the
t m  and listen here yuh little punk
the crew on number eight says you
was late callin em this mornin and
applewaite firin twenty-seven never
signed the book yesterday one more
slip and yuhre canned if yuh wanta
make movin pitchers go to holly-
wood

  well as that is not very encourag-
ing i decide to see supt philbrick
himself -

  oh yeah snaps the super im
running this division not you if i
want any pictures taken ill take em
myself

   gosh i says  i didnt know you
was an engine picture fien like i am
mr philbrick

  after the red has died out of the
superintendents face some he thumps
his desk and yells at me  whats
more if i ever catch you fooling
around with a camera in that glorified
morgue we got for a freight yard ill
break your skinny neck

  he presses a button for his secre-
tary

   take a memo puddingstone he
snaps i can tell by the orders he is
issuing to the railroad police that he
aint fooling about pictures being took
on the desert division of the nevada
midland

however i am not one to lose
heart except now and then but
the rest of the day i am a little wor-
ried i am waiting to see if ignatz gets
an appointment with old man rogers
to show him actual moving-pictures of

how railroading is done on the nevada
midland if rogers wont listen to
him we are in a fix as far as our
scheme is concerned and if he does
listen we are even worse off because
now it looks like i wont get much
chance to take nevada midland movies
around toadstool

  ignatz meets me smiling he has the
bad news  senor rogers is willing to
see thee pictures friday night at hees
house at seex-thirty maybe we weel
to catch some of his rocks for nevada
midland

   yeah i says kind of gloomy
 and maybe well have the pictures to
show him

  it is a tough break for us because a
couple of brass hats have not got
modern ideas

  two or three times i try to sneak a
hundred feet or so of film on the ne-
vada midland-or maybe a dissolve
shot with some fade-ins and fade-
outs-and what happens every time
i am run off company property like i
was a bum

   its no use i says to ignatz
 tell maria whats-her-name you cant
marry her because you aint going to
have a job because you cant get a slice
of rogers business because i cant get
no movies of the nevada midland

   but says ignatz  we must have
some of theese moving pict-ures i
have promised an a montoyas word
is as good as his bond the mexi-
cans eyes suddenly flashed dangerous-
ly  my frien he says  you said
you would get thee pictures it is noth-
ing nothing at all for a montoya to put
the heart out of a man who makes joke
with heem

  his right hand reaches suggestively
for his belt i can see he carries a long
knife there

   oh i says  thats different
monkey motion



   it is thee case says the freight
agent solemnly

  before friday i have an idea in
fact two of them the first is that if
i dont have some movies for ignatz
to show old man rogers i aint going
to live very long at least not around
toadstool the other idea is better

   if i cant take nevada midland
pictures i says to myself  why not

when the time comes ignatz and
me haul all the apparatus out to
old man rogers house we take
along the portable projection machine
the home silver screen rolled up like a
big map and the films

stop by cad ive seen
enough right now

take some scenes from the n u
 w 

  which is what i do the brass hats
over on the other road being live wires
and up on their toes every minute i
explain what i have done to ignatz
all he has to do after the pictures are
shown is tell rogers how much better
we do things on the nevada midland

   they are the true moving pict-
ures asks ignatz

   sure i says

   i am satisfy said ignatz

  but i aint so sure he is going to be
after abijah rogers sees how well
they are handling his business on the
n u  w

  this will be just like a pre-view mr
rogers i says  a real private show-
ing of railroad efficiency in action
only its the n u  w because i
couldnt get no shots of the nevada
midland

   never mind about that growls
mr rogers  did you bring a mickey
mouse along a show aint no good
without a mickey mouse

  it aint a very good start neverthe-
less we get rogers into his most com-
fortable chair and i turn the lights out
and begin showing my pictures the
first sequence shows a gang of men
loading rogers ore from the tipple into
cars a hundred feet aint been run


railroad stories

off before i realize that something is
wrong i guess old man rogers does
too for he jumps and shouts

   stop it by gad ive seen enough
right now

  the next thing i know he has found
the switch and turned on the lights and
is telling us to beat it the quicker the
better ignatz dont get no time for his
sales talk which he tries to put on as
rogers shoves us out the door

   to hell with your sales talk mr
rogers roars lifting a boot which is a
large size for a small man and aim-
ing it at ignatz where he thinks it will
do the most good  i can see cant i 
ignatz aint in no cheerful humor
neither when he picks himself up off
the sidewalk

  now he says you dope you
you have spill the frijoles

   well i says  ignatz you got
your own troubles and i got mine
in fact it turns out next morning i
have got even more troubles than 
counted on i am not down to the yards
five minutes before i am told that mr
philbrick wants to see me and that he
aint happy about something neither

  you young scalawag the super
yells at me across his desk  whats
the idea of showing pictures of the n
u  ws efficiency to rogers  i heard
about it last night is that your idea
of loyalty to the road you work for
he pauses then adds  let me correct
that statement the road you used to
work for

    i can explain everything mr phil-
brick i says meanfng to tell him just
why i had to take pictures of the rival
railroad

   you dont need to snaps the
super

  right then the door opens and in
comes old man rogers with a big grin
he walks like he has just got off a

horse he steps right up to mr phil-
brick and slaps him on the back

   hi phil he says  im giving
the nevada midland a chance at my
business today give you a months
trial and if im satisfied every car of
gray goose ore is yours

   mr philbrick is merely leaning back
in his chair and making movements
with his mouth like a fish out of water
mr rogers points to me

   theres the lad that did it hes
a funny-looking duck but hes smart
dont lose him hes the smartest kid
you got on the division

  just what i was saying when you
came in mr rogers i was telling
him about the raise were going to give
him next pay day says mr phil-
brick

   he deserves it says mr rogers
pulling a handful of cigars out of his
pocket and passing them to me and mi
philbrick  him and that mexican
freight agent montoya goes on mr
rogers  they come up to my house
last night and showed me some movies
of how things was done on the n u

	w that settled it pictures dont
lie phil what i saw determined me
to give you fellows a shot at my busi-
ness

   i am sure we can handle it satis-
factorily says mr philbrick still in
the dark

   i hope so mr rogers grins
again and waves a hand at me and
hurries out of the office

aeter he has gone mr philbrick
- asks me can i set up my projec-
tion apparatus and screen in- his office
as he would sure like to see the pic-
tures of the n u  w that sold
rogers on the nevada midland

   show em to me just like you done
to him says mr philbrick
monkey motion



  we get the office dark and the screen
set up and all and i begin with the
scene of the n u  w loading ore
cars at the gray goose mine it aint
long before mr philbrick starts laugh-
ing this is surprising to me because
i have never seen him smile before

  i	stop the machine just as the un-
loading scene is finished

   that sequence aint so good mr
philbrick i says  old man rogers
runs us out of the house and wouldnt
see the rest

  mr philbrick is still chuckling to
himself  are the rest just the same
he asks

   oh no i says  you see i was
taking a shot of the monkey motion
on the walschaert valve gear on one
of them big pacifics the c  n was
running back in citrus and when i
took them loading scenes i forgot the
camera was still set for slow motion
  are the other scenes in slow mo-
tion too asks mr philbrick

   no i says  the others are all
right heres one of a train of ore
cars pulling out of the siding

   never mind it says mr phil-
brick he yanks up the window shades
and presses a button on his desk in
comes his secretary

   take a memo miss pudding-
stone

   the memo is to the chief of the rail-
road bulls rescinding the former order
about my taking pictures on company
property of nevada midland motive
power and activities when he has fin-
ished dictating it mr philbrick looks
up at me he has a fine noble look on
his face

   son he says  i want you to do
some movies of our first trainload of
rogers ore he shakes his finger at
me  but by gad if you take em in
slow motion i wring your neck with
my own hands

   i wont i says  a mistake like
that could only happen once in a life-
time mr philbrick

  the super looks at me kind of funny
 at that i believe youre right he
says slowly then he turns to his sec-
retary again  take another memo
miss puddingstone  to the pay-
master

  it is about my raise and i notice
that ignatz gets one too so he can
marry all them dames i drop another
picture card to goldenrod higgins tell-
ing her the good news maybe this
time she will answer me and we can
have a double wedding maybe

what are the advantages of the steam loco-
motive over the diesel-powered locomotive
if any everything i read claims the diesel engine
to be more efficient and yet railroads keep on
ordering steam locomotives

   what keeps locomotive boilers from rusting
out-e k sabinal tex

   theoretical and actual operating efficiency
are two different things in the last analysis that
type of motive power is best which does the job
the most cheaply in this respect it is hard to
beat the good old steam engine for it still remains
the most flexible and simple piece of railroad
motive power ever devised it can meet a wide
range of operating conditions even when it is not
in first class shape it has few parts to get out
of order and is not dependent upon outside
source of power or a complex system of using its
own power it can be used on jobs which require
more than its rated capacity and yet can be
worked far below its capacity with fair results
it is uniformly efficient at both high and low
speed

  the diesel-powered locomotive on the other
hand is most efficient when running at a certain

 aku

wnatou
watttioknow

   fixed generally low speed and under such con-
   ditions is a great deal cheaper to operate than
   most steam locomotives thus it is well adapted
   for ships which run for days with little variation
   in speed and it is also being used with success
   in railroad yard work where efficiency at low
   speed is necessary perhaps diesel locomotives
   will be developed for high speed main lme work
   but whether or not they will be successful enough
   to supplant the steam engine is doubtful

      your question is somewhat puzzling iron
   or steel does not rust in the ordinary sense of
   the word unless it is exposed to air and the inside
   of a boiler when in use is never exposed to air
   after a long time however boilers do corrode
   and thus wear out few very old engines now
   in service have not been equipped with new
   boilers some time in their lives

  the chesapeake  ohio is frequently pointed
out as an example of what a well-managed
railroad should be what has been its financial
record in the last few years

    what is its equipment valuation etc-r
r minot n d

  	the chesapeake  ohio has come through
the depression with perhaps the best record of
any road in the country although its gross in-
come has dropped considerably it has not dropped
as much as that of most lines moreover it has
kept a comfortable spread between expenses and
income with the result that even its  net
income enabled it to pay a substantial dividend
following are a few figures showing its record
for the last four years

for the type of coal it carries has kept up it

that it is really the big factor in the cos finan-
cial condition while capable management has
played no small part in this record any railroad

a description of the new up streamlined
train mentions a new type air brake what
can you tell about it-l c c burlington vt

  since the streamlined train is designed to operate
at speeds of around  mph and since the up
signaling system etc would have to be rear-
ranged if it were to be stopped at ordinary rates
of deceleration a new type of brake was installed
it employs a  decelerometer which automati-
cally controls the brakeshoe pressure in propor-
tion to speed the instrument is a -lb
movable weight mounted on ball-bearing rollers
in line with the motion of the train attached
to it is a calibrated spring when the train is
moving at a high rate of speed the inertia of
the weight is naturally great and thus when
brakes are applied the spring is stretched farther
than it would be if the train were moving slowly
the distance which the weight moves when the
train is stopped determines the amount of brake
cylinder pressure and in order to eliminate a
jolt at the end of the stop the decelerometer is
fitted with a valve device which lowers the rate
of deceleration just before the train completely
stops thus it stops evenly and comfortably no
matter what the speed

   fifty lbs would suffice even less might

how does the wheel alignment of a locomotive
allow it to take sharp curves-l m

  although the gage of the track is widened at
the curve and there often are no flanges on the
center drivers all locomotives are definitely
limited to curves of a certain degree outside of
the factors already mentioned merely the lateral
motion of the drivers and the leading and trailing
trucks take care of the track curvature usually
a locomotive with more drivers can negotiate
a sharper curve than one of the same wheel base
with fewer drivers for example the erie --
types which have a driving wheel base of a little
more than  ft can take a  curve  ft
radius whereas the -- type class k-b with
only  ft driving wheel base is also limited to
a  curve

   in most cases it is sufficient to consider only
the rigid or driving wheel base when talking
about ability to negotiate curves leading and
trailing trucks can be designed to work with
almost any set of drivers even so an engine
such as you mention with a -ft wheel base
could not possibly negotiate a curve of -ft
radius were its driving wheel base only  ft
which is unlikely a locomotive taking curves

this sharp generally has a driving wheel base of
not more than  ft

how is the moffat tunnel on the denver

  fans are installed at the east portal of the
tunnel so arranged that the direction of the air
current through the tunnel may be reversed by
closing or opening certain doors when the
ventilating system is working a canvas curtain
is lowered over the east portal of the tunnel the
practice is to direct the current of air against
the approaching train so that the smoke will blow
back over it and maintain clear air in front of it

- lbs with booster

   by adjusting the johnson bar or re-
verse lever the engineer varies the travel of the
valves when the bar is  down in the corner
either in reverse or forward motion the valves
move at full stroke thereby opening the steam
ports for practically the entire stroke of the
piston and thus allowing more steam to enter

as he latches the bar up toward the center of
the quadrant the valve travel is decreased and
less steam is allowed to enter the cylinders when
this happens an engine is able to travel faster
for the cylinders are using less steam and there-
fore the boiler can supply it to them faster also
more use is made of the expansive power of
steam

wreck at prospect pa on the  b c  p december  
famous old-time railroad disasters

   next month-the firth of tay tragedy by frederick westing

the prospect wreck of 

on christmas eve  one of the saddest railroad disasters in pennsylvania his-
tory occurred at prospect pa just beyond mayville on the old buffalo corry 
pittsburgh railroad now in the pennsylvania system train no  was heading north
with a load of christmas mail and yuletide gifts and thirty-eight passengers all in
gay spirits most of them going home for the holiday season the train consisted of a
-- wood-burning locomotive the  n p bemis one mail-baggage car and one
passenger coach

    joseph haire veteran engineer and his fireman were on the smoky end con-
ductor fay flanders was in charge of the train other railroad men aboard were
claude hanson brakeman earl bacon mail clerk frank taylor baggagemaster con
maloney roadmaster william h lee superintendent of bridges and henry cowdry
machinist employed in the b c  p shops at corry pa bacon and taylor were toil-
ing laboiiously in the mail-baggage car while the engine crew were plugging away in
the cab and the rest of the railroad men were either working or  deadheading  in the
passenger coach

    at  pm december th no  train left corry and at  pm she left may-
ville north of mayville the first station was prospect about fifty yards from the
little frame depot at prospect the railroad crossed a deep gulch spanned by a wooden
trestle about twenty feet high and  feet long on a steep descending grade going
north

    as they neared the trestle engineer joe haire shut off steam the brakes were
partly set and the train was dragging hard she would probably stop before reaching
te prospect depot joe gave two long piercing blasts of the whistle as a signal to
release the brakes then he was about to increase the steam pressure when peering
backward out of the cab window he noticed to his horror that the rear truck of his
tender was off the rails while the mail-baggage car and the passenger coach were top-
pling off the bridge

    as the two cars broke loose and plunged downward into the snow-filled gully joe
stopped the engine on the far side of the bridge the tender wobbled and rocked but
finally came to a halt halfway suspended over the gulch the old coal stoves in the
cars immediately set them afire the coach burning at both ends at the same time
injured passengers pinned beneath the wreckage prayed aloud and shrieked with ter-
ror as the flames crept upon them when the cars fell the trucks crushed them in
closing the windows to render the situation even more desperate the coach was par-
tially tilted upon its side so there was absolutely no escape for the passengers on that
side

    those who succeeded in wrenching themselves free risked their lives with mag-
nificent courage in assisting the victims and recovering the bodies of the dead some
half dozen persons waiting at the station were soon at the scene of the accident but
worked at a disadvantage no water could be obtained the snow that was scraped
up had very slight effect in staying the flames only two axes were available and the
woodwork of the cars was bolted together so firmly that but little headway could be
made with them while these efforts were being put forth the red demon of fire was
steadily gaining now and then a rope was put through a crevice fastened to a form
and the sufferer was pulled out by main strength

    eighteen persons answered the last call in that wreck their bodies were solemnly
placed upon a sleigh drawn by a team of oxen and taken to the freight house at may-
ville for identification the cause of the accident according to the jamestown n y
journal was the breaking of a flange on the rear front wheel of the tenders hind truck
this was broken in going around the curve before reaching the trestle-harry heine-

the people of winnipeg wanted
a railroad but they had to
fight for it

besieging a railroad

              by jim holden

kne of the most awkward
battles of history was
fought  years ago be-
tween the citizens of
manitoba and the ca-
nadian pacific railway it marked the
end of a long war winnipeg business
men wanted a railroad to the united
states but the c p r did not want
them to have one

  winnipeggers pointed to general de-
pression the closing of their fanciest
cafes while the canadian pacific said
it owed the people of canada and else-
where all of  and could
not afford to lose any business this
was the state of affairs when premier
norquay of manitoba took charge

   the railroad will be built he said
to the cheering winnipeg citizens  at
the point of the bayonet if necessary
norquay gave a charter
to the local railroad which
winnipeg called the red
river valley line it was to
run west to portage la
prairie also south to the
united states boundary 
miles away although
neither norquay nor the

fighting citizens of winnipeg re-
alized it this was the beginning in
manitoba of the canadian national
system the portion of the line south
to the u s border is also part of the
c n r

  the canadian government at ot-
tawa vetoed the charter the winni-
peg people were enraged held mass
meetings and said unpleasant things
in their newspapers about the c p r
norquay issued a second charter it
was likewise vetoed winnipeg got
fighting mad and decided to build the
railroad anyway on july   the
premier dug the traditional spadeful of
earth

  under canadian laws it was neces-
sary to have ottawas permission to
cross any railroad norquay knew that
the red river would have to cross the
c p r but hoped that
permission would be forth-
coming to gain time
though winnipeg built its
line from both ends toward
the c p r tracks the
crossing would be near
headingly about nine miles
west of winnipeg
besieging a railroad



the three men who were responsible for the battle of fort wayne left to right 
joseph martin william whyte and the famous william van horne

  the president of the canadian pa-
cific at the time was william cornelius
an horne a fighting dutch-amer-
ican who had pushed the railroad
through to vancouver ottawa had
given him a virtual monopoly and he
intended to keep it

   the course taken by my company
he said in montreal  is absolutely nec-
essary for the preservation to canada
of her own traffic

winnipeg kept on building for
a year norquay fell but the
battle cry was taken up by his succes-
sors thomas greenway and joe mar-
tin they stormed ottawa finally
joe martin got himself appointed rail-
way commissioner for manitoba this
was considered a good sign but still
permission to cross the c p r did not
come winnipeg was annoyed sus-
pected van horne of playing politics
and said bitter things about him

  by october the red rivers track
was built up to the canadian pacific

on both sides a hundred yards was
left to go joe martin called winni-
peg men together on the night of the
nineteenth he had a plan

  the workmen entered into the spirit
of the thing and sweated all night to
complete the track martin and his
friends got a team and hauled a  dia-
mond  crossing to the spot

  moving swiftly and stealthily they
pried up the c p r rails and spiked
the diamond in place there was a
great sigh of relief from the winni-
peggers who were already counting
the wealth which the new railroad
would coin

  martin had the attorney general of
manitoba with him twenty special
constables were sworn in and stationed
to guard the precious crossing

  morning dawned on the new rail-
road and the hopeful faces of the
twenty winnipeg constables some of
their optimism went away though
when they saw a six-car train pull up
on - the canadian pacific hundreds

of men from the local c p r shops
alighted from the train the winni-
peg people felt hopelessly outnumbered

  they also noticed the private car
of william whyte general superin-
tendent of the canadian pacifics
western lines whyte was probably
the most powerful man in western can-
ada at the time a kindly gray-haired
scotchman he was loved and respect-
ed throughout the region but he was
no easy mark he had brought some
special constables of his own

  whyte and his men came up and
looked contemptuously at the crossing
and told joe martin to take it away
martin refused the super declared 

   i dont want to resort to violence
but i will have the crossing removed at
any cost

  at a nod from him the c p r men
got busy taking up crowbars they
approached the track

   hold on there said cox a depu-
ty from winnipeg who was an ex-
poundmaster he laid hands on a
c p r man and tried to stop him an-
other turned swiftly and struck cox

  joe martin called a halt to the battle
and let the c p r dig up the dia-
mond it was put on a flat car and
shipped to the local yards as a souvenir

  within an hour whytes men had
the break in the track repaired then
whyte sent back to winnipeg for an
old teakettle of a locomotive when
it was dragged up he had it unceremo-
niously dumped in the mud at the point
where the local railroaders had built
their right-of-way

however it was not as simple
as all that the winnipeg forces h
retired and sent for all their cabinet

they were given double pay for their

his sleeve he sent for two magistrates 
whom he had in his private car and -

   do you want a dose of live
steam he asked

  winnipeg didnt and withdrew for
five days they waited and gathered re-

then joe martin swore in  more
special constables and ordered up a
troop of provincial police who peace-
ably set up camp

  interest had been roused by this time
all over canada and the united states

which was hoping to get some of can-
adas traffic over the new line called
the c p rs position absurd- in-
effable absurdity  was the way one of
them put it van horne was carica-
tured as the  mogul of monopoly

  the winnipeggers talked all day and
spent several nights trying to put in
a second crossing three attempts
failed and the red river got nothing
for their trouble but battered noses and
barked knuckles both sides began
arming for a siege winnipeg men
took to carrying sticks while whyte
had a barricade built around the c p
r track it was made of heavy boards
and thus immediately named  fort

whyte inside lay the c p r men
alert

  when night came the winnipeg
people disguised as farmers crept up
on the fort armed with staves they
pounded on the barricade with their
staves but nothing happened

  wrhen day came injunctions flashed
to and fro whyte tried to get ottawa
to stop the red river from crossing
its line no word came for a week
another week passed then the news
was announced that ottawa would not
stop the red river valley line but
would help the c p r with a much-
needed bond issue this was on dec
  the war was over every-

model steam engine fittings

                  by vernon smith

here is no doubt about
the superior fascination
of a small steam locomo-
tive compared to a model
propelled by electricity or
other power while it is difficult to
build a working steam locomotive with-
out machine tools it can be done and
if the engine is a good performer she
will be a source of pride and satisfac-
tion to her builder she will be even
more interesting if she is equipped with
the fittings which real engines use

  this article deals with realistic fit-
tings for small steam locomotives
drawings and dimensions are 
gage but can be altered for other sizes

hand and steam sanders fig r
shows the hand sander the
flanged bottom a contains the holes
for the sand ports and the hole for the
pin b in the center the narrow steel
plate which forms the sand valves is
fastened to the pin b by a key which

passes through its hub the sand lever
fits over the square end of pin b and is
fastened by a key also the bottom is
secured in the dome c by four rivets
and sweated around with solder the
two elbows which lead to the sand pipes
are screwed into the bottom plate and
sweated

  holes d are for studs to fasten the
dome to the boiler care should be
taken in filing the slot through which
the sand lever passes so that the lever
is against the slot in front when the
valves are closed the cover on top of
the dome should be loose enough to ad-
mit air but not moisture closed and
open position in fig 

  a steam sander fig  is a simple
thing however the sand trap must not
be placed just below the dome as on
most american engines because of the
moisture condensed from the steam
by placing it low down as on some
foreign engines it will give good re-

pipe from the dome leads into the top
of the tee and a short pipe leads to the
wheel in the other opening is a nozzle
made of  or  od tubing
this should be squeezed down to about
 opening at the point this nozzle
should project into the tee at least half-
way in order to hold the sand from
running out until it receives a jet of
steam which is controlled by a valve in
the cab very fine dry sand must be
used

cylinder relief valves while
not an absolute necessity add
much realism to the small engine the
 click  and the little wisp- of steam
from the valve chest as the throttle
opens are realistic in the extreme
these valves have real uses for they
prevent the cylinder bores and valve
faces from being scratched by dirt and
ashes drawn from the smoke-box when
thejengine is coasting or as railroad
men say  drifting the model will
drift more freely if fitted with relief
valves

  get small oil cups like the one in
fig  from any model firm and drill
a  hole through the cover take
a  steel ball and place it on the
hole on the threaded side of the cover
and give it a sharp rap with a hammer
to make a seat for the valve drop a
 bronze ball into the oil cup screw
the cap on with a smear of red lead
on the threads then screw the relief
valves into the top of the valve cham-
ber on each side of a piston valve en-
gine the valves may be put in front
of the steam chests on a slide valve ma-
chine

  on an o-gage engine the two cylin-
ders can be supplied with air by screw-
ing one valve into the superheater
header back of the smokestack and
thus the air will pass to the cylinders

coupler my model of the sim-
plex coupler is the only small
coupler i know of which opens the
knuckle by jerking the pin-lifting lever

   cut out the coupler body first taking
all measurements from the drawings
fig - sink a straight  hole
as deep as shown in fig  then with
a sharp square file file the inside to the
shape shown on fig  drill holes in
the top and bottom of the coupler and
also cut the hole a in the side of the
head note that the bottom hole is
ahead of the top one

   next make the knuckle fig  and
fit it into the coupler put pin b
through coupler shaft and fit the
knuckle lock fig 

  try the knuckle in the body the
knuckle lock should drop down and
lock the knuckle when open it should
rest on the curved part of the knuckle
a slight amount of trimming may be
necessary to insure a good fit the pur-
pose of the knuckle tail c is to keep the
knuckle from opening too far some
of the tail can be trimmed off when the
coupler is finished

   next make the pin lifter fig 
remove the knuckle from the body and
insert the pin lifter from the top twist-
ing it each way until it goes in side d
should face toward the knuckle now
a good jerk on the pin lifter should
raise the lock and throw the knuckle
open ready for coupling a top view of
the assembled coupler is fig

made very close to scale fig
 externally and will deliver plenty
of water for the average  gage en-
gine it is patterned after pumps which
were used on the lehigh valley r r
years ago with an inside valve gear
the pump can be fastened to the guide
yoke and with an outside valve gear

to the link frame suitable brackets are
fitted to the pump barrel on each side
of the valve chambers to hold the pump
aligned with the lug on the crosshead

  the complete barrel can be filed out
of a piece of brass or turned with a
lathe and then bored out as shown
drill the cross-water passages and tap
out the ends set the pump on a
wooden block and drop a y steel ball
on the discharge valve seat a get a
short piece of rod resting on the ball
and give it a sharp rap with a hammer

  the suction valve seat b is formed
in the same way before being screwed
in then drop in the regular bronze
balls the pins d-d are necessary
to prevent the ball valves from fouling
the passages above the air-chamber
c steadies the flow of water

  the threaded end of the ram is
screwed into the bracket on the cross-
head do not oil the ram but lubricate
with a little tallow the bottom con-
nection is the feed pipe from the ten-
der a by-pass pipe with a valve in it
should be put into the delivery pipe be-
tween the pump and the check valve
when the by-pass is closed all the water
will go into the boiler when open it
will return to the tank

lubricator the lubricator in
-fig  employs the air reservoir as
the oil reservoir the oil feed valve is
just a needle valve which can be bought
from a model supply house pipe a
from the feed valve leads to the cylin-
ders there should always be a grad-
ual slope of the oil pipes

  pipe b is connected to the saturated
steam side of the superheater header
it could be connected to the turret in
the cab but another valve would be re-
quired in order to shut off the steam
when filling the lubricator its action
is as follows steam entering the lubri-

  cator reservoir through pipe b con-
denses and water being heavier than
oil the oil rises and goes out through
the feed valve to the cylinders

  to refill open drain valve c and
drain all water close drain and fill
with oil through plug d the most
suitable grade of oil is capitol steam
cylinder or vacuum  w

   fig  is a regular hydrostatic lubri-

with solder screw in and sweat the
drain valve these drains are just plug
cocks and are cheaper to purchase than
make fit the pipe c which leads to
the needle valve and solder where it
comes through the reservoir

  the needle valve can be made from
brass drilled and tapped out the
stem is made of steel turned up
in a breast drill equalizing pipe
d can then be connected up with
a tee at e a  od pipe
which contains a choke plug f leads to
each cylinder this plug has a 
dia hole for the purpose of preventing
the steam from the equalizing pipe
from filling the cylinders and possibly
moving the engine pipe g connects
to a valve on the steam turret

throttle valve fig i is

of the regular pattern the valve
box a is a piece of brass hollowed and
model steam engine fittings



drilled out dry pipe with elbow b is
put into the boiler from the smoke-box
end the stand pipe c is first screwed
and sweated into the throttle box
guide d for the throttle stem is made
to encircle the stand pipe it should be
slipped up and sweated in place locate
it correctly so the clevis on the stem
does not strike it when it rises

  strap e which carries the fulcrum
for the bell-crank f is fitted to the
stand pipe this strap may be riveted
and sweated to the stand pipe the
throttle valve should be preferably
turned from bronze but if care is taken
it may be built up the saw slot on top
is for grinding in the valve with a
screw-driver valves should be
ground in with pumice and water or
some other fine abrasive the throttle
stem is threaded into the clevis to allow
stem to be unscrewed for grinding in

  the bell-cranks are made of thick
bra plate and all pins passing
through them are riveted over to keep
them from coming out note carefully
that the hole where the throttle clevis
is pinned is made oval-on account of
the angularity of the valve throw this
throttle valve must be entirely as-
sembled before erecting in the dome
with the exception of the throttle rod
g screw the assembly into the elbow
on the dry pipe after a little red lead
has been put on the threads lastly
secure the dome to the boiler by six or
eight studs solder all around

   in fig  is a much simpler throttle
valve of the sliding cone type similar
throttles but with a balancing pilot
valve have been used in russia and
other countries the brass tube a
forms the throttle box into which the
seat b is soldered the cone made of
brass has a stem of bronze screwed and
sweated into it slip a short -gage
wire spring over the stem and also

piece c containing the gland put it
into the throttle box and sweat it there
drill a hole and tap out for pipe d do
not put in this pipe yet set the whole
assembly on end on a wooden block and
give the stem a tap with a hammer

   put a hole the size of the throttle
box in the back of the dome and fit a
flange that will make a flat face on it
smear a little red lead on the threads
of the stand pipe and screw on the
throttle box until it is tight and until
the hole for pipe d is on top screw in
and sweat this pipe

vhistle many small locomo-
tives with real steam whistles
have them mounted under running
boards deck plates and other strange
places due to the fact that they are out
of proportion this is unnecessary
the whistle in fig  is so little over-
size that it may be mounted on top of
the boiler of a  gage engine by set-
ting it at a slight angle obtain a plug
cock flatten its handle and drill a hole
in the handle for the whistle rod the
bowl a is made of brass drilled out in
the inside and finished on the outside

   screw the plug cock into the bottom
and solder file out a u-shaped piece
shown in black with a hole in its top
side to take the bolt which forms the
whistle stem file the bolt head so it
fits tightly between the legs of the u-
shaped piece slip the pin b through
the whistle bowl and the u-shaped
piece rivet lightly and solder make a
disk of such a size that will leave a slit
not over  wide all around the
whistle bowl the bell of the whistle is
made of a brass cartridge that measures
about  od fit a threaded top
and lock nut to the whistle bell to allow
for its adjustment on the whistle stem
lubricate the plug cock often with

  lost river

by a leslie

ex-fireman and brakeman author of civil war etc

these men were devils-
they were like the murder-
ous rocks and threatening
canyons in which they lived

wl t was night a night of rain
ifcbj anc wnc and rming thun-
ld der el infierno verde
writhed under the almost
continuous lightning glare
lost river foamed in its straight-
walled canyon the very mountains
seemed to shudder under the pounding
of the elements

  bl infierno verde-the green hell
an incompleted railroad stretched lin-
gers of steel toward the hills and can-
yons and roaring streams with the
railroad would come something of law
and something of order for this wild

land el infierno verde would no
longer be sanctuary for hunted men
south of the rio grande

  but the three men in the dimly lit cab
of an engine pounding toward lost
river canyon were not thinking of
outlaws that night their attention
was riveted on an airplane that was at-
tempting to ride the storm

   he wont make it muttered old
harry barkus who held the is
throttle

  brakeman  slim  hollins standing
beside him nodded agreement  i
reckon not he responded


  dick farnol the fireman said noth-
ing but his gray eyes did not leave the
pinpoints of light that reeled and tossed
over the black hills beyond the canyon

   no plane ever built could stay in
the air on a night like this declared
barkus  what do you spose they
meant by sending out a pilot in such
weather

   those mexicans are likely to do
anything said hollins

  the wind raged against the cab sides
billowing up from the tender the end
curtain which dick had weighted down

    with lumps of coal drops of
    water hissed on the hot jacket a
    blinding flash of lightning was
    followed by a roll of thunder
    suddenly dick exclaimed

        there he goes

       leaning far out the cab win-
dow heedless of the driving rain he
watched the mail plane lights rush
downward like a falling star they
winked out behind a spire of stone an
instant later the stone was outlined by
a leaping glow dick drew back and
the three railroaders stared into each
others whitening faces

   cant-cant we do somethin to
help him quavered old harry

  dick shook his head  fell other
side the canyon he said tersely  no
way for us to get across-thirty miles
around through the hills besides if


railroad stories

he stayed with the crate hes burned to
a cinder by now

   mebbe he used his parachute
slim suggested

   perhaps but if so hed have a
mighty small chance of coming
through these rocks dont make what
youd call an ideal landing field to say
nothing of the wind

   guess youre right agreed bar-
kus  well report it when we get in
and they can send out a searching party
one things certain some folks aint
gonna get the letters theyre expectin
silence fell for several minutes dick
built up his fire which had been ne-
glected during the tenseness of the avi-
ators impending crash the tall fire-
man watched the needle of the pressure
gage crawl up toward  and nodded
to old harry to give her the  gun

  as barkus dragged his injector han-
dle back water began gurgling through
the intake pipe he spoke to dick who
was now climbing onto the seat box

   seein that feller go down reminds
me of somethin i heard over to the
yard office yestday they told me the
old man is figgerin on usin planes to
send men and light materials across el
infierno verde to where the south line
is buildin this way

   jaggers dunn is liable to do any-
thing said slim  he aint like no
general manager i ever heard tell of
before

   he run the c  p up from a sin-
gle-track streak o rust to a system cov-
erin a lot of the states and canada
commented the engineer

   yeah and now this line into mexi-
co slim added  guess hell be bridg-
ing the pacific to china next

barkus eased the reverse bar
down a notch  two as the grade
stiffened and remarked sententiously

 i heard somethin else bout that air-
plane business

  yeah whats that

   the old mans decided to give
shacks and tallowpots on this line a
chance to learn about airplanes seein
as the road is gonna use em anybody
what wants to slim can volunteer
and the reglar pilots will teach em
how to fly the danged things

  hollins gave a long whistle  ex-
cuse me them sky-rolling gondolas
dont answer to brakes the way they
had oughter you hear anything bout
it dick

  yes the fireman answered
 trainmaster told me about it the first
of the week he added after a pause
 i signed up to be a student pilot
slim whistled again old harry
shook his head in wordless disapproval
the  stuttered as her drivers slipped
on the wet rails

  slower and slower boomed the labor-
ing exhaust dick humored and petted
his fire barkus jockeyed bar and
throttle with the consummate skill of a
veteran of mountain divisions the
brakeman strained his eyes for the jut-
ting cliff that marked the top of the
grade

  barkus poked his head out the crack
of his side window like a mud turtle
peering from its shell he growled as
the driving rain stung his face

   almost there he shouted  got
anything for the hill siding slim

    not this time thank the lord re-
plied the brakeman  we will-hold
her harry theres a flag

  the engineer slammed the throttle
shut dropped the bar to the corner and
reached for the brake valve handle he
swore as he banked his window open

   of all the blankety-blank-blank
places to stop us now what you sup-
pose they want up here
lost river



   several hundred yards ahead a red
light swung across the track

   barkus ground his train to a stop and
waited still growling dick and the
brakeman leaned back comfortably
eyeing the approaching lantern through
the rain-spattered windows the apron
creaked as the unseen flagman mounted
the steps

   old harry turned on his seatbox
gazing toward the dusky gangway

    now what in hell- he began

   his voice died to a gurgle that was
drowned in the harsh accents of the
man with the lantern

   elevate the three of you get
em up high i said

   barkus gloved hands shot above his
head hollins raked his fingers against
the cab roof dick farnol slowly
raised muscular hands to a level with
his shoulders his gray eyes probed the
face and form of the masked man in
th gangway coming to rest at last on
the heavy revolver which menaced the
occupants of the cab

    feller you sure picked a swell
crowd to stick up drawled the lean-
jawed fireman  youd do better
knocking over a blind mans cup and
pencils

   thatll be bout enough funny
cracks outa you snarled the gunman

 you shet yore mouth and open yore
ears

    what-what you want  quavered
old harry

    i want you tuh do some tall listen-
in answered the masked man he
glared from the shadow of his low-
pulled hat brim  now get this he
went on sharply  you aint gonna
run this damn railroad across el inficr-
no verde if you try things are gonna
happen-damn unpleasant things-like
that airplane what just went down
understand

    but-but protested barkus  we
aint got no say about where the rail-
road goes

    yeah well pass the word on to
them what has now hold this contrap-
tion wheah it is for five minutes and be
sho you know how tuh count up tuh
five he backed toward the steps gun
alert paused and glowered at the fire-
man  you got anything tuh say bout
it smart hombre f

   dicks steady eyes bored into the
shadow beneath the hat brim

    i was just remembering he re-
plied coolly  that all the jiggers i ever
saw wearing tied-down holsters never
lived very long

   the masked man stiffened the muz-
zle of the big gun jutted forward then
apparently thinking better of the sud-
den impulse he grunted something un-
intelligible and backed out of sight the
railroaders heard his boots clatter on
the steps crunch against the ballast
and he was gone

at ibarra fifteen miles farther
-south where the  pulled her
long material train into the yards en-
gineer barkus and his crew told their
versions of the airplane crash and the
visit from the mysterious masked fig-
ure to an interested audience the
division superintendent was there the
trainmaster a couple of construction
engineers and the supers chief clerk

   the super got busy on the telephone
ordering out a special train loaded with
bulls and brawny section hands to
search for the missing aviator while
he was barking instructions over the
phone the office door opened and a
truly remarkable individual entered
james g  jaggers  dunn general
manager of the c  p

   stocky broad-shouldered with cold
blue eyes and a crinkly mane of white


railroad stories

hair he instantly dominated the little
group of trainmen and officials

   mr barkus ordered the superin-
tendent  start at the beginning and
tell mr dunn the whole story

  general manager dunn listened
without comment when old harry
had finished he turned a chill gaze upon
the super

   well he inquired  what have
you done about it

  superintendent hallihan explained
briefly that he had just sent out a
searching party as for the masked
mans threat he was not inclined to
take it too seriously he turned to a
grizzled construction engineer

   what do you think of it carney 
carney frowned  my opinion is
were in for trouble ive worked in
this country before and i know the kind
of people that hang out in el infierno
verde they dont make a business of
talking through their hats id say take
precautions

    think wed better get in touch with
the mexican government authorities
mr dunn asked hallihan

  jaggers dunn snorted disapproval
 we cant look to that government for
anything he grumbled  i used a lot
of influence to get this road-building
concession one of the express stipula-
tions was that we must solve our own
problems handle our own difficulties
the government holds that what hap-
pens on our land grants is none of its
affair

  he turned to old harry

   now mr barkus i want a good
description of that bad man whos go-
ing to stop us from building a railroad
what did he look like

   gosh mr dunn stammered old
harry  i dunno ceptin he was tall
and kinda broad he was all masked
up

  general manager dunn grunted dis-
gustedly how about you he shot
at hollins what did you see

  slim grinned  i didnt see any-
thing much but that gun he admitted

   that is certainly illuminating
commented jaggers dryly  did you
happen to notice the stranger he
asked the fireman

  dick farnol raised his steady gaze to
meet the gms hard eyes  yes i be-
lieve i did he replied quietly

  jaggers stared for an instant
 think you can add anything to what
weve just heard about his appear-
ance

  dick nodded  he was an inch or so
over six feet i should judge big and
bony his eyes were either black or a
very dark blue he wore a regulation
sombrero pulled down low and had a
blue silk handkerchief tied around jhe
lower part of his face from the way
the cloth bulged out id say hes got a
hawk-bill nose there was a jagged
white scar bout the size of a dime near
the corner of his left eye-bullet
wound it looked like there was a
knife scar across the back of his right
hand

  the listeners gaped with astonish-
ment as dick continued the description 

   he wore a blue flannel shirt vest
swinging open and bat-wing chaps he
carried two smith  wesson single-
action sixes in tied-down holsters but
his right shoulder was a bit higher than
his left so i figure hes used that right-
hand gun a long time and frequent
keeping the left one as a sorta reserve
battery and isnt a real two-gun man
dick hunched one shoulder to illustrate
his point  talked in a deep rumbling
voice but when i made him sore he
come up a coupla notches and the
chances are thats his reglar speaking
voice talked bad-and is bad
lost

river



  good lord gasped jaggers
u how the devil did you come to notice
all that

    i use my eyes is all

   and you can just bet young man
im going to keep an eye on you mut-
tered the g m under his breath

a few minutes later after the en-
ginemen had left the office dunn
inquired of his division superintendent
 who is that fellow anyhow

   on the time sheet as richard far-
nol replied hallihan  been with us
three years ever since we started build-
ing the road and hired some new men
along with those we brought down
from the states

  carney the construction engineer
spoke up  farnol was a cowboy be-
fore he took to railroading he worked
on ranches in arizona and down
through this tough sinaloa country
h quite a reputation as a quick-draw
man seems hed just sorta hunch his
shoulder and the gun was out of the
holster and in his hand

  mr dunn was thoughtful

   got the hands and got the eyes
he mused almost to himself seeming
to forget for a moment the other occu-
pants of the office

  he had forgotten them in fact for
jaggers was thinking of the days of his
own wild youth when he too had been
a rider of the purple sage and he was
thinking of men he had known then
men of the old west whose eyes were
of the same cold gray as dick farnols

in the meanwhile dick farnol also
was doing some serious thinking
like carney he did not under-rate the
mysterious menace under different
circumstances and in another locality
it would have been absurd but present
circumstances were unusual and el in-

fierno verde was also unusual as dick
had once observed to harry barkus

   when they finished building the
world they had a lot of odds and ends
left over that just naturally wouldnt
fit in any place so they dumped the
whole lot down here and never tried to
sort it out

   yes el infierno verde was like that
and the men living among those mur-
derous rocks and snarling canyons
were just the kind of devils the green
hell needed to complete its picture

    this railroading game sure doesnt
lack excitement dick told himself as
he mulled over the happenings of the
night  well guess i havent anything
to kick about

  dick farnol had taken up railroad-
ing for two reasons one was the
promise of excitement and interest
the other was that dick was not con-
tent to spend all his days as a forty-a-
month-and-found cowpuncher he saw
in the new railroad jaggers dunn was
building across mexico opportunity
he had read an article on mr dunns
life and had reasoned 

  if one cow chambermaid can get to
be general manager of a big railroad
why cant another one get to be some-
thing in that business too

  whereupon he had gotten him a job
firing and for the past three years had
been  keeping em hot  as the mexi-
can extension of the c  p crawled
down across the state of sonora and
into wild and mountainous sinaloa

  now the  high iron  had reached
the edge of el infierno verde while
fifty miles to the south and beyond the
far side of the green hell the twin
ribbons of the other line crept north
somewhere out there in that weird land
of black rock and white water the two
lines would meet and the c  p be-
come a thing complete


railroad stories

   but therell be hell a-plenty fore
that happens dick predicted as he
settled down to sleep

  feller youll do all right
pete reeves said with enthusi-
asm  you just nacherly got the feel
of the air some have it right from the
start and some never get it at all pity
you werent in aviation service during
the war youd have got your share of
fokkers what outfit were you with 
without taking his attention from
the distant skyline by which he was
holding a level course dick farnol re-
plied to the pilots question

   french foreign legion

   huh you saw your share of hell
then ease up on the stick a bit thats
it now kick her to the right and well
take a look at the river wow that
was a good one

  the big two-seater had slumped with
an abrupt vibrating jar then leveled
off again the pilot chuckled as dick
glanced at him inquiringly

   air over the canyon is fulla
bumps he explained  cant see em
but theyre there just the same

   needs ballast said dick  by the
way did they ever find that airman
who crashed the other night

   yeah was the reply  dead
rocking and lurching the plane
roared on even in the enclosed cabin
conversation was difficult and dick
and his companion were silent for some
time suddenly the pilot leaned for-
ward

   say he exclaimed  that river
runs right into the ground

   sure it does dick agreed
 thats lost river disappears under
those cliffs and if it ever comes out
again nobody knows where

   why doesnt somebody follow it
up in a boat and find out 

   government engineers did go
through the canyon once i believe and
heard the roar of a high falls just in-
side the cave if a boat went inside it
would go over the falls and be lost
nice place all right straighten
her out again and well head on across
the bad lands for arturo

at arturo northern terminal of the

-	south line reeves talked with
the c  p landing field superin-
tendent

    that fellow farnol is a real find
the pilot declared  hes got the mak-
ins of a crack flyer or im a billygoat
only been up three times and he han-
dles the crate like a veteran sure wish
we could get him into the service

   well perhaps we can arrange it
answered the superintendent  i imag-
ine mr dunn would let us have him if
i made a personal request

  no chance said pete ruefully
 i mentioned it to farnol he just
grinned that tight-lipped grin of his
and said he preferred the cab of a loco-
motive-where there was a chance for
some real excitement

  the air super was indignant  ex-
citement  what do those ground crawl-
ers know about excitement their
work is about as exciting as washing
socks

    aint so sure bout that disagreed
pete  i had a ride with farnol and
that old bewhiskered hellion barkus
over the new north line the other day
seems they needed some dynamite and
stuff at the camp south of ibarra and
barkus had orders to hurry

   well

  well he hurried all right and
fore he got through twistin round
them hairpin curves and bangin over
them half-finished trestles id done

 ill do my travelin by air hereafter
 thank you

 tut at that moment plenty of ex-
 citement was in the making for
 the c  p dick flew back to ibarra
 with pete the following morning he
 found the yards seething a grand row
 was going on in the trainmasters office

     i tell you they were spotted on the
 hill malin the check clerk was say-
 ing  i have bantons wheel report
 and besides banton personally men-
 tioned spotting them there

    send for banton shouted train-
 master farley who was a powerful
 man with a shock of blond hair and
 a firm determined chin

   banton appeared shortly rubbing
 the sleep from his eyes he was a
 lanky veteran of the crummy who was
 not in the least awed by trainmasters
 or superintendents

    if this aint one helluva note he
 stormed  draggin a man outa bed in
 the middle of his rest cant you guys
 run this office without callin on the
 train service to help

     forget it said the trainmaster
 farley had at one time twirled a
 brake club under the old con and knew
 how to handle him

    this isnt any joking matter
 sam the t m went on  are you
 sure you spotted c  p   and
 c  p   at the lost river hill
 siding

   banton was downright disgusted at
 this question  dont my wheel report
 tell vou where i spotted em

  yes but-

  but what you think i cant make
out a report correct you think i dont
know what i do with my train  say-

  but sam broke in farley des-
pairingly they aint there

 if they aint there some crew

river	

musta picked em up and set em off at
one of the camps or run em back here
to ibarra why dont you hunt em up
stead of botherin me

we have been hunting theyre
not at ibarra and theyre not at any of
the camps theyre gone thats all
banton was bewildered  but where
did they go 

    thats what i want to know sam
are you sure you really had those
cars

    am i sure the conductor ex-
ploded  am i-why you-

    never mind sam never mind in-
terrupted farley hastily  im not
blaming you for anything but when
two carloads of badly needed dynamite
vanish into thin air you cant blame me
for being kinda upset

    the thought of that much dyna-
mite floating around loose somewhere
isnt comforting either added the
check clerk

   dick left the trainmasters office in
a thoughtful mood there had been
conjectures a-plenty regarding the van-
ished dynamite but nobody had men-
tioned the thing dick was thinking
about

   the tall- firemans mind was going
back to that wild night a few weeks
back when a pilot had died in his flam-
ing crate and a mysterious masked man
had invaded the s cab

 that jigger meant business dick
told himself  ill bet my last peso hes
mixed up in this dynamite case looks
like real trouble is just starting

tvick was right three days later
a light construction engine van-
ished from the camp five miles south of
lost river siding and with her went
the mexican engine watchman leaving
no clue as to the manner of going of
either man or machine


railroad stories

   its utterly absurd declared
trainmaster farley  a twenty-ton
locomotive doesnt sprout wings and
fly away and she doesnt sink into the
ground either without leaving a hole

  superintendent hallihan had an in-
spiration  she might sink into the
water

   she might admitted farley run-
ning one hand through his thick hair
 but how could she get into the
water

   ill tell you how said hallihan
after a moments thought  if i re-
member rightly at one place lost
river siding runs within fifty feet of
the water just before the river enters
the canyon wouldnt it be possible for
someone to swing out the rails there
drop in a couple of lengths of steel and
run the engine into the river water
is deep

  a buzz of comment filled the office
the deep voice of mr farley expressed
the general opinion

   id say its worth investigating

old harry barkus and dick far-
nol made a run with a special
train from ibarra to lost river siding
in record time besides the supers car
the  hauled a flat car onto which a
small boat chains cables and grappling
hooks had been loaded the  pulled
into the siding the railroad men
leaped out of the train and went over
the track with keenly scrutinizing eyes

   hard to tell whether anything has
been tampered with grunted halli-
han  new ties new rails-construc-

tion marks still plain on both rained
last night too and enough water
passes down this low embankment to
wash away any signs there

   no matter said farley  if the
engine went into the river shell be on
the bottom she wouldnt float away
thats certain

  the boat was launched grapplings
were set to work back and forth
across the muddy river the little craft
worked-with barren results

  finally hallihan called a halt

   guess i switched onto the wrong
track he admitted  theres no en-
gine in this river-cars either back
upstream boys were getting too close
to that cave mouth for pleasure with
the current this strong just listen to
the roar of the falls

  dick farnol had not made one of the
boats crew after banking his fire
carefully he sauntered along the sid-
ing examining rails and ties he cov-
ered the entire stretch of track and dis-
covered nothing undiscouraged he
started back walking slowly and stoop-
ing from time to time

  the siding paralleling the course of
the river was curved near the begin-
ning of the curve where the steel was
less than a dozen yards from the
waters edge dick paused

  something caught his eye it was but
a small thing in itself nothing more
outstanding than the head of a spike
but in one respect that spike was dif-
ferent from its fellows

  the protruding side of the spike
head that should have gripped down
against the rail flange was broken off
dick squatted beside the rail and ran
his fingers along the ragged edge

   chipped off by a hammer sure as
blazes  and its a brand-new break
the broken edge was clean and gray
unspecked by rust  somebody
lost river	hi

the disgusted crapplers
returned empty-handed

mauled that spike in hot twenty-four
hours ago the fireman decided
 wasnt a track walker either-hed
have put in a new spike when this one
broke now what else can i find
for some minutes he went over the
vicinity of the broken spike with great
care at length he sat down on a tie
end shaking his head dubiously

  half an hour later when the dis-
gusted grapplers climbed the muddy
bank dick grinned ruefully to himself
 lucky that bet of mine was a
strictly private affair but who the
devil broke that spike

farnol was not the only one to
ask questions general manager
dunn arrived in ibarra that night and
asked a number superintendent hal-
lihan and his aides got no pleasure out
of answering them in fact they did
not answer most of them and jaggers
comments were vivid and to the point

  a week passed and nothing was
heard of either cars or engine dick
continued to fire the material train and
on off days took flying lessons

  one saturday afternoon he made a
flight to arturo with pete reeves and
while the pilot attended to routine busi-


railroad stories

ness at the field dick wandered about
the old mexican town

  as dusk was falling he entered the
dining room of a posado and ordered
a meal the innkeeper himself served
the  senor from the railroad  and
after a few moments conversation in
spanish which dick spoke fluently
left his guest to enjoy a really good
dinner

  the railroad man did ample justice
to the meal and then leaned back com-
fortably in his chair for some time he
idly watched the other diners the ma-
jority of them were dark-faced mexi-
cans with the stains of hard labor on
hands and clothes

   seated at a table near a window was
a small man whose movements were
quick and furtive he was not unlike a
dozen others scattered about the room
except that his face was disfigured by
an old and badly healed knife wound
the scar wide and livid ran from the
corner of his left eye to the point of
his chin

   dick stared at the disfigurement with
curious eyes

    dont tell me theres two jiggers
in the same country wearing a slash
like that he decided rising from his
chair and striding across the room he
paused beside the little mans table

    hello pablo he greeted

   the other looked up quickly his eyes
dilating senor-senor he stam-
mered  i-i not know you

  yeah well i know you pablo
youre the watchman who had charge
of that construction engine  the
night she disappeared

  color drained from the scarred
mans face leaving it a dirty gray  i
-i not understand he faltered

   no well i dont either but i
want to what became of that engine
pablo

   senor i cannot tell you i dare
not

  why not pablo dick persisted

 somebody got you scared

  the mans voice became a mere
whisper  senor i-i- the voice
rose to a reedy shriek  bl cascabel

dick turned toward where the
mans horror-filled gaze was di-
rected he caught a glimpse of a tall
fellow slipping out the door a crash
behind him brought his attention back
to pablo

   the table was vacant the chair over-
turned the window was a jagged ruin
of shattered glass and splintered frame
dick vaulted through the opening stag-
gered to his knees and surged erect

  it was a dark night ramshackle
houses of adobe-sun-dried brick-
loomed shadowy against the stajs
from the street on which the posado
fronted came sounds of revelry effec-
tually drowning the footsteps of the
fugitive dick shook his head in dis-
gust and made for the dimly fighted
street

  the tall man who had so terrorized
pablo also had vanished dick re-en-
tered the inn paid his bill and silenced
the chatter of the proprietor with a
curt word

   i didnt break the window but
heres the price of a new one now
forget the whole business si

    assuredly yes senor si si i heard
a name spoken senor and the less one
knows or speaks where that name is
concerned the better si

   what about the man who owns
that name

  the innkeepers black eyes dulled
his face assumed a wooden expression
he shrugged his shoulders expressively
and took refuge behind that expression
beyond which it is useless to probe
lost river



   quien sabef who knows

  dick left the inn and for some min-
utes stood gazing toward the distant
lights of the flying field

   bl cascabel he mused  in good
united states that means  the rattle-
snake which doesnt sound so good i
just got a eye-cornerful of that gent
who eased out the door but id bet my
next salary that he had a hook nose and
a scar longside his eye judging from
the way pablo acted up that guy is bl
cascabel in person and unless im mak-
ing a big mistake bl cascabel is the
bad talking hombre who wished him-
self into the is cab that night
the tall fireman chuckled sardoni-
cally as he made his way toward the
flying field

   well named all right he rattled
kinda hard that night and hes sure
been doing some striking

it was well after midnight before the
plane getting away to a late start
grounded at the ibarra flying field but
dick went straight to general manager
dunns private car his way was
barred by a sleepy and protesting por-
ter

   honest t goodness boss yo-all
caint come in now mistuh dunn done
be soun sleep is gonna cotch big
trouble if i wake him up

   what ive got to say to him is im-
portant cant wait dick insisted

   clah boss i caint do it he take
mah haid plumb-oh lawdy lawdy
now look what yo-all went an done
from fthe interior of the coach
came an angry bellow  george
whats going on out there whats
the meaning of that racket

  shoving the darky aside dick strode
into the car

   its farnol is fireman mr
dunn sorry to disturb you but what

ive got to tell you is too important to
wait until morning

  a door banged loudly and general
manager dunn in dressing gown and
slippers appeared his snowy mane
was tousled but his blue eyes were
keenly alert

   make it short young man he
ordered waving dick to a chair

  dick told his story in as few words
as possible jaggers made a caustic re-
mark or two then sat silent for some
minutes

   so thats the way the situation
stands he broke forth at length  a
locomotive vanishes and the watchman
goes with her then the watchman
turns up a week later fifty miles away
and dives through a window yelling
about snakes of all the damned non-
sense ever wished on a respectable rail-
road young man have you any idea
where that engine went

   no sir dick admitted  but i
think i know where the answer is

   where damn it

   in lost river

  the g m arched his bushy eye-
brows  lost river hallihan tells
me he dragged that stream above the
canyon and inside the canyon to where
it enters a cave and goes over a falls
he says the water runs flush with the
sides of the canyon and that the sides
are straight-up-and-down five hundred
high how could the answer to this
conundrum be in lost river

   i dont know yet sir came the re-
ply but im confident its there ill
tell you why

  jaggers listened without interruption
to the story of the broken spike head

   you saw what the rest of them
overlooked he commented when dick
had finished  well what do you sug-
gest 

  the fireman hesitated a moment be-


railroad stories

fore making the request he had been
pondering over for some time

   i have a theory mr dunn he
said at last  and id like to test it out
but i cant do so and take my run out
each day

  jaggers dunn drew  pad of paper
toward him and scrawled a few words
he tore off the sheet handed it to far-
nol

   this will give you all the freedom
of action you need he stated  now
go to it

   ill do the best i can sir dick
promised

   would the use of one of our air-
planes help you the general manager
wanted to know

  dick smiled but shook his head
 no sir i dont think so the planes
are all right in their place but this is
a real railroading problem and the only
way well get to the bottom of the mat-
ter is by railroading methods all ill
need a plane for is to get across el
infierno verde in a hurry now and then
until after the road is built across

  as dick was leaving jaggers called
a final question  you dont figure that
engine went down the river and over
the falls in some way

  dick paused at the door  that was
a comparatively light engine sir did
you happen to think it might have gone
up the river

  by godfrey rumbled jaggers
 thats an idea

  he nodded sagely to the combination
porter-chef who had grown gray in his
service   it isnt the iron and the wood
and the steel and the steam that make a
railroad george its the brains and the
muscle and the nerve its the men that
count george its the men

   yassuh yassuh agreed the por-
ter with a complacent glance at his
own shining countenance reflected in a

nearby mirror  is gotta say mistuh
dunn you sho knows how t pick
em

 smart hombre 

mid-morning found dick on
his regular run with old harry
barkus and slim hollins as the 
thundered north with her long string
of empties bound for zapata sixty
miles distant dick was silent and pre-
occupied continually he scanned tur-
bulent lost river upon whose banks
the road was built-but with barren
results

  desolate deserted the tawny streanj
wound between threatening hills here
and there the narrow valley widened
out and the water cut a sluggish path
through heat-bleached sands again
the closing walls of a canyon hung
threateningly over the twin ribbons of
steel

  as the miles dropped behind one by
one dick was obsessed by a growing
disgust

   fifty miles and not a thing that
looks suspicious he meditated
 wonder if im following a cold trail
after all

  old harry tightened his loosening
belt and widened the throttle a notch or
two the veteran was growing hungry

   keep her hot big boy he called to
dick  were goin to town now

  dick grinned back and jerked his
shoulder toward the safety valve
where a feathery  squirrel tail  of
steam drifted lazily back over the hogs
back and said

   right up against the peg
lost river



  barkus hooked the bar a little higher
as the long train dipped over a slight
rise and roared on toward zapata
which was seated in a cuplike basin and
a few miles off the rivers course

   ill be glad when this run-

  the words were chipped off theold
hoggers hands flew to throttle auto-
matic air lever reverse bar sand
blowers

   get ready t leave her he shouted
to fireman and brakeman

  slim hollins leaped for the gangway
and hung poised on the lowest step
dick leaned out the cab window his
steady gray eyes fixed on the jumbled
mass of stone and earth toward which
the engine rushed with screeching
brakes drivers spinning in reverse and
stack thundering

  with all the skill and knowledge of
a veteran of thirty years old harry
fought to save his train jockeying air
throttle bar and sand the  lurched
and bucked as the shove of her long
train hurled her down the grade glit-
tering sparks and clouds of sand dust
boomed out from the gripping brake
shoes couplings clanged and rattled

  steady dick shouted to the
brakeman  those rocksll make damn
hard landing

  the brake shoes were gripping tight
wheels were sliding on the sanded
rails dick braced his feet against the
boilerhead and waited

  there was a crash a jolting lurch
barkus shoved the throttle shut and re-
leased the air

   busted pilot is all i guess he told
farnol  not bad for an old man
eh

   you could stop her on a ten-cent
piece if you had to dick compli-
mented as they climbed from the cab
and went forward to view the damage

   how in hell did a slide ever come

down here demanded barkus queru-
lously  that cliff looks solid as the
rock of gibraltar

  dick pointed silently to where the
fallen mass had cleaved away from the
cliff the engineer took one look and
raved

   dynamited loose sure as fire you
can see the marks the drill left plain as
anything now who in the devil-
harry barkus never finished the sen-
tence instead he stared at the broken
cliff face with bulging eyes

  scrawled across the clean gray sur-
face-a dark smudge of crudely
formed letters-was a sinister warn-
ing

   smart hombre keep your damn nose
  outa things what dont consarn you

   smart hombre repeated old har-
ry in a low voice  dick wasnt that
what the jigger who stuck us up on
lost river hill called you

after hours of delay the 

-	reached zapata dick obtained an
interview with the trainmaster back-
ing up his request with the tersely
worded written order of jaggers dunn
the result was that when the 
headed back to ibarra a fireman from
the extra board sat in her cab and old
harry grumbled accordingly

  at dusk three days later dick far-
nol arrived at ibarra he was weary
footsore and half starved and he was
more than disgusted

   i went over the river on foot from
zapata here he told jaggers dunn
 and i couldnt find a thing promising
looks like my bright idea is a flop

   dont be too sure the g m dis-
agreed  whoever is at the bottom of
this is shrewd and utterly ruthless the
attempt to wreck your train proves
that moreover it looks like they know


railroad stories

you are showing more than an ordi-
nary interest in the business be care-
ful son dont take unnecessary risks
now get some rest youll think
clearer in the morning

  dick went to bed and was soon in
the land of slumber before daylight
someone hammered on his door the
fireman leaped out of bed yawned a
second and stretched his arms the
hammering continued he opened the
door and greeted a redheaded call boy
 well what is it

    they want you at the supers office
 pronto the caller said

   o k reds dick responded
 be there right away

   he dressed and hurried over to hal-
lihans office the super was in the
room so were the trainmaster other
minor officials and jaggers dunn the
trainmasters mop of hair was more un-
ruly than usual evidently he too had
been called out of bed in a hurry

    heres a fine mess growled halli-
 han  three camp cars stolen worse
 than that they were occupied by sixty
 men asleep in their bunks on the tres-
 tle camp siding five miles south of lost
 river canyon-and the men have van-
 ished too gone just like the  and
 the dynamite

   jaggers dunn looked inquiringly at
dick the fireman was about to speak
when an uproar sounded in the outer
office a moment later the night yard-
master entered dragging with him an
excited young mexican who was pro-
testing in broken english

    senor i no mean be left behind
si i run-i run with ze great speed

i what you call heem beller-i cry
out caramba ze loco accursed she
do not stop i not want losa job i
catch train come here i explain

    what in- began jaggers

   the yardmaster interrupted  best

as i can make out mr dunn this bird
belonged in them missin camp cars
hed been visitin a senorita or some-
thing and got back just in time to see
them pulling out the siding thought
the cars had been ordered somewhere
and is afraid hell lose his job because
he didnt go along

   tell him not to worry jaggers
said grimly  i guess hes the only one
of the sixty that has got a job now
what do you make of all this gentle-
men

   dick farnol spoke to the mexican
youth  muchacho did you see the
number of that engine

   the mexican nodded his head with
great emphasis  assuredly capitan
i see heem the number he is 

out of the turmoil in the division
superintendents office emerged
one fact of value el cascabel-or
whoever was responsible for the latest
outrage-was able not only to steal a
construction engine among other
things but also to return the engine at
will probably with further depreda-
tions against the c  p in mind

   this startling bit of information
prompted dick farnol to investigations
in a new field he requested a detailed
report from all construction engineers
and section foremen accounting for
rails and track-laying material the
results more than satisfied his expecta-
tions	-

    almost a carload of rails short at
camp three he told jaggers dunn

 to say nothing of ties fishplates
spikes and tools whoever swiped em
did so a little at a time so they would
not be missed

   jaggers grunted with indignation
a nice state of affairs i must say
lets see now camp three is between
here and lost river canyon isnt it
lost river



    yes sir said dick  it is the
trestle siding camp and it was for-
merly located at the hill siding right
where lost river canyon begins
thats when the materials were stolen

i	figure

a grim and ghostly place was lost
river canyon on a moonlight
night its mighty spires of stone were
flung up against the pale sky like giant
hands the gloomy gorge was brimful
of shadows until the moon reached
mid-heaven then it was a silver shim-
mer of uncertain radiance that dis-
torted objects and gave them an elusive
unreal quality

   to the lonely watcher huddled on the
lip of an abruptly down-flinging wall
the scene was fantastic the dim rattle
of a passing train on the nearby rail-
road seemed a faraway sound from
another world in the depths below the
rushing torrent of lost river was a
white delusion possessing nothing of
substance

  this was the third shivering
cramped night dick farnol had spent
on the canyon wall his sleep-weary
eyes strained toward the foaming
water searching for-he was not sure
what firm in his belief that the solu-
tion of the c  ps disquieting mys-
tery lay somewhere in or about the
canyon he was resolved to stick it out
despite discomfort until something of
value materialized

   dick shifted his position craned his
neck to look upstream suddenly he
forgot the ache of cramped muscles

  near the canyon mouth a black dot
had appeared it swiftly grew larger
a faint putt-putt echoed and re-echoed
from wall to wall dick instinctively
shrank back into the shadow tense with
excitement

   on came the sputtering black dot it

swept by directly beneath the watching
fireman hurried downstream toward
where the cave mouth which received
the stream yawned blackly

   a gasoline launch dick said un-
der his breath  and a big one at that
looks like its heading straight for the
cave for the love of pete dont they
know about the falls

  an almost overpowering urge to
shout a warning drummed in his mind
some instinct spoke against it

   chances are they couldnt hear me
anyhow he murmured  there they
go

  the launch had vanished only the
hiss of the racing water and the mutter
of the falls disturbed the canyons
hush dick farnol on his lofty perch
was thinking furiously from that
period of thought came a momentous
decision

   that launch went right along like
it knew exactly where it was going he
reasoned  if those jiggers didnt
know what they were doing why would
they be prowling around lost river at
this time o night something darned
funny about that cave

  dick left the canyon made his way
stiffly to the railroad soon a string of
empties came pounding up the grade
the fireman swung aboard a box car
thankfully discovered a pile of straw in
one corner and pulled together a bed
that seemed luxury itself after hours of
trying to find the soft side of a cold
rock

  the clicking wheels lulled him to
sleep and he awoke only as the train
was pulling into arturo forty-five
miles up-river

dick spent a busy day and ended
up just as dusk was falling at a
straggling indian village that perched
precariously on the shelving bank of


railroad stories

lost river a few miles below arturo
here money changed hands and the
fireman procured what he needed satis-
fied at the same time that no one in
arturo was aware of his intentions

  dark found a small skiff racing
downstream dick farnol crouched in
the stern steering the unstable craft
with a paddle he chuckled softly as
he avoided jagged fangs of stone by the
barest margin it would be touch and
go all the way to the canyon and
then-

  dawn was not yet in the sky when
the little boat entered the gloomy
reaches of lost river canyon a
faintly phosphorescent glow etched the
surface of the stream but otherwise the
darkness was intense dick gripped his
steering paddle firmly as the thunder of
the falls grew louder

  abruptly the thunder changed to a
hollow boom the boat was inside the
cave dick shifted the paddle to his
left hand his right fumbled a moment
and the bright beam of an electric flash-
light cut the shadows

  he blinked at the shaft of light the
boat swept around a bend and the next
instant the fireman had dropped his
flash and was fighting the current
madly a single illuminating glance
had given him the solution of lost
rivers mystery

  in the white blaze of the torch
loomed a jagged knife-edge of rock
flinging up from the waters surface to
the shadows of the cave roof upon
this knife-edge the river split on the
right arose the thunder and the gray
smoke of the falls to the left of the
barrier the dark water hurried
smoothlyon lost river abruptly be-
came two rivers

  there was a grinding crash the
boat hurled against the jagged stone
by the force of the current broke up

  dick gasped in the icy grip of the
water the thunder of the falls was in
his ears its spray beat against his face
then the thunder was dying and he
was being hurried onward smoothly
and relentlessly the fireman had been
thrown to the left instead of to the
right-death had passed him by inches

  he quickly realized that the current
of the divided stream was much less
swift than that of the main river

instinctively he swam to the
left he was not far from the cave
wall when a pinpoint of light appeared
in the distance the pinpoint grew in
size and was joined by others dick
raised his head cautiously and swore in
exultant amazement

  the pinpoints had resolved into
several lanterns strung on wires and
beneath their flickering glow a number
of dark objects loomed

  two of these objects were big gaso-
line launches firmly moored and rising
and falling gently to the lap of the cur-
rent but it was not the launches that
riveted the firemans attention

  the cave had widened greatly the
river occupying but a comparatively
small portion of it upon the left was
a sandy beach extending into the shad-
ows several rude shacks huddled to-
gether and near them was a short
stretch of  railroad  upon which
rested several cars dick farnol pull-
ing his shivering body onto the shad-
owy upper end of the beach stared
with unbelieving eyes

   the camp cars and those two cars
of dynamite sure as youre a foot
high  he marvelled  and theres the
engine

  the engine was there all right si-
lent and ghostly but not with the cars
it rested upon rails firmly spiked to the
deck of a big scow on either side of
lost river



which were moored the launches on
the scows deck dick could also make
out a heap of rails and track-laying
materials

   no wonder they had us guessing
he reasoned to himself  everybody
thought the cave was impassable be-
cause of the falls but these jiggers
somehow got the lowdown on how the
river acted chances are this has been
a bandit hangout for years of course
the c  p railroad would spoil things
for them sooner or later el cascabel
or somebody in his outfit has brains and
figured out a scheme to give the road
hell

   that scow is just like a railroad
ferryboat plenty big and strong
enough to handle a couple of cars or a
light construction engine swinging
the rails out laying a few lengths to
the waters edge and easing her down
onto the scow from the siding wasnt
piuch of a trick either and of course
those big launches could haul the scow
back and forth without any trouble
those first two cars of dynamite just
about rolled down the grade he sur-
mised  now where do we go

  the string of cars cast deep shad-
ows the tall fireman crept along in
this shadow until he was near one of
the shacks he paused peering into
the darkness

  this building like the others ap-
peared silent and deserted but dick
felt sure one or all of them housed oc-
cupants

   whole gangs asleep about this
time he decided  its up to me to
find cover before they wake up

with this end in view the rail-
road man crept closer to the
shack cracks in the rough board wall
intrigued him and he tried to peer
through one he could see nothing but

soon became aware of low moans with-
in the building

   whats the matter in there hom-
bre he called out softly

  silence ensued followed by shuffling
sounds

   senor who are you a voice whis-
pered shrilly

  dick was sure of his ground now
 im from the railroad who are you
fellows

  the answer came back  senor we
are starving we have had but a
mouthful of bread since these bandidos
accursed brought us here as prisoners
 i knew it dick exulted  i knew
it was the section men then to the
prisoners  how can i get you out 
there was a low murmur of voices
the man who acted as spokesman
hissed directions

   the door it is locked in that
small hut beside the big boat on which
the loco stands is a sentry it is his
duty to watch the river lest a chance
boat approach he has the key to the
door

   lucky for me my boat busted up
dick congratulated himself  id a
butted right into a dose of lead poison-
ing

 a word of warning came from
within the shack  senor the sentry
is armed and he does not sleep also
there are many others in the big cabins
below here

   thanks for the tip dick replied
 now you boys keep quiet until i come
back

  silently he faded into the shadows
beside the cars there was a lighted
space to be crossed before he could at-
tain the hut in question but dick felt
sure the sentry would have his eyes on
the river giving little attention to the
shore behind him from which no dan-
ger was expected


railroad stories

  nevertheless crossing that lighted
space was a risky business the fireman
hesitated an instant peering at the
squat little building with its single
door then taking a deep breath he
dashed forward swiftly and silently

   the door yielded to his hand letting
him into the dimly lighted hut

   a stockily built mexican seated on a
stool beside the window leaped to his
feet at the intrusion gun coming from
its holster

  one of dicks iron hands clamped
the sentrys wrist numbing his fingers
until they were useless the other
closed upon his throat gasping kick-
ing the mexican was lifted clear of the
floor and held against the wall for a
few seconds he struggled weakly then
went limp as the american dropped
him to the floor

  dick slipped the mexicans gun into
his own waistband went through his
pockets and drew forth -a large key
with a final glance at the prostrate
man he left the hut

   guess hell keep for a spell the
fireman muttered as he hastened to
open the prisoners shack a ponderous
bolt creaked rustily and slid back dick
gave the door a shove

   easy now he told the section
hands who crowded toward him
 make no noise how can we get
away from here

then well go down

after a moment of silence a fat
-peon spoke  there is a boat a
big one lying below the last cabin it
is nearly as large as that on which the

engine rests we can steal that senor
but we cannot paddle it upstream

   then well go down

   but senor this river accursed-
none knows where it goes it may
never see the light of day

  the firemans harsh words bit
through the mexicans indecision

   cant help that one things sure
-if we stay here none of us will ever
again see the light of day-or any
other kind of light weve got to go
somewhere

  there was a jabber of low voices
and the fat fellow spoke again

   it is agreed senor we go where
you lead

  dick stepped through the door
 come on then he whispered  and
quiet if they hear us in those cabins
were sunk

  like wraiths the three score mep
slipped along in the shadows the big
railroader leading they passed the
sleeping cabins safely reached the boat
a roomy scow and boarded her dick
fumbled with the mooring chain curs-
ing the twists and cumbersome knots

  a wild yell shattered the silence
then another and another dick
yanked at the chain and swore in exas-
peration

  now the sentrys yells were aug-
mented by others from the aroused
cabins a door banged open words
in spanish and english whirled and
pattered

  dick jerked the last length of
chain loose and strained against the
scows side the muscles of his arms
and back standing out like ropes

    help shove her off he ordered the
mexicans

  a dozen sprang ashore brawny
shoulders heaved the scow moved
sluggishly swung sideways as the cur-
rent caught her a final concerted ef-
lost river



fort and she had straightened out
dick and the others scramhled aboard

   down low the fireman shouted

  the warning came not an instant too
soon flame spurted from the shore
the cavern echoed to the roar of gun-
fire  bullets thudded against the scows
sides or knocked splinters from the
rail a peon cried out shrilly as a slug
seared his flesh cursed the gun wielder
upon finding the wound to be but
slight

  caught in the full grip of the cur-
rent the scow darted downstream in
the darkness and was lost to view of
the men on shore the rifle fire ceased
but just as the glow of the lanterns
winked out dick caught the sound of a
derisive laugh his keen eyes stared
back toward the bandits camp that
laugh was more disturbing than a con-
tinuation of rifle fire would have been

on raced the scow propelled by a
current which dick estimated at
least ten miles an hour at first the
fireman was at a loss to account for the
suddenly accelerated power but he
finally reasoned that the splitting of the
stream at the falls and the wide beach
encountered so soon after made for a
backwash which retarded the upper
river

   were sure going somewhere all
right he said to the fat mexican
whose name was felipe

   si senor replied felipe  but
where

  dick shook his head his lean jaw
tightened a bit when he spoke his
words did not deal with the scows pos-
sible destination

   any idea who it was gave us that
hoss laugh as we pulled out felipe
even as he spoke dick sensed the
mexicans grimace of distaste

   that was bl cascabel himself

seiior came the reply  or i am mis-
taken much he laughed that way the
night we were brought to the cavern
and one of our brave fellows attempted
to escape that devil knew my friend
was running into the arms of his men

   hmm doesnt sound so good
say tell me something about bl cas-
cabel

  in the minutes that followed dick
learned much concerning the rattle-
snake how the man had been a leader
of the bl infierno verde bandits for
years increasing his power by succeed-
ing acts of ruthlessness defying the
feeble attempts of the government to
subdue him becoming at length a name
of terror spoken only in whispers

  no wonder he scared poor little
pablo the engine watchman com-
mented the tall fireman  guess bl
cascabel must have turned him loose
with a warning and told him to pass the
word along

  felipe agreed  it is bl cascabels
way

  dicks next remark was grim and to
the point  well that gent is gonna
find out hes dealing with railroaders
now and they dont scare easy time
we get through with that gang theyll
all be locked up or else there wont be
anything but spanish spoken in hell for
a week

  hours passed and still the boat raced
on felipe and chosen men of his fol-
lowing stood by the rails with planks
ripped from the inner sheathing ready
to fend the unwieldy craft from the
side walls of the cavern against which
it ground from time to time the
stream seemed singularly free from
rocks for which all were devoutly
thankful

  against the bow rail crouched dick
farnol tirelessly peering into the dark-
ness ahead straining his gray eyes for


railroad stories

the first glimpse of light that would
herald the end of the gloomy and seem-
ingly endless tunnel

  strange fears swam about in the
firemans mind an active imagination
stimulated by the eerie environment
peopled the black vault with unknown
terrors the beat of an occasional
wave might be the low thunder of dis-
tant falling stones which would block
the passage and doom the occupants of
the scow to a terrible death in the
gloomy cave el cascabels sardonic
laugh still ringing in his ears hinted at
unimaginable horrors

suddenly dick started like a
person on the verge of sleep he
wiped his forehead which had become
moist despite the bitter chill from the
icy water

   steady he spoke as much to
himself as to the mexicans who were
murmuring together in a huddled
group  steady he repeated  i got
a notion were close to daylight every-
body on their toes now we may be
heading right into a red block

  his words had the desired effect
the section men were aroused by the
hint of new danger at the end of the
passage then eelipe exclaimed 

   senor the dark grows less

  dick had already noticed it-a vague
grayness that sifted through the black
wall like water through sand he gave
crisp orders

   ease her over toward the left you
fellows with the planks we dont
want to go hammering outa here under
a full head of steam until we know if
the switches are lined up

  at that the section foreman moved
forward and said  senor there is a
narrow beach here beside the wall
shall we ground the boat

   si dick agreed  and dont make

a sound felipe theres where she
opens out and doesnt that look like a
shack against the left wall

  the mexican shaded his eyes peer-
ing toward the misty gray oval that had
appeared as the scow drifted around a
final bend

   si senor smoke is arising

   dicks lean bronzed face lighted with
satisfaction  thats why el casca-
bel laughed he told felipe  hes got
guards stationed down here and figures
wed highball right into them steady
you fellows beach her right here and
then follow me oh what a grand sur-
prise those jiggersll get

  silently the fireman stole over the
wet sands hugging the wall and its
shadow he was followed by the
gaunt half-starved section men their
hollow eyes red with the light of
vengeance

  the ramshackle cabin built on piles
driven into the sandy beach was
reached the stealthy waves of fam-
ished men flowed around it a door
crashed open

  three men seated at a table yelled
wildly and reached for nearby rifles
but before their hands could close on
weapons they were engulfed by those
famished waves no longer stealthy

  by main strength dick and felipe
and one or two other of the cooler
heads pulled the frenzied mexicans
from their victims who were then
bound and laid on bunks built against
the walls

a store of food was found and
quickly apportioned while the
section workers were relieving their
hunger dick reconnoitered about the
cave mouth

  he found that this half of lost
river flowed into another and larger
stream the entrance almost hidden
lost river



by bushes and trailing vines was
blocked by a heavy chain across it at
water level a boat attempting to leave
or enter the cave would be effectually
held with its occupants at the mercy of
the guards rifles el cascabel appar-
ently took no chances

  the chain was soon loosed the three
prisoners were loaded into the scow
and the big boat shoved through the
opening

   now where are we dick won-
dered

  one of the mexicans spoke up  i
know senor this is rio plata silver
river we are but a few miles below
arturo it is on the right bank we
should land senor

  at arturo the fireman turned his
prisoners over to the lieutenant of rail-
road police stationed there then
while the section men headed for cook
cars and food dick went to the flying
field

   you fellows stay right here and
dont let anybody tell you different
he told felipe  i may want you later
at the aviation quarters jaggers
dunns order procured a plane for dick
farnol he took off and boomed north
smiling grimly he gazed down upon
the jumbled wilderness of el infierno
verde visualizing the long freights and
the thundering yellow passenger trains
of the c  p

   so we cant build a railroad across
there eh he said to himself  well
see about that

  landing at ibarra dick hurried to
the trainmasters office in search of
jaggers dunn

   mr dunn is at camp six said
the operator in the outer office  shall

i	try and get him for you

  the man was reaching for his key
when the sounder began to chatter
the op listened intently all at once

the color drained from his face and he
leaped to his feet with an outcry

   whats wrong dick demanded
seizing him by the arm

   dynamite howled the operator
two cars of dynamite loose-and
runnin down lost river hill itll
blow this town off the map wheres
hallihan wheres farley

  the op dashed from his office shout-
ing instantly confusion reigned in the
yards orders were bawled and coun-
termanded frenzied officials dashed
about madly persons not connected
with the railroad immediately ran
away

  dick left the office growling el
cascabel again towed those cars of
dynamite up the river shoved them on-
to the siding and turned these loose on
the main line-the murdering sidewind-
er now if this doesnt beat hell

  people were pouring from houses
near the yards fleeing toward the hills
in frantic haste but dick knew that
many would not have time to escape

  and theres the hospital too he
remembered  dozens in there lots of
them railroaders

he ran toward the yards main
lead a daring plan in his mind
on the lead stood an engine steam up
but deserted

   crew eating lunch he said then
raised his voice  hey you wait a
minute

  the hail was directed to a switch-
man going by at a run dick seized the
excited man by the shoulder and halted
him peremptorily

   get on that footboard he or-
dered gesturing toward the engine
 line the main line switch for me

  one look at the firemans hard eyes
and the switchman obeyed mounting
the cab steps dick cracked the throttle


railroad stories

the big engine clanked up the lead
paused at the switch and then moved
out onto the main line

   thanks dick called to the
switchman as he widened on the
throttle

up the grade boomed the big loco-
motive her stack chuckling her
siderods clanking a wild song she
reeled wildly on the curves for she was
backing up at a speed at which no tank
was ever intended to buck a bent rail
she clattered over the switches of the
trestle siding deserted now and dick
glanced back at the great web of stone
and steel over which he had just passed

   turn em into that siding and
theyd blow the new trestle to hell and
delay the road a year he reasoned
apropos of the dynamite cars he was
racing to meet

  at each straight stretch he strained
his eyes for a glimpse of the runaways
shaking his head dubiously  if i meet
them babies on a curve-

 where the right-of-way swept
around the mountainside in a great
shallow bend he closed the throttle and
let her drift listening intently on
went the brakes and over went the re-
verse bar

   its them

  his ears had caught the echo of a
distant rumble the runaways were
somewhere on the curve

  dick cracked the throttle and headed
back down the mountain he was but
a few hundred yards from the curve
when the runaways rounded it

  sheets of flame were flaring out
from the burning journal boxes the
wheels were screeching a protest and
the cars were rocking crazily for an
instant dick felt sure they were going
to leave the rail but with a clanging
lurch they took the straight-away and

hurtled toward the engine dick jerked
her wide open spun the sand blowers
and hitched the bar up notch by
notch

  the engine was flying but the run-
aways steadily gained dick tugged at
the throttle set the bar a notch off
center and glanced back at the death
bearing down upon him

   just like were standing still he
breathed between clenched teeth  and
were likely to leave the track at the
next curve

  the flaming cars continued to gain
but not so swiftly dick glanced back
again saw the red loom directly back
of the tender and braced his feet

  crash despite the speed the engine
had attained the impact was terrific
hurling the locomotive forward on
screeching wheels dick tensed his
palms sweating then he grinned a
trifle sheepishly as he began easing foe
throttle shut and working the brake

  soon he had the runaways under
control he brought them to a stop and
dashed water into the blazing journal
boxes the wooden sills and the floor
planking of the cars were charred and
smoldering but a few buckets of water
cooled them down

  dick pulled the complaining cars into
a demoralized and practically deserted
yard and renewed his call for jaggers
dunn

  keep the boats to the left he di-
rected the general manager as
they planned the raid on bl cascabels
cave  then theyll be safe tell your
men to hit the beach in a hurry and
dont hesitate to shoot if necessary its
a bad bunch all right but you can han-
dle them

   and you questioned mr dunn
 are going along to direct things

   nope the tall fireman responded
lost river



 im flying to arturo right now ive
got a hunch and im playing it

  the g m started to protest then
closed his lips  all right he agreed
 have it your own way well be in
that cave before daylight

  that closed the conference and both
men leaped into action

  dick landed at arturo got felipe
and the rescued section men together
and headed for the office of the lieuten-
ant of railroad police

   i want guns for these men he
told the officer who knew him well

   say fella who do you think you
are returned the policeman if
theres any police work to be done on
this road me and my menll do it

   listen came the answer in a low
even voice  ive got a real job of rail-
roading to do and i need those guns
the breathless lieutenant glared at
the cold gray eyes a moment and
growled acquiescence

  all right all right but if any-
thing goes wrong youre responsible
 i will be brother

  later hurrying toward rio plata at
the head of his men dick chuckled
soundlessly

  if id showed him jaggers order
id have got anything in the office with-
out argument but shucks i plumb for-
got all about it

outside the almost hidden cav-
ern mouth rio plata gleamed
whitely in the moonlight an occasion-
al night birds call drifted weirdly
down from among the crags the
swiftly flowing water moaned and mut-
tered chafing against the iron barriers
of granite that hemmed it in other-
wise there was silence

  within the caverns mouth the si-
lence was complete broken only by the
soft lapping of lost river on its nar-

row beach darkness was unpierced by
any straggling moonbeam the rude
cabin seemed deserted across the
rivers mouth stretched the heavy
chain

  gradually the silence was broken by
a whisper it grew stealthily along the
rocky walls and roof magnifying and
multiplying itself nearer it sepa-
rated from the confusing echoes and
became the steady putt-putt of a gas
engine but the lone cabin remained as
silent as before

  around the bend swept two big gaso-
line launches jammed with men who
loomed dimly in the light of lanterns
the launches ran alongside the beach
a voice shouted hoarsely

  as if the shout had flipped a switch
the cavern blazed with light powerful
electric torches poured their floods of
radiance upon the boats throwing the
men there into vivid relief against the
blackness beyond other torches played
their beams across leveled rifles in the
hands of men grouped about the cabin

  caught utterly unprepared the
figures in the launches could only stare
resistance would be suicide instinc-
tively their hands went up

  dick farnol stepped forward  had
a notion youd be coming along this
way he drawled  figured youd try
to sneak out through the back door
when you learned a raiding party was
coming down the river all right
amigos step ashore and be blamed
careful how you do it those hombres
behind the guns are the ones you tried
to starve to death they sure got itchy
trigger fingers

  he turned to a big man in the bow
of the first boat-a hook-ngsed devil
with a slabbing mouth and a white scar
beside his left eye

   fellow your rattling days are
over no dont reach for that gun it 


railroad stories

aint healthy the gray eyes were
cold and ruthless now  guess i made
a mistake bout them tied-down hol-
sters looks like youre gonna live
quite a while-safe behind bars

  el cascabel glowered evilly at the
fireman in a flash his gun came out
a lean bony finger on the trigger a
spurt of flame cut the air-but the bul-
let flew wild el cascabel was a split-
second too late

  the former cowboy from arizona
had again justified his reputation as a
quick-draw man that remark about
tied-down holsters was right after all

jaggers dunn chuckled loudly
as dick told his story under the
mellow lights of the g ms private car
as the dusky porter moved slowly in
and out with cooling drinks

   you sure played it right son said
the official  im mighty proud of you
and by the way the superintendent of
the flying field is anxious to get you
signed up guess youre entitled to
most any job youd like to have

  dick shook his head  nope guess
ill stick to railroading thats real
he-man work

  jaggers chuckled again  youll be
taken care of he promised now
youd better get a little rest

  he watched the tall figure swing
across the tracks of the busy yard
then his gaze wandered to the wink-
ing red and green lights the snorting
engines and the rumbling cars and
finally back to the big fireman he
nodded sagely to the old porter

odd facts about new york subways

many curious and interesting facts could be told about new york citys subway-
elevated network the i r t and b-m t lines from the atburtis ave station
to the flushing station constitute a masterpiece in construction enginering for years
the builders battled with quicksand and marshes to lay a causeway across the swamp

    on the b-m t canarsie line just outside the e th st station is the only
grade crossing on any subway-elevated line in new york it is also one of the few
places where the subway runs at street level on an embankment and has a right-of-
way similar to a railroad

    the canarsie line also offers two more unusual things the first is that amazing
network of tracks at the atlantic ave station and just north of it this is always a
source of wonder to anyone viewing it for the first time the only rival to this laby-
rinth is the junction of the b-m t and i r t at queensboro plaza on the flushing-
astoria lines

    the other wonder on the canarsie line is at the wilson ave station here sand-
wiched between st johns cemetery and the long island railroads right-of-way the
eastbound track is placed over the westbound not content with just constructing
tracks through this narrow spot the b-m t defied tradition and put a station in
there-wilson ave the eastbound track is above street level and the westbound is
underground although above street level this spot is remarkable because it is prob-
ably the only place where from a point above street level a train travels uphill to
enter a tunnel below street level

    a condition similar to this is found on the i r t woodlawn line near mosholu
parkway here flanked on the west by a railroad yard approximately  feet below
the level of the track a retaining wall on the east stretches nearly  feet up to street
level these yards are also on street level which places a train in the peculiar posi-
tion of being on an elevated structure below street level

    another sight which is very seldom seen elsewhere is on the broadway brooklyn
line b-m t operating from broad street to eastern parkway broadway jet
there they run six-car locals and three car expresses-brooklyn railroad club

reminiscences comments and criticism
from all over the world

he natural formations mentioned in
my  lost river  story are not un-
common there are  lost rivers 
in many parts of the world arizona
has one and there are  or  in
western florida in mammoth cave
ky the river styx flows  ft
beneath the earths surface between banks  ft
apart a volume of water  ft deep it rolls on
for about a quarter-mile and disappears in a bank
of fine sand veiled in both its coming and its
going mysterious as life itself

  the river lys on entering belgium dashes
abruptly over a precipice and is lost to view for
nearly half a mile in france the meuse follows
a subterranean course for  miles the river
drome in normandy on nearing the sea plunges
into a hole known as the pit of soucy from
which it never reappears except in the form of
new springs which are presumed to arise from its
hidden waters another lost river is the brama-
putra of india

  in my own virginia mountain country are a
number of similar cases sinking creek disap-
pears and reappears more than a dozen times in
its course plunging abruptly into chasms or sink-
ing into sandy or marshy ground at times it
pours from beneath some cliff then again it will
rise silently from sand or marshland finally it
vanishes for good and all nobody knows where
the devil it goes vast caves and passages such
as i mentioned are not uncommon in such rivers

the western union kid

  i got the idea for  the western union kid 
from my own early experiences and from a clip-
ping in my scrapbook about an old friend miss
zephreine carter-god rest her soul miss carter
worked one wire at athol mass for  years
and was an op for  years i never went back
to athol where i once worked without drop-
ping in to see her

  i wrote many stories around the western union
when the old  main  was at  state st
boston well do i remember trudging in and
out of the doane st entrance myself with the
number  on my a d t cap years ago
when some of my telegrapher stories first showed
up in railroad mans magazine it was safer
for me to send a scout upstairs to see if the
coast was clear for some of those old boys
thought i was drawing their pictures a little too

bygone days

  drop of  feet into the delaware river engi-
  neer dave wood and fireman charles frazer saw
  that a huge rock pile had fallen blocking the
  right-of-way dave wanted to stay at his throt-
  tle but charlie grabbed him and jumped thgjr
  engine hit the rock and plunged out of sight into
  deep water dragging the jimmies along

    a wrecker worked for months on sundays drag-
  ging the engine up to a spot where the water was
  low enough to put a track under her and haul
  her back on the main line finally she was re-
  conditioned and for years was used for switching
  in the jersey city yards when i left the erie in

  us in colorado on wednesday the th while
  heading for cripple creek via the florence 
  cripple creek ry now part of the midland
  terminal ry we passed a freight train on a
  siding next day we heard talk at the hotel
  about the terrible wreck of that freight it seems
  her air had frozen while she was sidetracked for
  our train and when she started down the main
  line there was nothing to hold her but the loco-
  motive and hand brakes the  drag  left the
  rails plunging down into a steep gorge killing
  every man in the engine and train crews except
  the rear brakeman the lone survivor testified
  that he had dropped off the train to throw the
  switch but that she picked up speed so rapidly
  he couldnt board the caboose as it passed

    our show was billed in florence for saturday

mileage hogs

  this is a true sketch of
the greedy side of railroad
labor i am writing it in
a baggage room on the far
end of a local freight run
in california nothing
here but the depot the
caboose and  bootleg-
gers we have to lay over
for  hours  miles
from home while another
crew makes a round trip
of  days

 but im not making
this kick on my own be-
half i have been employed continuously for 
years on this class  short-line railroad including
 years as tallowpot and  as hoghead and am
now back firing have belonged to organized
labor all my life and am working  days a week
our pike extends northwesterly  miles from
the san francisco bay region it passes through
as prosperous and scenic a country as will be
found anywhere in u s a through the largest
poultry center in the world-the worlds egg
basket where  million dozen eggs are produced
annually through a country world-famous for
its apples pears prunes and other fruits

  but despite all these things many of the men

   	r

working here would like to have the world with
a barbed wire fence around it for their very own
conditions have arisen among the railroad work-
ers that do not exist in other industries rules
and schedules allow one set of men to make all
of the money while the other fellow gets kicked
out the older man in seniority naturally wants
to make it all claiming his seniority entitles him
to it he does not realize that his seniority
entitles him only to the best job not to almost
unlimited mileage

  i	am employed on one of the  divisions that
comprise this little railroad this division is 
miles in length it is a rich revenue producer
the next division is in the redwood timber coun-
try from which much of the redwood used
throughout the country comes from the outlet
to the eastern markets is to deliver the cars to
this division on which they are hauled over a
mountain and then  miles more to a con-
nection with a transcontinental railroad

  this other division comprises  miles of main
track and some short branches to the logging
mills and woods at present about  engineers
and  firemen are working there regular as
against  to  full crews a few years
back all of the train service organizations on
that division have reduced their number of work-
ing days per month so as to give their brothers


railroad stories

a pair of mountain lions were kept in the union pacific station at green river wyo 
years ago to amuse travelers on their -minute layover for refreshments

a chance to live but not so the brothers on this
division at least not the hoggers

  organized labor throughout the country has
adopted a  spread the work  program and most
classes are satisfied with  days per month and
many with  days per month a great many
are glad to take what they can get the hoggers
on our road consented to a  months trial period
of reduction in mileage in freight service they re-
duced their allotment from  miles  days
to  miles  days in passenger service they
cut it from  miles  days to  miles
 days previous to last may all other train
service employees on this railroad except the
hoggers reduced their mileage or number of days
worked per month in all classes of service from

	to  days per month firemen in passenger
service were allowed  to  miles per
month those in freight service  and those
in yard service  the hoggers fell in line
last june adopting practically the same mileage
regulations-on trial

  but now in winter with business in this lo-
cality at a standstill the hoggers on this pike
are seeking to boost their number of days worked
per month instead of reducing them they want
to be allowed to work the equivalent of  days
in freight service or  in passenger service before
being required to lay off this would add from
 to s-o per month to their earnings

  it surely does not seem possible in times like
these that any group of fairly paid not well
paid workers should be so selfish it seems odd
that any group should insist on working the
equivalent of  to  days per month this
in spite of the fact that there are great numbers

of their brothers with  to  years of servpe
walking the streets looking for jobs

  on this division  engineers are working reg-
ularly and only  or  kept on the extra board
the firemen have but  men on regular jobs
the difference being caused by the use of electric
motor cars and gas-electric rail cars yet the
firemens extra board supports from  to  men
in winter months due to the relief work afforded
by the regular men being required to lay off when
they have made their maximum miles

  among the  engineers working regularly at
least  are moderately rich owning between
 and  apiece twelve others are
landlords owning in whole or part large apart-
ment houses another dozen are comfortably
fixed due to wise investments of one kind or
another the whole  seem to be enjoying the
material things of life in large measure yet almost
to a man they persist in working every day in
the month and thus take the bread out of the
mouths of men who are not permitted to work
at all some are making  days a month in
freight service equivalent to 

  the firemen earn but  per  miles while
the engineer gets  this since we have had
our wages cut  per cent

  if all the railroads of u s were put under
the n r a and if hours of service were limited
by code or law it would be a blessing to railroad
workers in general thousands would be put
back on the payrolls i have taken up this mat-
ter with mr eastman the federal coordinator
of transportation and he said in reply that my
correspondence would be made a matter of record
in seeking future railroad legislation-california

atlantic type engines march issue
reminds me that the canadian pa-
cific used a -- engine on locals
between toronto and havelock
some time between  and 
i often saw her at peterborough
station at that time she had an electric head-
light-the spluttering arc variety-and was not
vaudain compound but -cylinder simple with
piston valves in chambers rolled in toward the
saddle and driven by inside rockers but was
otherwise as described she could run like a deer

  someone told me the c p rebuilt their atlan-
tics into -- passenger engines but if this is
true perhaps mr brown means they were
scrapped after that evidently the coming of the
steel passenger car sounded the death knell of
this graceful type of engine-h s gowan

origin of the split switch

  would like to find out the earliest record of the
so-called split switch which has been in common
use in america for  to  years my father
a g eastman was mechanical supt  to
 on the southeastern ry now part of the
canadian pacific when headquarters was being
moved from richford vt to famham que the
railroad company needed a large quantity of
granite so they acquired right to a quarry at the
top of st pie mountain

  this is located near the track on the st guil-
laume branch about  miles from famham a
spur was built to the foot of the mountain and
then a railroad was put up the side of the moun-
tain with an even grade to the quarry at the top
the motive power was created by the loaded car
descending this pulled up the empty car by a
steel cable which wound several times around two
steel drums at the top of the line these drums
had a band brake on either end of each drum
operated by a regular brake head	

  at a point midway up the mountain there was
a passing track where the car going up would
pass the one coming down each end of this
track was equipped with the old stub switch a
switchman was placed there to line them up as
needed one day the switchman failed and there
was a collision

  thereupon my father figured out how to make
a self-operating switch it was exactly as our
present split switch except that the old style lever
throw switch stand was used and instead of the
usual target at the top a large iron ball was
welded on so that when the car ran through it
would force the weighted lever over and the
weight would hold it snug to the rail

  that was in  two or  years later when
my father returned from a master mechanics
convention he told me a man had a similar switch
on exhibition there but the general opinion of
those present was that although it could be used
in the south it would be useless in places where
there was snow in winter will anyone knowing
of a prior use of this type of switch please give
me the facts-a c eastman b  m engi-

      whistle him down shouted the traveling en-
 gineer too late the jab into the tail end
 knocked their cars into our train and then there
 were  trains in a wreck the pull was like the
 feel of a catfish caught on a fishermans line

 and i were waiting for a delayed northbound
 local freight upon its arrival the hoghead said
 to us if you fellows want some fresh meat go
 down to bridge - and help yourselves i
 struck an animal there after the train pulled
 out we got buckets knives and a hatchet then
 hiked over to the bridge  miles away after
 a long search for the carcass of beef or whatever
 it was we found nothing but a dead jackrabbit
 vou can bet we cussed that hoggers idea of a
 practical joke-thomas fowler kingsville tex

trains planes and busses

   on jan   a westbound twa pas-
 senger plane was forced down at st james mo
 due to a heavy coating of ice on the wings the

 	passengers were then placed on a bus headed
 for springfield but the bus driver said it was
 impossible to drive with an inch of ice on the
 road finally the stranded travelers were put on
 a frisco train which took them safely on their
 way the old iron mare aint so bad after all

  japanese umbrella palm conservatory plant

 easily grown from seed winter or summer

  the japanese umbrella palm is a semi-aquatic plant

  it  easily grown from seed either in a bowl of water or
  in very damp soil probably the most usual as well aa
  the most interesting method is to cultivate the plant in
  a bowl or jardiniere filled with water wth two or three
  inches of good garden soil at the bottom the seeds
  soon commence to germinate and the plant shoots up
  stems two to three feet high and rapidly assumes a most
  pretty palm-like appearance as shown in the engraving

  the tops of the stems are surmounted by a whorl of um-
  brella-shaped leaves of a waxy appearance we will
