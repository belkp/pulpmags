   i am glad to tell you i sold an arti-

nla training as the best preparation
for writing in fields other than news-

how do you know
   you cant write

  have you ever tried

  have you ever attempted eventbe least bit of train-
ing under competent guidance	

   or have you been sitting back as it is so easy to do
waiting for the day to come some time when you will
awaken all of a sudden to the discovery i am a
writer 

   if the latter course is the one of your choosing you
probably never will write lawyers must be law clerks
doctors must be internes engineers must be drafts-
men we all know that in our times the egg does come
before the chicken

  it is seldom that any one becomes a writer until he
or she has been writing for some time that is why
so many authors and writers spring up out of the news-
paper business the day-to-day necessity of writing-of
gathering material about which to write-develops their
talent their background and their confidence as nothing
else could

  that is why the newspaper institute of america bases
its writing instruction on journalism-continuous writing
-the training that has produced so many successful
authors

learn to write by writing

njewspaper institute training is based on the new york
a  copy-desk method it starts and keeps you writing in your
own home on your own time week by week you receive actual
assignments just as if you were right at work on a great metro-
politan daily your writing is individually corrected and con-
structively criticized a group of men whose combined newspaper
experience totals more than  years are responsible for this
instruction under such sympathetic guidance you will find that
instead of vainly trying to copy some one elses writing tricks
you are rapidly developing your own distinctive self-flavored style
-undergoing an experience that has a thrill to it and which at the
same time develops in you the power to make your feelings articulate

   many people who should be writing become awestruck by fabu-
lous stories about millionaire authors and therefore give little
thought to the   and  or more that can often be
earned for material that takes little time to write-stories ar-
ticles on business fads travels sports recipes etc-things that
can easily be turned out in leisure hours and often on the im-
pulse of the moment

a chance to test yourself

   we have prepared a unique writing aptitude test this tells
you whether you possesss the fundamental qualities necessary to
successful writing-acute observation dramatic instinct creative
imagination etc youll enjoy taking this test the coupon will

bill brendan was head fire-
man-diver on fireboat two
i but a man being what his back-
ground makes him brendan was
more than this

   everybody in the los angeles harbor
 district knew gunboat brendan the for-
 mer navy boxer seaman gunner and so

 forth the navy knew him for his

 work on sunken submarines the fireboat
 crew knew him for what he was and
 mother brendan knew him for what she
 thought he was all this was behind his
 shoulder now as he sat hulking over his
 pipe listening to the police broadcast

 my gosh boys taylor the pilot
 whistled softly twenty thousand in

 currency and the mugs get away with it
 three of em burned down by the cops
 the other two steal a parked patrol
 car-

   he fell silent listening the engineer
 broke out excitedly

  hear that headed for the harbor
district reported by an officer at main
and weford emptied his gun into the
car as it went past but it kept on
brendan nodded soberly cocking an
eye at the window of the pier office

   aint so good heavy fog-bank roll-
ing up out o the west basin tonight he
observed good night for some drunk
to hit suicide curve too

  the police broadcast ended there
was brisk discussion of that stolen police
car bearing two thugs and a small for-

t reboa t men must
jt be not only firemen
but sailors divers engi-
neers and police-danger-
ous callings all    this
first poignant story of a
colorful series centers
about gunboat brendan
and the tragic problem
he met below the murky
harbor waters

hop to it you lard os
shouted captain law-
rence get those chests
over move around

thats right said taylor solemnly
	-about time for another one eleven

tune headed now for the harbor here yeart i been here weve fished out six-
at its berth however fireboat two was ty-four cars harbor commissions been
in no position to see any possible fun eleven year waiting to put up stop warn-
suicide curve eh	ines at those open dead-end streets be-


tween the piers people heading for the
ferry terminal in a fog like this had bet-
ter not be in a rush

  remember the family we fished out
last winter growled brendan that
guy was just plain lost riles me up
whenever i think o them little tykes
drowned on account of the harbor com-
mission saving money id like to be a
politician for about ten days

  youd make a hot one all right
jeered the engineer you and your-
holy mackerel listen to that talk of
the devil and up he comes

  the alarm was shrilling one and all
were in motion instantly a car off the
foot of berth  came the shout a
watchman had heard it go off but knew
no details his alarm had been relayed
from headquarters

  already fireboat two was like a
swarming beehive twenty firemen were
loading equipment on the boats stern
working with precise rapidity every
instant counted for there was always
the chance of pulling somebody up alive
not much hope of it tonight however
this blanketing fog would keep them
from getting there in time

  hop to it you lardos  shouted cap-
tain lawrence get those chests over
mike and johnny over with the diving
ladder the pump-lower away there 
seventy-one seconds after the alarm
shrilled they had the equipment stowed
on the wide flat stern

  captain lawrence shot his orders at
duke dumas the master-diver

  duke get howard dressed for the
first dive slap a suit on brendan for a
stand-by as usual move you sleep-
walkers  this is no pleasure cruise-

the captain ran forward to where
taylor hung out of the wheel-house
whistle-cord in hand all three annunci-
ators on stand-by his voice roared
all right all right men lets roll
berth  give her the gun-a cars
down come on whats holding us

  pilot taylor tooted the cast-off signal
these skippers were all alike he grum-
bled audibly thought a pilot could go
speeding upchannel in a pea-soup fog at
twenty-five knots like the rescue wagon
from headquarters they never seemed
to realize that the fireboat master had to
feel his way against harbor traffic sound-
ing his signals according to navigation
law and regulating his speed by the same

  the pilot cant help it he growled
if this makes it impossible to get folks



up from cars in time cars got no busi-
ness going overboard anyhow he turned
to the engine-room tube as the boat go-
ing slow speed ahead on three engines
emerged from the slip five hundred
revs a minute chief dead slow all en-
gines keep your crew set for four bells
and a jingle astern

  he snapped the speaking-tube shut
and took position in the center of the
darkened wheel-house while the captain
cursed softly steer  degrees he
instructed the first mate nothing to
the westard

  aye said the mate a lean state of
maine mariner three fifty-five and
nothing to the westard peering into
the binnacle he rolled the wheel to port
and starboard and settled on his course

fireboat two headed up the channel
her air-horn tooted at minute inter-
vals while the watch up forward strained
every sense into the woolly wall of fog
that hemmed them in a voice sounded
abruptly

  beacon eight dead ahead skipper
hear the foghorn on  port bow
aye said taylor and changed course
at once fireboat two cautiously nosejj
into slip five and in another minute
was alongside berth 

  one more minute and apprentice-diver
howard in stiff rubber and canvas dress
his domed helmet hundred-pound waist
weights and thirty-pound leaded shoes
was on his way into the pitch-black
depths below forty feet of water here
an ambulance and a gathering crowd
showed on the pier dimly so dense was
the fog that even the rescue wagons
red light was no more than a dim blur

  duke dumas the master diver in
charge leaned over the guard-rail hold-
ing the air hose and life-lines four men
aft at the pump were turning it over with
measured beat keeping the pressure at
exactly fifteen pounds other men tended
coils of life-line and hose keeping these
and the braided telephone-cable free-
running at all times

  the fog swirled eerily the mist
deadened all ordinary sound transform-
ing the moving figures into dim wraiths
of gigantic proportions there was no
excitement aboard fireboat two under
the glaring flood-lights the men went
about their work quietly efficiently
many of them had brought navy dis-
cipline into this job no undue noise or
talk they were hosemen firemen en-
gineers paid to fight fire and do rescue
twenty thou-
sand bucks in a
suitcase see
well get it   
five grand goes
to you

work ashore and afloat diving duty for
sunken cars was nothing novel to them

  it occasioned far more interest and ex-
citement in the crowd on the pier-po-
lice land firemen reporters morbid gawk-
ers watchmen most of them knew the
procedure and discussed it as they watched
the distorted shapes under the flood-
lights

  usually the first diver located the car
in the deep mud made fast the hook-
rope and signaled topside to break the
car out of the swiftly clutching ooze
then his diving-time up he would be
hauled to the deck making his report to
the battalion chief in charge the sec-
ond or more experienced diver would
go down to open the car doors remove
the bodies within then bend on the
hook-rope preparatory to hoisting the car

a shadowy figure dropped from
the pier to the port side of the deck
where no one was working picking his
way over the tangle of gear he slipped
forward to the open door of the nozzle-

room inside on a stool towered a mon-
strous figure in diving dress but without
the helmet and weights brendan was
calmly finishing his pipe awaiting his
turn to go down he glanced up in as-
tonished recognition as the visitor came in

  runt welch was a waterfront rat of
repute as vicious as his face twitching
that long ratlike nose and staring with
blazing eyes that told their own story
rumored to be a snowbird and dope-
peddler he certainly was not a person
brendan would have expected to see
aboard welch came in and with a nod
of greeting sat down on an inhalator box
hello brendan looking for you
like hell brendans scarred heavy
features showed his contempt get out
of here before youre kicked ashore
welch grinned excitedly brendan
noted the glassy eyes the pinpoint pupils
he remembered that he himself was
practically helpless while encased in this
diving-suit
  no time to gam welch spoke rapid-
ly gunboat i got a five-thousand-dol-
lar diving-job for you

  brendan grunted a disdainful laugh
i dont do commercial diving runt
right now im doing a civilian diver out
o fifty bucks by hooking to this car
aint fair maybe but orders is orders
i hear tell this may be the police wagon
stolen after that hold-up job tonight
so it is said welch his eyes agleam
huh if you know it is run along
and tell the cops

  im telling you snapped welch i
drove that car see i was in it me and
denver red all the others got burned
then denver he got burned on the way
when a cop let go at us as we passed
him i come down through the fog
missed the turn and went off the pier
swum clear to a boat i got waiting

changed my rags and here i am fast
work 

  brendans blue eyes were wide

  my god if you aint all doped up
why you blasted little cockroach-
save it you big stiff spat out welch
i got to talk fast twenty thousand
bucks in a suitcase see pay-roll made
up at the bank we copped it sure its
under the back seat o that car gunboat
when you go down to hook on to the
car you slip out the suitcase and carry
it over to one of the pilings anchor it
you and me-well get it tomorrow night
with my boat five grand goes to you
brendan still stared in blank amaze-
ment he knew a dope-fiend when he
saw one and the runt was obviously all
hopped up the thing was incredible

  are you off your nut brendan
scowled suddenly a cheap rat like you
in on a hold-up not likely chase
yourself



krendans mind seemed
unable to function ho
 onhi think only of
i instate     k lie
growled to the tender
and eluiuped down the
iron ladder
  dry up snapped welch leaning for-
ward intently listen here denver
red aint been mugged or printed he
aint got a record see

  yvhats it to me snarled brendan
angrily get out of here you and
your orders to me-i dont know if
youre crazy or what

  youll know damned quick shot out
the other i know who denver red
was see and youre doing just what i
tell you gunboat you get that suit-
case out then you get denver out and
anchor him too then were all set
yeah denver has told me a lot about
you and about mother brendan too
brendan took the pipe from his mouth
and set it down he tried to speak and
could not his massive features were
suddenly gray as comprehension came to
him welch at these evidences of agita-
tion uttered a jeering laugh

  got the idea have you hughie
brendan-thats him all right your
kid brother and if they pull him up in
that car its good night you know
whatll bppen what itll mean when
the story breaks in the papers itll dish
you and your record itll dish her too
denver thought a lot o mother brendan
jie sure did now you big stiff youll
do what i tell you ill give you a ring
later tonight so behave

  he cocked his head listening then
suddenly rose darted out into the fog
and was gone he had heard some one
coming on the run

  brendan sat there in stark misery sick
of heart and soul his scarred features
agonized his huge fists clenched his
breath coming fast hughie gone to the
bad these two years vanished lost and
all the while mother brendan had prayed
for him every night and morning cer-
tain he would come back well if this
rat spoke truth he had come back

it was not of himself or his record that
bill thought this mattered little it
was of mother brendan and what the
story would mean to her

  probably it was not over thirty seconds
that he sat thus yet his brain moved in
the span of days and years hughie for
one thing all the ruined wastrel life of
the young fellow and what this news
would mean to the old mother no

pleasant prospect----then too there was

welch the rats words had unrolled an
entire panorama

  a boat waiting here somewhere in the
harbor close by the pay-roll made up

at the bank-yes all that had come in
over the radio broadcast-and welch
acting as driver probably in charge of the
waiting boat and the get-away three
of the gang shot down two away
in the stolen police-car and one of them
killed on the mad drive welch going
off the dead end in the fog-and below
hughie brendan waiting for his brother

  come on gunboat voices at the
door hasty excited jarred through him
got to go down cars there but how-
ard cut his hand on broken glass and
didnt get inside the cops think it may
be their car the one the bandits made a
get-away with probably one or two of
em are inside now

agony terror acute horror swept
 through gunboat brendan even to
move seemed rankly impossible for his
brain was frozen yet he found himself
mechanically rising two firemen helped
him from the nozzle-room across the deck
to another stool without a word he
sat while his heavy shoes were laced on

  one of the men was cursing softly
something about volunteer firemen-divers
who got no extra pay or merit-marks for
going into black depths foul with sunken
timbers cast-off wire hawsers saw-edged
boiler iron and whatnot any other time
brendan would have added a curse or
two on his own account but now his
mind seemed unable to function he
could only think of hughie who had
come home again it was paralyzing

  lead shoes lead belt copper breast-
plate then the telephone receivers over
his ears he tested the phones the
helmet was lowered over his head given
a quarter-turn and locked into position
he peered through the glass faceplate
tried his air-valve tested the exhaust
valve felt for his knife the wrench the
hanks of light line in his belt all this
done swiftly automatically

  o k  he growled to the tender and
clumped down the iron ladder

  no one could tell thanks to the hel-
met that his face was gray and drawn
that his eyes bulged with acute terror ber
hind the thick glass had runt welch
told the truth there was one way he
could be certain if a suitcase was under
the back seat of that car down below he
might be sure the story was true all
sense of sight was ruled out in the
depths he could see nothing but the
pay-roll suitcase the same one described
in the police radio broadcast was all the
proof he needed
  groping brendan found the car the
touch of it balanced him heartened him
with reality here he must work entirely
by feel he got the doors open he
touched the thing so limply awaiting
him and a sweat of horror bedewed his
scarred features the suitcase was there
the story was true this limp clay
aswing in the water was his brother

  satisfied of this he rallied he knew
the worst waist-deep in the ooze he
hauled hughie out as he lugged the
swinging body through the blackness
he could feel the tears on his cheeks the
air hissing through the intake-valve
seemed to choke him as he plowed along
now there was only one thing he could
do and not for his own sake but for that
of mother brendan he went grimly
ahead with the gruesome soul-rending
job

  for a hundred feet along the wharf

  creosoted piling was thrust down into
the sand and mud from his belt bren-
dan unhooked the light line cutting off a
length with his knife and by means of
this he anchored hughie to the piling

  he groped his way back to the car and
got the heavy suitcase back to the piling
again presently he had the suitcase
anchored there too if anything slipped
up now if for any reason a diver came
down here tomorrow he knew full well

  the implications and what it would meqp
  to him but the knowledge did not stag-
  ger him then he was back at the car
  again speaking through the helmet trans-
  mitter

    o k send down the hook-rope he
  told the tender up above his voice
  sounded heavy hoarse ready to send
  her up tell the chief ive searched the
  car nothing inside except the rear seat
  cushion floating no bodies

   when the rope came down and he
  hooked on the job was done

  when they brought brendan up he
  leaned heavily on the rail while the
  tenders unlocked and lifted off the hel-
  met one look at him and duke dumas
  spoke anxiously

    you look sick big boy whats
  wrong 

    im a bit off must have been some-
  thing i ate for supper brendan replied
  give me a hand over the rail

    they helped him to the deck stripped
  off the clammy suit wrapped him in
  blankets and gave him a slug of brandy
  he had the shivers sure enough they
  hustled him into fireboat three and sent
  him back to quarters

    after that fireboat two lifted the
  sunken car with her winch the eager re-
  porters and police finding it empty


   ill get everything and send it to the
 boat aye he said youve marked the
 piles you say  all right you can depend
 on me will there be fog tomorrow night
 you say sure every night for a week
 now

   so it was settled

 next evening fog was again rolling
 in past the point the battleships
 inside the breakwater were sounding at
 anchor signals and the giant bell that
 some authority had placed near fireboat
 twos berth was tolling its nerve-shatter-
 ing warning its voice fairly shaking the
 quarters of the boat crew there would
 be no sleep for the boys this night

   gunboat brendan on his regular off
 shift was ready for the dreaded job
 near midnight a little fishing-boat left
 its moorings at the landing near the yacht
 club and cautiously felt its way down the

brendangxunted i
didnt go to do tliat
confonnditinohelp
tor it now though
and no harm done
the world either

then her work done the boat went
hooting back through the fog to her ter-
minal island station

  brendan was still off his feed when the
chief looked in on him so they bundled
him into a car and sent him home for
him home was the wilmington bungalow
where he lived with mother brendan

  half an hour after he got there the
phone rang brendan answered the call
at sound of welchs thin and squeaky
voice he shivered again and felt sweat
on his face

  aye he said grimly everything
done tomorrow night its my shift
off yes

  he listened welch had the boat made
ready for the gang he the sole survivor
was now heir to all their preparations
he out of all those five men alone was
living and gunboat brendan knew that
he himself must now depend on this
cheap crook this contemptible scoundrel
of the waterfront

  channel to slip five in the boat lay a
  helmet and oxygen jacket brendan had
  bought that day from suicide svensons
  widow svenson had lost his life going
  after a fouled dredge anchor off the new
  breakwater extension brendan figured
  he could use the outfit himself later

    did you read about the job in the
  papers brendan asked

    welch grunted

    sure thing lucky they blasted them
  three mugs good and proper nobodys
  left to squeal about me and your brother
  somebody had tipped off the cops and
  they were all set for the mob

    who did the talking brendan in-
  quired and the other swore viciously

    i dunno monk hawley had a moll
  i dope it that she was sore on him and
  phoned in a tip to the cops cant tell
  brendan sensed suspicion defiance dis-
  trust in the manner of welch who point-
  edly kept him beyond arms reach he
  accepted the situation without argument


the blue book magazine

intent solely upon what now lay ahead
a man is what his background makes
him brendans one and only thought at
the moment was back in the bungalow
where this same night mother brendan
prayed for the return of hughie

the fishing-boat crept into slip five
with brendan forward and welch
at the helm she made fast to the piling
where fireboat two had lain the previous
night not a soul moved on the pier no
ship or tug navigated the fog-bound
channel welch was a long time in find-
ing the particular piles he had marked
the night before but at last he found
them and came down the ladder from the
dock platform

  all set the watchmans asleep in his
doghouse as usual were o k if some
other darn fool dont come along and run
his car off ready

  yeah grunted brendan he sent
down a shot line to the bottom hughie
would be there within a few feet of it then
he got out the diving jacket and helmet

  now listen he said it aint so hot
working in one of these gadgets at forty
feet if i get fouled down there im
liable to stay with hughie you handle
your end of the job right or were all sunk
together

  shoot and dont waste time said
welch impatiently this fog is cold as
hell

  sos the water down below brendan
countered grimly even in the fog and
dark he suspected from welchs position
that the smaller man was holding a pistol
first ill get up my brothers body
then after the suitcase comes up i want
to use this boat ill go out while the
fogs heavy and bury hughie in deep
water off the point

  sure sure you can have the damned
boat and five grand besides snarled
welch he did not move from where he
stood get on with the job

  brendan indicated the shot line see
this line i go down on it taking the
heaving line with me you hang on to
the heaving line from topside better
come forward and take it now and keep
it running free in the cockpit its apt
to get fouled

  as he spoke he flaked out the heaving
line on the little focsle it was dark up
forward the fog was thicker than ever
swirling around him distorting his fig-
ure out of all proportion the deck was
wet and slippery filmed with fish oil and
the grease of years

  welch peered at him intently but did
not move

  im staying here till you go down he
rejoined decisively his hand jerked up
a bit brendan was certain now that he
held a gun dont you try to pull noth-
ing on me gunboat i aint trusting
you a whole lot

  oh dont be a damned fool-
brendan swuqg around his feet
slipped and went out from under him
he fell with a crash half against the
little wheel-house a groan escaped him
as he lay in a twisted heap welchs
voice shrilled with alarm

hey whats the matter with you 
brendan moved tried to claw him-
self up and fell back with a subdued oath

  cant make it cant get up must
have twisted my back come here and
give me a hand you rat

  welch cursed softly viciously you
big lummox to go hurt yourself at a time
like this youre pulling something i
got a mind to blast you right now

  and bring everybody down on us
youre no such fool brendan laughed
harshly why you damned cokehead
im just as anxious as you are to get this
done my kid brothers down there wii
the crabs eating on him i cant get him
buried without your help and you know
it come on damn you give me a hand 
i guess youre right welch moved
forward reluctantly where you hurt
its my back jammed against the
wheel-house here i cant seem to get
on my feet brendan twisted again and
once more relaxed with a low gasp con-
found it all if i could just get up on
my legs id be all right this decks an
inch thick with slime come on get
your hands under my shoulders and lift
will you im stuck here

his suspicion dissipated welch came
and stood over the big helpless fig-
ure he leaned down got his hands
under brendans arms and pulled bren-
dan groaned

  it hurts but it helps get a better
grip now and well make it

  welch obeyed his hands well under
brendans arms he stooped to tug up-
ward

  of a sudden brendans arms clamped
in with tremendous pressure pinioning
welchs wrists a sharp yelp broke from
welch he lost balance the gun es-
caped his fingers he clutched frantical-
ly at brendan-and yelped again as he
fell

s
harbor hazard

  the two figures thrashed confusedly
about the little deck under a swirl of
thick fog twice more little convulsive
yelps broke from welch like the squeaks
of a cornered rat then came a subdued
thudding crash    presently brendan
scrambled to his feet

no alarm the sleeping watchman
had heard nothing the little boat
rocked quietly under the fog brendan
stooped to feel the limp figure at his feet
and grunted

  i didnt go to do that confound it
no help for it now though if his neck
broke he deserved it a dozen times over
and no harm done the world either

  he turned calmly to the equipment
he laced on the heavy lead shoes and
donned the diving jacket and helmet this
light shallow-water equipment would do
in such a pinch he made his prepara-
tions with unhurried care gunboat
brendan always took one thing at a
time and made sure it was right before
going ahead no more need to worry
about runt welch at least now to keep
the rendezvous with hughie no earthly
pay would have tempted him to under-
take what he was about to do for love
 gingerly he lowered himself down the
knotted shot line into the oily water
never had his huge gnarled paws stood
him in better stead than on this night
or done grimmer work once in the
blackness acute fear struck him never
before had he gone down without tenders
watching above now if the least thing
went wrong in the gripping ooze he
was lost

  better so however than with runt
welch waiting to kill him after the suit-
case was recovered he had cherished no
illusions regarding that mans intent

  even in this moment of gnawing re-
vulsion and fear he could not repress
a grim smile that curled his battered lips
like a snarl and a twisted thought that
came into his brain slantwise once he
had heard a frenetic soapbox orator
blaspheming about gods jokes the
phrase crept upon his mind gods jokes
well this was one and no mistake if
only runt welch had known the truth

  his outstretched hands came upon the
floating anchored thing and he shiv-
ered   

  when he had made fast his lines to
corpse and suitcase he went back topside
with the hiss of the oxygen fretting his
senses no tenders no helpers over the

side swirls of fog blacker thanever
he might have cast off his heavy weighted
shoes but brendan was a practical man
and this equipment had value he felt
his way up the line those big knotted
hands of his accomplished the impossible

  at length trembling with exhaustion
he was aboard he rid himself of the out-
fit and lay gathering his forces then he
rose on the slippery deck and fell to
work the worst of it was over anyhow

  he brought in the stiff streaming fig-
ure and the suitcase all its seals intact
from the focsle of the boat he dragged
some old canvas impartially he swathed
welch and the other in this canvas be-
fore finishing he secured welchs flash-
light and stole just one glimpse of the
face from the depths the recognition
of hughie steeled him to all he had
done and still must do

  he bound the two wrapped bodies
around and around with lobster-pot lines

  at hughies feet he secured the boats
anchor then he lifted the slippery
suitcase into the wheel-house took out
his diving-knife and slit one side of the
wet leather he felt inside and brought
out a number of pieces of metal and
flashed the light on them

  washers washers and junk he
muttered grimly those cops around
the boat last night sure told the truth
lucky thing it never got into the news-
papers or welch would have seen about
it a decoy suitcase the holdup had
been tipped off of course a decoy suit-
case and five men dead because of it
oh hughie boy-

  he checked back his threatening emo-
tion lugging the suitcase out again he
made it fast to the limp bundle that was
runt welch one of gods jokes sure
enough he told himself

  then starting the motor he cast off

at the entrance of slip five he took
 his departure from beacon eight
and headed down the main channel
toward the point he passed fireboat
two the b-platoon boys would be play-
ing cards down below he knew trying to
dull their senses to the damning toll of
the giant fog-bell so close beside that
bell dinned its unending solemn dirge as
he thrummed past and away into the
fog heading for barracuda flats and the
two-hundred-fathom depth that would
close the story

  and mother brendan would go on with
her prayers in blessed ignorance

another story in this fine new series will appear in an early issue


cjfhe christian

this sixth of these sagas of strange escape deals with an
englishman held captive by the moors and with the
unforeseen possibility that changed the world for him

for days now cotterel had been
glooming in the cell the shop the
yard scarcely speaking regard-
ing all around him with eyes of
sullen suspicion at last manning his
cellmate ventured a kindly inquiry

  leave me alone  cotterel burst out
keep to yourself keep your nose out
of my affairs im through with you
understand im applying to the war-
den tomorrow to change my cell and
that settles it im tired of your eternal
advice

  old manning in for life like cotterel
regarded the younger man with no re-
sponding heat in his wise gentle eyes

  this was the first savage break in
their friendship in all these months
they had occupied the same cell repeat-
edly had manning in his shrewd knowl-
edge of prison life intervened to save
cotterel from impulsive folly

  now he recognized the symptoms old
manning knew this to be the softest stir
in the country but behind the velvet
glove was a hand of iron he himself
was deserving of all he got cotterel
on the other hand was in for a crime he
had not committed manning felt this
to be true and sympathized he could
understand cotterels wild beating at the
bars but-change cells end their friend-
ship this was different

  he studied the haggard features the
desperate eyes the clenched lips of cot-

terel between the two had grown up
a strong and real friendship manning
liked his companion rarely himself a
lonely old man an artist who had gonff
wrong he had given himself without
stint to cotterel and until now had been
repaid in kind yet even now he saw
that this surly suspicious snapping
mood had something else behind it and
was not natural prison-wise as he was
knowing cotterel and others in this hell
on earth he could guess at the truth

  so he said in his silent deft way
youre figuring on a break again
none of your business snapped cot-
terel why in hell dont you keep to
yourself im done with you and your
blasted smooth talk every time some-
thing turns up you argue me out of it
suds jackson got away two weeks ago
id have been with him now if you
hadnt stuck your oar in shut up to
hell with you 

  manning ignored the savage glare the
acid words his affection for the young-
er man was too precious a thing to be so
dismissed this was not the first time
cotterel had been close to the lunatic
fringe

  if suds jackson could do it you can
do it eh he observed

shut up blurted cotterel angrily
manning persisted at the moment
there was no bar to their talking there
was no bar at any time for that matter

old manning had not uttered a word
aloud for years he was dumb

  his fingers spoke for him those
deft nimble fingers so apt at sketching
or engraving had put him behind the
bars during the months of companion-
ship cotterel had learned the finger-talk
he did not have to use it himself un-
less he liked for manning was not deaf
but it gave them relief from the rule of
silence that was clamped down now and
again

  suppose suds jackson had been shot
making the break he said and you
with him

  better be shot than here for life re-
joined cotterel

  ah this was better at least the
ice was broken cotterel was willing to
talk mannings fingers flew again and
the sullen gaze of cotterel was not
averted

  a curious thing manning went on
calmly very curious theres a possi-
bility that certainly has never occurred
to suds jackson and it has never oc-
curred to you it never would occur-

  im not interested broke in cot-
terel lay off i tell you  to hell with
you and your possibilities i know em
all

  not this one yet its perhaps the
greatest and most powerful of all the
possibility unseen and invisible the one
thing that you wouldnt think of cot-
terel im not interfering with anything
you want to do i agree that death
would be a blessed release from this
place id take a bullet myself for one
day of freedom just like forbes and
yet you cant afford to neglect the one
thing he neglected the one possibility
thats never foreseen the thought that
never occurred to him

cotterel lifted sultry eyes im
neglecting nothing if youve got
anything to say spit it out and get it
over youre not going to argue me out
of what i mean to do whos forbes

  manning smiled a whimsical touch in
his face

   argue not a bit of it i merely
 want to give you every possible weapon
 make sure you neglect nothing and this
 is something youve certainly neglected
 suds jackson neglected it

   cotterel scowled what are you talk-
 ing about suds jackson got clear and
 if it wasnt for you id be with him
 right now free

   manning nodded more sensitive than
 most the prison grapevine brought him
 odd bits of information that others
 missed only this afternoon he had
 heard something and he was expecting
 momentary confirmation at least it
 would serve him now as a basis on which
 to cast the dice for he must gamble if
 he were to save cotterel-and himself

   he did not blink the fact that he had
 a selfish interest in this friendship it


made this prison life at least endurable
gave him something rare and precious
for which to live and exist it was very
close now to being broken asunder in
cotterels desperate agony of soul

  dont be like forbes he said cot-
terel snarled an oath

  and whos forbes

  archibald forbes a scot a young
fellow like you if you want me to tell
you whats in my mind you must let
me do it my own way cotterel i cant
make you see the importance of this un-
seen possibility unless you agree and
its vitally important to you if you aim
to get away

  cotterel gave him a sulky stare

  all right i know theres a catch in
it but go ahead it wont have any
effect im bound to get out and im
certain about everything and i dont
give a damn if i do get a bullet
manning laughed in his silent way
that sounds like forbes he was a
prisoner in meknes the capital of mo-
rocco when that country was a real
empire at the close of the seventeenth
century the emperor ismail was prob-
ably the most despotic monarch the
world ever knew he set up the doc-
trine that morocco and everything and
everyone in it was all his absolute per-
sonal property he got away with it
why demanded cotterel as the
other paused

  manning gave no sign that this indi-
cation of interest delighted his heart

  because he was both cruel and smart
so cruel that everyone stood in deathly
fear of him it was calculated that in
the course of his life he had killed twen-
ty-five thousand people with his own
hand so smart nobody could outwit
him and personally so brave and able
that none of his bravest men singly or
in crowds could stand against him with
any weapon he was a phenomenon

ounds like it grunted cotterel
wasnt he the guy who had a lot
of christian slaves

  about thirty thousand-and forbes
was one of them ismail used those
slaves and his own people as well to
build the immense walls of meknes in-
credible walls defenses palaces he had
fifty palaces five hundred wives and
around a thousand sons-the daughters
were strangled at birth however lets
stick to forbes

  he was a scots seaman taken aboard
some ship the sallee rovers brought in

and like all other christian captives was
sent as a slave to meknes we know
every detail of his story of his marvelous
escape ismail never freed any slaves
until they were too worn out for further
work then hed let the redemptionist
fathers ransom them these fathers
were allowed to live in meknes and gave
their lives to the redemption of chris-
tian captives from among the moors
theyve left us the story of forbes

  he was one of those wiry men not
bulging with muscle but of superhuman
ability to endure such men accomplish
the impossible

  manning paused then his flying fin-
gers went on with the astonishing story
of forbes enclosed in such a prison as
the world has seldom known-a prison
such as russia or germany today af-
fords in which the prison consists of the
entire country

forbes was intelligent shrewd able
he spent a couple of years in this liv-
ing hell before reaching the point where
he chose death rather than more of it he
must escape or go under and death
would be welcome release for a time
he worked around the menagerie main-
tained by the emperor ismail the pal-
ace grounds surrounded by a triple wall
were of incredible size-the stable alone
contained a thousand horses ismail had
a huge menagerie and did not hesitate
to fight with the wild beasts himself he
thought nothing of throwing a slave to
the lions or a soldier or one of his
courtiers one day he threw forbes to
them but the lions knew him and left
him alone so ismail put him on the
hard-labor gang the building gang and
with this forbes knew he was a goner
and determined to escape or die

  the daily life facing him was beyond
description that any man could sur-
vive under such conditions was past be-
lief yet a standing force of some thirty
thousand christians and as many ber-
bers and arabs was maintained the
slave quarters in meknes consisted of
vast chambers partly underground where
the slaves were huddled like wild beasts
in filth and rags after it was too dark to
work here they were herded by a regu-
lar night guard a burly andalusian
moor who beat or tortured them at will
with earliest dawn they were again tak-
en out in stumbling hordes to the labor

  the building operations of which is-
mail himself was architect and chief
overseer were simple the enormous


massive walls ran for uncounted miles
they consisted of a mastic a mixture
of sand with limestone and gravel
pounded down between forms of timber
when a slave was killed or died he was
pounded into the walls with the mastic
the walls of meknes today are filled
with christian bones 

  the food was starvation diet the
work was severe berbers and arabs
criminals or rebellious subjects were
mingled with the christians for ismail
himself a black ruled with black su-
danese soldiers and ground down the
arabs beyond any rebellion his was a
throne of blood ruled with sharp steel

  at all times the labor was pressed but
especially when ismail appeared if it
did not go to his liking he used sword
and spear in a passionate frenzy he was
mad with the desire to build more
walls he cut down slave soldier noble
or prime minister alike in more hu-
mane moments his chief feat of prowess
was to mount his horse and in the same
flowing motion behead the man who held
his stirrup he was equally capable of
fighting an enraged lion armed only
with his sword

  he prodded the hapless slaves to super-
ifuman exertions they died like flies
more came in every day to replace them
from ships captured by the barbary
rovers spanish english french italian
-all nations mingled here in a hell of
sweating death

  forbes resolved to escape

  his red hair and blue eyes were not
against him morocco was full of ber-
bers with similar complexions he was
hard as nails emaciated hairy powerful
soon he would lose strength and courage
and hope like some of them who had
been here twenty and thirty years now
was the time if ever he spoke arabic
with moderate fluency

  escape by day was simply unthink-
able  evasion by night was the only way
but escape was utterly impossible he
knew it well enough many a man had
tried here were two spaniards who had
tried hard vigorous men now they
labored in chains after having been
beaten and tortured out of human sem-
blance

  forbes weighed the chances coolly
with luck he might do it without not

  the night guard the jail doors-the
first step once out of this prison he
would be in the city in meknes gates
closed and walls patrolled once out of
meknes he would have the olive or-



well dog tell
me the plot quick-
ly   what is
their plan

chards of the valley-and beyond those
desert and mountain to reach the sea-
coast across those leagues of stony des-
ert and savage mountain where he would
be hunted day and night where every
mans hand would be against him with
fanatic religious hatred where he could
find no food and little water was an
appalling gamble

  and when he reached the sea-coast he
would find only moors ismail had
driven all the christian powers out of
morocco the spaniards alone held foot-
ing at ceuta their other places had
fallen the portuguese had been driven
out the english had been driven out
of tangier ismail all but supreme in
conquest of the christian had decreed
that morocco should wear only yellow
slippers henceforth as a token of re-
joicing they are still universally worn
today though the reason is forgotten by
the wearers

that the obstacles were insuperable
forbes knew he accepted them
there was only one thing he did not
anticipate-the one thing no prisoner
thinks about when contemplating escape

  this one thing never occurred to him
it never occurs to anyone until too late
what was it wait

  in this land of blood where death was
at ones elbow day and night where
heads were piled by the thousand in the
marketplace after every campaign forbes
was well aware that except by spilling
blood he could not escape in fact he
had a few scores he was only too anxious
to pay off in moorish blood

  he had watched the emperor closely
he knew ismail was no madman as
some called him but a very deep and
crafty fellow aiming to hold by fear a
throne that had destroyed its occupants
hitherto very quickly and from this
forbes got his prime idea others had
tried to escape by stealth by hiding by
slippery evasion he would eschew all
these things

  in this land of blood he would do
what no one else had done-escape by
blood so having weighed every detail
forbes awaited his chance it was the
rainy season and he wanted a night of
rain   

  it came a thin fine drizzle of rain
when moors were huddled to the very
eyes in the hoods of their jellabs ismail
had come out to speed the work that
day he had killed two overseers had
ordered a chief overseer drawn through
the city at the tail of a horse and then
impaled and had ordered that a double
portion of work be finished on the mor-
row the prison was filled with groans
and lamentations the morrow would see
wretched backs red with whip-strokes

  forbes slept a little past midnight
he wakened the burly andalusian
jingling his bunch of keys was passing
among the huddled sleepers amusing
himself by kicking one and another

out of tlie way
snarled tlie moor
his whip slaslied
forbes laughed-
laughed as his
knire flashed

forbes beckoned him and he came
grinning

  well dog of an englishman what
is it

  quiet murmured forbes with a
cautious look around if i tell you of a
plot to escape i there a reward
aye by allah   the other grinned
again who 

  i cant tell you here theyd kill
me take me outside with you

  the andalusian launched a kick at
him and emitted a roar

  up dog up come with me i have
a pleasant little task for you-its time
the latrines were cleaned come on
come on 

  with a simulated groan forbes rose
and followed the andalusian had his
home in a room at the prison gate where
he could call guards if necessary they
were seldom needed so broken and worn
in body and spirit were these slaves

in this hovel of his own where a lamp
burned dimly the andalusian turned
forbes had seen into this room twice a
day morning and evening he knew
everything in it knew exactly what he
would do on this occasion he came in
and closed the door

  well dog tell me the plot quick-
ly who is in it

  the three spaniards who came last
week said forbes crossing to the far-
ther wall where a stout bar of oak leaned
in a corner


 by allah and allah exclaimed the
keeper what is their plan

i the only reply of forbes was to catch
up the oak bar whirl it and strike the
blow cut short the alarm-shout of the
andalusian  and the burly man collapsed
with his skull shattered

  forbes listened the closed door the
rain had silenced the cry there was
no alarm now unhurriedly he went
about his business

first he ate food was here and
water he filled himself for the first
time in over two years cold couscous
dates bread he made into small packets
and laid aside he hacked off his long
matted hair and shaved his skull moor-
ish fashion leaving only the one lock of
hair by which the angel would presum-
ably carry him to paradise he trimmed
his beard roughly and then dressed him-
self in what clothes he could find here-
baggy linen trousers a dirty white robe
and over all an old brown jellab on
his horny naked feet he put the yellow
slippers of the keeper

  around his neck he slung the long
curved knife taken from the dead man
he found a little money a few coins of
copper and silver which he took gladly
then aware that earliest dawn would
find him the object of a frenzied and de-
termined search he took the keys opened
the main doors and slipped out into the
street the drizzle of rain kept any
guards close hood pulled over head
he shuffled along the streets of pounded
earth until he found the place he sought
-a dim light coming from behind
screens at a doorway that was never
closed

  this was the grand mesjid or mosque
as the french called it on the market
square no christian had ever been in-
side it but forbes had picked up bounti-
ful knowledge

  he turned in at the entrance the
doorkeeper was snoring blissfully leav-
ing his slippers now mud-splashed past
recognition beside the sleeper forbes
made for the courtyard of ablutions
here he was alone with a dim-burning
lamp stripping he enjoyed the lux-
ury of a thorough wash at the huge basin
of living water this was not only a
luxury but a necessity the slave-odor
was an identifying thing stronger even
than the stench which clung to the open-
sewage streets of every arab town once
rid of this odor-and at no other time
of the day or night could he have thus

rid himself of it-he could breathe more
easily both literally and figuratively

  veiled once more in his damp jellab
he turned his steps toward the interior of
the mosque here upon a corner of one
of the great carpets he sank down with
a sigh of relief freed himself of the
jellab and made a number of prostra-
tions toward the mihrab the niche that
faced toward mecca in the moslem
manner it was merely a precaution in
case he had attracted any attention

  this vast interior was not empty
lamps lit the gorgeous tiles of the walls
the curious arabic inscriptions the lacy
carved and painted plaster-work the
carved and painted beams the screens
here and there dim figures were
sprawled here and there some in slum-
ber others in meditation a furiously
dirty holy man from some marabout
outside the city naked except for loin-
cloth and shaggy hair leaned against a
pillar and mechanically murmured ko-
ranic verses occasional snores sounded

  as forbes knew to these people a
mosque was more than a place to which
men came for prayer at the appointed
hours it was a place for gossip and
meeting for meditation for rest and
study and enjoyment of beauty it wtas
an escape from the world of blood and
death around for him it was safety

  no one would dream of looking for
him here-where if discovered he would
be torn to shreds by the hands of en-
raged fanatics he needed no jellab to
hide him his shaven skull with its top-
knot was the mark of a moslem and no
one would give him even a passing sec-
ond glance that naked holy man by
the pillar had the shaggy red hair of a
berber even redder than forbes own

  leaning against the wall forbes slept

a clamor of voices startled him
wide awake someone in passing
gave him a kick a friendly admonition
it was the moment of early morning
prayer the quavering voice of the blind
muezzin came faintly from the high
minaret above though flags frequently
took the place of muezzins in morocco
men were trooping in all around

  forbes did not know the prayers he
did not need to know them so long as
there was no suspicion aroused he
prostrated himself as the others did he
moved his lips as he rose from each bow
and amid the babel of voices his own was
not missed someone during the night
had left a rosary of black beads in the


corner near-by forbes appropriated it
leaned back against the wall dropped
his beard on his breast and closed his
eyes and sat fingering the rosary in pre-
sumed meditation like many another

  even now he knew the search was
on gossip around him confirmed this

  el andalous with his head bashed in
-by allah a blow the christian dog
got away but theyll find him the
city is being searched hes hiding in
the palace grounds they say

  the hours passed as each prayer-hour
came forbes went through the ritual
it was beginning to get on his nerves but
he squelched down the gusty fear and
forced himself to it all around men
came in talked business ate gossiped
prayed forbes ate also he listened
slept clutched the rosary ostentatiously
gave himself up to delicious rest

the long day droned through its
length at last came the prayer of
sunset as the crowd flooded out forbes
mingled with it hood over head he got
his mud-splashed slippers at the entrance
and passed out into the street

  shuffling along the narrow twisting
ways he stopped at a bakers booth
bought more bread stopped at another
booth and bought dried dates he was
near the mellan now the quarter of the
jews the ghetto near the gates another
mosque was here and he entered it bold-
ly enough

  all night he remained here and in the
morning after the sunrise prayer took
up anew his challenge to destiny thus
far his scheme had succeeded admi-
rably now to leave the city

  here he had picked his time and his
place very shrewdly outside these
walls was the animal market where for
a swarming mile the yellow ground was
thronged with asses horses camels with
buyers from the city with country-folk
and lean berbers from the hills further
it was friday the one day when all the
native women poured forth to the ceme-
teries on the hillsides

  forbes had reckoned aright and joined
the throng seeking egress the day was
fairand sunny already the dust rose in
thick shimmering clouds the stalwart
black sudanese troops of ismail the
blacks whom he bred like animals and
educated from earliest youth to savage
soldiering paid little heed as the gab-
bling crowds flowed past behind him
forbes beheld the high massive towers
and walls fall away he was free

  the fact gave him no elation he was
tensed to meet the perils ahead he
still had a little money left and food
was now the first thing to settle first
food then transport

he made his way along the dusty
lanes of the animal market unhur-
ried stopping now and again to buy
more food and eat it or stow it safely
away action was drawing close upon
him as he knew well when the moment
came he must strike hard and without
mercy but he must choose the moment
aright or lose everything

 the heat of the day came on and
found him a little way out of the throngs
and dust resting beneath an olive tree
watching with hawk gaze the yellowish
highway that wound away from the city
and the market through the olive val-
leys into meknes poured the endless
groups of wagons and animals bearing
building materials levied from all parts
of the empire  bands of slaves trudging
along parties of soldiers country-folk
eased away from the markets of the city

  presently in the hot lull of noon
forbes saw that his moment was come
to his left the road dipped beyond
sight of the animal market that wa
why he had chosen this spot coming
from the market to his right heaped
high on the rump of his ass in the native
style was a man a man of some im-
portance to judge from his snowy robes
no doubt some town gentleman going
out to his country estate or his olive
orchard

  forbes rose and strode on down into
the dip and waited the proud moor
came along on the sturdily trotting little
animal and forbes turned with a whine

  alms sidi alms in the name of
allah

  go ask of allah for hes richer than
i am snarled the moor out of the
way 

  his whip slashed down across the face
of forbes and forbes laughed-laughed
as he sprang as his knife flashed as the
moor died

 tugging the body aside among he
trees he stripped it found money and
took that came back to the ass and
mounted sitting a-crupper like the na-
tives clad now in the snow-white jellab
of fine wool he pulled the hood about
his head to keep out the sun and fled

  another barrier was past there re-
mained the leagues of desert the snowy
atlas mountains the sea-coast beyond
thesleilianran in
with drawn sword
ou t of the dust a nd
blood rose forbes
hurling ills pistol

into the dark face

  mile after mile the little animal put
behind at its speedy trot the sun was
at the horizon when forbes heading his
makeshift mount down into a steep
gully still following the dusty track of
the road perforce came slap upon a doz-
en of ismails black soldiers horsemen
escorting a wagon laden with tribute
grain

  he scuttled past with a muttered
greeting forbes knew very well that he
could not hope to pass for a native at
close quarters though his knowledge of
the language was enough to serve in a
pinch he saw the eyes of the blacks roll
enviously as he passed this sleek ass
though nearly worthless in the open
country was a valuable piece of property
in the city and the soldiers were head-
ing for meknes

  one of them turned his horse with a
laugh and struck back down the gully

forbes heard the horseman follow-
ing him as he reached the trickling
stream at the bottom he heard the order
to halt and obeyed it dismounting he
stood silent as the horseman reined in
with a flood of negroid arabic forbes
could not understand the words at all



but he understood that this black was
taking the ass these swaggering su-
danese took what they liked from any
arab and ismail stood behind them

  not dreaming of any resistance from
this townsman the soldier leaned far
over in the saddle to catch the reins of
the ass as he leaned the curved knife
of forbes flashed in the sunset and
flashed again more redly with a
choked cry the black pitched out of
the saddle headlong

  forbes caught the horse swung up in-
to the high saddle and rode away at
speed nor slackened pace until the dusk
of evening closed around him a wild
exultation filled his heart now he had
everything-a good horse a water-bottle
dried dates in plenty and the stars to
guide him

  during two days he kept on his way
avoiding the scattered villages drifting
ever toward the mountains and the coast
on the second day he ran into a party of
arabs hunting there was no evading
them so he rode among them boldly

  a renegade said he going an errand
for the emperor the lie got him through

  there were hundreds of renegades-
poor devils who had changed their faith
the blue book magazine

to save themselves from torture an en-
tire province had been stripped of in-
habitants and given them to occupy
greeks french italians spanish dutch
and others they and the black troops
were ismails favorites

  on the next day as though in answer
to his lie forbes ran into two of them
an englishman and a sicilian the two
were alone riding for meknes he tried
to steer clear of them but they ran
him down they were cruel bitter hard
men of wrecked lives and blasted fu-
ture and the englishman was by far
the worse of the two he had a pistol
and his sharp eye perceived the truth

  youre no arab by the way you
ride said he hauling out his pistol
and no berber either ha comrade
heres an escaped slave

  have ye no bowels o mercy spat
out forbes in english seeing the dark
sicilian reaching for sword or knife and
the pistol cocked let be and go your
way the lord will bless you for it

  and have that jabbering italian yon-
der peach on me not much said the
other coolly english yourself are you 
scotch by the burr of your tongue turn
around and ride with us and lucky we
dont make you walk with your hands
tied to our stirrups

forbes uttered a groan of despair
and the two laughed heartily in the
midst they ceased to laugh forbes
launched himself from the saddle caught
the englishman about the body and fell
with him in the dust the pistol missed
fire but the knife drove home

  the sicilian dismounted and ran in
upon them with drawn sword out of
the dust and blood rose forbes hurling
the pistol into the dark face following
it with his knife the sword caught
him over the scalp but his point slid
home again a brief and savage blur of
fighting figures that ended with two men
dead who were better dead perhaps and
forbes with three horses and a gash over
his skull

  it was this wound that did for him

  his own horse was the best of the
three with it with the pistol and pow-
der and ball with more looted food he
pressed on hard and fast he got into
the hills and there made himself a camp
near water for fever was in his wound
and he could scarcely keep his feet and
his saddle not at all

  two days he lay all but senseless
helpless in delirium he came to him-

self weak but clear-headed he was on
the mend the horse had wandered
away no matter there were the hills
and there wound a dusty ribbon of road
piercing them-the road to the sea

  food heartened him water did not
lack and he remained here another day
to gain strength hope grew in him
he had passed the worst barriers now
by following that road of nights and
lying hid by day he would reach the
coast he had food and weapons and a
little money his future was assured
provided he could steal some sort of
boat at the coast and get to sea

  grimly he struggled on and on

days passed afoot he reached the
mountains gaunt hawk-eyed alert
worn to skin and bone he got through
them starving now he killed a berber
shepherd and drank the blood of a
slaughtered sheep and staggered on hid-
ing by day footing it by night he
followed trails that ever led him north-
ward and a little west

  came the day when crouching amid
thorn-brush and cactus as a train of
horsemen passed he heard their talk and
learned that he was in the territory of
the pasha of tetuan this clarifiefl
everything for him that afternoon
late he had his first glimpse of the sea
-a blue glitter of water far away but
certain

  he sat down then and shook with
passionate sobs until tears were ex-
hausted

  all that night he went on his way
spurred by a fervor that surmounted
weariness and bloody feet and hunger
that overheard conversation had changed
all his plans now he need not worry
about the last barrier he was close to
the spanish territory of ceuta he had
only to reach the spanish lines to be
safe for ever the joyous thrill of it
pounded in his veins and pulsed through
his whole being safe

  toward dawn he heard the dogs of
a village barking and began to pick his
way around the place it was no easy
matter for the fields were marked out
by hedges of enormous cactus hundreds
of years old the dogs aware of him
kept up their noise the false dawn was
graying the east when in avoiding a
cactus-patch forbes lost his footing and
tumbled into a rocky pit

  he struck headfirst his half-healed
wound was opened and he lay senseless
when he wakened to consciousness he
the christian slave

was lying in the village with chains on
his wrist and feet his escape had come
to its end

with this old mannings fingers fell
as though his story had come to an
end he leaned back wearily with an
air of finality and closed his eyes

  cotterel stared at him with a look of
shock in his eyes then spoke

  but look here youve not finished
what became of forbes

  manning looked up and his hands
moved i dont know what became of
him he was taken back to meknes
thats all we know probably he lies in
those enormous rotting walls today
but still i dont understand cot-
terel had come out of his savage hos-
tile mood the abrupt finish of the
story the transition from suspense and
triumph ahead to frightful disaster had
wakened his brain he was more like
his usual self now and manning who
had played for that very aim was thank-
ful to see it

  what has that story got to do with
me went on cotterel gripped by
curiosity and interest i can see a cer-
tain analogy in the situation yes but
idont see where the escape of forbes
has anything to do with whatever try
at a break i might make

  on the contrary it has everything
to do with you manning replied i
know you dont get the point old man
i didnt want to make it too clear at
first i mentioned one thing that didnt
occur to him that never occurs to any-
one in such a situation it didnt occur
to suds jackson when he made his suc-
cessful break recently it didnt occur
to you and naturally it wouldnt
yes cotterel frowned i re-
member whats that thing

  wait  manning made a warning
gesture and leaned forward listening
intently

  cotterel could hear nothing yet
through the murmurous silence of the
prison he realized the grapevine must
be at work-the grapevine which car-
ried news old manning was aware of
it but cotterel was not it took years
instead of mere months to be able to
grasp the slight sounds the telegraphic
sounds which eluded even the ears of
the prison guards

  manning was getting something a
blaze came into his eyes his head jerked

up his lips moved soundlessly then he
turned abruptly to cotterel

  suppose you succeeded in making a
break son youd be about the best-
known man in america from the police
standpoint thered be no safety any-
where for you

  cotterel gestured disdainfully

  i dont care about that im going to
be free again if only for a day or so
i crave the free air just to stand once
on a hillside under the blue sky and be
free 

  precisely that proves the point im
trying to make manning smiled slight-
ly you think of freedom day and
night just as forbes did the one thing
that never occurred to him that has
never occurred to you either the unseen
possibility that never occurred to suds
jackson when he succeeded in his break
i dont mean the fear of death-

  he broke off and then resumed abrupt-
ly his fingers flying fast

  do you know what i just got from
the grapevine that suds jackson will
be back tomorrow hes been recap-
tured and alive

  ohhell thats too bad cotterel
caught his breath sharply oh i see
you think that possibility hadnt oc-
curred to me

  no not at all said mannings fin-
gers think of forbes in the moment
when he passed again between the gates
of meknes and into the slave prison
think of suds jackson when tomorrow
hes brought back inside these gates
thats the unseen possibility the in-
evitable moment not of death but of
return

  cotterels eyes dilated oh i see-
i see youre right the moment of
return of being brought back here-
just that said manning

cotterel lowered his head a lit-
tle shiver passed through him as he
sat motionless and silent after a time
he looked up met the gaze of manning
and wiped fine perspiration from his
forehead

  i get the point he said suddenly
i-i-damn it youre right i guess
ive been the worlds prize fool man-
ning just the bare thought of that mo-
ment of return gives me the creeps im
sorry for everything i said forgive me
wont you

jfot zmetal

illustrated by grattan condon

on a friday afternoon in the
 open hearth of the aurora
i steel and foundry the hoist-
cable on the hot-metal crane
tore loose from the eye of the ladle-beam
and a hundred tons of molten metal ran
five feet deep on the floor of the pit-level

  walt anthony knew it was going to
happen he had known for a long time
that some day the cable the hook or one
of the ladle-lugs would break and a
ladle of hot steel would drop and he
was sure hed be in the hot-metal crane
cabin when it happened and be burned
to a cinder

  the hot-metal crane cabin is no place
for a man who feels the way walt did

  the job pays well but it is dangerous
  it demands an expert craftsmanship an
  ability to endure excessive heat and an
  acceptance of the fact that the first mis-
  take made will quite likely be the last
  one hot-metal crane-men are the aris-
  tocrats of their craft and look it they
  are usually small wiry men with faces
  drawn lean by the tension under which
  they work they have the sharp look of
  high-flying birds in their eyes and open
  hearth men say their nerves are insu-
  lated with ice

the hot-metal crane-man services the
furnaces with pig-iron taken from the
mixer or direct from the blast furnaces
and poured through the charging-doors

you will not soon forget this virile story of men and steel by
a two-fisted writing-man who knows a lot about both

by owen francis

and he hoists the heats from the pits to
the pouring-platform after steel has been
made the crane is built for the han-
dling of ladles at the end of the hoist-
cables hangs a ladle-beam a heavy bar
of steel longer than a ladles depth from
the beam extend two massive arms whose
lower ends have been shaped in wide
hooks not unlike stiff-hanging partly
closed hands when a ladle is to be
hoisted the beam is lowered over the
ladle top the arms reaching down the
ladle sides below the rim of the ladles
top are two lugs which are rounded to
fit the cupped-palm ends of the arms
with the lugs in the hooks the ladle can
be raised in an even lift

  free of the floor the ladle can be
moved in any direction the crane-man
chooses it can be raised or lowered it
can be racked toward him or away from
him across the width of the open hearth
or by moving the crane along its tracks
the ladle can be carried the entire length
of the open hearth building

  when steel is tapped from a furnace
it pours into a ladle in the pit beneath
the tapping-spout with a capacity of
eighty or a hundred tons the deep cup-
like ladle brims with boiling steel when
the furnace run is over the hot-metal
crane-man then lifts the ladle from the
pit swings it beneath him and carries
it to the pouring-platform
  the molten steel pours into the ingot
molds through a hole in the ladle bottom
a hole opened and closed by a long lever
operated by workers on the pouring plat-
form because of this fact it is neces-
sary for the ladle to be directly above the
comparatively small top of the mold
moving the ladle beneath him where he
can accurately judge the position of the
ingot molds the crane-man looks down
from the crane cabin twenty feet above

  if the crane breaks during this opera-
tion or if the crane-man makes a serious
error in judging height or distance the
molten steel will dump on the pit-level
floor the workers on the pouring-plat-
form may escape if given time enough
but the crane-man has little chance to do
so the terrific heat will no doubt burn
through the cranes power-line insulation
and cause a short circuit or the lift may
jam making movement of the crane im-
possible for a few precious minutes in
either case the crane-man is trapped
above a blazing inferno it is also quite
likely that the steel will explode if
there is water in the pits and more often
than not there is an explosion takes place
from steam generated instantaneously
when the molten metal comes in contact
with the water the explosion hurls the
molten lavalike mass upward like the
sudden spouting of a volcano

walt anthony wasnt the hot-metal
crane-man but he was going to be
he was second crane-man  it was his job
to hoist slag-boxes move bundles of ravel-
rods set charging-spouts answer the rap-
pings of the labor-gang straw-boss and
do the everyday run-of-the-mill hoisting
but he was slated for the hot-metal job
when doots gallegher either died from
old age or quit either of which could be
logically expected thinking of the day
when he would have to climb into the
hot-metal crane cabin and swing a ladle
of molten steel beneath him made walt
feel cold and clammy all over he
didnt tell anyone how he felt or what
he thought he knew he was afraid and
was ashamed of it so he did the best
he could to keep the others from knowing
and hoped desperately a miracle would
happen so the day would never come
when they sent him up on the hot-metal
crane and found out what kind of man he
was

  walt liked cranes he liked to sit in
the second-crane cabin rolling hell-bent
down the open hearth acting uncon-
cerned about going through the lower end

and out into tlie mill yard with dis-
aster near at hand he would sprag the
crane so evenly that the wheels kissed the
bumper at the tracks end without a jar
and he liked to set a slag-box down
knowing that in his hand that worked the
controls he held the lives of the men on
the floor below that never bothered
the men of the melting-floor

  walt could drop the hook and break
a toothpick laid lengthwise on the melt-
ing-floor and the men knew it they had
confidence in him and showed it each day
by the casual way they walked under his
swaying lifts that was one of the reasons
walt couldnt tell them he was afraid

  being swung in the air forty feet above
the pit-level floor and cooped in a four-by-
six cabin alone for eight hours a day with
nothing but the roar of the furnaces for
company walt had the cranemans
habit of talking to his crane he called
his crane maggie and when the rapping
started for a lift to be made walt would
often say

  all right maggie here we go and
dont creak and groan like that about it
either i gave you a shot of oil this
morning that should make you giddy 
thats better now we lower away
turn the hook so the cinder-man dont
lose time and now we hoist nice and
gentle until were free of the floor

  by that time the lift would be in the
air hed give maggie the juice and the
job would be over quicker than any other
crane-man in the mill could do it

  he knew every bolt nut beam cable
and wire on maggies huge frame he
knew her from armature to switch from
control-lever to the chip in the wheel on
the other end of her fifty-foot span and
he had for maggie the affection a good
craftsman has for his tools

  with the hot-metal crane it was dif-
ferent it scared him for he knew some
day a ladle would fall the fear hadnt
been with him at first he started in
the open hearth eight years before and
for the past six had been running maggie
one day two years ago when work was
slack hed sat in maggies cabin watch-
ing the hot-metal crane-man hoist a ladle
from the pit the thought suddenly came
to him of what would happen if the ladle
fell and a hundred tons of white-hot
metal spilled on the pit floor the crane-
man wouldnt have a chance hed be
trapped in his four-by-six cage and burn

  walt thought about it until the pic-
ture became so vivid he couldnt get it
out of his mind the more he thought
about it the more he thought about the
day when doots gallegher stepped down
and he was promoted to the hot-metal
crane job

  he lived in constant dread of the day
when the other men in the open hearth
found out he was afraid and for the
first time in his life he began worrying
over how small he was-small for an
open-hearth man certainly he was
only five feet six inches and wouldnt
weigh more than a hundred and sixty
pounds being small was an asset rather
than a handicap in the compact crane-
cabin but walt began feeling he had to
prove to anyone who would listen that his
size didnt mean a lack of courage every
time the opportunity presented itself he
would say

  why dont old doots get wise to him-
self and quit  hes too old to have nerve
enough to swing a ladle out of the pit
he just eases them out ive been itching
for a chance for six years

  but he knew he lied and some day
they would all know if it hadnt been
for willie he would have quit the job
two years ago and taken a crane-mans
job over in the bloomer or finishing-mills
millie was the twenty-year-old daughter
or joe regan the melter foreman she
had brown eyes taffy-colored hair and
was the prettiest girl walt had ever seen
and she was as proud of walt as any
mill-sweetheart ever was millie thought
that running the hot-metal crane was the
best and most important job in the mill
every evening when walt went to see
her she would start talking about it
telling her father how happy shed be
when walt got the job joe regan would
grin and slap on the back

  walt aint built big like first-helpers
have to be but hes got more guts that
hot-metal crane needs that

  it always made walt feel ashamed and
he would try to change the subject mil-
lie would laugh and say

  look dad hes modest

it made walt sick at heart for millie
to think he was so brave when he was
afraid he loved millie so much he
didnt want to fool her he wanted to put
his arms around her and tell her just how
he felt and he wanted her to under-
-stand and be happy with him keeping the
job on the second crane but he knew
ij millie ever found out shed give his
ring back and probably marry bill
raugh bill was the six-foot first-helper
who worked for joe regan and could

ixok hes modestmillie would laugh

whip any man in the mill he still
looked at millie with love in his eyes al-
though she was wearing walts ring the
hot-metal crane job made a difference
with millie but walt still wanted to tell
her sitting one evening with millie on
the porch he had started to explain how
it was but she had laughed and said
how proud she was of him after that
he could never get started again

  wishing there was a way out of the
situation but knowing there wasnt walt
stayed on running the second crane he
had rolled maggie to the lower end to be
out of the hot-metal cranes way when
he saw snouts the labor-gang straw-boss
wave in signal that he was wanted on the
pit-level thinking snouts wanted to
borrow a dollar or so until the eagle
shrieked walt eased maggie alongside
the ladder and climbed down

  whats on your mind snouts want
to borrow a couple bucks

   snouts never wasted conversation that
didnt concern money or the labor-gang
he jerked his head in the general direc-
tion of the open hearth office

   mr bennet he said

  walt felt a cold clammy shiver run
over him mr bennet the open hearth
superintendent called men in the office
for only three reasons to hire to fire or
to promote walt knew that doots had
quit at last and he was to be given the
hot-metal job

  he walked slowly toward the super-
intendents office knowing what he was
going to do he had thought it over
and had planned that when the day
came he would bluff it out pretending to
be very pleased over the job the first
time he climbed the ladder to the hot-
metal crane he would let go the rung as
he reached the top and fall to the steel
melting-floor he knew that it would be
easier than pulling a control-lever that
swung a ladle full of boiling steel be-
neath him at least they would think it
was an accident and no one would ever
know he was afraid

  forcing a smile to his face and throw-
ing back his shoulders he went into the
office hoping mr bennet couldnt see the
fear through his grin

  mr bennet looked up from his desk

  i wanted to tell you this myself
walt he said

  yes sir what is it walt asked as if
he didnt know

  doots gallegher is taking a month
off and were too busy to break in a new
man

walt swallowed hard but managed
to smile more cheerfully

  and i go on the hot-metal job he
said hoping it sounded as if he was
pleased

  i know how anxious you are walt
and i dont blame you but thats just
it i can get a hot-metal crane-man but
cant find a second crane-man

  he saw the look come on walts face
but mistook it for disappointment

  if doots was leaving for good walt
it would be different i dont want to
hold up the furnaces now you see how
it is he explained hoping walt would
understand

  walt sighed and tried to keep his
voice even

  well in a case like this i guess i can
wait a little longer

  thats the spirit to show walt mr
bennet said enthusiastically a man
sure of himself dont mind waiting awhile
just between you and me i dont think
doots will come back hes going out to
california and they say its gods coun-
try youll have the job soon i promise
you that

  walt walked out of the office wonder-
ing if it wouldnt have been better to have
been given the job and have it over with
what was going to happen couldnt be any
worse than waiting he was glad when
he was back in the cabin where he could
talk to maggie

  i aint leaving you yet maggie doots
gallegher is going to california and mr
bennet says he might like it so well hed
stay out there but i dont think he will
-honest i dont maggie they have
floods dust-storms and such and they
say its just a lot of lemon-trees without
a steel-mill in sight doots wont like
that maggie you know he wont

harmon tried to
tight llln off walt
swung tlie wrench
-and hannon fell
back senseless
  the hot-metal man who came from
duquesne to take doots place for the
month was a six-footer he was a blond
and looked like a swede or dane walt
had to admit that he had a pair of shoul-
ders walt would have given anything
he had except his love for millie to be
big and strong like the new man was and
go climbing up on the hot-metal crane
with a big sincere grin on his face but
its not strength that does the hot-metal
job well the crane has all the power the
crane-man has to supply the intelligence
eric harmon the duquesne man knew
up from down but walt knew he would
never be given a bonus for the way he
racked in a ladle when he set a ladle
down in the pit he lowered too much and
the cable jerked when he took the slack
in it wasnt so noticeable to the others
who realized the man was working with
the unaccustomed feel of new levers but
walt knew he could run a crane better
than the duquesne man ever would   

  doots gallegher had been gone three
weeks when the letter came mr ben-
net got the news and soon it was being
discussed all over the open hearth
doots had written that he was staying in
california that he had never seen such a
nice country he was going to loaf the
rest of his life and enjoy it he added a
note for walt he said he wished him good
luck and for him to always make sure
the ladle was free of the pits before
racking in mr bennet smiled as he
read the letter to walt then he said
well walt the jobs yours at last
youd better spend an hour or so with
the man coming to take your old job so
hell know the routine good luck
thank you mr bennetf walt said
you said spend an hour or so with the
new man didnt you

  thats all hes a good crane-man
and will learn the ropes quickly after
these six years you dont mind waiting
an hour longer before getting on the hot-
metal crane do you walt

  no sir i guess not walt answered

as he walked across the mill yard and
 into the lower end of the open
hearth the familiar sights and sounds
suddenly seemed strange and far away
he looked toward the upper end where
the hot-metal crane was lowering to pick
up a heat and he thought that he would
be expected to place the next ladle hut
he knew he wouldnt he would follow
out what he had planned when he climbed
the ladder to the hot-metal crane he

hoped he wouldnt lose his nerve he
tried hard not to think of millie for when
he did a lump came in his throat

  the lower-end crew knew about his
getting the new job and were waiting
for him  two men hid behind the furnace
and when he walked by they grabbed
him lifting him by the arms and legs
carrying him between them they walked
to the water-trough and sat him in the
water then they carried him to the
furnace and held him close as the door
was slowly raised steam arose from his
trouser-seat in a cloud the men roared
with laughter walt anthony had been
given a new job and had been given the
open hearth welcome

  with their shouts in his ears walt
slowly climbed the ladder to maggies
cabin he wanted to be alone with her
before the new crane-man came so that
he could bid her good-by

he had just reached the cabin and
was climbing in when he heard the
hoist-cable of the hot-metal crane snap
like a whiplash there was a crash as the
ladle smashed against the pouring plat-
form the scream of the lever-man as the
flames hit him and a hissing roar as the
hundred tons of molten metal splashed
on the pit-level floor walt didnt turn
to see what had happened-he knew with-
out looking he threw the control lever
and had maggie rolling toward the upper
end before he got his feet through the
cabin trap then he looked

  the molten steel had dumped near the
line of ingot-molds the suddenly light-
ened ladle was swinging like a pendulum
flames and smoke were lapping at the
hot-metal crane cabin

  a hundred feet away he felt the burn-
ing heat sear his face he threw the con-
trols on full and rolled with all the speed
maggie had toward the inferno it was
like going in through the opened door of
a blazing furnace the heat hit him lash-
ing at his eyes with a piercing stinging
pain

  the swinging ladle had jammed its
opened maw wedged by the overturned
ingot-molds the remaining hoist-cable
which held it was rigidly taut under the
strain harmon was frantically work-
ing the levers trying to pull free the
cabin of the hot-metal crane was smok-
ing and would soon blaze the insula-
tion was burning soon the flames would
eat through the copper wire and the
crane would short-circuit walt thought
grimly if that happened harmon and he


the blue bc

both would be cooked with the ladle
wedged it would be impossible for mag-
gie to push the hot-metal crane as he had
planned he and maggie could try but
they couldnt lift the ladle and the entire
line of ingot-molds without blowing a
fuse in the power-house

he yelled at harmon to lower away
and rack out so that the ladle would
slide free but his voice couldnt be
heard a foot away above the din and
thereafter he saved his breath so his
lungs wouldnt fill with smoke or flame

  he was over the hot metal now and
going full speed he threw the lever in
reverse and the wheels shrieked as
maggie slid to a stop her beam resting
against the beam of the hot-metal crane

  he saw harmon drop the control-
levers and start crawling out of the
cabin he had lost his head and was
going to jump walt yelled again and
picked up a wrench from the tool-box
he crawled out on maggies beam inch-
ing himself along edgewise trying to keep
the beam between him and the flames
that shot up around him his clothes
smoked and blazed but he made it to the
hot-metal crane cabin harmon was
screaming and tried to fight him off
walt swung the wrench hitting harmon
across the eyes he fell back senseless
into the cabin

  cursing harmon for his large body
which filled most of the space behind
the controls walt crawled in and grabbed
the levers they still had juice in them
he lowered the hoist and racked out
slowly trying to break the ladle from the
ingot-mold grip the cable buckled then
pulled steadily he felt the massive
crane quiver under the strain the ladle
shifted moving the ingot train and
settled back he eased the pull so the
cable wouldnt snap the cabin was
ablaze now his body ached with agoniz-
ing pain another try might do it he
racked in forcing himself to feed the
power slowly so the cable wouldnt
buckle through the flames and smoke
he saw the molten mass of metal surge
over the ingot-molds which had been a
barrier and cut a path toward the pits
number three still held the water from
a recent washing-down of a ladle if the
hot metal reached the pits it would splat-
ter the roof with tons of white-hot lava
both cranes would go dead

  he fed the power steadily until the
ladle tilted then threw the control full
on there wasnt time to take it easy

ik magazine

now either the ladle would wrench free
the cable would break or a fuse blow
the ladle tore loose with a jerk that
swung it against the wall of the melting-
floor like a giant battering ram he
caught it on the back-spin and brought
it to a wavering stop over number three
pit he lowered then hoisted with a
sudden jerk that snapped the hoist-cable
the ladle dropped into the pit its opened
top in the path of the flowing hot metal

  he reached for the lever that moved
the crane lengthwise on its track and felt
it respond to the power that was moving
it from over the grilling heat he felt
the motion and laughed derisively as the
armature blazed angrily and went dead
for he knew the momentum was carrying
them he looked back at maggie a
blazing torch left over the inferno and
thought crazily that he should go back
and push her from over the heat then
he fell limply over the useless controls

  when the crane drifted to a stop at
the upper end they lifted walt anthony
and eric harmon from the cabin both
were unconscious but doctor colcord
said the burns were painful but not
serious walts body had shielded har-
mons but walt should be all right in
a few weeks

two weeks later walt anthony went
back to work as he walked through
the open hearth on the way to the hot-
metal crane he smiled up at maggies
fresh coat of paint and new armatures
and thought what had happened millie
and joe regan and just about the entire
mill crew had come to see him in the hos-
pital it made him embarrassed to hear
them talk so much of how brave he was
and he told them he wasnt brave at all
he told them he had always been afraid
of the hot-metal crane if the ladle hadnt
fallen so quick he hadnt thought what
he was doing he wouldnt have had the
nerve to go up on the crane at all they
all laughed millie bending over and
kissing him and joe regan had said

  thats the way all the hot-metal crane-
men are before they run it the first time
theyre scared to death and are ashamed
to tell anyone after they work the
levers just once theyre all right ive
never seen a one that wasnt just like
walt says he was but of course they
werent as brave as walt

  walt thought maybe joe regan was
right he knew hed never be afraid
again and wondered why he ever had
been

captain l b williams

the advertising business these
days runs into some strange
by-paths a friend of mine
tony lawrence who handles a
lot of advertising problems for a citrus
fruit concern dropped in at the house
one night when captain corbely was
there and started an argument tony
had been working up an entire library
for his company on the subject of citrus
juice being used at sea as a preventive
against scurvy and claimed it had first
been done about 

   youre a couple of centuries off said
capn corbely who had brought over
some books to show me he picked up
one of them the year is  my
friend

  tony waved his hand im not talk-
ing about some chance shot in the dark
all the old seamen were trying to prevent
scurvy and couldnt do it im talking
about the first deliberate use of citrus
juice for that purpose

  so am i said the skipper grimly
and its all in purchas his pilgrimes
for you landlubbers to read only you
spend your time on scientific rot instead
of old sea-captains reports

  tony lawrence got excited about it
and corbely lugged out some of the east

india companys reports and they went
to bat scurvy was one of the great
scourges of the world which according
to tony had been set to rest by science
it had been probably the greatest fac-
tor in sea life in trade and commerce
wiping out ships and entire expeditions
when the period of discovery opened up
distant sea-lanes and voyages lasted for
months and years scurvy got in its mys-
terious work it had to be fought guard-
ed against at huge cost and effort not
until science finally tracked it down and
beat it did the seven seas become a safe
place for mankind

  corbely sniffed at all that science
my eye a seaman beat it long ago a
housewife in woolwich tracked it down
three hundred years before your land-
sharks and doctors did and they didnt
have sense enough to make use of her
wisdom thats all 

we dug into it to learn the truth one
had to get acquainted with the men
of that day with what it meant to go to
sea in that period our present era of
charted seas and scientific precision had
to be swept clear away

  so it was that we came upon the four
men in woolwich   
  of a bitter january night they sat
about a blazing fire in the red rose
tavern and over their sack and mulled
ale discoursed of the death that lay
ahead all four were master seamen
but chief of them was james lancaster
bluff and bronzed with wide blue eyes
set above his short curly beard

lancaster pulled at his long-stemmed
j pipe and listened thoughtfully while
middleton barked away

  ive the dutch charts for you james
aye and linschoten was dead right in
every word he said o winds and tides
but we must figure four months to the
cape and ye all know what that means
lancaster nodded it was the first
voyage of the east india merchants and
he was the general in command and his
high ship the dragon was admiral of the
four in those days a ship and not a
man bore this title

  thats why were taking along the
little guest john before we reach the
cape well refill our water-butts and
our supplies from her and cast her
adrift and our dead men will be re-
placed by her crew aye lad for we
must figure on death

  all four nodded gravely death by sea
and wind and unknown shores death
from shot and ball death from scurvy
-grimmest and surest of all

  tell me something lancaster spoke
out master heyward of theswsaw live
run into you during long voyages and
after em yeve never been took sick
a day when your men were rotten and
you couldnt muster a boats crew you
were always hale and hearty wtiy
lancaster chuckled in his beard my
wife has a remedy against all disorder
or so she thinks its the grace o god
not her sovereign remedy thats kept me
well but im a man o my word as she
knows and she gives me a store of the
stuff and i take it on my promise think
no more of it aye lads its a fearsome
and terrible reflection that when we get
to the cape with its winds and storms
when we need every man on the lines
were certain to have two-thirds of our
crews wi their teeth rotting out and
their bodies swollen and helpless i

  well revictual and refit at saldanha 
bay north o the cape put in william
brand drawing down his shaggy brows

he captained the ascension a dour hard
man but that wont save us from the
scurvy one says one thing about it
another says another every man to his 
own theory and surgeons be damned
eat salt meat as we must and theres
no escaping it well then face it with
a good heart 

  better still find a way to avoid it
lancaster said well have two hun-

middleton barked pour
months to the cape and
ye all know what that
means and tancaster
nodded aye lad    we
must figure on death
illustrated by george avison

dred men aboard the dragon if we
reach the moluccas with a hundred and
fifty well be in luck thats heavy
odds o death lads however well
make it if the dutchmen can were
carrying twenty-seven thousand pounds
in cargo and money and the companys
spending forty-five thousand on the ships
and men weve the best of everything
and by heaven well prove that the fleets
not lacking in the best o men to do the
work well i must home good night
to you all

  he tucked his cloak about him and
stamped home through the snow thought-
ful enough the problem of death still
weighing on his mind much to his re-
lief his good wife was in bed and sleep-
ing so he turned in without waking her

next morning however mistress
lancaster cornered him she was a
plain hearty sensible woman and if she
had a tongue in her head she used it for
loves sake and not for shrewish byplay

  now james where are those bot-
tles

  bottles he repeated blankly he
was checking over a dutchmans pilotage

for the journey home around the cape
what bottles

  for the remedy said she with tart
tongue as you know well out with
ee and fetch me home bottles and
jugs

  lancaster frowned the remedy be
hanged woman now look you  home-
ward bound about the cape if a man
hath no weather for observation he can
safely keep in sixty fathom water while
the ground be shelly but if it be oozy
hell know hes near cape agulhas-
theres a valuable point to note and
you prate of bottles

  aye said she bottles and jugs
im making up enough o the lemon juice
for your whole crew james and ill need
a plenty of containers

he shoved aside his work in dismay
nell theres not a lass in england
whos your equal-but pause a bit in
our ship for such a cruise every bit o
space is precious you can well enough
put up a few bottles o the juice for my
use but for two hundred men-lord
save us all theres no room for it
youll make room she said firmly
if it hadnt been for my remedy youd
be a dead man this day or the life would
be rotted out of you as it is out o many
an old seaman and now you go on an
important voyage wi letters from her
majesty and you general in command
to the far indies and think ye ill see
you go unprepared not i the lem-
ons are bought and ready and ill have
you get the bottles

  its absurd lancaster broke out
why my men wont stand such treat-
ment  ill be the laughing-stock o lon-
don

  youll do what i say james lan-
caster else you dont go to sea-gen-
eral or no general his wife declared
and meant her words scurvy say
most do come from sea air and eating
salt meat i know better ive talked
wi many a seaman and one and all tell
me the same thing the craving for green
stuff for acid tang i the blood youve
said it yourself

  listen my precious lass said lan-
caster earnestly ye know nothing
about it the great men of science the
royal societies the queens own physi-
cians ha looked into this and they be
wiser than you fresh meat they say
will cure it-

  mistress lancaster shook her finger
at him
the blue book magazine

  youll do what i say or another man
goes master o the dragon if i must to
london and see her majesty myself
now is it yes or no

  lancaster suppressed a groan aye
if youre set on it he said sourly

and yell ladle out each man two
spoons per day of a morning-on an
empty stomach your word of honor
he swallowed hard aye if youd
make a fool of me

  better a live fool than a dead lion
my man and you mind it she retorted
i be none o your wiseacre scientists
but i know that when a body craves
something thats what a body needs
and lemon juice hath kept you in health
these many years so to the indies it
goes with you and your word of hon-
or mind 

  aye grunted master lancaster un-
happily but lemons cost good round
money lass and-

  and ive spoke wi sir john hart
yesternight when he was watching the
lading of the ships and got his warrant
for the lemons as part of the expenses of
your ship she broke in so ha done
with your objections

  lancaster got her the bottles but
soon enough he began to hear from the
matter sir john hart one of the asso-
ciated backers of the venture held his
sides when he told about it-and he told
the tale everywhere

  when it first reached lancasters ears
he was arguing with the chief rigger
about the price of a main topsail hold-
ing that twelve pound twelve shillings
was too high not so high as delicacies
like lemons for common seamen said
the other with a grin and they began
to call him lemon lancaster but not
to his face

visitors were coming down from
london in flocks the new company
was sinking its whole subscribed capital
over seventy thousand pounds in this
venture a tremendous sum to gamble on
spice from the moluccas among the
visitors was many a learned man the
physicians talked at length with lan-
caster trying to show him the folly of
this wasteful notion for lemons were
expensive as the devil

  each wise man had a different theory
about the scurvy and a different remedy
the other captains harkened heyward
took aboard a great quantity of fowl
hens blood being a sure remedy accord-
ing to him middleton laded chests of

purgatives brand damned the lot of
them for fools but saw to his salt meat
casks with careful eye and lancaster
stowing the jugs and bottles that his wife
sent down was the butt of many a joke

  the surgeon appointed to the dragon
strove with him earnestly a dour and
opinionated man this surgeon held all
acids in abomination one night he
came to lancasters house and expound-
ed his own theories about the scurvy
claimed he if enough saltpeter were fed
all hands the scurvy would be warded
off since it was but the restrained hu-
mors of the body seeking escape through
the tissues

  stuff and nonsense said mistress
lancaster and the argument waxed hot
in the midst of it in walked martin
hearne who was nephew to the good
lady he bussed her roundly and shook
hands with lancaster who gave him
curt greeting

a dark lean man was hearne with
clever eyes and the name if not the
spirit of a gentleman he was learned in
clerkly things had killed two men in
duels and to lancaster he was a bird of
ill omen as a matter of fact soipe
queer things were said of martin hearne
he had the gift of second sight went
the word not that it brought him any
great luck like all such folk he might
foretell the fate of other men but his
own he could not see

  he listened to the argument with his
thin-lipped twisted smile and then put
in a word or two of his own

  you need not argue the matter for
three reasons he said to the surgeon
the first is master lancaster who lis-
tens to no reason the second is mis-
tress lancaster who will hear no reason
the third my good sir is that youll be
dead of the scurvy yourself within the
six-month

  the surgeon having already perceived
the folly of argument took his leave
hearne smiling turned to lancaster
uncle james ive good news for you
im going on the voyage whats more
im appointed to your own ship the ad-
miral

  you said lancaster god save us
all

  his wife hugged young hearne she
had a leaning to such evil ruffling
blades as most good women have he
explained to them briefly

  aboard each of the ships went a mer-
chant to handle trading and all busi-


we must figure on death

ness of the company sines death was
ever close in such a voyage each mer-
chant had an associate and each asso-
ciate a substitute if two died one
would live to keep the books martin
hearne was third aboard the dragon

  lancaster looking into that dark face
shook his head

  best be frank about it lad said he
wasting no words i like you not nor
you me but god forbid that i do you
a wrong in my heart so come and wel-
come but mind well theres discipline
aboard

  and lemon juice said hearne with
a smile neither one nor the other will
cause me any loss o sleep i promise
you  

  later lancaster frowned at his good
wife when she bade him take care of
hearne

  martins got the makings of a great
man husband said she hes never
been out of england afore now a bit
wild maybe but worth the right guid-
ance

  i doubt it lancaster said bluntly
hes the kind to explode when pent up
on shipboard but for your sake lass
ill be easy with him

    

it was the middle of february when
the ships dropped down the river and
two months more when they left eng-
land  in those days men waited for a
wind and almost before the anchors
were hoysed and stowed lancaster had
trouble on his hands

  his surgeon was stubborn in his re-
fusal to countenance lemon juice little
dreaming that hearnes prediction was
safe enough to come true there were
some aboard glad to adopt his advice
if so they might escape that sour morn-
ing draft on an empty stomach the
ships company had its share of malcon-
tents and trouble-breeders and the scoff-
ing at lemon lancaster had spread
among the crew so the surgeon with
the master gunner and a round score be-
sides flatly refused the lemon juice in
this martin hearne took a leading part

  lancaster had been out to the indies
ere this and knew the vital need of
discipline now he saw it ebbing away
rapidly with hearne egging on the
others as they sailed to the southward
he spoke once and again with the young
man but had no luck

  it was the seventh of may the day
they left the grand canary behind that
he summoned hearne into his cabin

  youre a sullen dog martin said
he being a man of plain speech ive
tried kindness with you and to small
avail youre the one man from whom
id expect full backing but you only pro-
voke trouble daily whats the answer 

hearne regarded him with a thin
bitter smile his dark eyes smolder-
ing wine was in him now as it was often

  ill not lick your boots uncle james
said he nor any other mans boots
youre too high and mighty for my taste
as you know well you can shift me in-
to another ship as you know well also
lancaster frowned at him

  i will not pass on to others a
drunken wastrel and admit i cant han-
dle him not me lad you know the
rules about liquor the next time youre
drunk youll get a dozen lashes

  flog me like one of your seamen
if you do so help me ill kill you
cried hearne im a gentleman  

  im not said lancaster fingering
his brown beard im general of this
fleet lad whats more ive a commis-
sion of martial law from the hands of
her majesty god bless her and ill
have you triced up quicker than any
other man aboard for the simple reason
that youre known to be my nephew
not yours thank heaven  sneered
hearne

  my wife poor lass and lancaster
sighed a little for her sake ive been
patient martin but ill stand little more
of your nonsense youre infecting this
whole crew with discontent youre en-
dangering the venture im warning you
with a kind heart as bidden by holy
writ but some day youll go too far
hearnes thin lip curled

  youre a simple dolt in your way
uncle james said he with contempt
you and your bible reading every day
-ha this venture needs a man of
spirit now look you im none of
your crew to be sodden with your sick-
ly sour juice and doltish notions im
not responsible to you but to the com-
pany ill drink what i damned please
ive said my say martin lancaster
replied calmly god help me im re-
sponsible for every ship and every soul
in this command my wife gave you in-
to my care but four hundred and eighty
other men are in my care and seventy
thousand pounds and the trust of my
friends and my queen dolt  aye im
no very great commander god wot but
i do my best and its only a very wise
man martin or a very simple man like
me who reads holy writ-the one be-
cause he understands it the other be-
cause he needs it and you martin are
neither no more warnings clear out
martin hearne swaggered out with a
twist to his lip james lancaster sat
there with his hands clenched before
him as the ship swayed and the timbers
creaked and his eyes were troubled

it was a week later that hearne drink-
ing ruffling and dicing drew his dirk
and would have killed the chief merchant
but that men fell on him and held him
fast lancaster strode into the cabin
and gave quiet orders-and hearne was
taken out to the deck and spread over
a gun-carriage and was given a dozen
with the cat

  when they had washed the blood off
his back with brine he stood up he
was sobered and he looked lancaster in
the eye as he spoke

  youll mind what i promised if ye
did this

  lancaster said nothing and hearne
went below with a red devil in his eyes

  meantime each morning the lemon
juice was ladled out and those who
would have none of it began to swell in
the joints and move listlessly about the
decks the surgeon worked with them
mightily and talked much with the
master gunner and with hearne and
there was great murmuring against lan-
caster for his iron hand and his grim
discipline but the ships sailed on

 one night there was a crossbow
loosed none knew where or by whom
the bolt missed lancaster by two fin-
gers breadth as he stood on the poop
conning the stars he said nothing of
it but the wind of death had fanned
his cheek closely that night if he
could prove nothing he knew all he
needed to know and was helpless

  the masters mate came to him an-
other night and told of mutterings and
dark words among the men alow and
aloft hearne was in the thick of it
but nothing could be proven against
him many of them feared the man

  hes fey at times said the masters
mate as they talked why sir what
dye think he told me but this morn-
ing he looked at me hard and said
he id die and have honors at my burial
in a far place and the guns of this same
ship would be fired to do me honor and
would kill better men than me sir hes
daft

  daft or not he was dangerous and
in a later day lancaster was to remem-
ber that queer saying when the shotted
guns of the dragon roared over the wa-
tery grave of this same masters mate
and slew master brand and others of his
crew from the ascension in their boat

  fear and terror of martin hearne
spread through the ship he had a
swaggering masterful way with him but
after that one flogging he refrained from
liquor though hatred sat in his eyes
when he looked at lancaster there
began to rise talk of mutiny and what
could be done by lusty men if they took
the ship and set out to seek plunder it
came to lancasters ears and he knew
hearne was behind it and he was help-
less

  night after night he sat in his cabin
the weather being good and conned the
big bible with its heavy black type
night after night he lay in his berth
or knelt beside it if the seas were not
strong and wrestled in prayer for guid-
ance from aloft he was a simple man
with a strange simple faith and simple
iron will the sort of man to do great
things and do them quietly or do terrible
things and do them sternly or do little
things and do them nobly but liere
he did not know what to do hearne
was too clever for him would give him
no handle and that was the truth of it

take care of the lad mistress lan-
caster had said little did hearne
need any care-taking it was not this
that troubled james lancaster one whit
but he realized that first his life was
in danger night and day from this man
and much depended on his life fur-
ther and more important to his mind
the entire voyage was in danger

  here was a festering sore rapidly in-
fecting the whole ship this one shrewd
and unscrupulous man menaced every-
thing talk of mutiny and piracy of
gold and riches and women was enough
to set all hands stark mad and backed
up by hearne by the master gunner by
the dour surgeon it would lead to wreck-
age unless checked how to check it

  lancaster helpless sought higher
help and knew not that it was already
within his heart and soul for like
many another man he sought the voice
of god from the tempest and the earth-
quake  and recognized the still small
sound only after it had come   

  on the twentieth of june the ships
boy came to him whimpering with a


the men of the dragon hale and hearty stared amazedly at the men of the
other ships the scurvy had laid hold upon them all



queer story of voices heard that evening
on the stern walk-a gallery above the
rudder around the square stern the
boy was scared stiff mens voices he
said talking of mutiny and powder and
killing in cold blood he knew nothing
definite but he told enough to send a
cold chill through lancasters very soul
so it had come to crisis and not a
shadow of excuse to clap hearne into
irons-even if that would do any good
which was doubtful

  that night lancaster read in his bible
with agony of soul and knelt in prayer
for the ship was on a steady keel two
degrees north of the line with calms

x-
the blue book magazine

and much contrary wind and all the
ships keeping well in company

  he fell asleep at last-and wakened
to shouts and trampling feet horror
seized on him he reached for sword
and pistols mutiny then the sun
was up and he broke for the deck hur-
riedly

  no mutiny instead a great proud
portugal bellying out of the north a
carrack deep-laden for the indies alert
and joyous lancaster sent his roar along
the deck ordered out signal for the
other ships to follow and sent the
dragon booming along with every scrap
of sail set to the steady light air

  the other ships fell behind the
morning waxed and heatened to noon
over a glassy sea with hardly even a
ground-swell and still the dragon leaned
to the spread of canvas mile by mile
she crept up on that big portugal until
by noon the carrack was desperately
and frantically loosing the cannon from
her high stern to no avail

 lancaster bore on his men were
armed and ready sink her not he
by heaven she was deep-laden and a
prize worth the having he paced the
poop deck in his gleaming steel cap
and breastplate his men had matches
alight he had his pistols ready muskets
and crossbows and swords as the two
ships crept closer until a spattering fire
broke out and the grapnels were poised
for flinging

  and there was hearne in steel cap
and breastplate likewise the first man
over her rail as the ships staggered and
crashed and swung-the first man after
lancaster himself a quick brief break-
ing of battle there and the portugal
fled for it and hearne after them into
the cabins with a wild yell on his lips

  and after hearne james lancaster

he cgme on the man in the big after-
cabin came upon him striking down
a poor devil and stripping him of jeweled
gauds beyond a swinging door was an
empty cabin lancaster came up to
hearne mindful of a pistol-ball that had
glinted off his breastplate a moment
earlier and hearne swung around his
dark lean face aglow with devils light

  so it was your pistol martin said
lancaster and it failed as your cross-
bow failed

  hearne gripped at his empty pistol
and cursed hotly lancaster his own
pistol cocked and ready nodded at the
empty cabin

    id have a word with you-in there
  said he his eyes were wide and cold as
  ice but very steady

    have it here damn you said hearne
  in there i said what -and lan-
  caster laughed with no mirth at all
  you and your precious mutiny-youd
  not talk it over with me man what
  if id be willing to join you and navi-
  gate the ship-eh

    you youd join-plague take you
  hearnes eyes widened for an instant
  then he smiled his twisted smile join
  us eh  no chance of that trying one
  of your tricks on me eh

    lancaster nodded but his eyes were
  more than ever like ice

    aye lad and it worked ive heard
  enough in there for a private word in
  your ear-quick about it 

    the sharp command the knife-edge of
  the voice sent hearne into the cabin
  after him went in lancaster and closed
  the door

  the portugal was taken and not a
  man lost in the taking despite all the
  shooting and conflict or so it was
  thought indeed but when the other
  three ships came up and their crews came
  swarming aboard to join in the looting
  sad word arose and was brought to
  james lancaster as he stood in the late
  afternoon sunlight directing the work

    in a cabin had been found martin
  hearne with a pistol-ball between his
  eyes and below with a sword-stroke
  through his heart the master gunner
  was dead hearing this lancaster
  nodded

     it is the will of god said he in his
  quiet way

    the matter was passed over as of
  small account before greater things the
  lading of the carrack was easily shipped
  out and divided in that quiet sea but
  here was something else the men of
  the dragon were hale and hearty for
  the most part and finding themselves
  suddenly cheek to jowl with men from
  the other three ships stared amazedly
  for those men were pallid and like lead
  in color and moved heavily and were
  broken out with sores and swellings the
  scurvy had laid hold upon them all

    and not upon us said lancaster
  when he heard about it well then
  lets give thanks to god where it be-
  longs

    and not forget the lemon juice said
  some one bluff middleton of the hec-
  tor let out a snort and a scoffing laugh


we must figure on death

   nonsense its but a touch that
 comes wi the salt meat ive got it well
 in hand with medicines when we touch
 at saldanha bay yell see my crew sound
 and hearty but you and your lemon
 juice james-all he shook his head
 sagely ye know well that it comes
 quickly to some ships slow to others
 and when it comes its with a rush i
 feel sorry for your poor men james
 lancaster

   theyll come through said lancas-
 ter middleton gave him a sharp look

   whats wrong with you  by god
 heres a fat prize hardly a man lost
 weather good-and damme if you aint
 got the look of a man in torment
 whats wrong

   nothings wrong john and lan-
 caster smiled the deep strong gravity
 of his eyes was returning slowly it was
 true his face had worn a queer haunted
 look-but his smile banished it

no nothings wrong he went on
and glanced about at least nothings
 wrong with my ship better look to
 your own for i dont like the faces of
your men by half

   middleton clapped him on the shoul-
 der and laughed jovially

   when they had shared everything out
 of the portuguese ship they let her go
 her ways and the wind shot them down
 across the line

   here they took all the victuals out of
 the little guest stripped her clean di-
 vided her men among the four tall ships
 took her spars and broke her upper
 works asunder for firewood and cast
 her adrift

 on into july and through august ever
 to the south and eastward with the
 winds fair enough on the whole and as
 the four ships drove lancaster made
 out queer things aboard the other three
 staggering skeleton men about the decks
 the merchants taking turns at the helm
 or up aloft and fewer and fewer persons
 in sight at all aboard the dragon how-
 ever all was well enough and there was
 no more muttering or discontent

   it was the ninth of september when
 they raised saldanha bay lancaster
 came first into the bight and cast an-
 chor the other three ships were stand-
 ing in but as he watched them come and
 saw how they handled his face whitened

   out wi the boats he ordered all
 hands and god preserve us all this
 day for well have need of it

  a true word and a bitter one

  the three ships came staggering in
aboard each of them nothing moved a
few poor feeble things crawled about the
anchors and managed to let go that was
all not a boat was hoisted out not a
sail was taken in not a line touched
when lancaster stepped aboard the vice-
admiral it was like a ship of the dead
sodden things lay about the decks rot-
ting shapes crawled and moaned bluff
middleton was himself like a scarecrow
swollen dying creatures every one of
them and so with the other two ships
as well-down to the last man

  a hundred and five died there and the
others were little better until rest and
proper diet set them afoot again but
not in james lancasters ship

and that said captain corbely as
he thumbed over his books and
drew down his brows at us is all of the
yarn to the point lancaster went on to
success and knighthood-

  but hang it wait broke in tony
lawrence excitedly why if that yarn
is true capn the greatest scourge of the
sea was licked right there then why
wasnt it made public why wasnt it
known 

  corbely gave me a wink

  they didnt have radio back in those
days thats why and no joke about it
either thats a fact lancaster knew
sure enough what hed discovered but
people laughed at him all the same it
wasnt followed up

  why gasped lawrence its an
amazing story  its magnificent

  so it is said capn corbely but i
dont mean what you mean i mean this
seaman lancaster who could do things
the way he did he went on-he walked
with kings as the poet feller said but
the big thing in this yarn to my mind
is how he made everything right aboard
that ship of his

  oh nonsense tony lawrence put
in thats all right sure but good
lord man the big thing is in the dis-
covery about citrus juice-

  thats because you work for citrus
juice said captain corbely gravely
and im a master in sail like james
lancaster maybe after all thats why
he didnt think the lemon-juice business
very important he probably remem-
bered what one of them bible chaps said
about putting first things first

  but tony failed to get the point

another notable story in this ships and men series will appear in our next issue

an old-guard blue book writer comes back to
us with this brief but vivid drama of a g-man
on the job

by william byron
mowery

from his seat in the grandstand
mcnain watched the pack streak-
ing down the home stretch the red-
jacketed dog a rod ahead was loping
in to an easy win

  number three dog the agent mut-
tered to himself belger always plays
number three on the nose the chief
says i suppose i ought to go and watch
the pay-off again-about my only chance
to spot him

  without waiting for the finish of the
race mcnain sought the nearest stair-
head and walked down the cement corri-
dor to the gallery close to the pay-off
window he struck up a casual chat with
a popcorn-vendor

  a few minutes later the people who
held tickets on number three came
streaming in to collect mcnain scruti-
nized them sharply with a hand on the
cold automatic in his pocket belger-to
give him the best known of his aliases-
had already shot his way out of two ar-
rests back east the chair was wait-
ing for the mobster the methodical
chief had gathered court-sure evidence
of half a dozen killings against smoky
belger

  there were perhaps thirty people in the
pay-off line one by one mcnain looked
them over very carefully identifying
smoky belger would not be easy in a
grandstand crowd or a tourist-jammed
city it would be next to impossible since
his flight from the big town belger un-
doubtedly had had his face worked on
and had made other alterations in him-
self but in a small handful of people
like this pay-off line a man stood a
chance of spotting him by elimination or
otherwise

  the line gradually dwindled merged
with the gallery crowd and vanished no

austin briggs

belger-nor anyone faintly resembling
the killer

  hell mcnain growled weary with
repeated failure hes here all right
the chief wired me hes in this city and
the chief dont make mistakes smokys
always been a fool about dogs hes
right here in this dog crowd tonight-and
i cant nail him

  hardly knowing just what to dotvic-
nain wandered back to the grandstand
thoughtfully his gray observant eyes
strayed over the tiers of people the bril-
liantly lighted track the oval lake in the
center the jockeys parading the next
batch of dogs to the starting cages

  four nights in a row he mused and
not the slightest progress in nailing
smoky belger some of these days the
killer would be moving on and his trail
would be lost completely

  he wondered why belger according to
authentic data always bet on number
three dog some silly hunch or supersti-
tion probably mobsters were like that

  anyhow mcnain tried to console him-
self dutch ebward the big shot of the
racket had been safely stowed away for
life by the chiefs coldly scientific cam-
paign and lefty dill faced with the
same reckoning had taken a jump
through a fourteenth-story window
they had been the real brains of the mob
and they had been put out

but this thought somehow did not
console agent mcnain he had been
dispatched south on belgers trail and
had failed to get the man to know that
belger was in this town and probably in
this very dog crowd and yet to fail so
flatly at nailing the killer-it was an
exasperating spot

  his mind kept running on the enigma
of why smoky belger always bet on
number three dog even if the habit
did spring from mere superstition the
explanation might throw some light on
belgers thought-processes and give a
pqfson a lead to work on

  across the oval lake the electric hare
started around the track idly mcnain
picked up a trampled program glanced
at it at the records of the entries num-
ber one dog had by far the best showing
and on the board he was a heavy favorite

  an idea sprang into mcnains mind
ive got it he exulted ive got it
my watch against a shirt-button i know
why belger bets the way he does

  ordinarily mcnain took little interest
in these dull cut-and-dried races but
this one he watched closely when the
hare flashed past the cages number one
dog was away to a two-length lead
steadily it dropped the main pack behind
at the north end of the track it was yards
ahead of the place dog running easily
with the effortless grace of a bird in
flight it was a sure winner

  again mcnain left the grandstand and
hurried down to the number one win-
dow the hand on his automatic trem-
bled a little and he slipped the trigger
safety of the weapon ready for business

  through the gallery resounded the
loud-speaker announcement that number
one dog had made a new track record
presently the pay-off crowd came troop-
ing in mcnain looked them over

  his gaze lighted upon a dapper black-
haired individual near the end of the line

a thrill went through him like an electric
shock he was not dead positive of his
identification but that hair looked un-
naturally black and the mans spectacles
had flat lenses-flat as window glass

  he walked up and touched the man on
the shoulder

  hello smoky he said pleasantly

  in the next split-second his last doubts
about the mans identity vanished with
a snarl the man whipped out a blue auto-
matic

  there was nothing else to do-mcnain
pumped three slugs into him the man
slumped to the floor his gun clattering
on the cement

at the hospital the next day mcnain
- brushed past the policeman on guard
at the door and entered the neat white
room

  sorry i had to cut you down smoky
he said but you asked for it and the
doctors say anyhow that youll live to
go back north with me so alls well
that ends well

  the man in bed glared at him how
the hell did you know i was in that line 
simple mcnain informed pride
goeth before destruction let me explain
you to yourself you always used to bet
on number three dog didnt you that
was because you stood third in the mob
wasnt it

  belger refused to answer and mcnain
went on confidently then dutch eb-
ward and lefty dill got put away and
that left you number one man so i
figured youd switch to number one dog
it was just a hunch but i played it on
the nose-and here we are

sheriff hoag fat genial sym-
pathetic could not help noticing
i how big tom rexas eyes burned
when he talked about that wolf
they burned with a wilder fire when he
told of the giant bone he had brought
from the desert mountains of sinaloa

  horse hoag of course wanted facts
there was the body of cal carter in the
next room of the office shack and there
was a cfowd in the street that wanted
to know how carter was killed facts
-not love and hate and fear-were de-
manded  and hoag was not sure that he
was getting them the one man who
knew everything tom rexas was pretty
well shaken up and his talk was ranting
but when two men go into the desert
and one comes back dead and telling no
tales whats to be done except listen to
the other 

  tom rexas sat by the pot-bellied
stove tense gaunted a glare to his eyes
-the result perhaps of those last days of
being trapped and living in perpetual
fear at least that is what one person
in the town believed when she looked
into those eyes

  nell leroyd came to the sheriffs office
with a glass of hot water and whisky
which tom needed badly she was a
slim tanned clear-eyed girl who made
everyone else in the big office shack look
old

  in that crowded roomful nell was the
one who was most vitally interested in
what had happened for she was to have
married cal carter as soon as he got
back from the desert and he had been
brought back-all that was left of him

  he lay on a bench in the little lean-
to room adjacent to the office everyone
watched her go back there and sit alone
with him the lamplight glowing on her
lovers dead face sheriff hoag had a
lump somewhere under his double chin
as he closed the door between that room
and the front office she reminded him
of his daughter who at twenty had be-
come a widow after a paiute raid

  a group of the towns leading citizens
-the veterinarian doc pickens an old
assayer called the prof a few of the
bigger cow bosses-sat in the room to
listen to what was technically a coro-
ners inquest in chloride as in many
western towns the coroner and the
sheriff were one

  in the search for facts horse hoag
found a good starting-point in the veter-
inarians announcement cal carter had
been shot the slug hitting him across the
body entering at the solar plexus and
flattening against the pelvic bone at his
left hip obviously a shot like that
could not be suicide and there was one
more fact the slug fitted a  which
the sheriff had right there on his desk tn
front of everyone

everyone watched tall tom rexas
through pipe-smoke they watched
hard and listened hard the old assayer
who was a soft-voiced gentle fellow and
certainly the wisest man in town said
tell us this tom did you go down to
the border to hunt for that borax de-
posit youd heard about

  i went to find cal carter tom said
excitedly i promised nell id find
him you all knew that before i packed
out

  but youd heard of the deposit and
knew about where it was

  sure thats why i knew where to
hunt for cal

  one of the old ranchers who had come
in after the inquest began asked was
cal carter already beefed when you
found him

  no ive told the rest of these men
he was trapped in a box canon hed
fallen down a sand wash-out and lost
his gun and kept sliding

  where was this at 

  i cant tell for certain id trailed
his burros prints through a lot of gulches
and badland cracks till i was plumb lost
i only know that i got home by the
nrr of mexico at that little junction
   e author of
three were thor-
oughbreds and
piping the devil
here gives us a very
unusual and special-
ly interesting story

called rincon the canon might have
been in chihuahua or maybe sinaloa
didnt you ask the mexes who helped
you bring cal to the railroad

  they were yaquis bronco yaquis
who couldnt savvy what i was talking
about besides cal was dying what
did i care about where we were except
to get him back home i got on a
freight train with cal and the bone-
the what several men asked

  the horse doctor got up that re-
minds me tom wanted me to have a
look at that bone

  tom rexas eyes had flared as if sud-
denly heated by the drink he was sipping
the sheriff had seen the bone out there in
the corral behind the loading-platform
it was not packed as field men pack a
valuable specimen with wood splints

and flour paste but wrapped in gunny-
sacks and tossed there as if forgotten

sheriff hoag returned to the subject
at hand if cal carter fell down a
sand-chute into a canon why couldnt
he get out where the canon opened at
the other end even a box canon has
an opening somewheres

there was a swamp at the open end
rexas said i saw cal waving to me
and i took a pasear around the rim to
see what was wrong i couldnt figure
why the swamp stopped him so i just
slid down the sand wash it was a long
slide past one stratum after the other
each one as clear as the grand canon
you slid down a million years the
old prof remarked being an assayer
he was also somewhat of a geologist

i had to climb down the rest of the
way and the whole lay-out of rocks
changed with each outcrop and the air
grew lots hotter thats like the grand
canon too the lower you get the
mesquite gave way to palms then to
tree ferns the bottoms were like one
of these pictures the oil-companies get
out in their ads pictures of the world
before the flood the glaciers never
got down that far to change the scenery

he was a pretty fierce
wolf-a bad one but i
sort of leaned on bun
for nerve the wolf and
i needed each other

and i had the hunch nothing else had
ever changed it either the nearest ive
ever seen to that kind of lay-out is back
in louisiana what with all the swamp
palmettoes and spanish moss so it looks
like another age but this was different
hot as hell with the blower off so hot
your head knocked like a kettle and
yet cal had a fire going a regular barbe-
cue-fire i couldnt savvy it

  the sheriff scratched the stubble on
one of his chins whats wrong with
a barbecue

  tom rexas seemed to find the answer
a hard one well he didnt have any
hunks of meat to be cooking for one
thing all he had was mesquite beans
and bread and sheep sorrel for seasoning
thats what we had for supper when i
got down there

  youre getting off the main trail
son the old prof said why didnt
you and carter pack out what was
the trouble with the swamp

  well we could have crossed it by
wading through a lot of mud washes and

over floating turf and rotten logs but
we wanted to make sure of it before we
tried it we had enough to eat-tule
roots and swamp potatoes and such-
everything but meat we wanted a hunk
of meat bad but there wasnt any a
mule-deer fell into the gulch the next
day but we never saw it again some
sage rabbits fell in and wild cattle-
all in one day

  im talking of many days they fell
in and we never saw hide nor hair of
them it got us thinking

  the assayer was thinking too ahead
of everyone else youre leading up to
why you were afraid of the swamp
crocodiles maybe it being a mexican
jungle

  no i never saw a crocodile there
didnt see anything alive everything
that got down there was killed right
off but i did kind of expect to see-
he wiped his forehead distractedly
well you start getting funny hunches
when your heads throbbing with the
heat and you know youre trapped


    what kind of hunches sheriff hoag
 asked bluntly

    those animals that had fallen into
 the canon-i had a hunch that something
 was catching them

   is that why you found cal carter
 keeping fires going in daytime was it
 for cooking or for keeping off this thing
 you figured was eating the animals
 carter didnt admit that and i
 didnt make him admit it we just
 kept staring at each other you see we
 hadnt any proof that is not until-
 he kneaded his hands and his eyes
 slid towarcf the closed door of the leanto

   i found a footprint down near the
 swamp it was when i was getting some
 wattles to build an adobe hut the
 trees grew in a creek that was dry so
 you could see a print in the sand it
 was a big print

   how big

    rexas measured with his hands like a
 fisherman who first estimates his listen-
 ers credulity i had nothing to measure
 it with anyway i thought it was only
  the print of a fossil stuck for a million
 years in the sandstone

   thought you said sand

    rexas looked cornered for a moment
 i wis pretty jumpy at the time i didnt
 get it clear that it was sand till the next
 day then i asked myself how could
 that fossil print be in the sand when it
 was plenty clear the creek had been
 running with water a few months ago

 horse hoag and his deputies smiled
 with the sides of their mouths this
 young rannihan must have been in a
 pretty bad way of course he was no
 scientist interested in fossils but he was
 a prospector and any man hunting col-
 ors would stop at the sight of a fossil
 print and measure it and determine the
 nature of the matrix

   when you told carter whatd he
 do hoag asked

    i didnt tell him

   what they all gasped

   poor cal was just about gone by
 then-i mean up here he pointed to
 his forehead i never saw fear crumble
 a man so adobe crumbling bit by bit
 hour by hour-thats what i saw happen
 to a man when i had this first real
 proof i knew if i gave it to him it
 would finish him then i found out that
 carter had seen that print himself i
 knew it by his eyes-they bulged like a
 wild broncs he had the shakes-and
 theyre awful to see unless you know

its just rotgut and the bum deserves
them he said it wasnt fair that he had
to go around without a gun when i al-
ways had mine belted on he begged
me to let him tote it at least when he
went for firewood i said id get the
firewood and he could stick close to me
i wasnt going to lend him that gun
hed go shooting up every tree-stump or
shadow in the canon and maybe shoot
himself    shooting yourself is better
han just waiting night after night for
something to come and eat you

  the roomful of listeners shoved their
cuds from one side of their cheeks to the
other the sheriff said thoughtfully
funny you didnt tell us the first thing
you got to town what youd seen

  i didnt see it tom cried the
canon was so deep the sun only got in
there at noon and there was that swamp
where the thing could live without ever
coming out the fires kept it back
there i was plumb sure of that

  and you two coots just denned up in
one side of the canon choosing to stay
there indefinite instead of risking the
swamp hoag grunted incredulously

  we didnt just den up tom almost
shouted we had it all fixed to pack
out any minute we made wicker -bas-
kets for grub and a bark bag to hold
water i went down to the swamp alone
to see if there was a good way to cross
but i saw the pepper-grass bordering
the swamp all squashed in a long trail
where something had crawled over it
i can read sign well enough the bent
grass made a shallow trough about four
feet wide leading out of the swamp and
back again the grass-blades were mov-
ing up back into place while i looked
and maybe you know what that meant 
horse hoag used to tracking bad
men said readily something had just
passed there a few minutes before

  the assayer suggested an alligator
trail maybe as they call em back in
louisiana 


  those are water trails tom rexas
objected this thing had come up on
dry land besides the track was too
big for an alligator he caught the
sheriffs eyes sun-squinted and tiny in
fat then he glanced to the assayer next
to him the profs eyes were enormous
behind strong dusty lenses but cold as
marble you dont believe me do
you not a man of you

  they chewed the sheriff said dryly
do you believe it yourself

  the result of this question was as-
tonishing tom actually looked stumped
i know i believed it when we spent
those hours waiting and planning and
plotting how to cross that swamp with-
out that thing catching us it worked
on me like it had worked on cal i
kept wondering day and night what it
would look like i kept figuring mak-
ing a picture of it in my mind once
when i went near the swamp-that was
at noon but i had a torch in each hand
-i saw a vine and some club roots at the
end the rains had flooded the swamp
so that things were moving i thought
it was a long neck with a horses head
i was sure of it 

the old profs eyes narrowed all of
a sudden turning smart by grab
im beginning to understand over his
silver rims he looked at tom steadily
listen tom did you really see it or
make up something in your head you
said you were dreaming what it would
be like-asleep or awake you were
dreaming

  tom made a helpless gesture with
his arms i dont know i dont know
if i saw it then or not but i did know
that if we tried that swamp wed never
get across it was when i figured that
out for certain that i decided to trap the
thing

 you-what

  i told cal to stay in a crevice of rock
and hole up there with fires outside till
i got back then i picked out a spot
nearer the swamp and lit a lot of big
bonfires which gave me time to build
the trap not much of a trap just a big
boulder that i loosened by digging for
days around the bottom rocks that
pinned it on an outcrop of the gulch
wall a perched boulder way up high
i wouldnt have thought of this kind of
a trap except that a wolf fell into the
gulch

  thought they all got caught and et
up horse hoag objected

  but this one ran into the arroyo
where we had our regular fires we had
denned up the way beavers do you
cant get to their house without passing
under water first our barrier was fire
the wolf should have been afraid of the
fire and of us too but he was more
afraid of that other thing he came like
a dog and skulked at my heels and
looked through my legs down into the
gulch bed i took him in as a pet i
wanted some meat some broiled chops
but i wouldnt have touched that wolf
it shows you how fear will ride a man
it was like finding a long-lost brother-
one that you love and he was a pretty
fierce wolf at that he was a bad one

he pulled aside his bandana to show
his throat

  see these scars he was a killer
that wolf scrawny and blood-hungry
but scared-so scared he never made a
sound or a snarl never even gave a
moon-howl i fed him pikimi bread
but he got tired of it he wanted meat
he got after me

  he readjusted his bandana the room-
ful of hard-headed old men was for the
first time impressed

  i knocked him out with the bu of
my gun but i didnt finish him i
wasnt going to eat him i just couldnt
eat him he was too much like a dog
and i love dogs so i let him come to
and i fixed up my wounds with rock
salt and maguey sap i even fixed up
the wolf where the gun-butt had cut his
head

  id have salted him hoag observed
yes but i wanted him just as he
wanted me because we were both
scared to death-dont you see that
cal carter gibbering all the time was no
good to me i wanted something healthy
the more bronco that wolf was the
more i liked him and sort of leaned on
him for nerve get what i mean the
wolf and i needed each other

  id have curled him up but go on
my wounds didnt heal i was pretty
sick but i forgave the old lobo let
bygones be bygones was my way of
looking at it but he was still hungry
for something besides mesquite beans
he got after me again i had to tie him
up with a rope

  pretty square way to treat a lobo
whered you get the rope

  lots of fiber and vines thats what

i	used for the trap but i didnt decide
to use it till the wolf jumped me a third
he was hungry fop
something besides mes-
qulte beans he wanted
meat he got after me

time sorry old hoppergrass but three
strikes is out i said i talked to him
like im talking to you so i killed him
goodi his listeners nodded he
killed the wolf hunkydory i 

  i fixed him as bait so the rope would
pull the last brace away from the teeter-
ing rock then i let the fires go out
the next day at noon i went there with
my torches there were a lot of buz-
zards in the sky the wolf was still
there but something had tried to snatch
him because the trap was sprung the
boulder had tumbled down but the
thing it hit had got away wriggled off
perhaps like a snake thats cut in half

i	could see grass crushed everywhere
and big chunks of adobe broken loose
where it had lashed up and down it
had got back to the swamp and the
mud channels down there i knew it
was dead because more and more buz-
zards kept wheeling down

  if the buzzards saw it then of course
you saw what they were after the sher-
iff said what did it look like

  it was a long time before i found it
there was so much ooze down there and
the carcass must have been pretty well

  covered up it was too dark for me to
see anything of course i didnt dare
trail too near the swamp except at high
noon and with a torch how did i
know but that there were other things
there like the one id trapped

 how did you know the one youd
trapped was there the old prof said

  i went back to cal carter and our
hide-out the rains started again days
and days of them bad rains that put
out our fires and that was the last
straw for cal carter im not saying it
wasnt the last straw for me too liv-
ing there with a madman didnt help
my nerves much when some one else
has daft pictures twisting his brains
your brains get to doing the same thing
how do i know what was really happen-
ing in that canon how can i give any
proof im just telling you we were
both daft when those rains kept pouring
and we sitting in that hole waiting for
the sun with the fires out we didnt
have a hope left in our hides it was
then that cal got my gun

  brown lips began to wrinkle stretch
furtively the eyes of the listeners sidled
to each other but rexas went on fast


  it was easy enough for cal to frisk
me we slept close to each other shoul-
der to shoulder and we didnt sleep
quiet either first one of us then the
other would squirm roll maybe sit up
maybe get up to look out into the black
rain cal couldve slipped around on
the other side of me where i wore my
gun without me waking since i knew
my trap had worked i was getting a
little sleep without waking up at every
stir but cal didnt believe about the
trap he couldnt and i couldnt make
him understand he stuck to the one
straight idea that something was com-
ing to eat him up course i woke up
right away when he started slipping my
gun out then it happened hed heard
something crawling out there in the rain
maybe anyway he was crazy wild he
shot himself

the roomful of gnarled burned men
was silent and grim but they kept
their gaze focused on tom rexas face

  youve thought up a good way to ex-
plain how cal carter happened to be cut
down by your gun horse hoag said
but you forgot one thing a man dont
commit suicide by shooting himself in
the solar plexus maybe a jap would
do it that way-with a knife but cal
carter wasnt a jap it dont add up
i dont know how it happened
tom cried helplessly i only know i
was fighting with him when i woke up
i was trying to get back my gun i
know cal was howling that the thing
was out there crawling in the sludge-
listen tom the sheriff said
there aint a man in this room will be-
lieve that gauzy yarn if you just talked
of a wolf all right we know wolves

there was that swamp
where the thing could live
without ever coming out

the fires kept it back there

i was plumb sure of that

but making up this critter that all of us
know dont exist-

  how do you know it dont exist
tom shot back theyve found giant
lizards off in the dutch east indies
somewhere just a few years ago and
theyve brought some of em to the big
zoos back east-lizards that kill horses
komodo dragons something like that
they call em

  the prof seeing everyone turn in-
tuitively for his comment at this point
nodded cant deny it ive read up
about a critter they got in new zealand
a living fossil they call it left-over
you might say from eocene times you
gents know enough about prospecting to
know what eocene means well its
long ago long before the utah indians
before any indians way back in the
age of reptiles we got some of em
right today look at our ornery little
gila monster maybe tom saw a good
hefty gila monster and then again he
said sticking to a previous inspiration
maybe he didnt see nary a thing
hes admitted that much horse
hoag said facing tom down you
trapped the thing and even then you ad-
mit you didnt see it
the trap sprung then i kind of woke
up as if id been having a nightmare i
wasnt afraid of that swamp any more
i packed cal across we were free

  you reckon you could have crossed
any time the prof asked shrewdly

  tom did not answer sensing the cold
stares the incredulity of everyone in the
room he hurried to the end i got some
burros from a yaqui village and i fig-
ured i might get cal back to nell le-
royd before he died he seemed to be
getting better enough to understand my
talk but he wouldnt believe id trapped

  once again rexas looked cornered
i just didnt have time to comb the
whole swamp i had to take care of cal
and fix his wound he wanted to die
but i doctored him and sat up with him
and nursed him i told him about nell
leroyd waiting for him but it didnt
help he wanted to die it didnt even
help when i told him there was nothing
more to fear he was afraid to live
afraid even when i told him id found a
iant skeleton down in the boulder-wash
y the swamp the bones all picked clean
by buzzards

  you told him that just making it up
to quiet him the prof asked still mull-
ing over his private explanation

 no it was-toms voice turned
vague-it was there i really saw the
skeleton and i got one of the bones
that the giant boulder cracked when

the critter he said he wouldnt move
from his bunk till i proved id trapped
the thing and showed him the skeleton
-leastwise part of it you see he still
figured he was in our hole and the rains
were pouring i thought if i could get
him fixed up in his mind he might want
to get well and get back to nell leroyd
so i took a burro and crossed the swamp
again and got the bone so as to give him
proof it helped him a lot he wanted
to live now and get back home but it
was too late he died on the train just
yesterday like you all know

  and thats your whole statement
sheriff hoag said he looked at his
deputies and the old ranchers in the
room some of them shook their heads
which meant that the statement could
not be accepted others when the sher-
iff touched the handcuffs on his belt
the blue book magazine

nodded slowly and this meant the same
thing tom rexas whole story was a
hoax hence the handcuffs were in order
for if a man cooked up a hoax like this
it meant he must have a reason hence
he was guilty

  if thats all tom then i may as well
ask this jury to turn in a verdict but
first id like to have a little say on my
own horse hoag cleared his throat
then sucked at the sludge in his pipe-
bowl we all know tom that youve
been pretty sweet on nell leroyd since
you were both kids and nell wasnt
very sure just which one she wanted you
or carter she chooses carter-why it
dont matter to this case except i under-
stand you had a tiff with her and she
objected to your gambling and helling
around but that aint here nor there
heres what counts you and carter
heard from some desert rat about a rich
deposit of borax down across the border
carter goes first hoping to get some real
money to get married on you follow
him down you dont tellus exactly
where you went-which maybe you got a
reason i aint saying right out the
reason might be borax and a claim you

umped but i am saying this you
iring carter back like you promised the
girl only hes plugged and with your
gun if youd told us youd found him
already plugged and dying and that
youd helped him to the train we might
believe you but you tell us something
which clear enough is made up out of
your own head you let your story-tell-
ing spread too wide a loop in plain
terms tom it looks to me and i know
it looks to the rest of these men here
that i got to hold you for the murder of
cal carter

  tom rexas eyes were pale and star-
ing he gave a slight groggy jerk as if
he had been hit on the chin i dont
know what you mean murder- i-
then you dont believe a word 

  he looked at every face and got the
same answer a fixed rugged squint of
accusation horse hoag said it dont
look like any man in this room or in
this whole town will ever be horn-
swoggled by a story like that no ones
ever going to believe you

from the door of that back room
came a voice i believe himi

  they all turned to see the straight
slim figure of nell leroyd tom rex-
as kept his promise she said he
went down there to the desert to find

cal if he hadnt kept that promise
you wouldnt have any case against him
-not a grinning sheep-headed one of
you if he was guilty hed have left
cals body there for the coyotes and
what could you have done about that
sheriff what sort of a trial would you
have with the corpus delicti down in
some lost canon in mexico instead
tom brought cal carter back as he
promised me and he brought back the
gun cal shot himself with at least he
would have thrown that away

  but this yarn of his horse hoag
persisted its enough to prove him
guilty right there whats he hiding
what really happened  he aint told us
his yarn proves it hes talked himself
right into the rope

ait a minute now the prof put
in professor ringo was pretty
well read in geology somewhere in his
unknown past he had picked up an edu-
cation as everyone knew many pros-
pectors came to him to have their dreams
substantiated-or else forever broken
he knew what the desert did to mens
hopes-and to their brains i got some-
thing to say which might give you gents
a little different slant on what happened
to tom

  you mean you of all men will let
yourself be sagebrushed by a prospectors
yarns horse hoag exclaimed

  not a bit i dont believe a word
tom said about that giant critter down
yonder but that dont prove hes a liar
theres been leftovers from the pliocene
as the books call it maybe even from
the upper cretaceous although thats
too hard to swallow as tom himself
told us weve found animals just like
the critters of the reptile age maybe
theres more of em somewheres in this
old world of ours maybe much larger
ones who knows and those washed-
out strata going back through the co-
manchean and triassic-i mean by that
gents the age of reptiles-well they
show tom mustve fallen into a pretty
old canon he built up his yarn well 

  sure-but how does that clear him
horse hoag asked it just means hes
a good liar but what about it

  sure toms a liar old prof ringo
agreed grinning wisely only he dont
know it he believes everything he
says  and he added grinning still
wider he believes it even though he
knows hes got no shred of proof there
was any such critter in that canon
box canon mystery

 tom rexas mumbled an objection
the buzzards-the skeleton-

  the skeleton was floated up thrown
up you might say disgorged from the
swamp because of those rains you told
us about you said they made a flood
and things were moving in the swamp
maybe this happened many times
through the years a regular thing a
sinking of the skeleton then a shoving
up the water itself maybe had a pre-
servative in it like tannic acid you
saw bones that werent fossilized they
looked to you like buzzards had just
cleaned em

  tom shook his head vaguely he was
in a torture of doubt himself he seemed
to be weakening losing confidence in his
own senses but the buzzards were
there he cried i saw them and
the trap was sprung 

  the old assayer grinned gently this
time thats simple enough funny
the explanation didnt strike you right
off course you thought of only one
answer-the prehistoric critter you
couldnt light on the simplest answer of
all the buzzards got after the dead
wolf it was they the buzzards and
nothing else that sprung your trap

 toms face was blank his eyes big
beaten i thought you were helping me
out prof but even you think every-
thing i told you is up in my head
dreaming dts-and what else he
rubbed his forehead struck it maybe
-i wonder-maybe it wasnt there
look son the assayer said touch-
ing his arm with a fatherly pat i be-
lieve you told the truth you saw what
you saw of course you did but like
you say it just wasnt there

they all saw nell leroyd go to tom
and put her arm around his bent
shoulder she knew well enough that
two men like tom rexas and cal car-
ter would not go berserk with a fear of
something they had only conjured up in
their heads they were brave men
their fear had just cause toms hand
went up groping for hers she clutched
it it seemed to give him strength the
helpless stare left his eyes perhaps that
touch of her hand gave him back some
faith in himself faith in his own sanity

  he said challengingly dont think
ill back down on anything ive said
hoag

 horse hoags enormous shoulders
shrugged then i reckon this inquest

is over folks weve heard how cal
carter was killed what the prof says
dont clear up the case any moren to
say that the prisoner is lying only he
dont know it all i can do if you
gents have nothing to say to the con-
trary is to hold tom rexas for trial
he took the gun from the table and
stepped to the safe guess this exhibit
a better be locked up we all believe
the story it tells

and how about the bone sheriff
 nell leroyd asked they all saw
her hands one holding toms the other
stroking his shoulder with such a gentle
caress that the old battered cow-men of
chloride could only think of a mother
calming a nervous child

  all right get the bone hoag said
because of nell leroyds attitude that
forgotten tiling in the gunnysacks had
assumed a sudden serious import the
bones the only evidence the defense can
offer seems like the sheriff grunted
if he can use it to prove that a dino-
saur crawled around some swamp in
mexico maybe a jury will believe him
doc pickens has it unpacked already
chief one of the deputies said hes
been giving it the once-over

  the horse doctor came in wiping his
mustache after a drink his sharp eyes
picked out the venerable old assayer

  you know something about these
things prof the horse doctor said in a
queer voice you were telling us about
those dinosaur bones they found up in
montana awhile back

  the prof nodded

  well how old were they do you
figure

  plenty old go back to the trias-
sic the montana triassic they call it
you figure this fossil is that old or
what

  its a humerus i know enough about
horse bones to tell that a humerus and
radius and of a pretty big critter three-
four times biggern a horse and i mean
a northern montana horse not our little
fuzztails down here its a giant reptyle
all right only how can it be a fossil
bone

  if its a giant reptile the prof said
wiping his thick lenses impressively
its a fossil and belongs to the triassic
which makes it a horse on you prof
unless you can answer this how can it
be a fossil bone when it still has marrow
inside of it

another out-of-the-ordinary story by kenneth perkins will appear in an early issue

         a swift-paced novel of a newspaper mans adventure
         with battle murder and sudden death-by the able au-
         thor of toy dartagnan and death song in spain

ideas are dangerous things you
can raise more hell with a single
idea than you can with a ton of
dynamite thats why newspaper
reporters arent supposed to get ideas
they arent supposed even to think
their job is to report what other peo-
ple think they think and do it fast ac-
curately and in plain english-which is
just where peglum hartness made his
mistake he got an idea about a cer-
tain politician and the fire-plugs he
started to think about it which was
bad and then he wrote that story
which was worse

  net result he got fired

  now maybe the politician was some
kind of crook maybe he did buy up a
lot of old fire-plugs the big city had dis-
carded years ago maybe he did paint
them and polish them and sell them to the
turnford city fathers for thirty thousand
dollars in cash and taxes    so as edi-
tor standish remarked forcefully what
why bring that up  why of all things
drag the turnford examiner into that
even at election-time when everybody
is slinging mud and it doesnt matter
much its dangerous to start that kind
of a clean-up-our-crooked-city crusade

but for a paper to run a story like that
when everything is quiet and the adver-
tising is rolling in is just sticking out
your chin

  and so peglum got fired and this story
had a beginning it was three days aft-
er the sad event of his dismissal that
peglum joined his ex-colleagues who re-
mained on the examiner staff in a sort
of farewell party which was held in bar-
neys saloon newspaper men are like
that and it was fairly natural that aft-
er the fourth or the fifth or maybe the
tenth round of upstate applejack peg-
lum should stagger to his feet and de-
liver his own valedictory oration

  orated peglum

  now listen gang this is good-by
me im leaving this town and im quit-
ting newspapers for good nobody has
any guts any more you cant write a
decent story freedom of the press is
a myth you cant work on a news-
paper today and keep your self-re-
spect-

  yeah interrupted sports-writer eag-
an an older perhaps a wiser man and
peglums good friend and you cant
eat self-respect peg ever try it

  peglum ignored the aphorism

buttonville

by fulton grant

illustrated by l r gustavson

  so im quitting he went on im
goin out west where things are new
and fresh and im going into trade
maybe the grocery business ive got
a little money-not much but some
my dad left me a couple of thousand
im going out west and sell groceries
in a small town somewhere-

  eagan interrupted again

  nuts my boy hazel nuts and ca-
shew nuts no newspaper man ever
quit the game you couldnt do it if you
tried and besides what about this ad
i answered for you

  what ad

  well i cut a clipping out of the
business opportunities list the day you
got fired and i wrote an answer signed
your name i got a letter back this
morning oh well maybe you dont
want to see it go sell your groceries
son go have your idyl in cheese and
crackers-

  leme see that ad  snapped peglum

there was a small ripple of mirth
from peglums ex-colleagues as he
snatched the clipping with far more
eagerness than one might expect from
a determined grocer said the ad

  for sale weekly newspaper bargain
  town  circ small good chance for
  good man amateurs abstain

                box  buttonville ny
peglum grinned thanks eagan
youre a pal is it straight that you an-
swered this in my name

  sure look at the answer i got
peglum opened the envelope the let-
ter was scrawled rather than written
on a sheet of ordinary news-print proof-
paper-scrawled in blue pencil in a
slanting hand suggestive of a schoolboys
dear sir

    i have your letter advise you come

                    p winkoe ed

                       buttonville vigilante

  that said peglum is too good to
be true its a fake there isnt any
such paper

  the hell there isnt i looked it
up stated eagan its got a circula-
tion of  readers sworn and notarized
advertising rates four cents a line
founded -

  peglum grinned
  gang he said the new editor of
the buttonville vigilante is buying the
drinks my train leaves around three
am barney pour some more poison

if you have never heard of button-
ville it proves only that fame does not
spread as far and as fast as is commonly
reported by every count you should
have heard of buttonville actually you
may have contact with buttonville daily
and nightly for it is no less than a fact
-as is boastfully claimed by the long
banner which the chamber of commerce
has hung across the station plaza for all
to see that-

 buttonville buttons the world

  buttonville does precisely that with-
out buttonville you would be indecent
subtly and succinctly buttonville has
insinuated itself into your waking and
sleeping life you wear buttonville up-
on your shirts nighties and pajamas
upon your trousers and unmentionables
buttons are made elsewhere-in new
york city in rochester and in warsaw
new york but for real devotion to the
art and craft of button-making the busy
little town of buttonville is the berries
peglum hartness arrived at button-
ville toward ten oclock the young
morning was crisp its sunlight crisper
and there was an atmosphere of alert-



dont refuge me hartness take
it for five hundred-the press alone
is worth that

ness and industry on the streets of but-
tonville which was not at all usual in a
small town

peglums initial act after debarking
from his train was to pass through the
station toward the restaurant where he
planned to breakfast en route how-
ever he stopped at the news-stand and
requested a copy of the buttonville vig-
ilante the attendant seemed disconcert-
ed indeed astonished at the request

  the vigilante oh yes i guess they
still print it but i dont believe i have
one-dont sell many of them here
now heres the progress-thats our big
paper here mighty fine too

  but peglum did not want the prog-
ress and it was not until the news-
vendor fearful lest he lose all chance
of sale searched about under piles of
magazines and periodicals that he fi-
nally located a crumpled dirty and bad-
ly torn copy of the vigilante

  peglum paid his five cents and left
the stand filled with misgivings these
misgivings were not assuaged at all
when as he sipped his breakfast coffee
he discovered that the paper was only
four pages in size totally devoid of ad-
vertising printed in an uninspiring and
antiquated type-face and written in
stuffy rustic utterly small-townish
language no wonder thought peglum
that this paper was for sale and yet
here was an opportunity-a chance to
apply his own years of absorbed knowl-
edge his own methods his own edi-
torial craft and to build this a totter-
ing rag into a real newspaper to rival
the buttonville progress or any others

  breakfast completed peglum took a
taxicab and drove to the vigilante of-
fices they were not from the exterior
impressive they were housed in an
ancient two-story building of red brick
which had once been painted even the
ivy which clambered weakly around it
seemed to be looking about for a less
disreputable haunt

one does not expect upon entering
the editorial sanctum of even a small-
town newspaper to see a leprechaun
squatting on the sacred editorial desk
and smoking a cigar nearly as long as
his own diminutive arm leprechauns
are rather associated with crocks of gold
the green bogs of ireland and tales of
fey than with the fourth estate but
here nevertheless was a leprechaun-
dirty bedraggled ink-stained with bright
red hair and large freckles which fairly
covered his wizened little face

  peglum accepting for the moment
this incongruity spoke pleasantly to the
creature

  hello son he said wheres the
boss 

 the leprechaun blew unpleasant smoke
in peglums face and replied rudely

  who wants to know whats it to
yuh 

  now peglum did not like this atti-
tude peglum was not accustomed to
small boys and more especially did he
lack patience with rude small boys
moreover peglum hartness was not of
a temper easily to accept rudeness from
any individual large or small and so he
reached out with a swift hand seized
the brat by belt and trousers lifted him
from his perch on the desk and dangled
him in midair scaring him so that the
cigar dropped from his mouth and fell
to the floor in a shower of sparks

  listen you fresh kid peglum told
him you go find winkoe and tell him
hartness is here get it hartness-
h-a-r-t-n-e-s-s and if hes not here
in two minutes ill skin you for shoe-
leather now get going

  and the boy got going peglum
heard his feet pounding up a flight of
stairs in the rear and presently he
heard them descending again joined by
a slower less energetic pair of feet and
then a shadow stepped into the room

  shadow the man certainly was if peg-
lums own figure of speech be permitted
his profile suggested a deflated rubber

balloon plainly he had been a big man
plainly he had been strong and possessed
of virile rather handsome and very con-
vincing features but just as plainly
something had happened to this man
causing the fullness to sag the flesh to
vanish the skin to hang about his frame
like the fabric of a deflated dirigible
clinging to its steel skeleton and his
very voice itself seemed tired

  how he breathed with that great
effort do-you-do hartness arent
you im-winkoe you know   
wont you-sit down

  and peglum feeling the contagion of
the mans fatigue sank into a chair op-
posite the editorial desk and waited for
winkoe to find strength to carry on their
interview

  seated however the man seemed to
revive a little

  why he demanded almost sharply
did you have to leave your job on the
turnford examiner

  peglum had scarcely expected this di-
rect query but decided to be frank

  i was fired they didnt like a story
i wrote-if its any of your business
winkoe nodded

  its my business to see if youre a
liar im a liar hartness i dont want
this paper to get into the hands of an-
other liar you wouldnt understand
it but im a living lie i want this
paper to be free ive damned near
ruined this paper myself im no good
hartness might have been but i was a
damned fool i dont want to die know-
ing this paper will just go on sinking
die

  it amounts to that now how much
will you pay me for this business

this was too fast-too complex per-
sonal confessions dont enter into
business the man was crazy to expect
peglum to buy anything on a snap judg-
ment crazy anyhow something was
wrong with him better be careful

  what makes you think i want to
buy it mr winkoe  peglum demanded
youre assuming too much how do
i know what its worth you can hard-
ly buy a copy on the news-stand its
not exactly popular apparently

  seemingly strengthened by resent-
ment winkoe rose abruptly

  popular hell my father founded
this paper hartness and he was a great
man but they killed him hartness-
just as theyre killing me they hated
him hartness because he wouldnt play
the blue book magazine

their dirty games then they got me
hartness-and theyll get you too if
you let them popular paper you
dont look like the kind of a fellow who
will bootlick his way into a popular suc-
cess popular ha-ha ha-ha

  the man was obviously hysterical
better humor him perhaps

that said peglum wasnt quite
what i meant i mean your circulation
and advertising dont seem to be much
winkoe was calm again now and
smiling oddly

  the trouble with this paper hart-
ness is myself im no good im not
a newspaper man anyway i was a
doctor did a fool thing and lost my
license however thats not our affair
the point is you are going to buy this
paper

  you seem pretty sure what kind
of an installation have you

  come ill show you the place
peglum followed the man his en-
thusiasm for the entire idea seriously
dampened by winkoes peculiarities he
could not however fail to be impressed
by the small but complete stereo-plant
and type-foundry by the orderly and
glistening stone or make-ready table
the copious cabinets of orderly classified
hand type and more especially the huge
old-fashioned press glistening from years
of polishing and oiling there was how-
ever no one visible in any of the rooms
and peglum was forced to ask

  wheres your staff

  winkoe gave him a quick stare then
said easily

 day off we print wednesday
morning and distribute at night dont
need anybody until friday afternoon
all right now youve seen the place
whats your offer hartness

  im afraid said peglum that im
not rich enough to consider quite so
pretentious an establishment

this was true but it was not the only
reason for his hesitancy he had an
inner consciousness of something amiss
but winkoe seemed not at all dampened

  three thousand dollars he sug-
gested

  not a chance

  two

  sorry

  one thousand then better snap it
up hartness chance in a million
but as the man sensed the refusal
growing in peglum a look of fear which
was almost panic came into his eyes

  i dont believe id better- peglum
tried to say but the mans near-hysteria
overwhelmed him

  dont dont for gods sake
dont refuse me hartness make it
eight hundred  seven hundred  god
man take it for five hundred-but take
it ive got to have five hundred tell
me youll take it why the press alone
is worth that

his panic had grown into a sort of
anguish it was nothing short of ri-
diculous to offer the bare fixtures of this
little paper for any such sum as five
hundred dollars it didnt make any
sense the man was crazy or perhaps
he didnt own it    something wrong
certainly but if it were a fact it was
the chance of a lifetime a newspaper
mans dream come true

  well winkoe at that price id be
a fool to refuse you whats the mat-
ter with it dont you own it is
your title crooked

  composure suddenly settled upon
winkoe and he smiled saying no no
nothing like that the title is clear
mortgage

  yes said winkoe there are two
mortgages-they amount to a little over
two thousand but they have a consid-
erable time to run

  it was clear to peglum that no bank
or individual would take a mortgage of
two thousand dollars unless the property
was worth more than five whatever
the catch was it could not be that
angle

  at that figure ill buy it winkoe
if you prove title ill give you my
check now but i warn you that youre
being a damned fool get your wit-
nesses and ill sign a bill-of-sale
winkoe laughed

  its my privilege to be a damned
fool my own way he said i have a
bill-of-sale in blank you sign it ill
have it notarized before witnesses at
my lawyers make your check payable
three days from today-thats satur-
day-if you dont mind

  peglum was astonished why he
asked ill do it but it seems stupid
probably is said winkoe but you
dont mind do you

  peglum did not mind he wrote his
check signed winkoes bill-of-sale in
duplicate agreed with winkoes sug-
gestion that the expression one dollar
and other valuable considerations be
substituted for the actual figure it did
murder comes to buttonville

not concern the world that winkoe
should be guilty of such folly or that
peglum should take advantage of it

  winkoe took the check and the docu-
ment and started toward the door

  im going to tom brinks office-hes
my lawyer ill get this witnessed and
notarized and in the meantime i will
bring you the titles and other docu-
ments involved which he keeps on file
for me i guess youd rather stay here
and look around for yourself but come
along if you want

  peglum preferred to remain and
when winkoe had vanished out of the
door he thrust his hands deeply into his
pockets and paced the floor frowningly
in a youthful endeavor to convince him-
self that he had not been guilty of too
great haste in submitting to this extra-
ordinary transaction

  gosh he said aloud as the enor-
mity of the facts confronted him me
an editor aint that sumpin  

  but his embarrassment was complete
when a sudden cackle of laughter burst
from behind him accompanied by a
scampering noise and a red-faced peg-
lum turned to see the wizened leering
face of the leprechaun-like imp of a
prfnters devil darting from behind a
file cabinet and running through the rear
door at the door the urchin turned
and made with his lips a noise as ef-
fectively insulting as it was graphic and
undignified

  editor  said the boy bp-p-p-jjt i
or something approximating those let-
ters then he vanished

for a man who has spent years around
among and amidst the odors and ac-
couterments of a news-press there is no
lodestone more compelling than a new
and unaccustomed plant where the odors
and accouterments have another person-
ality and character thus it was nat-
ural for peglum to proceed as soon as
winkoes back had vanished to the front
and as soon as the rude boys bare feet
had departed to the rear into the lower
depths so to speak of this his new ac-
quisition

  a door opened into a black stairway
leading down into a cement basement
this when peglum had found the light-
switch appeared filled with huge rolls
of news-print stock a quick estimate
told peglum that there would be enough
paper there to print the vigilante for
years to come-unless the present modest
circulation should expand a hundredfold

  there was he noticed a hoist-well-
oiled and almost new-for carrying the
paper from the cellar up to the printing-
press floor level and a chute for convey-
ing it into the cellar from a delivery
truck odd peglum decided queer
too that a paper obviously so poor and
so struggling should have so large a fund
of paper stock

  that was odd but his next discovery
was more so

  returning up the stairs he made an-
other inspection of the press itself acti-
vating some of the moving parts to check
on its usefulness during this inspection
-to peglums astonishment-he found
a package tightly wrapped in newspaper
concealed in the ink-recess upon un-
wrapping this it proved to be even more
astonishing for the wrapped package
contained something hard and solid
shaped a little like an apple dark gray-
white in color and looking like a petri-
fied fruit or a nut save for a bright red
circle of paint which spotted it in one
place what he wondered could it be
and why could it have been intended
to wreck the press no for a saboteur
would have used something of iron or
steel and would have hidden it in a
more delicate part than the ink-recess
queer thing looked like ivory-that
was it ivory and then peglum re-
the blue book magazine

membered the buttons for which the
town is famous vegetable ivory an
ivory nut that was it but again why 

  then the phone rang causing peg-
lum like any newspaper man to jump
at the sound of a phone bell and rush to
answer

  a mans voice said raspingly vigi-
lante office whos talking

  im new here said peglum mr
winkoes out at the moment any mes-
sage 

  listen you i want your namet
snarled the voice this is police head-
quarters are you a guy called hart-
ness 

  thats my name peglum admitted
but i dont care if youre the head g-
man you cant get tough without telling
me what its all about whats the mat-
ter

  youll learn youre from out of
town hey

  turnford just got in on the nine-
forty-five	v

  can you prove that

  sure i can    what the hell-

but the door burst open then and
three uniformed cops charged in one
snatching the phone from peglums
hand and shouting into the transmitter
okay chief yuh kept him fer us
okay sure well be right there

  then to peglum as he put the re-
ceiver on the hook

  get goin guy they want you
what for ive got to wait until
winkoe comes back

  winkoe aint cornin back

  my god-you arrested him

  hell no buddy winkoes dead
dead dead good god he cant
be he was here only twenty minutes
ago why its impossible-

  but the sergeant only replied grimly
yeah save all that youll need it
get going son were in a hurry

  the police roadster sirened its way
down the main thoroughfare of button-
ville and arrived at the municipal hall
which housed the police station in a
very few minutes peglum was brought
into a small office where sat a grizzled
hard-faced fellow in the uniform of a
captain the man waved peglum into a
seat dismissed the attending patrolmen
and stared at peglum for several sec-
onds before saying

  well why did you do it

  what

  murder winkoe

you mean you suspect- my god
youre crazy i didnt know winkoe-
never saw him until ten-thirty this morn-
ing you can ask that kid in his office
what kid

  that freckled-faced brat that works
there he-

  oh that one hes a half-wit buddy
his testimonys no good keep on talk-
ing feller maybe youll say something
i can only say what i know winkoe
took my check and wrote a bill-of-sale
he started out to get the bill notarized
at his lawyers-

  what lawyer

  brink i believe he said i dont-
tom brink hey he pressed a
button then spoke into a desk phone
ordering an invisible agent to bring the
lawyer tom brink to the office then
he returned his gaze to peglum

  thats all i know brink was to give
him the titles he had in his safe and get
some witnesses if the bill-of-sale wasnt
legalized then winkoe must have been
killed on his way to the lawyers where
did they find him

  in the hedge near the corner of high
street and the boulevard-not more
than a hundred yards from the offie
no he hadnt seen the lawyer it was
a -caliber bullet that got him-plugged
him from the back too what you know
about that

  ill do what i can to help you but i
didnt do it why dont you get that
half-wit kid and ask him i was in the
office all the time and the little rat saw
me there

  rat hey

  too fresh for his own good
hm-m-m we looked for young
nutsy-thats his name but we couldnt
find him well have him in later now
wheres the check you said you gave
winkoe

  wasnt it in his pocket

  no how big was it

peglum hesitated here the figure
was so incongruous that he knew it
would cause comment

  why-five hundred dollars

  what 

  thats right five hundred heres
my check-stubs

  the officer ignored the check-book but
said slowly

  you wouldnt expect a jury to be-
lieve you only paid five hundred for that
plant hartness why the machinery
alone must be worth twice that or more
murder comes to buttonville

   i cant help it i didnt want to buy
the paper at all didnt you find the
bill-of-sale

  sure we found that thats how we
got your name but it had not been
notarized and it only said one dollar
and other valuable considerations and
we found something else too

   well 

  this said the captain in your
suitcase

  he laid a small automatic pistol on
his desk and stared fixedly at peglum
who could only stare in return and gasp
but-but it isnt mine  i never owned
a gat in my life i havent opened my
 suitcase since i hit town i just dropped
it inside the vigilante door i-
okay okay feller save all that for
your lawyer well know about that
when we get all the finger-prints

the door opened violently then and
a sandy-haired square-jawed pugna-
cious fellow stamped in

  what the hell are you doing bender
you cant pull me out of my office like
this whenever you get the mood on
you cops are too high-handed now
you listen-

  shut up brink said the captain
quietly theres trouble peter win-
koes been murdered

  winkoe murdered god almighty l
  on his way to your office

  pete winkoe-

  and heres a client for you brink
he just bought winkoes paper his
names hartness

   the sharp gray eyes bit into peglums
tom brink whatever else was keen and
alert and peglum had a sensation of be-
ing sized up and pigeonholed with light-
ning speed

  hartness wants to know if he owns
the paper now brink that bill-of-sale
was never notarized before winkoe was
killed

  brink came back like a flash

  you wouldnt expect me to answer
that would you matter for a court
ruling my opinion is yes if you can
show that you paid him in good faith
otherwise it goes to his estate if any
i gave him a cheok said peglum
but-well the check wasnt on him
when they found the body or so the
captain here tells me

brink shot a glance at captain bender
never trust a cop hartness he
said half-grinning theyre liars by
nature and crooks by trade anything

else gentlemen  ive got people waiting
up in my office

  maybe yes said captain bender
maybe mr hartness will retain you to
defend him

  defend me what the- that was
peglum

  in case we bring charges said the
officer frowning a little or for coun-
sel anyhow im holding you as a ma-
terial witness hartness sorry but
thats the way it is well try and make
you comfortable here but i dont know
enough about you until i can check up
on you im taking no chances

  you cant do that- peglum started
in but the officer snapped

  i cant hey now listen hartness
i found the gun that killed winkoe in
your grip and im going to hold you
unless brink wants to go bond for you
so shut up and take it thats all
and it very evidently was all

  and as though to emphasize the final-
ity of those words the captain made a
sign a patrolman jumped to obey and
presently peglum was being conducted
to the cell-blocks of buttonvilles modern
jail there to be fingerprinted and photo-
graphed and left to meditate and to con-
sider the freakish caprices of fate

at the precise moment when peglum
 hartness was being led down the
cement and stone corridor of the mu-
nicipal hall to the buttonville jail mr
j louis greshop was in his study asleep
his fattish face his pinkish jowls wore
a smile his definitely paunchy stomach
was embraced by his folded hands while
he lounged in the great leather chair mr
greshop was possessed of enough money
and the leisure money brings to yield to
the temptation of closing his eyes when-
ever that temptation should beset him

  but as though the fat a were bent up-
on tangling the life-threads of the pup-
pet called peglum hartness with the
other puppet called j louis greshop at
the very instant when the steel cell-door
closed upon peglum and left him to
meditate an interruption broke into mr
greshops cat-nap the interruption was
called sankey-a tall gaunt hollow-
voiced individual who in the household
of mr greshop held the post of butler
sankey came striding into mr greshops
study bearing in his hands a portable
plug-in telephone while he discreetly
coughed nudged mr greshop gently with
his elbow and said quite loudly

  the telephone sir
pops it never is the moment
to discuss anything you dont
like bnt this is the moment
its going to be decided

  mr greshop grunted puffed snorted
and eventually roused enough to say

  well pass the blasted thing here
sankey

  and as sankey was plugging the in-
strument into the wall he spoke so
casually that no one could have sus-
pected that he was introducing a grave
and ominous tragedy

  the mayors office sir he said

  whereat he handed the instrument to
mr greshop ignored that gentlemans
sharp fully awakened glance and strode
from the room

  hello hello mr greshop had a
way of saying hello that made it sound
like a challenge to battle hello there
who is it greshop talking here   
oh its you purdy whats the mat-
ter what what murdered good
god who did it whod kill poor old
winkoe whats that sold his pa-
per young chap hey holding him
well well ill drop over there this aft-
ernoon about four purdy mind you
wait for me and say send that boy
here to me    what in jail you
dont think he did it material wit-
ness rot thats just rot ill go bond
for him no let him come over here
whats that brink that shyster
im damned if i will now listen
purdy i want that boy here    got
it i want brink out of this hear
me i leave it to you



  and he rang off sharply

  the next act of mr j louis greshop
was to unlock a drawer in his desk and
take from that drawer another telephone
instrument quite plainly a very private
wire of which no member of his house-
hold was aware

  swiftly he dialed a number briskly
he said into the transmitter

  hello faslon listen get me all
the dope on a man named hartness
peglum hartness    h-a-r-t-n-e-s-s
-got it  turnford newspaper man
popped up here this morning no i
never saw him find out if hes a fed
sure use an agency-anything and
listen faslon about that paris trip
   erica seems a little-ah-restless
perhaps youd better hold off for a while
   no well its up to you put
dower on will you

  a brief pause and then he snapped
dower what goes on down there
i thought you had guards who could
guard another case was taken last
night thats fifty thousand dollars
dower that gang has cost us over two
million since last november you and
faslon are responsible remember but
if you cant run that end ill take it
over myself or get somebody who can
got it okay if they want to fight
fight em police be damned theyve
 got nothing on us im shipping tues-
 day night if theres any more loss
 youre out that clear

   then he hung up and closed his eyes
 again

   but sleep did not return for another
 intruder entered mr greshops sanctum
 and stalked-the very word-across the
 thick carpet to plant herself squarely in
 front of him saying

   well pops how about it youve
 been dodging me for two days do you
 call kurt faslon off and make him stop
 bothering me or do i take it into my
 own hands i know hes your asso-
 ciate but if you dont keep him in his
 place im going to use my own methods
 anyhow suppose you do lose some
 money you can afford it now whats
 your answer

   it was plain that mr greshop did not
 like either the tone nor the tenor of his
 daughters straight talking he cleared
 his throat he coughed he wheezed
 and finally he said

    erica-please my dear this isnt just
 the moment-

   she lifted her fine head high

   no pops it never is the moment to
 discuss anything you dont like but
 tfiis is the moment its going to be de-
 cided maybe you can take those high-
 handed methods with kurt and your
 other yes-men but not with your daugh-
 ter pops so youre either going to tell
 me right now that youll send him away
 -tell him to stay away too-or im
 sailing monday on the carpathia-and
 alone

   mr greshop shot his last bolt he
 sighed he looked shaken

   erica dear-im so upset this morn-
 ing theres been a shocking tragedy
 -a murder

   she stared a murder who
   poor old peter winkoe

 poor old-why father youre near--
 ly maudlin i didnt think you liked
 peter he insulted you rather well when
 you tried to buy the vigilante i seem to
 remember but what has peter win-
 koes murder to do with my paris trip
 im sorry and all that but the connec-
 tion isnt clear

 greshop was visibly borne down by
 the weight of his cross

    your light attitude is scarcely becom-
 ing erica the man is dead as a mat-
 ter of fact there is a slight connection
 since you insist i had rather counted
 on you to do something for me

  what -challengingly

  there is a young newspaper man-
name is hartness hes being held by
captain bender in connection with win-
koes murder he apparently has pur-
chased the vigilante im going bail
for the boy

  such altruism id never have be-
lieved it of you pops and hes the
murderer 

  no-im sure not but i suspect
hes something else-a sort of a busi-
ness spy to watch my operations here
i was hoping i could persuade you to
talk with liim-use your womans in-
tuition and check my suspicion

rica laughed frankly

mata hari of commerce eh pops
you dont really mean it

  you insist upon taking things wrong-
ly-but i do mean it my dear it could
amount to something very important-
even ruinous to me this young fellow
bought the vigilante for a mere five hun-
dred dollars winkoe had already re-
fused my offer of ten times that i want
to know how and why there is more
under this than you suppose erica

  i dare say said the girl there
generally is more under anything you do
than meets the eye pops youre only
pretending to be the public-spirited
citizen of buttonville youre only pre-
tending to care about the little mayors
and selectmen and town councilors
youre hiding something under that i
dont care much what it is youre a
multi-millionaire and im happy being
an heiress but you should remember
that there isnt a person in town who
wouldnt cut your throat if he dared
why erica

  yes they would youve ruined too
many people here ruined them the way
you ruined old winkoe-

 stop how dare you accuse me-
im not accusing youve been very
legal pops you would thats your
specialty but youve ridden rough-shod
over too many people and youd do
it to me-if id let you but i wont
no pops youve tried to worm me
around to forgetting about kurt faslon
but i wont forget you want me to
play around with some dumb newspa-
per man to help you out but you wont
even answer me straight about kurt
now you listen to me pops if youll
give me your word to send kurt about
his business-tell him straight and fi-
nally that he neednt bother me any more
the blue book magazine

-ill see your horace greeley and sound
him out if you wont im leaving for
new york this afternoon now thats
the way i am

  she lifted her head and flashed in the
proud consciousness of her own strength
greshop squirmed but he knew that
her mind had been made up

  all right he said finally ill dis-
miss faslon today as far as youre con-
cerned but its dangerous erica hell
make a bad enemy some day hes
stronger than you think

  she flashed her eyes again

  strong hes ruthless if thats what
you mean but kurt isnt strong hes
only careful he lives by social codes
hes careful to see that no one ever
catches him breaking them-but hes a
criminal at heart pops oh i know-
you think hes just smart hes as dis-
honest as any other human more than
most i wouldnt care if he were a
crook frankly and openly but-
erica how can you say-

  thats the way i feel pops youve
made me that way youve given me too
much money too much travel ive lost
interest in the social graces no pops
i want a man-not a yes-man like kurt
faslon and ive no fear of him now
ive got your promise wheres your
suspected murderer-newspaper-man 
greshop made a hopeless gesture with
his hands but brightened again at the
chance of a new topic of conversation

  hell be here any minute have a
cocktail 

  no thanks not if im to play spy
  mind if i do

  no i just mind that you lie to me
so completely

  i i lie to you

  certainly youre concealing some
sort of a racket pops your vegetable-
ivory monopoly doesnt pay upkeep on
this house your local interests are a
smoke-screen why not tell the little
girl im no longer a child

then the tall morose shadow of but-
ler sankey drifted into the room and
his sonorous voice said

  beg pardon sir but there is a po-
liceman downstairs with a gentleman
called hartness the latter insists you
wish to see him sir

  send the cop away said greshop
irritably and the man up here hurry
sankey the man departed and the
ivory-nut magnate turned a flushed face
to his daughter

  erica he said let this be under-
stood between us i give you money-
all you want i make you independent
for life i place no supervision over
you i even have withdrawn my sug-
gestion of kurt faslon for a husband-
although it would have been greatly to
my advantage had you married him and
i ask nothing more for it except one
thing leave me alone im a business
success because i never confide i never
shall-not even to you if certain se-
crets of my business became known i
would die the next day now dont let
me hear you ever refer to this again
is that clear

  not so much force as fear in the
mans voice its effect was marked
however and erica swallowing quick-
ly nodded and said nothing in reply

  then the elevator-gate slid open and
peglum hartness preceded the butler
toward the open door of bishops study

quite as puzzling as the mystery
of winkoes death was the odd be-
havior of the lawyer brink peglum
told himself again and again that there
was something significant in the manner
in which brink fairly evaporated into
thin air as soon as peglum needed coun-
sel what was it something queer

  peglum had liked brink at sight
brink was a fighter apparently he
stood in no awe of the buttonville po-
lice from their chief on down there
was very little courtesy and no fear at
all in his tone as he addressed captain
bender he was blunt and quick he
had plainly sized up peglum and it
seemed favorably and yet when the
domineering captain bender had been
decent enough to suggest that brink
stand as peglums counsel when charges
were brought brink had patently shied
off worse than that he had vanished
-slipped away without a word

  but peglums reverie was broken by
the arrival of no other person than the
rusty-haired lawyer himself almost as
though summoned by telepathy to stand
in his own defense

  brink only nodded coolly as the of-
ficer let him into peglums cell and
waited until the man left them before
saying in a tense near-whisper

  hartness theyre framing you-or
they were i knew it but i couldnt
prove it now theyve lost out and
youre in the clear but i want to know
who would try and frame you

 frame me why how
murder comes to buttonville

  somebody put that gat in your bag
didnt they

  must have i never saw it before
well it was winkoes helper-nutsy
darkle they call him found his finger-
prints all over it and on your bag
whats he say

  brink suddenly looked the importance
of the words he uttered next

 he cant say anything hartness
hes dead

  dead  peglum started up at that
how why

  strangled somebody strangled him
and dragged his body to the very place
where they found winkoe-in the hedge
did it while the cops were standing
guard in front of the office building too
-came from behind the hedge its
completely screwy but it lets you out
they cant hold you now

  im all twisted up brink peglum
confessed

 you and everybody else suppose
you give me your story-complete and
all you can remember twisted up hey
well the idiot sister of that idiot boy is
down at the police-station raising hell
generally theyre a tribe the darkles
father and mother are drunkards-nev-
ei sober sister is absolutely wild-i
mean primitive shes shot people who
went near their house shes bitten cops
wont go to school and that kind of
thing the boy was the best of them
all winkoe kept him there because he
really worked-polished up the press and
things as though they were solid gold
but theyre both crazy and the sister
is screaming that winkoe killed the boy
-she wont even believe winkoes dead
but never mind that now give me your
story hartness i want to get a line on
things

peglum went through the entire re-
cital omitting only the discovery 
of the ivory nut in the printing-press
and the enormous quantities of paper
in the vigilantes cellar these things
did not seem important he ended by
saying

  i tell you brink winkoe was crazy
queer his whole staff must have been
queer

 staff thats good winkoe did
everything alone except clean the press
and unscramble the pi the kid did
that if he told you he had a staff he
was just selling you a paper feller
why why did he want to sell so
badly peglum asked

  i give up but there was an in-
terruption then and the uniformed guard
called to the lawyer saying that he was
wanted inside brink left promising to
return at once and peglum was about
to seat himself again to contemplate the
modified status of things when brink
stepped back and called

  dont answer any questions hear
ill fix things

but hardly had the lawyer vanished
down the corridor with his policeman
when another door opened nearer to
peglums cell and captain bender
came through accompanied by a neat
little man who wore a black jacket and
striped trousers and who looked the per-
fect functionary

  all right hartness said captain
bender youre free mr greshop has
sprung you on bail

  whos he

  the functionary smiled and rubbed
his hands

  mr greshop is our leading citizen
he has gone bond for you and asked
to have you to come to see him at once
peglum had already digested enough
of queer unreasonable or unexplained
happenings he said

  now wait-hold on im pretty
fussy about who goes bond for me
mr greshop said the functionary
from highest olympus owns the other
newspaper in town-merely a local hob-
by for him of course and one of many
interests just why he has interested
himself in you i dont know perhaps
as another newspaper man-

  newspaper man my eye i gather
this greshop sort of cracks the whip
around here eh oh well ill see him
now wheres my lawyer-wheres brink
he was coming back i cant go until
ive seen him

  the sleek one frowned

  everything will be arranged with mr
brink dont trouble yourself every-
thing will be explained to him now if
youre ready mr-ah-hartness-

  and peglum was led out of his cell
through the side door of the corridor
and out into the rear courtyard of the
municipal hall where a police coupe
awaited him

  youll do well to remember that mr
greshop is one of the most powerful men
in the state said the functionary be-
fore the car whirled peglum off he
can make you or break you here in but-
tonville
  peglum winked saying cryptically
  ill write that down thanks

  and then the car rolled away

to say that peglum was surprised at
the magnificence of j louis gresh-
ops imported chateau would be to under-
state he could scarcely believe his
eyes it seemed almost an impossibility
that in the vicinity of smug middle-
class sales-minded buttonville a thing
of so quaint and subtle a beauty could
exist he stared up at the round tow-
er which lifted out of the shorter spires
and turrets he gaped at the lace-
work of stone which cloistered an outer
stairway at the arched and vaulted por-
ticoes and at the fabulous portcullis
and drawbridge which belonged no more
to this day and age than does the louvre
at paris or the blarney castle but the
car rolled over the drawbridge and
through the portcullis and rumbled in-
to a cobbled courtyard where should
have been the clatter of hoofs and the
clash of steel instead of the purr of a
motor and the odor of gasoline

  the lean butler greeted them at an
inner court doorway and bade them wait
until announced returning he dis-
missed the policeman and beckoned peg-
lum to follow him

  as they passed through a maze of
halls and corridors each hung with cost-
ly tapestries exquisite paintings and de-
lightful wood-carvings the tremendous
wealth of the owner impressed itself up-
on peglum who he wondered was this
man greshop persons of such wealth
are news how could this man have
escaped the press then

  the butler led peglum to an elevator
which took them aloft in a cylindrical
tower stopping finally at a cylindrical
room which made the most sumptuous
and exotic lounge it had ever been peg-
lums privilege to see his name an-
nounced sonorously by the butler peg-
lum became conscious of two persons a
fattish baldish paunchy wattle-chinned
man of fifty-five or so in loose com-
fortable garb and a tall striking girl
of the two the girl had the greater force
for impressing herself

  said greshop

 sit down mr hartness youve
been having bad luck and then some
peglum managed to find words
thank you and let me thank you
for going my bail mr greshop what
made you think i didnt kill winkoe
i didnt expect to find a friend here

  greshop flexed the muscles of his flab-
by lips into something like a smile

  hardly friendship hartness do a
man a good turn and youve enslaved
him as the chinese say but youre
pretty well exonerated since that poor
boys body was found what do you
make of it all

  but before peglum could form his
reply the girl had broken in

  you might introduce me pops she
stepped forward and added as she held
out her hand in frank greeting im
erica greshop mr hartness my father
has a one-track mind which probably
makes his fortune but is hardly a social
asset now do tell us what your theory
about this murder is im filled with
morbid curiosity

  peglum recoiled just a little too
smart this girl peglum didnt like that
type lots of them work on newspa-
pers    never know quite where you
stand with women like that not a nose
for news but morbid curiosity-as she
said herself

  but peglum manufactured a smile for
the occasion and managed to reply to
both of them together

  i havent any theories at all j
dont know anything at all about win-
koe except what i saw of him this morn-
ing i gathered he was a little-er-
queer wasnt he

  greshop nodded but the girl said
perhaps thats a good word for it
peglum did not press for a definition
of this but went into a recital of events
as they had occurred omitting virtual-
ly nothing-virtually because there was
one small omission for some reason
which he could scarcely have explained
to himself peglum avoided all mention
of his odd discovery of an ivory nut in
the vigilantes press

greshop beamed and puffed genially
when peglum had finished

  quite an adventure wasnt it and
now im to understand that i have a
rival in town eh  a newspaper rival
you knew probably that i own the
progress hartness

  vaguely yes admitted peglum
well so now you own the vigilante
a little competition may be a good thing
poor winkoe couldnt do much im
afraid

  its not at all sure that i own it
peglum said recalling the ill-fated bill-
of-sale and the vanished check my
lawyer says its up to a court
sam

  lawyer greshops surprise seemed
honest enough i didnt know you had
taken legal counsel

  its winkoes lawyer really-names
firink i had no intention-

  greshop expanded in a loud chuckle
oh brink he said how in the
world did you happen to pick him-of
all lawyers-

  peglum resented the implication he
liked brink

  whats the matter with him he de-
manded but greshop replied easily
oh nothing at all except-well i
imagine i would choose quite a different
-ah-sort of a fellow if i were held on
a serious charge something not quite
so-ah-rustic however if it should
come to that hartness ill see that you
have adequate legal advice

  peglum would have made the formal
gesture of thanking greshop though his
feeling of dislike for him was irresist-
ible despite greshops affability but
the industrialist suddenly rose saying
why dont you two young people go
down into the garden show mr hart-
ness around erica  or perhaps youd
care for a cocktail im going to ask
you to excuse me for a short time-work
to be done here-must be alone for a
while ill join you presently

  and peglum found himself spirited
into the elevator and carried down the
tower to its base where across the far-
ther courtyard stretched a magnificent



replica of some classical geometric gar-
den a chain of tiny lakes a swimming-
bath of white marble and a terrace with
little tables under canopies

  erica rang for the butler and when he
appeared urged peglum to join her in a
cocktail this he refused

  sorry he said but ive got to
keep my head carefully im still un-
der suspicion youll remember

  she nodded but it was clear she did
not like his abstaining conversation be-
tween them became suddenly difficult
there was strain and tension and fi-
nally erica greshop set her glass firmly
down and stared at peglum with a curi-
ous smile

vou are a unique experience to me
i mr hartness she said ive never
known a man who disliked me quite so
obviously and- at first sight its rather
exciting would you care to explain
your feeling it would be a good lesson
in psychology-for me of course
peglum had not expected that he
didnt dislike this girl it was a dif-
ferent feeling she was too smart and
too rich to be so smart there was
something incongruous about her but
he was able only to say

  it isnt that i dont like you miss
greshop i just dont travel in your
the blue book magazine

world-and i dont want to much im
a little baffled by you by your father
too i dont quite see why anyone should
suddenly go bail for a stranger or why
his daughter who is rich enough and
handsome enough to have anything or
anybody she wants should hang around
and waste time with that same stranger
it was a pretty good statement of
how he felt and it had its effect eri-
cas eyes grew larger and a little softer
as she looked at him surprised at his
frankness then suddenly she reached
out her hand across the table and took
his shaking it as a man shakes hands

  im glad you said that she said
thanks

  then she stood up quickly and seemed
about to move away from the table when
a footstep in the gravel made them both
turn to see j louis greshop waddling
toward them hurriedly and beaming

  i have good news for you hart-
ness he called out and coming up
he slid heavily into a seat saying with
puffing interruptions first its that
youre free of all suspicion now

  thats good i felt they couldnt
keep me

  i dont-ah-quite know but ive
been informed by telephone that-ah-
the police have taken another tack but
the big thing is this hartness judge
nostrand is a particularly close friend
of mine-he is the ranking authority in
judicial matters here in the county i
brought to his attention your-ah-odd
situation-about the vigilante i mean
and he has given me an official opin-
ion unless some one can show cause
why you should not enter into posses-
sion you are the actual owner of the pa-
per hartness if winkoe had heirs
they could fight this decision in a higher
court naturally but since he has none
youre the owner congratulations 

peglums confusion was natural it
was plain greshop had brought in-
fluence or pressure of some sort to bear
upon the judge matters like this arent
settled by telephone or in a few minutes
still if it was done it was done and
peglum knew he should be grateful fie
spoke his gratitude very honestly and
not without a little embarrassment but
greshop treated the affair as a trifle

  nothing at all hartness he said
maybe im not really a newspaper
man but owning a paper has made
me feel-well close to it men of the
press stick together and all that you

know but-well ivtf a proposition for
you why dont you sell me that paper
give you a good profit for it too
sell it to you

  sure ive wanted to buy it from
winkoe and hes refused me ill take
it over and make the two of them into
a daily instead of a weekly this town
can go it ill pay you two thousand
cash hartness

  thats very-very fine of you mr
greshop peglum managed to say
but ill-ill have to think it over
you see-well this paper has got to be
a sort of dream with me-

  fifteen hundred dollars is no dream
hartness good sound profit on five
hundred eh

  i realize that but i cant decide now
ill-ill let you know mr greshop

he had scarcely said the words before
he grew conscious that j louis
greshop was deeply angered and was
restraining his emotion only with diffi-
culty the fat man got quickly to his
feet

  very well he said think it over
hartness but dont delay too long
im not in the habit of making offers
like that now ill have sankey driv
you back to town

  erica spoke then breaking in quickly
ill take mr hartness back pops
im driving in anyhow and before her
father could form a reply she had locked
her arm under peglums and was walk-
ing him toward the inner courtyard gate
where a long-nosed speedy-looking car
stood waiting as though impatient to be
going

  dont stand on ceremony mr hart-
ness she was saying in a low voice not
to be heard by her father the time
to be going is now try to understand
but peglum did not understand from
the tense hush of her voice from the
haste of her step peglum sensed that
this girl was trying to warn him against
something against what her father

  in the car roaring down the park-
way toward buttonville proper peg-
lum could not speak the questions which
surged in his mind but when erica
slowed for the first traffic signal as the
parkway merges with greshop boule-
vard and enters the village peglum de-
manded an explanation

  whats wrong miss greshop he
asked i didnt know your father put
such store by the vigilante i didnt
mean-


murder comes to buttonville

  no she said cutting in you didnt
mean-didnt mean to buy it in the first
place didnt mean to get mixed up in
a murder you didnt mean anything at
all you ought to have stayed away
and kept on writing nice little stories
for nice little papers peglum hartness
youre playing with things that are big-
ger than you are youve got a nice
name too it would look well carved in
granite i wonder how it would feel to
have them throwing earth in your face
while the choir sings rock of ages
you wont mean to be there but if you
dont get out of this town theres where
youre going to be i dont know why
im telling you this i cant prove it
im having a hunch i know you dont
like me and i suppose that should hurt
my vanity but i cant help it may-
be ive got a latent mother-complex
that i never suspected before  i
dont know  only know that my in-
tuition tells me that youre running in-
to real danger and i dont want to see
it happen she stopped the car em-
phatically and they ground to the curb

  now here we are at the post of-
fice she went on before peglum could
offer any comment at all you can find
your way any place you want from here
-it had better be the railroad station
good-by peglum hartness i hope i
never see you again

  and erica greshop opening the door
of the coup even gave peglum a little
push with her hand as though to prompt
him by this gesture to heed more quick-
ly the sudden direct and disconcerting
advice she had so surprisingly offered

  and no words had come from peglum
before the car was roaring down toward
the plaza leaving him drenched in the
fumes of gasoline and lost in a cloud of
vague misgivings

 now that he murmured aloud
turning toward the municipal hall and
the police headquarters where his bag
was still being held is quite a girl or
he added slowly thoughtfully is she

captain michael bender absolute
monarch of buttonville in all that
pertained to the maintenance of law and
order was in an unhappy and uncom-
fortable mood in the usually placid
community of buttonville major crime
was unheard-of there had been rob-
bery forgery and an occasional bit of
willful arson but downright murder was
something which the small industrial-
specialty town of buttonville had never

known in the twenty years of captain
benders services and bender knew his
limitations he was no rural sherlock
holmes no specialist in crime detection
no scientific sleuth nor did he pretend
to be furthermore he did not expect
his staff of good honest simple country
cops to be able adequately to cope with
a twofold murder which look at it as
he might passed from the realm of usual
into that of the fantastic

  but the worst of benders embarrass-
ment was caused by things not directly
associated with the crime to wit he
had seen fit to arrest and hold on sus-
picion the young man hartness he did
not believe him guilty and the death of
the darkle boy cleared him absolutely
but bender resented the interference of
a man like j louis greshop who had
interfered through the weakling mayor
nor was that all sitting in his office
at the moment were two federal men
who had arrived only the night before
they claimed his aid saying

  well just stay around captain no
reason why we cant cooperate eh

the answer was no no reason at all
no reason except that these fed-
erals were from the narcotic bureau
and had a fantastic idea of trailing a
narcotic-smuggling outfit through but-
tonville imagine it narcotics in but-
tonville  as if these hicks ever-

  but what made chief bender unhappy
was the casual way this federal dick
called paisley sauntered into the little
private office where the captain was
plotting and tabulating the chances and
evidence to get a line on all possible
angles in connection with winkoes mur-
der he had sauntered-that was the
word for it-with his hands in his pock-
et and a pipe dangling froim his mouth
looking like a college boy

  by the way chief he said we
have an idea we can help you a little
your murder case i mean did you
know this fellow winkoe was a cocaine
addict

  good god no impossible queer
he was but no dope fiend

  well said paisley he had a prison
record he was a doctor in chicago-
good practice too clever surgeon did
some remarkable plastic work during
the war he performed an experimental
operation while he was under the in-
fluence of cocaine-must have been a
real snowstorm and the patient died
he got twenty years for manslaughter
the blue book magazine

it was nutsy put
the gut hi your
hag they found
his fingerprints all
over it

commuted to five you see bender
we kind of keep records of that sort of
thing now maybe thatll hand you a
clue or something

  then he had sauntered out again
peter winkoe a drug-addict old
hiram winkoes son well that was
news and it put a new angle in the
possibilities but it didnt change the
fact that that little brat nutsy had been
killed certainly he wasnt a drug-ad-
dict prenatal affliction malnutrition
maybe dementia prsecox but certainly
not dope you cant tie up a thirteen-
year-old boy with a dope-ring

  and bender began his list of points
all over again

it was the other federal man who
came in now his name was stone
ralph stone he was too young to be
a cop the federal bureau must be
crazy to take kids like that and set
them out to catch drug-smugglers but
stone sauntered in also smoking a pipe
and asked quietly

  whos this bird called brink chief
lawyer or something

  thats it said bender a second-
rate lawyer been here three years
handles mostly claims and minor things
made an enemy of greshop though
when he dug up the title on winkoes
newspaper property and kept it for win-
koe seems clever enough only lazy
and grouchy why 

  well we dont know hes not a
member of the bar

  huh  you mean he aint got a right
to practice

  thats it wheren the world did he
come from

  why-i dont know never thought
to ask

  maybe youd better-or we will no
you do it chief wouldnt want him
to know that the federal bureau is in-
terested

  sure-but brinks no crook hes
a pretty good guy im sure-

  well hes practicing law without be-
ing admitted to the bar or else hes
using a fake name or both sound him
out will you

  first winkoe now tom brink what
next would they dig up

  but the next modification of captain
benders preliminary analysis came from
a new source one of his office men
put his head into the doorway saying
this young feller hartness is back
chief wants his bag and things
send him in said bender and pres-
ently peglums lanky form came through
the door

  i suppose youll let me have my
clothes out of that bag they planted a
gun in he suggested grinning a little

  sure sit down tell me wftat
youre going to do better hang around
until the case is cleared up even if i did
have to let you go hartness

  im staying mr greshop got a rul-
ing from some judge that the vigilante
belongs to me im going to print that
paper

mr greshop eh well thats all
ive got for you then hartness sorry
but im busy

peglum still sat in his chair

well ive got something for you i
just left miss greshop at the post office


murder comes to buttonville

she drove me into town i walked from
there to here chief and in that three
minutes i noticed something that ill bet
your cops havent discovered

  whats that

 ever hear of a new york gunman
named dugalb-red dugalb

  sure we read the papers up here
and another called midge farjink
yeah ive heard of both of em
well they both got into town just
now-on the noon train i saw them
coming up from the station they went
into the post office i used to work on
the new york papers when dutch slitz
was running his beer racket and they
were both gunning in his mob never
forget a face bender thought that
would interest you

  very evidently it did too bender sat
up stiffly in his chair

  you absolutely sure

  positive

  they-well youre sure they just got
in they could a been the guys that
bumped winkoe

  peglum shook his head

  i didnt see them get off that train
but they had bags and the train was
still in the station and when they came
outof the post office they went to the
commerce hotel across the plaza no
they didnt kill winkoe

  bender wanted to think

  all right hartness im much obliged
tell the sergeant at the desk i said to
release your bag im glad you didnt
have prints on that gun hartness-
didnt really think you pulled that one
though well so long

  farjink and dugalb-new york gun-
men of the small-caliber type not lead-
ers just mobsters what would they
be doing in buttonville it was a ques-
tion that captain michael bender was
far from answering

peglum hartness awakening the next
morning was one of eagerness and en-
thusiasm he had gone directly from
the police-station where he had re-
covered his bag to a hotel somewhat
pretentiously called buttonville towers
the towers were of wood and rose to
the vast height of ten feet above the sec-
ond story which faced the post office
across greshop boulevard there he
had dined bathed and sprawled upon
his bed clad in pajamas thinking to
analyze and classify the extraordinary
happenings of his past several hours
very little classification or analysis if

any was accomplished however for soon
sleep overtook peglum and it was not
until the hotels hand-shaken breakfast-
gong clattered by his door that he
emerged into the consciousness that he
was-no matter what the circumstances
-owner and editor of a newspaper-a
stone so to speak upon which he peg-
lum hartness might carve the record of
his life and work

so it was a natural thing that peg-
lum should hasten through his break-
fast snatch a copy of the rival paper
the progress from a stand and hurry
toward his newly acquired possession

  a uniformed policeman stood on the
doorstep but saluted deferentially as
peglum walked to the door

  good morning sir he said civilly
the chief wanted me to stay until ye
got here maybe therell be somebody
else come down to look around a little-
maybe the chief himself but it was
mostly to keep the crowd away from the
place after the murder of poor old win-
koe

  peglum nodded and the officer left
conscious of duty done

  a rapid if professionally accurate pe-
rusal of this rival newspaper owned by
j louis greshop and ambitiously called
the progress confirmed peglums worst
suspicions to compete with it would
be a herculean task not for lack of
ability or ideas but rather for lack of
the hard cash needed to produce the
typical syndicate-made newspaper so
commonly found in the majority of re-
mote industrial towns the progress
was not an exceptional sheet its edi-
torials were mediocre its local column
trivial but it carried five costly comic-
strips bought from syndicates echoes of
national news purchased from the as-
sociated press and it was printed on
twenty-four pages each black with good
well-paid advertising

  here peglum knew was a challenge
he had no money he had only an
office a press and his own wits   

  peglums first act as owner-editor of
the vigilante was to take an accurate
inventory of stock it required over an
hour tp sweep through the morgue the
date-files the clippings the bound vol-
umes and the other office paraphernalia
and to list them for future use then
he descended into the cellar to inspect
the wealth of paper he knew was stored
there in those great rolls a plan had
been forming in his mind he would
the blue book magazine

he knew need a considerable amount of
paper to materialize his plan and so
after checking no fewer than thirty great
roll-drums of paper-enough to last the
vigilante over two years even if circu-
lation should double-he set about get-
ting ready a small hand-truck to aid him
in hauling one of the rolls to the hoist
thence to haul it again into the print-
shop for almost immediate use

  paper in quantity is surprisingly heavy
but the weight of that first roll which
peglum attempted to pry off its perch
atop a second roll outdid anything peg-
lum had ever known in newsprint he
pried with a crowbar he tugged and
he sweated he succeeded in moving
the roll causing it to veer toward the
two boards he had placed for its descent
into his truck then with a final heave
he forced it to the improvised track and
-it plunged down with a crash then-

  rolls of news-print are generally forty-
eight inches wide and may contain a full
half-mile of paper they are solid and
strong but here directly in front of
peglum was the astounding phenomenon
of a news-print roll bursting open from
the slight shock of being bounced down a
short incline of some three feet burst
indeed what appeared to be the butt
end of the roll had cracked like a butter
firkin and through the office was spill-
ing something that clattered and bounced
and clicked like several hundred billiard-
balls being dumped onto the cellar floor
and when peglum retrieved one of the
objects and brought it nearer the dim
electric light the exclamation of sur-
prise he gave was no less than justified

  for what he held in his hand was
nothing else than another nut of vege-
table ivory identical-even to the round
red spot on its dirty white surface-with
the similar nut he had found hidden in
the ink-roller recess of the big press
wrapped in newspaper

  ill be damned he said aloud

further investigation showed that
the broken roll of paper was no more
than a blind a decoy a hollow drum of
wood covered with paper to simulate the
standard news-print roll and packed
full with nuts of the same vegetable
ivory and as suspicion burned him
peglum inspected each of the other rolls
pounding them with the pry-bar and
shaking them as best he could by hand
only to discover that they too were
false hollow and presumably filled with
vegetable-ivory nuts also

  here was a curiosity here was an
oddity here was a mystery and here
also and notwithstanding the thrill of its
fantastic nature was a tragedy for if
these rolls contained no paper how was
peglum hartness new editor of an old
paper to print that first creation which
if his plan should materialize would
shock and startle buttonville into the
purchase of their forgotten vigilante

he went upstairs and dropped into
a chair he sat long and sorrow-
fully trying to make sense of his dis-
covery why would winkoe a former
doctor-or so he said-and a newspaper
editor stock his cellar full of ivory-
nuts even cleverly disguised ivory nuts
no answer why should ivory nuts be
hidden werent they the very essence
of buttonvilles buttons how could
there be anything to conceal about ivory
nuts-and if there were something about
them to conceal it followed that these
must be some especial variety of nuts
it didnt make any sense didnt work
out didnt add up but there was one
thing which seemed evident even if not
substantiated the presence of those
vegetable-ivory nuts in the cellar of the
vigilante seemed in some way as yet
unexplained associated with the murder
of peter winkoe and his young helper
it could be classified as a clue it could
be added to the list of oddities which
surrounded the whole double mystery-
the panic of eagerness which made win-
koe sell his paper for a mere five hun-
dred dollars winkoes urgency about
post-dating the check the vegetable-
ivory nut concealed in the ink-box of the
press and now this store of nuts in the
cellar add to these things the presence
of those two gunmen dugalb and far-
jink the none-too-subtle warning erica
greshop had given him and the eager-
ness her father had shown to purchase
the vigilante and you had a puzzle that
would stump sherlock holmes himself

  and then just to make it more com-
plex some one-presumably the mur-
derer of winkoe-had killed the little
half-wit boy after the boy nutsy had
concealed the gun that killed winkoe in
peglums bag every detail was a com-
plete non sequitur to the next detail-
disassociated unrelated or were they
all related through the queer inex-
plicable thread which bound everything
together with the prosaic commonplace
commercial product vegetable ivory  it
came back to that-to vegetable ivory
murder comes to buttonville

  well peglum decided after long
minutes of such analysis its not really
my business except the story i can get
out of it id better let this cop bender
know about the fake paper rolls

  and he lifted the receiver asked the
operator for police headquarters and sat
waiting and wondering so rapt was
peglum in his reverie that he did not
hear the outer door of the vigilante
office open did not hear careful foot-
steps in the outer hall and the sound
of the voice was startling in its sudden-
ness barked the voice

  reach pal stick em up
peglum reached dropping the receiver
to the desk and staring wide-eyed

  there were two men in the room one
a heavy-set putty-faced slav with a
head shaped like an inverted turnip and
evil eyes which were too close together
this one peglum knew at first glance
was called midge farjink in the circle of
thugs with whom he consorted in new
yorks half-world the other had red
hair and a heavy automatic the hair
identified him and the automatic made
his identity even more convincing than
the flattened nose and cauliflower ears
which seemed sunken into his head until
they resembled fungus growths this
man was the killer red dugalb peg-
lum knew it knew their natures knew
the uselessness of protest his only ad-
vantage was that he knew their faces
and identities whereas such dull-witted
thugs as these would not be likely to re-
member the face of a reporter they had
only seen casually years ago in another
city peglum reached grinned and said
greetings gents you dont need the
artillery i havent a gun whats on
your mind

  red dugalb replied grindingly

  shut up you go case the joint
downstairs midge ill handle this mug

midge far jinks squat body lumbered
through the rear door into the
composing-room and peglum could hear
his feet descending into the cellar

  he returned at once

  hey he said giving peglum a dark
glare somebodys bust a case we
gotta make time the junk is all over
the place on the floor

  yeah gees the bossll be sore im
taking this punk back then you wait
fer the truck red dugalb then turned
on peglum cmere wise guy you
walk alongside me see you make a
little break and i plug yuh got it

you walk alongside o me and crawl
into that car i got parked by your door
thats all yuh do now get goin

  the automatic jammed into peglums
side peglum stepped forward dugalb
bristled next to him holding his gun in
place forcing peglum ahead of him
through the door and into a big black
muddy-fendered car that had been drawn
to the curb the gun prodded him into
the front seat the drivers seat

  you drive punk was the command

  peglum shook his head sorry he
lied glibly i dont know how to drive
a car

  a shrill horn sounded behind them at
some distance as some other car an-
nounced its drivers desire to pass them
on the narrow street peglums head
started to turn instinctively a little in
that direction then something exploded
against his head and there was nothing
but blackness in his mind

erica greshop was deeply angered
the deep luminous pools of her eyes
had grown black with anger

  she stood facing her father in silence
but he knew her thoughts and his usual-
ly stiff strong manner wilted under it

  she spoke slowly ignoring kurt still

  you dont she said need to ex-
plain it father ill do that now i
want kurt to know why im gone i
want him to know that i asked you and
that you agreed to tell him not to come
here that i despise him you prom-
ised that father and we made a com-
pact-which you broke youre afraid
of kurt faslon hes got something on
you-no keep still till i finish you
were going to sell me to him-not ob-
viously perhaps but it amounted to
that but i tell you now it wont do
i dont want kurt faslon at any price
youll not lean on me father if youve
gone soft ive not im going away and
let you face the music alone id have
stayed and fought with you but now you
have broken my faith in you and killed
my respect for you now see if you can
make it penetrate into kurts conceit
that i dont want him he is morally
distasteful and mentally uninteresting to
me make it clear to him i dont
want to be bothered again by him

  never once did she look at kurt fas-
lon never once did she betray by word
or glance that she even knew he was
there in the room while she discussed
him reviled him turning she walked
out of the study her head high
  and that was a tragic scene for even
as the little elevator dropped down its
shaft kurt faslon shot j louis gresh-
op and he died a tragic scene be-
cause it brought wholesale death and
slaughter and warfare into buttonville
a tragic scene because erica being right
had been wrong being strong had been
too strong being hurt had been with-
out understanding erica had lighted
the match with hard words the flame
seared her father the explosion shook
an entire state

  ericas rage endured as rage will
fanned by the wind of self-pity she
would go to europe-she had money of
her own that would punish him

  and the red and black coupe darting
out of the courtyard boomed across
the drawbridge nosed into the high-road
and grew into a blurred streak of red-
dish brown moving toward buttonville
at eighty miles an hour it was good to
feel the brakes grip the wheels slide
skid a little and slow the hurtling car
as she approached the red light at the
parkway and greshop boulevard gresh-
op boulevard why did her father
play this silly game what did he care
for buttonville they named streets
after him and made him president of the
chamber of commerce because he had
money and power but they hated him
greshop boulevard  what a mockery

just why it was she turned down high
street where the high hedge nearly
cut off all vision just before the bend
should bring her past the office of the
vigilante she did not quite know per-
haps it was her wondering about this
young hartness would he dare to fight
her fathers paper how would he do
it perhaps if she stopped a moment
and looked in-

  there was a large black limousine
very dirty parked in front of the vigi-
lante it crowded the road a man a
big-shouldered red-haired man was sil-
houetted against the bulk of the car
talking to a man in the drivers seat
erica sounded her horn slowed her car
then looked again it was strange but
there was now only one person in the
car-the red-haired man the other had
vanished and he-she had been quite
sure-had been peglum hartness

  then the limousine roared off   
and erica followed not knowing why-
out of impulse out of a sense that some-
thing was irregular out of curiosity
perhaps

  the black car ground to the boule-
vard doubled the corner picked up speed
even as it approached the center of town
blared its horn nosed in and around
frightened women drivers startled a pa-
trolman who barely leaped back into
safety after holding up his hand to stop
traffic and vanished down kalaramo
avenue while erica a more lawful driv-
er stayed behind at the frantic signal
of the furious officer no one in his
right mind dashes through a traffic po-
liceman nearly knocking him over and
scaring him out of his presence of mind
so that he misses catching even the li-
cense number no one except a fugi-
tive perhaps erica thought of that
she gripped her motionless wheel rigidly
impatient to be off in pursuit of the es-
caping car holding her breath biting her
lips then the officer waved her on and
the coupe leaped ahead

kalaramo avenue pours traffic into
the state highway toward the adi-
rondacks if the black car had taken that
direction erica was sure to catch it
she slipped her foot down bearing the
accelerator nearly to the floor the pow-
er-plant hummed malignantly snarled
and seemed to pluck the coupe from he
road and hurl it ahead eighty eighty-
five ninety-erica had never in her life
driven at such a speed the nerves at
her elbows seemed numb the wheels
caressed only the surface of the road
nearly leaving it to soar into space but
the heavy underslung body designed for
great speeds held fast and the red-and-
black coupe flowed like quicksilver past
the sluggish traffic of the outer road-
lane

  then she saw it it was only a speck
but she knew it the black limousine
was traveling fast-in the eighties yet
her speedster ate up the distances be-
tween them as though the bigger car
were stationary mustnt warn them
mustnt alarm them mustnt seem to
be pursuing better to lie back a little
and watch without being observed   

  and then suddenly the black limou-
sine vanished there had been just an
instant that the oncoming traffic crowd-
ed erica and drew her attention more
closely to her own immediate roadway
then when she looked up again the car
was gone she slowed down slid her car
back to forty miles an hour and coasted
half a mile farther there was a narrow
roadbed laid in with gravel but not yet
tarred and deep furrows showed that a
fast-moving car had recently slewed in-
to this cutting at a speed which was
greater than safety recommended erica
turned in and pushed down toward the
unknown

  head of her was only one double
furrow only one car had passed down
that road in some time she grew tense
excited she threw the low-hung ma-
chine around sharp curves skillfully
guessing her skidding distances and
shooting it ahead without having slowed
from her forty-mile pace the road
grew darker and it bit into a forest
she tried to guess her approximate lo-
cation but gave it up she tried to tell
herself that even if she had started this
mad chase on a mere hunch the fleeing
car had proved it was trying to avoid
her there must be something wrong

  and then there was a pop and some-
thing wrenched her front wheels snatch-
ing the steering-wheel almost out of her
hand she fought it she fought and
stood on the massive brakes and the
car like a bucking horse seemed to ca-
reen to lift up in the air and to settle
down between two great roadside trees
then there was concussion the tinkle
of glass a sense of pain all over and
then nothing

t isten chief somepins queer at

ii the vigilante office again it was

the voice of patrolman flynn speaking
to michael bender his captain from the
switchboard they put a call through

see and then i dont hear nothin but
a lot o talk in a room which i dont get
at all so i flash the central and she
tells me its the vigilante the phones
been off the hook fer a quarter of an hour
now thought maybe you better know

  that was it that was where ser-
geant case and two men got into the
black sedan and went down to the of-
fices of the newspaper which it seemed
had become so inextricably tangled with
the department a large arched truck
was standing in front of the driveway
its motor purring softly its driver smok-
ing a cigarette and two men in overalls
were laboriously pushing a heavy roll of
news-print up the incline of two-by-fours
to join other rolls already in the truck

  where you going with them rolls o
paper sergeant case demanded

  search me skipper ask the boss
inside

  the truck bore the label neatly paint-
ed of a canadian paper company the
license plate was canadian the truck-
men looked canadian there seemed
to be nothing wrong at all-except the
direction in which the rolls of paper were
moving paper decided sergeant case
should be moving into and not out of
the vigilante

  he walked into the office a man
stood there marking figures on a pad
wearing a brown derby smoking a cigar

  wheres hartness demanded case
what goes on here how come you
fellers are taking that paper away

peglum did not liear the care-
ful footsteps the voice was
startling in its suddenness
reach pal stick em up
the blue book magazine

  the man looked up

  its okay sergeant winkoe didnt
pay his bill we take back the paper
hartness has gone over to the agents at
the falls were only loading one truck
in case he gets a break hes going to
try to talk the office into leaving him
three rolls

  sounded right made sense couldnt
put your finger on anything wrong so
sergeant case merely said uh-huh
and then added

  who called headquarters on that
phone feller how come the receiver
was off the hook

  the man frowned then grinned
well he said that just happened
this hartness feller is pretty quick-
tempered he was plenty sore when i
came in and told him the glad news we
was gonna take away his stock he was
gonna phone you fellers to come down
and toss us out only i-well i sorta
talked him outa that idea i guess the
phone was just forgotten i hung it up
myself about a quarter-hour ago sorry
if it started things

  that sounded okay too you couldnt
do much about that you could just see
that hartness lad getting sore and may-
be getting ready to take a swing at the
brown derby then trying to get bender
on the wire sure that was it

  well said case get on with it im
gonna leave a man here so you dont
steal the whole joint on the kid

  okay sarge said the man thats
just dandy

  and case started back to his car he
strolled again to the big truck nodded
to the driver made a pretense of inspect-
ing the loading watched the men roll
one of the heavy drums into place ad-
mired their skill watched them go back
for the next one then he noticed a
bundle of newspapers wrapped around
what seemed to be a shapeless object
he touched it it was hard inside he
probed with his fingers they plucked at
something round and hard-came out
with a vegetable-ivory nut

 humph  said case aloud and
dropped the nut into his pocket

  then he detailed one of his men to
watch the loading mounted the sedan
and then drove away

back at headquarters sergeant case
was not sure of his story

  i tell yuh chief he said to cap-
tain bender i wouldnt have thought
nothing at all only fer pickin up this

  nut out of a bunch of newspaper wrap-
  pins everybody knows winkoe didnt
  have no money everybody knows he
  didnt have no credit after a while sure
  these guys might wanna get their paper
  back-must be over a thousand dollars
  worth of paper on that truck but what
  gets me is why do i find an ivory nut-
  a flock of em too-all hidden in an
  armful of old paper

    bender studied the nut it was a com-
  mon nut it was precisely like the tons
  and thousands of tons of nuts cut down
  from the phytelephas macrocarpa of the
  american indies and shipped to button-
  makers identical in every way  a
  round red spot was on the cheek of it as
  though stamped for some reason pos-
  sibly to signify a classification of size or
  quality it meant nothing it was only
  a nut millions of them could be found
  in the button-making factories which
  constituted buttonvilles industry

    all right said bender now get
  out get me a complete report cover-
  ing moores work over at winkoes flat
  a list of all the letters he found-finger-
  prints bills notes checks and all that
  i want that and i want you to draft a
  list of all the facts weve got on hart-
  ness brink and on greshop himself
  greshop you mean j louis
  nobody else get it put it in order
  bring it here now locate those feds
  and tell em i want em thats all
  it was all and it was largely bluff
  bender had already compiled his own
  list of the salient facts concerning win-
  koe and his contacts they got no-
  where they told nothing winkoe had
  not left buttonville since his arrival five
  years before when he was released from
  prison and came home to help his aged
  father there was no mystery about him
  save only one the source of his drugs
  -if indeed he took drugs that was
  another thing the autopsy on his body
  had revealed no actual symptoms of co-
  caine or other drug the effects of past
  use of these seemed to suggest them-
  selves but the coroner would swear to
  nothing and bender had only the re-
  port of the narcotic bureau men to show
  that winkoe was an addict

    all these things bender had and
  more his men had nearly taken apart
  the darkle family-the darkle tribe
  as they were locally known-and had
  found nothing except squalor drunken-
  ness and a family suffering from igno-
  rance and malnutrition he was and
  he knew it well stumped up a tree
  
murder comes to buttonville

but it was highly important not to con-
vey that knowledge to his men hence
the gruff commands to his sergeant

about three oclock mr paisley of
the federal narcotic bureau came
into benders office dangling his pipe
and wearing his odd half-smile

  howdy chief you wanted to see
us stones busy so i came along
whats up

  bender picked the vegetable-ivory nut
out of his drawer

  thats a common nut of the ivory
palm we use millions of them in but-
tonville its our trade and bread and
butter the guy who imports them all
is greshop-you know the rich wind-
bag who lives in an imported castle
down the road well this one was found
in a queer place there were more too
but weve got this i cant find any-
thing wrong with it you fellers are
scientific im not now suppose you
tell me

  tell you what

  whats different about that nut
paisley looked it over-moistened a
finger and rubbed on the red spot shook
it tapped it put it down then he picked
ittip again still silent pulled a jewelers
glass from his vest pocket and studied
it then he pocketed the nut asking
where dyou find it

  no chance paisley you tell me
whats queer and ill tell you where
the federal man thought a moment
then said

 there may be nothing probably
not i want to do a laboratory job on it
bender ill let you know so long
then he left and there was nothing
in his manner to show the excitement
within him nothing except perhaps his
eyes which no one of the force noticed
as paisley hurried through the hallway
and out to the street once outside
however his step quickened and he hur-
ried to his hotel room like a man antici-
pating a pleasure

  but all that escaped benders notice
and he glared at the door as the federal
man departed

  laboratory job huh what the hell
it aint chemicals snorted bender and
then his phone rang sharply

  hello    who what murder
whos murdered  greshop  you mean
j louis whos talking oh sankey
hey well well be right over

  j louis greshop murdered in his own
chateau first winkoe then that half-

wit now the towns leading citizen and
richest man trouble and more trouble
reporters from news-services would
come flocking-camera-men asking im-
pertinent questions questions he couldnt
answer

  this was a job to be handled person-
ally michael bender would like to
handle everything personally he was
a one-man force he only used his
twenty cops for the looks of the thing
couldnt trust them

  the police sedan was roaring down
the boulevard again bender sitting be-
side the chauffeur sergeant case and
three others behind father bender and
his choir-boys somebody had called them
once not a bad simile either

consciousness returned to peg-
lum bringing with it a sense of rapid
motion there was the soft purring of a
motor and the swish of air it grew into
his mind that he was in a car it came
to him that the darkness which sur-
rounded him was not night but rather
some cloth-stuff wrapped around his
head slowly he decided that it was a
coat or jacket or some other garment
because of the odor of tobacco which
lingered in it seconds passed before
he was able to decide that his cramped
feeling came from being bent over and
huddled in the front seat of an auto-
mobile and that the close warm-feeling
bulk near him was the body of a man
presumably the driver there was agony
in his head there was a moist sticki-
ness oozing into his eyes and feeling wet
on his face he sensed that this was
blood but his hands were free he
tried to heave himself up and straighten
out from his cramped position then
something struck him sharply across the
top of his head all but sending him back
into unconsciousness again from the
sheer pain of it and a voice snarled

  set still punk one funny move
outa you an yuh get the persuader
see 

  familiar voice familiar language
ah yes red dugalbs voice dugalb
and farjink ridiculously here in but-
tonville why why city gangsters
breaking into a jerkwater newspaper of-
fice in a little upstate town didnt fit

  then the brakes screamed then the
pull of centrifugal force suggested that
the car was making a rapid turn and
directly the road seemed to grow rough-
er as though they had left the highway
and were entering upon a dirt road of
dugalb grasping peglum
roughly ordered come
 youse get down   
step out keep yer mitts

up see

some sort perhaps this was dugalbs
plan run into the woods and- well
that wasnt very pleasant but dugalb
was doing something he seemed agi-
tated his movements were quick and
sudden it seemed to peglum that there
was barely audible the sound of another
motor behind them suddenly dugalb
jammed on the brake and peglum could
feel his body strain as though leaning
out then there was the crack of a re-
volver followed somewhere at the rear
by a smashing sound

  dugalb drove on chuckling

  after a short ride the car stopped and
dugalb called out loudly

  hey boss things is bust open i
hadda bring this mug along then
grasping peglum roughly and jerking at
him come on youse get down   
step out keep yer mitts up see

  and the authority of this command
was a hard round pressure which peg-
lum felt in his back he walked there
was a woodsy smell in the air blind-
folded he could only guess that the hard
cement steps led into a house there was
a whispered word impossible to grasp
then a door closed and the jacket was
snatched from his head

  okay mug said red dugalbs harsh
voice siddown an shuddup an maybe
youll stay healthy ill be waitin fer
you outside with a tommy gun if you
wanna try bustin out see



dugalb was backing away still fon-
dling his automatic as though it were a
sensitive part of him then he vanished
through a door closed it locked it loud-
ly and walked away peglum could
hear his heavy steps pounding the reso-
nant floor

it was better now being alone bet-
ter to think thinking was important
now scrambled facts things all piece-
meal now just try this brain-twister
mr hartness fold and cut on tfie
dotted line and put this puzzle to-
gether  city-gangsters plus a small-town
newspaper sold for practically nothing
plus two murders plus a keen-tongued
heiress trying to warn you about some-
thing plus this lawyer brink warning
you again add that up and what do
you get nothing nothing at all-yet
something queer something-

  a key rattled and the door squeaked
open and a mans figure stood framed
in the panel of brighter light

  hello said the man and the voice
was unbelievable because it was tom
brinks voice hello he said drawl-
ingly just fancy meeting you here eh

peglum stared and was hardly able

to say

  good god they got you too

  brink took a long pull on his cigarette
shaking his head

  not exactly this happens to be my
cottage

  then what the hell-

  it must seem rather baffling to you
hartness theres an element of humor
in the situation

  yeah well im plenty ready to
laugh but id like to know the joke
right now it looks as if its on me
  brink nodded thats right it is
peglums head cleared and gave him
a sudden flash of penetration

  well well mr bones he said with
rasping irony would you be the big
bad villain of this picture after all
brink grinned dont get worked up
over it he said im not really the
star you know not the prize villain
crook eh

  not a nice word hartness come
now i like you lets be pally ive
warned you once that youre poking
your head into trouble i didnt have to
what i ought to do now is to let red
shoot you he gets a real kick out of a
neat well-done murder i ought to hand
you over and forget you but-well
there is still something of the old senti-
mentality left in me i guess

ut the comedy brink peglum

  snapped what are you after at

the vigilante the nuts in those fake
paper rolls

  of course

 why

  brink grinned again what a news-
paper story it would make hartness
those nuts are shipped from the west
indies to buttonville-innocent simple
profitable stuff hey well feller about
one carload out of every five of those
nuts is queer

  queer 

  yes theres a plugged hole in each
one of them it holds a bottle with an
ounce of cocaine hydrochlorate in it its
the greatest smuggling trick on record
hartness i wish id thought of it my-
self but i didnt so i did the next best
thing i stole em

  peglum stopped him

  wait now he said wait and let
me get it straight youre telling me
that ive stuck my face into a dope-
smuggling mess who for gods sake
winkoe

  brink shook his head

  no poor winkoe was only a fall guy
the big shot who organized the great-
est cocaine-running outfit in the world
is the noble public-spirited citizen j
louis greshop

  greshop

  thats the feller

  and you

  me im the fly in his ointment
he hires me to be transit-man for his
shipments around the country from here
but i know a better trick than that   
ive got about a million dollars in

  greshops cocaine hidden away in the
  vigilantes cellar im taking it out to-
  day-thats what those men were doing
  everybodys double-crossing greshop i
  have to act fast or else the new york
  crowd are ready to run him out-

    the door burst open then and pierc-
  ing screams sounded as red dugalb
  came in carrying a kicking fighting
  screaming girl in his arms as they
  stepped through the girl interrupted her
  screaming long enough to sink her teeth
  suddenly and violently into the mans
  hand as he released the doorknob and
  tried to take a new hold on her his big
  hand descended violently and struck her
  across the face jerking her head back
  sickeningly and bringing peglum to his
  toes with rage

    brink said what the-

     dugalb let the girl slip limply to the
  floor and backed away from her al-
  though she was too dazed from the blow
  to fight now

    gees boss she damned near kilt me
  she was in a car followin us see so
  i plugged her tires and crashed her
  when i went over fer a look she climbed
  me frame honest she did boss hell
  i never seen such a twist

    but neither brink nor peglum was
  listening their eyes were wide and
  fastened upon the girl who was slowly
  struggling to a sitting position on the
  floor peglum was the first to speak
  erica he gasped

    then he snatched her up in his arms

  the modern industrial town of but-
  tonville has the distinction of being a
  port on a barge canal this was not
  always so this distinction dates mere-
  ly from the advent of that public-spirited
  citizen j louis greshop whose in-
  fluence political and financial was suffi-
  cient to cause the construction of an
  entire new arm of the canal which
  brought the lock into buttonville with
  the lock naturally is a basin or depot
  and it is there that twice weekly the
  twelve-barge shipment of vegetable-ivory
  nuts is brought to feed the waiting mills
  of the town

    at four-thirty the telegrapher in the
  little coop at the basin office recorded a
  message from up the canal confirming
  for the third time the starting time of
  the barges at four-forty another mes-
  sage came through from the next basin
  town to buttonville that the chain of
  barges had passed through and should if
  all went well arrive in buttonville with-
  
the blue book magazine

in the hour and at five oclock a fleet
of trucks had begun to assemble await-
ing the barges and their ivory nuts ready
to cart them away to the factories

  it was toward five-thirty perhaps a
few minutes before when the crowd
which had gathered as usual to watch
the rather fascinating performance of
unloading heard first two distant cracks
or explosions then a distant spluttering
or chattering then there was the roar
of a powerful motor and a hydroplane
came whipping down the canal at a ter-
rific speed broadsided to a skidding
stop nosed perilously alongside the ma-
sonry of the lock and paused there while
a man stood up in her and fired a re-
volver into the air then the roar of the
motor and the churning of white foam
sent the scudding craft back down the
canal and out of sight around the bend

  the effect of those revolver-shots was
extraordinary two trucks at the head
of the waiting line spun their motors
rifle-barrels bristled from small in-
cisions in their high walls a man with
a machine-gun appeared at the rear of
each and another such formidable pair
of weapons leveled themselves at the
crowd as the two trucks charged into the
open cement runway nearly running
down the astonished pedestrians and
presently they were out of sight behind
the straggling trees and only the roar
of their motors could be heard fading
slowly fading and dying

  said the crowd one to another

 good god what can that be i
never heard of such a thing

even in the twentieth century there
is something to be said for a moat
drawbridge and portcullis if you want
to keep people effectively out of your
house true enough an ordinary field-
piece would blow your drawbridge and
portcullis to bits in a couple of rounds
but you hardly expect your unwanted
guests to carry field-artillery in their
pockets thus a closed drawbridge over
a deep wet moat is a most disconcert-
ing obstacle to a fast-moving automobile

  and so proved the moat the draw-
bridge and portcullis of the imported
chateau of j louis greshop when the
speeding police car roared down the
driveway and barely was able to bring
itself to a screaming stop at the brink of
the moat where the bridge was lifted
leaving a gap of fifty feet of deep
mucky and very cold water between the
police and the chateau

  captain michael bender swore in his
entire career he had never before en-
countered a moat or a drawbridge

  it was sergeant who ventured the sug-
gestion 

  yell never get in there at all chief
he said with truth if theres a stiff it
can wait im thinkin theres other
things goin on that we ought to take a
look at im still wonderin about them
trucks i saw at the vigilante

  captain michael bender swore again
but he knew case was right

  shawn he said to one of the pa-
trolmen stay here and watch let no-
body in or out if theres anything that
is queer telephone if theres nothing at
all within an hour telephone anyhow
shawn got down and took a position
under the south pylon where the shorn-
away part of the bridge still rested
bender watched him establish himself
then the car drove away he was a very
troubled very unhappy man

back at headquarters there was more
trouble waiting in the private office
was the patrolman who acted as clerk
holding a voluminous dossier of papers
a small black handbag and divers other
incidentals	

  heres the whole collection of stuff
from winkoes flat chief ive been
waiting for you theres nothing very
much really except he had a ticket
voucher for a passage on a steamer for
the west indies sailing tomorrow
tomorrows saturday

  thats right she sails at seven p m
stops at inagua port-au-prince cap-
haitien petit goave puerto cabello and
curagao then back again his ticket
only read as far as the haiti ports as
best i could make out it wasnt paid
for yet-just a reservation-voucher
that might account for his wanting
hartness check dated saturday that
check ever turned up yet  did you fol-
low up with the bank

  not a sign of it

  what else in winkoes flat

  just junk i wouldnt try to call it
anything chief maybe you can get
something out of it

  but bender was not long to have the
privilege of quietly musing over his
puzzle his door opened the suave
tweed-clad figure of paisley the narcotic
bureau man sauntered in hands in his
pockets pipe dangling from his mouth

  hello he said genially but the
twinkle in his eye told bender that this
murder comes to buttonville

was no mere social visit caught your
murderer 

  no admitted bender not yet
well maybe ive got something
then

  shoot 

  paisley sat uninvited in a stiff-backed
chair puffed thoughtfully then said
that ivory nut you gave me bender
-quite interesting solves my problem
altogether maybe it casts a light on
yours too

  well 

  well i x-rayed it it had a one-inch
hole bored in it and a neatly fitted screw-
plug that turns flush with the surface
the hole holds a bottle the bottle is
filled with cocaine

  no

  yes sir hydrochlorate of coca-
right from cuba

  but that means-

  exactly bender we know who im-
ports vegetable ivory-as a monopoly
his name is greshop-your local mil-
lionaire

  the hell you say

  i do say it weve suspected greshop
for years weve worked from the new
york end-a slick lad named kurt
faslon is the outlet-and weve traced
shipments to this town we didnt know
how they got in thats all now its
clear where did you find this nut
thats the queerest part of it it
was on a truck belonging to a paper
company and they were loading in a
flock of news-print from winkoes vigi-
lante said he couldnt pay

paisley was puzzled i dont quite
get the picture yet he admitted
but well figure it out im wondering
where your friend brink comes in
tom brink hes all right

  yes how would you like to know
that your all-right tom brink used to
be the most powerful beer racketeer in
the business tom brink is legs
brinkherhalt the chicago-

  the hell he is brinkherhalt is dead
everybody knows that he got his in
the fourth of july massacre when pe-
rones crowd machine-gunned a car full
of them

  thats what you think the fact is
that it was a double who was killed for
brinkherhalt legs himself wasnt even
in the city hes pulled the cleverest
game of faked identity on record had
his face altered and his finger-tips graft-
ed with new skin

  bender shook his head violently

  i dont believe it he said ive
known brink as a lawyer right here in
buttonville for six years damned good
lawyer and a good sound man little
hard-boiled maybe but not a crook
no howd you like to know that
brinks lawyer pose was a cover for his
job of routing cocaine for greshops out-
fit howd you like toknow that ralph
stone has been working as a truckman
for brink since last year  got hundreds
of snapshots of him stones a clever
sculptor-identity sculptor not an artist
he noticed brinks fingers were queer
and saw a couple of scars on his face
that might be a lifting job he sent his
photos and his plastic work to washing-
ton and we just got a wire confirming it
that brink is brinkherhalt

  wh-e-e-e-ew whistled bender
and that isnt all brinkherhalt was
a lawyer-before he went bad had a
fine practice until a perone bought him
for a mouthpiece he got into a fancy
jam and got disbarred as well as ar-
rested for obstructing justice for perjury
and god knows what else that ruined
him

  god paisley first greshop now tom
brink youll tell me winkoe was in it
too in a minute

  he was in a way he did the plas-
tic surgery on brinkherhalt i cant
prove it but we do know they were in
prison together winkoe once was very
clever what i dont see yet is those
nuts being in the vigilantes cellar of
course the paper-truck was phony-thats
one of brinks trucks

  brinks how come

  stone is working on it but i still
dont figure-

  the sentence was cut off by a loud
ringing of the desk phone it was the
switchboard office inside

  chief a voice said excitedly hells
bust loose in town over by the canal
scarpatti pulled the riot hook its down
near the viaduct somewhere on the high-
way i cant understand what scarpat-
tis trying to say on the wire-he sounds
crazy but theres some shooting going
on and maybe youd better-

  but bender was already in action

tom brink lawyer shot his hand into
his jacket pocket lifted it slightly
and sent a revolver-shot crashing into the
amazed and unsuspecting red dugalb
brink had said not one word his eyes
had grown suddenly hard and cold he
shot watched his man stare then gasp
in a hurt voice

  gees boss-i didnt mean-oh gees
boss-

  then red dugalb was dead

  im very sorry miss greshop said
brink i assure you this wasnt a part
of my plans

erica shook her head as though a
mist were forming over her eyes and
she would shake it away

 you-you killed him she man-
aged to say you murdered him  
dopt let it trouble you he was a
killer let me offer you my apologies
for his stupidity it wont happen again
-as you can see

  put me down put me down this
to peglum who still held hef a little
stupefied at the quickness and the cold
brutality of dugalbs death he let her
down she stiffened then she whirled
at peglum

  so-youre one of them are you
then my father was right

  not so fast miss greshop brink
broke in hes not the villain in this
scene i am mr hartness is by way
of being my prisoner im afraid youre
in the same position for the moment be
assured that youre quite safe-quite
her eyes snapped youre a man
named brink my father knows youre
a crook whats your game

  brink grinned broadly and bowed
your father should know miss greshop
im on his pay-roll

  stop it brink peglum was bris-
tling theres no need to humiliate her 
he might have said more had not
there sounded a disturbance outside a
shot crashed then another the roar
of an automobile motor then five more
shots rapidly

  brink sprang to the door flung it open
swore venomously leveled his automatic
and at that instant peglum leaped upon
him the gun roared but peglums body
had hurled brink into the door-jamb
they crashed together peglum reach-
ing for the mans gun a fist crashed
into his face a knee shot pain into his
groin but he clung on peglum slugged
with all his power but brinks head
butted forward striking peglum full be-
tween the eyes blinding him benumb-
ing him his fingers lost their grip on
the gun  it would only be seconds
now peglum waited for the shot-wait-
ed-waited and then brinks body
went limp

brink sprang to the door flung it

  there was a scream another voice
calling a shot sounded-not near but
in the room hands were touching him
strong arms were lifting him gradually
the light grew brighter surer

  thank god   said a voice

  he looked up into the eyes of erica
greshop a man stood behind her with
an automatic-a man in overalls brink
lay on the floor bleeding badly from a
gash in his head and a bright red patch
that was seeping through his jacket

  thanks peglum said then to the
stranger i suppose i owe you my life
if youd tell me who you are-

  im ralph stone federal bureau-
but i didnt do it youve got miss
greshop to thank

federal man eh then you know
about the cocaine yes i know
ive been on this case for five years
erica interrupted her face had been
strained and frightened staring at the
open leveled liis automatic and at tliat instant peglnni leaped upon him

prone body of brink now she said
slowlv tensely

  i-i-killed him

  peglum noticed then that there was a
students lamp with a flexible stem
dangling from ericas hand it was a
terrible weapon he moved toward her
reached for her hand would have said
some word of reassurance to her but
brinks lips gave a low groan

  i doubt it miss greshop said the
federal man if he dies it was my
shot that finished him but i doubt if he
dies that kind are tenacious of life
brink groaned again stone leaned
over him the wounded mans eyes
opened he whispered

  its you-double-crosser eh

  in a way yes stone replied wash-
ington has another name for it though
brink sat up slowly staring

  federal bureau he queried and
then as though he had answered his own

question his grin fought the expression
of pain in his face he laughed

  thats the funniest thing ive heard
since i was in short pants and the
jokes on me i hired you myself i
hired you on account you were a damned
good truck-driver well now you got
what you wanted g-man what about
greshop that fat-

stones hand covered brinks mouth
well talk about that later he said
but erica had heard the name

 you mean-pops-my foster-father
is a crook you mean hes in some-
some racket come tell me i have a
right to know ive suspected him of
something tell me tell me i must
know 

  she ran to stone and gripped his arm
peglum again followed her and tried to
lead her gently away but she fought
him off crying


 ran away with the money to america
 and he built up quite a fortune out of
 which he replaced the money he had
 stolen you see he wasnt all bad-as
 you say we believe it was one of your
 -your foster-fathers associates who in-
 spired the use of his vegetable ivory
 monopoly as a guise for importing co-
 caine-

   kurt faslon

   stone seemed a little surprised but
 nodded

   yes it was faslon-or so we think
 hes not the up-and-coming young man
 he appears youve guessed that youve
 had trouble with kurt

dont let go
brink peglum
called dont give
up-well get you
to a hospital-

  i want to know about him i must
know about him i dont care what it
is i must know do you hear

  brink grinned better tell her shell
learn soon enough

  and ralph stone quietly told her in
as few simple words as he was able

there was a moment of silence then
erica said slowly

  poor pops you will never believe
this mr stone but louis greshop who
is not really my father but my foster-
father is not a bad man weak yes
a money-power madness drove him
it is a disease with him but he
isnt bad-not really i cant feel
about him as i would my own father
perhaps-

  i didnt know that he was your fos-
ter-father stone said that will make
it easier-other things i mean

  erica stiffened

  can there be anything else tell me
now-

  im afraid so louis greshop has
quite a record-a very curious one in
the first place he is not an american
not an american

  no he is haitian-born

 you mean-

  in a very distant sense yes he is
the son of a very distinguished family
his name is not actually greshop his
family were bankers and when he was
quite young he stole a considerable sum
from their bank in port-au-prince he

  call it that he wanted to marry
me i-	

  brink groaned then it was startling
unreal horrible the wounded fellow
jerked himself erect stifled his lips with
his hand and then tried to grin

  wait-a minute folks he said halt-
ingly me ive got a few words-want
to say em before- the grin froze
he clenched his fist in a swift convulsion

  listen this is for-miss greshop-
dont care about-rest maybe you can
-save greshop-if you hurry theyre
double-crossing him    everybody
double-crosses everybody else-in this
racket    me i tried too now im
finish-fin-ish-

  peglum caught brinks body in his
arms lifted his head up urged him
dont let go brink-dont give up
well get you to a hospital-

  the eyes opened the grin came back
what for the lips asked dont
be funny-hartness listen-dont talk
listen give you-newspaper story-
best story ever    couldnt guess who
i am-thats-story-tell you    im
brinker-

  then he died his voice faded as he
died and he did not tell his story
peglum let him down

  im sorry he said aloud i liked
him it was hard to believe he was a


crook a killer i wonder what he was
trying to tell me

  stone said i think i know those
scars on his face-there by the neck-
and those queer finger-tips are conceal-
ing an identity never mind now wed
better hurry brinks car is behind this
cottage come we may have a chance
to-well to save your foster-fathers life
miss greshop

  and they left the cottage to its dead
the car was easily commandeered
they nosed out through the dirt path
and into the highway the barge canal
following the lowland bends and turns
and plays tag with the highway all the
many miles to buttonville at a point
some two or three miles out of button-
ville itself the canal makes a horse-shoe
curve and passes under a viaduct which
leads the highway into the town

  it was just as the bridge came into
view of the speeding car that the noise
came upon them it was a distant
chattering as though a number of pneu-
matic drills were busy but when this
was punctuated by short sharp explo-
sions an utter bedlam let loose ahead
of them by the bridge

  stone was driving he jerked the car
tothe side of the road and ground to a
stop

  thats bad he said im afraid
were too late miss greshop if theyve
started fighting then your foster father
is a dead man they wouldnt try it-
a hole appeared in the windshield they
all crouched on the floor

  those are tommy guns and auto-
matics this is the day a big shipment
was due we-that is brink-suspected
that faslon would raid them on the out-
going shipment and take over he must
have changed his plans it was planned
for tuesday brink wanted to act first
ive got to get into this hartness you
drive miss greshop back and ill stay
here-

  before peglum could nod agreement
stone had dropped down to the road
and was darting off into the bushes to
erica peglum snapped

  down on the floor here we go-
and he threw the car in gear to whirl
down upon the bullet-sprayed road

as they approached the bridge the
 meaning of stones words became
clearer the long low shadow which
had seemed crawling down the canal took
the form of a procession of barges with
the heavy black smoke of the tug pull-

ing them wrapped around them like
misty silk this procession was half-
way under the bridge on the bridge
was a heavy enclosed truck a battery
of machine-guns was pouring lead down
upon the barges and tug while another
motor-van was roaring down the tow-
path spraying lead upon the flank of the
boats

  a spent bullet rjcocheted against the
steel top of the car and peglum veered
still another and another spattered he
stopped sharply

  erica- you all right

  her voice was muffled but sure
yes she said but you arent
huh why what do you mean
youre a newspaper man arent you
isnt this the big story what are you
going to use for money to run the vigi-
lante never mind me i can drive this
car as well as you can you get out
and get a story ill get home on a wood
road that i know or are you afraid-
peglum glared over the top of the
seat

  then he got down silently

  take it he said then he dashed
into the brush at the roadside

in the new york office of the abc
news syndicate the hours between
two-thirty and seven pm are generally
rather dull the desk men are clicking
regularly on their machines pounding out
a few routine bits of copy to prepare the
telegraph desk for its evenings rush
editor milt barnes is able with his door
safely closed to spend a brief half-hour
with his feet on the desk his soul in the
arms of morpheus-as he was doing now

  then the telephone on the desk of edi-
tor barnes rang barnes blinked stared
wildly then obeyed his natural reflexes

  yes he spat crisply into the mouth-
piece barnes talking

  barnes came a voice this is peg
hartness remember me

  hartness ah yes youre the bright
boy who wanted to run a series of strike
articles some years ago and i had to let

sand dollars advance by wire contract for
the abc service for one year and an

agreement about that county deal ill
give you half an hour barnes then ill
sell to somebody else

  you damned robber i-

  send the wire to me editor of the
buttonville vigilante buttonville ny
remember me barnes this is hart-
ness speaking bright boy hartness the
youngster you fired because he had ideas
and that was that

that evening at about six-thirty
every metropolitan evening newspa-
per in the united states was sending an
army of criers into the street screaming
wuxtra wuxtra wuxtra allabout big
dope-ring bust-up 

  in every newspaper belonging to the
abc syndicate-four hundred papers
with a circulation of over three million
readers-the story broke simultaneous-
ly it blazed over the country it
shocked good citizens into indignation
it startled bad ones into a greater respect
for the power of law and order but
greatest of all its triumphs was the lifting
up of an obscure little weekly newspaper
the buttonville vigilante with its un-
heard-of editor and publisher out of dim
oblivion into overnight fame

  and yet when the first days smske
had cleared away editor barnes of the
abc bureau was not satisfied he
sensed somehow that he had been cheat-
ed he did not therefore send forward
the balance of the thousand dollars for
which he had contracted the story why 
for a most curious reason

  let us then examine this world-stir-
ring story a typical headline was car-
ried over four columns on the new york
papers front page reading

shots fly  dead as gang
warfare along barge canal
breaks gigantic dope rings
million-dollar shipment

  there were others and various but this
is typical some indeed underscored the
revelation of a known millionaire philan-
thropist as organizer and head of this
criminal ring still others blazed out the
discovery of the dead brinkherhalt
noted public enemy of the prohibition re-
gime alive and actively involved in this
cocaine-shipping syndicate still others
played up the angle of the decoy-ship-
ment of ivory nuts which so successfully
camouflaged the actual delivery of the
illicit drug into the country while still
others in their headlines did a nice pro-
fessional bit of flag-waving lauded the
murder comes to buttonville

federal bureau and blazed away at
public sentiment

  but though the headlines differed the
story was inevitably the same under
the by-line of one peglum hartness edi-
tor-publisher of the vigilante button-
ville new york and special eyewitness
reporter to the abc news syndicate
the lead was a masterpiece of thrill-get-
ting copy which read

    buttonville n y july -while
  truck motors roared machine-guns chat-
  tered bullets whistled and a state high-
  way resounded with the screams of fright-
  ened or wounded men and women and
  children the largest narcotic ring in the
  history of organized crime was ushered out
  of existence marking a victory for us
  federal bureau men after a five-year cam-
  paign to run illicit cocaine and its traffickers
  out of the country your reporter stand-
  ing underneath the bridge where a hail of
  bullets marked the three-sided battle be-
  tween the guards of the barges and the two
  double-crossing factions witnessed one of
  the most bewildering sights of his career
  when it became evident that the forces of
  law and order were taking part the three
  embattled gangs joined together precipi-
  ting a pitched battle between crime and
  anti-crime first the local force from but-
  tonville some twelve burly policemen
  under the direction of captain michael
  bender attacked with machine-guns gas-
  bombs and shotguns but these were out-
  numbered and no fewer than seven were
  wounded before the state troopers arriv-
  ing in three vans took hand-

so ran the story not a detail was
missed from the strange ascent of
millionaire greshop the insane power-
jealousy of his right-hand man kurt fas-
lon who murdered him and was in turn
murdered by the butler sankey his body
hurled from a window to the swash-
buckling legs brinkherhalt alias tom
brink and his hoarding of high-jacked
containers of the precious cocaine in win-
koes newspaper cellar-the whole chain
of fantastic happenings and revelations
marched down the blistering columns it
was a story dripping with color reeking
with the smell of powder sparkling with
every element of thrill mystery and tri-
umph of the law that goes to make a
piece of fact infinitely stranger than
fiction

  but in the mind of editor barnes this
was not enough

  the hiatus was discovered not by edi-
tor barnes himself which would have

been bad enough but by no lesser indi-
vidual than h leroy packard founder
and president of the abc and one of
the major furies when his ire was
aroused h leroy packard had been on
a vacation h leroy packard a man of
sixty-two and successful only after long
struggling years loved fishing he had
gone it seemed to a small island in the
atlantic off the coast of massachusetts
there to forget news and newspapers for
a week or so and to catch large marlin
or swordfish so delighted was editor
barnes with this world-beating scoop
which he had purchased during his em-
ployers absence that he went to the
length of causing a selection of new york
papers carrying the story to be flown by
special plane to mr packards island be-
lieving that a bit of showmanship with
the boss is never amiss

  but editor barnes erred gravely

about one am his telephone rang

 after his weary head had been pil-
lowed for an hour or so the voice on
the wire belonged to h leroy packard
and it was raucous with anger

  who the hell is this guy hartness
was the question and after a brief an-
swer had been given mr packard went
on to say

  doesnt anybody on my blankety-
blank news-service staff know the funda-
mentals of news my god barnes i pay
you more than any city man in the busi-
ness and you pay for two big stories and
only use one

  two stories

  yes two you got a hot tip hey
you thought you were smart hey so
you let somebody sell you a dope-ring
yarn with a lot of trimmings and right
in the middle of that yarn is another-a
ripsnorting human old-fashioned sher-
lock holmes detective mystery that you
couldnt land in a hundred years if it
wasnt made to order and you never
saw it barnes you dont even know
what im talking about

  im afraid i dont-

  of course you dont well who killed
peter winkoe who killed his half-wit
printers devil theres your big yarn
barnes we want a solution to those
murders the public wants it you get
that solution barnes or you get another
job my god you wouldnt know a real
story if it spit in your face how-come i
ever put you in charge of that office any-
how you go trade a story for the
abc service and get our sales depart-


ment sore and tangled up and then you
muff the best part of your trade you
get that winkoe story barnes or dont
come back to the office ill give you
twelve hours

  and the crash over the wire told editor
barnes that that was an ultimatum he
sat up in bed swearing after ten min-
utes he crawled out of bed still swearing
after fifteen minutes more he did what
a large number of executives would do-
passed the buck by a telegram addressed
to peglum hartness at the vigilante
buttonville n y the wire read

  how come you hold out winkoe murder
  solution stop you get complete story
  on winkoe and darkle murders by four
  pm or forget about abc service stop
  who said you were a newspaper man
  barnes abc syndicate

erica greshop sat staring white-
faced at the great full-length por-
trait of her foster-father which hung in
the chateaus vast library it was already
broad daylight but the light still burned
all night she had been sitting there it
was as though she might read somehow
in those painted features the softness the
companionship the goodness which she
had known in a man now dead and whom
society had already and soon stamped
with shame

  she was alone trying to reason trying
to plan trying to grasp and comprehend
not weeping erica was too strong

  it was eight-thirty in the morning the
telephone rang loudly she rebelled  she
would not answer it no she had had
enough there would be reporters and
camera-men and more policemen let
them come to her not telephone a man
had been killed his very name was dead
and strewn in the ashes-and they tele-
phoned 

  but her anger was a purge to her soul
now the tears poured over her face and
she sank down in a silk-clad heap on
the rug sobbing it was hard for erica
to cry there had been few tears in her
life and as she glutted her nerves with
this great panacea she did not hear the
ringing of the great gong which served to
announce a visitor at the bronze portal
erica miss greshop 

  the voice came upon running foot-
steps a mans voice a strong heavy
step miss greshop-good god-

  she looked up into the eyes of peglum
hartness why was he here couldnt
they leave her alone

  forgive me hartness began i
shouldnt have come bursting in like this
but i rang and rang and nobody an-
swered

  servants have all-gone she faltered
they-they quit

e caught her helplessness

is there-anything- she began
she meant of course what do you want
with me  why cant i be let alone 
yes peglum said but-i dont
know i know what you must be going
through i didnt mean to-

  what is it

  well ive been at headquarters
all morning-since five-thirty this morn-

got to get a solution for the evening pa-
pers or else they routed me out with

ly you cant really remember anything
about that gun

  she shook her head

  im terribly sorry she said but
i havent even seen it in years thats all
i can say

  oh said peglum well i guess that
settles it thanks though ill run along
darkle screaming- flung him-
self upon peglums neck pound-
ing gouging clawing calling
hey hey-theyre ti-yin to
frame me

-got to do something there are about
a hundred reporters from all the papers
you can think of in town already youll
have them out here before long ive got
to get a jump on them thanks-erica

recollection came to erica about two
 oclock that afternoon it had been
a harrowing day the press had come
to the chateau the press had all but
absorbed the chateau it was the press
which was responsible for ericas sudden
remembrance rude they were-rude
and brutal and aggravating how much
of this crooked money did your-did
greshop give to charity that was a
question what are you going to do
with your own money now that you
know where it came from  there was
another and  did you know that every
gram of cocaine sold illicitly is worth
fifty bundles of clothes handed out by the
red cross and other organizations like
that youve got a grand chance to make
a gesture miss greshop that was the

worst of all that mans whole manner
was a sneer she had left them then
left and went upstairs and locked herself
in her own apartment and flung herself
on the bed

  then the memory came charities-
money-bundles of clothes- sugges-
tive words those call him a crook call
him what you please but he gave gener-
ously think of the good works he had
done right there in buttonville-and no
publicity nothing obvious almost every
week he had sent clothes and food to
needy people sankey had charge of that
why that very darkle family-

  and then she remembered that would
be it of course that must be it she
would have to get away from the report-
ers she would have to sneak out that
would be easy there were half a dozen
secret passages doors concealed gates
all leading into the courtyard if she
could only get across the bridge-

  she managed it somehow she could
hear the reporters calling for her shout-
the blue book magazine

ing threatening their petty blackmail
demanding their interviews storming and
fuming and running through the maze of
corridors she could hear them but they
couldnt see her they only saw her car
heard it roaring over the bridge let
them follow her if they could

it took fully seven minutes fast driv-
ing to get into buttonville and another
five minutes to work through traffic to the
municipal hall and the police head-
quarters the police were considerate

  you wish to speak with sankey  its
a little irregular miss greshop but it
can be arranged if youll wait a mo-
ment ill try-

  sankey sat alone in his cell dejectedly
his head hanging when erica came in
he stood up stiffly habit was strong on
him

  good afternoon miss erica he said
bravely and then  a terrible thing miss
a most awful thing indeed miss i
shouldnt wonder if i were to go to the
chair for it too but i couldnt see that
-that kurt person miss-kill the master
and do nothing about it its good to see
you miss are the servants doing well
for you in this time of your trouble
ericas smile was ironical

  theyve all quit sankey she said
but added as she saw the shocked conster-
nation on his face but never mind it
doesnt matter i shant need them any
more im not going to live that way
im giving up all my money sankey im
going to take a job-

  good grief miss you cant mean
it

  i do mean it sankey  but what i came
for is quite different do you remember
the time you sent a large bundle of things
over to the darkles-that poor family-
quite miss i recall it very well i
remember the old fellow-a very dis-
agreeable sort he was too

  he would be but do you remember
what was in those things clothes-old
suits of pops food-a fish-pole i think
and a reel-things mr greshop had re-
placed i remember there was some talk
about helping the old fellow-

  quite miss i remember it well
well- how she hated to ask this
well sankey that little pistol of mine-
the one i got in boston was that with
those things did you send it along be-
cause it was near the fourth of july last
year-with some blanks

  indeed i did miss i remember dis-
tinctly- my god 

  the exclamation was a natural thing
for sankey had scarcely formed his af-
firmative before erica had so far forgot-
ten her dignity of an employer to a serv-
ant as to throw her arms around the man
and kiss him quickly upon the brow
then she dashed from his cell all but
knocking the guard over in her flight and
fairly flew out of the police station

  the coupes motor could still roar
though the sprightly body was badly bent
and battered from its smash into the tree
on the previous day but roar it could
and it roared down greshop boulevard to
high street

  peglum hartness was slouched at his
new though now useless editorial desk
watching sadly the minutes tick away on
the wall clock filled with dejection even
the bursting open of his outer door scarce-
ly aroused him but when a cyclone in
silk swept into the editorial office and an
excited voice called out

  peg-hurry-come on-ive got it
  he stared up at erica

  what  what have you got 

  the murderer you fool come on  
that was the electric word it didnt
matter that there was no proof they be-
lieved it and as the car sped breaking
all traffic laws to the dump heap whsre
the darkle tribe had its dwelling-as they
sped so this belief grew and waxed and
made them glad they had to be right
there was no other way possible

old darkle wasnt dead he was
breathing perhaps he was drunk
you go back to the car erica peg-
lum told the girl this is no place for
you anything can happen here this
is nothing less than a hobo jungle god
knows what were up against

  ill stay said erica quietly im
in this

  there was no discussion you cant
argue with a girl like that

  aw let the poor devil alone some-
body called let a man sleep it off if
he gits drunk whats it to ye

  there were more similar remarks peg-
lum ignored them and shook the prone
form of old darkle

  hey get up you hey darkle get up
and have a drink

  magic words the body stirred the
washed-out eyes opened halfway

 whacha want leme alone wat
say bout a drink hey

  get up ill buy you a drink you
come along with me-

  naw i aint movin
murder comes to buttonville

    frozen stubbornness    erica drew
 peglum aside whispered

   did you look at whats under that
 awful bed

   he shook his head then he leaned
 down and peered scarcely had he done
 so before the prone figure of darkle came
 violently to life

   hey you- and screaming words
 unprintable he flung himself upon peg-
 lums neck pounding gouging clawing
 calling out for help hey hey hey-
 theyre tryin to frame me

   and the door burst in with a flood of
 menacing evil-faced men and women

   peglum fought erica screamed backed
 across the room staring at the advanc-
 ing shouting clamoring mob peglum
 had the old man of the sea clinging to
 his neck and shoulders peglum plunged
 into the wall dashing darkle against it
 breaking his frantic hold finally shak-
 ing him to the floor screaming insanely
 then the mob charged a score of fists
 seemed to drive at peglum together he
 was down    he was up again swing-
 ing and fighting and flailing down
 again feet were trampling him hands
 were tearing at his hair he heard erica
 scream in mortal terror he got to his
  knees then a heavy shoe smashed
 against the point of his jaw   

    he looked up into the face of sergeant
 case

    sure yere a sucker fer trouble hart-
 ness now what in hell would ye be doin
 here and the girl with ye too

   what was it there had been a rea-
 son peglum tried to remember erica
 had brought him about a pistol that
 was it something else something un-
 der the bed- what was it

    look there he managed to say point-
 ing weakly look under the bed
 case bent over and looked it had
 rolled farther back now but it was still
 there-a little gray-white ivory nut with
 a red circle clearly visible

   thats it said peglum that does
 it it all ties in now take darkle
 along-hes your murderer how did you
 ever think of coming here

   sure when ye break all the laws of
 speed and traffic and nearly kill a hand-
 ful of citizens dye think we wouldnt
 notice ye whoop-there ye go again
 for peglum had sunk back and closed
 his eyes

blue cloud of tobacco fumes a red-

and found myself in a gathering of
anciens of the foreign legion corri-
gan whom i knew rather well intro-
duced me to the gang as one who might
be termed a friend if not a brother and
the talk went on it was raucous and
impolite

  wetzler stood up liquor banishing the
pallor of his faded lined cheeks and
raised his glass

  clink your glasses comrades-to the
legion that destroyed the amazons and
dethroned a king regardless of its own
agony

  if those final words as i thought held
personal significance it was lost in a
roar of acclaim as the toast was drunk

  what campaign was that some one
demanded you mean real live ama-
zons-women fighting 

  i do said wetzler dryly and
could they fight they were the body-
guard of behanzin king of dahomey
they were armed with huge sabers and
when they chopped at a head it went off
ker-flop they got in their daily exer-
cise that way

   however toleration is the first law of
 society-toleration of legion slang of
 bawling oaths and insults given and
 taken in jest of anything you please
 toleration which men learn in a hard
 school

   the oldest man present said the least
 until some one called on him for a toast
 he was white-haired thinly erect vig-
 orous despite his years corrigan leaned
 over to me

   thats wetzler-a bavarian i think
he was in the legion before any of us
he has some of the damnedest stories
you ever heard  listen-

illustrated by
jeremy cannon
  this grim drama of the foreign
  legions little-known campaign
  in dahomey the kings pipe
  is the fourteenth story in an
  already famous series

  somebody down the table grunted
oh you mean that old dahomey cam-
paign back in   a parade through
the jungle for the legion a few casual-
ties and another slice of africa under
the tricolor

  wetzlers eyes flashed it was no
parade my friend a few casualties
only a few hundred true but ten down
with fever or dysentery for every one
touched by a bullet tremendous losses
a march of sixty days on abomey the
capital every day of that march con-
tinual fighting often hand-to-hand and
no jungle either but river marshes and
tropical brush and in those days the
legion had adventurers in its ranks
man who played chess with kings for
pawns men who juggled life and death
in either hand and who laughed when
they lost and paid  

  a ripple of applause greeted his perora-
tion he had something that old fellow
and every one of us felt the power of
him my friend corrigan spoke up

  wetzler if theres a story back of all
that lets have it we know the legion
of the war of syria of morocco were
fed up with all that dahomey-thats
a new one on me whats the story or
is there one

  more applause as wetzler looked
around decision came into his face

  yes he said almost defiantly a
story to eat your hearts out-not my
story but that of bauer he was in my
company i knew him well i know
what happened to him he had his head
cut off-and yet he served with the le-
gion for another eight months and was
discharged on our return to algeria
what kind of a joke is that de-
manded a voice are you serious  or
drunk

  i repeat said wetzler deliberately
bauer had his head cut off yet was
with the legion in the rest of the cam-
paign and may be alive yet for all i
know

 oh you mean magic african
magic eh put in corrigan

  wetzler flashed him a look

  i do not mean magic i mean pre-
cisely what i say the storys never
been told never been known though
snatches of it are in the records it can
do no harm to tell it now if you want
to hear it

  everybody yelled assent for those
words of his had us all guessing he
stated a rank impossibility and had
thrown out the only possible answer
that of magic or wizardry and while
the wine of wizardry has always held
allure for men the necromance of the
utterly impossible has always appealed
peculiarly to the legion yes he had
his audience no doubt about that

he went on to tell about bauer one
of those contradictory persons who
appear destined for a hangmans noose
bauer was led to where
the king waited with his
fearsome bodyguard or
black amazons men
were kneeling before
him - the leaders who
had been defeated

yet whose evil natures are lit by flashes
of nobility bauer had a terrifically
bad record in a day when the legion
was noted for such records it was no
secret that his name was assumed but
as he himself had morosely observed his
whole family was devil-marked

  bauer was a big strapping fellow
with a wide brow intelligent eyes pow-
erful features beards were then pop-
ular in and out of the legion bauer
wore his curly brown beard cut square
just below his chin and he was hairy to
the eyes

  he was given to strange moods of de-
pression or uplift he could be a joy-
ous singing giant or an unutterable
brute usually the latter liquor mad-

dened him and in a drunken rage he was
simply a destroying fury nobody loved
him except the woman he had married
shortly before the marfching battalion
left algeria-she was the daughter of
a quartermaster at oran and should
have known better the day they em-
barked she showed up with a black eye
and bruised lips to wave farewell

  bauer did not like the prospect of
central africa and he hated everyone
around him he spent half the voyage
in cells becoming more and more em-
bittered against lieutenant friant sur-
prisingly enough he knew a good deal
about dahomey though he refused point-
blank to say how he knew so extensive
was his knowledge that the higher com-


mand took cognizance of it and he was
frequently detailed to give information
regarding maps and routes and customs
but one day when he was in expansive
mood the colonel put the question to
him and he explained

  one of my family is there or was
he has written home volumes about the
place the letters have interested me

  the general hope in the company was
that bauer would remain permanently in
dahomey he had another year of his
enlistment to serve which meant that
he had made life hell to those around
him for six years and they were tired
of it

  the legion battalion formed part of
the dodds column formed to march

  up-country and definitely to extinguish
  king behanzin and his bloody capital
  of abomey just beyond his sacred town
  of kana behanzin had all but pushed
  the french colony into the sea was ac-
  tually on the outskirts of porto novo
  and the march would assuredly be a
  continual fight at least until the holy
  town of kana was taken

    nor was it any march against black
  savages behanzin had an army of
  close to ten thousand warriors trained
  by europeans and armed with repeating
  rifles germans were all through this
  country and according to barracks gossip
  german traders had given the king not
  only arms in plenty but even a few
  krupp guns what dodds could do with
  
his little column was problematical
after leaving requisite garrisons he had
only the legion a few marines and na-
tive troops--senegalese and haussas
some two thousand all told

three days before the march began
bauer was summoned to headquar-
ters to give information on routes as
there were no roads and the natives
could not be trusted his knowledge was
valuable he came back to barracks
after consuming a few drinks of palm-
wine on the way and came face to face
with lieutenant friant who perceived
his condition and curtly ordered him to
the guard-house

  bauer whom the heady palm-wine
had turned into a perfect fiend furiously
tore open his cartridge-pouch whipped
a rifle from the rack and fired point-
blank at the lieutenant the bullet
missed friants cheek by an inch and
slapped into the mud wall half a
dozen of the legion piled on to bauer
before he could fire again they got him
down but he was foaming at the mouth
raving mad and not until he was tied up
could he be dragged off to the cells

  when he finally sobered up he could
remember nothing that had happened
his fate was perfectly clear and he ac-
cepted it with sullen oaths court-mar-
tial and execution   

  the lieutenant that evening took his
men aside and spoke with them one by
one-all who had witnessed the scene
next morning came the court-martial
bauer was brought in surly begrimed
with the look of a trapped animal he
mumbled a few inarticulate words and
fell silent for him all was hopeless
lieutenant friant took the stand and
spoke simply clearly quietly

  the fault is really mine for having
issued loaded cartridges by mistake
they should have been blanks in fact
private bauer must have supposed them
blanks as these were issued to all the
men

  surprise here questioning of the other
men they all replied alike not of
course that the officers trying the case
were fooled by this talk of blank car-
tridges they even eyed friant and his
legionnaires with a certain cynical ad-
miration as though wishing him joy
of his bargain

  and they were right bauer got off
with a light sentence of cells and degra-
dation  but far from expressing any grat-
itude he cursed the lieutenant bitterly



with brutal and furious oaths as soon
as he could speak freely and this won
no love for him among his comrades

  the march began and almost came to
a sudden end at dogba when four thou-
sand of behanzins picked troops struck
the camp like a whirlwind at five in the
morning it was a complete surprise
the amazons strapping black women
with huge sabers led the attack the
camp was penetrated for a moment all
was lost commandant faurax gathered
the legion and fell dead raging the
legion went into the blacks with the
cold steel met the amazons hand to
hand cleared the camp of the enemy and
then attacked the four thousand the
black troops were shattered and disap-
peared in the brush

  bauer fought like ten that morning
and in the days of constant brush fight-
ing that followed bore himself well

  the advance was stubbornly con-
tested the enemy cut off the lines of
communication and the supply service
was disrupted the marsh-lands along
the river were horrible the higher brush
beyond was sun-smitten sickness be-
gan to make heavy inroads the con-
voys bringing up water were attacked
daily colonel dodds reluctantly de-
cided to return to akpa reorganize the
column evacuate the sick and wounded
firmly establish the service of supply
and then finish the job kana and the
capital abomey were not far now

  behanzin at this recoil of the column
imagined it in defeat and his black
troops harassed the line of march night
and day the senegalese suffered most
as usual they had their wives and fam-
ilies along not to fight but to prepare
their food help in carrying their loads
take care of them if ill or wounded and
so forth these people suffered so did
the coolies who formed the transport
so did the legion for that matter since
food had run out the horses disappeared
the splendid mules brought from al-
geria worth upward of a thousand
francs there did not survive long here
those not killed by the climate went into
the pots of the legion

  it was a terrific march under the sun
of the equator with akpa almost at
hand the crisis came when for lack of
porters the senegalese tried to carry the
litters of the sick and wounded they
crumpled up the column was halted
with a spatter of rifle-fire along front



  and rear where the blacks were attacking
it was bauer who with a rolling volley
of oaths broke ranks and waved an arm
at his comrades

  come along come along  he bawled
furiously let the senegalese fight for
a bit the legions good for other
things

  the others got his idea advanced on
the litters and the astonished officers
beheld the legion doing coolie work for
the sick and wounded all the rest of the
way into akpa

  oddly enough in all this marching and
fighting as the food failed and sickness
hit bauer kept up to the mark it was
observed that he always had lemons on
hand would trade anything for lemons
he had kept his knowledge to himself
which made the other men furious but
lemons not only kept one in health here
they also gave a grateful breath to the
sick and wounded the very odor was
enough to make a feverish man smile
gratefully

  so if bauer was blessed for one deed
he was cursed for another and he gave
back curse for curse like a snarling
beast no one was sorry when he dis-
appeared

  it came just before they reached ak-
pa a furious tornado hit the column
black clouds terrific wind that kicked
up a dust-storm until they struggled
blindly  finally rain in sweeping torrents
and all the time the pick-pock of
rifles along the skirmish lines where the
native troops fought off the harassing
blacks private bauer was pricked off
on the list of missing

fighting gusty rain and wind that
bent trees and almost carried a man
from his feet bauer stumbled into
a gully was knocked senseless and
revived to find himself being hauled out
by grinning black soldiers he fought
and was rewarded by a long slave-yoke
of wood fastened about his neck nearly
bending him double with its weight
whips stinging his legs to urge him on

  in this fashion he finished the march
not to akpa but to abomey-a city of
mud walls where heads grinned on spikes
of thatched huts and huddled mud
houses of the mud and timber palace of
king behanzin fronting on a great mar-
ket-square

  when they took off the yoke bauer
flew at the blacks around him hoping
to make them kill before they tortured
he fought with the insensate ferocity of
the blue book magazine

a beast caught a spear from the nearest
man killed three of them before a club
knocked him over then he was bound
and with blood besmearing his face and
beard was led through the huge square
to where the king waited among his five
hundred wives and his fearsome body-
guard of black amazons

  a heavy black man wrapped in an old
green silk dressing-gown features wood-
en cruel impassive a number of men
were kneeling before him an amazon
beside each one  these were leaders of
his regiments whom the column had de-
feated behanzin lifted his hand the
sabers of the amazons whirled and the
heads of the kneeling men dropped to
the earth the ground was blood-stained
for yards around from other executions

bauer was marched forward wiping
the blood from his eyes he saw the
white-clad figure of a european among
the group behind the king-a massive
heavily bearded man this man spoke
rapidly with the king who gave a curt
order instead of being handed over to
the amazon killers bauer found himself
led away to a hut except for a chain
that bound his ankle to the center-post
of the hut he was left free bowls of
food were brought in an amazon stood
guard at the door and he was left in
peace like the animal he was he ate
washed the blood from his face and fell
asleep

  when he wakened it was sunset and
a man sat smoking and watching him

it was the european he had seen behind
the king

  bauer sat up and blinked the man
was smoking a long native pipe whose
bowl and stem were heavily and beauti-
fully ornamented with worked silver it
caught the eye instantly

  ah  exclaimed bauer thats a
pipe a real one

  king behanzins pipe said the vis-
itor in german he gave it to me as a
mark of his favor so you dont know
me herman

  bauers mouth fell open his blue eyes
widened a low cry burst from him

 you no no-not you hans it
cannot be-youre dead-

  the other smiled leaned over to him
embraced him swiftly

  so brother herman i find you in
the french army the legion yes the
last i heard from home you had en-
listed

  bauer drew away that touch of af-
fection was more surprise than anything
else a remnant of boyhood perhaps
when affection had existed

  ach  he grunted meeting the cold
blue eyes cold as his own and you
hans how is it that youre not dead
after your last letters came there was
word of your death

  politeness hans was of the same
general build and air as his brother had
much the same voice without the beard
perhaps the two men would not have
looked so much alike the beard of
hans was a little more grizzled than the
square-cut beard of herman bauer but
it was full sweeping oyer his chest

so you dont know me
bauers mouth fell open
a cry burst from him no
not you hans it cannot
be-youre dead-


warriors in exile

  politeness to the family he went on
cynically i had an argument with my
superior regarding a serious shortage in
the funds of the trading-company it
came to blows he got the worst of it
naturally and i decamped i was with
an english company on the niger for a
year then came over on my own to
dahomey i did well officially of
course im dead here im hans
schmidt trader assistant to the king
counselor what you like ive handled
a lot of deals for him such as bringing
in guns and powder and cartridges if
i ever get out of this country ill be well
off thats in some doubt thanks to
your damned french how ill get out
without my identity being learned is a
problem and now you have to turn up
to complicate matters

  complicate matters  repeated bauer
yes the king wants your head to
put over the gate i got him to post-
pone taking it until tomorrow so i could
get information out of you in regard to
the french column but tomorrow-
and he shrugged as he resumed smoking
bauer stared and gulped hard

  eh but if youre in favor with
him you can have me held as a prisoner
ejjchanged anything

  nothing said the other with a ter-
rible finality no prisoners in this war
my honest brother behanzin wants a
white head above his gate and means to
have it with it hell win the war-so
the fetich priestesses have told him hes
already convinced that the column has
retired beaten

  bah merely to reorganize get rid
of the sick and wounded and make a
dash for kana and this accursed place

  hans nodded so i thought myself
and i must get away before your french
reach here theyd hardly treat me with
consideration luckily i speak french
perfectly also english and my moneys
safe out of the country-

  my god said bauer and thats
all you think about when im to die to-
morrow 

  be sensible the other said coolly
youve been dead to me for a long
time we neednt prate about brotherly
love id help you if i can but its out
of the question even if i got you away
from this town youd never get ten miles
without being run down i hope your
comrades in the legion have more af-
fection for you than the folks at home
or are you still a mad dog

  bauer snarled in response and hans
laughed a little

  the same eh he resumed lightly
youve never redeemed yourself and
the family name and you never will i
would if i could but youd not thats
the difference between us my brother

xah  jeered bauer and you
 couldnt even if you would  youre
officially dead at this minute

  hans chuckled amusedly right a
good joke too however i could clear
out of here go to canada or america
and become a new man-simply because
no one would ever be looking for me
id have money i could go into busi-
ness-

  why dont some of these blacks kill
you snapped bauer how can it be
safe for you here especially if behanzin
gets defeated by the whites

hans held up the beautiful silver pipe
this-you see the kings pipe is
known everywhere its a sort of safe-


the blue book magazine

guard no one would dare touch me if
i showed it

  then why couldnt you let me take
it and slip out of the damned place
hans shook his head thoughtfully
that has occurred to me quite useless
your escape would be discovered your
charming guard is changed every three
hours and in three hours youd not get
far in fact if i save you from torture
ill be doing all in my power

he was quite calm about it quite
definite beneath his impassive
mien however was an equally definite
stirring of anxiety even emotion bauer
divined this and suddenly comprehended
if any earthly thing could be done to
save him his brother would do it there
simply was nothing next moment this
was proven

  a message to akpa he suggested
if the french knew any white prisoners
had been taken they might-

hans shook his massive beard i sent
off word this morning he said quietly
my messenger was turned back
bauer drew a deep breath and nodded
i see well brother i thank you i
understand    shall i see you again
hans nodded

  in the morning yes it wont be until
noon well have until then meantime
ill try everything in my power ive
tried everything except threats-it isnt
healthy to try threats with behanzin
but ill try them are more troops
coming up to join your force do you
know 

  a detachment of marines yes
good perhaps i can make the fool
see reason you know he added grave-
ly this king is what we at home would
call a monster he thrives on blood
auf wiedersehen 

  bauer found himself alone again his
eyes followed the square-shouldered fig-
ure with the silver pipe in its hand

  noon tomorrow then and now the
evening was at hand he remembered
how the amazons had lopped off those
heads each at one swift sure stroke he
fumbled in his pocket for tobacco and
rolled a cigarette his few belongings
remained intact for he had nothing that
attracted black cupidity he smoked
thoughtfully calmly after all no man
could have a quicker cleaner death-if
only there were no torture

  when hans the following morning
came stooping into the hut and straight-
ened up the attitude of the two men was

just the opposite of what it had been
the previous day now it was the khaki-
clad bauer who was impassive phleg-
matic absolutely cool now it was the
white-clad hans who was nervous agi-
tated his eyes bloodshot his fingers un-
steady as they clasped the silver pipe
at sight of the pipe the amazon on
guard had admitted him at once

  ive just been with behanzin he
burst out there was a scene-a hell
of a scene he damned near had his
women slice me on the spot i used
threats i told him the french were
being reinforced the fat fools been
drinking hes just killed twenty native
prisoners a couple of your senegalese
in the group hes sending for you in
ten minutes ach gott its frightful
im helpless-

  forget it brother bauer said quiet-
ly and smiled theres something you
can do for me if you will change
clothes with me then put on your
white coat again so you wont be in
french uniform

 hans stared at him eh why
i should like to die in clean garments
brother its a fancy of mine

  hans obeyed with tears glittering on
his beard he donned the army boots
the torn khaki trousers and shirt his
hand struck something in the shirt
pocket

  whats this

  my papers keep them bauer lit
his last cigarette now do something
else for me

  anything my god if theres any-
thing-

  youll do it give me your word of
honor brother

  of course  said hans in a shaken
voice what then

bauer smiled calm yourself you
want to get out of this count ry well
im showing you the way cut your
beard square like mine-you see you
have the clothes the papers you have
the silver pipe which will get you safe
away from here go back and join the
legion in my name-say that the blacks
captured you but you got away-
herman youre insane

  quite the contrary half the legion
speaks french with an accent or speaks
it very poorly youve been a soldier
no one would question you for a mo-
ment ive got a bad record well turn
it into a good record hans you
couldnt manage it under different cir-
warriors in exile

cumstances perhaps but here on cam-
paign itll go off like clockwork shave
your beard entirely if you like later
on ive always worn a beard in the
legion-

 a tramp of feet a dozen of the
amazons were marching up he rose
calmly and put out his hand

  theyre here good-by brother oh
i forgot to tell you-so many things-

 they gave him no time to tell any-
thing the two men embracing were
roughly jerked apart hans fell with
his face in his hands sobbing bauer
marched out proudly and calmly and
everything was drowned in the yelling
voices of the thousands of black folk
thronged in the great square before the
palace

 next time hans saw the face of his
brother it was on a spike above the
palace gate it speaks well for him per-
haps that he risked a great deal to get
that head down and took it with him
when he went by night and buried it

some days later bauer came stagger-
ing into camp the column was ad-
vancing from akpa he was picked up
muttering in fever and his appearance
wgs regarded as miraculous his story
was disjointed incoherent but he had
suffered much and he had learned a
reat deal about the army of king be-
anzin about the fortifications at kana
about everything the superior command
most needed to know

  true he had forgotten a great deal
about things closer to hand when he
met lieutenant friant the young officer
halted and held out his hand

 im glad you got back bauer he
said frankly curiously congratula-
tions  

  thank you lieutenant said bauer
awkwardly but with a friendly glow in
his blue eyes thank you it is like
coming back from the dead

  the officer looked after him curiously
assuredly the fellow had changed

  others found it so too in little ways
on the march he just didnt know his
way around he was awkward fumbling
uncertain he seemed to have forgot-
ten many things all this was natural
with the touch of fever that was on him
the remarkable point was the difference
in the man himself all the old snarling
animal had disappeared bauer was a
man now human doubtfully hesitant-
ly some of his comrades began to like
him a little   

  they plunged directly into brush fight-
ing the column hammered straight on
for kana the holy city of dahomey
this was defended with desperate cour-
age the battle lasted three whole days
but the french were fully informed of
the intrenchments the disposition of
behanzins army and the terrain ahead
the hand-to-hand fighting was severe
the amazons died with ferocity but
they died

  bauer got his ticket home-a bullet
tearing through his chest that landed
him in a litter as the wounded waited
for the convoy to start back with them
lieutenant friant came staggering along
escorted by two men an access of fever
shook him he was pale and flushed by
turns and halted unable to go another
step while his men went to search for a
litter

  ha my lieutenant said bauer
heres something thatll do you good
painfully he twisted about got a hand
to the musette under his head and drew
out a lemon the officer seized it with
a gasp of gratitude then checked him-
self

  no no you need it more than i do
bauer

  bah private bauer laughed a little
his white teeth flashing through that
square bushy beard of his i detest
lemons my lieutenant

  and friant bit into the yellow fruit
with a sigh as he sank down on the
litter provided for him he died three
days later   

 bauer oh he was tough he got
sent back to the base and on to porto
novo and his wound healed in time
he had not even lost his pipe-a long
pipe of beautifully worked silver about
the wooden bowl and stem one of the
officers recognizing it as native work
offered him a large sum for it but
bauer only laughed

  pardon but i can never part with
this pipe it is more than money to me
where would i get another like it
where indeed  sighed the officer
regretfully however bauer when
you get back to algeria and your wife
has a womans say about that pipe-my
offer stands good

  this was bauers first intimation that
a wife awaited him in algeria

and there to the general surprise of
k everyone wetzler ended his story
abruptly voices poured at him to con-
tinue demanding to know one thing and
warriors in exile

another he held up his hand with a
shrug

 comrades you say the dahomey
campaign was a parade eh well let
me tell you something we came back
to oran and before we had reached the
zouave barracks where the dames de
france had arranged a feast for us we
began to go to hospital its the truth
not one of us was the same man for
weeks afterward the men of the legion
were taken off to hospital-

  corrigan lifted a lusty voice

  devil take your hospitals what
we want to know is what became of
bauer and the wife of his brother

  wetzler shook his head i dont
know at the end of his enlistment he
left the service i imagine he married
the wife who was waiting for him-
surely a woman would know the truth
well thats all

  it was disappointing we had ex-
pected some grand climax and there was
none to the story   

  when the party broke up corrigan
drove home with ime

  if youre so damned interested in
what happened to bauer he said to
me why dont you ask wetzler your-
self theres no doubt the old rascal
knows but he simply wont tell he
has a tailor-shop out on the west side of
town somewhere-look it up in the tele-
phone-book herman h wetzler is the
name

  well i looked it up found the ad-
dress and drove out there i was curi-
ous enough to put the question to him

  i had to park at some little distance
from his tailor shop which was a small
but comfortable-looking establishment
so i left the car and walked along to the
shop and paused to look in the window

  what a lucky pause that was in-
side showing samples to a client i saw
wetzlers spare trim figure a gray-
haired woman came from the back room
with some question he turned to her
smiled kissed her cheek affectionately
and came back to his client and as he
did so i saw that he held a pipe in his
hand-a long-stemmed pipe of queer
design stem and bowl covered over with
silverwork of curious form

  as i looked at it the truth flashed
upon me this was the pipe of king
behanzin of course

  so i went away without asking any
question i knew the answer already

  another vivid story in this remarkable

  series will be a feature of our next issue

sea

a famous sailor and writing-
man tells the story of a strange
wager and a hot-fought race
around cape horn

                                       

 i was twenty-three on the day that
 i passed the exam for my second
 mates license the exam was over
 by noon and i went straight to
 the docks to look for a ship second
 mates berths were scarce with a score
 of applicants for every vacancy

   id been aboard a half-dozen ships
 when i came to the south star crossing
 her gangway i met a fellow with one of
 his arms in a sling after her second
 mates berth he asked and at my
 reply said im glad i busted my fin
 youll be wishing youd broken your
 neck before youre done with the ship

whats wrong with her i inquired

   the ships right enough its the
 confounded skipper he replied

  whats the matter with him i
 asked

   all he thinks of is how fast he can
 drive her he answered

suits me i like a driving skipper

   me too but theres a limit he
 grumbled this voyage hell sail her
 clear under and she wont come up
 take my tip and back out before you
 get in and then with a glance at the
 south stars poop he added theres
 the crazy fool now youd think he
 was old enough to have some sense
by bill adams

illustrated by frederic anderson

  ahes not more than three or four
years older than me i replied and
started on to go aboard

  laying a restraining hand on my arm
he asked havent you heard about
the polaris

  what about her i asked

  the two ships go out on the tide to-
morrow morning the polaris skipper
is another driving fool hes sixty if
hes a day no fool like an old fool
theyve got a bet on the race i dont
know what it is but im glad im out
of it take my tip and go hunt a berth
elsewhere

  no skipper can drive too hard to suit
me i retorted and passed on

  a burst of cheering came from a little
way up the dock it was from the
polaris going out to drop anchor in the
river and wait for next mornings tide

  i should note that this was not the
modern polaris-a fine ship which some
of you may have seen-but another able
ship of the same name now gone to her
reward

  youre after the second mates berth
eh asked the skipper of the south
star looking me up and down when i
stepped to his poop youd better think
twice its going to be no soft voyage

     ive done my thinking sir

    good thats the spirit he ex-
  claimed and led me to his chart-room
  and signed me on

    may i ask what the bet is sir i
  asked i hear youve a bet with the
  polaris skipper

    if i win the worlds mine he re-
  plied if i lose-well im not going
  to lose

     since it was plain that he didnt want
  to tell me what the bet was i went
  about my business the mate and third
  mate were hustling the crew getting all
  ready for sea in a couple of hours we
  went out and dropped anchor in the
  river usually a crew gets a good rest
  the last night in port but that night
  the crews of both ships were kept on
  deck going carefully over all the gear

  at dawn the ships went to sea each
   with a tug-boat ahead about a mile
  offshore they cast off their tugs and
  started to set sail there was a fresh
  wind and choppy sea the sky spoke
  of more wind to come

both ships had their topsails set when
the polaris hoisted a signal calling her
tug back seeing her stop our skipper
stopped the south star that we might

pull ior all youre worth 
cried to my boats crew and the
boat sped into the darkness

gain no unfair advantage through our
rival having a bad start they had
found a stowaway and were sending him
ashore in the tug but before her tug
could get alongside the polaris squared
her sails and stood on her skipper had
changed his mind and was taking the
stowaway to sea one of our crew said
stowaways is lucky sometimes some-
times a stowawayll bring a ship luck

  a squall whipped over the sea a tor-
rent of rain beat down the land faded
astern lying over side by side a little
way apart the ships were soon running
like stags so it was till dusk then
we lost the polaris lights in the murk
ignoring the rule of the road that orders
all ships to go cautiously in thick weather
our skipper kept every inch of sail set
the ship tearing through the smother
with her decks awash every rope near
the breaking strain

  morning came with the wind harder
than ever the rain heavier the sea in-
visible half a mile away  so it was
for three days and nights the ship stag-
gering under her press of sail with her
decks flooded from end to end on the
fourth morning the wind came yet hard-
er but the clouds broke and a few
patches of sky showed far away her
hull hidden only her upper sails visible
was the polaris still running neck and
neck with us

  since wed left port id slept only in
snatches so had the mate and third
mate the skipper hadnt once left the
deck if hed slept hed done it on his
feet the steward had taken his meals

to the poop now and then wed let
part of the crew go below for a few
hours but day and night had kept some
of the best men at the halyards ready to
lower sail in a rush if the skipper gave
orders to do so

  theres more wind coming the mate
said to me his eyes on the scurrying
clouds

  let it come sir said i

  i miss my guess if one of the ships
doesnt get dismasted continued the
mate and with a shrug added well
thatll settle the race if either gets dis-
masted or wrecked the other will win
automatically thats agreed

  fair enough sir said i let the
better ship win  

  nightfall proved the mate right about
the wind as it suddenly freshened he
called the men from the halyards and
ordered them to stand by the sheets
with the wind wild as it now was no
sail would lower if the halyards were let
go-the force of the wind would hold the
spar up keep your knives handy if
the order comes to take in sail cut the
sheets in a hurry ordered the mate

  all night men stood by the sheets
now and then one or other of the mates
lay down on the deck for a cat-nap but
all night the skipper stood by the helms-
man what did he mean i wondered
by if i win the worlds mine

  at dawn the wind eased and came
from astern the ship rode erect with
dry decks a warm sun on her and still
we saw the polaris her upper sails just
visible running neck and neck with


us    for ten days we sailed in a
steady trade wind and morning by
morning saw her where she had been
when night fell we mates went to our
cabins to sleep now when off duty but
the skipper took only cat-naps in the
chart-room and had his meals taken
there one evening i ventured to ask
him what happens if the race ends in
a draw sir

  a draws no good ive got to win
he tersely replied

wed been five weeks at sea before
we lost sight of our rival a morn-
ing came when she was no longer seen
that day the skipper was like a caged
panther pacing the poop hour after hour
forever searching the horizon with his
telescope toward evening we met a
ship sailing in the opposite direction just
within signaling distance replying to
our question she told us that she could
see the sails of our rival above the ho-
rizon on her other side

  four days later we met another ship
that told us the same soon after that
ship was gone a hard wind rose and for
three days and nights the ship ran again
like a hunted stag her decks awash with
waist-deep water on the fourth day a
samer passed us and signaled that shed
seen our rival fifty miles astern then
at last the skipper ordered some sail off
the staggering ship it was just in time
for while we were taking in the light
sails a savage squall came from dead
ahead to save the masts from going
overboard we were forced to take in all
sail but the upper topsails we were
entering the roaring forties and they
were true to their name

  that night unable to go her course
the ship labored in terrific seas all
night all next day a wind of almost hur-
ricane force drove her farther and
farther to leeward i was on duty when
in the middle of the next night the wind
eased and the weather cleared ahead
and a little to one side of the ship was
a bright light that i knew at once was no
ships light as i called the skipper from
the chart-room the clouds parted faint
in the dim moonlight w made out the
loomof an island i didnt know there
was a lighthouse hereabouts sir said i

  there isnt  he replied and added 
some vessels been wrecked her people
have seen our lights and are signaling
for help theyll have to wait till some
other ship comes along i cant stop it
may go hard on them but they wont

starve there are plenty of birds and
eggs and shellfish and theres water
for a few minutes we stood on watch-
ing the bonfire high on the island then
suddenly the skipper cried call all
hands on deck steer for the island
ive a notion that its the polaris thats
wrecked we must find out if its
the polaris the race is won 

  but suppose that its not sir she
was only fifty miles astern before the
gale started shell be catching us up
while we delay i suggested

  it wont take long to find out he
replied in an hour or so we can get
the castaways aboard and be on our
way again

  coming on deck the mate said to me
no night to put a boat out this is
only a lull before long the windll come
hard as ever

  with the south star stopped maybe
an eighth of a mile offshore the skipper
turned to me and asked are you will-
ing to take a boat ashore and as he
spoke a moan came over the dark sea a
spatter of rain fell

  yes sir i replied

  take four of the best men and look
alive ordered the skipper

  pull for all youre worth  i cried to
my boats crew and as they lay back on
their oars and the boat sped into the
darkness the moan of the wind grew
louder the rain thicker

the squall passed the rain ceased
i looked for the bonfire in vain the
rain drowned their fire out sir called
one of my men and as he spoke the
young moon shone through a cloud rift

  backwater all i ordered for the
boat was close to the island now and on
the beach a great surf was breaking i
studied the surf to beach the boat was
not going to be possible that thunder-
ing surf would crush her like an eggshell
there was nothing to do but go back to
the ship i turned the boat about or-
dered my men to lay back-and had but
done so when again i cried backwater
all  and brought the boat to a stop

  whats up sir called one of my
men as i rose to my feet and began to
throw off my clothes

  im going to swim ashore i replied
pull back to the ship and tell him ill
signal by burning two flares if its not
the polaris thats wrecked then hell
sail on ill not be able to swim back
ill wait with the castaways to be taken
off by some other ship
   yell be broke to bits in the surf
 sir cried one of my men but his
 words gave me no concern i was a
 powerful swimmer

   stripped of all save my shirt and dun-
 garee trousers i took from the boats
 locker two flares wrapped them tight
 in oilskin and secured them to my belt

   all right lads pull back aboard
 i ordered and slipped over the boats
 stern to the dark water

   a squall whined rain lashed down
 the squall passed the rain ceased
 looking for the bonfire i could see noth-
 ing i struck out harder louder and
 louder grew the roar of the surf for a
 moment it came to me that perhaps there
 had been something in the warning voiced
 by one of the boats crew but there
 could be no going back now a great
 roller lifted and swept me shoreward
 it passed and i was deep in a hollow
 another lifted me hurled me shoreward
 and broke with a roar for a space i
 knew nothing then regaining my senses
 and feeling the shore beneath me i tried
 to get to my feet-only to be knocked
 down and rolled over and over when
 that roller receded i crawled on all fours
 from the water bruised breathless half
 drowned

to seaward all was darkness the
south stars lights were lost in an
oncoming squall looking again for the

 bonfire i saw only equal darkness i
 shouted no answer save the rage of the
 sea again and again i shouted save
 your breath you fool  i muttered and
 started toward where i judged the bonfire
 to have been-only to stumble fall
 sprawling and bruise myself anew pres-
 ently creeping half erect i felt a huge
 boulder that cut from me the worst fury
 of the wind and rain and crouched down
 remembering my flares i felt for them
 they were gone    hour after hour
 while the furious night dragged on i
 crouched shivering under the boulder
 feeling as though no whole bone were left

  when at last dawn came i staggered
from the rocky foreshore to the grass-
grown slope of the island here and
there were bushes and wind-twisted
trees i shouted no answer save
your breath i muttered and pausing to
scan the steep slope saw high above
me a rock wall at the foot of which was
a cave good thats where theyll
be i thought and trembling with cold
and exhaustion slowly made my way on
bleeding feet up the slope

  it seemed an eternity ere i at last
came to the cave and saw just outside
it a heap of blackened embers my
pulses quickened at sight of them i
shouted and had no answer theyll tje
asleep i thought and entered the cave
a little within it i stopped

  and then as my eyes became accus-
tomed to the gloom i saw outstretched
and motionless at the end of the cave a
figure indistinct in a long oilskin coat
its face hidden by a souwester its hands
hidden by mittens such as sailors wear
when steering kneeling i laid a hand
upon the castaways shoulder

  the sleeper stirred then removing
the souwester sat up soft brown curls
fell in a cloud about the oilskin-clad
shoulders bright brown questioning
eyes looked into my face you could
have bowled me over with a feather
it was a girl of maybe eighteen

  who are you what ship are you
from i cried

  the polariscame the calm reply

  when was she wrecked where are
the rest of her people i cried

  shes not wrecked that i know of
the mate went back aboard she
answered her tones as casual as though
nothing were odd about the situation

  thinking that it must be a dream i
stared incredulously at her who are
you what ship are you from she
asked
  im the south stars second mate
i replied-and come to the end of my
tether my every limb aching slumped
down

  she laid her oilskin coat over me
took my hands in hers and chafed them
try to sleep ill see if i can make a
fire and warm you she said i lapsed
into unconsciousness   

  when i came to my senses day was
almost gone the girl was bending
above me close to me was a little fire
you must eat ive got some shellfish
and some sea-birds eggs she said i
sat up weakly she put an arm about
my shoulder held me against her and
with her other hand set food to my lips
my strength came back a little as i ate

  youre cool as though you were a
sailor said i what were you doing
aboard the polaris how did you come
to be here

  im her skippers daughter  ive often
sailed with him but this voyage i stowed
away she answered

  stowed away i exclaimed

  i wanted to see the race the mate
found me just after we sailed father
was going to send me ashore she re-
plied and added with a laugh he
changed his mind because the crew all
said id bring the ship good luck

  but how do you come to be here i
asked

  your turn now how did you get
washed overboard she replied and sat
down opposite me with the firelight
shining in her bright eyes gazing at
her i thought ill wake up soon in my
cabin aboard the south star

  go on your turn now she repeated
so i told her how i came to be there
and at the end i said theyve given
me up for drowned of course theyve
sailed on and then feeling horribly
weak i lay down again

  youd better sleep some more urged
the girl

  youve not told me how you come to
be here i said

  warmed by the fire i lay dozing while
she talked now hearing a few words
more or less clearly now aware of only

the indistinguishable murmur of her
voice there was something about be-
ing locked in a cabin and being allowed
out only at evening there was some-
thing about a bag of salt and a boat
loaded with barrels and then i heard
plainly with a little laugh in the words
i found the cave and hid and the mate
went back to the ship and then bend-
ing above me she said im wasting my
breath youre too sleepy to listen ill
tell you all about it later

sometime in the night i wakened
the girl lay asleep i rose on an el-
bow and gazed at her face the firelight
shining on it the roar of wind and sea
were gone now the thunder of the surf
was fallen away i rose and went un-
steadily to the mouth of the cave the
storm was over

  it isnt a dream i said to myself
and went back and sat down by the girl
there was a sort of dizziness on me my
head clear at times and then befuddled
from my having been so rolled about by
the surf on the rocky beach the girl
stirred and her lips moved

  dearest she murmured

  my bruises my cut feet were forgot-
ten i bent low touched my lips to her
soft cheek she gave me back my kiss
and then her eyes opened wide and she
sat up and as though she were now
for the first time aware of me an amazed
look came to her face in a moment
that look of amazement gave way to a
meditative expression

  do you really think the south star
has sailed on she asked

nearest she murmured
-and save me back my
kiss then her eyes opened
wide and she sat up
the blue book magazine

  theres no sure telling i answered
they may have stayed to look for me
at the end of the storm and it seemed
to me that a sort of alarmed expression
came to her eyes

  my fathers certain to have stayed to
look for me she said

  one things sure we must both go
aboard the first ship that shows up
said i

  yes-both of us she agreed her
voice very eager

  i moved to take her in my arms and
then that vile dizziness came on again
hold me ill be all right i got a bit
knocked about in the surf i said and
with my head in her lap i drowsed off

when i came to my senses i was
in a bunk beside which stood a
young man who stared at me with an
amused look well how in blazes are
you he asked and before i could speak
added so youre second mate of the
south star eh well im second mate
here hows tricks giving me no
chance to answer he went on you
made quite a hit with the skippers
daughter eh shes been asking to come
nurse you but not on your life not
this trip my lad the skipperd let you
peg out before hed let her out of her
cabin

  when were we picked up how did
she come to be on the island  why is
she locked in her cabin i asked

  one thing at a time sailor he
laughed we picked you up yesterday
morning and you seemed about half
dead just as we had you aboard along
came the south star to look for you so
we signaled your skipper that you
werent worth bothering about seeing
you were unfit for duty-and the race
was on again

  whys the skippers daughter locked
in her cabin  how did she come on the
island i asked

  shes locked up because shes a little
devil and was on the island for the same
reason dropping salt in our fresh-water
tank confound her he replied

  dropping salt in the fresh-water
tank what do you mean i asked

  just what i say he retorted
theres a bag of salt missing from the
ships stores

  but why should she drop it in the
fresh water  i asked

  because shes got a grouch at her
dad and wants him to lose the race and
his bet she knew wed have to stop for

fresh water and when the mate was sent
ashore with a boatload of empty barrels
she begged to be allowed to go with him
the skipper was a fool to let her for of
course the little devil wandered off just
so that the mated have to go look for
her when he was ready to go back to the
ship and then that blow had to come
along so that he had to hurry aboard
without her or else lose the boat in the
surf and now she wants to come and
nurse you ill bet theres some in-
fernal trick up her cuff the prettier
they are the worse liars they are and
id like to have her over my knee con-
found her

  why should she want the skipper to
lose his bet what is the bet i ques-
tioned

  i dont know you dont know no-
body knows he replied all i know is
that every man aboard this ship gets a
nice little bonus when we whip the
south star

  a gray-haired man entered well
how do you feel  asked the skipper of
the polaris

  pretty good sir thank you said i

  think you could put your weight on
the ropes he asked

  maybe i could but im second mate
of the south star sir i replied

  thats all right said he ive sig-
naled your skipper and hes released
you to me his third mate can act sec-
ond mate in your place one of my best
mens laid up and im handicapped i
need you badly its only fair play

for a moment i hesitated unwilling
to go back on my own ship and yet
with one of her best sailors laid up the
polaris was at a disadvantage and then
i thought of the girl well if she had
a quarrel with her dad it was none of
my affair all right sir said i if
my skippers willing it goes with me
i climbed from my bunk feeling pretty
stiff and groggy still the skipper hur-
ried off having put on some oilskins
the polaris second mate dug out for me
i went out to the deck the crew were
all forward tightening the braces

  a soft voice called to me with her
face framed in an open port the girl was
looking out on the deck she beckoned
me and hidden from her dad by the
break of the poop above i stepped to the
port quick   she whispered laugh-
ing into my eyes and pursed her lips i
kissed her and hurried off to take my
place at the ropes
sea vixen

  all day the ships ran neck and neck
sprays driving over them neither able to
gain on the other at dusk we saw the
south stars lights i went unseen to
the girls window then and found her
looking out on the deck im ashamed
of you for going back on your ship she
whispered if you love me youd want
the south star to win

  why do you want her to i asked

  dads a cranky old fool she replied
he never lets me do what i want if
you really loved me youd not help him
to win

  im between the devil and the deep
sea said i a sailor has to do his job

  oh yes and have a girl in every
port she retorted and added and
you think me a devil do you you
didnt when we were on that island
and then i thought of her on the island
just the two of us together in the cave

ome on and kiss me i dont care
which ship wins said i

  sure of that she teased

  sure i assented

  then slip forward now that its dark
and cut away the fore topsail halyards
then ill kiss you she said

  i cant do that i replied

  youre like all sailors you think
you can play with a girl well you
cant play with me she retorted and
shut the port in my face i rapped
again and again on the port and had no
answer

  day came watching for her when-
ever i passed near her port i saw the
girl but once all day and that time
she looked at me with tears in her eyes
and scornfully closed the port   

  for three days the ships drove neck
and neck with every rope at almost the
breaking strain the third night came
in dark but starry with a wild squally
wind far ahead of us the harbor lights
shone through the murk and still the
two ships were driving neck and neck
every man standing handy by the ropes
while squall after squall whined over
the dark sea

  a draws no good i remembered the
skipper of the south star saying and
wondered what the bet could be and
then watching the just discernible south
star i suddenly saw her little main sky-
sail blow to ribbons all hands aboard
the polaris saw it too and a high cheer
rose and then in my minds eye i saw
the girls face as she lay in the cave and
heard her murmur dearest and felt

her kiss on my lips again you think
you can play with a girl i heard her
say and slip forward and cut the fore
topsail halyards then ill kiss you

  what did it matter to me which ship
won all the ships on the sea could
go to blazes for all i cared

  alls fair in love i said to myself
and as a black cloud drove over the
stars i drew my knife from its sheath
and ran forward digging the blade-
point deep in the topsail halyards i
twisted it quickly making a rough cut
that no one would suspect then sped
swiftly away

  shouts and curses rose from the po-
laris deck as her fore topsail slid down
but when the halyards were repaired and
the sail hoisted again dawn was break-
ing a mile or so ahead the south star
was entering the harbor with flags flying
gayly at her mastheads as the polaris
silently followed i made my way to the
girls port it was shut i rapped on it
her face appeared laying a hand on
my knife i gestured to her letting her
know that i had done as she had asked
she laughed behind the closed port and
threw me a kiss but when i signed to
her to open the port she closed the cur-
tain instead though peeping from be-
hind it she laughed again and threw me
another kiss and then with some of
the polaris crew approaching i had to
move off a boat was coming from the
south star my own skipper in its stern

as the south stars skipper stepped
 to the poop of the polaris the girl
came from the chart-room he took her
hand in his put an arm about her drew
her to him and kissed her she gave him
kiss for kiss

  together they turned to the polaris
skipper

  the worlds mine captain  said the 
skipper of the south star

  take her and good luck i never
wanted my daughter to marry a sailor
but you won her fairly replied the
skipper of the polaris and added no
credit to her the little sea vixen 

  laughing the girl looked from one to
the other then noticed me where i stood
close by and lordy how i hated her
and when she spoke what a poor fool
i felt for then i remembered that medi-
tative look that had come to her eyes in
the cave

   alls fair in love eh sailor  she said
laughing in my face some one has to
lose

the story thus far

upon the rocky coast of nato-
wa-a strange forest region
north of siberia warmed by
volcanic fires and inhabited by
progenitors of the american indian-we
had been wrecked john la salle cap-
tain scott and his sailors and i we had
come upon a desperate venture the res-
cue of other castaways-the scientist
james munro founder of the museum of
which i was curator beth and dan la
salle daughter and son of the wealthy
man who had financed munros expedi-
tion  and lincoln rand better known as
kiogathe snow hawk grown to powerful
manhood among the indians of natowa
after his missionary parents had died

  a marauding crew of gold-hunters we
knew had made a safe landing ahead of
us we must be on guard against them
and the hostile shoni indians

  i set out alone in search of our friends
and found one of them kioga the snow
hawk and he led us to the others

  a happy reunion of our party followed
with beth la salle and munro and his
quaint factotum flashpan but dan la
salle had been captured by the shoni
and we rescued him from them only after
he had been tortured for this expedi-
tion our party had been divided and
with kioga munro flashpan and the
indian boy tokala i was trapped in
a series of vast caverns in the gigantic
mountain range beyond which lived it
was said the blue-eyed people of the
tusk wandering by torchlight far into
this rocky maze we came upon a royal
burial-chamber here munro hung about
tokalas neck a golden plaque we found
later we came out into the open air and
saw men working with great prehistoric
mastodons in harness and were our-
selves set upon and captured by the
people of the tusk

  in this adventure we had become
separated from kioga otherwise we
were lucky enough however for when
our captors caught sight of the ancient

golden plaque about tokalas neck they
treated us with the utmost consideration
for their king had recently died and
left no successor and the nobles were
about to choose a ruler an ancient
prophecy had foretold the coming of a
great prince to rule over them who
should be recognized by the golden cere-
monial plaque worn about his neck and
lo-here was this young newcomer to-
kala wearing this revered badge of roy-
alty so the nobleman mahri leader of
our captors saw a chance to make a king
of this youth now in his power and thus
make himself the real ruler of the land

  kiogas fortunes however were far
different he was imprisoned with the
slaves and made a deadly enemy of tjje
noble semya when in self-defense he
turned a whip upon his tormentor after
some days however kioga succeeded in
escaping and it chanced that he was
able to rescue the princess loalli when
the mammoth she was riding stumbled
but in so doing he earned the jealous
hatred of mahri who was in love with
loalli but kioga had made friends
with the professional thief ameeg and
his pickpocket clan-and ameeg em-
ployed his arts to disguise kioga so suc-
cessfully that even we who knew him so
well failed to recognize him when he
presented himself before prince mahri
in our presence seeking employment

  in mahris service the snow hawk in
his guise of akra a free-lance warrior
performed various tasks so ably that
presently mahri entrusted him with a
scouting mission among the tribes in the
northern mountains-where it was ru-
mored revolt was brewing the story
continues in detail

mounted upon a great riding mam-
moth provided by this employer
kioga set out one foggy night and crossed
the river landing in a thicket of giant
reeds the snow hawk was about to
push forward along the trail when his

the great tradition of
jules verne and rider
haggard is ably car-
ried on in this vividly
imagined novel

 keen ear caught the murmur of voices
 ahead dismounting he crept forward
 -then halted and held his breath to
 catch the words which carried clearly
 down the misty wind

   he was to come this way said one
 voice guardedly

  what does he look like suppose
 we should mistake another for him
 there is a scar upon his cheek which
 runs from jaw to temple one eye is
 partly closed he answers to the name
 of akra

   will he suspect

   we will not give him time

   t do not like this sticking in
 back

  nor i but who dares thwart
 noble semya

   waiting to hear no more kioga crept
 back to his mount in some way semya
 knew of his mission the false front of
 akra the mercenary warrior could
 therefore only serve to betray him to the
 enemy waiting to waylay him and so
 working hastily with the solvent ameeg

with a mighty swing the mam-
moth catapulted meru into space

had supplied him he removed all traces
of his disguise then remounting the
great beast he pushed boldly on again

   a moment later on three sides he saw
 the loom of other mounts converging on
 his path one blocking it two others
 ranging up to crowd his beast on either
 side while on the ground three robe-
 wrapped figures waited lanterns burn-
 ing oil were now uncovered throwing
 orange light upon the group a chal-
 lenge greeted him

  who are you warrior

  my name is vardo said kioga

ill
  so a muffled voice said suspicious-
ly adding dismount for questioning
kioga did as bidden and as he light-
ly touched the ground flung back his
overrobe in such a manner that it cov-
ered his own naked kuri the three
dismounted men approached him swift-
ly be sure of him warned one of
those who watched from mammoth-back 
and in response the nearest of the three
rushed in and with his blade thrust for
the snow hawks middle

  kioga took the thrust upon his read
kuri parrying the others weapon up
the contact brought them face to face
and by the flickering lights the eyes of
his attacker showed astonishment a
moment wait he warned the other
two about to lend him aid i see no
scar no drooping lid we have mistaken
you my friend it was another we
awaited

  well for you that you found that out
in time kioga said heatedly i am on
semyas business were i to tell him
that you sought my life it would go ill
with all of you my friends

  the men fell back chagrined on
semyas business even as ourselves we
were in wait for one whose face is scarred
to-

  quiet hollow-skull one of the others
checked the speaker sharply

  hollow-skulls the pack of you
kioga interrupted with fine scorn too
full from swigging lohe for attending to
a nobles orders the one you seek has
passed the while you dallied in the pub-
lic places oh i would not be you-
when semya finds that you have let him
slip between your palms

  there was a silence growing from the
consternation which these words had im-
planted the fog-we came at the ap-
pointed hour- this from their leader
stammering fn his deep confusion

 the fog has penetrated to your
wits kioga answered swiftly you
talk when action is required upon your
bulls and after him he cannot yet be
out of reach

the words set spur to their own
thoughts unhindered now kioga re-
mounted and in their company gave
swift pursuit to the figment of his own
creation hard as they rode-and a
mammoths long slow pace devours dis-
tance-they did not travel far as crows
would fly within an hour after leaving
the river-bank behind them they were
already in the high foothills surrounded

by deep forest and compelled to follow
climbing roads and twisting trails whose
hairpin turns might bring them hours
later in view of the same road on which
they had earlier passed

  the road kioga noted with appreci-
ative eyes was yet another testimony to
the skill of mandas engineers and the
ceaseless labor of the slaves and toil-
ing mammoths being sound and level to
the outer shoulders where slides of
rock and earth had torn these they had
been rebuilt and shrewdly braced with
strong sustaining timbers from the for-
ests on the slopes and on more hazard-
ous turns and steep approaches rock
walls had been erected

hour on hour the pace continued
hard though they be pressed mam-
moths show a seeming disregard of weari-
ness up to a certain point-beyond wliich
neither goading nor entreaties will move
them forward until they have recovered
energy by rest and feeding with this
in view each beast before the ordinary
journey through the peaks is loaded up
more heavily with fodder than with any
other single item

  it is thfe special duty of the cultivator-
slaves to grow and harvest several vari-
eties of moss grass sedges and wild
thyme which form the mammoths chief
food these slaves who have no other
duties whatsoever then dry and mix the
several plant-stuffs and add thereto a
concentrated vegetable substance used
throughout the realm by man and beast
alike as a stimulant-as races elsewhere
in the world use tea mati or coffee the
nourishing plant mixture then is pressed
by weights into the form of solid mat-
tresses ingeniously bound with cords in
such a way that a simple rip releases
just the proper ration for a working
beast leaving the remainder intact

  a portion of the annual harvest is by
wetting and compression molded into
solid blocks for storage in marked places
on the roads so that at any time the
traveler on his great ship of the moun-
tains may help himself to fuel-food for
his mammoth by simply taking out of
storage this bricked fodder and beating
it loose and ready for consumption

  the dried-out stuff is so disposed up-
on the mammoths back that it may first
serve as a hard cushion for the rider
which cushion being drawn upon at
every feeding time ultimately is con-
sumed until naught but a heavy pad
remains between the rider and his mount
placer knew what was expected of
him but was loath to leave his master

  unfortunately the mammoths of ki-
ogas party had not been so equipped for
a long trip along the way between two
roadway stations of supply one of the
bulls threw up its trunk and checked re-
fusing to take another forward step all
other methods failing its driver had re-
course to deep and subtle means by
which these mahouts of the manda king-
doms swear in loving tones he now be-
spoke the beast

  o thou sweet-smelling herb thy
tail is as a lovely maidens braid thy
tusks are like the sickles of the bright
new moon thy trunk drips melted
honey thine eyes are soft as dusk in
smnmertime thy feet tread as petals
fall condescend o powerful to move
one after one until we reach that yon-
der height where thou shalt banquet full
on scented plants  what no response 
then shall i tickle thee with my sharp
goad o byblow of a misbegotten bull
one little forward step what shall
entreaty fail epitome of laziness
here is to quicken thee o giant stench 
but neither cajolery nor blows can
sway a mammoth with its mind made
up and since they were in haste re-
gretfully they left the beast behind
roped to a rock its driver mounted up
behind kioga and on they went until
another bull refused to move this time
a station of supply was near and paus-
ing to refresh their animals kioga and
the warriors threw themselves to rest be-
side a quickly kindled fire near the road

  they had not been long seated when
from the upper heights a train of laden
bulls descended accompanied by slaves
and warriors afoot a score of animals
each laden to capacity moved down the
road toward the city of the kings
greetings passed between their drivers
and kiogas companions of the road and
presently a pair dropped out to gossip
for an hour with men so lately from the
capital city

  semya by their account had formed
alliance with several other lesser nobles
dominant among the mountain cities
gaining their support in mammoths men
and arms none of the soldiery knew in
what cause they had been enlisted save
that it paid them double wages for the
period of a full moon beasts warriors
and weapons were to gain admittance to
the city of the kings ostensibly to hon-
or the new king but secret orders bade
them be in readiness for anything armed
fully at all times among the warriors
there was speculation on the reason for
such mystery but to kioga it was all
too clear

  shrewd semya planned a coup of one
kind or another at the capital but
whether before or after the elevation of
the king remained uncertain enough to
know that it was planned it now re-
mained to learn the full extent of all
the preparations what more was to be
ascertained could best be gleaned in
semyas own home city this famous
stronghold lay at a distance of some
forty miles or twice that far reckoning
in the turnings of the road

  the warriors soon departed to catch
up with their train swearing that no
mammoth had passed them on the road
but where an hour since kioga would
have wished to turn about it pleased
him now to argue that they had been
deceived he was suspicious of am-
bush and so evaded you likewise he
would have hidden as they passed and
then gone on if we would take him we
must follow

meru leader of the ambush which
had thus far failed sat deep in
thought and finally voiced it his eyes up-
on kioga with an odd intentness i can-
not think how he could have evaded us
the blue book magazine

he was described as tall much like your-
self and wearing such a robe his beast
was to be patched with gray upon the
neck as is your own-no common mark
indeed save for our glimpse of your face
you must have fallen to our kuris so like
are you to him we waited for

  kioga laughed to hide a faint uneasi-
ness death skimmed me close he
answered i vow it never has passed
closer

  i cannot understand persisted the
other stubbornly

  better to be off in search of him than
sitting idle here the snow hawk an-
swered time may resolve your doubts
meanwhile remember that semya is a
hard master not easy with those servi-
tors who fail him

  that is the truth at least said me-
ru still thoughtful he rose whereat
all did likewise mounted and were on
their way again the route was now at
greater altitude and climbing steadily
the road from being broad grew steep
and ever narrower as they slowly neared
their objective semyas stronghold city
between the place of earlier pausing and
their destination a deep and seemingly
bottomless gorge cut through the moun-
tains across this narrow chasm hung
a bridge of heavy planking laid on solid
beams which were anchored to the rock
on either side with chain across this
bridge the mammoths thundered and on
its other side came to a division in the
road

  meru until this moment still wrapped
in his thoughts there checked his ani-
mal and called a parley we cannot
know which road this akra took he
said we must divide going separate
ways he turned then to kioga we
two are equal to their several let us
go on together to the left while they
search out the right-hand road

  since this arrangement did not affect
their ultimate arrival at semyas strong-
hold city kioga found nothing objec-
tionable in merus proposal and suffered
him to mount behind him merus men
on their two beasts took one trail while
meru and kioga took the other more
precipitous and perilous by far

awhile they rode without event un-
til they reached a turn below which
there stretched downward a sheer drop
of several hundred feet terminating in a
chaotic heap of broken stone

  suspecting nothing until this instant
kioga heard the voice of meru speak

the word that checked the mount they
rode together and simultaneously felt
the prick of metal near his spine

  merus voice was in his ear get
down and do not turn or i will run
my kuri through you

  kioga obeyed without a word

  your weapons throw them on the
ground the other ordered and again
kioga acceded avoiding the temptation
to resist now turn about said meru

  wherefore such great precaution
meru kioga asked in hope of gaining
a moment of time  tis clear that you
intend to kill me though why you
should i do not know

  you know too much answered me-
ru think you that we should let you
live to carry back to semya the fact
that we have lost our quarry life is
too good you die that he may never
learn of it

  but he will learn that you have mur
dered me

  when i have done no one will ever
know that you have gone look behind
you brother your bones will all be rent
apart when your body strikes below i
shall not even hear it fall so deep is that
valley but enough of talk prepare to
die

  with the words meru fixed his eye
upon the point below which beat kiogas
heart the snow hawk did not flinch
and meru paid him one last compliment
you are a bold one brother i must
admire you but life means much to
me and so prepare    now i

chapter xv

in mahris splendid house upon the
main road in the city of the kings
the handsome noble sat wrapped in bit-
terness  what had galled mahri so deeply
was a remark purporting to have been
made by loalli herself that if it came
to choosing between the noble mahri
and the slave who had saved her from
the maddened bull her choice would fall
upon the slave and not the noble

  whether a true quotation or not young
mahri well knew the candid high-born
loalli to be quite capable of saying it
and raging inwardly he swore to find
that long-sought slave of whom she spoke
so highly loalli should have her wish
he promised himself grimly but the
slave when she received him would be
less well-favored than on the first oc
casion
kioga of the unknown land

  since his new servant akra was not
available mahri called into action sev-
eral trusted employees of longer stand-
ing and set for them the task of run-
ning down all clues concerning that
elusive slave promising a thousand kids
to whosoever found him had mahri
known that akra and the slave were one
and the same person he would have
trebled that reward but he did not
know nor did munro flashpan tokala
or myself who sat in on these confer-
ences all unconscious of kiogas huge
deception and completely convinced by
now that he was dead

we had the freedom of the city by
this time a freedom which each of
us made use of in his own peculiar way
tokala when he went abroad was ever
accompanied by a heavy guard who bore
him in a curtained palanquin as was the
custom of the high-born who desired to
pass through streets too narrow to ad-
mit their mammoths along his route he
daily received such cheers and adulation
from the throngs as left no doubt about
his popularity he acted well his or-
dained part emerging unspoiled through
these demonstrations

  ylashpan with a faultless nose for
gold and kindred treasure roamed here
and there in search of the sources which
supplied the royal goldsmiths with the
metal which they worked he took with
admirable ease to this new life among a
strange and half-barbaric people his
sole regrets were for his faithful dog
nugget and that companion of his
checkered past the almost human little
rhesus monkey placer lacking his old
pistols with which he was a dead shot
flashpan soon acquired no mean skill
with the native kuri causing some em-
barrassment to us by neatly skewering
one of mahris own warriors who dared
to tweak one of his long mustaches

  munro following his scientific bent
gave his attention to deciphering the
ancient manda records translating
these he gained knowledge of their stag-
gering antiquity for if the facts re-
corded thus were true the temaho were
proved the oldest race on earth a hu-
man fragment of well-nigh incalculable
age survivals like their mammoths of
the glorious age of mammals

 when early european man was rising
from the twilight of the ages to defend
himself against the beasts with his first
clumsy hand-ax men of manda had al-
ready learned to work meteoric iron

  when egypts ingenuity six thousand
years ago was still at work reducing pic-
tographs into phonetic signs to form a
written language the simple and ingeni-
ous manda form of writing had already
been in use for centuries scribes of that
far-distant day in egypt had been com-
pelled to cut their thoughts in stone the
old-time temaho had even then known
the use of ink made from the soot upon
his cooking-pots mixed with gum and
water and applied with a split and
pointed reed upon the thin but lasting
membrane of a mammoths stomach

  munro could not well connect the liv-
ing men of manda with the incas or the
aztecs since the latter had been of uni-
formly dark skin and eyes whereas the
temaho varied in complexion and so
he hazarded the guess and wrote it in
his notebooks that they might be the
root-stock of the famed mound build-
ers surviving where their continental
cousins had vanished

that penchant on the part of flash-
pan for getting into trouble often
took our thoughts from scientific sub-
jects it had become flashpans habit
in the endless round of seeking hidden
treasure to visit daily with the manda
barbers smiths hucksters menders and
men of trade-gossipers all-who might
throw light upon his search

  in one deep drinking-cellar he was al-
ready by way of being one of its best
customers imbibing freely of the native
mildly stimulating lohe the drink had
the effect upon flashpan of but quick-
ening his already active wit and for all
his years flashpan had now acquired
quite a reputation as a fighter and a
comical eccentric on whose words men
had but to hang if they desired to laugh
not only men indeed

  for in the land of manda as in other
earthly realms the drinking-places have
their share of loitering women of these
one in particular returned a smile to
flashpans shameless ogling having
learned not much of value from the men
with whom he spoke flashpan con-
vinced himself aided by a swift glance
at the ladys pleasant person that he
might gain knowledge of the kind he
sought from her

  but what he learned put from his
mind all thought of gold and treasure
it left flashpan for once without a
word to say albeit his head was full of
leaping thoughts that tumbled on each
other confusedly-for from the womans
lips loosened by the lohe with which he
plied her flashpan had a tale straight
from the den of thieves over which one
ameeg presided

  one of ameegs own men with whom
she had been friendly had blurted out
the fact in an unguarded moment that
ameeg had abandoned his lucrative ca-
reer of thieving and turned instead to
politics-had joined forces with a former
slave named akra and- but flash-
pan interrupted there

  his name was akra didst thou say 
akra indeed but what of that
it is a common name

  mayhap mayhap what did he look
like this slave who could make a thief
turn honest man

  oh tall the woman answered vague-
ly and very handsome-until ameeg
painted on his other face

  but why-his other face

  he had escaped the dungeons of the
slaves

  the gulp of lohe flashpan had taken
all but choked him

  the dungeons of the slaves he
echoed when how did they paint
him

  upon the day the nobles came she
answered adding a good description of
the mask kioga had worn since the
hour he quit the den of ameeg her
facts but served to plunge flashpan the
deeper into speculation now that he
had a grain of hope he scrutinized it
with suspicion loath to reveal to munro
and the others what might later prove
to be without foundation yet here was
something not to be let go until investi-
gated who better could inform him
further than that sly cutpocket of
whom the woman had spoken-ameeg
the thief 

ascertaining where ameeg might be
 sought flashpan thrust a handful
of coins into her fingers and bustled out
upon the street his carry-chair with
which all higher members of mahris
household were provided was ready and
waiting flashpan leaped spryly in and
snapped quick commands to his bearers
who conveyed him down into the close
and foggy warrens in the lower city
haunted by such as old ameeg

  he felt his chair set down and raising
the curtain poked forth his head turtle-
wise to look about him in that forbid-
ding place and sniff the air distastefully

  highness has arrived one of his
bearers murmured deferentially

   highness bah  growled flashpan
and set foot gingerly upon the pavement
be off the lot of you i shall return on
foot his gesture sent them on their
way their copper ear-bells jingling

flashpan stood alone amid an utter
silence peering round about him in the
shadowed doorways and hidden coverts
then he took a metal coin and dropped
it on the pavement waiting a head
thrust from an upper window

 what do you want who come by
night with such a clatter

  i seek ameeg the thief

  there came a jeering laugh from up
above who seeks him not  a metal
grate slammed with a ringing crash
flashpan indignant walked on a way
he tripped upon a foot thrust from a
doorway ho there cried the little
miner dragging forth a man who lay
within get up direct me to the
thief ameeg

  would that i could he has just
picked my pocket the other said

  your foolish fault for letting him
come near said flashpan

  be careful warned the other he
will hear your coins rattle	

   tis what i wish if only i may come
upon him said flashpan proceeding on
his way and jingling his kuls at every
step for in the lower city of the kings
there is a truthful saying that when
money rings it is like the smell of mam-
moth-cheese to rats but to flashpan
it seemed that all the rats were keeping
to their holes he went unchallenged
and saw no one until at last having put
his money-bag away he came upon a
hunched-up figure weeping on a door-
way touched flashpan drew near

  why do you cry my little one he
asked in the soft manda tongue

  i have been robbed croaked the oth-
er with a fresh outburst of sobs

  ameeg flashpan demanded fierce-
ly and when the others shoulders shook
he is an ogre this vile pocket-picker
but never mind here is to console
you- he reached in for his money-
bag to find it gone he-yaf i like-
wise have been robbed again this
ameeg 

 again ameeg agreed the other
quietly rising up to bow in mock def-
erence holding forth the while flash-
pans money-bag and showing his seamed
old face at last you search for me
wal ill be cussed  exclaimed flash-
pan that shore was slick


kioga saw tlie bridge sag
and slip    then it gave
way completely precipi-
tating both beasts and men
to eternity

v



i

your pardon queried ameeg with
a leering grin

 i said flashpan replied that i had
 long desired to meet you

  tis done what do you want of this
 poor thief



  there was a slave who recently es-
caped-

  ah 

  his face was painted to resemble
some one else -
ah

   tis known that ameeg harbored
him and for that act there is a penalty
a head stuck on a pole is not a pretty
sight

  especially if it be ones own said
ameeg

  you catch my meaning admirably
thief said flashpan speak straight-
ly and your secret shall be kept where
is this man whom you call akra

  i do not know said ameeg turning
up his palms expressively he is the
only one who ever could elude me and
my many eyes

  before you painted him-

  he had a handsome face a little mole
below one ear and on his back a long
faint scar from hip to shoulder

  flashpan arose mustaches quivering
with excitement he tossed ameeg the
bag the thief had returned your words
are worth ten times this sum he said
and shaking little ameeg by the hand
well meet again

  i hope so said ameeg in wonder
gazing at the money-bag   

  wheezing after his hurried return to
mahris house flashpan burst in upon
munro and me as if a war had been de-
clared and broke the news excitedly
kiogas akra akra is kioga hes
alive shelp me he works for mahri
oh didnt i tell ye that cat had nine
lives that rumor of his death among
the blue book magazine

the slaves was bunk and having
dropped that shell among us flashpan
sat down in near-exhaustion

  it clicks said munro to me

  what dye mean clicks  said flash-
pan

  we had an inkling of it from an-
other source i answered for munro
and postponing explanations led flash-
pan through the crowds which now
camped perpetually on mahris door-
step we paused some streets away
and entered a low doorway in a shadowed
alley flashpan following me upon my
knock repeated in a way agreed upon a
door was opened within a dimly light-
ed room an old man stood who greeted
us in the manda tongue and told in
substance before flashpan what he had
earlier told munro and me

 my name is mingo one of my
guards helped me to flee the slave-dun-
geons while there i met and talked
with kioga he was not slain but
escaped my robe his only cover

 how came you to be in the dun-
geons demanded flashpan

  i am a shoni part of the outer world
like you my mother wandered here be-
fore my birth when i was still a child
she told me by what route she came be-
neath the mountains my memory is
good i wish to see my fathers land be-
fore i die if you will go with me may-
hap i can show the way of your escape
flashpan turned to me

  if kioga was alive why didnt he
give us some sign of it when he came to
visit mahri lookin like a soldier of the
temaho 

  he must have had a reason i re-
plied perhaps he feared we might un-
wittingly betray him well hear from
him when he is ready meanwhile well
act as if we didnt know he was still
alive and go with mingo if he can
show us the path his mother used we
shall be ready any time kioga is

chapter xvi

upon a mammoth bearing the fore-
head shield of mahris stables we
entered the deep sub-mountain burrows
of the temaho free from interference
and with our path made smoother by
that identifying sign but unhappily al-
though he led us accurately for a way
old mingos memory finally proved at
fault so that the route his mother long
ago had described to him must be lo-

cated if at all by sheer deductive rea-
soning on our part

  we were compelled to think back to
our first entrance into the hermit king-
doms of the temaho seeking to choose
from among the many abandoned bor-
ings that one which most nearly paral-
leled our route of entry logic said
that since the mother of old mingo had
been one of the shoni people she must
have made her way into this area north
of her ordinary haunts by some route
other than the tombs which had present-
ed to us such obstacles as no lone woman
could have overcome

since mingos aid was exhausted we
chose at random one of the nearest
tubes closed off by rough-hewn barri-
cades bearing a royal seal forbidding
further labor here by linking our great
mounts chain to the lower logs we thus
could swing the barriers far enough aside
to give us ingress

  the tunnel which we followed ended
in a solid wall coming forth from it
we likewise tried out several others of
varying length eliminating one by one
from consideration as that through which
a stranger from the outer world might
have passed

  we came at length upon a barrier so
long untouched that its lower logs lay
under several inches of rock-dust enter-
ing here we found a lane of many turns
and branches following its main artery
to the farthest end we saw this time not
solid stony wall but a chaotic mass of
tumbled rock evidence of the greatest
hazard which the excavators ever faced
a cave-in of many years ago

  having actual knowledge of the sever-
al branches of the abandoned tubes and
recollection of the route which we had
followed upward through the tombs it
developed from our calculations that this
old tunnel pierced the rock not far from
where we and kioga had passed but
though we suspected such proximity lack-
ing means of boring farther we could
conceive no way to bring it to a proof

  but suddenly our movements in and
near the fallen rubble sent a darting
shadow bounding almost from beneath
our feet one fleeting glimpse was all
we had of that quick-moving form but
that sufficed it told us that the shoni
forests could not be far away not farther
than that creature could have wandered
searching for a place to den for what
we glimpsed had been a panther cub
half-grown of a variety we had seen a
kioga of the unknown land

dozen times while roaming in kiogas
native wilderness

  along some such route perhaps this
very one old mingos mother must have
passed seeking perhaps escape from
some great hunting-cat only to fall cap-
tive to the race who had tunneled here
before the cave-in had occurred to force
a discontinuance of the work

  following on the heels of the disap-
pearing animal as far as crevices in the
rock would permit we brought up at
last against a junction of the walls
through which we could not squeeze

  awhile we toiled exerting all our
strength upon the mammoth-goad seek-
ing to pry the rocks apart that we might
follow through our labors were in vain

  we paused returned to refresh our-
selves with water from the leather bag
hung at our mammoths shoulder then
once more crouched before the crevice
to study out some means of enlarging it
that this gave exit to the forest beyond
the kingdoms of the temaho we had no
doubt since through the crevice faintly
came the scent of pine and hemlock

and suddenly with straining ears and
 tilted head flashpan listened he
herd as we did from a distance yet
with perfect clarity the sound of sing-
ing our blood ran swifter in our veins
we knew that stirring chorus-the chant
that fell from shoni warriors lips in-
deed we even thought we recognized
the leading voice for that of kias bound
to the snow hawk by the closest ties of
friendship flashpan let forth a yell

 kiasl can ye hear me kias
silence followed and he called again
without result another pause ensued
while we listened for the answer which
would put us in contact with our friends
beyond the hermit kingdoms of the
temaho but only the hollow echoes of
his own voice returned to mimic him

  some freak of the acoustics in these
under-mountain caverns enabled us to
hear them but were our own voices be-
ing diverted elsewhere could they
hear us again flashpan signaled but
not now with his voice instead he
whistled on a low peculiar note which
echoed and reechoed in those tortured
caverns the sound of chanting ended

  flashpan crouched before the crevice
with a tense expectancy and now a
sound did come a sound which i had
heard somewhere before in my travels
without being able instantly to identify
it it was shrill and growing in in-

tensity the explanation darted into
mind but not before the reality was
among us

  the shrill sound multiplied and then
became embodied in a leaping shadow
which sprang through air alighting on
flashpans shoulder placer the monkey
hugged flashpans skinny neck screech-
ing and chattering monkey confidences
into flashpans hairy ear whereas a
man might not pass through the narrow
clefts between the solid rock this little
keen-sensed creature had heard his mas-
ters call and easily passed among the
crevices our contact with the outer
world had been established

  yeve got a lot to say grinned flash-
pan stroking his active pet but its all
over my head now if ye cd tell us
how all our friends be out in the forests
of the shoni- flashpan paused his
blue eyes calculatingly asquint mebbe
ye cant but you can let em know were
still alive and miss la salle at leastll
be glad to know her man is still around
i saw at once flashpans intent to
make the agile little rhesus act as courier
between ourselves and whoever were be-
yond the reach of our voices upon a
strip of skin torn from his overrobe he
scrawled a penciled message to which i
added my name it read

  we ben try in to git through the mountin
  an all air alive an kikin whats what out
  thair with you look in placers collar fer
  this note send us an answer same way

  flashpan tied the note flag-like to
placers collar and faced him in the di-
rection whence he had come the bright-
eyed little animal well knew what was
expected of him but was loath to leave
the side of his master so lately met with
after so long a separation several times
he started off glancing back to see if
flashpan followed each time he re-
turned with deep perplexity written on
his wrinkled simian face but flashpan
had a way with animals presently the
rhesus went back into the crevice and
did not now return

in silence listening we waited all our
hopes pinned on that agile flitting
little form which bore our message to
our friends outside for though the
kingdoms of the temaho were large
enough for an entire race to us they
were a prison as prisoners waiting for
reprieve from their surrounding walls
so now we crouched expectantly an
hour passed and two before the long
high call of placer sounded once again
and like a ghost he swung into our pres-
ence

  inside his collar was an answer writ-
ten on a strip of thin white bark in lieu
of paper flashpan unrolled it and by
our smoking torches we read

in vestments of the royal

house ilasli pan bo re him-
self with comic majesty
from his hand a chain led
back to an albino mam-
moth-calf on this lesser
mammoth sat tokala the
king-to-be

your message received where are you
what can we do to help you now and
then we hear a heavy thumping which
seems to come from deep within the earth
are these your efforts to escape or what
longer message being prepared good luck 

dan la salle


  they hear a thumpin in the ground
said flashpan swiftly the temaho
are gettin nearer to the end of their
tunnelin one of these fine days theyll
break through an when they do well
make our get-away well sure have
news for munro but we cant linger
here our place is in the tunnel of the
temaho if were to leave the land of
manda

  we sent one last note to our friends
advising them of our intentions dis-
patched the note by monkey-courier and
went as we had come we thought to
join with munro and tokala to be on
hand when the slaves holed through the
tunnel then to escape and meet our
friends beyond the mountain wall which
had until now held us incommunicado

  well for our strength of heart and
courage that we could not foresee events
that yet remained between our hopes of
liberty and their realization 

for what had occurred in the world
outside during our adventure in the
land of hermit people i am indebted to a
record kept with utmost faithfulness by
beth la salle with her permission i
am free to quote from it

  placer flashpans little simian pet
faithfully returned to them with our last
message telling of our safety and the
nature of our strange captivity

 dan who received the message at
once relayed it by shoni indian runner
to his sister beth and turned his full at-
tention to the sounds of distant digging
emanating from somewhere deep within
the mountain-side it was an eerie sen-
sation to listen to those muffled thuds
and know them made by living men
who knew of but had never seen the
world beyond their peak-girt kingdom

  the sounds were intermittent but in-
creasing in volume until one day they
ceased entirely as if all work had been
abandoned and this was true in fact
occasioned by the threat of cave-in which
required full attention to the bracing of
the tunnel ceiling

  three days of silence passed but dan
did not sit idly by to dig through solid
rock toward the sounds with the poor
tools at his disposal was not practicable
instead he dnd his men attacked the
stone at likely points of cleavage these
they enlarged and deepened several fis-
sures leading sotnewhere inward until
dan could crawl in and with sound from
outside thus eliminated listen to better
purpose

  upon the fourth day thumping recom-
menced continuing without a further in-
terruption time and again dan sought
to gain attention from the unseen exca-
vators by blows struck with a heavy
stone against the rock he tapped in
morse of which he had a working
knowledge in hopes that munro also fa-
miliar with that code might hear and
so communicate but his efforts met
with no success

  undaunted by his failure dan made
other preparations intending to blast
a way toward his missing friends he long
ago had cached a good supply of powder
brought up from downriver to this a
stroke of luck had added several sticks
of dynamite stolen by one of his in-
dians from the mining-camp headquar-
ters of the pirates gold-seeking company

  of powder dan packed a quantity in-
to the inmost crevice of the rock nest-
ing in the blackish grains the sticks of
high explosive ingenuity provided dan
with fuses made of twisted cedar-bark
which he had moistened dipped in pow-
der then set out to dry into the ex-
plosive core he introduced the ends of
two fuses then with a buckskin blanket
covered it and weighted all with dried-
out sand and stones brought from the
river achieving thus a tolerable mine
which could be detonated from a dis-
tance by setting fire to the fuses

  such preparations made dan kept his
vigil the rumblings beyond grew hour-
ly louder now and again it seemed to
him that other sounds came through the
rock sounds as of great horns hard
blown-no doubt the trumpetings of
laboring mammoths and finally-this
time beyond all doubt-the sound of hu-
man voices raised in mighty unison fol-
lowed instantly by hours of silence

while dan kept watch one of his
red-skinned runners who made liai-
son between the divided parties in the
shoni forests brought news down at the
miners camp all was bedlam and ex-
citement gold had been struck in quan-
tity that men had never dreamed about
before three full canoe-loads had been
taken down the river sack by sack to
their waiting ship the pirate and there
been melted into rough ingots and stored
aboard

  this preoccupation of the hostile min-
ers with the hunt for mineral treasure
worked to the advantage of captain
scott and his men who thereby went
unmolested during the building of their
the blue book magazine

craft now well advanced the frame-
work of a little ship already stood erect-
ed like a skeleton on which the men
were now at toil attaching rough-hewn
planks and reinforcing stringers for
sails they intended using the deer-skins
brought m by the red-skinned friendlies
and cut and sewn together at the block-
house by beth la salle her father and
the men there stationed

  so much and little more did dan know
of events out near the coast for since
kioga flashpan and munro with to-
kala and me had vanished in the moun-
tain caverns dan had not once relaxed
the search for us

  one fact gave him cause for constant
apprehension internal strife had long
existed in the savage shoni nations the
flash of scalping-knives was reported
with a growing frequency his runners
told of war-bands moving on the rivers
freed of ice by an early spring thaw
and the blockhouse down the river lay
directly in the path of such scalp-hunt-
ing parties

  worst of all news came from the min-
ing-camp there had been firewater
killings and retaliations several cruel
atrocities had been perpetrated by the
miners on red-skinned visitors to their
camp a number had been shackled and
forced to labor in the miners frenzied
search for quantities of gold and the
shoni now thoroughly aroused against
the whites would not discriminate be-
tween their persecutors and others with
pale skins

  all the more cause reflected dan to
stand by to aid the snow hawk and his
friends if aid were needed in the final
piercing of the rock for with kiogas
knowledge of the indian mind chances
of safety were vastly multiplied

  and with dan waited kias lifelong
friend of kioga who had persuaded near
a score of shoni braves to join him in
his vigil they speculated on what man-
ner of men would presently come forth
and what was happening to us

chapter xvii

kioga was not the man to let him-
self be slain without a struggle
yet on the narrow ledge he had but little
room in which to make a stand

  as merus blade licked forward ki-
oga dodged evading it by very little
margin and with the movement slipping
abruptly until he had but hand-grip on

his ledge now he was utterly at merus
mercy had not a kindly fate intervened
for drawing back to thrust a second
time a whiplike blow across one cheek
distracted meru accidentally flicked by
his mammoths swishing tail it was a
sharp and painful cut and angrily he
kicked the beast behind him full against
one of its ankles which was red and sore
from scuffing on the long up-trail

then meru returned to his job of
murder-and an instant later yelled
in terror for a hairy trunk had curled
around his waist then with a mighty
swing the mammoth catapulted meru
screaming into space his yells grew
fainter as he plummeted

  kioga hauled himself upon the ledge
one eye upon the mammoth for fear of
being dealt with likewise by the pain-
crazed brute instead he heard it sob-
bing wheezily infallible indication that
its rage was past and glanced into the
void below far down he saw a dark
misshapen lump bound from a jutting
ledge-the last that any man would ever
see of meru

  kiogas eyes came up attracted by a
moving train along a mountain trail far
in the distance and coming toward him
they were as ants so far away yet his
keen eye made out a mighty host of men
and brutes undoubtedly the minions of
semyas city bound for the city of the
kings to put him on the throne by force

  kioga mounted on the beast which had
been merus and retraced his earlier
steps to the bridge across the gorge its
chains defied his strength he hitched
the ponderous mammoth to their rings
and urged it forward

  up on the winding trail above the
vanguard of the mounted warriors ap-
peared and glimpsing what he did
rushed down with threatening yells

  the second staple broke away kioga
drove his beast across the bridge now
resting only by its weight upon the side
he quitted chained to a timber of the
bridge kiogas bull strained mightily
hauling it within the fraction of an inch
of slipping off the other ledge but there
it somehow jammed

  the oncoming foreguard thundered
out upon the bridge two abreast until
the weight of four great mammoths
tramped on the quivering structure
turning to unhitch his beast before es-
caping kioga saw the bridge sag with
the weight it bore and shortened thus
slip from its distant seat
kioga of the unknown land

  mens yells and shrill wild trumpet-
ings of mammoths mingled the bridge
sagged farther unable to advance along
its steep incline the brutes slid back-
ward until their combined weight was
all at that weakened far end one of
the warriors sprang from mammoth-back
to safety on the road above his head be-
fore the bridge gave way completely
precipitating beasts and men to eternity

  stunned by this severance of their
artery of war semyas soldiery gathered
opposite kioga the gorge and dangling
bridge between the snow hawk wheeled
his brute and sent it on from the other
side a heavy war-spear hurtled shod
with meteoric iron it struck kiogas
brute a glancing blow and clung but did
not pierce the mat of hair

  kioga snatched it up and hurled it
back with better aim to strike its owner
squarely in the breast then urging on
his mount he started down the trail
part of the enemy still remaining to be
passed there was not time to replace
his earlier disguise which ameeg the
thief had contrived and by which they
would recognize and give him way yet
he must attain the city of the kings to
inform mahri of the danger threatening
inthe mountains he must also contrive
that those ahead of him did not attain
the city

  encountering that earlier war-train he
joined them offering their leader a fabri-
cated message from the forces in their
rear you are to wait for them upon
the river-bank all will approach the
city of the kings at once with show of
mighty force a messenger will greet
you at the gates and give you further
orders

adding thus to uncertainty kioga
 hastened on arriving at the river
he beheld amid its murky fogs six of the
broad flat river-boats with semyas
shields nailed at their peaks waiting to
bear the nobles men-at-arms

  avoiding these kioga turned upriver
swam his mount across and paused be-
fore the city gates

  i am from semyas city he an-
nounced i bring news of disaster to
his army delay me at your peril gate-
men 

  this threatening response was well
conceived for cunning semya could be
counted on to post men friendly to his
cause at such a strategic point the
gates swung in kioga passed through
swiftly he had not gone a hundred

paces when his name was called he
glimpsed a crooked form-the thief

  ameeg your face is pale you
tremble

  not for myself-for you my friend
ten of semyas men are seeking you
the pick of his best fighters tis well
you have returned without your old dis-
guise they know you only as akra the
warrior or you would have been slain
before the gates dismount be not
conspicuous

it was good counsel kioga obeyed
abandoning his mammoth and min-
gling with the crowds wherefore such
multitudes he inquired

  -it is the coronation day ameeg re-
plied tokala is to be crowned within
an hour if the spies of semya do not
kill him first

  your men the snow hawk ques-
tioned hastily

  i have but twenty faithful left of
one of them i am not sure semyas
wealth has bought the rest and more
than half the nobles too all is lost-
well be dead men my friend  wailed
ameeg dismally

  not yet bear up good thief do
not forget that mahri is our strong ally
commanding many men the snow
hawk thought swiftly come with your
men into the hall of state well armed
beware of semya muttered ameeg
swiftly one of loallis chamber-slaves
told him that you were the slave who
saved her from the mammoth and later
marked his face forever with its scar
he will remember you beware
this for black-hearted semya kioga
answered slapping ameegs kmfe-blade
sharply the thief grinned fiercely

 twill be a pleasure tell me when
place yourself near him at the first
sign of treachery strike hard and true
i go to mahri luck to you friend
and to you also murmured ameeg
as kioga quit his side

  the coronation march had begun hast-
ily kioga neared the hall of state its
doors had all been taken down to open
the great hall for these historic ceremo-
nies crowds milled before the portals
and densely lined the street down which
the royal procession presently would
come

  within the foremost nobles attended
by their slaves and glittering in rich
white robes of royalty sat on the ornate
chairs which flanked the central golden
throne
  semya was there he gnawed his lips
his face was pale with pearls of sweat
upon the brow well kioga knew the
turmoil that was in him with all plans
made to foil the nomination of tokala
the force which he had counted on was
not available since the soldiery from his
home city had not yet arrived another
hour or two would see tokala king with
power to destroy him at a whim the
other conspiring nobles shared in his
frustration

mahris seat was vacant as was lo-
allis kioga met mahri entering
the hall of state to take his seat and
stepped before the noble to tell him of
events upon the highroads out beyond
the city as if he saw a ghost mahri
checked kioga noted it but spoke out
quickly that no time might be lost

  semyas warriors will soon be at the
gates he knows that i am in your
service and faithful to the king-to-be
tokala be warned and ready for what-
ever comes see that the boy is guarded
watchfully i shall be near if worst
should come to worst

  mahris lips were white so thou art
akra slave at first and false warrior in
the second place now i remember thee
who stepped between loalli and her bull
and later bore my gifts to her to bring
no answer back i did not know thee in
that other ugly mask

  this is no time to talk of gifts and
maidens said kioga sharply withqut
the deference which mahri would de-
mand semyas men  tell you will
undo your making of a king if it is pos-
sible i have delayed their army on the
road eluding the assassins semya put
upon my trail but the army may find
another route and so undo my work

  thy tone is sharp-nay insolent
complained mahri through lips that
trembled strangely i like it not i
say i like it not his voice rose to a
note almost hysterical kioga startled
by the change in him cast quickly
through his mind for some good reason
for it he had not far to search

  he knew that mahri loved the noble
loalli if it had come to his ears that
she had scorned his gifts and spoken of
love and power to one who seemed to be
a slave in mahris own employ the deep
affront of such a thing would rankle like
a mortal wound that only could ac-
count for mahris sudden change of face

  kioga was aware of deadly danger in
this circumstance but mahri outward-
ly controlling his emotions swept on to
occupy his place among the seated nobles


as he sat down a slave from semyas
retinue bowed in obedience to an order
and left the hall in seeming haste

  all eyes now turned upon the entry
o loalli never more strikingly beau-
tiful she slowly strode toward her seat
aware of mahris eager eyes devouring
her yet utterly indifferent

  attempting to depart unseen by her
kioga saw her stop and stand at sight
of him a glad expression on her face
he moved away again she checked
him wait they said you were in
danger wounded killed-that semya
sought to murder you    why did
you not come back to me

 he cautioned her do not delay
there is no time for explanations now
the horns blow for the entry of the
little ru he is in peril as are all of
us do not dismiss your guards

 i am a noble you order me yet
i obey because-because i am a woman
said loalli with her eyes upon him soft-
ly do you need warriors my men
would follow you-

 a sound of chanting drowned her
words kioga waved her on she went
head proudly high again to her chair

the roll of rhythmic chanting rose to
shake the ground kioga stood aside
to watch the slow unfolding of scenes as
from the old arabian nights three
score of finely muscled slaves strode into
view bound wrist to wrist and limb to

several of the nobles careless
of whom they trampled were
dragged down and killed

limb in chains of clinking gold they
were the symbol of the nations servitude
to its new king

  behind them came as many golden-
bodied girls free maidens of the upper
class each likewise chosen for her beauty
and magnificence of form and bearing
these symbolized the choice which any
manda king may have among the mar-
riageable maidens of his realm each
bore a snow-white pigeon in her hands
which as she passed between the double
rank of slaves she cast aloft to circle in
the great rotunda dome above

  now came men of the upper class and
lower nobility in mammoth-leather suits
of scarlet and bright orange upon each
wrist a sable hawk was perched blind-
folded and bound by a leash of silver
chain and wearing silver bells about its
ankles these passed between the rows
of slaves and maidens standing then to
either side in token of submission by
the rich to their new ruler

  came next the royal soldiery with
kuris bared and flashing marching to
the alternating roll of drums with buck-
lers and helmets agleam by torchlight
these paused before the open doors of
the great hall to act as protectors of the
peace during the coming ceremonies and
hold the throngs in bounds

  watchfully kioga eyed these disposi-
tions taking note of everything trans-
piring the face of semya was now
calm but pale mahris was a study in
the blue book magazine

conflicting passions his eyes ever and
again upon loalli who sat unperturbed
and cool between the other nobles gently
wielding a hawks-wing fan

  the rat-a-tat of drums and sound of
chanting slaves increased and mingled
with them was the trumpet of approach-
ing mammoths now splendor reached
its brightest height a train of beasts
hove into view albino mammoths of the
royal stables their ears were hung
with sparkling jewelry their thick
white outer hair was twisted into looping
scalloped braids under which the inner
wool lay curled and curried till it glis-
tened their curving tusks were carved
blue ivory inlaid with threads of silver
and of copper torchlit they glowed as
beasts of living gold requiring no other
ornament each with its trunk swung
up and down a smoking ivory censer
whose heavy perfume hung along the
streaked air their bare-skinned ma-
houts checked them just outside the por-
tals and ranged them in an open row

  between them now came one afoot
whom kioga knew in stunning vest-
ments of the royal house flashpan bore
himself with comic majesty though trip-
ping now and then upon his overrobe of
saffron-colored mammoth wool he car-
ried a shield of yellow metal inscribed
with the heraldic coat-of-arms of the
manda ruling house this would be
handed to the king on his accession in
lieu of head-crown according to an an-
cient manda usage

in his other hand flashpan held a
chain which led back to a pink-eyed
mammoth-calf also albino its silk-like
hair dressed and decorated with all the
artistry of the royal manda grooms
cross-legged on this lesser mammoth sat
the king-to-be tokala his message-hawk
before him on the richly polished leather
saddle the beast he rode would be his
own for life to grow with him and bear
him through his realms his robe was
made of iridescent overlying feathers
open at the breast to show the flashing
golden plaque of office

  behind him one to either side strode
munro and i who had been with tokala
on his entry to the kingdom and so were
rated worthy of the honor of escorting
him

  at glimpse of him the multitude sent
up the roar of their approval breaking
through the restraining cordon of war-
riors to surge about tokala eager to be-
hold the person of their young ruler

  foremost among the crowd and blank-
ing out the others from our notice stood
one the rumors of whose fate were set-
tled now forever kioga stood there by
his living presence raising from our minds
all fear that he was dead

  tokala with a yell of gladness would
have leaped down from his perch but for
the snow hawks voice close by re-
member you are a king kioga said
in english comprehensible to ourselves
alone act like a king tokala heard
and obeyed-composed again although
joy and excitement surged in him

kioga turned to us who rushed to
greet him lost for words to show
our joy that he was still alive i cannot
express what fresh and reassuring con-
fidence surged up in me to know that he
was still with us working for a reunion
with our friends which we all craved
despite the pagan mummery we acted
out to save our skins he did not leave
us time to talk

  go through with this he told us
shouting to be heard above the roaring
press on every side watch out for
semya keep tokala closely covered
once he is actually king it will be tgo
late for them to harm him loalli is on
our side but all the rest are hostile i
shall be near in case- he sought to
tell us more but now the soldiery had
controlled the mob again with it he
was hurled back the march moved on
tokala with ourselves as escort neared
the empty throne dismounting just be-
fore it the nobles rose to honor him

  a warrior clove the slender chain in
half with one blow of his kuri tokala
mounted and sat in the empty place
flashpan stood waiting with the shield
of kingship

  his action was the signal for a sudden
silence a heavy gong rang deeply with
a brassy tone the men of wealth and
low nobility unbound their hawks drew
back their leathern hoods then at a
signal all the hawks were freed to rise
with beating pinions high above the
swarm of milk-white pigeons

  swift then were the vicious blows with
which the killer-birds struck and struck
again all the silent court was filled
with sound of jingling bells as the
sharp-beaked hawks struck down the
fluttering pigeons

  when every hawk had borne its victim
down and covered it upon the stones the
owners came to gather in their taloned
hunters retiring to their several places

kioga of the unknown land

  a cry went up

  thus may the little ru strike down
his enemies 

  this ceremony ended loalli rose re-
ceived the royal shield from flashpans
hands and presented it to tokala with
the ritual words o ru long absent
now returned the ninety-seventh of thy
line long may this shield defend thee
whom we shall acknowledge by our hails
as king may thy rule endure for many
decades may the maidens of thy choice
one day give thee many sons to carry
on thy line may thy mammoth herds
be multiplied i give thee homage hail

  her voice rang clearly in the silent
hall of state and that of mahri and of
several others followed promptly until
only semya was unheard from his
voice alone was now required to make
tokala king unanimously

  tall semyas glance leaped through the
crowded hall as if in search of some one
his brow dripped sweat there came a
rumble of condemnation at his delay for
mahri had well established his puppets
popularity and the people hungered for
a ruler of the old king-line

  uninformed of their delay and hourly
expectant of the arrival of his warrior-
jorce from the mountains by which to
execute a coup semya did not dare de-
lay his answer longer the word came
out of him reluctantly yet it was clear-
ly heard the one word hail which
made tokala king

a moments deep hush ensued be-
fore the storm of accolade which
would follow then suddenly a cry rose
somewhere amid the throng slaves of
manda rise and strike the outer
world is reached we shall be free to
spread our tribes upon the outer earth 

  in the ears of all who heard the news
seared like a white-hot flame here for
the hermit race of manda were the
tidings for which they and countless
generations of their ancestors had been
laboring down the centuries

  for slaves here was new freedom
for royalty new fields for power and
conquest

  and for ourselves the prisoners within
a captive kingdom here was escape back
to the world and friends we knew re-
lease from this strange mummery to
which we lent ourselves perforce

  kioga his eyes not upon the ceremo-
nies but on that slave of semya whose
shouted rumor had been intended to dis-
rupt the ceremonies lashed swiftly out

to fell the shouter in his tracks but
now the winds were loosed the nobles
ever fearful of just such consequences of
their cruel misrule were frozen momen-
tarily all save tall semya and loalli

  the wolf-faced noble leaped with kuri
drawn to skewer mahris new-made king
probably intending later to justify his
act by proving that tokala was not of
the royal blood of which his spies had
only recently informed him

  tokala raised his shield to fend the
blow but loalli was yet quicker her
slim hand moved as the lightning strikes
there was the flash of metal as she drove
her dagger home and semya wheeled
with blood afroth upon his twisting lips
to cut her down

hardly had loalli endangered her-
self by striking to save her youthful
king when from behind there sprang the
figure of ameeg the thief supported by
his score of nimble-fingered and well-
armed rascals ameeg swung swiftly up-
ward with a long and heavy blade he
carried the nobles kuri shivered on the
stouter weapon and then ameeg sprang
wolflike at his throat snatched out the
metal loalli had planted in the nobles
breast and plunged it back repeatedly till
semya stirred no longer

  and now suddenly out of the milling
press kioga appeared to join ameeg and
throw a ring of armament about tokala
the boy-king things moved with speed
when guided by his judgment kiogas
voice rose up above the din the king
protect your king

  among the throng were some not yet
insensible to loyalty of these a number
rallied to us making a clear way out of
the desecrated hall of state we caught
a glimpse of loalli separated from us by
a milling mob moving rearward to an-
other exit well guarded by her warriors
and slaves most of whom were loyal to
her kindness

  of mahri i saw nothing i never
dreamed-but of mahri more in its place

  kioga had thrown his robe about
tokala to hide the royal vestments from
too-covetous eyes now on account of
violence and rioting we were the safer
for being afoot and inconspicuous sev-
eral of the lesser nobles favorable to
semya had taken to their mammoths
seeking to ride through the press of hu-
manity in the streets careless of whom
they trampled in their rush for sanc-
tuary a roar of fury followed them and
some were dragged down from their
mounts and killed by infuriated relatives
of those they had trampled

  the royal soldiery disorganized by
rumors of a contact with an outer world
were derelict to duty as mercenaries
anywhere are wont to be in times of
crisis they had disbanded scattering
to rejoin each other when they chanced
to meet but offering no serious threat to
the menace of the mob

led by ameeg to whom the byways
j of the city were familiar as its
runways to a fox we found a safe retreat
at last in an old abandoned subterranean
slave-keep near the great outdoor arena
and it was here by special courier-a
thief in ameegs service-that we learned
the irony of these events and the depths
to which the treacherous semya had
sunk reports of contact -with the out-
side world were false and baseless sem-
ya had created them out of whole cloth
in order to prevent another from be-
coming king but his slave had bungled
matters delaying his outcry until too late

  you speak with certain knowledge
demanded kioga of the messenger

  i have just spoken to tali the over-
seer fresh from the workings in the tun-

nel to see a new king made he left his
slaves laboring to brace the ceiling of the
tunnel which threatens to collapse near
its far end

  here was information which we must
believe since tali of all men was best
qualified to speak on tunneling it was
a moment dark with disappointment for
each one of us

  and still from afar the roaring of the
tempest which the rumor had unloosed
mounted steadily in volume

  to take stock of the altered situation
kioga left us going out into the city of
the kings

  with kuri loosened in its scabbard
the snow hawk strode the troubled
streets and turned toward the wall where
by this time there should be some sign
of the warrior forces approaching from
the hills he felt that since the mass
of them did not know what end they were
to serve he might divert them to join
with mahri and loalli in a strong al-
liance to support the new boy-king and
subdue the growing uproar

  he neared the city gates one point
still held by the old authorities and sud-
denly glimpsed mahri being admitted to
the challenge platform from which pa-

the wol f - f a cod noblcleaped
to skewer the new-made
king tokala raised his
shield to fend the blow
but ixalli was yet quicker
laver may be held with friends or foes
beyond

  kioga thought to hail the prince but
had one fair look at the nobles face
mahris features were lined and pallid
the eyes deep-sunken feverishly ablaze
as if an inner fire were consuming him

  warned in time kioga let him pass
unspoken and mounted atop the wall to
where he could command view of the
challenge platform on which the other was
emerging below kioga also glimpsed
the warriors and beasts arriving after
long delay before the city gates he
heard them call identities demand ad-
mission mahri answered in a deep yet
penetrating voice

  he whom you came to serve is dead
a new king has been made who has no
drop of royal blood in his veins i am
not rich as was semya but if you help
me overthrow this false impostor each
man shall be a leader in my realm and
there shall be no kings hereafter re-
fuse and it is death to all of us 

all that mahri had wrought he now
 sought to destroy the young boy-
king the ruling class and all established
government must fall if he succeeded

  s

here was a rouser of rabble incarnated
faithful to no friend or party the arch-
type of nihilist who would throw down
all things to serve his private ends-of
jealousy and love of power

  near to the snow hawks hand ar-
ranged one on another in wooden racks
were numbers of the sickle-bladed molas
he had seen upon the forges of the arm-
smiths razor-sharp except at one short
gripping-place kioga took one up and
poised it eyes upon mahris shoulders
just behind the neck from up above at
such close range a well-directed throw
might easily behead the faithless noble
in his tracks and the realm would be
well rid of such a traitor back went
kiogas hand the mola glittering bright-
ly the muscle on his shoulder twitched
but suddenly he paused assailed by
doubts about his right to kill

  after all he had dined at this nobles
board and served him well while they
were friends kioga put the mola back
unable to bring himself to strike thus
thug-like from behind    he would re-
gret his failure to destroy this mahri
before the day was old
the blue book magazine

  kioga heard the leader of the forces
shout back his acceptance of mahris
terms and heard the noble call throw
wide the gates  came then the rumble
of a lifting bar as a warrior inside leaped
to obey there was a louder clang as the
long broad bar dropped back the war-
rior fell speared from behind the
slaves in roving through the city had
reached the gates at last

  mahri aware of something going wrong
vanished from the outside platform re-
appearing yelling frantically for the sol-
diery to put their beasts against the
gates and force them in but already
the slaves as if led by one versed in the
arts of war had braced the gates with
timbers to withstand assault of any kind

  balked in attempts to rush the sol-
diery outside ranged their tall beasts
up close to the wall then from their
large equipment broke out crude flexible
ladders made of mammoth leather and
wooden scaling devices swift though
they worked they were outwitted by an
active figure on the wall above who
when the hooks upon their ropes took
hold immediately cut the strands and
when their ladders were upraised pushed
one after another backward laden with
climbers who sprawled in howling confu-
sion on the slope before the city wall

  kioga could not long hold the top
against the multitude beyond but aid
came swiftly in the form of one he knew
and well remembered-one who had first
befriended him and taught him how to
drive a mammoth

  tahro cried the snow hawk and
the other met him with a hard quick
grip of friendship as he came a stream
of slaves appeared to man the wall

  my men said tahro swiftly in ex-
planation

  you lead the rising slaves to liberty

  or death i know not which tahro
replied but we shall at least die fight-
ing to become free men ah see them go
to battle

it was a scene kioga found worth
watching the attacking soldiery now
better organized had planted broader
ladders at the walls securely and stormed
with valor suited to a better cause they
came up two by two in twenty places pre-
senting helmets and breast-of-metal to
blows the slaves rained on them with the
arms kept on the parapets for such emer-
gencies the wall was as a ship between
two waves-the one of naked slaves ar-
riving from within the other of the

storming soldiery-which met and crested
in a whirl of fiercely fighting men

  the soldiers were outnumbered but-
more suitably equipped their heavy
swords sheared naked slaves almost in
twain their armor turned the hardest
blows but its weight encumbered them
whereas the slaves light on their feet
as cats could leap and circle nimbly
waiting for the chance to run their kuris
deep into any vital unprotected spot

  now back now forward surged the
battle on the wall swift as the flight of
hawks glittering molas whirled through
air and where they struck no helmet
or armor could withstand their force and
deadly keenness fast as the soldiers
mounted even faster came fresh levies
of slaves to take the places of their fallen
comrades and force the fighting until the
last attacker fell

kioga struck no blow save occasion-
ally in his own defense his life was
necessary to another cause than this con-
tention of the slaves and former masters
when he departed from the scene the
slaves had dominated throwing wide the
gates at last to admit the weakened
enemy laying hold of them as they came
in diminished by the number of fallen
stormers and slaughtering them without
compunction

  the whirlwind now was in its fullest
power turmoil pandemonium reigned
within the city walls the city was like
some giant anthill overturned as from
every dungeon liberated slaves poured
forth a wild and pitiless horde unleashed
upon the ruling classes it now was gen-
erally known that rumors of a contact
with the outside world were nothing more
than rumors yet though the slaves had
struck prematurely their gains were
great already they held half the city
many of the nobles had retreated to their
cliff-side houses easily convertible to
fortresses and here were in a state of
siege surrounded by their faithful

  near the open theater arena where the
carnivals were to have been held the
former rulers still held out and partly
dominated for it was near here that
mahris fighters had assembled and ral-
lied joining with the men-at-arms of oth-
er nobles

  much of this kioga saw or learned
when presently he rejoined ameeg and
the rest of us who anxiously waited his
safe return we learned of mahris treach-
ery with sheer dismay for on his forces
we had counted to the last now he too


kioga of the unknown land

was an enemy the bitterer for the per-
sonal motives that drove him

  yells from without foretold fresh mis-
fortune one of ameegs thieves burst
in to give us warning mahri and his
warriors seek the new boy-king hide
him away before they come

  kioga bounded to his feet at that and
turned to ameeg

  you ameeg he said know some dis-
tant exit from the dungeons underground
lead on you-munro flashpan kirk
tokala-follow ameeg quick now
five of ameegs men accompanied us
as their leader picked a way through
these tortuous mazes which rival the
famed parisian sewers in complexity
men have been lost for weeks in these
blind passages and we saw skeletons to
prove that others had been lost forever
there undoubtedly these died from lack
of water but ameeg knew the passages
as the old romans knew their own deep
catacombs and led the way toward safe-
ty without a slip or one false turn

  with the remainder of ameegs men
kioga waited to defend our rear or to
throw mahri off the scent as necessity
dictated how readily and confidently
men did his bidding i thought as we left
him they were caught up and drawn to
him as by some strong magnetic power

  mahri himself was one of those who
came in search of us he found his
entry disputed by kioga and a dozen
resolute thieves each one of them skilled
in the art of thrust and parry it was
with some astonishment that they be-
held mahri accompanied only by a small
military bodyguard

      e wait to serve you said kioga
      coldly as they neared

  with kuris or in friendship observed
the noble softly as with hurt feelings

  whichever you prefer kioga an-
swered your friendship like your
dagger has two edges

 your men outnumber mine said
mahri speaking swiftly i come to seek
your aid not to do injury

  out with it then what aid is it
you want of us

  mahri made great show of frankness
things go not well with us the slaves
are almost in control the noble class is
doomed its warriors scattered out of
the strife will come another government
join with us to support the new boy-
king

  that from you-who not two hours
since called on semyas minions to enter

and destroy him as an impostor  kioga
answered with ironic reproach

  mahri bore his thrust with equanimity
you overheard me speak tis true
i frankly do admit it but i was over-
wrought by the uprising my words were
not my own and i repent call on me
for the proof of this repentance

  it rings deceitfully kioga answered
but put down all your arms in proof
he added distrustful more than ever but
well aware that mahris strength of war-
riors might still be advantageous to us all

the noble and his men obeyed unhes-
itatingly whereupon kioga and his
men came forth for parley the nobles
gaze passed over them he talked at
length of plans and purposes-at too
great length kioga thought art vague
he answered brusquely at last get
to the point and quickly

  the point is reached said mahri
with an undertone of triumph which ki-
oga caught at once you are all my
prisoners

  prisoners one of the thieves re-
plied with derisive laughter on his lips
but suddenly his laughter died stopped
by a flying mola that struck him from
behind two others of kiogas men
dropped where they stood the snow
hawk took one glance behind and knew
the worst

  one of ameegs own men must have
betrayed this hiding-place to mahri for
from behind out of the very exit kioga
and his men had used a file of mahris
warriors came armed to the teeth

  mahri smiled sinisterly his voice
was soft with purring triumph as he gave
orders to his men seize that one
pointing at kioga kill the rest

  the grim work done before his eyes
cold-bloodedly mahris laughter bubbled
in his throat for you-to the snow
hawk-i have a better entertainment
waiting i would loalli could be here
to see thee dance he made a sign

  all entered where so recently the new
boy-king had hidden and by dark pas-
sages came toward the open-air arena
catching as they did the reek of wild
beasts from the forests of the realm
whose snarls and growls reechoed in the
lantern-lit darkness they bid thee
welcome said mahri to kioga mean-
ingly

  a patch of light appeared beyond a
full moon lit the great arena brightly
showing its oval enclosure high polished
walls surrounding it on every side and

the blue book magazine

rising twenty feet beyond were tiers
of empty seats

  shalt run before a silent gallery
muttered mahri and to his men throw
him in

  a moment said the snow hawk
give me some arm to make a fight of
it twill make it better worth your
watching

  i came to see thee flee and scream for
mercy not to see thee fight was mahris
contemptuous answer and to his war-
riors down with him why do you
wait

  the warriors obeyed but before he
fell kioga seized a lance and kuri from
the nearest hurling it below a moment
later he found himself upon the earth
within the wall with mahri and his men
looking down on him worked by a
chain manipulated from the wall one of
twenty traps was slowly rising behind
gaunt with starvation and long confine-
ment a shadow rose upon hind legs ki-
oga knew it for a pit-bear from the hills
chosen for its savage disposition and
formidable armory of claws and curving
teeth more deadly than a tiger

  the pit-bear dropped down to all fours
and came out with a raging impetus
straight at the crouched and muscular
figure waiting to defend himself

ameeg had taken leave of us to
 search for food in places known to
him munro and i sought rest and sleep
weary from this days activities one
of the thieves among our company stood
guard though we were in little danger
of discovery

  tokala not yet king for a day alone
was wakeful it had been through these
very mazes that jemmu the city urchin
had lately led him to view the penned-up
beasts and slaves kioga was somewhere
behind perhaps in danger round about
him were the snores of weary men the
single sentry nodded taking frequent
swigs of lohe from his ivory flask

  tokala turned sat up the sentry
took no notice tokala gained his feet
the man was breathing heavily thanks
to the mildly potent drink tokala passed
behind paused to pick up a lantern then
quietly slipped away as he had come
skirting the skeletons with averted eyes

  he heard a sudden multiplying up-
roar of the beasts followed by mocking
laughter and a voice which sounded much
like that of mahri whom he had always
known as a friend which cried well
dodged now at him beast

  tokala bounded forward glimpsing
through a barred opening the sight of
man and animal contending in the arena
with mahri and his warriors applauding
from the wall the bear made short
and vicious rushes finding at each charge
the keen blade of a lance which pricked
him on the head and shoulders then
suddenly tokalas blood ran cold for
he who faced the animal was kioga

  again the pit-bear charged and to-
kala turned in frantic haste-not to de-
sert his friend but to summon help

within the dungeon chambers to-
kala ran on flying feet somewhere
near were allies could he but find them
and enlist their aid he cried out loudly
slaves slaves whom i fed when you
were starving reply to me

  this way this way  a deep voice
answered

  stumbling tokala found a door on
which someone was pounding he raised
its outside bar the door swung in the
faces of the slaves no longer emaciated
from starvation were unfamiliar but
he was known to every man of them-
the little ru who had not been too proud
to visit them and now had come to keep
his second promise that of freedom

  a roar of acclamation rose the
slaves destined to be nobles sport salut-
ed him in leaping words he told of
what transpired in the near arena

  a burly hearty ruffian tossed tokala
on one shoulder and led the rush up
toward the wall which skirted the arena

  other ears had heard tokalas cry
flashpan munro and myself alarmed
by his discovered absence had traced
him and encountered those whom he
had summoned to his aid we joined
them bursting out upon the wall a little
distance from where mahri and his com-
panions were engrossed in baiting an-
other living human being

  the slaves just liberated by tokala
crept stealthily upon the other party
under cover of the wall i know not
what munro or flashpan did but speak-
ing for myself i was transfixed i never
shall forget the dreadful terror which i
felt beholding our stanch friend in his
extremity the bear indeed he had
killed but mahri had ordered loosed
against him four of the great dire wolves
his back against the wall kioga was
fending them off but even the tireless
snow hawk was gasping in exhaustion
and the four fearsome beasts pressed
ever closer
kioga of the unknown land

  and then i saw that even in this ex-
tremity he had kept his wits about him
for he was edging along the wall toward
the door of the wolves own dpn and
now he made a furious berserk sally be-
fore which the wolves gave ground then
whirling like a flash kioga leaped into
their den the trap fell heavily behind
him like hammer blows against the
wood he heard the hard impacts of the
baffled beasts as they were stopped short
by the heavy bars

  again from up above the cry of
mahri rose imperiously then terror
fury and surprise were in it also kioga
caught the sound of shouts the impact
as of bodies falling in the arena and
cruel laughter from the wall

  he looked out through a ventilating
hole to witness mahri rising to his feet
his face a waxen mask of horror a cry
of dread was in his throat yet passed his
clenching teeth in but a whisper his
own fierce harriers baffled by the sudden
disappearance of the other prey knew
nothing of discrimination-and shriek-
ing mahri was their victim he went
down threshing like a stricken animal
his heels beat a hard tattoo against the
trap which hid kioga

 a fellow-man was being rent and torn
beyond kiogas sanctuary one who had
sought his life with an unparalleled fe-
rocity by every tenet of right or justi-
fied revenge kioga should have stayed
his hand instead assailed by pity he
raised the trap a foot and seized the
stricken mahri by the ankle intending
to haul him from the jaws of the wolves

  but suddenly the snow hawks grasp
was broken by a fierce tug from beyond
the snore of snarling tight-locked jaws
told him that he was too late

  we who beheld the grim finale from
above turned sick from the spectacle
not so the slaves who loosed the other
captive beasts to join the dire wolves

  but though we turned away sounds
followed us-mens voices being choked
off the crunch of cracking bones

the snow hawk emerged from the
dens to join us on the wall that over-
looked the arena hardly had he greeted
us when yet another company of slaves
leading nobles in their clutches arrived
upon the opposite edge of the arena and
threw their victims to the beasts

  such was the indication of the general
temper tokala representing nobility

at its highest was now endangered too
the time had come to make our bid for
liberty the route toward it led through
the city of the kings toward the tunnel
in the mountain

upon the tide of slaves ebbing and
flowing in the streets we could con-
trive best by seeming also to be slaves
to achieve that end we put off outer ap-
parel obtained from mahris wardrobe
and wrapped ourselves in ragged cloaks

 with ameeg and his men for com-
pany we set forth through the troubled
city riding on three mammoth laboring-
bulls which were provided by tahro
thus masquerading as toilers bound for
labor in the tunnel we slowly neared the
opening scenes on the route informed
us what we might expect were we recog-
nized as attendants of tokala who still
was king though fleeing his domains

  with the scaling ladders originally
used by the soldiery in attempting to
force the wall and others improvised up-
on the spot the slaves were now engaged
in bitter warfare against their former
masters who had taken refuge in their
sumptuous cliff mansions defending
them with desperation from the former
slaves who climbing by ladder and
agility sought to oust them to the
clutches of the mob

  some of these lesser strongholds al-
ready had fallen slaves paraded from
them in the finery seized at the time of
victory or fought about division of the
spoils others looted in the households
of freemen smoke and fire told of un-
controlled incendiaries at work

  a wild shout rose upon one side of us
a band of scaling slaves had just gained
ingress to a nobles dwelling from a
neighboring house the defenders made
their stand upon the topmost balcony
in full view of the cheering throngs up-
on the streets the naked ravagers at-
tacked hurling their unlucky victims to
the stones a hundred feet below there
was the crash and roar of destruction
within the cliff-side mansion then some
one hurled a torch and smoke began to
curl from every orifice

  pillage terror and destruction held
the beautiful city of the kings in thrall

  i could but wonder where was the
lovely noble loalli now how many of
the other nobles would survive this holo-
caust  i did not realize as yet the deep
astuteness of that high-born princess

still more desperate hazards lie ahead for kioga dont miss the great
climax of this epic series of novels in the next-the august issue


iqllers snd

by william p lawson

i was cutting firewood in back of
water canon station one morning
when buck pettis emerged from the
house and walked slowly over buck was
the ranger to whom i had been attached
some three weeks before on my arrival
in arizona to learn the duties of a forest
service field man

  the super buck saidjest called up
on the phone says clay ellis has been
pesterin him about his homestead claim
wants we should ride over and make a
survey and report on it today

  buck seemed disturbed and i won-
dered why i had heard of ellis re-
putedly a plumb bad hombre and
suspected of more than one unavenged
killing but i could not see why that
should cause buck any present worry

  id ought to scale some logs over to
the sawmill this morning buck went
on reckon you could make a metes-
and-bounds survey and draw up a report
on the ellis claim by yourself 

  dont see why not i replied

  my companion seemed distinctly re-
lieved he got out instruments helped
me pack them on my horse and sped me
cheerfully on my way

  the quarter-section in question lay in
a draw some ten miles south east of
water canon i followed a forest serv-
ice trail that led up and over an inter-
vening ridge which culminated farther
south in ware peak where the fire tower
for this part of the apache was situated

  when i reached the claim i found
that it lay on a gentle slope heavily tim-
bered except for a cleared acre or two on
which stood a log cabin a spring gushed
from a rock ledge near by and made a
little stream that trickled down the draw
a pleasant spot but not a homestead
possibility for forest service policy held
that such claims to pass muster must
be more valuable for agriculture than for
timber

  smoke rose from the chimney of the
cabin i pulled up before the door which
opened as i did so a big man of forty
or thereabouts stood on the threshold
peering at me with a scowl holding a
carbine in the crook of his arm

  i lost no time in introducing myself
and stating my errand ending with the
request that the man whom i assumed to
be ellis would show me the nearest sec-
tion corner if he knew where it was

  git down he said in a grating voice
ill show you the cornder soon as i git
my boots on

  he wore patched overalls and a grimy
shirt his face was swarthy with
aquiline features and high cheek bones
matted black hair fell over his eyes and
down to his shoulders in back i stared
fascinated as he sat on the doorsill and
pulled on down-at-the-heel boots won-
dering vaguely whether the soil that
caked his person had been gathered ex-
ternally or was working outward from
some earthy core within

 whats wrong with buck that he
didnt come  the homesteader demanded
as he rose and stamped one foot and the
other

  i had an idea by this time what ailed
buck but i merely explained that the
ranger had other and pressing business
to which ellis replied nothing he strode
off to the section corner in silence nor
did he speak while i ran out the line of
the hundred-and-sixty acre tract he
sought title to

  but when i was through and preparing
to leave he asked abruptly

  you aimin to git the claim for me
it isnt altogether up to me i make
a preliminary report-

  ellis broke in impatiently

i know all about that its what you
figure on putting in your report im ask-
ing about the super claims that has
right smart to do with my getting title
i nodded thinking quickly

  im asking what youre fixin to do
feller  my interlocutor demanded the
menace in his voice was unmistakable
he had shifted the muzzle of the car-
bine till it pointed toward me

  you cant run that bluff mr ellis i
said ill do what i think is right



real
wifes high moments of adventure are de-
m j scribed in these true stories contributed
by our readers for details of our real ex-
perience contest see page  first a forest
service man tells of a tough citizen with
whom he had to deal-and of an indian who
took over the job in his own peculiar fashion

  im not bluffing by god he as-
serted

  appraising him-somewhat less calm-
ly than i pretended-i was prepared to
admit that he was sincere in this claim
it occurred to me that the situation was
one needing the practise of diplomacy

  you can kill me i said slowly any
half-wit with a gun could do that but
it wont get you the homestead and thats
what youre after isnt it 

  are you sayin youll get it for me

  i shook my head not promising
but while im alive youve got a chance
otherwise none at all why dont you
wait till you hear the result of your ap-
plication if the news doesnt suit you
-well ill still be here

  for a long minute the squatter stared
turning the point over in his mind then
evidently deciding that i was saving face
and would do what he wished he nodded
shortly and lowered the gun-muzzle

  ill wait and if you know whats
good for you youll see i get the claim
savvy 

  i said i savvied repacked my instru-
ments and took the homeward trail

during the ride i had plenty of time
to think over the jam i had got in-
to thanks to bucks astute manipulation
of events for it was plain now why the
ranger had wished the job onto me

  i wondered if it might not be wise to
ride in to town and acquaint the super-
visor what had transpired but upon
arriving at the station i found him there
in conference with buck who looked sul-
len and ill-at-ease

  they were leaning on the corral gate
when i rode up the supers saddled horse
standing near by

  he seemed glad to see me

  howd you make out  he asked

  i told him and he frowned

  lucky you got out with a whole skin
ive just been jumping buck for sending
you over there alone

pebiences

  he dont have to live here reglar
muttered buck you got to stand in
with fellers like ellis i wouldnt put it
past him to sneak up here and drill
somebody if he got on the prod-or set a
woods fire

  the super stared disgustedly

  youre a hell of a ranger-afraid of
a little lead

  i aint afraid insisted buck dogged-
ly its just that i figure my healths
worth more than a jag of govment land
ive seen too many fellers out here get
kilt over nothin much

  the super said nothing for a moment
he got bucks point it was clear men
in the southwest at that time didnt reach
 green old age by hunting trouble with
admitted killers

  suddenly the super turned to me
ive been thinking id like to use jim
hoyt-whos at the fire-tower-in town
for a spell like to go over with me now
-stay there while hes gone

  the suggestion surprised me but i
nodded assent

  if buck will lend me a horse to pack
my bed and duffel-bag over on

  shore said the ranger promptly
take ary one of my critters you want
the trail the boss and i took was the
same id used that morning as far as the
shoulder of ware peak where we turned
south up the ridge we rode slowly in a
walk most of the way through thick
stands of pine and spruce timber sud-
denly he swung sideways in his seat and
turned motioning to me to come closer

  ellis said the super without pre-
amble wont make any move till he
hears from his application by then ill
have something figured out so you wont
get in trouble in the meantime you can
stay on with hoyt at the lookout camp
itll be a good chance to learn that kind
of work


real experiences

  but i thought you wanted hoyt in
town i said

  that was just talk what i wanted
was to get you away from water canon
buck wouldnt do anything but worry as
long as you were there-afraid clay
might call

  he broke off gazing ahead at the trail
which for a mile or so had been winding
up the ridge as we reached the top i
saw the fire-tower ahead and at its base
the log cabin where the look-out lived

  a dogs bark sounded sharp on the
frosty air

  thats hoyts dog hector the super
vouchsafed both of em right good
folks

  we entered a clearing of an acre or so
of fairly level ground with the tower and
cabin in the center walking toward us
was a slender sinewy boy of about my
own age a large dog trotted at his heels

  got a new recruit for you jim said
the boss as we rode up

  he introduced me explaining the situ-
ation briefly hoyt shook hands grin-
ning his gaze was candid and direct
i felt at once that we would get along

on the morning following my arrival
hoyt proposed a ride

  theres a spot we cant see from the
tower he explained over the ridge
yonder-the canon of las animas its
called so we keep a fire-guard there on
the rim with a telephone connection so
he can call here if a fire starts i like to
drop in on this guard every once in so
often mind

  i professed myself pleased with the
plan and we started off after breakfast
on the way hoyt asked casually

  you like snakes-rattlers

  i stared i can do without them
why

  hoyt smiled faintly nothing only
encarnacion-the fire-guard-may have
one or two around he makes pets of
them

  but-whats wrong with encarna-
cion 

  my companion grinned hes a hopi
one of the tribe that uses snakes in their
dances he claims they act right friend-
ly if you treat them right but what i
was getting at you better not start a
fracas with one of encarnacions com-
padres if you happen on it he wouldnt
take it kindly

  shortly afterward we swung past the
face of a steep cliff and came to a ledge
overlooking a deep gorge

  theres las animas canon hoyt
said indicating the gorge and yonders
encarnacion 

  i glanced ahead and saw an indian
boy of eighteen or so stretched full length
on a rock in the sun gazing out over the
timbered slopes before him

  lying there motionless he seemed part
of his surroundings as if indeed he
and all natural things-rocks trees run-
ning water and the creatures of the woods
-were animated by a common soul

  as our horses hoofs sounded the boy
glanced around then rose with a single
graceful movement his black eyes fixed
on us unwinkingly

  howdy encarnacion hoyt said
this is the new senor who is staying at
the look-out camp with me

  the boys gaze shifted but he made no
comment

  no fires i reckon asked hoyt

  a shake of the head answered him

  clay ellis up to anything new

  it was as if the words touched a spring
instantly the indians impassive features
twisted in a scowl and a stream of span-
ish words fell from his lips

  hoyt turned to me frowning

  dont know as the boss told you but
he left word for encarnacion to keep an
eye on ellis and ellis came up this way
last night the trail here branches off
and leads down to his claim you can
see it to the left there-way below

  i followed his pointing finger and made
out the homesteaders cabin visible in a
pocket of the foothills to eastward

  i glanced at encarnacion once more

  whats the boy so worked up about 
i inquired

  seems ellis stopped at the ledge
hoyt returned and one of those snakes
i was telling you about appeared and
clay shot its head off thats one reason
i reckon we havent seen any reptiles
sunning themselves today

he spoke to the boy again in spanish
asking additional details of the home-
steaders visit i supposed soon we left
hoyt appeared preoccupied i asked
him after a time what was on his mind

  he shrugged

  encarnacion says ellis rode up to the
look-out station last night-he followed
his tracks afterward and i keep won-
dering why clay didnt stop in to say
howdy it doesnt look right well
have to watch that fellow closer from
now on i told encarnacion to telephone
if he comes up again


killers end

  the days that followed were idyllic-
crisp mornings warm noons long fire-
lit evenings with always the odorous
scent of pines in the air and the wide
outdoors for a work-room together
hoyt and i worked on fire-trails climbed
the ladder of the fire-tower to the look-
out platform at intervals wrangled
horses cut wood cooked and ate hugely
slept the sleep of the dead-lived in an
existence remote from what i had hith-
erto regarded as actuality insulated from
the world i had always deemed real

we were cleaning up one morning
after breakfast when the phone-bell
rang hoyt answered it talking at length
when he reappeared he was smiling

  imbrie he said in answer to my
look of inquiry what do you suppose
hes done

  i shook my head

  the letter came from washington
turning down ellis homestead applica-
tion and the super instead of wishing
the job of telling ellis on us rode out to
the claim himself and gave clay what-for
told him hed heard about his war-talk
and that hed have to pull his freight right
now-got the drop on him and made him
pack and hit the trail riding with him till
he got clean off the forest and was headed
south for clifton

  i couldnt help but feel relieved by this
news i hadnt consciously worried much
over the homesteaders threats but its
never pleasant to imagine some one may
start shooting with oneself as target if
the mood strikes him

  hoyt went on

  another thing not quite so good the
super wants me to come in and help him
in the office reckon you can make out
here alone all right now clays left
he looked concerned a fact which
irked me slightly id learned the look-
outs job pretty well by now and for the
rest felt myself a seasoned woodsman
why not i retorted

  ill leave the rifle and hector hoyt
added just in case and theres the
phone if anything happens

  i cooked and ate supper and cleared
up afterward then piling wood on the
fire i stretched out with my pipe for a
smoke before turning in hector who
missed hoyt also and had followed me
about mournfully all day lay across from
me now his head on his forepaws gazing
into the fire   

  i was knocking out my pipe prepara-
tory to turning in when hector raised his

head suddenly and growled low in his
throat his hackles lifting

  what is it hector i asked think-
ing that some woods animal had ven-
tured near the clearing

  the dog giving no sign that he heard
rose and moved stiff-legged toward the
wall of woods across the glade i leaped
to my feet and started for the rifle that
stood behind the cabin door at that
moment a gun cracked in the woods op-
posite and a bullet fanned my cheek

  i stopped short staring at the spot
whence the shot had come hector was
racing across the clearing as i stood
the gun sounded again and the dog shot
forward and fell in a heap i ducked and
ran for the cabin

  i was safe there and could watch the
starlit glade from door and window but
the sight of hector wounded and trying
feebly to crawl back for aid made me
forget caution seizing the rifle and
stuffing a pocket with shells i emerged
from shelter and started toward the dog

  as i passed through the door the
hidden marksman fired again and the
bullet smacked into the door-frame be-
side me checking abruptly i dropped
to one knee and emptied the magazine
of the repeater toward the place whence
the firing seemed to be coming then i
reloaded hastily and ran to hector

  to my relief no more shots came in-
stead i heard a sudden scramble of hoofs
and their receding tattoo down the south
trail that led to encarnacions station

  hector was bleeding badly and i had
trouble in finding where the bullet had
gone in then i saw that it had struck
the dogs shoulder and plowed along his
side a gory but not a mortal wound

i took the dog in my arms and car-
ried him to the cabin where i washed
and dressed the ugly gash as well as i
could i was putting the finishing touches
to the dressing when the phone rang

  the welcome voice of encarnacion
came over the wire

  the senor jeem he said is he
there 

  i told him hoyt had gone to town and

he said

  the senor ellis have come back
his horses tracks go toward the look-
out-

  hes been here i broke in pot-
shooting at me hes riding back down
be careful encarnacion

  there was a pause then the boys
voice came again
real ex

  he have start a fire in the canon i
go now to fight it will you come to
help

  sure i said the escaping home-
steader promptly taking second place in
my thoughts soon as i can get there
luckily the pinto was hobbled and
easily caught i saddled and bridled
him and with a last look at hector took
the south trail at a lope and soon joined
encarnacion in the work of fighting the
flames

  the fire was small luckily scarcely
an acre in extent and before long we
had brought the blaze under control

  when the last spark was out i told
encarnacion what had happened at the
look-out camp he nodded

  the senor ellis is bad hombre he
commented

  what gets me-hoyt says imbrie rode
off the forest with him and warned him
not to come back

  again the boy nodded

  i see the sefiores ellis and imbrie
leave this morning and i theenk the
senor ellis will come back-

  what made you think that
  encarnacion shrugged

  i watch he went on without an-
swering my question and tonight when
the fire start i come down careful so
i make no noise i hear a horse on the
trail above i look up i see the senor
ellis riding toward the fire-tower and
i find his horses tracks down here where
the fire start that is when i go back
to the ledge to phone the senor jeem
and you answer

  do you think theres a chance wed
find ellis at his cabin he was head-
ing that way

  encarnacion shot me a quick look
may-be he replied tonelessly
well i decided im going down
there on the chance anyhow you can
come or not as you wish

  i weel go too said the boy

we set out in single file encarnacion
on foot in the lead i followed on
horseback with the gun across my saddle
for a time the boy took the cattle-trail
down the canon bed then swung left
and entered the trail from the top that
led to the nesters claim he said noth-
ing nor did i as we progressed in an
hour or less we had entered the draw
where stood the cabin we sought

  the door of the shack was closed but
through chinks in the logs a yellow gleam
shone stronger than the starlight a

little to one side a saddled horse stood
head lowered as if tired

  the senor ellis is there whispered
encarnacion nodding toward the shack

  i dismounted and crept forward hold-
ing hoyts rifle ready the indian fol-
lowed noiselessly we stopped before
the door listening all was silent

  im going in i muttered and pushed
the door open

  by the light of a candle-stub on the
table i saw the homesteader sprawled
face downward on the floor before the
hearth a hand was stretched toward the
hearth in which a hole had been made
by removing a large adobe brick by the
hole lay a tin box fallen on its side

i took a step forward calling ellis
name there was no answer nor any
movement of the body on the floor i
moved cautiously toward the prone fig-
ure and leaned turning the head the
features were swollen and distorted

  i drew back feeling slightly sick the
tin box caught my eye taking it up to
my surprise i found it half full of money
gold and bills-loot no doubt from some
earlier adventure outside the law

  i looked at encarnacion the boy
had turned the body over disclosing the
puffed features he pointed to two
small punctures in the neck near where
the body joined it

  i stared at the indian his eyes were
gleaming a look of exultation lay on
his copper face then as he caught my
look his face went blank he said slowly
it is where a snake strike sefior my
friends the snakes do not love one who
keel them without cause

  i thought quickly why had encarna-
cion said awhile ago in the canon that
he had expected ellis to return unless he
knew of the cache the ranger had re-
turned to retrieve with vengeance on my-
self a side issue how had the boy so
speedily discovered the snake-bite un-
less he expected to find it

  my thoughts reached out i saw en-
carnacion spying on the ranger watch-
ing ellis gloat over his stolen hoard i
saw him knowing the nester would re-
turn dig up the box and leave one of the
small mountain rattlers there-death for
the unwary outlaw yet how could one
prove the facts

  they were never proved no charges
even were made against the indian
but ellis the killer had been slain by a
youth whose nature was as ruthless and
more subtle than his own

you dever can tell

hen we camp tonight we will
cache the food in the trees
clint had a way of saying things
like that and never vouchsafing an expla-
nation and when i asked questions i
never knew what kind of a reply i was
going to get he might just grunt or
again it would be just blank silence
sometimes he would give me a con-
temptuous look as much as to say
lord how do dumb people like you ever
get into the woods anyway

   clint was an old dear for all his grum-
piness he would sit back with his silent
chuckle when i got into some kind of
greenhorn trouble like trying to eat
skunk berries thinking they were wild
currants but his eyes were always open
to see that i did not get into serious
trouble that was his business-a pro-
fessional guide and prospector wet
nurse he sometimes called himself with
a gesture of contempt

 my husband was trying a back to
nature treatment for a bad back a sou-
venir of the war a canoe-paddle in his
hand all day and a pack on his back over
the portages was his idea of medical
treatment clint had served under him
in the war and he treated my husband
like a spoiled son he just tolerated me

  sometimes i took an extra paddle in
the canoe but more often i sat there
trailing a line overboard catching fish
for the evening meal for the portage i
had my own pack weighing thirty pounds
with shoulder-straps and tump-line clint
could carry over two hundred pounds
with his tump-line and my husband got
to where he could do almost as well

  we were heading north for james bay
four weeks out of dane our last railroad

contact larder lake abitibi lake
bear lake and so on north-lakes and
streams paddles and pack we had be-
come adjusted our boots were broken
in our faces were covered with fly dope
that smelled to high heaven but did help
to keep off the little pests i had tried a
mosquito-net over my head but found
that it only suffocated me the dope
was tough on the complexion but it was
better than the flies

  we hang the food in the trees

  i pondered over that statement of
clints we were going upstream around
white water packing it a ten-mile por-
tage clint said i mulled the question
over in my mind for a full mile then i
asked clint why do the things have to
be put in the trees

  dogs grunted clint that indian
camp back there on the other side of
the river indian dogs are the worst
thieves in the world

  i didnt believe him no dog could
ever or so i thought swim that stream
with all its rapids-and they were miles
behind us anyhow but i knew that if
clint said things went into the trees into
the trees they would go

  we came to a place where the shore
line opened out into a little park an old
indian camp-ground clint told us all
the pine trees had deep pockets cut into
them and were full of pitch furnishing
material for the repair of canoes indian
birchbark or prospectors canvas birch
wood with its oily bark was plentiful the
ideal firewood for camp making a hot
fire with but little smoke

  it was still an hour before darkness
but we started early in the morning and
camped early in the evening husband
real experiences

unrolled the tents while clint cut poles
i brought water from the stream in
twenty minutes the tents were pitched
my husband was out chopping wood and
clint was busy between the fire and
cleaning fish i was getting the beds ar-
ranged for the night each one of us
had his own task

just before dark another party ar-
rived  two men they were not pack-
ing but were hauling their canoe up-
stream with a harness of ropes they
unloaded and pitched their camp a few
yards from us when i looked at them
i felt like a seasoned veteran they
were sunburned and their faces were
covered with fly-bites little black spots
of blood under the skin that made them
look like freckled freaks their clothes
were unsuited to the trail and though
they must have been in the bush for
some time they had a lot of trouble in
getting their fire started and finally came
over to our camp and borrowed some
embers from ours it seemed their
matches had got wet and they did not
know about waterproof match-cases

  our meal was prepared in clints usual
prompt style we ate in silence lake
trout broiled over the coals the cold
meat of a young beaver which tasted like
wild duck flour gravy with biscuits
baked in a reflecting oven alongside the
fire and our regular dessert of speckled
dog-boiled rice and raisins

  as we sat drinking our tea clint kept
cussing undu his breath and looking over
to where our neighbors were struggling
with a smoky fire finally he gave a
gruff chuckle and turned to me with an
embarrassed grin on his mahogany-col-
ored face lady i guess ive been kind
of hard on you on this trip i was frank
about women being out of place in the
north woods but by golly i believe
id rather have a dozen like you on my
hand than two tenderfeet like them
and with a snort of disgust clint walked
over to the other camp where with a few
well-directed words and acts he straight-
ened out the strangers he showed them
how to rig a frame over their fire so they
could hang their buckets without spilling
their contents and putting out the fire
he showed them what kind of wood to
burn then as an added gesture he told
them how to mix the pine-pitch and
bacon-grease and make a dope to spread
over their faces as a protection against
the black-fly as he left them i heard
him call back tie your supplies to the

tree limbs tonight-hang it high with
ropes away from the dogs and porcu-
pines

  i was down at the river washing my
face when one of the campers came down
with their dinner dishes carefully he
placed them in the water weighting them
down with small stones i watched the
operation with interest thinking maybe
i would learn something new about wash-
ing dishes but the man started to walk
away that was too much for me i just
had to find out why so i asked him

  whats the idea of leaving the dishes
in the water  do you expect the current
will clean them for you

  oh no loidy it aint the water its
the little fishes the little whitebaits
they comes up and cleans the dishes for
us and in the morning theyre all spick
and span smart i calls it

  later when i told the story at our
camp-fire clint mused in silence for a
few minutes then burst into a chuckling
laugh not so dumb not so dumb by
golly ive been in these woods all my
life and never thought of that

for a man who had spent the greater
part of his life in camps clint was a
miracle of cleanliness if we stayed a
week in a camp it was left just as clean
as when we came often cleaner dishes
were washed as soon as the meal was
over clothing was washed as soon as
soiled if husband or i wanted to get a
call-down all we had to do was to throw
a fish-bone on the ground that man
was a camp tyrant but he told me his
story about a dirty camp and then i got
his viewpoint

  i had cached my canoe said clint
and pushed on about twenty miles into
the hills prospecting a range where i
hoped to find gold i killed a moose and
while cutting it up my ax slipped on a
bone and buried the head in the calf of
my leg i tied it up the best i could cut
a stick for a crutch and headed back for
my canoe and supplies it took me four
days to make that twenty miles the
last two or three miles i dragged myself
the leg was swollen twice its normal size
and was looking bad i had no more
bandages so used the old ones that was
my mistake

  by the time i got to my canoe i knew
i would have to get out to a doctor and
get there quick i remember heading
into the white water of a rapids  i
woke up in the little hospital of a wood-
pulp camp they told me i had been


you never can tell

brought in by indians who had been fish-
ing below the rapids i lay in the hospi-
tal for five months clint wound up
while they experimented and talked
about cutting off my leg and all because
i had tied it up with a dirty rag ive
never had a serious accident since but
theres the tin box with clean bandages
and everything needed just in case

next morning we took our supplies
down from the tree-limbs and cooked
breakfast our neighbors were still
asleep they stirred out as we were
packing-and then came howls of grief
they had not followed clints advice or
example about their supplies every-
thing they had in camp that a dog could
possibly eat was gone or destroyed ba-
con sugar even the bag of flour was
broken and scattered over everything

  clint spent thirty minutes with them
gave them a piece of bacon and a bucket
of beans and they headed back down-
stream whipped to a frazzle because they
had not listened to the advice of an old-
timer in the country

  what did you say to them clint
i asked

  i just cussed them said clint with
an embarrassed grin thats about all
some people can understand this north
country is a great place but you cant
fool with her

  we made a semi-permanent camp on
a small lake we fished swam in the
cold water and tried to get pictures of the
moose that came down to the lake to es-
cape the black-flies and to eat the lily-
pads sometimes there were as many as
a dozen moose in the water at one time

  husband was feeling like a new man
clint used to lay him over a log out in
the sun and rub his back until he yelled
for mercy but i got an insight into their
friendship when i heard my husband
say damn you sergeant if i was such
a bad officer that you want to murder me
now why didnt you let me stay out there
in no mans land that time i was
crocked 

  and clint said if id have known
how much trouble you were going to be
i would have left you now lie still and
take your medicine

  that was the first time i ever knew
that clint had won his dcm for pack-
ing my husband in when he was wounded
in a trench raid   

  we had found a patch of raspberries
growing on a rocky hillside one morn-
ing i took a bucket and announced my

intention of picking enough berries for
a pie my husband and clint were going
after trout clint growled

  well i guess you can take care of
yourself but lady these woods are full
of bears so watch yourself

  but theyre not dangerous i coun-
tered you told me so yourself

  all animals are dangerous at times
trouble is you never know when or why
that time is take the rifle with you
just in case and remember bears are
curious if a bear comes near you just
stand still chances are hell look you
over and then go away but be careful
i had my pail half filled with berries
i had worked near the center of the patch
and paused to rest a few minutes under
the shade of a large white birch tree i
set the pail down and rested the rifle
against the tree-it was a twenty-two
high-power i noticed the front sight
was missing it must have got caught in
the brush and pulled out

  i started to move on then i caught a
flash of movement out of the corner of
my eye i turned and there through a
cleared space in the bushes was a black
bear coming toward me with a sidewise
sort of gallop that carried a lot of speed
i didnt think it alarming id seen
plenty of these little black bears since
we came to this country i stood per-
fectly still as clint had told me to do
it worked about fifty feet from me the
bear came to a halt reared up on its hind
feet and looked me over i never moved

a full minute we stared at one anoth-
er i getting more nervous all the
time and the bear swinging its head from
side to side as though unable to make
up its mind then it decided it dropped
down to all fours and i heaved a sigh
of relief then like a flash it was com-
ing toward me again and i could hear
its growls

  i dropped the pail of berries and raised
the rifle then realized that it had no
sight with the rifle raised i stood stark
still and again the bear stopped and
stood up i took the best aim i could
along the rifle-barrel and waited it was
up to the bear it wasnt a big bear and
somehow i didnt seem to get fright-
ened then it started down again and
i moved up it reared and made a spring
forward flailing its forefeet i fired and
fast as i could levered in another shell
it wasnt needed the bear gave a spring
forward and fell face down and never
moved just ten feet away


you never can tell

  when i realized the bear was dead i
became frightened and i trembled all
over i had actual proof of what clint
had said you never can tell what a
wild animal is going to do

  i fired three spaced shots into the air
our signal for help and then sank down
against the tree i heard an answering
shot then their shouts and a few minutes
later my husband and clint broke
through the bushes into the berry-patch
when clint saw the dead bear he stood
there and cursed for a full minute he
turned the bear over and said youve
shot a fat mamma bear therell be cubs
around somewhere well shes fat and
we might as well have some bear-steaks
for a change-and the pelts not bad
he reached up to cut a limb from the
tree with his hand in the air he stood
there then he burst out laughing we
looked up and there in the tree under
which i had been resting were two baby
bears they were fairly well-grown cubs
-big enough clint said to take care of
themselves but that supplied the an-
swer as to why the bear had attacked
out of turn and i cried

  we left the cubs in the tree and next
morning they were gone   

  we made fine time on our way out for
we shot rapids that we had had to por-
tage on the way in on the downward
trip we met one of the tragedies of the
north country an indian woman sig-
naled us from the shore clint jabbered
with her for a few minutes then turned
to us theres been an accident come
with me lady youd better stay here
this may not be nice

  half an hour later my husband re-
turned to the canoe for a shovel he
looked rather white around the mouth
theres a dead indian out there he
told me weve got to bury him
later they reconstructed the story for
me the womans indian husband had
either been attacked by a moose or had
shot and wounded it he had fired twelve
bullets into the animal from his old
smooth-bore forty-four the moose lay
dead but a few feet away lay the indian
trampled to death every bone in his body
broken

  they buried the body where it lay and
the indian wife followed us downstream
in her canoe stolid in her grief again
i remembered clints saying you nev-
er can tell what a wild animal will do
when we parted with clint he said to
me come back in the fall and well get
a moose i had made the inner circle

cjfiood for

bandits of various sorts
give a relief worker
plenty trouble

the notorious twelfth red army of
soviet russia violently invaded the
peaceful republic of georgia in
march  marching bloodily down
from baku on the caspian to batum on
the shore of the black sea where the
georgian nationalists made a last stand

  passenger and commercial traffic on
the countrys single railroad was at a
standstill the red army had com-
mandeered everything on wheels to trans-
port heavy garrisons to newly advanced
boundaries this was almost tragic for
a fellow-american director of the local
near east relief office established to aid
armenians in the hinterland his supply
trains into armenia already many days
delayed by actual warfare now faced
further delay because of military opera-
tions after long wrangling negotia-
tions army authorities agreed to route
through one food train

  the only catch is he told me later
i have no one i can trust to send in
charge of the train i cant leave batum
with the warehouses here full of supplies
the reds would confiscate the minute i
left town

  briefly he explained he would con-
sider it a life-saver if i would volunteer
to convoy a train of food and medical
supplies as far as tiflis where the near
east relief maintained a staff

  thus it was that several days later i
left batum bound for tiflis with a train
of twenty-three cars loaded with mis-
cellaneous supplies each car bore a
large placard identifying it as the proper-
ty of the near east relief and telling
whether it contained condensed milk
sugar flour white beans or medical sup-
plies to guard the train i was given
a detail from the red army consisting
of sixteen chinese mercenaries com-
manded by a jewish corporal who the
previous week had been a sophomore in
the local high-school

  the chinese soldiers were remarkable
more for their zeal than for discretion
when the train halted along the road
they shot without discrimination at every

person in sight not excepting me one
another and even their own corporal
he and i retired to the protection of a
car near the middle of the train and
relied on our warlike chinese soldiers to
keep marauders away

  hard luck overtook us before we had
gone twenty miles one of our cars de-
veloped a hot-box the bearing melted
away and the car had to be shunted onto
a siding and abandoned i noted that
the disabled car contained canned milk
and made a memorandum on my mani-
fests too bad i thought it was not a
bean car or at least a flour car milk
i had been told was badly needed for
children in the orphanages up in armenia

  ten miles on a second car went out
of commission and after a few miles
further a third investigation revealed
they both contained sugar our next most
valuable commodity in point of need in
armenia this time we harangued the
chinese soldiers into stacking their rifles
conscripted several gawking villagers at
the scene and dumped the contents of a
bean-car into a station shed into the
emptied car we transferred sugar from
one disabled car we repeated the proc-
ess with a flour-car and moved the sec-
ond car of sugar

  suspicious by now because only sugar-
and milk-cars were running hot-boxes
the corporal and i investigated we dis-
covered the journal boxes had been
drained and the oil and wicking replaced
with sand search along the train re-
vealed that every sugar- and milk-car
had been tampered with

  after long hours of work we cleared
the boxes and put in new lubricants the
corporal came forward with a suggestion
we shuffled the placards on the cars
from sugar- and milk-cars we ripped
the signs and nailed them to cars loaded
with flour or beans flour or bean labels
were put on milk- and sugar-cars then
we got under way confident that if any
cars were disabled they were likely to
be loaded with flour or beans rather
than the precious milk and sugar

  every few miles we were shunted onto
a siding to give right-of-way to a troop
train or one loaded with military equip-
ment hours elapsed in these waits
nights we laid over on sidings while the
train-crew slept for there was no crew
relief and no change of locomotives
available to us everybody slept that
is everybody but the vigilant chinese
they seemed to be forever sleepless and
always firing off their rifles

  on the third day we came to the foot
of a long steep grade leading up and
over the great divide to michailoff
through the famous tunnel of the same
name the load was too much for our
decrepit locomotive which by this time
was spouting steam from every joint
aid came unexpectedly when a locomo-
tive was dropped off from the rear end
of a double-header after pushing it over
the top to our side of the mountains
meanwhile our train had pulled back
out onto the main line the extra engine
from the other train was cut- off from
return unless it helped us over the slope
we held high cards in the argument
which followed and finally assailed the
grade shoved half-heartedly from the
rear by our unwilling recruit

  halfway up it seemed we could go no
farther i cursed the engineer on the
forward locomotive and we all disem-
barked and threw sand under its wheels

  the engineer insisted he was giving
all he had that dog on the back is
loafing he wailed he gets a bonus
on all the fuel he can save and hes sav-
ing plenty at the rate hes pushing

  ill soon fix that i told him and
dropping off the engine step i waited
until half the train of twenty cars had
passed me boarding the tenth car i
reached in and tripped the coupling
since the air was operating only on the
two locomotives and their tenders no
brakes were set the front engines
labored puffs quickened immediately
the train parted in the middle and the
front portion forged sturdily ahead un-
der the tug of the relieved locomotive

  i waved a derisive highball to the sur-
prised engineer on the rear engine when
he leaned from his cab he shook an
angry fist at me and for a tense moment
i doubted whether my ruse would work

  suddenly the figure of a chinese guard
rifle in hand appeared on the top of the
rear car nearest the locomotive gesticu-
lating frantically toward the departing
front half of the train the soldier ap-
parently held the engineer personally re-
real experiences

sponsible for the break he grimly
brought his rifle to the shoulder and drew
a wavering bead on the engineers pro-
truding head the head was yanked in
like a turtles and i knew i had won
when the rear half began to belch smoke
and steam

it was a short-lived victory toward
evening we pulled into michailoff sta-
tion on the other side of the divide the
young red officer in charge of the station
and yards-the komisar-refused us a
clearance the engineer of the hijacked
engine accused me of crimping his loco-
motive my own guards accused me of
attempting to run away with half the
train the komisar of police arrived
accompanied by a retinue of satellites
and gravely suggested i might be a spy
carrying a trainload of supplies to some
capitalistic enemy

  in short i was taken from the train
and spent the early part of the night in
the stationmasters office answering silly
questions and wondering between ques-
tions whether i would be shot this was
not as remote a chance as it might seem
for these swashbuckling youngsters were
the supreme law several of them wore
the uniforms of the cheka the all-pow-
erful revolutionary police

  knowing russians i was not surprised
that questioning was abruptly suspended
when one man said let us have a drink
and eat a little

  drink what asked another and
turning to me have you any brandy in
that car of medical supplies

  having in mind that the near east
relief is largely supported by contribu-
tions from churches in the bible belt i
told him i thought not nevertheless
the car was broached and its contents
searched no brandy was found among
the rifled goods the komisars com-
ments became uncomfortably caustic and
threatening hoping some local resident
might sell me vodka where they would
fear to deal with the reds i volunteered
to go search for a drink

  mind you dont come back with any
of that damned vinegar they drink
around here i was admonished as i left

  i knocked at several doors along the
darkened streets but householders were
still terrorized by the red invasion and
refused to talk with me i was about to
turn back when i heard strains of music
in the distance i recognized the instru-
ment as a zurna a blaring reed pipe
played exclusively out of doors hope

revived for outdoor music betokened a
wedding or christening either of which
surely meant something to drink

  i hastened through crooked lanes on
the outskirts of the town i intercepted
a small procession on foot following a
creaking bullock-cart in which sat a very
old man it was a wedding party i
could tell from the brides finery revealed
in the flickering light of torches carried
by the celebrants but far more impor-
tant-it was an armenian wedding

  no missionary back home ever painted
such a harrowing picture of starving
armenians as i did in the next few min-
utes in brief i told the wedding party
unless  could get the komisars genially
drunk i should probably be shot and the
food-train would never reach their hun-
gry compatriots in armenia

  here friend it is a small sacrifice
the old man in the cart quavered and
he lifted up a wine-skin from the floor

  no wine i demurred they warned
me not to bring back wine

  this is not wine but good home-made
grape brandy the old man explained
and he added a string of smoked fish to
the gift of brandy

  i grabbed the proffered skin and from
the feel of its greasy folds i estimated
it must contain at least two gallons of
liquor the potency of georgian chacha
is notorious and i foresaw success

  russians have a surprising capacity
for liquor two solid hours of drinking
elapsed before i dared ask for my train

  a clearance for your train  the komi-
sar vacantly repeated my timid request
why to be sure you are a fine fel-
low and can have anything you wish

his sudden agreement was as absurd
and unreasonable as his original re-
fusal but i refrained from comment
with a flourish he signed and stamped
an order and gravely conducted me to
the door through which i fled in search
of the dispatcher

  a case of milk to this man some sugar
to another and in less than half an hour
my train was again under way with a
clear track through to tiflis-which i
reached the following morning

  in time of peace the trip from batum
to tiflis consumed about ten hours it
had taken us more than four days-and

i	still had the return trip to make i
did it on horseback in twelve days

  the food train never reached armenia
it was expropriated by the red army
two hours after i delivered it at tiflis
