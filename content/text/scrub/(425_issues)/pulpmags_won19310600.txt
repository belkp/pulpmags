wonders of the human body

by hugo gernsback

e need not take a trip to an-
other planet to discover some
of the most amazing and
sometime incredible facts-
many of them can be found
right at home indeed we
need but examine our own bodies and
here we can find a tremendous wealth of
knowledge some of which is as incredi-
ble as it is true

 there are many unusual phenomena
connected with the human body that
present-day science has not as yet been
able to explain and for that reason it
has become a most fertile field of ex-
ploitation by all the various fakers such
as astrologists soothsayers health cults
and the rest of the clique who exploit
an ingenuous public

  investigators from time immemorial
have believed for instance that the hu-
man body evolves a sort of effluvium or
aura and the ancients studied this prob-
lem from many angles over a hundred
years ago an investigator by the name
of reichenbach thought he had discovered
a new force by which certain human be-
ings when placed in absolute darkness
could be seen to give off very faint
luminous emanations reichenbach called
this new force od its existence how-
ever has been more or less discredited by
modern investigators

  some years ago however another in-
vestigator took up the same study along
more scientific lines and found that the
human aura could indeed be made visible
in a dark room not however to the
naked eye it was necessary to view
the body through a chemical solution in

a glass container this chemical dye a
coal-tar product is called dicyanin ex-
periments which have been verified many
times have been made whereby the hu-
man aura actually extending from the
human body from one to twelve inches
has been observed and the discoverer of
the process dr walter j kilner ba
mb mrcp of st thomas london
england actually can tell the state of
health of the individual by merely ob-
serving the color and the size of the
aura

  what the aura is no one seems to
know whether it is a heat-emanation an
electrical phenomenon an odoriferous ef-
fluvium or some other unknown force
later investigators probably will discover
more about this

  it is of course a common experience
to most of us that for certain people on
first meeting we acquire a strong at-
tachment or indeed the reverse a strong
antipathy whether the aura has any-
thing to do with this we do not know
some misguided investigators attribute
this phenomena to personal magnetism
but it is of course well known today to
the scientific investigator that there is
nothing magnetic about the human body
the term personal magnetism is there-
fore a misnomer but the phenomena may
have for its basis some other physical
phenomenon which as yet we do not
know

  these are only a few of the mysteries
of the human body many others of a
similar nature will no doubt come to the
mind of the reader and all will be under
more and more close examination in the
ages to come

       a scoop

gain wonder stories scoops the science fiction field in the july
issue we shall print a most interesting as well as technically accurate
interplanetary story by one of the first pioneers of space flying who in fact
is also the first martyr to interplanetary flying since he recently lost his life
in experimenting with his rocket machine the name of the story is
a daring trip to mars by max valier

    this story was written before mr valiers death and is now to be pub-
lished for the first time in america in wonder stories

  habit of spreading the
  worst things that each pos-

  the best things thus our
  first communication with
  india and china was based
  on the very lucrative trade
  in opium which preceded
  by far an exhange of art
  and philosophy

     the civilizing of the
   american indian meant
   feeding him with whiskey
   in order to steal his lands
   and our contact with the
   black races was followed
   quickly by their enslave-
   ment

     the greeds of man seem
   to precede his civilizing
   powers and it is unfor-
   tunately possible that such
   will be the case if intelli-
   gent beings exist on other
   planets and communication
   is established with them

     the present story is a
   thrilling one not only be-
   cause it is so packed with
   action but because it paints
   so vividly the interactions
   of the peoples of three

commander of the

was in earnest conversa-
tion with the doctor as
vic and dick and brad
entered his office doc-
tor kunzie led them into
the next room and cap-
tain south followed grun
maliu was conscious his
pupils still unnaturally
contracted he had not
seen them enter but
sensed their presence he
spoke each word a conscious effort

  the doctor tells me that im done-that
ill go into the final stupor before long-
you see i was-what you call-double-
crossed the red dust of mars venn-
hellish stuff but theres money in it-i was
going to try to grow some on venus-the
venn-plant i mean-you can grow anything
in the hot lands but if im going to blank
out-i have something almost like a con-
science-i should be stamped out im not
afraid to die-not trying to make my peace
-not a coward-not afraid to die-but-
his voice died away but in a minute he
seemed to rouse himself grun mahu was
an aristocrat of venus

  theres a ring-on this flyer-smug-
glers theyll stop at nothing-murder-
piracy-you see theres money in it i was
one of them but-i started to think what
a cad i was-wreck other peoples lives-
and-they double-crossed me wait-ill
tell you-tja narro martian devil is one
of them- and harburton smithers and the
leader is-

  it was seven minutes before he roused
himself again for the last time not--
afraid to die-the leader is-is-

  silence

  i am absolutely certain said captain
south that every passenger all luggage
and every bit of cargo was carefully exam-
ined with xx-rays before
we left the earth no trace
of venn being found
then captain you
must be mistaken said
the solemn brad culbert-
son

  the inspectors at new
york are conscientious
and incorruptible the
council of planets is
more determined than
ever to stamp out this
murderous drug traffic
yet it is obvious that that
waiter obtained the drug
omewhere on board this
vessel there is one pos-
sibility but-

  what is it

  an orderly entered well said the
captain

  sir one of the waiters has just been
found dead someone shot him

  ill attend to the matter at once said
doctor kunzie and hurried out captain
south swore softly

  quick work said vic vincennes dryly
you were saying sir continued the
imperturbable brad that there was one
possibility

the imperial martian party the
planetchiefs person and baggage and those
of his daughter were not examined cour-
tesy to rulers but its absurd to think-
their bodyguard and servants

charles cloukey
in the spacesphere



  all carefully examined and totally in-
nocent

  well we should take xx-ray photos of
the baggage of the planetchief and the girl
not their hand baggage it would be in-
sulting to them and embarrassing to us to
explain why we wanted to search at this late
hour but someone may have tampered with
their larger baggage after it was packed
knowing that it alone would not be sub-
jected to the xx-ray search if thats the
case whoever did it is clever and nervy if
the planetchief caught him--

  there would be one less dope smuggler
ir the universe said vic a hard man
the planetchief any smuggler would rather
face the earth-laws than the justice of mars
zon scama commands respect

  undoubtedly you have an xx-ray ap-
paratus aboard asked brad culbertson

the captain hesitated these three
young men were passengers but they
and particularly culbertson seemed to
know just what they were doing he made
a decision

  its in a cabinet in cargo-room a but
its dangerous for an unskilled operator the
high tension of the juice it uses and the
character of the rays-

  i can handle it said brad

  doctor kunzie returned the waiter
will never tell us anything now someone
got him from the rear through the heart
with a silenced slug-gun

  another orderly entered and spoke to
captain south an unidentified spacecraft
bearing no insignia whatever has been sight-
ed between us and venus sir it will inter-
cept our course at our present rate of speed
within an hour the second officer asked me
to tell you sir that the strange flyer con-
sistently refuses to reply to visual or cos-
mic-radio signals

  captain south went to the navigation
room after writing a pass for culbertson
and the others they descended to the
cargo-room and set to work

  the strange stellar craft was drawing
near a mere fifty thousand miles or so

separated it from the cosmonia and cap-
tain south was watching it through the hy-
pertelescope with anxiety the course of
the stranger and that of the cosmonia would
intersect unless one of them were changed
the other semed to have come from the
growing disk that was venus but it showed
no planetary insignia whatever it would
meet the cosmonia in fifteen minutes more

  it was a new and racy-looking craft with
the streamlined teardrop shape to make
possible better speed within a planets at-
mosphere the cosmonia was perfectly
spherical as were most spaceships the
captain could see on the image in the
telescope weapon locks forbidden by the
council of planets the stranger was arm-
ed the cosmonia was defenceless piracy
it would take at least three hours and
probably longer for help to arrive from
venus

  captain south slowed and stopped he
doubled his speed five seconds later the
stranger did the same he was thirty-four
thousand miles away when the cosmonia s
radioman received the first message from
him

  slow and stop within five minutes or i
shall wreck you i am fully armed

  captain south slowed and stopped he
had a thousand human lives to be responsi-
ble for and the stranger seemed both able
and willing to carry out his threat

  what do you want asked the cos-
monias radioman

  the planetchief of mars is aboard you
is he not

  he is

  he and all his party and baggage must
be delivered to me at once	-

  who are you

  that is not important notify the plan-
etchief of my demand

  captain south did so the alien craft was
maneuvering close alongside wearing a
spacesuit for protection with the cooper-
ation of the navigators of both ships an
individual could be easily transferred from
one ship to another through the air-locks

chapter ii

an abduction

the news was all over the cosmonia
and the passengers were requested to
keep to their cabins brad and dick and
vic hearing about it in the cargo-room
made a few last hurried exposures of the
martian partys heavy baggage vic took
the films to the ships chemlab brad and
dick went to the navigation room where
they had no real right to be

  the stern hard-faced zon scarna planet-
chief of mars soon arrived on the bridge
with his daughter and their bodyguard kee
scarna was schooled not to show her emo-
tions but she paled a little at the sight of
dick dubrocq zon scarna ignored brad
and dick and spoke to the captain no
slightest sign of emotion was observable
in the martian rulers calm exterior but
there might have been the merest trace of
bitterness in his voice

  captain south he said slowly poli-
tics on mars often become very bitter i
am hated by thousands just what or who
is behind this attack i cannot tell you but
if it is they whom i suspect they would not
hesitate one second about annihilating the
cosmonia merely to kill me therefore i
shall submit as it is not just that i imperil
thousands of earthmen and venusians by
refusing the martians on this vessel i be-
lieved would be willing to attempt a fight
or a flight in my behalf but they are com-
parably few and you and the others owe
me no allegiance whatever you are re-
sponsible for the lives in your charge i
ask only that you keep track of this vessel
a long as possible with your instruments
and that at the earliest opportunity you
send all available interplanetary patrol
flyers after it

  i shall do so

  please have spacesuits brought and pre-
pare to transfer my baggage notify my
captors that i shall shortly come aboard
the captain nodded to the radioman who
bent over his instruments you two men
he said calmly as if speaking to members of
the crew will supervise the transfer of the

planetchiefs luggage have it brought to
the main air-lock at once

  dick was dazed trembling looking at
kee scarna who had turned away her head
but brad caught the cue he saluted smart-
ly and turned on his heel nudging du-
brocq yes sir at once sir said brad-
ley culbertson

  when they reached the cargo-room orders
from the captain giving them command of
the baggage removal were recorded on the
order tape the crew cooperated five
trunks and three sealed crates bearing the
imperial martian insignia were hoisted to
the lock-deck placed on rollers and rolled
to the main air-lock strong cables were
attached to each

  the martian servants and guards were
donning the spacesuits they would need for
protection against the cold while passing
from one ship to the other spaceships did
not dare approach nearer than twenty-five
to fifty feet and cables were attached to
anyone or anything being transferred from
one to another in order to prevent loss in
mid-space when the person or object was
safe in the airlock of the other craft the
cable could be severed or detached by men
waiting there and drawn back to the first
ship brad and dick knew what captain
south had intended they donned two of
the spacesuits hanging on the wall and
joined the party in the confusion they
were unnoticed and after they were in the
suits they were unrecognizable

kee scarna noticed them she trem-
bled as her personal maids assisted her
into her spacesuit the planetchief was the
fii st to be transferred across he went
through the airlock and out into space at-
tached by a cable to the cosmonia jumping
away from it and sailing toward the other
air-lock of which the outer door was open
to receive him from the cosmonia a man
in a spacesuit could be seen in that lock
ready with an atomic hydrogen torch to
sever th cable of the planetchief who had
inanaged the crossing nicely when the
cable was cut the other door of the lock
closed reopening after a few moments the
man with the torch was still waiting but
in the spacesphere



zon scarna had disappeared into the inter-
ior

  kee scarna was transferred and then the
trunks and craves finally came the servants
and guards including brad and dick who
went last when they had been passed
through the lock the tear-shaped ship took
its departure flying almost tangentially to
venus apparently neither approaching nor
receding from the planet

  in the meantime vic vincennes had the
developed xx-ray films destroyed as soon
as prints had been made and took the prints
to captain south

  the three crates and four of the trunks
of the martian party were totally innocent
but the other trunk the shadow-pictures
showed was one-fifth full of pure refined
venn in powder form the other four-
fifths was packed with venn-plants grun
mahu had intended to try to grow venn on
venus this fifth trunk now was in the
possession of the abductors of the martian
party

  dick and brad were the last to remove
their spacesuits in the alien craft a venus-
ian armed with a wicked-looking slug-gun
regarded them suspiciously as all the others
in the party had been martians finally
this unpleasant individual asked pointedly
what connection they had with the martian
group the two reacted characteristically
culbertson started to answer smoothly that
they were interpreters of the various earth-
languages but he never finished for the
herculean dubrocq had knocked the slug-
gun out of the guards hand with one beau-
tifully accurate instantaneous movement

  brad got the gun almost before it touched
the floor while dick took a blow on the
jaw that dazed even him in two seconds
more brad had control of the situation and
dicks mind had cleared the venusians
massive hands were above his head and his
eyes were intent on the gun in brads hand

  the three of them were alone in the cham-
ber just inside the air-lock the members
of the martian party had been taken to
some other part of the flyer as fast as
they had arrived to prevent crowding in the
smaller chamber the one remaining guard
was supposed to bring the last two

  the lock-door opened and another man

in a spacesuit entered-the individual who
had stayed in the lock and had severed the
cables dick jumped toward him before
he understood the situation wrenched the
heavy atomic hydrogen torch from him
with all his tremendous strength the giant
earthman brought the heavy torch down
ir a crashing blow on the others head it
had not the slightest apparent effect ex-
cellent physical protection spacesuits

  now the guard made a leap for brad
trying to imitate the blow by which dick
had deprived him of the gun but dubrocq
alert and glorying in physical action flung
the heavy piece of apparatus at the guards
head the guard went down in a heap
dubrocq recovered his ponderous weapon
an ordinary man could hardly have lifted
it

in command

brad motioned for the other to take off
his spacesuit the fellow complied and
they saw that he was a little martian with
a hideously deformed body and yet agile
and strong dick ripped off the mans grav-
ity harness the gravity in the flyer was
being kept about equal to that of the earth
or venus without a gravity-harness to neu-
tralize most of the pull a martian was hard-
ly able to move all of the planetchiefs
party were wearing gravity-harnesses

  the deformed martian seeing that resist-
ance was useless lay flat upon the floor to
minimize the to him dangerous pull upon
his body he could not move except with
considerable pain and the expenditure of
much energy the venusian was uncon-
scious or dead for a moment the two in-
vaders were unopposed

  they opened a door leading into a long
corridor and cautiously proceeded down it
brad still had the gun and dick the heavy
torch

  there seemed to be no one in the cor-
ridor and no trace of any of the martian
party theyve probably already been con-
fined in staterooms suggested brad in a
whisper hes being treated well serv-

ants and baggage all arranged for whats
the purpose of the abduction ransom

  shut up whispered dick

   hey passed closed numbered doors
then one that was marked elevator one
storerooms and one further along that
bore the legend navigation room brad
hesitated dick boldly threw open the door
and walked in

  there was a long-headed grim-faced mar-
tian at the control-panel desk he looked
up to gaze down the big bore of the sluggun
and slowly lifted his long-fingered hands

  brad was puzzled the men they had en-
countered so far were from two different
planets which planet was behind the af-
fair what was the motive

  what do you want asked the man at
the control-panel desk paling visibly he
seemed to be totally unnerved trembling in
hif chair

  cooperation stated brad harshly
or- he glanced for a second at the ugly
weapon in his hand the other said noth-
ing

  you will start the flyer back in the gen-
eral direction of the cosmonia  said dick
dubrocq and meanwhile you will start at
once to calculate the course that will enable
you to meet the cosmonia in the shortest
possible time

  the martian opened some switches and
threw some others adjusting rheostats care-
fully he examined the images of the cos-
monia that were upon several ground-glass
screens the telescopes which supplied the
images were on opposite sides of the flyer
and gave the distance of the cosmonia by
electric triangulation the navigator was
busily feeding figures into one end of a cal-
culating machine and was watching the in-
dicators on the other end of the device from
time to time he made a change on the great
electrical panel before him

  suddenly he tore off his earphones and
handed them to dick who donned them and
understood someone in command was
cursing the navigator heartily demanding
what was wrong with him and commanding
immediate rectification of the course the
navigator had not dared make a reply in
the face of the gun dubrocq made no re-

ply either but went to the door and stood
at one side of it knowing that very soon
someone would arrive to investigate con-
ditions

  in a moment the door opened and a figure
stepped through dick hit him with the
atomic torch and stood staring at the man
recumbent on the floor he had knocked
out the planetchief of mars

  kee scarna came through the door with
a startled gasp recognizing the wielder of
the torch terror came to her eyes

  dick what is it zat you have done

  dubrocq was too startled to act she had
called him involuntarily by his given name

  the third to come through the door had
a tiny poison-dart gun in the palm of his
hand he had apparently been urging the
planetchief and his daughter ahead of him
covering them with the weapon he pointed
it at the still-dazed dick who dropped the
heavy atomic torch and raised his hands
he saw the little martian princess watch-
ing him with wide eyes she was trying not
to sob

in a very few seconds the venusian had
produced a second dart-gun from a con-
venient pocket and was covering brad

  throw the slug-gun on the floor com-
manded the venusian

  brad tossed it away one second too late
the venusian realized that brad had tossed
it with the neatest of precision to the up-
stretched right hand of dick dubrocq who
caught it and fired at the venusian too
hastily the slug missed its mark and im-
bedded itself in the opposite wall

  the venusian fired his dart-guns simul-
taneously the dart intended for culbert-
son missed but struck the navigator who
slumped forward in his seat the dart in-
tended for dubrocq was well-aimed but the
planetchiefs daughter interposed herself be-
tween dick and the venusian she fell for-
ward as the dart entered her shoulder dicks
second shot put an end to the venusian he
fell with a gasp

  the planetchief of mars came to and sat
up he took in the whole situation but
there was no trace of emotion in his voice
the navigator and the captain here he
in the spacesphere



stated are the only two on this underman-
ned vessel who possessed enough knowledge
to navigate a space-ship and they are both
dead can either of you men navigate in
space

   no said bradley culbertson

         chapter iii
         trouble ahead

ick dubrocq was very calm he
seized the martian rulers shoulder and
wheeled him around your daughter he
said will die in a very few minutes unless
she is cared for find me some first-aid
materials immediately

   dick bent over the girl ripped open her
 dress and with string fingers removed the
 tiny dart from her shoulder there was an
 ugly blue circle two inches in diameter
 around the tiny cut the dart had made

 what is it brad

   the planetchief had already left the room
 for the first time in his life someone had
 given him an order he seemed to know
 something of the vessel for he returned
 shortly with a large first-aid kit from the
 doctors office but there was no doctor
 aboard that furtiveunlicensed spaceship

   it looks like venusian sanzan said
brad theres only one hope cut and
burn it out

   god give me nerve said dick dubrocq
 he motioned toward the heavy undamaged
 atomic torch brad extracted a cigarette
  lighter from his pocket and lit the torch
 the gauge showed that its limited supply of
 hydrogen was almost exhausted dick se-
 lected a keen blade from the kit that the
 j planetchief had opened the martians
 hands were trembling now he did have
 love and fear behind that stern exterior
 and as he watched dubrocq he had hope
 too

   for the merest fraction of a second dick
 held the blade in the hydrogen flame the
 steel would have melted away in almost no
 time at all the ugly circle of blue stand-
 ing out vividly against the white flesh of
 the shoulder had increased an inch in
 diameter before their eyes dick slashed

the blue flesh with the red-hot scalpel
criss-crossing it with cuts thick foul
bluish blood oozed out brad wiped it up
with sanitary cellulose the kneeling giant
heated the thin blade again and again and
cut the merest trifle deeper each time un-
til clean red blood was all that flowed out
the blue circle when wiped clean of blood
for a second was paler it did not increase
in diameter they staunched the bleeding
with compresses and were silent watching
the hydrogen torch went out

  they watched the faint blue circle for ten
minutes it did not increase or grow dark-
er it became paler as they watched the
girls breathing became regular a chok-
ing cry of relief came from the planetchiefs
throat and then he was again the cold and
impersonal ruler

  the navigator was beyond relief his
whole body now was almost unrecogniz-
able with that horrible bluish color

  dick dubrocq collapsed in a heap on the
floor

  a jar shook the spaceflyer it had col-
lided with a large meteor there was a
tiny faint hiss air was leaking out some-
where brad lifted dick to a seat in a
moment he was himself again thanks
old fellow a nervous reaction thats all
its the first time ive ever played the sur-
geon with a girl i love

  the hint of a smile played across brads
solemn features the planetchiefs coun-
tenance did not alter in the least dick had
forgotten his presence he came forward

  the leaking air may become danger-
ous i suggest you get the cosmonia as soon
as you can by radio

  yes sir said bradley culbertson

the navigator had done his work well
the cosmonia was a mere fifteen thou-
sand miles away and careful radio instruc-
tions enabled the adept brad to maneuver
alongside the immense spherical flyer and
everyone on the tear-shaped ship was trans-
ferred back to safety a navigator equipped
with a helmet and a liberal supply of oxy-
gen was sent aboard the alien ship to bring
it into venus safely kee scarna was given
excellent care by doctor kunzie zon


wonder stories

scarna was as impersonal and as apparent-
ly unconcerned by events as usual

  after talking with captain south brad
consulted the martian rulers secretary
about the partys baggage the secretary
consulted a card-index

  aside from the cases and trunks in the
staterooms of the various members of the
party said the secretary there are three
crates and four trunks in the cargo-room
the imperial planetchief has no use for their
contents until he reaches mars

  thanks said bradley culbertson hel-
lo vic wheres dick

  kee scarna asked to be permitted to see
him her father could hardly refuse
dicks preparing a heart-break for himself
brad hes learning to care for the kid
but shes a princess its impossible it may
make trouble-

  well weve located the source of the
venn one of the trunks bearing the planet-
chiefs insignia doesnt belong to the party
some clever smuggler got the extra one in
without inspection if the planetchief finds
out- if that secretary ever decides to check
up and finds an extra trunk with the im-
perial insignia actually counterfeited -
theres trouble ahead 

  poor fellow said vic dryly in love
with a princess yes theres trouble ahead
three hours later the cosmonia had pass-
ed through the layer of thick clouds and
was slowly descending in the yellowish at-
mosphere toward one of the landing cradles
of city fourteen of the third nation of
venus

  the venusian metropolis lay spread out
below with its methodical arrangement of
cubic skyscrapers in spite of the ever-
present clouds the sunlight had an intensity
that it never had on earth the great
sphere eased slowly down vic and dick
and the solemn brad were on the air-lock
deck where hundreds of passengers were
gathered for disembarking

  as the cosmonia landed gently a bullet
grazed dubrocqs side it had been intend-
ed for his heart the airlocks had been
thrown wide open and hundreds were
crowding to get out into the rich damp air
of the hot planet someone in that crowd

using some sort of silent bullet-projector
had failed in an attempt at cold-blooded
murder

  the quick-eyed vic had caught sight of a
slight figure slinking between a couple of
obese venusian women to get out of sight
and had recognized the martian named tja
narro vic spoke to dick who penetrated
into the crowd and managed to approach
tja narro wrho did not make any unusual
motion or vain attempt to break away
through the crowd in fact tja narro
didnt appear to notice the approach of the
young giant earthman at all until dick
touched his shoulder

the whip hand

the crowd more orderly now filing out
quickly to be met by venusian cus-
toms officers paid no attention to dick
and the martian vic and brad watched
alertly

  dubrocq calmly requested the little mar-
tian to come to the navigation room for a
conference with captain south tja narro
expressed annoyance but agreed to come
bradley culbertson joined dick and they
took the martian to the navigation room
captain south looked up in surprise from
a celestial chart as they entered and mo-
tioned them to three comfortable chairs
that were near

  this gentleman is-tja narro per-
haps

  i am admitted the martian these
men brought me here ostensibly for a con-
ference with you it is obvious that you
were not expecting any conference cap-
tain so i shall not take up any more of
your time he rose and started to leave

  just a moment mr narro said dick
please resume your seat

  the martian hesitated stared into du-
brocqs eyes and finally reseated himself

  contrary to your supposition said cap-
tain south i have been quite desirous of
speaking with you but the work of celestial
navigation has kept me busy  now that
we have landed i feel that it is my duty to
inform you that a very serious accusation
has been made against you

  indeed of course i may ask what it

is

  of course you are accused of connec-
tion with a band of interplanetary dope-
smugglers aboard this vessel the same band
i believe that managed to get three tons or
more of martian venn into new york dur-
ing the last year this of course is the
showdown unless you can clear yourself
i shall not permit you to land on venus i
am curious to know why you attempt such
a thing after purchasing accommodations
all the way to mars

  you seem to keep well informed about
your thousands of passengers captain or
have you made a special study of me
you are to answer questions not ask
them said captain south

  i shall answer only such questions as i
please to answer snapped the martian
since you are so eager for a showdown
well have it out now to relieve your anx-
iety i shall state that i am a member of
the smuggling ring under consideration
that i regret failing to kill this dubrocq as
i had orders to do so frankly he is a
nuisance eventually i shall kill him
dont move captain and please dont act
so astonished in about three minutes you
will understand that i hold the steel whip
above all of you to borrow a charming
venusian expression this is what you
vulgarly call a showdown but i am the
one who shall do the talking

  meanwhile an old and wrinkled martian
had approached vincennes on the airlock
deck speaking in halting english

  are you ze man name deeck deeck
du- du- i do not know how to say-
richard dubrocq no hes not here
now

  no there was a faint note of alarm
in the old mans voice you are name
veec veec vinzenne

  i am victor vincennes

  ah weel you come weet me at once
eet ees very eemportant

  vic went with the martian

	  

  i have a number of things to tell you
said tja narro to the three in the navigation
room

  first i have a weapon in my pocket
easily available second i was entirely
within my rights when i attempted to leave
the cosmonia here every ticket sold for
this ship to mars allows the privilege of
discontinuing the voyage at venus from
here i understand the cosmonia will go
directly to the red planet but i have re-
ceived orders from my employer who has
asked me to remain on venus and perform
some little services for him there mr
smithers and i have both decided to cut
short our trips

the captain started at the name of har-
burton smithers wealthy earthman
and reached involuntarily for a speaking
tube but he found tja narro pointing a
mean little bullet projector at him

  i regret that this diminutive weapon con-
tains only one bullet at a time but that
one is poisoned and the first of you three
who moves will die while the other two will
gain nothing at all even should you cap-
ture or kill me let the speaking tube
alone captain we shall probably be in-
terrupted sooner or later by some unfortun-
ate individual but why sign a mans death-
warrant by asking him to come here now

  at present i desire strongly to explain
t you some of the latest martian advances
in the interesting science of physical chem-
istry my talk i dare say will be quite
instructive please listen quietly and do
not delude yourselves into thinking that i
shall not be alert every second for the
slightest suspicious move by any of you
now about this scientific discovery

  on mars for the last thousand years
or so the best scientists have been inclined
to uphold a theory of the atom somewhat
resembling the theory presented on earth a
mere century ago by the scientist bohr and
others the so-called planetary atom you
know i suppose-a compound central nuc-
leus of protons and electrons with more
prctons than electrons hence positively
charged balancing this charge are one
or more planetary electrons revolving
around the nucleus of course my de-
scription is inaccurate and faulty but i
dont want to spend too much time-


wonder stories

  the chemical properties such as val-
ence depend on the number of electrons in
the outer orbit of the atom a neon atom
for instance has a full set of eight electrons
in its outer ring or shell and is complete
and stable it will not combine with any-
thing not even another neon atom it is
inert and-

  tja narros manner indicated that he was
likely to continue for several hours brad
interrupted him

  what are you driving at your forced
lecture is not particularly new im listen-
ing mainly because of the gun but i con-
fess a curiosity to know why you are dis-
coursing upon the neon atom at the present
time perhaps you are just killing time
tja narro laughed unpleasantly per-
haps i find it more interesting to talk
than to sit here in silence moreover i
am leading up to something quite startling-
ly definite to continue

  recently a clever scientist of the red
planet devised a way to make two neon
atoms combine by sharing all their electrons
understand bineon is not a biatomic mole-
cule it is rather a totally new artificial
atom whose properties in no way resemble
those of a neon atom instead its chemical
and physical properties show a resemblance
to those of calcium the mono-nuclear ele-
ment that has twenty planetary electrons

  an ordinary neon atom has ten two
in the primary orbit and eight in the outer
orbit it is a gas bi-neon is a decidedly
metallic solid chemically active with a
valence of two the valence of calcium you
can see that a great scientific advance has
been made

chapter iv
a case of invisibility

     read the scientific journals of mars
i earth and venus said brad but
i dont remember having heard about this
achievement it sounds incredible without
proof id have to know more about the
scientists methods before i could believe
his claims when and where was this dis-
covery made public

  most unfortunately this scientist met
with an accident before his discoveries were
made public

  indeed

  indeed you see the carbonate of bi-
neon while it resembles in a general way
the carbonate of calcium has very import-
ant special properties one of which is its
extremely great index of refraction in the
pure state bi-neon carbonate is colorless
and transparent as is calcite a pure form
of calcium carbonate you follow me
yes said dick grimly go ahead
bi-neon carbonate can be prepared as a
hard amorphous substance resembling glass
and the scientist found that a ray of light
that once entered a sphere of it could never
emerge due to the extreme index of refrac-
tion the scientist experimented further
with mixtures of the bineon carbonate and
a pure glass by varying the percentages
he could vary the index of the finished pro-
duct

  i see you coming muttered brad
ou probably do the savant finally
made a hollow sphere of a bineon-glass mix-
ture that would let a light ray emerge at a
point exactly opposite the point at which
it entered but without crossing the central
space the refractive index was such that
the light ray was reflected and re-reflected
within the glass around  before it emerg-
ed then of course the sphere and any-
thing in the hollow space within it was to-
tally and completely invisible you know
that a prism can act as a mirror even
though its not silvered in the same way
the hollow sphere acts as thousands of per-
fect mirrors no matter from what angle
you look you see nothing except precisely
what youd see if the sphere and its con-
tents werent there

  a practical method of producing invis-
ibility said brad slowly

  not practical a sphere large enough
to hold a man is rather unwieldy a cylin-
der is more convenient though not so tech-
nically perfect you can see a cylinder from
the top though it is invisible if you look at
the cylindrical surface

  a cylinder seven feet tall mounted on
casters with small holes for the man inside
in the spacesphere



to look through-as no light reaches him
he cant see unless a small eyehole is pro-
vided-will render a man totally invisible
also there should be carefully machined
openings and doors in the cylinder to en-
able the occupant to fire a weapon or to
take objects inside though by doing so he
renders himself visible until the opening is
closed

  a very convenient machine for crimin-
als said captain south

  tja narro laughed again unpleasantly

  you might have the courtesy to watch
your language but after all why not i
am what you call a criminal so are the
others in the-organization we possess
one of those man-concealing cylinders af-
ter the accident that had occurred to the
scientist his inventions were all taken over
and kept secret by the imperial government
of mars they overlooked one cylinder
however for the simple reason that it was
invisible i need not go into details but
that cylinder after many adventures is now
on board this space-flyer

the martian regarded a diminutive
timepiece mr smithers has by this
time removed from the cargo-room the venn
and venn-plants that you discovered with
your prying xx-rays the drug is now safe
on venus my partners invisibility en-
abled him to get rid of the unsuspecting
guard in the cargo-room before that indi-
vidual knew anything was happening

  then in two or three trips he safely
transported all the contents of that myster-
ious extra trunk outside to a fast waiting
truck another trip and he carried away
the empty collapsible trunk in sections just
to remove all annoying evidence of our
work by simple dash-dot code on my mar-
tian pocket radio transmitter i have just
asked him to come here as soon as he fin-
ishes i expect him any minute you will
see the door open but you will not see any-
one enter

  would you mind stating just what your
purpose is asked captain south

  not at all said tja narro coldly
you dont suppose i intend to let you live
after what i told you you three have

been marked for death anyhow as i have
only one bullet i need assistance my in-
visible partner will be well armed you
probably know that the average martian
has no compunction about killing its com-
mon on the red planet in spite of the com-
plicated system of decadent laws

  we are a cynical race not burdened with
any flattering though false ideas of the sanc-
tity of fjman life an interesting scientific
phenomenon life but not of any great value
frankly we are going to kill the three of
you and escape we cant expect you to like
it but we were peaceably minding our own
business until you started to nose in with
investigations dont move my impulsive
friend you are a powerful brute but i
car shoot you quite easily before you reach
me

  the door of the room swung open but
apparently nothing else happened the
three earthmen were rigid in their chairs
tja narro laughed for the third time

  a hand and arm suddenly appeared in
mid-air a heavy automatic slug-gun was
clasped in the hand

  but it was pointed at tja narro

  the martian stared a moment and with a
lightning movement raised his own diminu-
tive projector there was the thud of a
partially muffled shot and the martian fell
forward onto the floor from mid-air came
an ironic voice

  had to do it couldnt give him a chance
with that poison bullet an interesting
phenomenon life but not of any great value
unless one possesses something remotely like
character

  vincennes

  right now brad if youll close the
door well wait for the charming mr smith-
ers unfortunately he did manage to get
the dope off the ship

  the disembodied voice ceased brad push-
ed the door shut but in a moment it opened
again

  vics arm and hand and slug-gun reap-
peared and the muffled thuds of three shots
were heard then in the doorway appeared
the figure of a falling earthman surrounded
by a heap of shattered glittering fragments


wonder stories

of thick curved bineon-glass a slug had
penetrated his heart

  vic suddenly appeared as he opened a
narrow door in the seven foot high glass
cylinder that enclosed him and with him
was the little old martian

  the shootings all over he said you
can thank kee scarna for your lives the
little princess had a pocket code-radio too
and being the planetchiefs daughter of
course she would know the martian dash-
dot code she heard these two gentlemen
plotting and sent this faithful servant of
hers to bring me to the only other invisible
cylinder on board one of those that the
planetchief confiscated

  i was outside listening to your conver-
sation several minutes before i decided
what to do the planetchief doesnt know
that kee betrayed the imperial secret of the
cylinder ill have this man put it back
where zon scarna was keeping it before
he learns anything about whats happened
he would probably scold her if he knew
what shes done

  she saved us said dick slowly

  she would of course dick its rather
obvious that she loves you

operative m

eight hours later the cosmonia was ap-
proaching the earths orbit on a direct
journey from venus to mars which two
planets were just past their conjunction
while the earth was approaching the oppo-
site point in its orbit the cosmonia was
making about one thousand miles a sec-
ond

  one of the ships orderlies entered the
suite that the three shared dick read the
message he brought

  its from captain south he says that
an operative m of the terrestrial secret
service came aboard when we stopped at
venus hes after the dope-ring and wants
ti hear what we know the appointments
at ten-thirty its now just eight twenty-
five

  righto said brad culbertson solemn-

ly-

  later in the evening the three went to the

private parlor where according to the note
m was waiting for them there was no
one in the room but a very blonde and very
attractive earthgirl

  but on second thought the three decided
that she was a woman not a girl no one
of them would have cared to hazard even
an appropriate guess as to her real age
there was an air of capability about her
expression and her bearing and an unob-
trusive air of breeding and dignity that
was not at all incongruous with her very
obvious physical attractiveness she was
the first to speak

  mr culbertson mr vincennes and mr
dubrocq i presume

  indeed yes said dick you must par-
don our surprise captain souths message
led us to think of you as a man you are
operative m

  you should speak more cautiously in
this particular case its all right the cap-
tain has had this parlor electrically isolat-
ed and just to make sure ive spent my
time in a fruitless search for mikes or pho-
tovision eyes if youll be so kind as to
close the door completely the room will be
soundproof and we can proceed with the
business at hand

  brad closed the door by the way would
you mind showing me your credentials
just a precaution you know as weve
never seen you before theres a possibil-
ity that youre an impostor

  quite so captain south will vouch for
me however my credentials happen to be
in the ships main safe at the moment if
you will wait here i shall obtain them
let me offer my services said dick
i am well known to the captain and i
should be glad to save you the errand
no there is also the possibility that
you three might be impostors it was ex-
tremely careless of me not to arrange for
a positive identification without so much
trouble i appreciate your courtesy but i
must obtain the credentials myself please
wait here and say nothing unless the door
is closed

  the woman left  dick closed the door
after her

  what do you make of it fellows
in the spacesphere



  shes the real thing drawled vic

  the giant dubrocq hesitated i dont
know brad somehow she impresses me
as genuine enough if she can present gen-
uine papers-

  he left the sentence unfinished and the
three sat in silence each occupied with his
own thoughts brad was speculating about
the unusual properties of the carbonate of
the synthetic twin-nuclear element bineon
dick dubrocq was dreaming about a slender
grey-eyed martian princess peculiarly
enough one victor vincennes was thinking
of the same martian princess ten minutes
passed and then ten minutes more

  well brad

  shes about four times too slow lets
go to captain souths office i think hes
on duty now and thats where the safe is

  dick opened the door and the three step-
ped out

on the floor just outside was the body
of the woman a bullet had passed com-
pletely through her neck from the front
brad stood for a moment as if dazed then
looked up and down the corridor it was
deserted and there was no sound dick
and vic knelt beside the sprawled-out body
the face was beautiful even after violent
death the throat-wound had not bled pro-
fusely but it had evidently been instantly
fatal the bullet had completely severed
the spinal cord by shattering three of the
cervical vertebrae it lay on the floor not
far away it was made completely of steel
and its force had been almost spent when
it emerged

  dick went for doctor kunzie while vic
stayed by the body brad went in search of
captain south whom he found in the navi-
gation room the captain was horrified he
called the second officer to navigate and
came quickly dick had returned with doc-
tor kunzie and two white-faced orderlies
bearing a stretcher

  for a moment captain south looked down
upon the woman then he turned to brad
this is not operative m he said slow-
ly m is a man he finally decided to
get some sleep and see you tomorrow as
we say in spite of the fact that theres no

day or night out here i do not know who
this woman is

  brad seemed utterly absorbed as the doc-
tor led the orderlies away with their bur-
den and the others knew that his keen mind
was at work brad questioned the cap-
tain

  you sent of course a second message
stating that the interview was postponed
of course didnt you-

  no we didnt get it which orderly did
you send

  the same fellow that brought you the
first one name is joe-er-joe something
number 

  well speak to joe  later captain
would you mind sending for the real
m

  not at all said the captain leaving
hurriedly a moment later doctor kunzie
returned obviously seeking the commander

  whats the difficulty doctor asked
dick

  no trouble but i thought captain
south should know that there were about
three hundred grains of martian venn con-
cealed on the womans person pure drug
too not the usual adulterated stuff

  in what form was it doctor
  powdered in ten grain papers

  thank you ill tell captain south
ill be much obliged good night fel-
lows

   as the doctor left brad picked up the all-
steel bullet examined it minutely and put
it in his pocket after wiping it clean with a
handkerchief captain south returned with
a small thin and altogether negative-look-
ing gentleman whom he introduced as oper-
ative m the small man produced his
credentials all in order he listened min-
utely to all that dick vic brad and the
captain told him but his rather blank ex-
pression did not change he betrayed a
slight interest when told of the strange bul-
let took it and carefully inserted it in a
small leather case he carried he betrayed
no apparent interest at all when told of the
venn he thanked the three for the infor-
mation and took his leave yawning cap-
tain south returned to the navigation room
the three made their way to their suite


wonder stories

    queer-looking little egg m isnt he
  brad

dont misjudge him dick few under-
cover men look the part dont make the
 superstitious mistake of thinking that men
with chins like his are cowards well lets
get some sleep

chapter v
the planetchief speaks

  wien dick dubrocq rose he could not
  find brad culbertson anywhere on the
  flyer a vague misgiving annoyed him he
  roused the sardonic vincennes and talked
  things over vic characteristically put his
  finger on the vital point of the mystery

    ysee dick the main question is this
  why was she killed her identity is im-
  portant too she had no credentials to pre-
  sent and captain south had never seen her
  her motive in trying to interview us is mys-
  terious judging from the venn on her
  body she was an addict herself and prob-
  ably connected with the ring maybe she
  wanted to find out just how much we knew
  about them to ascertain whether or not our
  knowledge was dangerous to the organza-
  tien but who killed her and why m
  no he was asleep or he let us think so at
  least

    who else on the boat would have any
  possible reason the dope-ring presum-
  ably would have profited by knowing just
  how much we knew theres no reason for
  them to kill her unless she intended to dou-
  ble-cross them and they knew it if that
  were the case shed seek out m not us
  why did she try that impersonation there
  was no possible way to uphold it why
  if we knew that wed be one step closer-
  i wonder if she might have been killed
  by mistake in the semi-lighted corridor
  someone waiting outside the door having
  seen us go in and waiting for us to come
  out might have made a mistake-

    there was a knock at the door upon in-
  vitation the small secret service man entered
  he spoke in a low voice

    you are alone

    yes

  very well i may speak freely cap-
tain south is not on duty now and as i
have been aboard this vessel only a short
time i do not know where his quarters are
it is important that i see him even if i dis-
turb his well-earned rest none of the
stewards seem to be very much in evidence
at this particular moment or i should not
have disturbed you

  we can direct you to his quarters said
vic may we ask why you want to see
him

  ive been led to believe i can trust you
fellows i must have the set of master keys
that captain south undoubtedly possesses
i intend to search for the gun that was used
last night you see nine persons out of
ten would look at that bullet and see it was
from a  caliber weapon i have precision
measuring instruments with me and i find
that its the merest trifle too large for a
forty-five

  it is from a venusian weapon with the
unusual caliber known as  kkri in
venusian measurement guns of that cali-
ber are very rare i must have the captains
set of master keys and the sooner the bet-
ter if i find a hidden seven-thirty-seven
wc may learn who did the killing last night
and why it was done

  dick dubrocq explained in detail how the
captains quarters could be reached and the
little man left them

  come with me said vic you and i
are going to interview the planetchief of
mars it strikes me that he might be able
to help us considerably but so far we havent
called upon him at all

  im game said dick and they said
nothing more until the planetchief s secre-
tary admitted them to his presence the
stern ruler paid them the honor of rising
when they entered his stateroom

  gentlemen he said i seldom receive
visitors at such short notice but i should
like you two and mr culbertson to feel
free to call upon me at any time when
we reach mars i shall desire to decorate you
for saving my daughters life in what way
may i be of assistance now

  i do not know how much is known to
you began vic but it has been discover-
in the spacesphere



ed that there is a ring of narcotic smugglers
aboard this vessel their business is the
illegal transportation of martian venn to
earth and venus

kt am fully aware of the existence of the

  x rin as you call it replied the
planetchief i stated once that politics on
mars often become very bitter i am hated
by millions on mars there is a very good
reason for that feeling the organization
that is smuggling venn from mars is per-
haps larger than you suspect there are
millions upon millions of earth-dollars pro-
fit in the drug-traffic but it lives on blood
and human misery the immense political
group that is opposing my rule sometimes
even by violence is organized and financed
by the narcotic ring they want to get rid
of me

  i have the reputation of being stern
perhaps so i am just it is a matter of
common knowledge upon three planets that
captured smugglers and venn-agents and
sellers are always rigidly prosecuted on
mars and if found guilty immediately and
severely punished i insist upon such meas-
ures although it is impossible to completely
enforce the stringent martian narcotic laws

  if i were replaced by a weak or a cor-
rupted ruler the venn-distributing organi-
zation could acquire many more millions
of earth-dollars and venus-tuals than it now
does venn has legitimate medical uses
it should be controlled i am doing so to
the best of my ability and i am cordially
hated by thousands millions of the inhabi-
tants of mars who are swayed by the pro-
paganda of revolution and revolt spread by
the political groups which are directly
financed by the illegal distribution of a
deadly narcotic

  thank you we have been wondering
about the motives behind that attempted kid-
napping do you happen to know the iden-
tity of any member of the ring

  of only one and by description only
an earth-woman refined and gentle in ap-
pearance is a member of the inner circle
of the organization i believe that by earth-
standards she would be considered beautiful

i do not know the name but recently one
of my personal agents has obtained evidence
of her membership in the ring of course
as long as she does not appear on the planet
mars i can do nothing to her the organi-
zation has many representatives on the other
planets

  is she rather taller than the average
with extremely light hair and blue eyes
the planetchiefs eyes suddenly gleamed
yes that is her description as reported
to me

  she or someone like her attempted to
impersonate a secret agent of the world
federation and was mysteriously killed sev-
eral hours ago we are seeking her identity
and the cause of her death it is inexplain-
able

  we thank you said vic your time
is probably valuable and we wont trespass
on any more of it

  no matter i am under a very great
obligation to you please convey my salu-
tations to mr culbertson

  we shall promised dick please ac-
cept our wishes for the speedy recovery of
your daughter

  the planetchief said no more outside
in the corridor vic turned to his compan-
ion with a puzzled frown his voice was as
metallic as ever

  ten to one the woman he mentioned is
the one killed by our bullet with the odd
caliber somebody saved us from spilling
what we know to a member of the inner
circle who the planetchief himself and
m are the only persons i can think of
who would have reason to shoot her and i
doubt whether either of them did theres
something funny about this business
yes and if brad doesnt show up soon
im going to be worried

  i am already theres been too much
killing on this vessel the organization
commits cold-blooded murder with no more
compunction than-

they had just rounded a turn in the
corridor in a heap on the floor was
the slight figure of the mild-looking unob-
trusive little man who was operative m
for a moment they thought he was dead


wonder stories

examination however soon showed that the
man had only been stunned a sizable
lump on his head showed by its position
that he had been struck from behind by some
heavy object powerfully wielded a little
patience and a little water brought him to

  he had not the slightest idea who had
hit him but the group of master keys he
had obtained by which every door on the
vessel could be opened was missing no
hope of making a careful search for the
weapon now its rare caliber would have
made it very incriminating evidence if it
had been found and microscopic examin-
ation could verify the fact that the bullet
in question had been fired from it the lit-
tle man explained all this in a voice that was
trying hard but unsuccessfully to conceal an
extreme chagrin operative m had been
very neatly robbed without getting a glimpse
of hi assailant

  they took leave of him immediately and
attempted to locate the boy named joe
stubalski orderly number  but joe was
mysteriously absent too none of the other
orderlies had seen him since their break-
fast it took about ten minutes to establish
that joe was totally missing

  dick was worried finally he disturbed
captain south again and told of brads dis-
appearance and of the orderlys the cap-
tain put in a call for m at his rooms where
he had retired after making sure that the
keys were gone from his pocket repeated
ringing of the ship-phone utterly failed to
elicit the slightest response then captain
south under the assumed name the man was
using had him paged on all the decks by
the loud speaking announcing system there
was no response and none of the orderlies
who searched the ship for him located the
mild little man any place aboard the whole
immense spacesphere

chapter vi
mistaken identity

perative m of the world secret
service was missing

after half an hour of search and inde-
cision vic and dick decided to enter the

two-room suite that the little man had en-
gaged from venus to mars the corridor
door opened into a small parlor but a
spring lock was automatically keeping the
door fastened from the inside as the mas-
ter keys were not available the giant du-
brocq hurled his weight against the door
once the lock gave he stumbled in
vic followed him and captain south was
close behind them for a moment all three
stood motionless appalled at what they
saw

  in a coagulated pool of his own blood lay
joe stubalski orderly 

  just one more killing said vic sourly
this makes about seven in the last day or
so observe the document in the right
hand

  what oh i see youre observant
vic what is it

  gingerly vic removed a small bloody
rectangle of paper from the hand of the
dead orderly it was a piece of earth-cur-
rency a hundred dollar note

  captain south went to the ship-phone and
called doctor kunzie

  suppose we see whats in the bedroom
suggested vic pushing open the door be-
tween the two rooms say come here
something hellish is loose on this ship

  vics voice was quivering the other two
jumped to the door vic was kneeling be-
side another figure that of bradley culbert-
son and a third was sprawled out absurdly
a few feet away it was the little man on
the floor between them was a venusian gun
of caliber  kkri

  brads hardly scratched just stunned
said vic with a gasp of relief m has
checked out weve got to find out who did
this before-attaboy brad-hes coming
around

  doctor kunzie entered examined the two
dead men rapidly and then helped vic re-
vive brad solemnly he opened his eyes
and looked around

  who did the shooting asked dick 

  m killed joe and shot me i got him
said brad slowly you see hes not m
m- is that woman whom this impostor
killed last night

  impossible exclaimed captain south
in the spacesphere



  let me explain said brad before
you awoke dick i went to the radio-room
after donning some clothes and a pair of
your ruhber-soled shoes i couldnt sleep
you see and i was suspicious thanks vic
a drinks just what i want dont worry
doctor that scratch on the scalp isnt dan-
gerous ive only been out a few minutes

  i sent a cosmic radio message in an in-
tricate code i devised to the federation of
earth-nations i knew that experts on
earth would be able to penetrate the cipher

  about three hours later i received an
answer in the same code it gave me an
authentic description of m she is the
woman who was killed last night the radio
operator will confirm my statements
he sent and received the messages for
me meanwhile while the identity of the
woman was still unknown to me the doctor
here permitted me to examine her body

  i performed certain well-known chemical
tests for venn in her blood or rather for
the end-product that venn finally changes
into she was entirely negative and i began
to think that the venn was planted on her
body after the shooting

  after the message finally arrived i
shadowed our little impostor and selected
a good moment to blackjack him from be-
hind

  t t e didnt hear me approach in your

  i-a shoes dick i took the master keys
he had obtained from the captain and start-
ed to search his rooms as quickly as possi-
ble i located the gun he used last night
-that seven thirty-seven also i found the
most complete set of forgers tools imag-
inable inks of all kinds ink-removers of
all sorts pens papermending tools that can
splice two sheets of paper without leaving a
tract of the joining and samples-i won-
der where he got them-of all sorts of gen-
uinely officially watermarked papers

  and i found a uniform somewhat re-
sembling captain souths except of course
that there were no insignia such as the cap-
tain wears on his neck-band so i knew
what had happened an interview with joe
stubalski confirmed what i had guessed
i called him here and showed him what i

had found he broke down and confessed
although the little man had bribed him
with that century note to keep silent

  with the pseudo-uniform the man had
had the nerve to impersonate captain south
he looked genuine enough the woman ac-
cepted him without question as the genuine
commander particularly when joe came
up apparently by accident and addressed
him as captain south she permitted him
to take her credentials to be placed in the
safe for captains of interplanetary vessels
are always men who have proved through-
out many years that they possess the high-
est type of honor and dependability dont
blush captain she would not have let
any ordinary person have the credentials
she told about the interview she wanted and
to make it look genuine the man dispatched
joe with the message to us

  then he left her went to his room and
made a hurried forgery of the credentials
it was easy enough to substitute photographs
but ticklish when it came to altering the
name and the physical description of size
weight sex and so on to fit his specifica-
tions he managed to do it splicing in
some of his contraband paper tinted just
right with his splendid assortment of inks
the great seal of the federation was gen-
uine

  he presented these credentials and for
safety to prevent us from finding anything
wrong if we checked up he had captain
south dispatch joe with the same message
the woman had sent of course joe did
not disturb us a second time he just left
the captains presence

  but our impostor had to kill the real
m if he wanted to be safe and he wanted
something of an alibi so he told the cap-
tain he would retire the captain sent joe
with the second message but joe didnt de-
liver it because of contrary orders from the
little man if we didnt keep our appoint-
ment the girl might be suspicious and on
her guard you know the rest i suppose

  when the little man came here he made
the mistake of shooting joe first i had
overlooked a gun he had when i stunned
him when he shot joe i dodged into the
bedroom and got that seven-thirty-seven he


wonder stories

had hidden in here i wonder why he want-
ed those keys

nearing mars

brad handed the set of keys to captain
south

  i cant oppose your story admitted the
captain the little man seemed genuine
when did you get joes message

  about eight twenty-five said dick
hm  sent joe to you the first time
just after nine thirty youre right cul-
bertson he had almost an hour in which
to make the forgery nervy all right i
suppose he is a member of the ring

  im quite sure look in his inner pock-
ets

  vic vincennes did so and returned with a
handful of small thin folded papers each
they found contained ten grains of pure
venn he planted those others on her
body drawled vic

  how asked dick can we explain the
fact that the agents of the planetchief de-
scribe the woman as a member of the nar-
cotic ring

  quite probable the code-message from
earth in response to my inquiries told me
that for several years she had been play-
ing a desperate lone game pretending to
be one of the ring she gained the confi-
dence of the inner group and probably had
accumulated very valuable evidence re-
cently somehow they discovered that she
was a spy and you see managed to get rid
of her the man with the little chin carried
out his orders quite efficiently

  i see the planetchiefs operatives
thought-

  vic vincennes exploring further the
pockets of the pseudo-m discovered a
square of paper from which one end had
been torn off he read it and handed it to
brad it was brief and to the point

  kill dubrocq culbertson and vincennes
within six hours destroy this note immedi-
ately n ar

well said vic were slated for death
n a said the herculean dick hm
say nathan axelmann is on board the

new york financier i wonder if hes mix-
ed up in this-

  few people know it said captain south
slowly but we also have aboard with us
the venerable old martian norr avornu
he is the recognized head of the political
party opposing the rule of the present plan-
etchief avornu stays closly in his rooms
an old man i am told

  but this is earth-script- began dick
of course it was written to an earth-
man who wouldnt understand martian
well said dick if we three want to
live well have to force a showdown soon
yes said vincennes damn soon
they left doctor kunzie to his gruesome
task and walked back toward the navigation
room weve made exceptionally good
time said the captain ive crowded the
speed up to three thousand miles a second
plus the modern generators we possess
can give very rapid acceleration that is also
very smooth by the way in an hour from
now our artificial gravity will be reduced
to the mars-normal instead of the earth-
normal we are using now terrestrials and
venusians will have to wear positive gravity
harnesses set at approximately  to in-
crease the pull on their bodies martians
will be able to discard their negative har-
nesses as our present electrogravitation will
be gradually reduced

  they reached the navigation room the
little blood-red disk that was mars gleamed
through the thick windows of quartzinite
the captain spoke again gloomily

  in less than three hours well have land-
ed on mars and our last chance to strike
a blow at this murderous organization will
be gone i have been morally certain for
a long time that norr avornu is the brain
of the venn-ring but i have not the slight-
est shred of evidence upon which to hold
him this note proves nothing it might
have been forged it would be necessary to
prove that he wrote it as far as i can see
our hands are tied

bradley culbertson spoke quiet-
ly i think you will find avornu a
gentleman said brad suppose you call
him here for a conference show him the
in the spacesphere



 note and mention that although you have
 nothing but that and other circumstantial
 evidence nevertheless things look rather
 suspicious ask him if he has any state-
 ments to make any denials ask him as
 evidence of his good faith to submit to a
 psychological examination

   doctor kunzie was showing me this
 morning a beautiful instrument he possesses
 a marvel of accurate scientific craftsman-
 ship a brand-new and unbelievably delicate
 sphygmopsychometer such as are used by
 the world police organization ysee
 avornu cant fail to realize that a refusal to
 submit to the examination will look bad for
 him if he refuses dont press him if hell
 let you hook him up to the soul machine
 and ask him all the questions you want to
 about the venn-ring doctor kunzie is an
 experienced and competent psychologist
 he can take a look at the charts made by the
 instrument and tell you whether the man is
 lying or not

   by jove i never thought of that angle
 of attack exclaimed captain south
 well do it at once he reached for a
 speaking tube

   one moment captain said brad one
 of us three should stay with you as a wit-
 ness of the interview i suggest that it be
 vic here dick and i would be superflu-
 ous and im expecting a message from mars
 any moment

   bradley culbertson rose to leave and
 dick accompanied him leaving vic and the
 captain wondering just what he meant
 dick tried to question him as they walked
 down a deeply carpeted corridor brad
 would answer nothing

    believe me dick ive got a good reason
 for not telling you what i know yet theres
 a fifty-fifty chance that there may be hell
 let loose on this flyer in a little while i
 know what im doing i want you to search
 all the decks for kee scarna shes recov-
 ered from that sanzan but shes still rather
 weak she may be in great danger and i
 know you dont want her to be in any sort
 of danger find her and ask her to go to
 her room until we reach mars see that
 she promises you to stay there

i	all right brad youre the professor

said richard dubrocq what are you go-
ing to do in the meantime

  two-fifths of a smile played across cul-
bertsons sober lips im going to the
ships library and see if i can find a copy of
doctor gnansons scholarly work the
theory and practical applications of para-
electricity its a branch of physics ive
always wanted to study

chapter vii
a counter revolution

one hour later the ships announcing
system warned the passengers that the
change of gravity was soon to take place
earthmen and venusians donned gravity-
harnesses of thin silver bands attached to
ludicrously small para-electric pocket bat-
teries the currents of para-electricity set
up could be made at will to increase or de-
crease the electrogravitational puli upon the
individual who controlled them terres-
trials and venusians adjusted their positive
harnesses so that the mars-normal gravity
wouldnt send them flying around at every
step martians discarded the negative har-
nesses which had kept the earth-normal
gravitation from harming their bodies

  shortly after the change dubrocq came
to the library i finally located her maid
who says that shes feeling indisposed and
hasnt risen yet shell be safe i suppose
the maid says that she wont rise until we
reach mars

  vic vincennes arrived vic was attempt-
ing to suppress a certain amount of excite-
ment

  well inquired brad

  doctor kunzie gave avornu a clean
slate he cooperated with us and the
psychomechanical evidence absolutely ab-
solves him he said that he knew of the
existence of the ring but he denied any
connection with it any psychologist in the
solar system would have sworn he was tell-
ing us the truth not the slightest micro-
scopic deflection of the recording styli
i expected it said brad

it astounded captain south hes run-
ning around in mental circles at present


wonder stories

do you suppose that martian can control
his nervous organization to such and ex-
tent that hfc can lie to a sphygmopsycho-
meter and get away with it

  i have not studied the nervous anatomy
of martians closely enough to hazard an
opinion said brad academically it
might be possible has any official mes-
sage come from mars yet

  not that i know-

  the spacespheres announcing system
broke in stating that captain south would
like to meet dubrocq culbertson and vin-
cennes in the radioroom

  the operator was bending over his instru-
ments when they entered captain south
was holding a sheaf of message blanks re-
garding the topmost with astonishment and
anxiety ah said brad a cosmic radio-
gram from mars

  yes said the captain dully weve
lost our chance this radiogram announces
that the established government of mars has
been overthrown completely by a short and
deadly scientific revolution zon scarna
and his daughter are exiled forever forbid-
den to land on mars for the time being
the revolutionists have picked norr avornu
who seems to be the popular idol to take
charge of the complete reorganization of the
planets government norr avornu has
absolute power at present

  i knew it yesterday said brad cul-
bertson i suppose you have sent copies of
the message to norr avornu and to zon
scarna

  yes just a moment ago they must
have them by now

  hm i wish you hadnt i wanted to
intercept that message its a peculiar trick
of fate to have both the present and the de-
posed ruler on board at the same time i
wish i knew more of martian psychology-

the unmistakable sound of an explosive
bullet detonating on impact interrupt-
ed brad he rushed to the door and out
into the corridor while the others stood mo-
tionless for a fraction of a second startled
four more explosive shots were heard in
rapid succession

  theyre gunning for brad said vic un-

der his breath he and dick and the captain
leaped toward the corridor door a figure
confronted them then in a second four more
appeared all martians and all with an au-
tomatic or a ray-pistol in each hand the
first was zon scarna his face was no
longer stern and expressionless but showed
plainly anger-cold calculating and en-
tirely merciless he spoke

  some of my men now have control of
the navigation room and of the second and
third officers of this spaceship others are
guarding well norr avornu an old fool
you captain south and the other officers
are i fear the only men aboard who know
enough of celestial navigation to safely han-
dle this spaceflyer from now on i shall
command if you obey and if everyone else
aboard obeys me i guarantee that most of
the passengers for whose lives you are re-
sponsible will not be harmed in any way
with norr avornu in my power i shall
proceed to dictate terms to mars all of
you will now proceed to the navigation
room

  they did so silently well-covered by the
weapons of the desperate ex-ruler of mars
and his followers the second and third
officers of the cosmonia were helpless fac-
the guns of more of zon scarnas men the
former planetchief spoke again his voice
level and cold

  as for you dubrocq and you vincen-
nes and your friend who tried to get
away i shall kill you now you three in
particular have meddled with things that
do not concern you your friend was
wounded or killed in his foolish flight an
orderly who tried to resist us is dead cul-
bertson is lying in the corridor now prob-
ably dead too i must make sure

  he spoke to two of his men in martian
telling them to get brad whether he was
dead or alive and bring him to the naviga-
tion room

  i shall kill you three with the poisoned
needle-gun and my men will immediately
give you burial in space you and your
officers captain will watch me with such
composure as you may have at your com-
mand and realize that i will brook no in-
terference whatever that i do not and shall
in the spacesphere

si

not hesitate to eliminate anyone who annoys
me

  the two martians returned from the cor-
ridor empty handed the planetchiefs
countenance hardened vic vincennes saw
him lift his needle-gun at pointblank range
and felt an intolerable weight falling upon
him crushing the very life from him he
crumbled to the floor overcome with nau-
sea the room seemed to be spinning the
sickness more acute and more horrible
then unconsciousness

brad explains

in the dynamo-room in the very center of
the enormous sphere a figure lay recum-
bent lipon the floor another pulled a
huge double-throw knife-switch into its off-
position and began a systematic process of
disconnecting other switches his hands were
bare-he ran the risk of death by para-
electricity the strange cold energy sec-
ond cousin to electricity-but so expert was
his manipulation that he did not give the
thousands of ampores of cold juice a
chance to short through his body

  brad culbertson glanced at the man he
had felled and proceeded to the navigation
room on the floor were the motionless
bodies of vic and dick of captain south
and the other officers there were also ten
shapeless masses all that was left of zon
scarna and his martian aides dick du-
brocq of the mighty physique soon revived
and helped brad revive vic and the other
earthmen the mangled bodies of the mar-
tians were removed by the ships orderlies
under the direction of the wondering doc-
tor kunzie

  suppose you explain brad suggested
vic pointedly dick and i and these offi-
cers would like to know what its all about
 as briefly as possible began brad the
situation is this for many years zon scarna
has been the hidden brain of the venn-smug-
gling organization but not until very re-

the ampore is the para-electric unit corresponding
to the ampere of ordinary electricity as electricity
produces electromagnetic fields so para-electricity pro-
duces positive or negative electrogravitational fields
by which interplanetary vessels are propelled para-
electric generators derive their power from coal oil
and synthetic fuels just as ordinary generators do

cently was this known to the martian peo-
ple in general zon scarna would permit no
competition any unfortunate martian who
took up the smuggling business on his own
initiative was soon ferreted out tried and
condemned to death

  thus scarna furthered his own inter-
ests by reducing competition at the same
time throwing a smoke screen across his own
trail he gained a reputation for stern and
righteous justice the venus- and earth-
governments approved most heartily of his
actions but this apparently righteous ruler
was the carefully hidden brain behind the
venn-ring

  incidentally dick his one and only re-
deeming feature was his love for that daugh-
ter of his she knows nothing of her
fathers real character or occupation she
was the only thing he was capable of loving
and he would have been genuinely grate-
ful to us for saving her life if it hadnt been
completely demolishing his plans and if
you hadnt let him hear you say you loved
her he didnt intend to have any earth-
man take that girl away from him-

  he brought aboard an extra trunkload
o venn and had it smuggled off at venus
under cover of invisibility remember how
willing he was to submit to the attempted
kidnapping he engineered the whole
thing in order to be very sure that the in-
conceivably valuable trunkload of the pure
unadulterated narcotic could be landed on
venus he has a hidden landing cradle up-
on the hot planet

  at the regular terminal of the cosmonia
the trunk might have been searched with
xx-rays for the venusians dont observe
the custom of exempting rulers through
courtesy he planned the abduction by
supposed venusian brigands but when the
meteor struck the vessel causing it to leak
air scarna came back to the cosmonia with-
out giving his hand away you recall that
he was not under restraint on the alien ves-
sel dick although he appeared to have been
so of course with his daughter poisoned
he returned without protest to the cosmonia
where expert medical aid was obtainable i
think kee scarna has suspected something
wrong ever since that abduction fell


wonder stories

through the venn however was success-
fully landed on venus by one of his agents
using the more risky and hitherto secret
process of invisibility stolen by the planet-
chief from the martian savant who in-
vented it

  operative m of the world secret
v- service penetrated his secret and in-
formed the federation of earth-nations the
planetary council of venus and the heads
of the perfectly legitimate political organ-
izations opposing zon scarnas rule on
mars a very remarkable woman m its
a shame she was killed

  i obtained all this information yesterday
from the federation of earth-nations in re-
ply to my code message but at that time
zon scarna was still ruler of mars and
youd hardly have believed me anyhow
with the knowledge and consent of norr
avornu his party led the almost instantan-
eous revolution on mars gaining complete
control of the planet that was what i was
waiting for for as soon as that news came
through we could arrest zon scarna and per-
haps put an end to these attempts on our
lives

  you are wondering perhaps about those
initials i could hardly keep from smiling
at you when you interpreted n a to mean
norr avornu none of you seemed to re-
call a fact that is undoubtedly known to
you all the martian system and it is no
less logical than ours is to consider the
last symbol in the name as the initial rather
than the first and even when his name was
phonetically transliterated into terrestrial
spelling he kept the same system n a
plainly and straightforwardly signified zon
scarna

  when i heard that shot today-the shot
that killed a totally innocent orderly who
happened to be standing in the martians
way i saw clearly in a second what had hap-
pened in zon scarnas mind always bold
he would capture the unarmed ship then
with norr avornu as hostage he would be
iu a position to dictate terms to mars

  i rushed out and he shot at me the ex-
plosive bullet missed me but i fell volun-
tarily and lay quiet while other bullets went

over me and struck the corridor wall demol-
ishing it in places if he had only fired
one bullet he would have seen by the dam-
age it did to the wall some distance away
that he had missed me

  when he and the others went into the
radioroom i made a successful break for
the generator room i didnt have time to
argue with the man on duty there so i hit
him on the temple from behind i dis-
connected the para-electric cables that sup-
plied artificial gravitation to many of the
rooms of the ship i hooked them all to the
cables that carried the para-juice to the
navigation-room gravity-field circuits and
cut in all the generators for seven seconds
anything longer would have burnt out the
coils

  i robbed the rest of the ship to concen-
trate our gravitational power here you
with sturdy terrestrial bodies were able to
stand it for a few seconds without serious
or permanent injury in spite of the fact
that you are wearing positive gravity-har-
nesses the martians of much frailer phy-
sique were crushed to death immediately
apparently just at the most opportune time
you may not have noticed it vic but theres
a poisoned needle-dart sticking in the rug
just three inches in front of your left foot

  thats about all i reconnected the para-
electric cable cofrectly and came here ask-
ing doctor kunzie to come with me his
office was horribly disarranged by the tem-
porary cessation of gravity im sorry all
of his instruments and medicines floated
around the room at random it couldnt
be helped-

  im sorry for kee scarna- began du-
brocq weakly

  the shock is going to hurt the little prin-
cess drawled vic but shes take it stand-
ing shes a thoroughbred yet someone
ought to take care of her shes just a kid
of eighteen or so according to earth-time
alone in the universe itll be up to you
dick i saw her fall for you when you
spilled her wine and ive watched you fall
son ask her dick the invulnerable social
barrier is gone but shes a martian girl
and wouldnt think it proper to take the first
step herself shes exiled from mars its
in the spacesphere



tip to you to take her back to earth and
make her forget-

alls well

dick had turned away flushed doubt-
ful afraid vic stopped talking he
posed as a cynic vic vincennes it wouldnt
do to show any emotion the others never
knew that vic loved the girl too vic would
have denied that he knew what love was had
anyone asked him which nobody did vic
vincennes changed the subject

  what about norr avornu he ejacu-
lated dryly according to zon scarna
avornu was well guarded by several men
most probably he still is -

  captain south started pulled open a
drawer and abstracted four automatics
wed forgotten him lets investigate at
once the others took the proffered wea-
pons and started toward the door of the
navigation room vic vincennes in the
lead collided with something he couldnt
see it was a moment before he found his
voice

  an invisible cylinder he exclaimed
rubbing his forehead what in the-
the cylinder wasnt directly in the path
one would ordinarily take while entering or
leaving the room vic had blundered into
it by accident the giant dubrocq stooped
put his arms around the glass he could not
see and brought his tremendous strength
into play he lifted the seven-foot high
thick heavy glass cylinder into the air and
set it down again several feet away cul-
bertsons low voice rang in his ears

  dick i depended on you to keep her
away god ive crushed her to death

   for on the floor revealed when the cylin-
der was moved was a pitiful little heap of
blue and silver

   kee scarna however was not dead when
her father had received the message an-
nouncing his defeat she had donned slip-
pers and had thrown a blue and silver silken
robe over her pajamas and-

  she tried to warn us said dick he
hpd picked her up in his arms had seen
that she had not discarded her negative
gravity-harness of thin silver bands in-

stinctively when she felt the gravity increas-
ing she had turned the tiny dial on the
band about her waist increasing the strength
of the negative force that protected her it
had not been enough to prevent her from
falling unconscious with pain but it had
saver her from being crushed she was
breathing regularly slender and beautiful
in the giants arms he was carrying her to
the doctors office the others were with
him but richard dubrocq paid no atten-
tion to them he bowed his head and kissed
her pale lips her warm white throat then
he looked at vic and his eyes were sombre

  youre wrong vic if youll think a
minute youll see shell get over her at-
tachment for me interplanetary marriages
are so seldom happy theres too great a
physical and psychic difference she
wouldnt be happy i owe it to her to drop
out of her life before she does something
shell regret all her life she been a dead
game sport i can be one too

   viv looked again at the girls tear-stained
face you are right dick i was wrong
he said and for once in vics life his voice
held no irony no bitterness no edge

  the giant relinquished his burden to the
patient and overworked kunzie take care
of her doctor please he asked and turned
to join the others they proceeded to norr
avornus stateroom but received no response
upon knocking repeatedly the captain
opened the door with a master key

  the venerable norr avornu held a weap-
on in each hand covering two martians
who were cowering against the opposite wall
of the room norr avornu smiled pleasant-

 ly-

  ah gentlemen said he i am much
relieved i feared you might be the reen-
forcements these two individuals seem to
desire i take it that you have the situation
well under control

  yes said vic smiling a little as he
gazed at four deadly martian ray-pistols on
the floor would you mind telling me
sir how you gained the upper hand on
these-er-gentlemen  

it was indeed most fortuitous for some
reason the gravity in this chamber failed

wf ixfe believe that this 
  rr story is an extraor-
  dinary one coming from the
  pen of a sixteen year-old
  author it would do credit
  to the name of a mature
  experienced writer

     man with his tremendous
   development of science may
   be considered as a child
   fumbling about in the dark
   of a great cavern he
   stretches out his hands and
   finds things that he puts
   to his own use and they
   serve him well but the
   nature of the things that he
   finds and uses is still a
   mystery to him and as he
   plumbs deeper and deeper
   into natures laws to find
   new devices for himself he
   may be intruding into a
   world that he does not
   understand

    so science may easily
  prove a boomerang to man
  and destroy hem in the pro-
  cess of civilizing him our
  brilliant young author has
  taken this theme and woven
  into it a finely conceived

                      inches from the drum

                    the little dynamo
                  turned suddenly
                  slowly at first and
                  then with rapidly in-
                  creasing speed until it
                  had become a blurred
                  whirling shape from
                  which came a shrilly

                   pall was clouding up
                   around the paper-
                   weight it began to

                   dissolving   

                  the hum rose to

 to the spot where the glass sphere had been

 he was feeling something that he could not
 seel

  before him resting on the smooth sur-
  face of the desk was a small object it
  was in the form of a hollow drum about a
  foot in diameter in the center of which re-
  posed a tiny model of an electric dynamo

wentworth chairman in this year 
ad of new york city-state was closed
and locked his prim efficient secretary
had received her orders and to the many
and varied numbers who came seeking aud-
ience with the great man she gave the in-
variable answer

  hes i n confer

  in the large luxur-
uriously fitted room
room mr wentworth
was in conference he
sat behind his permen-
tite desk staring with
some misgivings at
the two stalwart gen-
tlemen who confront-
ed him

  one was a very tall
thick-set and deter-
mined looking man
whose attitude at the
moment was one of an
insistent request for
attention the other
smaller wizened but
evidently more prud-
ent looked on in si-
lence

  the two small paste-
boards o n went-
worths desk read

hend  rail science
engineers t o the
councillor there
seemed something fam-
iliar about the first of
these names then
he remembered he
had read not long before of the promin-
ence and brilliance of the engineer-physi-
cist arnold hend who had announced his
intentions to visit america from his home
land germany on some errand whose na-
ture he refused to reveal

  but the smallei engineer whom the big
man had called hend was silent rail
had evidently been delegated to do the talk-
ing

 it was weird uncanny the sweat
 formed on his forehead he drew his hand
 back

 enough

  rail snapped the other switch ho
grinned convinced chairman

  yes what i have seen would have re-
moved the most obstinate of doubts but
its-its-dazing-stupendous-you have
achieved invisibility how 

  for an instant rand hesitated then
questioningly he glanced at hend the third
man in the room who had maintained an
enigmatic silence

  arnold is much better at that than i

 bending light we have intensified by
 dynamo of our own construction the whole
 vast magnetic field of gravity into a direct-
 ed channel

   you saw the result invisibility the
 incalculably powerful field of force which
 was centered on the paperweight so bent the
 light rays which made it visible to us that
 they passed around it instead of being ab-
 sorbed or reflected if gravity were pure
 electromagnetism however the effect
 would be a sort of dark hole in space
 blotting out still the sight of objects around
 it but gravity though akin to magnetism
 is a separate distinct force with the result
 that it not only bends light but renders
 those substances which come under its direct
 influence extremely per-
 meable to light reflected
 from other matter thus
 t h e paperweight com-
 pletely vanished

                   wentworths face mir-
                 rored his struggle with
                 incredulity he said
                 abruptly

                      let me see that again
                    rail made a gesture of
                    impatience h e flung
                    the tiny switch once
                    more the vibrant sound of
                    the little machine on the
                    desk filled the room

 weniworth put out his
 hand for the second time
 expectantly and then
 annoyance on his face he
 passed his fingers over the surface of the
 desk in a searching motion

after a moment

   i cant feel it whats the matter its
 gone 

   unbelieving rail stared at him hend
 had stiffened curiously at his first words a
 strange expression on his strained face-
 the expression of one who suddenly finds
 an oft-expressed fear confirmed within
 him   

he whispered hoarsely half to himself

   john i-weve made a mistake-its
 too big for us for our puny machine-we
 were too confident in ourselves    why

hend flushed for a while he remained
silent and then in a guttural ger-
man voice which however was untainted
by any accent he spoke

  it is verv simole we have onlv taken

advantage of something
that all men have known
for a hundred years that
gravity is a form of elec-
tromagnetism einstein
told us that in the twen-
tieth century

  we have always been
able in our day to pro-
duce powerful magnetic
fields and to intensify
them to a degree limited
only by our supply of
energy

 around u s unno-
ticed apparently by all
men with the exception
of john and myself is the
hugest magnetic field of	frank it kelly

our experience one of
the most vast sources of energy conceivable
-earths gravity

  science has long known once more
from einstein that a powerful magnetic
field has a perceptible effect on light rays
passing through it light beams crossing
the sun were observed to have been turned
measurably from their normal path when
under the direct influence of the stars tre-
mendous though unconcentrated magnetic
field resulting in the phenomena of light-
bending

  rail and i have simply combined these
two facts that gravity is akin to magne-
tism and that magnetism has the power of
the light bender



its bigger than matter itself dont you
see  it has warped the very sub-
stance of that paperweight as it has bent
its light   

  i tell you ive always feared it such
power was never intended for man   
we must give it up john while we have the
chance

  his face was drawn into a mask of terror
his voice trembled his hands shook and
then as suddenly as it had come the paro-
xysm of fear left him he fell back into his
chair weakly

  rail snarled contemptuously he swept
his great hand out over the desk

  he gave an exclamation of pain rubbed
bruised knuckles he laughed

  you simply missed it councillor its
there now right enough

  he dismissed the incident as a mistake
a triviality but in his laughter wentworth
detected an undercurrent of nervous strain

  look

  before them as he snapped the releasing
switch once more the little weight was com-
ing into view the vagueness about its sur-
face was melting slowly

  again a flicker of victory gleamed in
rails eyes it was short-lived

the great plan

the glass sphere on the desk-top had
changed there was an indefinable
difference in its appearance a shadowy
impressive indistinctness of outline a dark-
ness about its surface   

  it had lost its prosaic look it seemed a
part of another altogether different world-

  wentworth was conscious of a vague
foreboding his mind was crowded with
the tremendous possibilities that lay in the
tiny innocent-appearing drum surely such
a little thing could hold no threat of dan-
ger of menace

  with a feeling almost akin to awe in his
heart wentworth stared fascinated at the
inventors of this wonder

  hend the older more cynical was a
small sharp-featured man grayed by years
and made skeptical with experience

  rail almost a giant physically with a

genial nature and an insuppressible optim-
ism had a keen ever-active brain that re-
fused to admit the existence of the impos-
sible his was an absolutely fearless tem-
perament

  between them the engineers formed an
almost irresistible combination friends of
long standing each complemented the other
in nature intelligence and outlook   

  wentworth remembered his dogged re-
luctance to be convinced and marveled at
his now firm belief but this demonstra-
tion had put an end to all his doubts   

  to the engineers the enlistment in their
cause of wentworth chairman of the exe-
cutive council of new york city-state and
by far the most powerful man in the city
meant all closer than they had ever
thought possible before loomed realization
of their lifes dream invisibility on a prac-
tical scale they had visions of crime
wiped from the face of the earth by an in-
visible law force of even the possibility of
war abolished by the establishment of an
international peace fleet that invisible
would patrol the airways of the world

  to wentworth invisibility meant an in-
calculable advance to the civilization of
man and particularly to his beloved city
a stupendous power with infinite promises
of good

  each accepted as sacred the duty of pre-
senting this new force to the world and
each searched his brain for a plan that
should be both fitting and impressive

  it was alvin wentworth who first broke
the lengthening silence

  my friends you have much work be-
fore you we have yet to convince the
world that invisibility is possible so you
must have some place of absolute secrecy
in which to complete your task that
which i have in mind is ideal the interior
of the peace tower  i alone possess
the means of entrance it has been closed
to the public for twenty years its very
obviousness will protect you  and
finally when you are ready it will oher a
splendid means of demonstrating your pow-
er to the world 

  he paused his gaze went from one to
the other inquiringly


wonder stories

  rail was obviously eager acquiescent
and upon the calm face of hend was sup-
reme resignation a fear conquered though
not denied   

  what is your answer

  our answer is yes

  it was rails voice vibrant impatient
the germans head gave a slow nod   
the bargain was complete

  then come

down here on the very bottom level of
the city canyons there was an eery
atmosphere of loneliness the cold white
gleam of the great street globes cast a green-
ish lifelessness over the vast stretches of de-
serted pavement the looming enormity of
the buildings that pressed closely in upon
the little street gave an overwhelming im-
pression of insignificance to the three who
huddled in the long shadow of a crimson
tower   

  wentworth sent a white hissing beam
leaping out suddenly from a queer-shaped
cylinder in his gloved hand it struck
crashingly against crimson metal   

  there was an abrupt startling click a
tiny disc embedded in the red wall had re-
volved in a slow measured movement   

  the white beam flashed out again and
again this time with a whirring reluctant
groan the disc turned upon itself

  an instants pause then once more that
crashing cone of coruscating force-and si-
lently the scarlet barrier before them was
opening into a dark cavern whose height was
hardly higher than a man   

  wentworth turned his low hoarse voice
whispered

  you have one minute 

 they gripped hands with one last
glance over their shoulders the engineers
were gone   

  wentworth was left to stand alone

	 

  with an impatience born of two months
fruitless waiting for some word from those
to whom he had given admittance to the
tower wentworth reached eagerly for the
communication cylinder upon his desk

  with trembling fingers he loosened the
metal cap he held it over the desk

  there was a dull thud on the smooth
surface of the wood lay a tiny roll of metal-
lic substance

  wentworth inserted it quickly in a slot
that ran the length of a small compact
machine on one corner of his desk he de-
pressed a lever   

  an instants pause then

  to our chairman councillor wentworth
greetings knowing your anxiety and pro-
bable uneasiness over our continued failure
to report our progress in the enterprise
which we have undertaken we must apolo-
gize for our negligence but events since
last we saw you have followed in such rapid
order and with such bewildering marvel-
ousness that we have almost lost track of
time

 we have succeeded far beyond our
dreams within one week after the dis-
patching of this report the first light-bend-
er will have been completed and we shall
be ready to convince the world in an in-
dubitable manner that our discovery is a
practical reality

  necessity requires that this report be
brief at high noon on the twenty-fifth of
this month sol we shall in accordance
with the plan which you outlined to us on
that first day remove from the sight of man
the greatest of all his works-the peace
tower in which we are    until then-

  the lifelike voice of rail ceased went-
worth felt a great relief surging over his
soul

  his fears had heen vain after all he
had nothing on which to base them except
the queer distorted appearance of the paper-
weight upon the desk    but as he
thought of that distortion his fears returned
again augmented by a greater fear

  what if as hend had feared the incon-
ceivable power generated by the engineers
machine was capable of warping the mat-
ter as well as the light that came within its
influence there had been some who
claimed that dimension was determined by
rate of vibration    then if the vibration
of the matter made invisible was altered
also might not that matter be translated
into another dimensional plane to be re-
the light bender



turned only in grotesque travesty of its for-
mer shape

  he shuddered refused to think of the al-
ternative  that it might not return at all   
that the sole reason for the return of the
paperweight lay in the comparatively weak
energies of the tiny light-bending model  

  with an effort he arose walked to the
window he looked out upon the vast spec-
tacle of the city asparkle with brilliant
night lights throbbing with a fulsome life
his eyes were for only one thing the huge
overshadowing blotch against the darkness
that was the peace tower    he sighed
soon very soon all his doubts would be
answered  he could only hope

the peace tower goes

suspended between the earth and sky
by a slender pencil of force wentworth
hung motionless and strained his eyes eag-
erly through the eye-pieces of his air-hel-
met his gaze clung fascinatedly to the
vast city that spread out far below him

  new york in  vast spires of shim-
mering chromium whitely brilliant in the
hard-bright sun    wideflung feathery
street bridges of silvery metal    the
floating beryllium islands with their great
traffic beacons    the teeming airways
packed now with homeward winging mil-
lions   

  and most wonderful of all the power
beams-thin streamers of etheric force
pouring out from the laboring solar genera-
tors far beneath the city waves of a myster-
ious negative gravity that held up all who
flew the skies they were the most marvelous
achievement of twenty-first century civili-
zation   

  wentworth if he thought of these things
at all did so with pride of possession
for new vork city-state in  had ac-
knowledged alvin wentworth chairman of
its executive council as its leader

  and in the elections of that fall it had
been wentworth who had stood highest in
the fitness and intelligence tests of his fac-
tion and who had won the biennial contests
for the council by a wide margin   

  he gave no thought to such matters now

body tensed in his flexible metal air-suit
he had eyes for but one point in all the
vast panorama below

  that was a spot near the center of the
city there raising its crimsoned sides
three thousand feet toward the sky was the
peace tower of 

  it was acknowledged the summit of archi-
tectural achievement to its construction
had been brought the best efforts of the
worlds greatest artisans it had been born
of an inspired time-the years immediately
following the holocaust of the third world
war of  when a planet gone mad in
a frenzy of rejoicing from the horrors of
scientific warfare had poured its all into a
stupendous memorial of thanksgiving

  within its hollow core were placed the
plans for all the engines of war then known
to man and the entrance sealed with the
most indestructible shield of force and metal
that ingenuity could devise

  a chamber of equal size decorated lav-
ishly with pictorial representations of the
horrors of war and the benefits of peace
was thrown open to the public for a period
of ten years upon the expiration of that
decade this also was closed by an immense
portal of chrome-steel and the means of en-
trance given into the hands of new yorks
governing body 

  after the completion of the tremendous
structure which required nearly five years
three decades of peace had followed de-
prived even of the wherewithal to carry on
warfare and engrossed in an unprecedent-
ed revival of science and the arts man be--
gan to forget the desire for conflict which
had absorbed his energies for many thou-
sand years

  during this golden period government
became a matter of intelligence and capa-
bility rather than of political cunning
poverty disease and insanity were almost
completely eradicated art literature
science the chief interests of all    man
was coming into his own

  wentworth a half mile above new york
suddenly felt a quiver of emotion stirring
every muscle of his body

  something was happening to the peace
tower


wonder stories

  around its shining brilliant spire a pall
of darkness was swiftly gathering spread-
ing downward devouring remorselessly the
apparently invincible solidity of the mon-
strous edifice   

  and suddenly where a moment before
had been a gigantic sky-reaching structure
was now but a half-defined swiftly-vanish-
ing shadow   

  wentworth waited no longer springing
into swift flight he winged his way above
the city toward his own apartments but
as he went he looked down upon the mill-
ing awe-struck myriads below with a pre-
occupied gaze that partook of something of
their own awe even now he had difficul-
ty in believing that the wonder he had seen
did not contain elements of the supernatur-
al   

  but in seven days all the world should
know the truth and believe with such evi-
dence before it    he must have patience

      ith the beginning of the week of
the darkening alvin wentworth en-
tered upon the most terrible period of his
existence

  for it was at this time that he began to
have visions

  they came to him at night after he had
retired at first they were vague shape-
less of brief duration   

  those he was able to banish but with
the coming of the third night they were
fctronger plainer and-longer they stayed
with him   

  he had dozed off in the drowsy warm
darkness of his room and suddenly start-
ed awake with sweat beads on his clammy
forehead the long shadows in the dark
corners of the room had become cold men-
acing sentient 

  they would creep up to his bed from
those dark corners and lay soft repulsive
dark fingers on his skin    and they
would whisper   

  that was what bothered him most the
whispers    they were something you
couldnt fight    and you had to stay
awake or the fingers would come sliding
around your throat   

  on the fourth night he sensed a change

the shadows were gloating triumphant
over some evil of which he was ignorant
he knew it had to be evil though    the
shadows were all evil   

  that is except two these were never
strong but always he knew they were there
helping him fighting with him trying to
tell him something   

   he could never quite get it they would
whisper and he would lean forward strain
his ears for the soft hissing sound   

   and always the evil shadows would rush
forward drown it out with evil whispers
push the two back into the dark corners  

   and after a long time on the sixth night
he could see another shadow other than
those with which he was familiar this
was vast unmoving-the huge shadow of a
machine   

  when he saw that the two grew more
desperate than ever they would rush tow-
ard him with a terrible force almost break
through the crowding evils-and toward
morning they managed to reach him for a
single instant   

  the whisper came to him tomorrow
and in the middle of it he felt light on his
face and knew that the shadows were gone
 it was day

	 

  on the morning of the seventh day
wentworth sat alone in his private cham-
bers he had given orders that he was not
to be disturbed

   he was trembling at intervals he rose
nervously went to the landing stage outside
his window gazed out upon the vast open
space in the heart of the city that marked
the location of the vanished peace tower

   he stood on the balcony he glanced at
his watch

   almost time 

 in five minutes it would be noon and
hend and rail would reverse the switches
that held the great tower invisible   

   he tried to shake off the growing fear
that obsessed him  he gripped the
railing of the balcony it would not be
long not long 

	and suddenly he was gripped by a cold
terror  a vague shadow had come
suddenly into the sunlight was growing
the light bender



thickening before his dazed eyes into-dark-
ness   

  the air was a shimmering blackness be-
fore him the white stone of the balcony had
turned suddenly to jet black   

  the whole city was plunged abruptly into
a strained menacing shadow   

  he was stunned paralysed but only for
an instant  with a grim effort he
roused himself from his lethargy   

  he hurled himself across the room re-
gardless of the confusing darkness he
went rapidly down the hall to his communi-
cation room   

a message from beyond

a little sob of relief came from his
throat the television was unharmed
the three-foot screen that reared itself from
a clustered mass of apparatus gave forth
the quiet hum that indicated all was well
it glowed dimly in the darkness about it  

  his fumbling fingers found the direct-
ional dial he spun it feverishly   
the hum became a whine a shrill scream
the glow illumined the whole room   

  and suddenly wentworth gasped fas-
cinated he stared at the thing fast becom-
ing visible on the screen   

  instinctively he knew it was not of human
construction and yet there was something
about it familiar a characteristic possessed
by something he had seen before   

  it was monstrous vague menacing-
blacker than the darkness that surrounded
it    it was possessed of a slimy repul-
siveness that nauseated  yet there was
about it for him an indescribable fascina-
tion   

  with a cold finality he knew  he
had seen its shadow   

  wentworth was suddenly conscious of
pain    his whole body was wracked
with an excruciating torture as though each
atom that composed it contended against it-
self   

  the walls of the room were wavering
strangely    the television screen was
going black   

he was conscious of crawling painfully

toward the balcony    his bursting lungs
cried out for air

  his last impression of a sudden cataclys-
mic wrench that shook the universe he
passed into oblivion   

  wentworth raised his head groaned he
gazed about him in a dazed manner

  it was dusk the fading sun sent long
shadows over the little balcony on which he
lay the cool quiet of approaching eve-
ning enveloped him

  the world seemed bathed in healing si-
lence and so content he lay unmoving
for a time gazing up with vagrant fancies
at the twining colors of the heavens

  memory returned to him like a blow he
sat up at once pain forgotten in his emo-
tion he crawled laboriously to the edge
of the little platform looked out over the
city    how long had he lain thus
what events might have passed over his un-
conscious head 

  he passed a hand unbelievingly before
his eyes new york had subtly changed
the human city that he had known seemed
gone beneath him stretched a succession
of grotesque distorted towers holding with-
in them an odd suggestion of darkness fan-
tasy   

  but suddenly far below him something
stirred a single tiny speck in human
form winged its way uncertainly between
the fantastic spires    and presently
there were others growing with increasing
spee into a vast swarm   

  new york was awakening but curious-
ly the knowledge left him with little inter-
est  he was suddenly discerning a fam-
iliar aspect about the nearer towers   
then he knew

  they were still the old well-remembered
towers that he had known before-before
the visit    and remembering a certain
paperweight upon his desk the cause of
their distortion was plain   

  the monster had failed but it had left
its mark upon the city    with a sud-
den shudder he realized how close his my-
riads had been to the brink   

  the thought that followed close upon
realization left him white and shaking the
invaders would return 


wonder stories

 he pulled himself erect he forced him-
 self to walk and found that he had no brok- 
 en bones

 then he saw the cylinder it lay a bat-
 tered little tube of twisted metal close to
 the edge of the balcony

 a sudden suspicion cut his heart there
 were only two men in existence who would
 attempt to communicate with him in that
 manner   

 he stooped picked it up holding it in
 shaking hands he made his way inside sat
 down at his desk

 he pulled his radiophone to him unex-
 pectedly it was still in working order

 give me washington

 along silence broken by a crackling
 discordance of protest from the phone
     then

 washington speaking

 and swiftly at the sound of his voice
 chairman thank god we thought
 you were dead the entrance to your build-
 ing has been blocked with debris for three
 days the president-

 wentworth cut in shortly

 whats happened since it hit here
 hesitation at last

 we dont know bostons been dark
 two days and buffalo-

 bad

 yes  it hasnt been seen since so
 we have hopes    there was a rather bad
 storm last night 

 the voice was unconvincing wentworth
 said

 call me if you get anything new ill
 be here

but-

 he cut the connection he put his head
 in his hands for a long time

 and at last a set look of determination
 on his face he placed the battered little cy-
 linder into the translator

 there was a crackling discordance and
 finally strained unnatural came the voice
 of a man  a familiar voice   
 rails 

 to whosoever shall find this immediate-
 ly on discovery carry to the offices of al-
 vin wentworth chairman of new york

city-state the remainder of this message is
translatable only by the means which he
alone possesses 

  there was a whirring click then

  chairman wentwordi i have not much
time in which to say all that i wish for at
any moment we may be detected in the act
of recording this by those who are our
captors  so i will be brief   

  in the first place i john rail wish to
state that upon me alone rests the blame for
the fate which we know will soon be upon
the world it was i who heedless of the
warnings of one infinitely wiser than my-
self insisted on continuing our ill-fated ex-
periments with a power inconceivably too
great for the tamperings of man

  the result we know only too well for
us imprisonment and later an unimagin-
able death for the world-destruction  

  my friend arnold hend was unhap-
pily justified in his fear that the gigantic
light-bender which we constructed in the
interior of the peace tower would warp
the matter that came into its scope as well
as the light 

  when we rendered the tower invisible
we unknowingly translated it into another
dimensional plane  it was not long be-
fore we-we came in contact with the inhabi-
tants of that plane within twenty-four
hours we were in their hands   

  there is no word in our language to
describe those who are our captors noth-
ing in our experience with which to compare
them    they are simply-monsters 

  but their intelligence is gigantic they
had no difficulty in grasping the principle
of the light-bender or in accepting the fact
of the existence of another world-plane
 and they have determined by the
use of our light-bender to invade our
world   

  they build with inconceivable rapidity
for days they have been engrossed with the
building of the machine by which they
hope to translate new york and later oth-
ers of our cities into their own plane where
they will have them at their mercy   
and they are ignorant of the meaning of
mercy 

  their machine is nearly finished des-
the light bender



pite the immensity of its size and the com-
plexity of its equipment and apparently
with a species of sadistic humor they plan
to-to drag new york under on the very
same day that we had planned to again
make visible the tower   

  for several nights we have attempted to
communicate with you councillor at first
wt thought that perhaps some engine of
man could avail against these    and
wt have nearly been successful for in some
places the wall between the worlds has
been worn very thin by their constant ex-
periments with the bender   

  but we have failed to you what con-
ceivable meaning could the strange antics
of shadows hold    none and we
have given up all thought that anything
little man could do would have any effect
upon the balance    there remains to
us one only one slight hope that hope
lies in the incalculable power of the light-
bender

  it is our belief that if on any occasion
the full force of the bender is used by the
monsters in maintaining their position in
our dimension or if the power is held on
for any appreciable length of time not only
will the atoms of their machine be warped
but they will be completely disrupted jrom
their orbits 

  in such a case we realize that both of us
are doomed to an inconceivable death but
even that will scarce make reparation for
the unspeakable horror which we have
loosed upon the world 

  the message came to an abrupt end evi-
dently it had been interrupted   

  wentworth sat motionless for a long time
a silence settled over the room   

  it was dark when he took the battered
little cylinder into his hand and went with
it to the small round door of a wall safe

  lie opened the door with a careful mo-
tion he slid the cylinder gently into the
wall

  then he took up the radiophone

  washington    any news

  the answer came faintly back over the
ether

  none

  he prepared himself for a long period of
waiting he took the little phone into his
bedroom and set it on a small table beside
his bed he arranged the automatic alarm
and at last with a weariness born of men-
tal and physical exhaustion he threw him-
self upon the bed   

  he waited many days-in vain and af-
ter a time the rescuers broke through
crumpled metal that had yielded to the ben-
der and he went back once more to the
world of men   

  he was destined to wait a long time

	 

  for the days and the months swung past
and grew into years and still there was no
news that is if one except the whispered
story of a german tramp steamer in mid-
atlantic that had come upon at dawn of
the day following the last visit a vast sec-
tion of boiling sea in which seemed sinking
a gigantic dark mass   

  the short memory of the world forgot
quickly the menace of darkness that had
so nearly obliterated it and the affairs of
men went on in their accustomed way   

  but at times the chairman of the council
of new york city-state will lock himself
up in a little room high in an ancient build-
ing and run his fingers once more over the
two cylinders and gaze with a vague fear
at the paperweight and the drum which he
does not touch

  and there are some who wonder and are
curious as to the reason that the councillor
ordered the building of two mighty sta-
tues in bronze and the placing of them in
a great way of the lower canyons

important things to think of than two dust-

  the news line speaker droned on mechan-
ically until fran plugged in the teletype re-
ceiver he depressed a little button marked
start

  well acre its going to be too late to
call mars pretty soon anything coming
in here will have to
be boosted over to
honolulu he yawn-
ed widely stretching
his slender but lithe
arras high he scratch-
ed the back of his head
absently

  yeah the other
said and yawned be-
cause he couldnt help
himself he glanced
at the big electric
clock on the wall

two oclock just
about time for venus
to be peeking over the
hills think ill make
this the last item its
almost press time for
them in vel deur any-
way

  the big heliograph
chattered high above
the building on its
steel tripod blinking
its intense violet eye at
the dimming red pin
point of mars above
everything else around
it the small stone
building squatted firm-
ly to the top of stone
mountain a very im-
portant nerve center
for interplanetary communication here
was received the news from all over the
earth to be flashed to venus and mars
when they were in favorable position

  acre sat in his chair before the big key-
board of the helio his nimble fingers fly-
ing over the keys and his eyes roving over
the news item before him

  well there  for the boys at vel deur

 guess wed better let er cool off for awhile
 before wg call kraupuk venus eh he
 said leaning back with his hands clasped
 behind his head

 yeah better do that and keep that water
 cooler running in the meantime got a lot
 of messages piled up here for kraupuk
 fran advised he went to the big control
 panel and shut off
 the intense blinding
 arc of the helio

                   fran hammond was
                 a young university
                 student on vacation
                 and though his father
                 was president of ham-
                 mond interplanetary
                 communications ltd
                 he had worked his way
                 through school during
                 vacations by operating
                 in the helio stations of
                 the company he was
                 a healthy glowing
                 type of youth and
                 loved the glamor and
                 excitement of inter-
                 planetary communica-
                 tion his sole com-
                 panion acre was an
                 older man chief of the

                          better tell frisco to
                        shoot everything for
                        mars over to honolu-

                        getting too low dont
                        take anything-check
                        em back

                      fran sat down at a
 small microphone and pressed a button in
 a moment there was an answering buzz

   hello fritz better switch over to hon-
 olulu now were through with vel deur
 ive got a few items from there ill send in
 to you on no h

   oke fran came fritzs voice through
 the resonant speaker

fran stepped over to a spindle and took

f jjnconsciously be-
 u fore our very eyes a
 revolution in business has
 been going on by the in-
 vention of new communica-
 tion devices not only is it
 possible to send photo-
 graphs by telegraph and
 radio but also a mans
 signature or a legal docu-
 ment all that is needed
 to complete this picture is
 the perfection of television
 by that means four men in
 four different parts of the
 country can sit at their own
 desks and draw up a con-
 tract or a teacher can hold
 a class for students in all
 parts of the country or
  treaties between nations can
 be drawn up without any
 envoy being obliged to
 leave his country

    these wonders are well
  on the way to perfection
  and there is no doubt but
  that they will change our
  whole lives radically they
  will introduce new com-
  plexities into our exist-
  ence new conflict and new
  thrills some of these con-
  flicts mr stangland gives
  us in his fast moving story

wonder stories

down a reel of perforated tape he placed
it in a multiplex transmitter and immedi-
ately there began a high speed clicking sound
from the machine in the room was a num-
ber of complex machines several receivers
that looked like overgrown typewriters and
several high speed transmitters for relay-
ing messages from the helio stations on
venus and mars

  these messages were received by the elec-
tric eye of a highpower telescope and trans-
formed into electric impulses for the multi-
plex receiver in an adjoining room were
humming motors and big fat transformers
that sang a deep song of tireless work all
day and night a straight and trim brown-
skinned figure fran
stood before the high-
panelled window looking
east enjoying the sharp
clear outlines of the
mountains in the early
morning

  it was several hours
before sunrise in the
crystal sparkling atmos-
phere of the high altitude
the stars scintillated like
a myriad of tiny polished
jewels some were red
and white and others ap-
peared to be revolving
slowly flashing purple
red and greenish-violet
from a thousand facets

outside a crisp breeze
swept up from the valley below and whis-
tled about the corners of the lone squat
building over the rim of the world a
brilliant sparkling planet rose impercepti-
bly ascending into the blue-black sky fran
felt a thrill in his heart every time he wit-
nessed the glory of the rising of venus

  well there she is he announced turn-
ing to acre

  the latter stood behind fran and looked
at the silvery gleaming eye

  certainly a pretty sight eh he com-
mented he walked over to an instrument
that looked like a sextant guess ill take
a shot at her and get ready for work sig-

nals will be kind of distorted until she get
a bit higher

	he noted the angle and stepped over to
a hemisphere throwing on the power to
a motor that moved the big fiery eye of the
helio he traced a course in the sky for the
day and set it for slow motion locking the
instrument in place outside the huge
helio slowly turned like a mighty all-seeing
orb of a colossus and focussed itself on the
rising planet and then of a sudden bil-
lions of candlepower flashed out across mil-
lions of miles of empty space

  hope we can get them right away be-
cause well only have a few hours to oper-
ate before the sun gets too bright he told
fran seating himself be-
fore the keyboard of the
transmitting helio and
making a few tentative
pecks at the keys for ad-
justment

  stone mountain call-
ing kraupuk he typed
off as a preliminary to
two-way communication
with venus the immense
brilliant pupilled eye
hundreds of feet above
acre blinked rapidly

the chattering and
clicking ceased as
the two operators waited
tensely in the contrasting
silence for an answer
minutes passed 

  click-click click-click 

  at acres right hand the receiving tele-
type machine started to form intelligible
words on a tape

  kraupuk answering vvvv
have lots of messages for you unable to
get catskill station cloudy ready for
double communication

  acre inserted the perforator in the re-
ceiver and sealed its case

  all right fran let me have those items
on your hook here goes

  as soon as the light impulses travelling

the eyes of two worlds



at  miles per second had reached
the distant planet the room was filled with
a multitude of high frequency sounds of
speeding messages coming and going over
the nerve centers of two planets

  fran was busy with the frisco and new
york lines of the news co receiving mes-
sages and turning them over to acre and
in turn taking his messages to transmit to
the head offices there was news from every
corner of the earth political developments
of the past day reports disasters and    

   flash

      millions in interplanetary credit
    units were stolen today from the bank
    of italy member of the interplane-
    tary banking association numbers
    of the credit letters were evidently
    obtained from someone in the bank
    and were withdrawn by persons un-
    known the case resembles the one
    at kraupuk a year ago which has not
    yet been solved and it is hinted that
    an interplanetary league of criminals
    is back of the theft all interplane-
    tary association banks have been

  	warned

  well will you look at this acre fran
exclaimed showing the flash to the oper-
ator

  the flying fingers of acre stopped as he
paused to read the dispatch

  oh my aunt i wonder if they got my
million he cried in a high falsetto feign-
ing alarm

  theyd wait a long time for you to make
your first million so they could steal it
fran grinned then he sobered thats a
funny thing acre isnt it remember that
theft in kraupuk mentioned here they
did the same thing up there didnt they
took a cool million in credit units without
anyone knowing it wonder how they got
those numbers and then too before the
million could be drawn out finger prints
had to be taken i dont understand it

  yeah tis kind of funny at that think
ill send this flash right away it ought to
take precedence over the rest of this stuff
acre commented turning to his keys his
fingers itched to get going again he start-
ed the message

 bangcrash  crash 

  there was a sudden report followed by
the loud crash of collapsing glass and still

later the crackling reports of splintering
glass on the roof of the building the glar-
ing eye of the helio went out with a blind-
ing terrific flash and a crackling explo-
sion

  acre jumped to his feet overturning his
chair and sprang for the control board
there was a bright flash and a report as
several circuit breakers opened on the black
panel

  there they go fran cried pointing out
the window down the mountain side

  racing madly down the broad mountain
road a long low slung car sped in a black
streak her powerful lights flooding the
highway like day

  what in the world- acre began to-
tally surprised

  you stay here and get sacramento with
the televisor and warn everyone around this
country im going to follow em

  fran grabbed a small highpowered elec-
tric flash gun and made hurriedly for the
station garage here was kept a beautiful
sleek looking lynx for use of the station
one of the fastest diesel cars made and
capable of a top speed of  miles per hour
on the table smooth -foot concrete high-
ways the machine was made to pierce the
air like a falling drop of water broad and
massive in front and tapering down to a
small rear

  wind slid off its rounded glossy body
like water on an oily billiard ball the
faster the car went the safer it was for air
has properties of a solid at high speeds
striking its sloping nose with terrific force
and therefore creating a vector pointed
downward forcing the car to cling to the
road

the mad pursuit

opening the tiny door fran jumped
into the heavy cushioned seat and
pulled the transparent top cowling piece
shut with a slam making almost an air-
tight compartment he pressed a small but-
ton on the broad dashboard and immedi-
ately the car started forward under the silent
power of a giant battery upon reaching
twenty miles an hour the electric motor cut

out and fifty droning cylinders champing at
the bit let out a gargantuan roar as they
took up the momentum and sent five hun-
dred horsepower to the four massive wheels

   the great three-ton car leapt ahead eighty
miles an hour down the winding high bank-
ed road fran stared ahead into the dark
smiling grimly thrilling to the light touch
of his foot that controlled so much power
there was a sense of safety in the muffled
deep throated roar that streamed back from
under the long hood he peered into the
night ahead through the slanted windshield
that clove the air like an aerial torpedo no
sign of them yet he dared not increase the
speed for the centrifugal thrust indicator
already showed five miles in excess of
safety around the mountain curves a big
neon sign with three numbers on it came into
view as he thundered around a curve
speed limit 

  getting down into the valley he mum-
bled to himself and shoved the speedometer
to  but he was straining at the
tether  was too slow he could slow up
for the next curve with his big air brakes
the indicator made a rapid ascent to 
those signs anyway were for ordinary care-
ful drivers who didnt drive a lynx the
four fan-shaped exhausts protruding from
the tail of the car let out a high pitched
whistle as the huge car fled down the
straightaway with her giant engine emitting
a continuous deep bay like a bloodhound
close on the heels of his quarry

  down the raceway a mile fran saw the
red numbers standing out against a dark
background 

  seventy-five be hanged he said half
aloud to himself in the luxurious soft
gloom of his compartment i can take it
at eighty-five

  he looked out at the countryside stream-
ing by the car in different variegated streaks
of color overhead through the glass cov-
ering he could see the twinkling stars and
lower down was the brilliant white star of
venus what did the station at kraupuk
think stone mountain suddenly blind
hm

  the neon sign left a red-streaked impres-
sion in his eye as he flashed by it he still

  had a mile and half to the curve he
throttled down to ninety and took a grip on
the wide thin rimmed wheel as the curve
raced toward him eighty-five miles an
hour he entered on the left hand side
taking a terrible chance the centrifugal
needle immediately jumped to ten miles
and a little red light flashed above it max-
imum speed before turning over

  the broad heavy duty tread of the thick
tires sent up a deep singing cry of warning
in spite of his death grip on the steering
wheel fran could not hold the heavy car
low on the curve and with a panicky thump-
ing of his heart he watched it creep up to
the top closer and closer and as it came out
on to a long straightaway again the hub
of the right rear wheel carried away a thirty-
foot section of safety wire netting with an
ear splitting screech but he had made it
yet nevertheless at a price his legs seemed
to sag even while at rest and he brushed
away a bead of moisture on his brow

   however he must be getting along he told
himself hadnt seen hair nor hide of the
others on the long ten-mile stretch the
speedometer almost revealed  and then
as he rounded a wide long curve he started
at the sight of two tiny twinkling lights
miles away one was red and the other
green suddenly they both flashed a bright
red and then disappeared

  went into a curve fran thought

  a sign flashed by in a red streak 

  well that means three hundred for me
the sign shows the limit for most cars but
its not mine and his foot touched the
floor

        miles per
hour

   an excited grin spread over his face this
was the fastest hed ever gone in a surface
car things just streamed by in a hazy
kaleidoscope

  but he was more careful in rounding
curves after his sickening experience he
took the next one at a safe speed the mas-
sive low car swept around the wide curve
with a slight whining of tires at  miles
the brilliant flood lights of the car turned
with the front wheels and before he was
around the curve fran jammed at the big
the eyes of two worlds



  double air brake pedal with a cry of despair
spread across the road was a number of
fence posts taken from a pile at the side

the brakes took hold with a big sigh
and the car careened to the side would
he stop in time or run over the posts in-
evitably damaging the car beyond repair
and perhaps injuring himself fatally

  it was with positive relief that fran pull-
ed the emergency brake though he nearly
went through the glass and stopped the
skidding car several feet from the danger-
ous wood posts he climbed from the cock-
pit a bit shaky cursing the man or men
ahead with rapid work he cleared the road
and made for his seat again he smiled
grimly at two streaks of black behind his
car on the white pavement

  with a heavy roar the weighty car leapt
ahead down the highway guided by a very
determined hand at the wheel several miles
on fran made out the two lights again and
in the thirty-mile stretch across a small
desert he ate up the intervening distance to
the car ahead a half mile away the other
car suddenly took a little used road leading
back up into a lonely stretch of mountain
country

  a chance glance at his oil reserve drew
an oath from fran it was almost empty
for several fuming minutes he waited at the
cross roads oil station to take on  gallons
of fuel helplessly he watched the other
car rumbling up the road while he lost pre-
cious moments of hot pursuit

  all right charge that to hammond com-
munications he tossed to the attendant
and in a burst of roaring exhausts rolled out
of the station swiftly

  the road led ever upward in a desolate
thinly inhabited country  across raging
white foamed torrents and up steep rocky
grades the powerful lynx sped in relent-
less chase by now the sun had hoisted it-
self into the sky enough to suffuse the
mountainous region in a wonderous golden
glow it bathed the upper crags warmly
and skipped over the ravines still wet and
dripping with the heavy dew of night up-
on everything was a freshness as if dame

nature had just bathed the new born babe
of day

  fran was gaining slowly risking curves
and taking hair breadth chances to make up
the distance to the elusive car ahead

  who in the devil are they and where are
they going he puzzled to himself what
reason did they have for demolishing the
helio it was the first time he ever heard
of anyone destroying such an instrument

  coming to a sharp curve on a steep grade
he gave her the gun to maintain momentum
the droning motor answered with a blast
of power and swept around the curve like
a swooping hawk there in a cut between
two solid rock walls was a huge massive
boulder lying as if having just fallen down
onto the road from the cliff above too
late the heavy car bore down helplessly
upon the immovable rock the broad wheels
dug into the road desperately trying to grip
the loose macadam like a bear sliding down
a gravelled slope in the flash of a split
second it was over and the fleet shiny road
monster lay a crumpled twisted mass of
steel and broken glass immediately three
men came around the sharp curve behind
the boulder and ran for the smoking car

imprisoned

u  w hell be all right

       fran opened his eyes to stare at a
rough log ceiling for a moment his mind
seemed to be a blank then he recalled the
crash with a shudder and stirred to look
for the source of the voice a sudden shoot-
ing pain went through his back he winced

  thats all right fella youll be oke in
a little while a blue eyed man said bend-
ing over him fran noted they were a
steely blue that very likely could be frosty
on occasion

  where am i he asked blankly

  in a mountain cabin the other answered
cryptically now dont get too curious
just shut up

  nice chap fran mumbled to himself
as the man went out

  for awhile he lay still examining the
room from his cot it was a rustic hunt-
ing lodge belonging to some wealthy man


wonder stories

he concluded and evidently he was on the
second floor because he could hear voices
droning down below how his head ached
it felt as if it had been strapped tight to
a plank for days on end after an hour he
heard two men coming up steps somewhere

  one was the man of the blue eyes and the
other was an angular man with long hands
and fingers and a beaked nose

  whats your name the second man
asked point-blank

  fran hammond whats yours and
what am i doing here the operator re-
plied thinking of all kinds of questions he
wanted to ask

  hammond hammond of the inter-
planetary communications ltd the other
queried with increasing interest

  well my dads president of the com-
pany if thats what you mean but i want
to know where i am fran began to have
a sneaking suspicion at the appearance of a
sneer on the mans face

  so the man said slowly a slight note
of sarcasm in his voice a crafty gleam
came into his eyes and he turned to the
other man with him rolvaag you heard
what he said

  yes a hammond the man addressed
as rolvaag answered

  well what of it fran exclaimed

  we didnt realize we were racing with
such distinguished company the angular
man said mockingly permit me to intro-
duce myself you have the pleasure of be-
ing the guest of nicolle lorentz soldier of
fortune

  lorentz the racing fool fran cried

  not so much of a fool however the
other returned

  and youre the one then that destroyed
the helio the prostrate man exclaimed
aloud	

  we conveniently put it out of working
order lorentz smiled liking the euphem-
ism better

  dont you realize you are liable to exile
on phobos for life for tampering with inter-
planetary communication man youll be
hunted for life for this fran cried and
in the first place whats behind all this

  ah you are very direct my dear fellow

arent you i see no harm in telling you
since you have in a way earned that right to
know having come several hundred miles
hot on our trail you did well to tail the
racing fool so closely yet it takes a
lynx to follow a lynx well you see it
was to our advantage to prevent the trans-
mission of a certain message to kraupuk for
a certain time and if i understand the
heliograph code at all i might say we were
just in the nick of time do you follow me
crude tactics you used trying to stop
me from trailing you lorentz fran
sneered

  it was a rather large obstacle in the
pass and perhaps a bit crude i admit
but then-here you are lorentz shrugged
his angular shoulders

  well whatre you doing with me crip-
pled on your hands fran demanded

  ill have to admit myself we didnt
know at first it looked as though youd
have to be left here by yourself as there
was not room enough with you for a trip
to venus but your identity has changed
everything for us we shall not go to
venus at least not yet

  i see it all now youre the one re-
sponsible for the bank of italy robbery and
you were making a getaway when you
thought of the helio you fool you wont
get very far in this day and age fran re-
turned caustically

qttah by now those credit units have
xx been negotiated into the minor ex-
changes of the chinese provinces and never
will be found my simple lad lorentz
boasted

  nevertheless when you leave for venus
i shall be at large to give you away

  oh but my dear fellow we said we
might have to leave you here for lack of
room on board you forget we didnt men-
tion how we should leave you understand
that in these uninhabited parts of the high
altitudes many boulders come down onto
the roads and it would be simple to leave
you in your wrecked car down there and set
the scene for an unavoidable and fatal
crash
the eyes of two worlds



  you murderer fran cried out rising
from his cot with difficulty

  tush tush my headstrong youth what
is a life after all in the career of an aggres-
sive man lorentz exclaimed lightly

  you black hearted beggar fran al-
most yelled sitting up in excruciating pain

  rolvaag get him some quick nourish-
ment ordered lorentz and then to fran
itll take you the rest of the day to get the
use of your back and by-tomorrow morning
well be able to use you now dont be a
fool hammond be a good lad and well
find other means of handling this deal and
lorentz went out locking the heavy door

  until rolvaag returned fran pondered
in vain the use that lorentz could have for
him he felt uneasy at the matter-of-fact
threat he had so casually mentioned for a
man so used to evading the law as the
racing fool never did things haphazardly
even though he took chances and yet
and yet fran thought there is always the
fatal slip-up that finally arises to damn the
cleverest of thieves

  he took the food brought to him it was
mainly liquids of the synthetic vegetable
bases and concentrates in small cubes even
if he wasnt immediately made well his
spirits rose with a filled stomach and an in-
vigorated system due to one of the light
liquids he was locked in the room and
after a bit he was able to sit up and flex his
muscles relieving himself of the constant
spinal pain

  he looked out the window and discovered
indeed that it was atwro-story lodge some-
where in a lonely spot in the mountains be-
low showing just the tip of its rear was
the massive lynx of lorentz

  he smiled grimly at the memory of the
pursuit and just beyond was the torpedo
outline of the space flyer that would be
leaving soon for venus carrying the crim-
inals away to evade the terrestrial police
and once on that planet they would hide
away in fastnesses of the polarian moun-
tains to wait for things to blow over then
a return to the chinese provinces to claim
their booty

  unless he did something to stop them
and yet lorentz had said they would not be

leaving for venus for awhile until he had
been used until he had been used ho
puzzled over that sentence tomorrow morn-
ing he was to be forced to be a party in
their nefarious work a tool in their hands

  there seemed to be a great deal of talk-
ing and working in the room below him
a third bass voice sometimes joined in the
conversations against a background of hum-
ming motors and clicking machinery for
awhile he listened intently trying hard to
distinguish intelligible sentences but the
noisy machinery made it impossible once
his interest and curiosity were piqued to
a high pitch when the deep foggy voice
cried out sharply

  dont be so impatient lorentz ill
have it set up by tomorrow in time

  fran sat on the edge of the bed resting
considering this remark but it was a fruit-
less game of guessing and he set about ex-
amining his prison by light exercising he
had been able to work out a great deal of
the soreness in his back he had got a
pretty badly wrenched spine in the wreck
evidently tip-toeing about the floor he
was disappointed to find the room barren
of everything it was approximately fif-
teen by twenty feet and if it had contain-
ed anything besides the bed it had been
moved out before he gained consciousness

  to save his strength he decided to sleep
for several hours impressing his subcon-
scious mind that he must awaken before
evening by then he would have saved up
strength enough to carry out some plan of
escape

at the needles point

hours passed while three men in the
room below labored over a low hum-
ming machine holding prolonged discus-
sions and heated arguments and in the
room above nature mended the bruised
body of the sleeping fran building up the
young athletic constitution to meet anew
the battles of existence

  there was a step at the door fran woke
up immediately nerves a-tingle it was
early evening and the stars were already
coming out in the gloom he saw the door


wonder stories

opening a cylindrical mercury-arc lamp
suspended from the ceiling snapped on

  ah been sleeping and resting like a good
little lad eh lorentz exclaimed facetious-
ly-

  i had to you scondrel i cant move
fran cried out feigning a wince as he lifted
his head

  what still on your back come come
man you must be able to sit up by now
get up and move around the angular
lorentz commanded with a puzzled frown
on his brown and he grabbed frans arm
to help him up

  the injured man cried out in pain and
showed all the facial expressions of excru-
ciating agony after a moment lorentz
stopped half unbelieving the condition of
the recumbent fran

  rolvaag he called at the door bring
the vibrator and sun lamp here

  and for several minutes the secretly
amused fran was given electric treatments
to banish the pains in his muscled back as
lorentz went out he turned to fran a men-
acing look in his face

  whether you can walk or not hammond
tomorrow morning you are going to assist
us a bit downstairs so make up your mind
to be able to get around

  he locked the door and went downstairs
fran waited in fear that the men below
would never stop to get sleep and rest he
sat on the bed listening intently to them
moving them about finally the humming
motors died down and the deep voice said
well lorentz lets get some sleep if
we got to go back to frisco tomorrow im
all in what with driving hard this morning
and setting up this cranky thing all day
it finally works though

  rolvaag evidently had gone to bed be-
fore the others for already fran could hear
his snores somewhere in the house the
lights were put out and after an hour he
crept over the floor to the window and
drew it up slowly throwing his foot over
the sill he let himself down easily to the
lower window sill and then dropped noise-
lessly to the ground he crouched for a
moment holding his breath and listening
not a sound

  immediately he started for the lynx

  no better take the ship he breathed
to himself stopping theyd get me from
the air if i didnt and maybe that road
is still blocked too much of a chance
hahway to the intricate space annihilator
a wonderful achievement of mankind fran
felt his heart leap as the entire court was
flooded with a blinding light and a voice
cried out halt where you are

  his spirit sagged within him no telling
what the madcap lorentz would do now
the three men came up from behind him
with wicked looking little needle-pointed
flash guns

  so the lad decided his back was good
enough to take him elsewhere tonight eh
the sharp-featured leader snarled but you
didnt fool the photocell my smart young
man

  he was handcuffed to an iron ring in the
middle of a big room for the rest of the
night in vain he attempted escape from
the cold iron clamp and finally he de-
cided to make the best of the situation by
getting a fitful snatch of sleep

	  

  come on up with you

  to fran it semed he had hardly closed
his eyes rolvaag had unlocked his shackles
and was standing over him it was early
morning	

  dont try anything funny now up with
you and into this room the cold blue-
eyed blonde jerked his tired body to stand-
ing and propelled him into a room filled
with a multitude of instruments and hum-
ming motors the third man with the bass
voice stood over a live televisor adjusting
it for synchronism lorentz called him
troen fran noted

  well had a refreshing nights rest i
hope the ironic lorentz smiled

  no and you know it fran said sul-
lenly see here lorentz what do you want
of me

cant help admiring your desire to
j know the stark truth in all matters
hammond the wily lorentz commented
but we shall tell you it is true that your
father has banking connections in portland
the eyes of two worlds



oregon at the columbia trust company and
at the old hanover bank in new york isnt
it

  yes but what good does that do you

  ah lots you see you are going to
call those banks on their television service
and transfer one million in credit units from
portland and two millions from new york
to the trust and savings at san francisco

  but that is impossible they would
suspect such a large movement of units to
frisco cried fran realizing the plan of
lorentz in full

  it is a well known fact that your father
transfers large amounts such as these to
other cities for the use of the interplanetary
communications company now when we
connect with portland you give the cashier
the correct numbers because if he reports
them as wrong you get a touch of the sear-
needle right here and lorentz drew out a
little barrel-like weapon and focussed it at
frans waist immediately there was a tiny
pencil ray shooting from it and fran twist-
ed in the grip of the other two men it
felt like a white hot needle pricking his
skin beads of nervous perspiration stood
out on his forehead

  i can make it hotter if i want to and
if i choose i can reduce you to a gibbering
idiot by aiming at the base of your brain

  fran looked about the room in hope of
some means of help or escape from this
madman he was helpless

  all right heres portland announced
troen who had been tuning the instrument

  dont forget now make a plausible ex-
cuse and transfer the stuff to the account
of one emanuel vincenes was lorentzs
final warning as fran was made to stand
before the rapidly clearing glass screen of
the televisor

  good morning greeted a cheerful face
on the screen it was the television service
cashier of the bank

  lorentz and the others stood to one side
out of range training the needle guns on
fran he felt their prickly pencil points
and knew that they could be more powerful
and terribly painful

  this is fran hammond mr bruce i
want to transfer a million credit units for

my father to the account of emanuel vin-
cenes in the trust and savings in frisco
fran said in a slightly nervous voice

  mr hammond everyone has been won-
dering where youve disappeared to-where

           o 

are your

  why-ah the pencil rays began to
burn i just got back to stone mountain
weve just placed an order for a new helio
projector and since dads gone off to south
africa it was up to me to transfer the money
for it

  weil i know your dad has let you place
some of these orders before just for the
business experience but a million credit
units thats quite a bit

  i know but ill take all responsibility
for this in dads absence fran almost
squirmed under the three hot rays

  well-all right then you sign a finger
print identification card to take to the bank
well transfer yours for verification give
me the number of the account bruce said
somewhat hesitantly

  just a moment til i fish the card out of
my pocket fran said here it is -
--oh oh i dropped it and he stoop-
ed to pick it up the rays came dangerous-
ly close to the base of his skull bruce look-
ed up from the pad upon which he was copy-
ing the combination of numbers fran fini-
ished the number and then looked into the
screen at bruce

  there was a new look in the mans face
the lines about his mouth were tighter and
his eyes looked intently at fran he wrote
something on a slip and gave it to a man

  what happened down there fran at the
station he asked and for a minute the
cashier engaged fran in conversation about
the wrecking of the helio

  the rays grew hot fran was talking too
long finally he broke connections with
the bank televisor

  you fool you talked too long lor-
entz blazed in a passion at him

  we better let new york go lorentz
troen admonished theyd be too much ex-
plaining to do

very reluctantly lorentz gave up the
slim chance of getting another two million

lust for battle he was leaping across the floor   

                                
the man who changed the future



lakorolis is a big town-a city of
over three million people as a mat-
ter of course it has its gangsters and super-
criminals most people have become used
to them but park helm threw down his tri-
bune with disgust at the monotonous head-
lines

  hows it ever going to end he ex-
claimed mobs in high-powered cars-
not even bothering to wear masks-carry
on their trade of mur-
der without fear of
punishment is there
no limit to what the
publicll stand

  the speaker was a
young man probably
not more than  or
 he was tall and
lean with the pur-
poseful look of a cru-
sader in his straight
ihin lips firm jaw
and deep-set dark eyes

his face was tanned
except the upper part
of his forehead and
from it the hair was
brushed back dark
and crisp

  professor nichol-
son smiled those
who knew his fame
were always surprised
when they first saw
nicholson he was
so young and in-
stead of being austere
and spare he was fat
and jolly he had a
magnificent bald head
curved eye-glasses that twinkled like rock
crystal and beautiful false teeth that denied
their own authenticity by their very perfec-
tion and here in the opulently equipped
laboratory of the university of lakopolis
he was far removed from the world of
gangsters so he smiled

  youre still on the citizens reform staff
arent you

  park helm darted a startled look around
  pipe down i pipe down he admonish-

 ed weve lost four of our men in the past
 month just because you know im on the
 staff you dont have to cry it to the world
 nicholson lost his smile

   that so he said soberly ive been
 working on something new lately and
 didnt read the papers i though the gang-
 men only killed one another

   theyll kill anybody that stands in their
 way so please dont be too careless when
 you talk

                      nicholson thought-
                    fully pulled out his
                    short calabash pipe
                    and set it going

                   yknow park i
                 wish youd kept up
                 your work here you
                 were the best man iti
                 my class i had a fel-
                 lowship all lined up
                 for you

                     but the young man
                   shook h i s head
                   theres bigger work
                   to do he said our
                   very existence as a
                   self-governing people
                   is at stake im in this
                   battle and im going
                   to stay in it

                      nicholson reminded
                    him casually

                  you remarked a
                while ago that youd
                like to know how its
                going to end

 that i certainly
 would park helm
 admitted it would
 give us something to
 go on then his grim young face relaxed
 in a smile as he remembered

   if you had your time equipoise ready--
 the one youve been working on all these
 years you could shoot me into the future
 say about the year  and i could have
 a look for myself

   the professor was not disturbed by this
 gentle raillery

   all right he said when do you want
 t go

    a s we struggle with our 
  daily problems and
  vexations it is probable
  that we wonder many
  times whether the future
  will hold as many tribula-
  tions as the present wheth-
  er in fact man is doomed
  to live out his racial exis-
  tence in unhappiness

    considering our present
  social life many prophets
  profess to see in the rise of
  gangdom and racketeering
  a threat at all law and or-
  der and that we will revert
  to feudal days when rob-
  ber barons held control of
  all highways and plunder-
  ed all passersby irrespec-
  tive of their station in life

   the threat offered by
  gangdom is even more dan-
  gerous when we find it us-
  ing all modern scientific
  weapons even before the
  forces of law and order use
  them mr starzl offers us
  an exciting prophecy of the
  future based on excellent
  logic and judgment 


wonder stories

  he got heavily to his feet and led the way
to another room where the apparatus al-
ready familiar in its general appearance to
park helm was set up it consisted essen-
tially of two enormous helices crossing each
other at right angles inside the vertical
helix was a cage of bakelite rods large
enough to admit a full grown person

  heavy cables led from the helices to enor-
mous motor-operated mercury jet switches

  you can hardly notice the difference
eh nicholson commented happily i
was right in principle all the time but the
capacity of my condensers was too small
i invented those he pointed to racks of
square glass jars covering one entire wall
i have here now- he
paused impressively-a
storage capacity of near-
ly a billion farads at
 volts

park looked dazed

yes sir nichol-
son insisted see those
generators twenty-
f i v e kilowatts rating
apiece and theyve been
running for weeks to
charge the condensers

theyre pretty well up
now the discharge os-
cillatory in nature will
be enormous but because
of its brevity will not
melt the coils you can
imagine the etheric strain where the fields
of those two coils meet any object in
there goes backward in time if the fields op-
pose and ahead into the future if they co-
operate the angle of incidence governs
now i believe you said  he turned
a handwheel and the horizontal helix tipped
until it was at an angle to the floor of
about  degrees

  guess thatll hit it within a year or two
ill leave it set that way and when i call
you back ill simply give you reversed pol-
arity out of the auxiliary condensers

  park helm was somewhat uncertain

  pardon me if i hesitate professor but
shouldnt i take a gun with me some money

and 

  no need for that nicholson interposed
cheerily your body wont go you know
that isnt quite safe as yet only a sort
of astral projection of yourself you can
see and hear but you will be invisible and
incapable of making a sound youll be
a ghost

  yeah i guess thats so a ghost for
good

  no danger at all nicholson assured
him i tried it yesterday with my switch-
es set for automatic return i hung around
julius caesar and my automatic switch
snatched me back just in time to make me
miss seeing julius get murdered

  park laughed nervous-
ly as he climbed up the
side of the vertical helix
and dropped down
through an opening into
the cage somehow i
cant believe it-it seems
so fantastic

  nicholson pressed the
button the switch mot-
ors leaped into life and
in a few seconds it was
all over the mach-
inery automatically set
itself to neutral the
body o f park helm
slumped to the floor of
the cage and nicholson
reached through the bars
to compose the limbs in
a more restful attitude

  no use letting the lad get all cramped
up while hes away he muttered

	 

  the one instant park helm was looking
through the bars with a slightly nervous
smile and the next he was standing in a
room that was strange to him he looked
at the calendar on the wall and noted that
it was august  he glanced down at
his feet and they were not there this gave
him somewhat of a shock and when he tried
to feel his body only to realize that he had
no body nor hands to feel it with he re-
ceived yet another shock then came the
reassuring thought of the confident profea-

the man who changed the future



or back in the laboratory and his promise
to bring him back at midnight about 
hours hence he looked around him

  he saw a girl she was gazing pensively
out of a window at the streets some thou-
sand feet or so below there was a vista
of cloud-piercing pyramidal buildings with
innumerable levels and ways for pedes-
trians and vehicles on every level spidery
thoroughfares that wound everywhere
through thin air with seemingly no support
carried swarms of humanity in bright col-
ors and restless activity overhead the sun
was often obscured by innumerable flying
machines it was a city such as the pro-
phets of science had dreamed of-this lako-
polis of  a city of sheer hugeness of
illimitable vistas almost of mystic beauty

   park helm never gave it a second glance
by merely wishing he found himself at the
girls side where he could drink in her
delicate beauty she was utterly uncon-
scious of his presence and continued to gaze
out of the window half wistfully-half im-
patiently

  her small perfect body was draped in a
garment that was vaguely reminiscent of the
greek influence-a shimmering light-blue
substance that was like silk but much finer
her profile was cameo-like and her skin
had the delicate golden tints of old ivory
her hair drawn tightly to her head like a
helmet and fixed low at the back of her
neck was golden too and so was her voice
she turned and spoke to someone in the
next room

  he said he was coming right in do
i you suppose they got him after all moth-
er her tones implied uneasiness and per-
haps a trace of shamed hope

  give him a little more time myra
 an older woman came to the door she
resembled her daughter in many ways save
that she was stouter and the hair on her
finely chiseled head was white she put a
thin white wrinkled hand to her forehead
and sighed

  its dreadful-dreadful- what are the
ktimes coming to

   the girl did not answer

  i remember it was like this when your

father was put on a spot just like this
he was doing some experimenting with
etheric waves and accidentally cut in on
one of angelos beams-

  it wasnt angelo mother the girl cor-
rected a little wearily it was spumoni
angelo wiped him and his gang out about
five years ago but it was spumoni who
put dad on the spot the tragedy oft re-
peated had long ceased to arouse emotion in
the girl she hardly remembered the big
kindly man who had been her father her
father who had been so unlucky as to cross
a gangster chieftains path

  i dont know how thisll all end the
older woman continued it was just like
this a man he had never seen before
called him on the televisor-told him sen-
tence had been passed your father went
to the police-it was right during a police
drive on the hoodlums-theyve dropped
that pretense anyway the police locked
your father in a cell where they said hed
be safe yet the next morning he was
found dead with an infrared burn on his
temple

  the girl turned and rushed to her moth-
ers side

  mother dont take on so she cried
youll have another of your spells

  i will say it the old woman persisted
with obstinacy of spoiled old age like
the angel of death-the angel of death
angelo reached him behind the prison
walls

  spumoni not angelo the girl correct-
ed mechanically and it was all done quite
naturally the assassin had entry to the
prison

  a soft chime sounded and the girl step-
ped over to it and peered into the teleplate
to see who was at the door immediately
she pressed the button to admit the caller

bought and paid for

park helm invisibly present in the
apartment took an immediate and in-
stinctive dislike to james burgess the mo-
ment that gentleman entered he was
dressed like all the men of that age in a


wonder stories

blouse of light flexible chain-mail and
trousers of the same material while a cap
of chain-mail with flaps that could be
drawn down to protect most of the face
covered his head park conjectured that
his clothing was to some extent at least
both bullet and ray proof

  burgess threw his cap off and park had
a chance to observe him better he bore
himself with a swagger which he had some
trouble maintaining he was about aver-
age height and slenderly built his com-
plexion was sallow rather dark his hair
black straight and coarse was combed back
sleekly he was handsome not more than
 or  and obviously a man who had
dene rather well in the world yet tonight
he had a furtive air-something for which
a man in his position might well be par-
doned for

  the old lady greeted him with a singular
mixture of eager welcome and reserve one
might think that he repelled her yet she
was obviously eager to please him and soli-
citous for his welfare

  james she gasped im so glad youre
still alive

  still alive and kicking he exclaimed
heartily looking speculatively at myra his
black eyes glittering and excited

  well have to tear out right away he
told the girl with a forced casual manner

  we myras hand flew to her heart in
an involuntary movement of protest

  her mother was almost joyful we can
be ready in half an hour she declared
you young folks can talk over your plans
while i pack

  burgess stopped her with a motion

  not you mother he said somewhat
awkwardly you can join us later

  you mean-you want to leave me here
at the mercy of angelo

  angelo wont hurt you burgess assured
her impatiently

  and then he wont hurt me either myra
submitted so ill stay here

  some of burgess studied urbanity drop-
ped from him he exclaimed harshly
say whats the idea you planning to
welch on me

  myras chin came up a trifle

i didnt know i was bound to you yet

she said coldly and the more i see of you
of late the less i want to be

you cant go back on him now her
mother interposed anxiously why hes-
burgess held up a warning hand and
when he addressed myra again it was with
suavity

  come my girl you used to like me
now that we could leave this place forever
and be safe always why turn we can go
to panama buenos ayres paris or vienna
the world is ours-all but lakopolis i
have accounts at half a dozen european
banks-trust me to see this coming for a
long time now my amphibian helicopter
is waiting at the lake front we can get in
and away before morning he turned to
the mother with a smile

  its only natural for a young girl to feel
like that she will change she will live
like a queen

  my life is my own i will not go with
you

  park helm hanging invisibly at her side
exulted

  burgess stared at her a long moment in
silence

  suppose you got the idea somehow that
youre too good for me

  myra met his gaze defiantly

  not necessarily she said at last but
i have reasons to believe that you were one
of angelos men until you split with him
and thats why hes spotting you

  your father was spotted by the boss
whom angelo bumped mean to say your
father was one of the gang

  where does your money come from
then the girl exclaimed bravely suppres-
sing her tears

  myra myra the old lady scolded
youre shocking-youre-

  so my moneys tainted money eh
burgess sneered milady is too fine and
pure to have anything to do with me is
she well all right my money did come
from angelo-every cent of it know how
i got it

  no no dont tell her everything the
mother exclaimed pawing at him with her
fine white hands
the man who changed the future



  time she got wise burgess snarled
harshly yes i was angelos first man
 took care of his confidential business
handled his accounts and did whatever odd
jobs no one else could be trusted with
shocked eh burgess laughed with sar-
donic amusement

  myra had become pale loathing plainly
written on her face burgess took another
tack

  nice apartment you have here-high and
airy-cost five hundred a month the
dress you have on-nothing better or finer
in the world-the automatic servants-the
meals you eat every day-did you think
these things came from the air well
they didnt they were paid for by the
tainted money youre spouting about
didnt you ever wonder how your mother
was able to do you so well here-coming
from alittle cubicle on the west side to
this youve lived here for three years on
my money-ever since i saw you with that
cheap young mechanic at technical park
dont that mean anything to you why i
could have had you brought to me then and
there instead ive paid to bring out your
beauty-ive paid-

  myra forgive me the old woman
threw herself on the floor at the girls feet
i knew youd never have a chance she
wailed we were poor you deserved
the best i wanted you to marry well-
and common people cant afford to marry
any more here i thought youd have a
chance and mr burgess loaned-

  ah yes mr burgess loaned the mon-
ey myra exclaimed bitterly and i was
the collateral quietly she turned her
back and walked to the window presently
a tear splattered on the deep-tufted rug

to park helm the role of detached ob-
server was almost intolerable he
ached to take myras slight form in his
arms to comfort her he entertained no
doubt about his welcome already he
loved her-the irony of it-a girl almost
five generations removed from his own age
it seemed the simplest and most natural
thing that she should return his love but
myra looked through him at the hard glit-

ter of the city and burgess came up behind
her he did not touch her knowing that in
her present state of mind she would shrink
as from a venomous serpent

  be fair enough to give me a hearing
he begged his voice low and pleading again
dye know why i broke with angelo

  not waiting for an answer he went on
as i told you i was often commissioned
to carry out special jobs for angelo the
other night you were present at some char-
ity doings or other the society teleview
company contributed some flashes of the
party to the general news screen and i
happened to be with angelo as he was watch-
ing the screen by bad luck he saw you
and heard your voice-you are beautiful
i claimed i didnt know you when he asked
me but he had one of his secretaries check
up-

  wonderingly myra turned and looked at
him she had detected a tremor of real
emotion-of horror-in his voice

  he gave me an order burgess went
on in a lower tone to get you for his rest
farm

  myras startled eyes grew wide fear-
stricken many and furtive were the stor-
ies of that rest farm-ironically named
many women disappeared from lakopolis
each year to provide fuel for the unbridled
licentiousness of the gang chieftains mob

  he wanted you for himself burgess
went on in a still lower voice and i didnt
dare refuse he was impatient spies
immediately informed him that i was with-
drawing funds on deposit here you know
the rest and now dear- he tried a mom-
entary caress which she did not resist-
now dear you know how much i love
you i am driven to the ends of the earth
for love of you-must i go alone

  with a gesture of resignation she turned

  im bought and paid for i wont welch
on the bargain she stooped to the hud-
dled form of her mother

  never mind mother dear she whisper-
ed better this than the rest farm she
submitted to burgess embrace and listened
carefully to his instructions about the busi-
ness of escape

  burgess explained that his present where

abquts were unknown to angelo some time
ago he had discovered the secret of angelos
uncanny ability to know at any moment
where his men were a small radiocasting
plant run by the power of radium was built
into the angelo identification belt that all
members of the mob were required to wear
it was a simple matter for angelo to iden-
tify each member by the particular wave
harmonic emitted and to locate him by
means long unknown

  but burgess belt was in the side pocket
of a public dieselcab it would lead ange-

lo	a merry chase as the chauffeur plied his
trade

  meet me tonight at helicopter basin no
 was burgess parting instruction he
kissed the cold lips upturned to his and
hurried out to one of the numerous landing
stages a pimply faced youth who had
loitered nearby followed him quickly spoke
in a low voice into a pocket transmitter
as he walked leaped into an aerocab and
followed the twinkling helicopter blades of
burgess machine

the coward 

to park helm a great sadness had come
he was but a disembodied ghost in this
new fascinating and dangerous world the
past that body of his in professor nichol-
sons cage was not it did not exist-was
sunk in the depths of eternity a homeless
spirit he was obliged to stand by and see
the immolation of the girl he loved to the
heartless exigencies of an age that was crud-
er madder more corrosive by far than the
times that belonged to him

  and he would go back he was certain
of that at midnight professor nicholson
would reverse the polarity of the fields and
he would be jerked back to  and to san-
ity park hoped that midnight would come
before the whole sorry tragedy could be ful-
ly played out nothing as simple as going
away was possible the still stricken face
of myra held him as light holds a moth-
would hold him until the time-equipoise
tore him away

  it only he had his body he yearned
for its competence its athletic solidity he

pictured himself clad in the outmoded
clothing of  appearing suddenly before
the incredulous eyes of the girl he could
face with her the perils of her time with the
same crusading spirit with which he had
begun his work with the citizens reform
committee he wondered if it wouldnt
be possible to a supreme exertion of the
will to augment the effects of the time-
equipoise to bring his body to him-some-
thing after the manner of oriental mystics
who are said to perform deeds of preter-
natural scope by sheerwill power nichol-
son had said that the body could almost be
transported in time a little more per-
haps   

  though he willed with desperate urgency
he remained bodiless

	 

  lakopolis was bathed in ligbt the
black heavens above were studded with stars
and the thousands of aspiring towers of the
great city were flooded by the glare of in-
numerable ionic tubes but the helicopter
basins at the lake front were dark save for
occasional small ionic tubes among the
trees

  without conscious volition park helm
had come with myra in the dieselcar she
sank deeply into the soft cushions her lug-
gage about her feet and stared unseeingly
out of the window as the driver expertly
guided the machine through the labyrinth-
ine maze of aerial roads he was an expert
that driver besides attending to his car
in a masterly manner he found opportuni-
ties to make guarded low-voiced remarks
into the portable transmitter he took out
of his pocket

  arriving at the outer gate myra pro-
duced a key and let herself into the enclos-
ure through a high gate marked no 
you may leave the luggage just inside
here she told the driver wearily

  yes miss said the driver pocketing
his fare

  myra waited until the car had disappeared
around the curve the driver stopped the
car as soon as it was out of sight other
forms materialized out of the darkness
there was muttered conversation one of
the men chuckled amusedly

  with such small-talk they beguiled their
waiting until the light of burgess helicop-
ter floating out there in the basin flashed
on it was too far to see anything but the
watchers could use their imagination they
lay there in the shadowy park pleasantly
acrawl with cruel excitement

  park had seen myra walk into the trap
unsuspecting at the waters edge she was
met by burgess almost unrecognizable in
the darkness and he conveyed her in a
small skiff across the still water to where
the small wavelets slapped woodenly against
the hull of the flyer

  burgess was trembling with eagerness
and excitement he had distanced the fear
of death and was licking his lips with ama-
tory anticipation he picked up myras
unresisting form and carried her into the
darkened cabin she had stirred him as no
woman ever had he intended with reser-
vations to be true to her

  park helm raging desperately anxious
and impotent followed

  just then the light flashed on it re-
vealed angelo standing in the middle of
the cabin he smiled mockingly

  burgess was utterly ludicrous in his
fright he let myra fall to the floor
wide-eyed she stumbled toward the door

  but angelo held out a sinewy arm forced
her back pulled the door shut in his other
hand he held a short pistol-like weapon
with a barrel about an inch in diameter
instead of an opening at the end of the bar-
rel however there was a lens of black
glass

  angelo was handsome he was young
not more than  and his reputed excesses
had not left any mark on him taller than
the average height he might have been a
pirate from the historic spanish man or a
knight dressed in the chain armor of feudal
days his face dark and smooth was
amused his piercing black eyes were
twinkling but there was that in the curl of
his scornful lips that made burgess quake

but with the quick wit of one who had long
trod dangerous paths burgess grinned

     ome to take delivery eh chief
v cant say as i blame you he leer-
ed at myra but even his hardihood failed
him when he saw the look she gave him
beads of sweat formed on his swarthy face
which was tinged with underlying yellow

  oh you were bringing her to me
angelo asked politely stroking his little
sharp-pointed mustache

  yeah you see 

  did she know where shes going they
usually dont come so easy

  well you see 

  thats plenty angelos brows con-
tracted but his voice became pleasanter
-and more dangerous

  weve always been good pals eh bur-

    o 

gess

  fascinated burgess looked into the ophi-
dian eyes he managed to nod

  and as long as you played square with
me you did well eh burgess

  angelo went on not expecting an answer
you know what happens to traitors
wait wait i tell you the doomed
man screamed

  angelo smiled another tight-lipped smile
toying with the weapon a mere touch of
the thumb-button conveniently placed at the
side of the grip and burgess would be as if
a red-hot iron rod had passed through his
body

  what is it you want to say

  i cant fool you angelo burgess
whined but youve got her now youve
got what you wanted why not let me go
ill never come back to lakopolis again
she is your sweetheart angelo asked
softly curiously

  she was yes may there was hope af-
ter all she was but thats all right cant
let a woman come between pals

  this was to be your bridal night still
angelo wore that marveling smile

  yes the tiny droplets of moisture
were coalescing and running down off bur-
gess nose sure im for you first all
the time

  just how far would such touching devo-


wonder stories

tion go angelo pursued tenderly bring
her to me

  at the commaiid the cringing burgess
seized myras wrist with averted face he
led her to angelo and angelos arm went
around her

  i just wanted to see if it was true
angelo remarked still half incredulous
then he carelessly pointed his weapon at
his former lieutenant and pressed the but-
ton at the touch of the black ray bur-
gess collapsed

  park helm present in the little cabin but
utterly unable even to make his presence
known felt a lively sense of satisfaction
but this was immediately swept away by
disgust anger

  myra was clinging to angelo clinging
passionately her little face under its hel-
met of golden hair was flushed and amor-
ous she pressed her lithe body tightly to
the mailed figure of the gangster and her
golden voice was thrilling

  i go with you gladly angelo never
before have i known a real man

  disgust and sorrow filled park helm
yet he could not go away some unholy
fascination held him and so he watched
angelo quickly responsive strained myra
to him her white fingers fluttered here
there until they came to the holster of the
ray pistol in a moment she had the weap-
on wrenched herself away

  move one step she panted and youre
dead

  angelos surprise was complete appre-
ciative he thought he knew women but
this little girl oh well

  with a well-directed kick he struck the
ray pistol but myra did not drop it the
black ray flashed out and a red-hot spot
appeared instantaneously on angelos ar-
mored chest the chain mail was thicker
than the average however and the man did
not fall roaring in pain angelo jerked
the weapon out of the girls hand struck
her a brutal blow in the face

  castagleri kaponi hurwitz shouted
the gangster chief angrily the little hell-
cat he gritted when those gorillas get
through with her shell wish id killed her
now

  myra staggered to her feet and made fo
the cabin door angelo roughly seized her
burnished hair so that it became unloosened
and fell down over her shoulders he
knocked her to the floor and as a precau-
tion locked the safety latch

  coming came a faint call from the
waters edge myra lay prostrate moaning

  all at once park helm noticed the navi-
gating chronometer it was less than a
minute to midnight when he would be re-
called to  in an agony of protest he
watched to be recalled now when he
could never know how this nights terrible
business would end-the thought was al-
most more than he could bear the chrono-
meter seemed to race now there was only
 seconds left  seconds-now-now

park felt the floor under him he saw
self as he had been in the laboratory
that morning-no- years ago his
body had come to him and with it a fierce
and joyous lust for battle he was leaping
across the floor before he had even drawn
a breath planted a terrific left hook to
angelos jaw that shook his powerful body
to its innermost tough fibre

  angelo launched a kick at this uncanny
apparitions face park caught his heel
lifted it high and as angelo toppled
biought a powerful right smash to the jaw
this time angelo dropped groaning he
tugged at his ray pistol which he had thrust
carelessly into the holster now it was
caught

  he never got it out a gush of blood
curiously dark and burnt looking welled
out through the chain-mail where the red
hot spot had been and angelo gangster
died

  here myra do you know how to work
this thing park asked the gangsters
had arrived and were shouting for the door
to be opened and they were clambering
over the hull

  the girl leaped to the controls unquestion-
ingly and under her manipulation the craft
shot skyward it was a good ship and
some of the hoodlums when they were even-
tually shaken off fell for miles before their
bodies struck the water
the man who changed the future

r

  angelos death precipitated a bloody and
decimating battle among his followers for
the throne he had held it was an ideal mo-
ment for park helm that astounding but
unquestionably authentic visitor from the
past to lay his plans for the protective re-
organization of society before a group of
prominent and as yet untarnished citizens

  and it was inevitable that in due course
commissioner of public safety park helm
should win as his willing bride the golden
girl whom he had learned to love when he
was a ghost

  but park did not know for a long time
how his body had been translated to him at
the moment most ardently desired even-
tually he found the answer to this question
in a perfectly obvious manner he called
for the  files of the lakopolis newspa-
pers there on time-yellowed and brittle
paper he found the following item

   indictment quashed
states attorney byron nelson to-
day moved to quash the indictment
against professor e nicholson fam-
ous scientist charged with man-
slaughter in connection with the dis-
appearance of park helm special in-
vestigator for the citizens reform
committee mr nelson said in court
we have the professors own con-
fession that he forgot to reverse the
polarity of a device he calls his time-
equipoise and accidentally sent the
body of park helm out after helms
astral projection instead of bringing
said astral projection back

  without impugning the statement
of a scientist as eminent as professor
nicholson as it touches on a matter
of science i must say there is no
legal basis for the indictment park
helm did not die here in our time
for if he did we should have his body
and the corpus delicti and if he
died  years in the future as the
professor has indicated may be the
case i can find no legal precedent for
trying a man for a killing that will
not be done for another  years
therefore i respectfully pray the
court that the indictment be dis-
missed

      los angeles feb -the two air-
     men bert reid and jack simpkins
     who three days ago set out from
     grand central air terminal at glen-
     dale in an attempt to establish a new
     worlds altitude record have not yet
     been located the mysterious disap-
     pearance of the men and their air-
     plane a specially constructed ship of
     foreign design has caused wide com-
     ment in aviation circles up to the
     present no plausible explanation has
     been offered as to the flyers strange
     disappearance a wide search is be-
     ing made in an ef-
     fort to locate the
     flyers or some
     part of their ship
     which may offer
     a clue as to their
     probable fate

 the foregoing des-
patch represented all
the world knew about
the strange disappear-
ance of the altitude fly-
ers three days after
they had vanished into
the cloud-laden ky
above southern cali-
fornia the big plane
had carried fuel for
five hours in the air
enough to accomplish
what the flyers had set
out to do

 there was little
doubt in the minds of
the majority as to the
ships fate the fly-
ers had evidently lost
their bearings in the
clouds and crashed in-
to the mountains or
had been carried out
over the pacific by a
high altitude wind and
had fallen into the sea had the world but
known the altitude ships fate it would have
stood aghast but let bert reid pilot of the
ill-fated craft tell the story from the begin-
ning

  

the attempt that failed

the morning of january  dawned cold
    and cloudy at glendale airport but in

spite of the adverse weather conditions my
observer jack simpkins and i were deter-
mined to attempt the flight which we had so
long been planning

  its foolhardy to attempt it in such weath-
er insisted airport manager lane as we
wheeled our imposing looking biplane out
onto the field to warm up by the time
youre ready to return to the field those
clouds will have the place hidden from view

itll be impossible to
land

 i waved him away
impatiently we said
we would break the
worlds altitude record
today-and were go-
ing to do it i replied
with finality

  sure chimed in
simpkins what do
you think we are a
couple of chicken-
hearted butterflies
lane waved his
hands in despair no
no of course not
he replied in a tone of
utter hopelessness
only why be a fool
just to show youve got
the guts

  but the preparations
went on soon the big
engine was sputtering
and popping gradual-
ly settling down to a
steady drone as it
warmed up from out
of the west a heavy
bank of black clouds
were drifting swiftly
approaching the field lane again warned us
but could not dissuade us from our hazard-
ous adventure he turned and walked back
to his field office muttering to himself

  fifteen minutes later he was on hand to
issue a last warning against the swiftly ap-
proaching clouds and stiff wind however
he wished us luck and with a small group of
other flyers and officials watched us spiral
slowly out of sight

much discussion h a s
 been raised on the
 question of interplanetary
 travel of the way in which
 the first flight will take
 place and its consequences
 will it he made for adven-
 ture for pure science for
 exploration for greed or
 personal gain of some
 kind certainly at this
 date no one can answer the
 question it is to he hoped
 that the discovery of the
 secrets necessary to the
 space flight will not come
 first to those in whose
 hands it might prove to he
 a misapplied power even
 the scientist is at times
 blinded by his own zeal so
 that he utilizes his powers
 for what turn out to be evil
 ends

   mr vanny has written
 here a fascinating account
 of what the type of expedi-
 tion might be and how the
 consequences of it could
 pursue the space flyers for
 many years


wonder stories

  on board the big altitude plane which
simpkins and i had jocosely named the al-
ta all was going well the altimeter was
registering a steady climb which fifteen
minutes after the start of the flight totalled
nineteen thousand feet the ship was still
far from her ceiling but we had preferred
to carry ample fuel and take more time to
make the flight rather to force the ship and
the motor

  the minutes wore away off to the west
where we should have been able to see the
broad pacific lay an unbroken expanse of
clouds that were slowly moving inland to
engulf the valley below us

  do we go up-or down asked simp-
kins above the roar of the
engine

  up i replied

 and up we went up
and up went the alta our
goal set at  feet
one thousand feet beyond
the record held by the
great lemoine of france

  in the tightly-sealed
cabin simpkins and i
were now wearing oxygen
masks the atmosphere
at the level where we
now were flying about
thirty-five thousand feet
was too rare to provide
sufficient oxygen for
breathing the motor of
the alta was equipped
with a specially designed supercharger out-
side our snug little cabin the temperature
was approaching sixty degrees below zero

  and on and on flew the alta and her
determined crew at  feet we had
penetrated three cloud layers and were now
soaring through a sky suddenly darkened as
though night had fallen quickly over us all
about us we could plainly see the myriad
stars to me it seemed that we had entered
another world as we soared steadily upward

  suddenly simpkins pointed to the left

  look what is that

  i peered into the star-studded heavens
a group of lights were moving swiftly down-
ward from an even higher altitude and tow-

ard the alta

  looks like a lost cometm i said not
knowing how to explain the strange sight

  swiftly the thing approached

  comet nothing snorted simpkins its
some sort of a craft

  that cant be i insisted we are
higher now than any other human has ever
flown

  i tell you its a ship of some sort he
maintained stubbornly maybe-

but simpkins conjecture was never
made known without warning a long
narrow shaft of violet light penetrated the
darkness of the upper heavens falling direct-
ly upon the nose of the
alta the motor stopped
dead and the silence of
the upper air held sway
strangely enough the al-
titude craft had not start-
ed to descend instead as
we looked at her air speed
indicator we found her
speed was increasing
while her altimeter show-
ed no signs of falling
straight toward the
strange ship we were
speeding i struggled
with the controls gave her
full aileron threw the
rudder and elevators over
in an attempt to swing the
alta away from the oth-
ers path but it was in vain a collision
seemed inevitable we were almost upon
her

  jump i yelled

  in an instant the door of the cabin was
thrown open a moment later simpkins had
flung himself clear of the speeding craft
releasing the controls i sprang to follow
him but as i did so a back strap on my
chute became entangled with the door and
i felt my fall checked before it had actually
started i was held a helpless captive in
mid-air

  swiftly now the alta approached the
stranger but it did not strike for as the
two craft met the alta slid beneath the oth-

er i had a vision of a great black void
ip the belly of the monster then the alta
and her entangled pilot were swallowed up
in its black depths

  seconds passed i was suddenly dazzled
by a bright light and was aware of a sound
like metal doors being closed i looked
about me the alta lay at rest in a large
chamber resembling a hangar and then
hands grasped me and i was lowered to the
floor of the chamber

  a dozen peculiar little men were staring
at me even as i stared at them they were
small fellows not over four feet in height
rather slightly built human beings except
for their large eyes which were almost twice
the size of my own their military-cut hair
was black their features dark their uni-
forms of a beautiful royal blue trimmed
with scarlet while orange caps topped their
black hair in striking contrast

  and as i looked on one of them appar-
ently a leader stepped forward and motion-
ed me to follow him for a moment i
hesitated then tried to speak to him

 who are you i asked and why
have you brought me here

  but the little fellow only shook his head
and again beckoned me to follow him i
did so

  he led me through a doorway and down
a long narrow passage that contained a
glittering array of machinery behind us
followed two more of the little fellows and
for a minute i smiled at the strangeness of
it all i felt that i could destroy an army
of these puny men and yet there was
something distinctly business-like and sug-
gestive of power in their appearance

  pausing at the doorway the leader of the
party pressed a button a moment later the
portal swung open and i was ushered there-
in not a word was uttered by my captors
as they silently retreated and left me alone

  i looked about me i was in a severely
furnished room about ten feet square having
but a single port through which i could see
the starry heavens

  i wondered at the type of craft this must
be to so easily maintain such an altitude
i wondered where it must come from and
where it might be bound and i puzzled

over the strange little men then as i
looked again through the small window or
port in the side of my room i gasped in as-
tonishment

an unexpected sight

beyond me lay a giant half moon beau-
tiful and radiant in her splendid glory
-much larger than i had ever before seen
her except through powerful telescopes i
remembered that twice before i had been
fortunate enough to see the orb like this
through the great two hundred-inch tele-
scope at mount wilson and also through
the telescope of the lick observatory on
mount hamilton

  the moon was approaching with amazing
rapidity were these little men from the
moon that i knew to be impossible
the moon was a dead world devoid of at-
mosphere plant life everything necessary to
sustain life and with such varying tempera-
tures that it would be impossible to live on
itd surface

  still it grew larger and larger until the
entire heavens beyond my little window were
filled with the orb as one greatly inter-
ested in astronomy my interest in this sight
was intense i peered eagerly at the ap-
proaching surface we were apparently
swinging around now so that more and more
of the surface was becoming lighted now
the crescent was rapidly vanishing as the
moon approached more and more to the full

  i racked my brain to remember the fea-
tures of the orb near the south i recog-
nized the crater of tycho and the immense
oblong enclosure known as clavius which is
some one hundred forty miles in length and
the deepest formation of its kind on the
moon one peak on the east is said to reach
an altitude of twenty-four thousand feet
because of its situation and depth the sun
never is seen from some places in its inter-
ior

  as i looked i could see the far-reaching
shadows of colossal walls and peaks break-
ing the line of sunlight in jagged lines over
the entire lighted surface

  the giant craters of kepler and coper-
nicus stood out majestically as did the


wonder stories

ocean of storms the sea of clouds the
sea of serenity  the towering ridges of the
apennines and carpathian mountains off
toward the north was the caucasus moun-
tains and just east of them the alps whose
highest peak mont blanc is said to rise
to an elevation of fourteen thousand feet

  it was a beautiful spectacle as we ap-
proached closer and closer the sun bath-
ed the great alpine valley to the west
quickly climbed the rugged walls of the
mountains and shots its rays into the valley
beyond the mountains cast sharp rugged
shadows the absence of atmosphere omit-
ted any shading from light to dark caused
the surface to bcither intensely light or
plunged into stygian blackness

  the entire surface of the aged orb was
like this there was no skillful blending
of darkness with light each detail stood
out with a harsh intensity on the scarred and
furrowed dead world

  rapidly now were we approaching no
longer was the entire moon revealed but
only a portion of her silvery surface we
swung down over the alps the apennines
nd the carpathian range until now only
the crater of copernicus and the surround-
ing plain was revealed we could plainly
see the jagged peaks and the level plain
within all about her surface plains were
spattered as though from the discharge of
molten matter which had been ejected from
the interior when the world was formed

  not long afterward we dropped closer to
her immense surface flew under the shadow
of her lofty mountains and darkness shut
out further view from the wondrous specta-
cle

when the door of my prison was once
more flung open my original escort
entered and i was again ordered to follow
them i did so this time without protest

  once more i was led down long passage-
ways and as i turned at the end of one a
flurry of white rounded the corner and ran
full into me nearly knocking me over

  oh-i beg your pardon

  i had seen some strange sights since my
captivity aboard the strange craft but this
was most unexpected a beautiful blue-

eyed girl with closely cropped bobbed hair-
clad in english riding boots natty white
cord riding breeches and silk shirt stood
before me i found myself quite speechless
but she quickly took charge of the situation
turning to the little fellow who had taken
charge of the group she eyed him coldly i
what does this mean geeko she asked
severely

  the little fellow hung his head for a mo-
ment

  hurry prompted the girl

  he is a spy replied the little man and
i was completely surprised at his perfect
english

  a spy

  the little man called geeko nodded curt-
ly

  we discovered him in a space ship car
near the earth there was another but he
got away

  the girl paused for a moment that
will be all for the present geeko in the
meanwhile i will take care of him she
said nodding to me and i felt a breath of
relief the little fellow looked crestfallen
for a moment and then with a short salute
he and his companions walked away

  come said the girl to me and i follow-
ed her

 she led me back down the passage
through which i had just come and opening
another door bade me enter i presently
found myself in a room some twenty feet
square tastefullyfurnished

  the girl invited me to sit down and tak-
ing a chair opposite me asked my name

  bert reid i replied then added
from the earth

  the girl smiled so i had observed

i am phyllis stoddard also of the earth
or perhaps it would be more correct if i
were to say formerly of the earth

  i shook my head hopelessly

  this is all beyond me i told her i
yet am not sure but that i am quite mad--
or in the midst of a terrible nightmare

  it is all quite true replied phyllisj
god grant it were a dream

  what i cried you dont mean that
you too are a prisoner here

  she shook her head sadly
the exiles of venus



f

  a prisoner of promise she replied
but tell me first how you came to get
aboard the space rover i give you my
word i had nothing to do with it i did not
even know that you were aboard until just
now in the corridor

  as i looked into her frank blue eyes i
believed her and so for the next half hour
i told her my story leaving out no detail
when i had finished she only said

  i am sorry but there is only one thing
for me to do i must return you to earth
but first you must accept our hospitality
and muriel will be glad to see someone
from earth too

  muriel who is muriel

  my elder sister but you must have din-
ner with us then if muriel sees fit we
shall tell you our story i must ask you
to excuse me until then

  fcertaioly i replied

  and now continued phyllis we have
arrived at our base i will give geeko in-
structions and he will see that you are pro-
perly taken care of until dinner

an amazing tale

i bowed and she left me my head was
in a whirl from now on i would never
say that anything was impossible

  geeko led me from the car and as i step-
ped from the monster i found myself in a
gigantic cavern whose rock walls and tower-
ing ceiling seemed to have no limits the
space rover occupied but a small part of
the room yet it was all of five hundred feet
in length with a breadth of nearly two hun-
dred feet it resembled a great whale as it
lay at rest in its titanic hangar

  from somewhere came the low hum of
machinery and presently as my eyes became
accustomed to the brilliant illumination
within the cavern i could see that numerous
tunnels ran off this main room

  geeko led me to one of these and finally
to a room hewn from the solid rock though
its beautifully-decorated interior wall dis-
guised the fact

  here i made my toilet and tidied myself
as best i could after the days experience
an hour later geeko appeared again and

conducted me down a long rock-walled pas-
sage to smother doorway

  we entered an anti-room and passed
therefrom into a large dining room here
phyllis met me and turned immediately to
her sister muriel she too was clad in a
comfortable riding outfit but as i looked
at her i thought her the most beautiful crea-
ture i had ever cast my eyes upon her
hair was much darker than her sisters her
brown eyes and flashing teeth set in a per-
fectly moulded face her figure slender and
graceful

  make yourself at home aviator she
said to me cheerily it is good to see
someone from home you see they are few
and far between in the realms of outer
space

  i smiled at the girl and secretly admired
her spirit for beneath her bantering con-
versation i knew there was something more
serious than i could possibly guess

  if all space wanderers are as beautiful
as you and your sister they must be
scarce i replied

  she shook a warning finger at me
remember you are on the moon-not
the earth she laughed

  the dinner was excellent it was com-
pletely vegetarian-grown in specially pre-
pared gardens in this moon base beneath
the orbs surface when dinner was over
we retired to a small library here muriel
threw off her mask of joviality and became
serious	

  phyllis has told me your story she
began addressing me from what i have
observed i believe i can trust you

  j dont understand it all i admitted
frankly but you can depend upon me i
assure you that

  did you ever hear of the astronomer
professor max stoddard she asked

  certainly he is the man who disap-
peared nearly six years ago with his two
daughters-say you dont mean-phyllis
stoddard why-

  muriel smiled mirthlessly

  yes she repliedevenly we are pro-
fessor stoddards daughters

  i was speechless it was an astounding


wonder stories

revelation unbelievable yet i had the
living proof before me

  mr reid the girl went on daddy
had been working for years prior to his
disappearance on a space ship he had the
assistance of a young electrical engineer
alan starbuck whose faith in daddys in-
vention was unbounded when they had
perfected their plans they hired a crew of
mechanics to assist in the construction of
the machine

  but when dad finished it he had no crew
he could not induce the men who had built
it to become his companions alan was
the only man he had he could probably
have procured enough scientific men who
would have been eager to go but he needed
men who understood the main workings of
the car

  to show the men that he appreciated
their efforts in the construction of the space
rover daddy decided to give them a little
informal dinner on the ship there was
just daddy alan the five men who had
worked on the space car besides phyllis
and myself

cftxuring the course of the dinner dad-

  jl dy acted rather strangely but we
thought that he was tired from the long
hours of work on the space rover and ac-
cordingly gave it no serious thought

  but later in the evening the five work-
ers and alan became drowsy then i had
a strange premonition not long after-
ward it proved correct the six men were
able to keep awake no longer and lay
sprawled across the furniture asleep then
daddy came forward a terrible light in his
eyes

  quick he cried turning to us girls
carry them into the bunks we were ter-
rified by his strange actions but as we hesi-
tated he menaced us with a gun

   all my life ive planned this thing
he cried and now i wont have my plans
thwarted-not even by my own flesh and
blood

  well at the point of the gun we car-
ried the men to prepared bunks with our
help daddy managed to get the space rover

started into space and when the drugged
men finally came to their senses they were
thousands of miles away from the earth
they threatened to take the ship away from
father but he only laughed crazily and asked
them how they were going to navigate it
back to earth

  alan was helpless of course he could
navigate it but it mean the prosecution of
my father if he did so and on the other
hand father threatened him night and day

  and he went to the moon i gasped in
amazement

  the girl shook her head in the negative

  no not to the moon-to venus

  to venus

  yes that is really where the story be-
gins like a great many astronomers dad-
dy figured that there must be some form of
life existing on this planet so with his
space car perfected he determined to fnd
out we flew through space for days and
days and finally landed on venus there
we met these little people who are with me
now they were a friendly little race and
at once we took to them

  but they were harassed by a war-like
people from another part of the planet
daddy desired to help the little fellows gain
their own and accordingly assisted them to
make war on the tanarkans as they were
called but daddys dream of universal
venusian power for his little friends came
to a rude awakening the tanarkans won
war and took our friends into captivity and
slavery only a few escaped in the space
rover with daddy

  from then on he was a changed man
he lost his insane manner and became more
like his old self before the success of the
space rover we retreated to the moon
where we built this underground city we
found water beneath its surface and daddy
and the others constructed machines to gen-
erate oxygen to breathe there are two en-
trances to this city each protected with a
double door like the diving chamber of a
submarine

  daddys old aggressive self completely
vanished he had but one aim in life-to
win back for the venusians what he had lost
for them in his mad scheme

ffl

  and your father asked i where is
he now

  daddy is dead she replied quietly
his tomb is high up in the mountains that
surround copernicus his last wish was
that phyllis and i carry on the work where
he left on

  and alan starbuck you have him to
assist you

  alan starbuck was captured by the tan-
arks replied phyllis with a catch in her
voice and i knew that alan was the blue-
eyed girls sweetheart

  and so concluded muriel these peo-
ple are my people until i have helped re-
store to them the land that my father lost
whether i shall ever return to the earth i
dc not know the earthlings whom father
so forcibly carried away i returned two
years ago after they had trained my venus-
ians to operate the space rover

  and the power that drew the alta aboard
the space rover was also an invention of
your fathers i asked

  that was an invention of alans replied
muriel if anything should go wrong with
that ray we have no way of repairing it
it was called the magnetic ray by alan and
he told his secret to no one but daddy and
he left no information either verbal or
written in regard to it we have tried to
analyze it but without success so far

on to venus

ifct t is the most amazing story i have ever
 heard i replied as muriel explained
this and if it were not for the testimony
of my ears i should never believe a word
of it

  and i have but one thing to ask of you
she said	

  and what is that i asked wondering
that when i return you to earth you will
say nothing about this-for a while

  i smiled if i want to keep peoples
good opinion of me i replied i am afraid
i shall be forced to remain quiet no one
would ever believe my story people would
biand me as insane

  and when i return to earth ill bring
you a piece of venus for a souvenir she

laughed her old jovial mood momentarily
returning

  then you really mean to return to the
planet i asked

  it is the only thing to do it was dad-
dys dying request there was nothing
wrong with his sanity when he made it

  for a moment i stood swaying on the
blink of uncertainty

  do-you suppose-that you could make
rcom-for another member i asked rather
awkwardly

  why-i dont know do you mean that
you-

  yes ive no claims on earth there
is no reason why i should not remain miss-
ing for a while and you-well ive no
doubt of your capability-but you are und-
ertaking a big venture for a girl

  a broad smile slowly overspread her face

  and so you wish to go along to protect
little muriel she asked rather lightly

  i should like to go with you i replied
because i have a taste for adventure and-
well yes-because it is no venture for two
women from my earth to undertake alone

  the girl held out a slender hand

  its a go she said with decision

  i gripped the hand and then i knew
why i was willing to gamble my life with
this bewitching girl

	 

  the moon hung beneath us in a beautiful
silver crescent as we sped through space
toward the home of the exiled venusians
five years had passed since they had been
driven from their world by the mistake of
professor stoddard and the power of the
warring tanarks five years of suffering
five years of planning and now the last act
to bring about the fruition of two womens
dream

  i sat in the pilot house of the space rov-
er at the side of muriel and phyllis at
the controls were geeko and his lieutenant
neepo whom through patient hours of in-
struction the late professor stoddard had
made into expert space navigators

  quickly the space rover cut down the
abyss separating us from venus the
earth lay behind us in a great bronze ball
her continents outlined in sharp relief but


wonder stories

the speed of the space rover was terrific
and our own planet was soon diminishing
in size

  we covered the twenty-five million odd
miles between the moon and venus in two
weeks which gave the space rover the amaz-
ing speed of approximately seventy-five
thousand miles per hour

  as we approached the planet through the
half twilight caused by her dense atmos-
phere we could plainly see the city of tan-
ark through the powerful infra-red tele-
scopes that were part of the space rover
equipment the city lay in the midst of a
tropical forest enveloped in clouds and
well guarded by a high wall that surrounded
it on four sides and as we drew nearer
the venusians on board could hardly be
restrained from hurling themselves down
upon their enemies in open combat

slowly we descended the location
of the dreaded tanarkan prison at the
lower end of the city was no secret there
was not a venusian aboard who did not
know and fear that place the lights of the
space rover were either turned out or mask-
ed so that they were not visible from with-
out then a silent messenger of deliver-
ance she settled slowly into the forest about
a mile from the city wall and now i turn-
ed to muriel

  now i must leave you i said huskily
i must go into tanark-alone

  no-no she grasped my arms tightly
you cant go in there alone they would
kill you i wont let you

  my dear girl i said quietly do you
suppose for one minute that i shall unnec-
essarily expose myself to danger and
what would they do to the venusian prison-
ers-and alan-if we were to launch an
open attack

  but-alone isnt there some other
way-

  if there is a better way i shall be glad
to take it muriel i answered her but
i have been thinking out this thing since
we first sighted tanark i can see no other
way

  but you may never come back

  i smiled dryly but how about alan
starbuck five years in a stinking tan-
arkan prison if he isnt- i did not
finish she nodded her head she under-
stood phyllis was not with us and i was
glad for that she would never believe that
her alan was dead

  phyllis loves alan doesnt she i asked
muriel abruptly

  the girl looked up at me for a moment

  yes she replied slowly phil loves
alan

  then alan starbuck must be rescued
before the tanarkans know of our presence
that is imperative 

  but-you and-i bert you do care
for me dont you bert she cried clinging
tightly to me

  i took her in my arms no man has
ever loved a woman more than i love you
i told her fervently that is why i am so
anxious to bring alan back to phyllis
muriel my love for you makes me under-
stand how phil and alan feel

  as the space rover ascended once again
leaving me alone upon that lonely planet
i experienced a feeling akin to on who has
lost his last friend the semi-darkness and
heavy clouds with a threat of rain assisted
me materially as i darted through the heavy
undergrowth toward the city

  before i had gone a half mile i was drip-
ping wet from the heavy dew that lay on the
surrounding foliage the venusian forest
was not unlike the tropical forests on the
earth and i was ever on the lookout for
wild life that might endanger my life and
the success of my expedition

  at length i came within sight of the city
walls certainly now if ever i must be
cautious as i watched the form of a man
drifted slowly along over the wall and i
knelt in the underbrush in amazement the
tanarkans had invented some sort of a float-
ing suit by which the guards could patrol
above the walls of the city

  the city wall was constructed of great
slabs of rock and masonry-rough and un-
even moreover it was about thirty feet
high fifteen feet thick at the base tapering
to about five at the top if i could get the
chance i knew i could scale that wall ac-
the exiles of venus



ieording to the venusians the tanarkan pri-
son lay beyond this wall

  as i crouched there puzzling out a plan
by which to gain entrance it began to rain
slowly at first but increasing to a steady
down pour within fifteen minutes the
guards were not numerous now and watch-
ing my chance i made a run for the wall
feverishly i scaled its rough sides sprawled
across the top and looked toward the city
beyond there were many squat buildings
in a large square and these i took to be the
prisoners quarters of tanark without
delay i slipped down the inner side of the
wall

within the city

the storm had turned the twilight to
almost the darkness of night and many
lights shone about the city casting shadows
which i quickly used for temporary hiding
and as i lay in the shadow of a building
the guard passed slowly overhead i felt
the blood pounding against my temples but
he did not see me on the other hand i got
a much better view of his space suit as he
passed in front of the many lights

  they appeared to be of a metal entirely
enclosing the man save for a window panel
before his eyes which extended around the
head to the ears waist high at either hip
there was fitted a bulls eye glass which
seemed to be mounted on a socket joint so
as to give the lens a wide angle sweep the
suit seemed to fasten together in front with
a long hinge running down it by which to
swing it open what kept them aloft was
beyond my imagination

  presently i saw three of the little men
approaching the building by which i was
concealed and for a moment i felt that i
had been discovered but they passed over
it and came to earth on the other side
then carefully edging my way along the
side of the building i discovered two of the
tanarkans in front of it evidently on duty

  this was no doubt the guard house or
police headquarters the three who had
just descended must have just come off duty
they disappeared into the building the
other two followed through a window on

the shaded side of the building a light
streamed i made my way to this and peer-
ed within the building was composed of
two rooms i was looking into the rear one
there stood the three guards the other
two were in the front

  the three divested themselves of their
space suits and after placing them carefully
in one corner on what appeared to be a
rack they passed through the front room
and left the building and as i looked in
at the empty space suits a daring plan came
into my mind i examined the window of
the guard house and found it had evidently
not been made to resist entrance so a few
minutes later i found myself inside every
second i expected to be discovered by the
two men in the front room

  quickly i gathered up one of the suits
and started back for the window but as i
did so a footstep sounded at the doorway
wildly i looked about for some weapon
behind the bulls eye on either arm of the
space suit was a sinister looking trigger
ray guns instantly i grasped one and
swung behind the suit

  the tanarkan guard saw me and made
a rush forward but as he did so i squeez-
ed the triggers

  with a horribly contorted face he dropped
to the floor as my poorly directed ray cut
away one shoulder i was sickened at the
sight but desperately completed the work i
had started but not before the fellow had
uttered an outcry the other guard came
running into the guard house i did a bet-
ter job this time he dropped seared and
blackened without a sound had anyone
else but the guard in the front room heard
the first ones outcry i listened intently
for a minute and hearing nothing suspicious
left the building

  my next task was to find out how the suit
operated that i could not do so i cast
the thing aside and began to plan my next
move i wanted to go back and plunder
the building in hopes of finding a ray gun
detached from the space suits but it seem-
ed unwise and so carefully concealing my-
self in the shadows i crept carefully across
the square i knew it would be but a mat-
ter of a short time when the two bodies in


wonder stories

the guard house would be discovered that
would cause an uproar so i determined to
locate alan starbuck as quickly as possible

  there were hundreds of venusians impri-
soned here from building to building i
went then i thought of muriel and phyl-
lis and the thought of them gave me fresh
determination to succeed i had learned a
few words of the little venusians language
and now was the chance to make use of it

the battle of tanark

i slipped up to the back of one of the
ground cells and through the tiny window
called within in the language of our venus-
ian friends hello

  the effect was like an electric shock the
little fellow must have been one who had
been imprisoned since the coming of pro-
fessor stoddard for when he saw me he
was not in the least surprised that i was a
white man

  how good it is to see you he cried
the great earthling professor stoddard
promised to return to us

  the great earthling could not come i
told him but i came for him where is
the earthling who was left here

  he told me the building where alan star-
buck was held captive with a promise that
he should soon be free i went quickly to
locate alan carefully i searched the cells
from the tiny windows in back and at
last as i was beginning to think my venus-
ian friend might have been mistaken i
found him

  starbuck i hissed quiet now
dont give an alarm its a friend come to
help you a friend from the earth

  the man wheeled toward the window
wide-eyed

 help from the earth who are
you how did you get within the city
quiet i warned him again listen
starbuck weve got the space rover hov-
ering over the city now will these prison-
ers help us if we release them

  will they help just give them the
chance

  all right the guards dont suspect me
here i can easily overcome the one inside
this building then we can organize-

 yes hurry and professor stod

dard-

  is dead i replied

  but phyllis his daugher-

  she is aboard the space rover waiting
for you

  the man breathed a sigh of relief five
years in this tanarkan prison had left their
mark upon him

  i slipped quietly around to the entrance
only one man stood guard i had no weap-
on slipping cautiously up behind him my
fingers gripped his throat he was unable
to make an outcry a couple of whacks of his
head against the stone wall were sufficient
to quiet him an instant later i had the
keys to the cells and was releasing the pri-
soners

  it was dangerous work to overcome the
other guards without raising an alarm but
we accomplished it and in the meantime the
guards patrolled the wall ignorant of what
was taking place

  from one of the venusians we learned
how to operate the space suits of the tan-
arkans and alan and i each donned one
they were plentiful about the prison execu-
tive buildings

  watching our chance we rose quietly and
slipped unseen over the wall and into the
forest beyond quickly we sped over the
tree tops when we had cleared the city and
soon arrived upon the spot where i had ar-
ranged to meet the space rover

  there was no sight of her though it was
long past time for her to return to the spot
we carefully examined the ground where i
had disembarked there were fresh tracks
here distinctly impressed in the soggy
earth were the marks of the space rover s
gigantic landing skids all about them were
the imprints of many feet-tanarkan feet

  the space rover had fallen into the hands
of the enemy

  with heavy hearts we sped back toward
tanark we must locate the space rover
without delay cautiously maneuvering
about we came again to the wall where i had
first entered the city the place was in con-
fusion the mob of released venusians had
started to storm the city without awaiting
our aid in the space rover there was no
the exiles of venus



sight of our craft we moved swiftly on
and near the center of the city we found it
surrounded by a curious group

then as we descended among the tan-
arkans the mob from the prison broke
in upon them from all sides the slaughter
was terrible but it was our chance quick-
ly darting in alan and i stole aboard the
space rover there were several tanar-
kans aboard trying to force the crew into be-
traying the secrets of the car a few
squeezes on the triggers of our ray guns and
we were again in possession of the ship

  they disabled our magnetic ray cried
phyllis as we threw our suits to one side
and she flew into alans arms

  what of those venusians i cried point-
ing to the onrushing mob that was being
swept aside by the barrage from the tanar-
kan rays

  they wont stand in front of that long
replied we told them not to do such a
fool thing the ones who escape well res-
cue later get going i must fix this ray

  as the space rover swung away to the
surprise and consternation of the tanarkans
alan began to work feverishly over the var-
ious cells and circuits phyllis was ever at
his side

  as we swung away from the city the space
men from tanark followed us but only
for a short distance their speed could
never equal that of the space rover two
hours later we descended again on the city

  the battle of tanark will ever remain an
outstanding event in the history of venus
the giant space rover showed no mercy to
the cruel tanarkans with his powerful
magnetic ray alan starbuck literally picked
the tanarkans off the ground and dashed
them to death in the streets below they
were never able to get within range of the
big ship to bring their guns into play

  and so our venusian friends returned to
their own world geeko has been elected
president neepo is his aide and the
wondrous feast that was given in our honor
shall never be forgotten by us to our last
hour on earth

  a month later we departed from the plan-

the

et enroute to the moon it was the final
trip of the venusians to pick up those left
behind it meant final abandonment of the
moon city but before that we dropped
toward the disc that we knew to be our own
beloved planet-the earth

   at twenty-five thousand feet the trap door
 in the bottom opened and the long captive
 alta dropped from below her powerful
 motor roared farewell to the space rover as
 that proud monarch of the heavens turned
 back once more toward the long dead world
 far above us

    owe the space rover to them said
muriel in the close quarters of the alta
and besides it has brought enough trouble
to us the venusians need it more than we
do i want to forget that any other world
but our own beautiful earth exists i have
had enough of space flying and we all
agreed with her after all there is no place
like home

  the alta swooped downward with me at
the controls below us loomed the beauti-
ful san gabriel valley the mountains on
one side the sparkling pacific ocean on the
other and directly below us lay the air-
port from which we had departed but two
short months ago

   needless to say our story is given little
 credence but that concerns us little i
 need not say there is one who believes every
 word of it that is jack simpkins who
 jumped safely from the alta on that memor-
 able thirty-first of january and finally found
 his way back to civilization

   muriel and phyllis are at last enjoying
 their long delayed happiness together
 phyllis and alan muriel and i live hap-
 pily on our beautiful buena vista rancho
 among the hills of the carmel valley

   often we sit and gaze at that brilliant
 point of light in the heavens that was known
 by the ancients as the morning and evening
 star and which modern astronomers call
 the planet venus and we speak of our lit-
 tle friends and wonder if they are as happy
 as we are we sincerely hope so

   perhaps we shall meet them again in that
 mythical world that knows no strife and
 where all good abounds who knows

     utopia island

what has gone before

 l

an expedition of german scientists to study some
natural phenomena in islands of the pacific en-
counters a terrific storm at sea and finds it ship
being drawn toward a terrible reef but it reaches
the reef safely and finds a man there who introduces
himself as bob white and who welcomes them as
guests to santa scientia he explains that the ship
was drawn to the reef by remote control the scien-
tists are taken by undersea railway to a strange city
where they find themselves in elaborate hotel rooms
provided with every device for their comfort white
explains that some years ago a german scientist
alesius discovered under these islands a vast incan
treasure and turned the secret over to a mr cook
to imp for the benefit of humanity cook has bought
the island from the local government of puitu they
meet cook who explains that they are in a city of
the future where tremendous experiments are being
tried out in all lines of human endeavor he begs
the men to remain as guests and investigate what
they are doing	i

   the visitors investigate the city and find not only
beauty in the planning of it but also incredible feats
of engineering and scientific and medical skill that

evening they read the history of santa seventh and
how it was established as a place where men of science
might have freedom to work out their pet schemes for
promoting the general welfare of humanity

  cook had received the secret of the great incan
treasure under the island from alesius and five years
ago kidnapped a number of young german scientists
to help them build this city

  into this colony as a stowaway comes elsa dorn
young cousin of bob white who is chief assistant to
cook the head of santa scientia elsa is given the
job of caring for the mail of the colony the city
is now only partly buut and needs -many more capa-
ble technicians and workers to complete it so that it
may be the university of the world

  meanwhile on puitu the little nation that sold the
iguana inland to santa scientia unaware of the in-
can treasure the president ferreira is fighting his
enemies who seek to overthrow him his son don
joao bands together with conspirators to get the in-
can treasure whose existence they have learned of
from sam a negro who had hidden himself on the
island they plan to steal onto the island to capture
the treasure

now go on with the story

chapter xiii
a feminist movement

bob white was in his office thinking
for the first time in many days about
his cousin of whom he had heard nothing
since their first meeting guiltily he shook
his head and resolved to speak of her to
mr cook when he went to his chief in the
next few minutes as was his duty he did
not even know where elsa was or whether
she had been given a position

  he felt the more ashamed when there now
appeared in the glass plate over his desk
an announcement miss elsa dorn would
like to see you

  certainly

  he sent back the signal jumped up turn-
ed a few cranks and with decidedly mixed
feelings awaited the entrance of his cousin
good evening your excellency

  he passed over the slight mockery
good evening elsa are you well
all except for the knowledge that you
are a very neglectful cousin i am doing ex-
cellently thank you replied elsa

  have you already seen mr cook
right on the first day he was more
concerned about me than you i have a
position earn some ill-gotten gains and am
content except with you i have taken over
the care of the mail

  the deuce i see all right that i am
not an attentive cousin but if you knew
what this visit of the german scientists
means to us    

  you would see that i now have no time
to talk with a foolish cousin to say nothing
of bothering about her she thus com-
pleted his sentence and sat down while she
looked at him and laughed

  you must excuse my inattention at pre-
sent you see you are going to remain
here for quite awhile

  thank you for your permission your
excellency

  stop that nonsense

  what is nonsense it is a good thing
if a person regards life contentedly does
not get vexed at ungallant cousins and
takes ones fate into ones own hand
have you already done that here
of course besides caring for the mail
i have already a very important post
what sort

  i am at present-further advancement
of course not excluded-general secretary
of the womans club of santa scientia
think of that

  you do not need to look so funny in
this new capacity of mine i am now coming
to you officially

  as the envoy of the womans club
now bob laughed out loud

  yes indeed but please do not laugh


wonder stories

you see the womans club has determined
to take into its hands the question of the
admission of people and particularly of
women in consequence of my unanimous-
ly accepted proposals this plan has now
taken on a more definite form i intend to
save from destruction the work which you
have so excellently carried out

  very charming of you

 we are indeed
agreed that people in
fact men and women
must come here in
great numbers

  in principle yes

  then you will not
object to my having
racked my brains about
these matters since
i have given myself up
body and soul-do you
hear-as much as is
possible for me-to
this splendid city of
santa scientia i think
it my inevitable duty
to look after its future
in my own way

  she again put on a
half mocking half
serio-comic expression
and bob laughed

very kind of you but
i think you can safely
leave it to mr cook
and the rest of us

  oh no in real-
ity it is only we wo-
men who have good
ideas

  see here white
began angrily

  i already have a plan

  then fire away

  i do not intend to time is money
why shall i say the same thing twice since
i now have an appointment with mr cook
i just wanted to be more cousinly than you
and tell you beforehand especially since i
am now a sort of feminine imperial chan-
cellor of isabella

 that does- bob could not con-
 v v tinue for again the glass plate
 lighted up mr white and miss dorn
 are expected by the chief

   elsa curtsied mockingly see and
 miss dorn

   while the cousins were on their way to
 cooks office the latter was sitting at his
 desk with mrs helling opposite him

                   what do you wish of
                   me he asked her
                   politely

                      i must speak with
                    you

                     yes

                     we have founded a
                   club

                 good the na-
               tional womans club
               of santa isabella
               quite right espec-
               ially if you leave out
               that really superfluous
               smile tilings are not
               progressing as you ex-
               pect now we are al-
               most a thousand peo-
               ple here among us-
               counting miss dorn--
               thirty-seven women
               the only marriageable
               girl in santa isabella
               is miss dorn

                       the deuce she has
                    plenty to choose
                    from

                    mrs helling paid
 no attention to this
 remark then men
 are not content af-
 ter all nature is such
 that men and women
 belong together you know that requests
 are continually being made by the workers
 to be allowed to return home

   it cannot be permitted at present

   i know but things cannot continue as
 they are we have formed a club whose
 purpose is the immigration of eligible wo-
 men into santa isabella

   do you want to do the way the mora-

flu e come now to the
  y conclusion of this
  masterly novel the first
  installment has been but an
  introduction to the strange
  island of scientific wonders
  where dreams come true
  now we come to the smash-
  ing finish in which the
  hates of the envious the
  greedy and the destroyers
  are massed against our lit-
  tle colony

    mr von hanstein is not
  satisfied to picture only
  daring instruments of
  science that may transform
  our social and industrial
  life he transforms sport
  and play also the sport
  festival of santa scientia
  is a triumph of imagina-
  tion and the ability to put
  great and stirring events
  into words

    if science wishes for an
  answer to its deepest prob-
  lemt how it can work to
  benefit humanity without
  being involved in the two
  deadly things politics and

vians used to get in women and marry by
drawing lots

  of course not

  what then

  that must be discussed there are pro-
bably many among the workers who left
fiancees at home

  it is questionable whether these would
suit our basic law of selection in physical
and intellectual respects

a state of bachelors dies out let prof
weigand prolong life as much as he wants
cook paced back and forth a few times
then he stopped before mrs helling you
are a brave woman

  why do you call me brave

  because you have ex-
pressed what we others
have certainly thought
for a long time it is the
hardest problem w e
have

  that is why we wo-
men ask to be allowed to
discuss it with the men

  of course you may

  then might i ask you
to listen to miss elsa
dorn also she will put
before you some propos-
als which we have dis-
cussed together miss
dorn has in fact been
unanimously elected sec-
retary and executive offi-
cer of the national wo-
mans club of santa scientia

  see here we seem to have caught a
tartar  the young lady has been here only
three days so far as i recall fcnd here she
already is one of the revolutionists

  on the contrary she is heart and soul
in our work but she comes right from the
great world which we have almost forgotten
already your plans are noble what you
seek to do is magnificent but with all the
machines we cannot forget that we are peo-
ple who have to be treated as such

  great little mrs helling has changed
and become the opposition party but here
come the two cousins my dear white it
seems to me that your relative is a very

dangerous person

  even the sight of cook did not intimi-
date elsa on the contrary you will be
grateful to me to me and to the whole club
well what great plans have you mrs
helling has already explained to me that
you think immigration of women necessary
and i must admit that this idea has long
been much on my mind only all this is
very dubious and i should not want to set-
tle these questions before having spoken
to the scholars who are now giving us a sort
of examination

  what do men understand about it we
are agreed that there should be women also
at santa scientia are we not

  yes indeed

  very well we are
further agreed that we
cannot take the first com-
ers but only a choice of
the best people
certainly

  we women are furth-
ermore of the opinion
that santa scientia only
can accomplish its pur-
pose by means of a great
deed which will make the
whole world take notice
do you know of such
a deed

  of course if that all
there is to it

  then speak please

the age of sport

ixte live in the age of sport it is
  quite clear that only such persons
belong here as have without yielding to
senseless extremes toughened their bodies
in athletics

  quite right

then we will open up santa scientia
with a gigantic athletic festival with a meet-
ing of the champions in all healthy sports
not bad cook shook his head appre-
ciatively

  but that is not enough

  no

  it is no use to have here simple contests

otfrid von hanstein


wonder stories

such as one sees also in berlin and frisco
with your ideas you have revolutionized the
world and have carried out what the boldest
scientists have hitherto dreamed of as uto-
pias

  not i alone

  only a fool is modest you have car-
ried out the work of prof alesius and have
found the right men in your friends you
are the soul of all

  you are forgetting your cousin bob
not heeding this elsa went on now
you must put sport also on a very different
plane the simple human strength which
is used in sport ought to be increased by
you through technical aids to what is super-
human with your fellow workers you
must study every type of sport the mot-
orist must become a flier the swimmer a
person who masters his element in an un-
dreamed of fashion all this can be dftne
if one wants to do it that is the problem

  think it over and have olympic games
in which you show humanity that giants
are battling here then invite the whole
world put out huge advertisements
make me who have studied such things in
america your advertising agent i wager
that a hundred thousand guests would come
at once your task will be to amaze these
guests with technical marvels

  elsa dorn was silent bob white was
greatly enthusiastic and mr cook showed
a serious face what you say is not fool-
ish but has excellent possibilities we will
discuss it it is hard to make people en-
thusiastic about scientific novelties but if
wc first get the people here by this let us
simply say bluff then they will also have
eyes and ears for everything else

  at any rate my dear white i ask you
to discuss this with your friends i mean
our old fellow workers mrs helling and
above all miss dorn i thank you very much
we must set about it so far as possible this
very day so that when we have a talk with
the new gentlemen tomorrow or next day
we can make very definite and tangible pro-
posals to them i thank you again dear
white use the evening to get things going
the three left the room wtien outside

elsa executed a grand pirouette well
how am i getting along

  fine if only it can all be realized
bob was still not entirely free from doubt

  while the two ladies went away bob
looked up the visitors who were now as-
sembled after the days work at dinner in
the so-called casino there he put the new
plans before them

  at once romer chimed in you know
that grotefendt has invented a most remark-
able new auto and i myself have a very
unique idea about revolutionizing swimming
races if vetter will help me out

  vetter nodded

 we could also make a mechanical
change in gymnastics without lessening the
value of it as athletic performance

  the swiss engineer at once put in a word
i have always had ideas about this we
must erect a stadium then we could add
electrical propulsion to soccer gentlemen
i am enthusiastic it is a fine idea

  of course it must remain sport

what is sport good sport is the devel-
opment of the physical ability and the
chance to prove personal courage that
shall be permitted in the fullest measure
then to work gentlemen

  did you originate this idea white
no unfortunately it was my cousin el-
sa dorn

  while the gentlemen were parting not to
sleep of course but to attack the new prob-
lems with all their might elsa dorn had
reached her room she felt extremely hap-
py for she was aware that cook took her
seriously and in this hour she felt akin to
the creative men   

the assistant engineer otto muller who
was on watch at cabo martino received
a message from an approaching airship
another stowaway on board

  another girl

  this time it is certainly a man he had
hidden himself carefully was only found
long after leaving frisco unfortunately
he got by the guards

  is he a bad specimen

  on the contrary he makes a very good
impression he is a scotch-american
utopia island



  land somewhere and leave him

  i cannot he claims to be a nephew of
mr moller his name is macgonnor and
the fact is that the late mrs moller was
named macgonnor he claims he vainly
looked for his uncle in frisco

  moller was here but he has already left
again

the man claims to have led an adven-
turous life was long in java claims to
have heard accidentally of his uncle and-
then bring the man along and let me see
him decided the engineer

chapter xiv
waiting

the airship landed in a short time a
sinewy and determined looking young
man was standing before the engineer
what is your name

  macgonnor my mother was the sister
of mrs moller

  the stranger was brought to isabella und-
er secure guard by the engineer himself
macgonnor was self-possessed and in no way
showed that he was inwardly delighted by
his successful ruse his papers which he
had procured in frisco were in perfect or-
der

  bob white himself brought the stranger
to mr cook there macgonnor presented
a few letters that purported to be from mol-
ler himself of course they were forgeries
but they were so skillful that they deceived
cook completely

  remain here and consider yourself our
guest mr moller has gone to yokohama
and will be back in about a week then he
can decide himself what to do with you
cook had become more generous since
he had determined to open soon the block-
ade of the rest of the world macgonnor
was given a room in the so-called hotel
a part of the central building indeed not far
from that of elsa dorn since he was here
with cooks permission and since there was
no restriction established as to his move-
ments no one observed that he used the
evening hours for looking around in the fairy
city and taking long walks

  the same evening when bob white again
telephoned alesia in order to inquire about
the german scientists they expressed the
wish to be allowed to remain here two days
longer we have so much to discuss and
we should like to come with definite pro-
posals

  bob and cook were very well satisfied
with this in the meantime it wotrid give
the other scientists time to think out the
possibilities of the athletic festival more
exactly

	 

  in puitu the conspirators had been as-
sembled by don joao

  tonight we set out we have word from
macgonnor he arrived safely in the city
of our enemies and is waiting for us i
have hired a swift yacht which is anchored
a few miles south of the harbor if we set
out early enough we can be at the island of
san salvador by midnight there we must
remain concealed all day the next night
sam will go over to the island of santa
scientia with us and we shall again hide
until the moment to strike we can only
hope that the weather is favorable

  they set out in the evening without hav-
ing aroused the suspicions of anyone in
guayaquil the yacht was provided with
weapons of all sorts and the twenty men
who had jestingly called themselves con-
quistadors after the cavaliers of the days
of cortez and pizarro had determined and
adventurous faces

  the trip went smoothly they landed in
a lonely bay on the coast of san salvador
they had no need to hide since no one was
to be seen and they would certainly not be
betrayed by the tortoises and iguanas the
sole inhabitants of this shore

  the sea was perfectly calm and the night
quite dark when they commenced the trip
across in two large boats which they had
brought with them for years no boats
had approached the coast on that side

  at midnight they landed on the steep bar
which now divided the old inca bay from
the sea sam first crept cautiously over the
rocky wall and soon returned everything
is all right the motorboat which usually


wonder stories

lies over yonder is moored here at the
shore

  the twenty men climbed up and came
down on the other side sam started the
noiseless motor the boat glided across the
little body of water and disappeared
through the gate into the subterranean lake
long since widened to make a great entrance
it touched at the far shore

  now you wait here through the day
i shall sneak into the city and look up mac-
gonnor i shall come back with him to-
morrow night then you may act

  the negro was right but it was not easy
for the twenty men to wait there calmly
while the boat and the black man disappear-
ed in the distance only a slight shimmer
of light came through the open rock gate
and then they no longer saw the boat

  we are in his hand

  what if he betrays us

  this american will not pay him any
million

  christobal laughed what about our-
selves

  we have at least promised it to him
  for how long are we provisioned
  for two days

  supposing he does not come back
then we w act ourselves but we need
macgonnor

	 

during the next day the twenty became
still more impatient one of them a
swiss adventurer by the name of hospenthal
showed a determined face if the negro
does not return nothing is lost there is
some wood lying down there which they
brought here with it we will build a
raft

  we ought to have brought an extra boat
they sat by the shore and saved the light
of their lamps because they did not know
how long they would need it close before
them was the black water while above them
was the dark cave everything wrapped in
stygian darkness the perfect stillness
was uncanny the men did not speak but
simply stared wide-eyed out into the dark-
ness no light appeared and no motor
hummed from time to time they turned on

one of their lights they did not even know
whether the water was rising or falling it
was damp around them and when the lights
were switched off and the darkness took
possession of them then it seemed as though
demons from the lower world were groping
for them with ghostly hands

  hour after hour passed the night was
over the day came a day bringing no
light to them horror was slowly creeping
into the hearts of these men who were re-
solved to risk their lives in battle with hu-
man beings

	 

  it was again morning muller was stand-
ing with bob and elsa dorn was also in
the room

  helling nodded in satisfaction i was
worried last night the motorboat was gone
but now it is there again i was worried
without reason perhaps mr cook used
if

  bob entered cooks office mr cook
did you go on the lake of the gods last
evening

  no i just went over to our natural park
a little while

  bob thought it better not to mention the
motorboat probably one of the engineers
had taken a little ride without permission

  on his part cook asked where is mr
macgonnor

  he must have been dead-tired he went
to walk yesterday but today he seems to be
still asleep no wonder stowing away in
the ship did not give him a pleasant trip

  let him sleep he who sleeps sins not
says the proverb-

  elsa dorn was still in her room on
this day her work did not start until after-
noon she did not know why she felt so
uneasy perhaps she was the only one to
whom this stranger macgonnor seemed an
object of suspicion he did not belong

  she went over and entered the vestibule
of his sleeping room she herself did not
know why she did this if he was in his
room she would say she had made a mis-
take but the door of the room was still
locked

she became worried could anything
utopia island

have happened to him she pressed a but-
ton knowing that now a loud bell was ring-
ing in his room which would be bound to
waken the sleeper then she held to her
ear the telephonic receiver with which she
could hear any sound but all remained
still

  she repeated the bell signal and listened
again nothing stirred elsa stood and re-
flected she was becoming more uneasy
and she did not know what to do should
she wait or should she call bob white
she started for she thought she heard steps
approaching

  bob stood behind her you here
  are you thinking the same as i

  what do you think

  that there is something queer about this
macgonnor

  wait a minute if i press this second
button the door will automatically open
i did not want to do it because i am a
girl

  but i will

  the door opened they saw that the bed
was untouched

  what now

  i was equally full of doubt moller
never spoke to me about a nephew with a
scotch name it is another spy

  elsa said anxiously do you think he
took the motorboat

  i do not know at present i shall say
nothing to cook but shall keep my eyes
open i shall tell only helling and the
assistant engineer bollman one of the most
reliable of our new men  it is well that
the german scientists are not in town to-
day-

the attack begins

a day and a night had passed since the
conspirators had reached the under-
ground lake it was again night

  our food is coming to an end
  tomorrow we will make the raft
  macgonnor has been caught

  then they would have searched the lake
  i hope we find the landing

  we must look for it and if necessary
take it by force of arms-

  midnight again joao seized christobals
hand isnt that a light over there
macgonnor is coming

  or else the enemies searching the lake
the light rapidly became larger soon
the motorboat could be recognized and the
humming of the propeller sounded loud in
the silent night the men held their loaded
weapons in their hands ready for anything
a whistle a signal

  it is macgonnor

  his voice came to them it is i be
ready to get on board

  the motorboat was at the shore

  be quick we must get back at once
the boat must not be missed

  they embarked and went back then
macgonnor called here we are

  they could already hear the rushing wat-
er which fell into the turbines

  there is the landing

  the motor was shut off the men held
their breath and got out as quietly as they
could

  no one is here the boat has not been
missed we are lucky

  stepping softly the conspirators climbed
up cautiously looked about hurried into the
open country and followed macgonnor to
hide themselves in some bushes in the dead
of the night   

	 

  while the conspirators were entering the
territory of isabella elsa dorn lay in a
restless half-sleep this time she had real-
ly dreamed about strange things about
secret assassins who were entering the city
she was unable to remain in bed and so got
up the next day was sure to bring plenty
of work better to get to work now than
to be sleepless and tormented by anxious
feelings

  she went down to the lower hall to fetch
her papers and sat down at the desk for a
moment to go through the portfolios then
she started voices were about her soft
whispering voices collecting her thoughts
she understood in this room a whole sys-
tem of microphones came together so that
if was possible especially in the stillness
of night to hear from this place every sound
every conversation in the streets of the oity


wonder stories

  it must be done tonight

  tomorrow is too late

ome i will take you to his room
then it became perfectly still but
elsa was full of horror now she was wide
awake she ran down the stairs trembling
at every step terrified at her own shadow
and only breathed freely when she saw bob
white who was just about to go to his own
room

  what are you doing on the street at
night v

  i was looking for you

 me

  there are bad people criminals in the
city

  you have had a nightmare

i heard them through the microphones
come in here and tell me bob led
her into one of the now empty offices con-
vinced that she had simply been dreaming

  the conspirators were a few yards away
from them in another room but now no-
one heard their whispering for the room
with the microphones was now empty

	 

  what next

  the negro sam was the one who spoke
first we must attend to this benjamin cook
i know how in the central building we
just have to look through the instruction
book turn the right lever on the car which
the number of the book tells us and the
car takes us to him

  he will be guarded

  no he sleeps all alone in his room
led by sam macgonnor christobal and
joao ferreira were whisked through the
passages of the central building

  bob white and elsa dorn stepped out of
the room in which she had told him all she
had heard

  go back to sleep it all seems very im-
probable to me but i shall keep watch
along with helling who is near by i am
convinced that tomorrow you will laugh at
the ghosts you thought you heard

  elsa obeyed him hesitantly and while
bob softly went away she stepped into the
central building she had just time to hide
behind a pillar when four figures sneaked

past her in one of them she thought she
recognized macgonnor she wanted to
shriek loudly but she could not utter a
sound but then she saw two other forms
bob white and helling hurrying along by
the walls with three others following she
went to her room with trembling knees 
bob had made use of the moment which
had passed after he had left elsa to be
sure he did not believe there was any dan-
ger but he was cautious he put a little
whistle to his lips and blew very strongly
yet no sound could be heard it was one
of the whistles that many american police
stations have these produce extraordin-
arily high pitches so that the human ear
cannot hear them but they affect very deli-
cate diaphragms worn by those on watch 
bob helling and three other men whom
elsa no longer could see softly entered the
government building and saw the four con-
spirators standing at the switchboard
knowing what to do they hurried through
a side passage and went up in one of the
cars while the conspirators did not suspect
that pursuers were already on their trail
and were waiting for them in the roof gar-
den

chapter xv
invasion

mr cook as always was entirely
alone he was just about to lie
down why should he have guards about
him in isabella he was convinced that
there were no criminals in the country of
santa scientia

  the door opened and three men stood be-
fore him joao ferreira don christobal
and macgonnor the negro sam had re-
mained outside and was watchfully hiding
among the shrubbery of the roof garden

  mr cook looked around in astonishment
and did not understand what visitors were
entering his room in the night so late
gentlemen

  we should like to say a few words to
you	i

  now so late

  you are not asleep
utopia island

  cook recognized macgonnor but still did
not understand who brought you here
macgonnor smiled things are made
easy for a person in isabella we only
needed to look up the number of your room
on the list the fine car brought us here
anyway you are very trusting my dear mr
cook

how so i need no fear in isabella
undoubtedly your room bristles with
hidden weapons and concealed bell-pushes
macgonnor laughed uneasily while asking
this question

  absolutely not there is no bell-push
here because when i am here i want to be
undisturbed and i certainly do not need
weapons

  not even today

  cook was getting angry at the strange be-
havior of these people please leave me
if you have some desires i shall expect
you tomorrow in my office he kept cast-
ing questioning looks at joao and don
christobal not understanding how there
could be in isabella any faces unfamiliar
to him

  now joao stepped forward i am joao
ferreira the son of the president of puitu
don christobal you must have seen from
previous visits to my father macgonnor
has already presented himself to you
the nephew of mr moller

  that has nothing to do with it

  cook was beginning to get nervous
well what do you want gentlemen
joao smiled pleasantly a little business
deal here is a hundred thousand dollars
sell me for it your supposed right to the
iguana islands and leave the city tonight
cook thought he had to do with lunatics
or drunken men are you going to leave
me alone now

  oh no my dear sir i know that you
cannot defend yourself and that you have
fallen into the snare now we will settle
our accounts

  get out

  mr cook was beginning to understand
he was about to go to the door but saw that
it was closed that the car was gone and
that christobal was pointing a revolver at
him

  hands up or i fire

  before the likewise closed window stood
macgonnor also holding a revolver

  what does this mean stop this com-
edy

  it is no comedy

  what would be the use of your shooting
me

  enough as soon as i fire three shots
out of this window your friends will also
be dead and the machines in our hands we
are not alone and we have dependable
helpers

 you 

  tomorrow there will no longer be a ben-
jamin cook or anyone who could call him-
self his heir no santa scientia but the
iguana islands will again belong to puitu
then are you cowardly pitiful murder-
ers

  we are men who want to restore what
foolish agreements have given away

cook had regained his self-possession
you are ridiculous why dont you
shoot if you think you can destroy my work
by my death he reflected feverishly
thought of ways to save himself and real-
ized in this moment that he had been too
trusting

  will you leave the city

  no

  very well we are not executioners if
you will sign something 

  you are murderers

  we will give you five minutes

  cook was perfectly calm he sought a
way of safety his thoughts wandered in-
voluntarily he lowered his eyes then it
seemed to him as though he heard a soft
sharp click he looked up and the room
was empty the three men had vanished
without leaving a trace

  cook stood a moment as though trans-
fixed then he stepped to the window and
opened it outside the night was as silent
as before

  he stepped to the switchboard and press-
ed a button after some time came the
car with an operator where have the three
men gone who were in my room you
must have seen them on the glass plate


wonder stories

which indicates the course of the cars
there was no car en route and i have
seen no one

  no one

  certainly not

  very well

  cook was alone again had he dreamed
all this dreamed that these men attacked
him

  during the moments that mr cook had
been looking at the floor in desperate
thought while the villains with raised re-
volvers were thinking only of the fulfillment
of their plan the door and window had
softly opened quick hands encircled the
throats of the criminals without a sound
they collapsed and were lifted into the car
when cook heard the click of the closing
door which started him from his thoughts
the four conspirators-for sam had previ-
ously been fettered-were already fastened
up and were going under the guard of bob
and helling out of the interior of the city

  mr cook who knew as little of these
things as of the role which elsa dorn had
played opened the door went out con-
vinced himself that the deepest quiet pre-
vailed everywhere and began to think his
nerves must be weak-

  the next morning elsa was uneasily walk-
ing back and forth in her office when bob
entered he showed a face of perfect equan-
imity good morning elsa

  thank god elsa drew a breath of
evident relief

  why say thank god

  she perceived that he did not want to
speak of the matter but she knew that the
danger was over-

  outside the city the conspirators were
shut up in an old cave undergoing judg-
ment benjamin cook and all his fellow
workers were assembled opposite them
stood the conspirators bound and guarded
by chinese coolies

  what have you to say

  joao held his head high simply that
we have lost

  at least you are not cowardly

  why should we deny what you have
seen

  why did you disturb our peace

  to repair what the government of puitu
has done if the job had succeeded santa
isabella would now belong to puitu and
with it the inca gold

  you are assassins

  patriots

 and now

  we are at your mercy

  we will consider your fate

  there was only a short discussion and
then benjamin cook said we should have
the right to put to death at least don joao
don christobal and macgonnor you
wanted to murder me but heaven has pre-
vented it today you will be delivered to
the government of puitu and it may judge
you

  the men did not reply for a moment it
looked as though don christobal was about
to rush at cook but bob held him back-
an hour later a great zeppelin set out
for the continent for the first time there
were bound men sitting in it men with
gloomy faces they knew that they would
find no thanks at home the revolutionist
whose stroke fails is doomed

  assistant engineer muller was to take this
human cargo to puitu-

a family meeting

bob walked silently into the govern-
ment building and met elsa dorn
elsa i thank you you saved mr cook
elsa blushed jumped into a car and
sped away without answering

  in the evening the german guests were
brought back from the watering place of
alesia bob himself was the one who con-
ducted them in santa isabella all was calm
again except for the guards and the friends
no one had suspected anything of the great
danger which had hovered over them all

  are you refreshed have you talked
things over together

  we are enthusiastic

  then may i ask you to give us your
judgment of the work tomorrow

  the gentlemen were again in the guest
room eating and taking walks an hour in
length in the roof garden alone no one
disturbed them in wonderful harmony the
utopia island



light shone through the colored panes of
the windows majestic in its unique beauty
the city of the future lay before them and
high up on the roofs the night wind was
fanning the palms

   

  the twenty conspirators were ill at ease
in the big zeppelin on which they had to
make their return trip under the conduction
of engineer muller still less pleasant was
the moment when the airship was sinking
before the capital of puitu

  nothing at all had actually happened to
them they had not even been fettered but
they had simply been stowed in the large
passenger cabin at first they were fairly
content they spoke together in spanish
after they had convinced themselves that
muller did not understand this

  they are after all great fools these so-
called prophets of the future we will wait
until we are high in the air and then we
will easily settle this one man

  the swiss hospenthal nodded i have
operated airships for years first we will
go to america i mean to some lonely
stretch of coast in california then we will
be safe

  joao laughed evilly i plainly saw them
load in ten gold bars quite openly before
our eyes probably the zeppelin is to con-
tinue on after delivering us the gold is
not much but it is something

  the airship was sailing over the sea
they looked cautiously into the pilot cabin
mr muller was lying in an airchair asleep
apparently the airship was under remote
control

  now is the time

  hospenthal went to the door but when
he was still about a yard from it an in-
scription lighted up look out elec-
tric current dangerous to life

  for a moment they stood hesitating but
then they saw that muller was now not even
stirring in his chair hospenthal shook his
head bluff where would the electric
current come from here do not be scared
he stepped further and laid his hand on
the latch of the door immediately he
slumped and hung on the door uncon-

scious simultaneously there was a loud
ringing of a bell

  muller got up and pressed a lever hos-
penthal fell to the floor and immediately
the lever was moved back again while the
loud speaker of the microphone used by
muller sounded forth why ridicule our
warning this time only a relatively weak
current was on the man will recover now
i have full current in all wires anyone
who even touches a wall from now on will
be killed at once

  they carried hospenthal to the sofa he
had severe burns on his hands but he re
covered consciousness

  with an angry gesture don joao threw his
cigarette butt against the door these
miserable machines truly nothing can be
done against these men

  after that the twenty doomed men sat
together in silent rage watching the zeppe-
lin fly over the coast of puitu and rise to
the mountainous land the center of the
state

  muller was now at the controls and the
airship swept down in elegant spirals if
the conspirators had had a last hope of be-
ing able to escape at the moment of land-
ing this was lost for they saw that the
whole square was surrounded by soldiers
and that they are coming closer and closer
together once they left the cabin-of
course after the current had been shut off
-they were taken to the city under strong
guard while the zeppelin rose again into
the air under mullers control

  now there was at least a little consola-
tion for the conspirators that it was night
and there were no spectators to view the
miserable return of the conquering heroes
they were put in the state prison a build-
ing erected on some old inca structures
it consisted of blocks which now after cen-
turies were still so solid and perfectly fitted
that one could not have inserted a knife
blade in the cracks-

  it was a most peculiar meeting which the
aged president ronaldo ferreira celebrated
with his son in the grey of morning wtiile
the president stood there with folded arms
jcao sat on his stool with a defiant mien

  i have had to accustom myself to hav


wonder stories

ing my own son for my enemy trying to
get my office but that you should join with
the assassins 

  joao sprang up that is not true i
wanted to  

  you wanted to murder

  i do not deny it i wanted to restore
what you lost to our country

  nonsense i sold a desert island
  with the millions of the incas

  have you seen them

  not i but    

  that is madness we searched the is-
and for years we should never have found
the treasures only that alesius knew the
way if there was one but you have acted
like a silly boy you have sneaked as a
thief into a territory belonging legally to
an american a citizen of the united states
you will be to blame if we have serious
trouble you were a fool a band of ad-
venturers is not fit to do anything good
now you impose on me the saddest duty of
my life

  what duty

  what befits assassins

  are you going to  

  i always shall do what my duty dic-
tates

  the old man looked seriously and sadly
at his son the latter was again sitting de-
fiantly his head in his hands the presi-
dent shook his head and went out

exiled

twenty-four hours had passed and
the prisoners who were each locked in
a separate cell had learned nothing of their
fate it was not until the next night that
they were led all strongly shackled into a
room of the prison in which a court had as-
sembled around the person of the president
he addressed the assembly

  i have received a request from the own-
er of santa scientia he wishes that these
immature lads be not punished therefore
gentlemen you are banished from puitu
this very night you will be put across the
frontier death is the penalty for any of

 you who again appears in puitu without
 granting his son a glance ronaldo ferreira
 left the hall the conspirators drew breaths
 of relief and remained silent

    the president returning to his palace real-
  ized that he could be thankful for the acti-
  vities of these rash youths by their deed
  they had put him in a position to exile the
  leaders of the opposition party from the
  land at one stroke

    he made ready to receive the emissaries
 of the united states ronaldo ferreira was
 not the man to forget his own advantage
 the united states supported him and the
 inca gold if it had been found again would
 have ruined him

	 

    in a miserable little harbor saloon in the
 colombian city of tucuma the twenty con-
 spirators were again assembled the swiss
 hospenthal having his hands still bandaged

   what now

   we have failed i am going to frisco
 my generous father has left me enough to
 be able to travel on a coastwise ship

   joao winked at christobal and macgon-
 nor and they nodded we are coming
 with you

   and we

   joao shrugged his shoulders i cannot
 help you

you led us into this cried one angrily

    you were going to get us countless mil-
 lions

   why did you hesitate why didnt you
 shoot at once and kill the american why
 did you let yourselves be surprised

   are you going to heap any more re-
 proaches on me i lost more than all of
 you

   they drank glass after glass of brandy
 and as their dispute became more and more
 heated they reached for their knives the
 saloon was full of rough fellows who took
 sides in this drunken brawl suddenly re-
 volvers were fired

joao leaped up from the floor tore the
lamp from the wall and with a quick heave
flung it out of the window in the darkness
f joao christobal and macgonnor utilized
the opportunity to jump from the window
utopia island



  they ran along the shore soldiers came
crying what is it

  there is a fight in the santa inez sal-
oon

  shots were heard and loud yelling then
a great crash at once a flare of fire could
be seen the soldiers ran thither and the
inhabitants of the little city were startled
out of their beds the brawl had become
a battle drunk with brandy the men of
tucuma-sailors and rabble-had for some
time been fighting with the strangers

  joao christobal and macgonnor stopped
to get their breath we are rid of them
you have money

  enough for the three of us

  they walked out of the city and along the
beach

  are we really going to frisco

  for the present

  and then

  joaos eyes shone catlike in the dark
well have the millions of santa scien-
tia

  bravo

  sam is again on the island he will
help us

  he does not know where we are

  i thought it all out and our chance fail-
ure i left him an address in frisco and
perhaps he will send news there

  i was a fool often three men accom-
plish more than twenty i am going to have
those millions

  then let us first go to frisco

a week later the three men arrived in
the port of punta reyes they had
meanwhile altered their appearance their
beards had grown they wore old clothes
and they looked like shipwrecked sailors
they had also chosen new names and in
their new characters they found a chance to
work their way toward frisco on a small
sailing vessel part of whose crew had de-
serted

  even if the captain did wonder at the
clumsiness of the new sailors he found them
at least willing workers and since the weath-
er remained favorable the cruise was sat-
isfactorily accomplished after all it had
not been in vain that joao had taken exten-

sive trips on his own yacht with his friends
in former days

  in panama they were paid off they
changed their clothes again and a week
later were sitting a little hotel in frisco
reading the papers a feature story told
how president ferreira of puitu got rid
of his enemies

  there was a rather mocking despatch re-
counting how ferreira had expelled his son
from the country after the latter had again
made himself ridiculous as a treasure dig-
ger on the desolate iguana island

  another item followed this the rebel
joao ferreira who was exiled from puitu
with his fellow conspirators lost his life
in the seaport of tucuma in a low brawl
poor puitu if such vagabonds were intri-
guing for the presidency

  joao laughed we will give them an-
other nut to crack just wait

  the three vanished from the confusion of
the metropolis a week later if anyone
from puitu had seen the elegant gentleman
with the pointed beard with hair a little
grey at the temples who called himself don
miguel almeida an argentine who had tak-
en a position with a large automobile com-
pany as a racer-he would not have recog-
nized in him joao ferreira no more would
anybody have noticed a similarity between
the full-bearded bespectacled scot maclver-
sen and macgonnor or between the brown-
haired now smooth-shaven chilean serao
argonza and the secretary don christobal

  the two latter gentlemen were regular
evening patrons of the gambling dens in the
port the negro sam had not been heard
from

	 

  the scientists visiting the iguana island
had known nothing of the night of terror
in which a few murderous villains had near-
ly wrecked the work of mr cook cook
and white were as calm as ever the next
day however they had established guard
duty at the electric microphones and in the
central building a troop of armed men was
always ready

  in the great hall of the central building
were assembled the makers of santa scien-
tia there were perhaps fifty men in all


wonder stories

besides the seven women and at a special
table of honor were the six members of the
expedition

  mr cook rose to speak we have told
you gentlemen that we regard your visit
as that of an examining commission here
wc have created quietly a new world we
have had ample means but thus far we have
anxiously avoided outside eyes now tell
ui frankly what impression our experiment
has made on you

  as the senior of the visitors prof ortler
replied first one question first here
you have almost nothing but germans we
are a german expedition but you are an
american how does it happen that you
put germans so in the foreground

  cook smiled it would seem as though
i wanted to found a german colony here
i am an american though after all of ger-
man descent we have thus far been work-
ing purely scientifically even the city
plan which we have used here has rested on
a scientific basis do you not know the
expression that germany is destined to be
called the university of the world

  as soon as i need practical tireless work-
ers which i hope will soon be the case i
shall get americans our athletic instruc-
tors will be english in our model indus-
tries we shall bring in chinese for the care-
ful personally managed agriculture jap-
anese shall teach us the art of preparing
lacquer work more chinese in cooperation
with koreans shall make precious paper
italians are to open schools of painting
persians will be at the head of our rug
weaving establishments	f

  from the savages of the primeval forest
we will learn to observe nature and to make
many plants useful to ourselves each na-
tion has its particular gifts therefore each
shall utilize its gifts in peaceful rivalry in
the great world university of santa scientia
and develop them for the good of all human-
ity

  we intend to make the entire world one
great unit so that each respects the other
and each learns from the other so that the
vast tropical forests and the boundless prair-
ies may in the future become granaries while
industry predominates in the rest of the

temperate zones wars will die out of
themselves and world peace will make
brothers of all men

plans for the future

dr schliiter arose i am no scholar
i am a man of practical life your
great work seems empty as long as there
are only men here

  it will not be so in the future now may
i ask you gentlemen for your judgment
said cook

  again ortler commenced i came hith-
er under compulsion with the intent to cri-
ticize yet i am converted your attempts
to change barren land into fertile soil by
artificial watering and mechanical cultiva-
tion have been successful likewise your re-
placing of human labor by machines

  prof zolling stood up the use of na-
tural volcanic forces is a magnificent idea
i declare myself ready to cooperate in the
attempts to make alaska warm by such
means

 van rhyn nodded vigorously you
have shown new lines of development for
electricity

  gumppendorf the young meteorologist
chimed in you have accomplished some-
thing astounding in the way you influence
even the weather

  frank arose i am eager to work with
prof weigand on the problem of combat-
ting old age and i marvel at your hygienic
equipment

  zolling took the floor yet all that you
have done here is simply a beginning an
experiment now you must make the test
of opening your university to the world
you must get in new minds and develop
teachers you must test on a large scale
what you have worked out quietly you
must turn to the league of nations it must
recognize you as a miniature nation for
if is necessary that this world university
which is never to be involved in two things
politics and war shall not belong to any
existing nation but be an organic whole of
itself

 cook arose i thank you in two
months santa scientia will be opened to the
utopia island



world mis dorn as the youngest among
us will you present your plans to these gen-
tlemen i have the pleasure gentlemen to
present to you the national womans club
of santa scientia the only womans organ-
ization in the world which can boast of
containing all the women of a state in
these seven young women of whom miss
dorn alone is unmarried you see all the
feminine inhabitants of santa scientia

  now elsa dorn stood up every eye was
turned to the young lady at this moment
the six professors saw her for the first time
and bob white was rather worried as to
how his young cousin would take her new
position

  unconcernedly elsa looked about the
conclusion which i reached was perfectly
natural because i have just come from the
outside world santa scientia is to be
shown to the world how can this be
done shall we attract here through the
travel bureaus several hundred thousand
tourists who will stare at us with lorgnettes
and monocles as though we were strange ani-
mals say very nice and then depart

  shall we steal more talented people and
be suspected of peonage or slavery shall
wc ask the governments to send tiresome
commissions to us this would be non-
sense we must make the whole world talk
of santa scientia all at once

  i am thinking of an athletic festival a
joyous gathering a festival to which only
people come who have strong bodies and
clear eyes of vision yet it is to be a sport
festival of a unique sort our sport shall
show the world in play what we can do
technically our guests will see isabella
the model city they will live in our glass
houses they will breathe the air of our roof
parks and the wearied ones will recover in
our sanitoriums our expresses will take
them through the sea our network of lines
and our automatic trains will carry them
through the island

  there will be no tiresome going about
as in a museum our guests will experience
all that santa scientia means for a week and
then return home having the feeling that
they have spent a week in the future then
they will make comparisons and thousands

will seek admission here and we shall
choose men and women will be welcome
and the best will fill our now empty indus-
tries to work under the sound of our indus-
trial music and the world university will
b- opened elsa had spoken with enthus-
iasm

  a sport festival not a bad idea
now bob white stood up may i tell
you what we call sport what we want to do
in our great arena

  he gave a long talk every kind of
sport was involved occasionally he had
one of his friends explain vetter or one of
the engineers and the longer the talk went
on the more desirous the scientists became
to hear more

  now cook stood in the middle of the hall
i thank you tomorrow we shall send out
invitations to all the world on our own
or on hired ships we shall bring to isabella
in a single day a hundred thousand guests
from all parts of the earth we will how-
ever make the condition that the league of
nations grant us the right of selection and
our own independent management uninflu-
enced by any power

  and if it does not

  cook spoke very seriously i have
pledged myself to use the inca millions only
for the purpose of benefitting humanity
our arrangements give us the possibility of
forcibly removing the island from any out-
sider below the treasure chamber in
which our possessions are stored is a great
quantity of explosives at the moment that
they would force me to give santa scientia
and the inca money to avarice or to selfish
politics i would press a button and blow
myself and the whole island into the air
but it will not come to that

chapter xvii
preparing

when mf cook had ended the six pro-
fessors came forward to press his

hand

  then you will remain as our guests till
the great sport festival


wonder stories

  van rhyn shook his head i ask to be
permitted to help

  i too

  and i with all my heart

  that very day the six gentlemen were re-
ceived into the community of santa scien-
tia

  dr schliiter then asked what can i
do

  there is a very important post for you
doctor during the period when we shall
have the presence of great crowds we shall
need something which hitherto did not come
into our plans and which i hope we can dis-
pense with in the future may i ask you
t take a number of dependable men from
our workers and create a police force for
santa scientia for the festival week

  dr schliiter was delighted it was no
trifling task to be the guardian of public
order in an assemblage of a hundred thou-
sand people

  an hour later cook called elsa dorn to
his office he was again quite brief and
businesslike you will undertake the ad-
vertising

  yes

  in the next three days you will invite
the hundred thousand guests print the pro-
spectuses send them and hire the ships for
transporting the people

  yes

  you can do that

  yes mr cook

  whom do you need for help

  here only mrs helling and in frisco
mr moller

  good

  all this would have seemed incredible to
a stranger but here it was perfectly natural
a young girl was going to perform with
the help of a single young woman a task
which ordinary human judgment would
have considered necessitating an army of
aids elsa dorn knew what she was pro-
mising she did possess this army of aids
only these were machines not people who
tired easily

  the new converts to santa scientia how-
ever had other work machines under their
direction had been at work for some days

converting into a gigantic arena an incred-
ibly huge piece of land which hitherto had
been only a lava waste it was not level-
led but it was ploughed up and strange
electric fields devised by vetter and van
rhy were built in and great moving bands
constructed others again- were at work
night and day under grotefendt and the
swiss in performing other startling things
in the subterranean lake of the gods
while still others were preparing a second
place for the soccer games

  from frisco came shiploads of machine
parts day after day the submarine railway
carried freight trains of furniture rugs and
all the things intended to make into a hotel
city the buildings of isabella

  one person however was secretly sneaking
about with open eyes and listening ears able
to elude the observation of schliiter the
negro sam

  elsa dorn had to work feverishly to carry
out the task which she had imposed on her-
self she had a strange office a number
of helpful spirits were about her yet not a
single human being there stood huge
machines remarkable automatic typewriters
she only had to speak into their tubes and
at once the vibrations of her voice received
by selenium cells made the keys operate
moreover these keys again activated ingen-
iously devised typesetting machines so that
every word which she spoke which she of
course did with due consideration immed-
iately appeared as a completely typographi-
cal unit which was automatically printed
by a printing press

  mrs helling for some time her assistant
operated this press she had only to press
keys and at once the impression was auto-
matically made and thousands and hundreds
of thousands of copies came from the speed-
press were counted enumerated and ar-
ranged another pressure of a button and
the completed printings slipped into mail
tubes were forwarded by compressed air to
the great airship port barely a few min-
utes after elsa had spoken the advertising
sheets on which even illustrations had al-
ready been printed in the workrooms were
flying over the ocean
utopia island



besides the use of these machines
which kept up the work of the new ad-
vertising bureau elsa dorn had another
task which had been given her previously
and which she likewise managed all alone
the mail each day there were of course
many letters to dispatch and the number
was now growing larger and larger it con-
stantly delighted the professors of the expe-
dition to look at this girl at work she
worked steadily until finally after eight
hours of the most intense labor mental of
course clear siren whistles announced over
isabella and at the same time over all santa
scientia the hour of rest when all the mach-
ines automatically stopped

  while attending to the mail elsa sat in a
comfortable armchair and had before her an
apparatus looking like the keyboard of a
typewriter but which was in reality made
up of a countless number of buttons govern-
ing electric circuits about her she had a
whole arsenal of machines clear up at the
left was a funnel-like arrangement out of
which letters fell one after another on a
moving belt of course with every invita-
tion likewise with any other correspondence
received only a standard sized envelope
was used a little knife descended and the
letter was opened two springs seized it
and it was unfolded now it appeared on
the first of the glass plates on the wall
strongly illuminated and magnified by a
lens now elsas work began without
any trouble she read the letter pressed a
button if necessary to turn it and read on
the other side otherwise she connected
another wire and the letter began as it
were to demand its answer automatically in
case elsa did not press the button marked
wastebasket

  if eisa pressed the button marked answer
the letter glided along the moving belt to the
typewriter and the latter lighted up elsa
still sitting in her chair dictated the reply
which the typewriter took down a new
pressure of a button and the completed let-
ter slipped into the machine for folding and
putting in the envelope while the carbon
copy and the answered letter passed through
a date stamper and went according to the
alphabetical files the envelope machine

put the letter under a second typewriter
elsa dictaated the address and the letter
went off at the right on the inclined plane
to the postoffice

  but if they were letters to be answered by
an invitation other moving belts came into
play after the letter had been read behind
the glass plate it was provided with number
and date and then moved to the listing mach-
ine which at elsas dictation wrote the name
and address in the list of visitors the num-
ber of the invitation always appeared above
it in large characters then an envelope
with the invitation card and the ship card
fell out of a container went to the folding
and typing machines and was sent out

  elsa had nothing to do but sit in her
comfortable chair read the large writing on
the wall and press the various buttons a
mistake was impossible if she ever forgot
one of the mechanical steps then the whole
confusion of belts and wheels which much
resembled a railroad train stretched along
the wall simply stood still and a buzzing
sounded until the point neglected was at-
tended to

  each letter had to be dealt with exactly
in the order of its arrival and none could
be forgotten or overlooked without over-
working or having to rely on the dependabil-
ity of others elsa always had exact know-
ledge of the state of all correspondences
only letters which she could not act on her-
self were sent along a special belt to another
container then in the presence of the of-
ficial responsible it was again put through
the system of belts and machines each of
the officials who had a department of santa
scientias activities under him possessed
such a box and there was a special mail
day set for each on which his correspon-
dence was sent out

  at first of course the correspondence
was limited to what was sent to mr moller
in frisco for as long as santa scientia had
been anxiously protecting its boundaries
correspondence with other people had been
impossible but there were often hundreds
of different questions to be settled hundreds
of orders to be handled now weigand
needed the latest scientific books and now
shipments of instruments from zeiss in jena


wonder stories

were required or from the various factor-
ies chemicals machine parts and lenses of
special kinds were needed

  then it was also mollers duty to keep
the santa scientia scientists informed about
all that was done and discovered in the world
in their specialties for this purpose smith

	co in frisco known as a great export
house for asia had in its offices hundreds
of men who had not only to inspect regis-
ter and pack but also to read all the news-
papers of the world and to arrange different
articles by subjects but these men had no
idea that it was not thousands of customers
they served but merely santa scientia

the world awaken

when the letters were completed in the
mechanical mail office of isabella in
which elsa dorn alone did the work for
which smith  co would have needed more
than a hundred employees they went
through a machine which affixed the postage
stamps there were so many letters that
in order to save time they were directed
in isabella to overseas or american firms
under the name of smith  co in frisco
provided with the necessary american
stamps because they were apparently sent
from frisco the letters automatically fell
into mailbags which were shut and sealed
they glided five hundred to a sack each
sack being labelled with the name of the
country to which it was going along mov-
ing belts to the submarine rajlway on the
island of cabo martino they were either put

	ships or sent by zeppelin to smith  co
at frisco as their first stop

  now all this was changed all invita-
tions and all replies to questions went di-
rectly from the island bearing for the first
time a stamp having on it an owl the bird
of wisdom and having the postmark santa
scientia

  while all the world in astonishment raised
the same questions what is santa scientia
where is santa scientia how was it pos-
sibly for santa scientia to originate with-
out mankinds noticing it-while this was
going on postage stamp collectors also got
greatly excited and the stamps with the owl

brought high prices at all stamp sales this
too was a remarkable matter stamps from
a country of which no one knew anything
formerly as has already been remarked
letters were never sent directly from santa
scientia even now at least a stamp of a
known country would have to be put but of
which country santa scientia no longer
belonged to puitu for it had been sold to
cook the use of an american stamp
would have been equivalent to recognizing
a higher authority so mr cook had de-
posited a large sum of money with the cen-
tral office of the international postal union
and had made his application to the league
of nations to be recognized as an indepen-
dent state in embarrassment as to what
to do the postal union in view of the money
deposited allowed use of santa scientia
stamps until the league of nations should
make its decision

  while the uproar was daily increasing
all over the world elsa dorn again had
peaceful days the invitations had been
sent a hundred thousand ships tickets had
been mailed to those whom elsa had selected
together with the festival commission com-
posed of bob white and mr cook

  now there were only replies of regret to
send out to the unsolicited applications to
attend the festival which arrived daily and
for this even elsa dorn herself was hardly
necessary all these letters were answered
with a stamped reply at least all that went
directly for most applications came via
frisco

  in isabella however work was being
quickly accomplished there was an in-
credible amount to be done iron cranes
moved their giant arms to surround the
arenas with grandstands and to built into
the roads the strange machines in whose
putting together and testing prof vetter
was vieing with his colleague van rhyn

  the orders received by smith  co were
strange and different from previous ones
please deliver five hundred first class
cooks and a hundred perfectly reliable wait-
ers within ten days one hundred thousand
brass beds with all the fittings fifty thou-
sand kegs of first class oysters a million
pounds of meat of all kinds twenty thou-
utopia island



sand hundredweight of butter a million
cans of preserves of all sorts there were
fabulous orders and before cabo martino
it looked as though a naval fleet were at
anchor the ships came so fast that only
the ingenious loading machines avoided
great loss of time

  the only ones unaware of the entire hub-
bub were the physicians weigand and frank
in quiet alesia while weigand had charge
of the sickrooms increased a hundredfold in
size frank now chief surgeon of santa
scientia was busy getting everything ready
for any surgical cases which might come up
he established for operating a hospital such
as he might have imagined in dreams but
certainly had never expected to realize

mr cook always accompanied by
bob showed himself a clever organ-
izer the chinese occupied newly erected
barracks and all the houses of the city were
changed to hotels while in the basements
giant kitchens were installed operated of
course with electric power for each trade
a model establishment was set up after
the years of creating santa scientia in a
retiring scholarly atmosphere this sudden
change was like a refreshing bath and the
whole island was in a whirl

  while the cooks were arriving and the
entire personnel was being trained in elect-
rical operation under mr moller elsa
dorn had a new idea she asked bob did
you think of the music

  the music while working

  elsa laughed that also but i was
thinking of dance orchestras

  dance

  bob looked at her in surprise and she
laughed do you want the hundred thou-
sand to get bored in the evening dont
you know that dancing is a sort of sport
suddenly it seemed to bob as though he
saw a vision he saw himself dancing it
seemed to him like an almost forgotten re-
minder of long past days elsa was stand-
ing before him humming a melody invol-
untarily his feet twitched right elsa we
must dance too

  a telegram went to frisco ten picked
orchestras deliverable at once

  they arrived but there were no orchestra
rooms for them in the arenas the sound-
proof transmitting rooms were arranged in a
building in which the orchestras played
these were specialized orchestras so to
speak one just for marches and such inspir-
ing compositions another a violin orchestra
with soloists another a jazz band a waltz
orchestra a gypsy orchestra an orchestra
for wind instruments and so on

  now it was easy both for the foremen
in the work rooms and also for the ath-
letic directors the recreation leaders and
the hotel directors out of the various loud
speakers the music could be brought any-
where by just pressing a lever suitable
music could be chosen for any occasion
on the other hand by alternating the orches-
tras a varied concert could be made up

  thus santa scientia prepared itself with
all its might for its great festival

on to santa scientia

on one and the same day there was a
sensation in the cities of america eur-
ope asia africa and australia there
were huge advertisements in the papers
immense advertisements in public squares
and men carrying through the streets great
placards with colored pictures

isabella the newly arisen city on the
iguana islands is opened to the world
the greatest sport festival in the world
in isabella the capital of santa scientia
the city of knowledge and the home of
scholars invites you

  championships of the world will be de-
cided at the olympic games in santa scien-
tia

  santa scientia the city of the future
every advertisement was adorned with
fantastic pictures in them could be seen
immense skyscrapers of glass towers which
radiated a fairy light into the world wild
desolate landscapes with giant iguanas and
an electric power plant as well grottoes
with fairy lighting containing shining stal-
actites and crystal-clear water in which
swimmers were competing strangely made


wonder stories

railroads going through the desert flying
autos and moving streets and motion pic-
tures showing a desert which before the
eyes of the spectators became covered with
luxuriant groves of palms while a city vis-
ibly grew out of the wilderness

  all this was santa scientia was it a
miracle or a vast swindle the whole world
spoke of nothing else at the same time all
sporting organizations of the whole earth
received invitations

  the greatest sport festival since nero
an arena in which a hundred autos start
side by side

  the greatest soccer competition

  flying meet

  sport of the future -
  flying men and autos

  from all sides questions were asked and
the answer was always the same in fact
we have no detailed knowledge as yet but
we are ourselves going to isabella

  it was advertising such as the world had
never seen wireless messages sped across
the ocean telegraph officials sent them
with doubtful shaking of the head and in a
few hours the replies came back-

  the league of nations held a meeting in
geneva there was a man present whom
no one knew a simple mr moller the
emissary of santa scientia

  santa scientia is the citadel of the
world peace it is invincible and centuries
ahead of the world it desires no war but
will always help any nation that guiltlessly
suffers

  where is santa scientia

  in the iguana archipelago

  then it belongs to puitu

  no it is an independent state-

  the following notice appeared in all the
newspapers on earth the league of na-
tions has resolved to send a commission to
santa scientia the sport clubs in lon-
don berlin paris brussels rome calcut-
ta bombay new york chicago san fran-
cisco tokio sydney hongkong madrid
lisbon and cape town have decided to
take part officially in the santa isabella
festivities the automobile factories of the
whole world are working feverishly

  a week later new placards and advertise-

ments were to be seen forty thousand
guests reported who is is coming to isa-
bella

  another week it read sixty thousand
guests reported on to isabella

  what a city that must be sixty thousand
guests were these actually guests of the
country what city could lodge sixty
thousand guests unless it was great and
powerful everywhere doubtful faces were
seen was it an incredible bluff

  new reports came one hundred thou-
sand guests the lists are closed all the
steamers of the north german lloyd the
hapag the woerman line the english
american and japanese companies have
been hired for two weeks or more all other
ocean travel will be suspended all steam-
ers are going to isabella that is those that
have first class accommodations a hun-
dred thousand persons from all over the
world are to arrive on one and the same
day a million made application and one
hundred thousand of them were selected
prominent men and women from all circles
who have given proof of their personal abil-
ity-statesmen merchants scholars me-
chanics and also especially able workmen

  in the- seaports there is great crowding
each one who received an invitation card
has free maintenance in a first class hotel
and a free ticket for the ship isabella is
the sole topic of conversation on earth the
times for departure are given exactly a
special luxurious yacht is carrying the re-
presentatives of the league of nations and
the european diplomats for weeks the
name of isabella has displaced all other in-
terests in the world

of course the remarkable advertise-
ments of santa scientia had appeared
in san francisco as well and here in par-
ticular a general uneasiness had taken pos-
session of the people how was it possible
that on the desert iguana islands which af-
ter all were not so far from california such
a sport undertaking could have been ar-
ranged without anything having been known
of it and just why was the place called
santa scientia after all what had sport
to do with sacred knowledge
utopia island



  many steamers altered their courses to ap-
proach the iguana islands but as soon as
they came near they had the experience of
the airships which tried the same thing
thing they were simply turned away by dis-
tant control their steering apparatus re-
fused to work now it was as though the
island were a magnetic mountain which
repelled everything which wished to ap-
proach it

  other notices appeared and were distrib-
uted especially in all the seaports of north
central and south america there is
urgent warning not to try to enter santa
scientia and the city of isabella before the
day of our festival no uninvited persons
will be permitted to land

  day by day as all this aroused the idea
that there was some mystery about the whole
affair the more curious everyone became
although most people were still convinced
that at the last moment the whole olympiad
at the iguana islands would prove to be a
great hoax there were three people in
frisco who had their own ideas don joao
ferreira who under the name of don mi-
guel almeida was an incredibly rash auto
racer macgonnor now named maclversen
and serao argonza into whom christobal
had changed himself the latter pair as a
matter of fact had sunk by degrees and
were making their living in the habor sal-
oons as notorious bilkers and cheats

  but don joao had still preserved some of
his former polish and his ambitious heart
had not yet given up his plan of returning
to puitu and of playing a prominent part
there therefore he did not entirely give
up his connection with the two comrades
who had so come down in the world after
all in the case of a bold stroke every keen
knife was welcome

  in the evening after the first high tide

	astonishment as the santa scientia adver-
tisements had reached frisco joao met the
two did you read it

  christobal shrugged his shoulders what
is that to us now everything is too late
or perhaps it is not

  they walked along the shore outside the
city not far from the rock from which the

 cliff house shone down with its bright
 windows

 joao had looked around several times
 and macgonnor asked what is the matter
 are you seeing ghosts

 it seems to me as if somebody were
 sneaking after us

 we are all alone

 not entirely gentlemen

 the three started for suddenly a person
 was standing beside them he had appear-
 ed so suddenly from the rocks that they
 could not help trembling

 good evening gentlemen

sam

 of course

 how did you get to frisco

 over the water

 have you been here long

 since yesterday i came as a stowaway
 it wasnt at all easy to travel over the ocean
 for eight hours under the hull of a zeppe-
 lin just swaying between some ropes
 what are you looking for here

 you gentlemen

 what is up

 now is the time

 for us

 yes if you still have courage yester-
 day i hoped so and to-day i know it

 at the so-called sport festival

 all isabella is in a whirl

and now

 not now but at the festival don joao
 yesterday i saw you at the great auto race

 i	have a plan

 dont tell me here we will go to my
 room

we are ready

 the four sat together and sam revealed
 his plan i have sharp eyes i got
 your letters but i did not want to write
 nobody will recognize you in all the crowd
 here i have what we need hese are four
 invitation cards which i stole along with
 the tickets they are for four different
 steamers one leaving from frisco one from
 panama one from lima and one from los
 angeles you have nothing to do but be
 at the piers at the right times


wonder stories

   that is how we get to isabella
but what are we to do there

  i know since i saw you in the race
this bob white who is now all powerful
in isabella is starting in the auto races he
actually is a fine driver but you are better
and bolder and i know that also mr mac-
gonnor and don christobal are fine drivers
and have probablycnot forgotten their skill
besides you have three weeks to train
but what good is this

  all three of you will take part in the
auto race you will draw lots-one of you
is to crash into bob whites car certainly
that one perhaps may lose his life but bob
must be destroyed

  what good will it do if bob white is
killed

  there will be a great excitement it
will be easy to stab cook in the confusion
bob white always carries the key to the
treasure vault and he will not leave it off
even in the race don christobal and mac-
gonnor will rush to the site of the accident
-that is in case don joao is the one driv-
ing otherwise the two who are not taking
part it will be easy to get there first be-
cause only these two will know what
is going to happen while i kill cook
the others will take the key from bob cry
out for doctors mix in with the crowd and
run to the treasure vault i know the pass-
word i heard it

  of course i shall be there too and dur-
ing the excitement about the accident in
the general confusion nobody will of course
pay any attention to us or to the treasure
we will take what we can filling our
pockets with gold and jewels taking the
cash which is kept there in great sums and
fill our suitcases then we will quietly go
back to our rooms and wait to see what
happens even if one of you comes to
grief i mean the one who runs into bob
white nobody will suspect you since no-
body will know that you three belong to-
gether for you will not see oije another in
isabella

  probably the games will be stopped and
the strangers will leave the more quietly
you behave the less suspicion will fall up-
on you for leaving also there are no cus-

  toms inspections and so no one will inves-
tigate your baggage if we are clever we
can secure millions yes we can perhaps
return there again later the santa scientia
project will be destroyed for cook and white
are the soul of the whole thing i myself
will disappear and come to you i will find
you all right just as i found you this
time

  don joao looked up the plan is not
bad

  macgonnor shook hife head i have not
driven a car for months

  christobal made the same remark adding
i dont think i would be skillful enough
joao smiled contemptuously we need
not draw lots i will drive i think i am
a better driver than this bob white i will
drive into him in such a way that his car
will be hurled out of its course without
anything happening to me it will look as
though through some mechanical defect i
lest control over my car i won the cham-
pionship of california here and i am not
afraid of bob white

  sam nodded in vigorous approval i
knew that

  joao went on i am risking my life and
you only have to steal probably you can
do that all right

  senor

  the two stood up but he waved them
back i do not need you five parts for
me two for sam and one and a half for
each of you

  that is  

that is fair i risk the most sam
brings the plan if you are not willing-
well trash like you i can find where i will
christobal nudged macgonnor after
all we are risking little

  there is much to be gained

  i will do it

  madre de dios it is cheating us but i
am ready	

  joao saw the two exchanging glances but
sam nodded to him i have them in my
hand

  all right so be it-

  the same night christobal travelled to
lima macgonnor to los angeles and sam
to panama it was decided that joao should
utopia island



quite openly take part in the olympic
games as the california champion almeida

in isabella the feverish excitement was
increasing from day to day elsa dorn
went about with a smile of proud satisfac-
tion she was really the originator of all
this new activity

  the engineers were working everywhere
actually the many new arrivals the cooks
waiters and musicians were rather disap-
pointed when they wanted to watch the
preparations they found all the arenas
fenced off in a wide circuit by wire net-
work with warning signs everywhere
danger electric current

  they also had little time for the cooks
especially had to learn their art all over
again however they were enthusiastic
about the kitchens they were relieved of
the real work they had the strangest
machines and devices water which auto-
matically flowed into kettles kettles which
pushed themselves onto the electric heating
plates current which shut itself off as soon
as the water came to a boil cocoa which
at the appointed time and with the right
amount of sugar flowed into the water with-
out human attention stirring spoons which
descended into the liquids and agitated
them and many other things

  the foods requiring no sampling and
tasting they mixed themselves all alone of
course bread was automatically mixed and
baked then it was pushed onto moving
belts which took the loaves to machines
which sliced them the slices moved on
until other machines buttered them and still
others put on the automatically-cut filling
for the sandwich there were likewise
moving belts which fetched from the cellars
bottles of wine indicated by pushing but-
tons uncorked them and put them in cool-
ers- how else would it have been possible
for so few cooks to provide all the meals
for one hundred thousand people moving
belts also carried the food to the long tables
and replaced most of the waiters

  in the meanwhile the previous inhabitants
of isabella who aside from their scientific
activity had always gone in much for ath-
letics were divided up and apportioned for

the different competitions bob white was
to take part in the auto racing he was
at the great arena almost all day practicing
with the car which vetter and grotefendt
had manufactured in accordance with a bold
idea of cooks the young assistant engin-
eers played soccer practiced gymnastics
and formed a swimming team elsa dorn
drilled the six other young women for fem-
inine parts in the activities

  it was strange that in the practicing of
each of these forms of sport either vetter
or van rhyn or one of the younger elec-
tricians was always present testing out ex-
tremely and peculiar apparatus constantly
changing and making improvements as
though there were great and difficult prob-
lems of science to be solved here

  the nearer the festival came the more
content all the faces became now the
most intelligent of the chinese had to learn
to carry on the industrial processes for a
time they were already accustomed to do
their work to music a foreman sat at the
control buttons choosing the music in the
loud speaker for each work according to
the proper tempo it was astonishing how
this music affected even the chinese with
their oriental calm

  meanwhile moller had returned to frisco
dr schliiter had organized a regular police
school and was training five hundred chi-
nese as guards but mr cook was the brain
of the whole thing he hurried from one
place to another saw what was lacking
tirelessly sent telegrams to frisco and kept
the offices of smith  co working hard
until at last the final evening came

  ready a tour of inspection took place
the six newly-arrived gentlemen who had
now become inspired adherents the former
founder of santa scientia and the women
among whom elsa dorn was of course one
had made a general try-out of their parts
in the program now in a mood of ap-
proaching success they were walking
through the roof gardens these had be-
come a huge park-a park high in the air
in which brooks fed by pumping stations
flowed under the palms and between bloom-
ing orchids and other tropical plants up
from the palm groves rose everywhere the


wonder stories

glass halls of the uppermost recreation
rooms which here looked like pavilions on
level ground though they actually were the
eleventh stories of buildings

  there was a magnificent look to the street
crossings at which ornamental bridges
spanned the spaces between particularly
the great space before the central building
was immeasurably beautiful

  they looked down at the glass fronts pf
the rows of houses street lighting would
have been useless for everywhere the light
shimmered from the space between the dou-
ble windows spreading equal brightness
within and without the colored windows
which had hues according to the work to
br done in the rooms had been so arranged
that there was a wonderful symphony of
color

  from the roof gardens the brooks plunged
over gaily lighted glass cascades in magic
waterfalls collecting again below in lakes
and brooks the arising moisture and the
constantly flowing stream of ozone gave to
this night a delightful freshness while a
few kilometers away on the nearest islands
there existed an intense intolerable heat

  when the gentlemen had finished their
walk mr cook said with a contented smile
we are ready now let our guests come

chapter xix
the landing

the great day dawned the day which
was to bring a hundred thousand guests
and the commencement of the festivities

  most of the guests had been skeptical of
the whole thing up to the last moment but
had changed their opinions only when it
was stated in the papers that all trans-
atlantic sailing was suspended for two
weeks the most beautiful and the greatest
steamers of all companies were chartered by
santa scientia each of these of whatever
origin flew in addition to its native flag
a gold banner having in the center an owl
the symbol of knowledge and the inscrip-
tion santa scientia

even now few knew exactly where santa
scientia was and no information was pro-

vided the times of departure of all thg
ships were so arranged that every steamer
must arrive at cabo martino at exactly a
predetermined time on the same day

  the excitement of the passengers was in-
describable after they were on board af-
ter the journey was actually commenced af-
ter they had been most magnificently at-
tended by stewards wearing golden sashes
with the arms of santa scientia there could
be no more suspicion of an american bluff
these very ships must have cost vast sums

  it was a great sight when whole fleets
approached cabo martino at the same time
from all directions on the leading ship
a luxurious yacht could be seen the banner
of the league of nations beside the flag of
santa scientia

  there were amazed and disappointed
faces when nothing could be seen but a
bare reef with wild surf tossing about it

  then is this all a swindle asked the
guests

  the ships stopped this produced new
mysteries the captains and other officers
who of course were initiated into the secret
and knew that novel electrical apparatus
was installed beside their engines left the
bridges

  a cry of horror went through the crowds
the ships seemingly without control
again began to move gliding nearer and
nearer to the rocks many ran to the life
belts but the captains showed smiling faces
we are in the sphere of the distant control
of santa scientia yet even the sailors
viewed with anxious faces the approaching
reefs

  now there appeared on the reef a single
man he had belted on a balloon filled with
helium as is frequently done for sport at
american athletic festivals with it he
sprang into the air and in a bold leap he
reached the deck of the foremost ship

  welcome to santa scientia

  is that santa scientia

  there was general wrath but the man
called through a megaphone just wait
this is only the harbor

  two hours later the first forty thousand
were entering the giant arena the first
ten steamers of which each had brought
utopia island



four thousand guest had steamed back
upon the high sea to make room for the next
ten and these forty thousand people who
were looking about with enthusiastic faces
as though they were transported into a new
world had experienced so much in these
two hours that they were hardly able to
collect their thoughts

  the excitement of the guests reached a
climax ever new throngs passed out of the
wide-open gates of the cars ship after
ship was landing passengers in the harbor
at cabo martino the submarine trains
went back and forth incessantly in the
outer roads lay more and more new steam-
ers bringing guests in amazement they
looked at the great boats which silently and
without crews glided to the sides of the
ships soon all were getting accustomed
to the marvel of the automatic distant con-
trol how smoothly it all went one boat
waited for another incessantly the glass
plates lighted up get in-please stop-
full

i automatically the doors of the cars open-
ed and shut again the number of those
who might enter was always counted ex-
actly there was nobody present to look
after the crowds machines regulated the
vast traffic-but not really the machines
rather helling who was their heart and
brain he sat in a little subterranean cell
continually the glow lamps and inscrip-
tions lighted up before him

   train en route

   five hundred in the cars

  five hundred more landed

   five hundred left steamer

  everything moved with perfect regular-
ity when a steamer was rid of its passen-
gers then a signal sounded in answer to a
lever pressure the ship moved aside and
another came on not an anchor fell shak-
ing their heads the captains had to obey
the orders given them by the engineer who
was on board each time a ship was emp-
tied the captain got back his command and
could seek an anchoring place under his
own power the engineer however pressed
a button on his leather suit behind him a
large balloon swelled out filled with an ex-
tremely buoyant gas which at the proper

moment was formed from chemicals in the
interior of the casing through a new dis-
covery of van rhyn a moment to test it
and then the man supported by this bal-
loon sprang to the amazemevit of the on-
lookers from one steamer to the next be-
hind it which was already obeying distant
control and was moving to the stopping
place of the one before it here he again
took over the command as though his leap
were the most natural thing in the world

helling conducted as though on a
typewriter the landing of the thou-
sands who had to obey the commands of
his machines

  five hundred went down in the elevator
automatically gates were opened a hun-
dred could go through one of these each
person entering set a calculating device in
operation  when there was a full hundred
the door gently closed making entry impos-
sible for others and moving the next ones
on a gliding belt toward the second gate
each hundred found itself before the open
door of the car and each found a seat in the
car

  at once everything was understandable
it would not even have required the voice
of the loud speaker which kept calling
warningly enough please take the mov-
ing belt to the next door

  in half a minute the five hundred were
settled the train slipped into the tunnel
and immediately another stood ready be-
hind it five hundred emerged from the
gates another five hundred entered the ele-
vators another five hundred were landing
while yet another five hundred were leaving
the steamer in a single hour thirty thou-
sand people sped through the tube of the
submarine railway to the city of isabella
in three and a half hours the hundred thou-
sand guests were there now everybody un-
derstood why it was so arranged that the
steamers arrived at exactly the same time
why no one was allowed to land earlier it
was the first victory of isabella a hundred
thousand guests and not a single person
who gave orders to them except one man
who gave instructions on board

  the huge grandstands about the vast race


wonder stories

track were filling with guests each time
a train came in the doors opened in a few
seconds the people were arranged on the
moving bands the first hundred were al-
ready going on them up the oblique pas-
sages while the last ones were leaving the
ears following the instructions of the loud
speakers and the routes indicated by signs

  a half minute stop and then the five hun-
dred had left the train this went on a
turntable and reached the tunnel going
back while its five hundred passengers were
riding up the moving bands to the grand-
stand gate and the seats intended for them
they saw nothing of isabella only this
mighty race course which was arranged to
be readily seen from everywhere of course
they had to wait and spend the first two
hours in their seats but what there was to
see in these two hours moving bands went
past their seats carrying refreshments
fruit sandwiches cakes fruit juice pro-
grams were in every seat

  it was approaching evening round about
towered the high glass structures these
glass towers forming the upper stories of
the factories they were giving out light
at bright as day the air was pleasant not
too warm not too cold was this the desert
of the iguana islands

  all of these many thousand who had
come from all parts of the world to dedi-
cate the stadium of isabella felt as though
there were something miraculous about it
still nobody had appeared no solemn
speeches were heard only strange music re-
sounding equally strong everywhere yet
without an orchestra in sight

  even the great race track was perfectly
empty

  bob stood in his stall dressed in a close
leather jacket and wearing goggles in-
wardly he was somewhat excited though
he was outwardly calm in vain his friends
had asked him at the last moment not to
start

  the hundred auto racers from all parts
of the world who were to enter the great
race with him were already guests of the
city though they had not seen it they oc-
cupied hotel rooms under the grandstands
where their garages were also located and

 they were allowed to practice on the track
 at will only the city was closed to them
 they were picked auto racers champions
 of all the countries on earth

 a remarkable race was to begin there
 was no examination of machines and there
 were no restrictions each driver was al-
 lowed to have two mechanics and each
 might use any car he preferred

 don joao had also arrived with his
 friends none of them had seen the others
 though each of them had seen sam and
 spoken with him learning that all three were
 ready

 don joao was deadly pale and had a
 gloomy determined face the last two
 weeks in frisco he had hardly left the track
 and had made wild records he had run
 into no less than ten cars in his uncanny
 trips without anything happening to him-
 self he was certain of his success now
 it appeared to him almost a special triumph
 that here in the presence of the whole world
 he could take his revenge for the disgrace
 that cook had imposed on him

	 

 elsa dorn made her way through the
 crowd and reached bobs stall he was
 ready to start and had a gay smile on his
 face

 bob

you here i have no time now

 you must listen to me

 after the races

 then it will be too late

 he saw that she was excited what is it
 then

 you must not start

 why not

 it will be your certain death and the
 ruin of santa scientia

 you are imagining things

 don joao is here

 the former assassin

 the same

 impossible you gave out the tickets
 yourself

 he is here and is starting in the auto
 races he certainly plans evil he is the
 leader of the california group

 nonsense i know definitely that he
 is the noted racer don miguel almeida
utopia island



  almeida is don joao he is disguised
and has a different beard but i made his
acquaintance too clearly before he i don
joao

  you are mistaken

  i swear it

  does dr schliiter know about this
asked bob calmly

  first i wanted to tell you so    
elsa could not continue

  schliiter is to watch him

  you must not start

   am going to i am not afraid of him
since when has my cousin been so timid
the howl of a siren shook the air simul-
taneously the great door opened and before
her stood the auto in which bob was to
start a most remarkable car shaped like a
torpedo and yet different from any known
model

  bob stepped up all ready

  van rhyn who was himself beside it
nodded bob swung himself in while elsa
rushed off to seek schliiter

  all right god be with you

       chapter xx
       the great race

a hundred thousand spectators were
sitting in the grandstands making a
most impressive sight far before them
stretched the track in its center was a
little lake in which water lilies were bloom-
ing

  a murmur of astonishment went through
the thousands the huge racetrack was be-
ginning to divide into a hundred individual
circles each rotating independently the
fiist or inner one the smallest circle re-
mained motionless the next moved slow-
ly meanwhile an explanation for this
sounded from the system of loud speakers
which was spread all over the track

  it is a failing of all racetracks that the
conditions are not equal for the different
drivers while the one on the inside travels
perhaps one hundred meters the driver on
the inside course to reach the same destina-
tion must go one hundred and fifty not
so here the moving bands are exactly syn-

chronized to one another the velocity of
the individual bands increases with their
length so that the outside one rotates fast-
est accordingly when the inside driver
travels one hundred meters the outside driv-
er has to go only a hundred meters to reach
the same goal the track therefore permits
a hundred drivers to start at the same time
under perfectly equal conditions the col-
lision of two drivers is completely excluded
for now there is no reason for an outside
driver to take an inner lane

  now came the starting shot the hun-
dred drivers entered and first drove a trial
lap each having a speedometer in his hand
the cars were of the most varied sorts

  at the very outside in the largest ring of
all bob was driving most of the field
glasses and the most inquisitive eyes were on
him

  that is the right hand man of the owner
of isabella

  bobs car was different from the others
not merely that it displayed in a golden
yellow brilliance the colors of isabella-but
that it was moved by a propeller placed at
the front this gave it a strange look and
called forth criticism the first lap was
ended and each driver had travelled the
same number of meters

  at the innermost lane don joao was driv-
ing his car he had got this place in the
drawing of lots and was satisfied with it

  lap after lap was covered there were
to be one hundred laps each ten kilometers
in length all was deathly still and a hun-
dred thousand people held their breath
nothing was to be heard but the sound of
the motors and the moving of the wheels-
not a word from anyone only when rock-
ets were sent up at the finish line and the
numbers of the cars victorious in each lap
were thrown in luminous writing against
the night sky was there a murmur through
the crowd

  the first elimination was over and noth-
ing untoward had happened there was a
sigh of relief from elsa dorn who was sit-
ting in extreme anxiety in the stand re-
served for the committee her hands clutch-
ing the rail her heart beating wildly

  luminous writing appeared in the sky


wonder stories

forty drivers had done equally well in the
first elimination don joao and bob were
among the forty positions were drawn for
again now the sixty outer rings stood
empty bob and joao were ten rings apart
once more the cars raced over the track
third race twenty drivers left

  the drivers were used up this time fif-
teen machines gave out during the race
fainting men lay in the stalls it was ex-
hausting work no changing of machines
was permitted

  another start this time there were only
four who came to the starting line

  final race don almeida of frisco
maclversen scotland louis aubert paris
bob white santa scientia

  don ferreira the president of puitu had
a pale face he could not get rid of the
idea that this almeida was his son joao
whom he knew to be living in frisco as an
auto racer

  the starting shot was fired and the four
cars sped along the track this broad track
of which only four rings were now rotating
the men sitting at the wheels were covered
with sweat-at least three of them for bob
still seemed as calm and unemotional as
ever

  joaos breast was heaving violently
every nerve of his body was tense and his
eyes were starting from the sockets

  in the midst of the course the frenchman
lost control of his car and it skidded but
now the excellence of this track was again
displayed in an instant before the car
could tip over it was seized by the distant
control and it stopped and the fainting
driver was carried out of the arena

only three cars left there were ten
laps to be done on the seventh mac-
lversen gave out hanging almost lifeless in
his car and was carried away

  two cars left just bob and don joao
they were alone on the track-driving with
perfect control everyone stood up a hun-
dred thousand people captured by feverish
excitement

  hurrah don almeida

  hurrah bob white

  at the ninth round bob hung back a

trifle so that don joao was a length ahead
joaos breast heaved his face deathly pale
yet the sweat ran from his brow for a
moment carried away by excitement he
forgot his intended collision

  now bob puts on full power and his car
seems to fly

  there is a cry from the stands a mad cry
from a hundred thousand throats the two
drivers side by side suddenly joao twists
his wheel and drives straight at bob in a
second a frightful thing is bound to occur
the two cars come together at a speed of
three hundred kilometers an hour has
joao gone crazy

  then-a miracle happens at both sides
of bobs car there emerges wings which had
been folded together like those of a butter-
fly they are slanted for rising the car
seems to rear up and rise into the air it
not merely leaps over the other car  it re-
mains in the air joaos car races up the
slope turns over and comes down on top
of the driver bob has risen in his strange
flying auto somewhat over the track he
dives into the middle of the lake and disap-
pears

  there was a moment of horrified excite-
ment

  he did it on purpose driving into him
  a villain

  a miserable murderer no sportsman
  but how could the auto fly

  didnt you see the wings which suddenly
sprouted

  an aerial auto

  where is bob white

  he is drowned in the lake

  search the lake 

  the crowd seemed ready to flood down
onto the track there was wild shouting
and shrieking

  suddenly there came from thousands of

vfilppq 

  look-there there

  they stared at the lake in reality hard-
ly two minutes had passed since the mad
leap the lake was stirred by waves-
there-the heavy car floated slowly it
came to shore

  an air water and land auto

  there were wild cries of jubilation
utopia island



  i

  isabella has won

  hurrah for santa scientia
t at one point an inclined plane led down
into the water nobody had noticed it
now the auto came up it onto the land it
was battered and dirty dripping with water
and weeds but bob was able to drive back
to the starting place though somewhat
slowly he got out and collapsed into the
arms of his friends

  elsa dorn sobbed and screamed hysteri-
cally   

   president ferreira was standing with ser-
 ious expression and bowed head by the
stretcher on which rested his son no
sportsman does such things slowly and
with weary steps he followed the stretcher
 again came a signal amid the shouting
of the spectators bob white again drove on-
to the track the shining golden car had
been cleaned again choosing a moderate
speed so that everyone could examine thor-
oughly the strange torpedo-car bob drove
it around the track then he put on speed
and raced around the track twice

beneath the earth

here was a cry of astonishment like
lightning something came out and un-
folded  the wings of a plane another
control was operated and the car-which
had become a plane-flew low so that all
might see around the track it rose went
lower did sideslips and then very gently
floated down on the great basin of water

  a ships propeller appeared a special
mechanism had covered the wheels of the
auto with plates of light beryllium this
had already happened during the flight and
these plates coming down obliquely closed
together and formed a keel

   the flying auto now become a motorboat
shot like lightning over the water while the
onlookers were wild with delight

  again the auto rose its keel was again
drawn in the plates went up and the pro-
peller vanished the car glided along the
track

  the jubilation became almost a pande-
monium but the loud speaker sounded above
everything else silence for bob white

  his voice was transmitted through many
loud speakers i declare mr maclversen
the winner of the auto race

  amazement and contradiction bob
wtiite is the winner

  no i am not it was an auto race but
i won it by changing my car into an air-
plane likewise don ferreira who is ser-
iously hurt has no right to the prize mac-
lversen was the last to give up maclver-
sen has won the prize of one hundred thou-
sand dollars -

  in this moment bob indeed had no idea
that maclversen was also one of the ass-
assins who had once attempted the life of
benjamin cook

  maclversen approached slowly staring at
bob and not understanding there was a
mighty shout not for the scotchman but
for bob who had won all their hearts by
declining the prize

  elsa dorn had left the arena when the
danger was past now she lay weeping in
grete hellings arms

	 

  in the general confusion no one had no-
ticed that while the racing was beginning a
black figure had sneaked softly onto the
stand in which mr cook was sitting the
intruders task was all the easier since cook
had declined to take a prominent part at
the festivity and was occupying a concealed
and curtained box alone

  the negro who was no other than sam
had sneaked in and was standing behind
cook he had already drawn a long dag-
ger when two sinewy arms seized hirjj
schliiter himself had observed him and had
followed him and now pulled him back at
the same time two powerful chinese thrust
a gag between his teeth and dragged him
away since all this took place just at the
time when joao tried to ram bobs car not
even cook noticed anything of what oc-
curred when the crowd was cheering
bob there was none to notice that some
chinese were carrying away a lengthy ob-
ject wrapped in blankets they took it to
a room which was equipped as a prison

  bob white with a victorious smile was
taking his car back into his garage

in the night sky there appeared over the


wonder stories

lake an inscription in an hour the swim-
ming matches begin

  as yet no one knew his way about in isa-
bella the crowd arose already accus-
tomed to follow blindly the directions of the
loud speakers they went down the grand-
stand steps the doors to the gliding bands
were shut but there stood open the gates of
elevators corresponding to the grandstand
exits

  a hundred entered each and were carried
down into the depths what did this mean
they had thought they would be carried to
the lake in the auto race track but now they
were being carried far down apparently
deep into the earth in isabella things were
always done differently than elsewhere

  the indicators on the doors of the eleva-
tors showed a drop of almost forty meters
when they stopped

  the spectators stepped out and were ex-
tremely surprised were they really in the
prosaic world or had they entered a fairy
land a monstrous body of water so large
that they could hardly see its limits spread
out before them but no sky was to be
seen for a vast grotto was arched over the
water yet it was not a uniform dome
they were rather in a huge cave whose roof
now extended to form a great dome

  the people who left the elevators in
throngs found themselves on islands in this
incredibly large grotto on every island
was a grandstand a circle of such artifi-
cial islands limited a part of the apparently
infinite lake in this gigantic cave and made
it a swimming racecourse

  bob and his friends now in tuxedos ac-
companied president ferreira and the guests
of honor the representatives of the league
of nations the special emissaries of ger-
many america england france and the
other great nations to a special stand of
honor erected in the middle of the lake

  the entire subterranean district was
lighted as bright as day without any source
of light being visible the brightness came
from above from the uppermost point of
the dome and everywhere as far as the eye
could reach into the distance light flooded
from concealed cracks and showed the in-

credible expanse of this cave and subterran-
ean lake

  president ferreira walked beside benja-
min cook for a few moments he had for-
gotten his injured son now being ban-
daged under the hands of the physicians and
dr frank like all the other guests he
was amazed by this underground marvel

  bob white said quietly gentlemen you
know that the dryness of these islands is
produced by the fact that the soil is too
permeable to retain the rain even in the best
watered districts the waters therefore col-
lect in a huge subterranean basin which we
have bored our way to and which you see
here

       chapter xxi
       more miracles

ashot resounded through the subter-
ranean hall the swimming meet had
begun the lake was incomparably splen-
did with the white gleaming stalactites and
tht reflection of the water on the grotto roof
now came a new surprise from the depths
below a seemingly unreal light shone up
over the water now red now blue now pale
green

  there were a hundred woman swimmers
who came on at the same time picked swim-
mers from all countries including notables
who had swum the english channel and the
straits of gibraltar elsa dorn from whose
breast a great weight had been removed and
whose heart was filled with a most extra-
ordinary sense of happiness was among the
six ladies who appeared in the golden yel-
low colors of santa scientia

  the bodies of the swimmers were not as
is usually the case covered with a thick
coating of grease giant electric heaters
which were located everywhere in the basin
had so raised the temperature of the water
that it was like a pleasant sea bath

  the signal sounded with a mighty leap
the girls began the race at first they were
almost all in a row then a cry of amaze-
ment came from every throat the six swim-
mers from isabella coming into the lead
utopia island



cut the water with their arms and shooting
almost ten meters ahead at every stroke

  a miracle

  that is incredible

  why nobody can do that

 a whispering and murmuring went
through the crowds while the other con-
testants struggled with all their might the
six shot across the water like arrows almost
as fast as a motorboat the first to reach
the shore was elsa dorn who was followed
shortly afterward by her companions al-
most at the same time not a hand stirred
to applaud the six stood smiling on the
shore resting and appearing perfectly fresh
while the real contest was being waged by
the other ninety-four a great inscription
was flashed over the water the six ladies
of isabella are not competing

  the signal sounded for the finish edith
ekklund who had already twice tried the
swim from gibraltar to africa emerged
from the water the winner she received
loud acclaim

  now all eyes were again turned to the six
isabella girls

  an exhibition by the six swimmers of
isabella

  they stood on a raised platform where
everyone could see them they were in
bathing suits with curious belts about their
waists and thousands of eyes viewed their
limbs

  they are hanging on a rope a number
remarked

  from each grandstand a spectator was in-
vited to the springboard no rope was to
be seen nor anything at all surprising

  a shot rang through the grotto the six
made a high dive into the water for a
moment they were all in a row then a
strange sport began they actually flew
through the water passing one another
they swam figures dove under one another
rose high up from the water and passed
over one another dove in again and carried
on play as unique as it was fairy-like at
the same time they swam without effort not
appearing to tire and when they bobbed up
from the waves they showed laughing faces

  the longer the game lasted the faster the
six sped through the water and the more

excited the crowd became yet no one
could understand it

  then the swimmers landed there was
endless applause they were not at all ex-
hausted but stood on the stand in their gold-
cclored robes and laughed

  the loud speaker announced more santa
scientia sport

  now ten young men stepped on the spring-
board also in the golden colors they
were muscular figures bare except for
swimming trunks they jumped into the
lake and repeated the play of the girls
only faster and more hazardously
impossible

  there is something wrong about it

  a miracle

  a loud speaker sounded through the hall
after the wave of excitement had lessened
and the swimmers were again on land

  a combination of strength and science
the water sport of the future each of the
swimmers wears a belt with the apparatus
necessary crude strength is not needed
skill plus science affords and opportunity
for unique pleasure in the water

  then real competition occurred and the
ladies and gentlemen of santa scientia
showed that they could outmatch the others
even without any mechanical aids such as
must have been on the belts they wore

  midnight the second part of the pro-
gram was also over assemble in the
arena tomorrow at ten oclock

again the grandstands emptied cars
stood ready they sped away through
subterranean roads everyone was full of
excitement after coming up in elevators
they reached a great open square of vast di-
mensions before them rose skyscrapers
gigantic houses of glass and iron with walls
of shining dull glass illuminated from with-
in by various colors the square itself was
surrounded by palms and lofty eucalyptus
trees gay flowers in handsome beds formed
the edge the square was entirely covered
with green turf

  the gentlemen of the league of nations
stood together they were still too much
excited to sit down at the table reserved for
them


wonder stories

  mr helling a word

  what is it sir

  what was that strange business with the
swimmers the flying machine was in-
geniously devised after all that would not
b impossible but the swimmers-was that
a fake

  absolutely not helling assured the
president

  what then

  perhaps not regular sport i agree but a
pastime if you wish

  well how is it done

  the swimmer wears under his suit next
to his body two concentric rings the in-
ner one is of lead and in this lead is em-
bedded radium a great number of wires
of a certain alloy very fine wires are sol-
dered together at the points reach into the
radium and come out from it in the form of
a w they come out of the lead ring and
are connected with coils with a spiral a
hundred at each end the second or outer
ring is filled with water and has holes ev-
erywhere

  the water cools the wires which come
from the radium producing an electric cur-
rent wrhich heats the spiral the water in
the second ring becomes steam which comes
out at the back and propels the swimmer
like a rocket while at the front a system
of very fine capillary tubes admits more
water the wires producing the current
consist alternately of antimony and bismuth
i think your excellency if you investigate
even this apparatus will no longer seem to
you to be a miracle

  shaking their heads the gentlemen went
to their tables which were placed in long
rows on the square

  each elevator which came up from the
bosom of the earth with guests had a num-
ber each table also no one had more than
a few steps to go they saw no persons to
direct them but each at once found the num-
ber of his seat

  a hundred thousand people were sitting
at these tables staring in amazement at the
finely shaded colored light of the glass
palaces in their centers the tables had a

rising section filled with food and drink a
cold supper which arose continually from
an invisible kitchen consisting of rare deli-
cacies while the hundred thousand ate and
drank yet amazed and speechless at the mar-
vels which encountered them in incessant
succession a tuneful music sounded from
some invisible source

  in the middle of the square was a stand
a shot rang out benjamin cook was now
standing up his voice amplified by loud
speakers called out over the square wel-
come my guests welcome to santa scientia
the city of knowledge and genius

  there was a cheer from the hundred thou-
sand people who thought they were dream-
ing as they stared up at the glass walls of
the houses at these waterfalls and at these
gardens high in the air they did not und-
erstand it all but only marvelled and joy-
fully attacked the delicacies which the dumb-
waiters brought them in inexhaustible
amount they felt as though they were part
of a story of some paradise in these hours
they suspected nothing of the work involved
in this undertaking

	 

  don ronaldo ferreira quietly entered the
hospital in which his son law that morn-
ing-the morning after the auto races-he
had expressed into the telephone the desire
to visit his son at once there appeared on
the glass plate the message in five min-
utes the car will be at your door

  there were no formalities in isabella
even for the president of puitu but there
was silent prevision and care it had been
torture for the president to have to attend
the swimming meet and the public dinner
afterward but during the swimming match
a light shone on the grandstand of the diplo-
mats and in a glass box which he had hith-
erto not noticed and which had also lighted
up was a letter for him

  he tore it open thinking he knew what
was in it perhaps it was his expulsion be-
cause of the crazy attempt of his son but
in it was a quite different message oper-
ation successful don joao out of danger
visit not possible until tomorrow dr
frank
utopia island



ferreira and cook

only now it occurred to him that bob
himself had conducted him to his seat
charmingly and in perfect equanimity not
at all like a man whose murder had been
attempted by the son of his guest

  the hospital lay in the midst of a great
park which extended over the roofs of the
whole city though it gave the impression of
lying on level ground on a hill in a fine
palm grove

  it was a hot day even the artificial
clouds which were always above the city
could not check the heat but scarcely had
the open car come near the hospital when a
pleasantly cooling breeze played about fer-
reira large noiseless ventilators blew a
current of strongly ozonized ice-cooled air
toward the building which cooled the air to
make a comfortable mild wind

  refreshed ferreira breathed easier and
went up the few marble steps there was
no one here though to be sure he was ex-
pected

  in the anteroom stood dr frank who
responded seriously and evenly to his greet-
ing things have gone well compound
fracture of arm and leg but fortunately no
injury to the brain if the wounds have re-
mained quite without infection it is due to
our air which is practically free from bac-
teria

  doctor you have saved my sons life by
the operation

  frank did not take the presidents hand
i did my duty there is the room

  may i speak to my son

  he is entirely free from fever

  ferreira entered joao lay there very
pale and wrapped in bandages he looked
at his father with a perplexed gloomy
glance ferreira took a seat by the bed
and silently looked at his son for a long
time he was happy and at the same time
sad

  finally joao broke the silence it is no
use it would have been better if i had
died

  shame on you joao

because i failed or because i am alive

  because you could resolve on such a
thing

  i hate this man i hate isabella i
hate     since joao had come out of
the delirium of fever he had again per-
suaded himself that he had risked his life
not for himself but for puitu this weak
character who fluctuated between noble as-
piration boundless ambition and greed
was now pleased to play the part of a martyr
to his country

  fool that you are we should never
have found that gold and if we really had
discovered it it would long ago have been
spent but here something has been created
which all the world can look at with satis-
faction and pride but you my son have
a second time become a criminal one of
your aims you have attained i shall resign
today the forty years of endeavor your
father has given to his country are wiped
out by one act of his son did you want
to save your country you have injured
it most terribly it is your fault that i must
beg mr cook for your life

  no never sooner    joao act-
ed as though he wanted to tear off his ban-
dages

  then the father weakened i forgive you
get well and come with me i feel that this
man who provides the best physicians in the
world to save the life of an assassin will be
generous enough not to destroy me entirely
give me your word that you want to get well
and begin a new life

  joao remained silent now the great pain
of his father was not without an impression
or him you rejected me

  recover and stand at my side perhaps
it will be believed that you acted from noble
motives in san francisco you were at
least a man who faced life i have always
kept my eye on you and now also i will
care for you

  ferreira knelt down beside the bed that
was the only way in which it was possible
for him to embrace his son then he silent-
ly went out got in the car again and went
back to the hotel

	 

  may i see the president of santa scien-
tia


wonder stories

   the telephone replied mr cook is wait-
ing for the president of puitu

   it was the most difficult step of don fer-
reiras life to now enter the elevator which
was to take him to cook

  he entered the large chamber a great
room full of bookcases in which the maker
of santa scientia was sitting at his desk
and performing his duties just as calmly this
day as any other

   twelve corridors arranged radially left
this room one led to the great station the
others to the offices of the officials each
section of the building surrounding this
main office was filled with automatic regis-
tering and secretarial devices

cook arose and came to meet his guest
mister president faltered ferreira

  if you please simply benjamin cook
there are no titles in santa scientia

   mr cook as president of puitu and as
as an unhappy father i have to beg your
pardon for the fact that my son in misdirect-
ed patriotism has a second time been in-
volved in a damnable crime

  cook looked at him calmly i know of
nc crime

  my son    

  say no more president you know as
well as i that an attack with ineffectual
means is not punishable no one was in
danger besides we were prepared for such
a thing our means of protection are in-
vincible and i simply did not think it worth
while to take cognizance of dangers per-
haps i am more to blame than your son i
knew what must happen i have blamed
myself that it might have caused his death
if i had warned him it would not have been
necessary to demonstrate the invincible might
of santa scientia but i had to risk his
life to keep all others from hasty acts be
glad that all happened thus and be silent
about it it is past and i shall never refer
to it again

chapter xxii
the play goes on

it was a difficult moment for ferreira
there he stood the representative of pui-

tu and had to receive a gift from the hand
of mr cook he knew that this gift was
no sign of weakness and felt that this man
was generous enough to forgive an attempt
at murder

  cook however felt with his guest and sus-
pected his thoughts without knowing them
he rose again and said in an unconcerned
manner let us be glad that your son is
recovering from the accident it is too bad
that it robbed him of the otherwise richly
deserved prize i think you will not want
to miss the great soccer match and the in-
ternational gymnastic competition please
excuse me until then i intend to take part
in the gymnastics myself and first i have
some pressing matters to settle

  ferreira bowed and went to his car again
he had a feeling of humility yet he could
not help being grateful to this man who ad-
dressed him not the president of a great
nation but as man to man a charge
brought against his son for attempted mur-
der during the games would have cost fer-
reira his position the proud grandee si-
lently abased himself to cook and left the
room

  in the great soccer field outside the city
a hundred thousand spectators were waiting
no there were only ninety thousand for
ten thousand of those who yesterday had
been spectators were now down on the field
as representatives of the different clubs of
the world ten thousand players at the same
time the arena was an immense half-cir-
cle an expanse divided into ten smaller
fields and in each field a thousand players
were to meet five hundred on a side eng-
land against germany france against in-
dia belgium against south africa the uni-
ted states against australia italy against
holland brazil against norway sweden
against argentina denmark against spain
mexico against hungary czechoslovakia
against canada

  twenty nations had each sent its five hun-
dred best soccer players only isabella itself
was not represented the playing surface
was peculiar a mighty sheet of metal cov-
ered with a rough leather layer so that the
players might not slip in each of the ten
fields which together composed the whole
utopia island



expanse stood the two goals with the jud-
ges stands in the middle of each a great
glass wall separated the spectators from the
field of play but it was a wall of optically
polished glass which had a magnifying ef-
fect without using field glasses one could
lcok over the whole of this immense field
from any place in the stands

  the starting signal was fired at the
same time ten thousand muscular young
forms rushed toward their opponents each
of the goal-tenders was a noted player
above the field hung dense artificial clouds
ventilators here also blew a cooling wind
every time one of the teams made a goal
the flag of the scoring country appeared in
shining colors in the sky while loud speak-
ers announced the scores it was a match
such as the world had never seen

  then another shot was heard ten nations
had won after half an hour there were
to be return matches to settle the final vic-
tories and then the ten winners were to
play one another until the championship
was settled

  again a giant writing appeared the
men of santa scientia will play but not in
competition there were only a hundred
players but the hosts scorned to compete
for prizes the hundred almost were lost
t view in the middle of the vast field at
first it seemed to be an ordinary game in-
deed on the part of good players but noth-
ing extraordinary the spectators were al-
most disappointed they had already be-
come accustomed to seeing amazing and
wonderful things

  a new starting signal was fired sudden-
ly the men divided fifty withdrawing to one
end of the great oval fifty to the other

  questioning murmurs arose were these
hundred men going to play over the entire
monstrous field which was several kilo-
meters in extent

  there was no time to think about it again
a shot was fired the ball flew into the air
with one of the players after it a kick-
and there was another miracle  the ball
shot high up several hundred meters above
the field came to the ground and like
lightning the players sped behind it far

faster than a man could run another kick
-six hundred meters

  this was quite unbelievable again the
almost flying men appear now they are
at the enemy a gargantuan struggle is go-
ing on like the war of giants men go at
automobile speed over the field kicks soar
half a kilometer high through the air

a wild and yet regulated rushing to and
fro ensues the whole fild belongs
to the hundred players after half an hour
of struggle the victory is decided one side
has won the hundred players stand to-
gether smiling

  an illusion

  a deception by means of motion pic-
tures  

  some kind of swindle

  a second time the teams come on a
second entirely similar contest takes place
on one of the grandstands helling is beside
van rhyn how is that possible asked
the latter

  very simple it is the result of our ef-
for to make science serviceable to sport
it is not to replace human courage but it is
to give it greater aim wasnt it a fine
spectacle to see these young men rushing
across the field and to see the ball travel

a though hurled by a giants foot

  quite right but how is it done

  the field consists of metal and is made
into a single electric field by a great num-
ber of built-in electromagnets since the
field is divided in two parts the electric
pulling force goes from both side toward
the middle and as on a backgammon board
the projections of the field extend in each
case far into the opponents field

  each player has a boot with a split cop-
per lining and a system of wires ending at
a contact in his belt now if the player
runs over the field without switching on this
contact then it does not affect him and it
is the same as though he were playing on an
ordinary field but if at the moment his
boot meets the ball he puts in the switch
and closes the circuit then he is immediate-
ly pulled forward by the electric field the
impact of the human foot muscles is multi-


wonder stories

plied a hundred times and the ball flies an
immense distance

  the player who wishes to follow it
glides after it on one foot which by means
of the switched-on copper shoe acts like a
motorcar believe me great practice and
much skill are needed for this the player
must close the contact at the right moment
and must know when playing in the oppon-
ents territory exactly where are the strips
of the electric field which impel him for-
ward if he gets on the wrong track so to
speak then he is in the same instant seized
by the reverse force and hurled backward
we had many a bad fall and many a broken
bone before our players learned the game
but see the eyes of the men they have the
sense of being giants even electricity can
serve sport

  in a flash the great arena was covered
with gymnastic apparatus ten thousand
young men and women came on for gym-
nastics again the colors of all countries
were represented the dancing games were
splendid as were the exercises with wands
and the rhythmic dances which were exe-
cuted in perfect unison by ten thousand
beautifully developed bodies at the orders
of the loud speaker

  at first all the countries in the world
joined in this mighty display of rhythm and
then the crowd divided into groups hun-
dreds made mighty leaps with long poles
others threw the javelin and the discus while
still others performed on the bars or the
hcrse or made giant pyramids in their native
colors pictures of strength and beauty

  in the center an elevated platform arose
on it were a number of horizontal bars now
ten young men stepped up who wore the
colors of santa scientia before each bar
was a slope leading down to the bar and at
the upper end of the slope was a platform
on which the men stood

  again a shot rang out the ten ran down
the slopes jumped high and clutched the
bars in the underhold of course at once
they began a lightning giant swing which
kept them whirling around the bars again
and again in endless circles at high speed

  the bars are turned by a motor

  that is no art that is not really sport

  on the contrary it requires tremendous
strength to counterbalance with the muscles
of the arms this mighty centrifugal force

  with mighty swings which sent them far
from the bars the ten gymnasts at the same
time let go turned beautiful somersaults
and stood upright side by side though with
red flushed faces

a strange visitor

the games went on again the lake be-
low was brightly illuminated this
time there was a wide course through subter-
ranean tunnels and mighty stalactite grottos
where the crews of oxford and cambridge
competed for the championship with those of
germany france america and other coun-
tries

  then followed the sailboat competition in
a strong wind of course it was an artifi-
cial storm mechanically produced which
blew across the lake which was ashine with
many-colored lights

  meanwhile the race course was prepared
again on the surface this time it was not
autos but three thousand jockeys from all
over the world speeding around the track
on the finest horses again the bands
moved and each had only the same distance
to cover

  again the great arena filled up this
time the lake in the middle into which bob
had plunged with his car had vanished
instead there shone there in spite of the
heat of the sun a smooth white sheet of
ice thousands of skilled skaters of all
countries displayed their art nearby on a
grassy meadow the worlds championship
in tennis was settled while skillful riders
were racing over the turf in a polo game
not far away

  the visitors were taken through the city
in groups through the green streets between
the palaces of glass they saw the cycling
roads the illuminated auto roads the rail-
ways which extended far out and the ex-
press lines lower down a hundred thou-
sand persons were impressed by the might
of this city and felt that they had been
transported to fairyland
utopia island



  while the guests were still sitting at the
long tables which again on this second eve-
ning were lavishly supplied with all the deli-
cacies in the world mr cook was at hi
office to get a telephonic report from mr
moller he looked up and started involun-
tarily now as many weeks before when
the surprise attack on him had occurred a
man had silently entered

  although cook recognized in his present
visitor the scotchman maclversen who had
received the first prize the day before in the
auto racing he felt reminded of one of the
would-be assassins of that former visit it
was also incomprehensible to him how mac-
lversen could have got in here unannounced
at a time when schlliter had special police
a his disposal he turned to the man if
i am not mistaken you are mr maclver-
sen

  yes sir and i beg your pardon for in-
truding here i must ask you to listen to
me quite alone

  there was something strangely determined
about the man around his mouth a hard
line was unmistakably present every mo-
ment he looked more and more like one of
the three former intruders yet he did not
give the impression of planning any harm
he rather seemed to be suffering from some
strong emotion

  cook pointed invitingly to a seat how
can i serve you we are alone

  it is about the prize which was given me
yesterday

  cook was amazed isnt everything all
right didnt you receive the check the
hundred thousand dollars will be paid you
immediately in frisco in cash or are you
short of money and would you prefer bills
the scotchman looked down and said
hesitatingly all my life i have been a
poor devil and i never let myself dream
that a person could honorably win a hun-
dred thousand dollars a hundred thou-
sand dollars that is wealth that is    
cook smiled then i am the more
pleased that you won the prize

  maclversen stood up and now appeared
completely decided though his face was
very pale mr cook i cannot take the
piize i herewith return you the check

  cook was amazed but why you de-
served it for mr white with his flying auto
was not in the competition of course and
mr almeida was disqualified so you won
without a question

  still i cannot accept it continued the
scotchman

  but why

  because i am a scoundrel because i
came here not to compete honorably but-
he groaned and sank again into the chair

  cook seemed to see a veil fall you
have come to confide something in me we
are entirely alone speak frankly and i
tell you beforehand you are no scoundrel
or else you would not be here before me
now

  the scotchman straightened up and look-
ed fixedly at cook do you know who i
am

  at this moment cook understood you
are the scotchman macgonnor who tried to
murder me eight weeks ago

  you know that

  i just recognized you

  then you will understand that a man
who came to santa scientia to steal and
who was ready a second time to commit a
crime cannot accept the prize take the
check and do as you wish with me

  cook looked at him how strange are
the ways of fate you came with dark pur-
poses perhaps your conscience would not
have troubled you if you had taken by
force what you have now honorably earned
now your conscience is awake mr mac-
gonnor i will hear nothing of your inten-
tions or whether you were in league with
that unhappy young man who lies in the
hospital

  travel away happily mr macgonnor
take the check which you have honestly
earned and if you want to take with you a
bit of advice for the whole of your life do
not squander this money become a good
man i will ask mr moller in frisco to
help you to invest this money so you may
live on the income

  use this money to become a useful mem-
ber of humanity and if i ever hear that you
have fulfilled this wish of mine then i shall


wonder stories

be convinced that the first prize awarded
by santa scientia has done real good
macgonnor did not reply he sat in the
chair with his hands over his face sobbing
be a man

  the scotchman straightened up and-
my crime

  no one knows of it but you and i it
was no crime for neither formerly nor now
have you carried it out thank god for
that and now become a good man

       chapter xxiii
       hate and despair

at this moment dr schliiter entered and
looked in surprise at the two

  cook said with a smile mr maclversen
considered it necessary to thank me again
for his well deserved prize good-bye mr
maclversen i shall be glad to hear good
news of you

  macgonnor was unable to answer but
cook could not prevent the mans kissing
his hand before macgonnor left with the
cheek his steps unsteady as though he were
now experiencing a real miracle

  he walked through the streets and sat all
night in his room sunk in thought the
macgonnor who finally stepped out into
the streets full of people holding his head
high was now seeing and understanding
clearly his whole soul was filled with sac-
red emotions

  cook looked at schliiter have you
something to report to me doctor

  now for the first time schliiter told of
the murderous attack of the negro and his
imprisonment

  cook nodded that was to be expected
i think i know everything now let us say
no more about it this negro is certainly
the cause of all the trouble

  what is to be done with him

  cook reflected i do not know myself
and the question is hard to answer as yet
we are actually nothing we are not an in-
dependent state and do not know how the
league of nations will act on our applica-
tion a week ago no one could have pre-
vented our doing as we wished now we

must observe public opinion but let us
not disturb these fine days with such mat-
ters

  yet we cannot  schliiter began

  keep the man in custody nothing has
happened but we must protect ourselves
from any repetitions when the festive days
are past we shall see is there anything
else

  nothing everything has gone on per-
fectly

  cook considered formerly there had
been three men in league with the negro
two of them were now here with him the
third-was it don christobal should he
ask about him then he could not help
bringing to light macgonnor and don joao
and the entire conspiracy thank you
doctor i think the negro whom you locked
up will harm us no longer

  the criminologist left he could not
help agreeing that cook could hardly have
acted otherwise and that it was in any event
clever of him not to disturb the festive joy
by the news of an attempted crime sam
was secured in the rocky cave with a great
iron gate guarding the entrance

  dr schliiter went out again to make a
nightly tour through the city of isabella
he now had a chinese band on guard in the
central building in case of emergencies he
really did not understand how it had been
possible for the scotchman maclversen to
reach cook without being seen by his watch
yet it was possible that cook himself had
sent for the man by his own car of the
connection between don joao the negro
sam and the scotchman he of course knew
nothing

  schliiter had scarcely left the main build-
ing when he encountered dr frank

  i was looking for you doctor said the
latter

  have you observed anything special

  i must speak to you alone

  frank had a serious face they went
back into the building and entered one of
the consultation rooms

  what has happened

  nothing fortunately but i consider it
my duty to tell you my observations you
utopia island



know i operated on this almeida who is
actually the son of the president of puitu
yes i know

  at first he was delirious and raved
one cannot put much stock in such ravings
of course and besides it is the duty of a
physician to keep still about them yet
some strange things came out in this con-
fused raving it seems that there was a
conspiracy in which a negro sam a scotch-
man macgonnor and a certain don christo-
bal had parts there were also some un-
recognizable names i know nothing defin-
ite since mr cook has determined out of
consideration for the president of puitu
that don joaos murderous attack is to be
regarded as an accidental skid we can do
nothing i simply ask you to look out for
this negro and those other two persons
whom i of course did not know were in isa-
bella and to do so without disturbing mr
cook

schluter nodded here is a confi-
dence in return this negro attempted
at the moment of the intended collision to
murder mr cook i came in time to arrest
him and to jail him unobtrusively

  and the other two

  i knew nothing of them and i shall
double my watchfulness

	 

  during these days there was one man who
did not share in the general joy in santa
scientia this was the chilean planter
serao argonza under whose name christo-
bal was a guest of the festival during the
auto racing which he had refused to take
part in he had sat apparently uninterested

  when the deciding race occurred he had
jumped up with the others in the general
excitement and had managed to stand al-
most directly opposite the site of the colli-
sion but when bob emerged from the ac-
cident quite unharmed and joao was car-
ried away badly hurt he made himself in-
conspicuous again and watched all the more
keenly the box in which sam was to kill mr
cook that also had failed and christobal
swore when he saw that it was mr cook
who awarded the prize to the scotchman
macgonnor

  christobal wandered around and paid no
attention to the sports he looked for mac-
gonnor but could not find him sam also
was not to be seen had he really made
the attempt on cook had he been cap-
tured christobal became uneasy at ev-
ery moment he felt a sword hanging over
his head

  timidly he looked at each of the chinese
police and at the same time he was in-
wardly full of hate and rage probably
joao was dead but macgonnor had a hun-
dred thousand dollars why should chris-
tobal actually steal perhaps sam had hid-
den himself and was stealing on his own
account and he christobal was every
moment in danger of being arrested for
he did not know what joao might have be-
trayed he had no opportunity to leave the
island and he had no money he was full
of hate for macgonnor full of greed full
of despair

  it was night the same hour in which the
hundred thousand guests were eating for the
first time at the tables christobal was also
hungry perhaps hungrier than any of the
others for in his excitement at the impend-
ing blow at cook he had not eaten any-
thing yet he would not have ventured to
sit at the festive table of isabella he went
out into the night walking along the shore
glad to be alone constantly he saw the
light of the searchlights which swept over
the whole island and the sea he sat down
on a stone and reflected something had
to be done his coming here could not
be useless but what could he do should
he steal table silver ridiculous or
commit a purposeless murder just to still
his inner wrath

  good evening senor

  christobal started-and then looked into
sams face

  quick come with me the negro seized
his hand and climbed down the cliff with
him down close to the water while the
searchlights swung away in here

  christobal forced his way into a crack
in the rock it was perfectly dark but now
a small lamp lighted up in the negros hand
and through a narrow winding path they


wonder stories

arrived at a cave which seemed to be equip-
ped with all possible food and supplies

  sam grinned this is my domain if
the asses of isabella ever dreamed that i
live so near the city these fools-this
doctor who came at the last moment when
i was going to kill cook and locked me
up as though i did not know all these
grottos and passages better than they no-
body knows that out of the cave before
which they put a lock fit for a bank vault
a very narrow and excellently hidden pas-
sage leads into the open and that the bird
had flown out again before his jailers reach-
ed the supper table

  now the negro was entirely changed he
brought out all sorts of delicacies and some
strong wine and told about the failure of the
attack on cook

  christobal took one of the thick-bellied
wine bottles and drank down its contents
in greedy haste

  not so fast sir we must keep our
heads clear

 why so now

  because tonight we are going to visit
the inca treasure vault

  christobal was electrified what about
macgonnor

  sam laughed a man who has a hun-
dred thousand dollars does not need to steal
never mind him here is my plan bob
white does not stay at the table he is too
much excited every evening he walks for
several hours by the shore we will watch
for him

  and what if he does not come

  then we will wait until the next night
it will not matter

in the cave of the incas

a half hour later the two were crouch-
ing between the rocks christobal had
to recognize the negro as the leader he
himself lay between the stones while sam
sneaked about on the watch

  hours passed still the enchanted light
lay over isabella and the murmuring of the
hundred thousand people still discussing
eagerly the events of the day blended with
the roar of the waves these were hours

in which every nerve in christobals body
quivered suddenly he started sam was
standing beside him whispering here he

comes

  alone

  bob white is always alone we will not
kill him one never knows how such a
thing comes out he does not know you
i will give the signal until then you lie
out of sight then jump up pull off your
shoes run silently behind him pull him
down and ill be there at once i have
what we will need then

  sam vanished and it seemed to christo-
bal that he heard approaching footsteps

  the hoarse cry of an iguana sounded the
signal agreed on

  christobal sprang up he saw a man
standing on the shore looking out to sea
it was bob white

  an instant later there was a brief cry
bob lay on the ground sam knelt on him
and pressed a cloth to his face and bob no
longer stirred

  the chloroform is acting now be
quick

  bob was tied up and a gag was put in his
mouth

  the men hurried to the city now sam
was wearing bobs suit and he had a pair of
blue spectacles on his nose christobal fol-
lowed him at some distance imitating the
gait of a rather intoxicated person and even
passing a police watch the negro managed
to get into hiding places and to escape being
seen

  here sam pointed to a little back en-
trance they were in the dark but they
knew they were fairly high up since they
were on the level of the streets for pedes-
trians sam evidently knew his way per-
fectly he opened a door and they enter-
ed an elevator silently they went down
and reached the lowest story of all they
listened all was quiet here carefully
keeping to the walls they hurried on

  here these stairs

  they stood in a little grotto with the
mighty iron gate of the treasure chamber
before them sam turned a few switches

  careful now for heavens sake i have
not spied here for days in vain i am shut-
utopia island



ting off the electric alarm sam drew out
the key which he had taken from bob i
even know the keyword

  again they listened a short time then
the lock turned and the great door opened

  once more they listened for almost a
quarter of an hour the two stood holding
their breath it was after all possible that
there were still other signals of which sam
knew nothing yet this was evidently not
the case in santa scientia they obviously
did not consider the possibility that robbers
might come

  they entered the vault and pulled the
door to the flashlight shone on treasures
which nearly dazzled them on stands there
were the finest works of the art of the in-
cas there were great heaps of shining
ingots of gold in large boxes were pre-
cious jewels

  the intruders were actually intoxicated
with greedy hands they seized the valuables
and stuffed their pockets

then they came out again with beating
hearts they listened and thought they
heard steps voices-the watch

  quickly sam switched on again the alarm
bells then the two crouched close to-
gether in a corner covering themselves with
some old sacks that were there

  a man came and examined the locks and
the bells all in order some chinese
guards passed very close to them so close
that the men in hiding felt the impact of
their feet then it became quiet again
still they remained lying there for some
time then they hurried back the way they
had come

  how shall we get through the city with
this full sack

  sam chose a different route they reach-
ed one of the subterranean rooms in which
the autos were kept they got on one and
went noiselessly as all the machines in isa-
bella did along the now deserted speedway
soon they were out in the open far outside
the city only the fact that the negro had
been able to study the layout for months
made the escape possible

  when morning dawned christobal and
sam were again in their hiding place count-

ing the spoils then they emptied bottle
after bottle of strong wine and fell intoxi-
cated on the blankets with which their cave
was covered

	 

  that night dr schliiter did not sleep
with elsa dorn who was glad to help him
he again compared all the sailing lists
almeida and maclversen were properly an-
nounced as members of the california rac-
ing club of sam he found nothing then
elsa dorn said i do not understand here
i a chilean planter serao argonza the
name is unknown to me and it does not oc-
cur in the lists which i received of guests
from chile

perhaps he has made an exchange

  or this argonza is don christobal
the devil it almost seems to me as
though dr frank mentioned a name like
that

  which room

  

  an hour later the doctor already had his
information the room of the chilean had
not been used and he had been neither at
the festive supper nor at the dance his
chair had been empty at meals he had at-
tended the auto racing but nothing else

  schliiter nodded this person is don
christobal we must have him he is hid-
den on the island

  while the hundred thousand guests were
sleeping in their rooms dreaming of the
wonders they had experienced armed pat-
rols were searching the whole island

chapter xxiv
last hours

anew day dawned in great groups
the guests were conducted through the
streets but not into the work-rooms it
would have been quite impossible to give
such a throng of visitors a real insight into
the scientific work of santa scientia

  at noon the conclusion of the sport fes-
tival took place in the great arena in
which the auto racing had occurred there
were now a hundred planes ready to fly
they were strange machines some quite like


wonder stories

the ordinary planes others with the propel-
lei on top and still others with no propel-
ler at all but the strangest thing was that
there was no flier in any one of these planes
ir the center of the arena on a platform
set high above the middle of the lake stood
a great mechanism like a gigantic typewrit-
er

  vetter himself now took his place at the
keyboard the starting shot sounded and
the loud speaker announced the air man-
euvers are beginning which exhibit the re-
mote control system of santa scientia

  it almost looked as though mr vetter
were playing the piano but each touch of
a key resulted in a marvel the planes left
the ground some describing wide circles
others with the propeller on top flying
straight up from the ground then there
began in the air over the heads of the
breathless spectators a mad game in
squadrons the planes shot toward one an-
other and seemed about to collide at the
last instant they stood still in the air flew
uider one another did bold trick flying
and executed a wild dance in the air while
the giant loudspeakers gave forth loud mus-
ic

  to the music of a jazz band they raced
past one another so that they looked like
an inextricable swarm of flies they hover-
ed to the tones of a waltz formed in battle
squadrons to the melody of a military
march and rocked to the melting harmonies
of an orchestra of violins

  if at first many were anxious lest at any
moment planes might have accidents and
fall on their heads the perfect security of
these maneuvers soon afforded a tremen-
dous spectacle and the manner in which one
man at his keyboard moved all the planes
as though by electric connecting wires
like the marionettes of a childrens theatre
produced tremendous enthusiasm

  this too came to an end obediently the
hundred planes descended and stood in or-
der as before the flying

  a new starting signal sounded this time
ten planes without propellers rose into the
air apparently they were moved by mag-
netic forces sent out by a number of large

zeppelins these could be seen high up in
the air above the arena

  again the loud speaker made itself heard
the rocket ships the future travellers of

space

  from the exhausts of these planes which
to be sure were operated by pilots shot fire
and they began to circle faster and even
faster already after a few seconds noth-
ing more could be seen but ten fiery circles
speeding above the arena at a velocity sur-
passing comprehension the circles went
through one another forming all sorts of
geometrical figures and plainly showed
that even rocket planes were perfectly con-
trollable by these pilots

  a shot sounded again the rocket ships
now came down in perfect order

  the loud speaker called out this ends
the sport festival of santa scientia dinner
begins in an hour and embarking starts at
four oclock at eight the last guest will
have left santa scientia it is at present not
possible to give consent to the thousands of
requests to immigrate here for now the
meeting is over santa scientia thanks the
thirty-five different nations of the earth for
coming here each of these nations is re-
quested to select from its numbers five
representatives-a member of the govern-
ment a newspaper man a scholar an in-
dustrial leader and an engineer santa
scientia will ask these gentlemen to remain
a few days as guests now that the time
of the great games is past we will show the
chosen ones as well as the representatives
of the league of nations our serious work
and explain and demonstrate the economic
and cultural significance of santa scientia

the embarkation commenced there
were thousands of disappointed faces
but mr cook remained inexorable all ex-
cept the chosen must go the departure
took place in the same fashion as the land-
ing three days before again the entire sea
around the half forgotten iguana islands
was covered with veritable fleets on them
were people who still thought they had been
dreaming who did not comprehend what
they had experienced in these few days and
felt that they were returning from another
utopia island



world into the ordinary prosaic universe

  never before had the ships radios been
so busy they were used constantly by the
representatives of governments and by news-
paper reporters for nobody had been al-
lowed to telegraph from isabella

  at eight in the evening helling announced
from cabo martino ninety-nine thousand
eight hundred and thirty-three guests to-
gether with the cooks and waiters have left
santa scientia there have remained be-
hind one hundred and seventy-five repre-
sentatives of the thirty-five nations also
don almeida don serao argonza of chile
and the envoys of the league of nations
almeida who was in reality don joao
was still in the hospital president fer-
reira of puitu who did not want to leave his
son was among the government representa-
tives

  

  dr schliiter entered cooks room

  do you know doctor what has become
of bob i have not seen him all day

  i have something very serious to an-
nounce to you mr white is at present in
prof weigands clinic

  cook sprang up has he been hurt
seriously hurt

  he will be all right tomorrow i have
performed my duty badly last night mr
white was found by one of my patrols on a
lonely shore road he had been robbed of
his clothes attacked and chloroformed
was this done by our guests
certainly not don christobal who
sneaked into our city under the name of
serao argonza is the perpetrator-he and
the negro sam who in some inexplicable
manner escaped from the locked jail
incredible

  i also found out about maclversen whose
real name is macgonnor it seems to me
impossible that he took part in the attack
s i let him go it has come out that the
two robbers got into the treasure vault by
means of the key which mr white was car-
rying

  did they steal anything

  at a rough estimate half a million dol-
lars worth of jewels

  and the criminals

  they can under no possibility have left
the island i had the checks doubled at the
departure besides i know that from the
moment i saw macgonnor talking with you
urtil his departure on the first steamer he
left his room only in company with mr
moller who arrived in isabella yesterday
it has actually turned out that mr mac-
gonnor is a remote relative of mr moller
he is accordingly cleared of complicity in
the attack

  i know

  mr cook had already talked with mol-
ler had told him the entire macgonnor
affair and had asked him to do his best
for the man

  what is to be done now

  it is proved that the two criminals can-
not have left the island it is quite impos-
sible that they have got by the guards be-
sides when i arrested the negro sam after
the attempted murder he remarked with a
scornful laugh that he had lived on the is-
land for months

we must talk with the gentlemen who
made our electric plants it must be
strange if electricity which can do anything
cannot procure us these criminals as well
what do you think

  i dont think anything i simply have
an idea just as formerly i imagined that it
must be possible to build an auto to go in
the water on the ground and in the air
then grotefendt planned and built it now
i imagine that it must be possible to smoke
out criminals from the crannies of an is-
land how that can be done is a matter
for the engineers

  do not grow any grey hairs doctor
you could not count on such matters and
as long as the stolen property is still on our
island it is not lost perhaps it would be
well to interview don joao cautiously ev-
en if he was not present himself he may per-
haps know something about the negro sams
hiding places

the end of a career

mr cook had a talk with president
ferreira and then asked the latter to
accompany him to don joaos bed


wonder stories

  in front of the hospital dr frank was
waiting for him i have very sad news for
you 

  a new misfortune

  during the last festivities the attendant
left don joaos room and he took advan-
tage of the moment to electrocute himself
there is no doubt that his touching a high
voltage wire was intentional

  ferreira looked fixedly at the doctor un-
able to speak

  he left this letter the latter went on
there were only a few words forgive
me father this is the best way for you
for me and for puitu

  for a moment the old gentleman stood
horror-struck and covered his face with his
hand then he straightened up and said
perhaps he is right with firm steps he
approached the couch on which the dead
don joao had been laid out of respect to
his father it had been decorated with palms
and orchids

  for a long time the old man stood in
silent thought then he said my son was
a very gifted man he could have helped
his native land now i must thank him and
especially you that i can take him home
honorably i should like to leave today if
you will be so kind as to provide me with an
airship

  gladly your excellency only much
as i respect your feelings i must ask you
for another interview first

  ferreira was again sunk in the contempla-
tion of his dead son in an hour i shall
be ready for you now let me have some
moments to collect myself

  while the old president remained by the
bed of his dead son cook and his compan-
ions went into the consultation room of the
hospital

  don joao has shown himself courageous
after all that had happened it was the only
way out he took this course bravely it
seems to me a proof that the young man
in spite of his excessive ambition and un-
bridled passions had decency in him he
had no part in the theft

  at cooks wish the engineers were tele-
phoned and in a short time they were as-

sembled about him also the two professors
van rhyn and vetter

  there was a long conultation and it end-
ed only when president ferreira asked for
mr cook

  then the two gentlemen sat together for
a long time ferreira had become entirely
composed by the time the zeppelin rose into
the air in the dead of night with the quick-
ly-prepared coffin of don joao as well as
the president of puitu on board he even
held his head high again finally he turned
to the pilot who at his request was accom-
panying the airship have you a wireless
on board

  may i ask you to send a telegram to
washington

  surely

  ferreira wrote a few lines on the paper
situation changed puitu no longer needs
american money wish to withdraw from
the negotiations

  the statesman had taken the place of the
father and ferreira was glad that he could
disarm the greatest reproach which his ene-
mies uttered that he was delivering pui-
tu over to the united states

  meanwhile mr cook had returned to his
room by no means showing the face of a
man who has lost a half million dollars

      chapter xxv
      thieves fall out

now the guests were conducted about
first they went into the completed
buildings and into the workshops in which
the individual industries were being oper-
ated to the accompaniment of industrial
music

  then there was explained to the visitors
the operation of the central building the
railroads the auto roads and the cycling
streets they were shown the colors of the
glass walls and their ability to let through
all the sunlight without absorbing the vital
rays finally they went into the natural
park into the artificially cultivated places
and into the great plant for the sterilization
of air and into the clinics at alesia here
there were especially interesting things to
utopia island



be seen for of course so many sport acti-
vities could not go on without injuries

  dr frank who now felt himself com-
pletely an alesian proudly displayed his
invalids one had had a new knee joint put
in to replace his own which had been
smashed in an automobile accident anoth-
er even had a new kidney a third had
received a new collar-bone from the col-
lection of live parts possessed by dr weig-
and

  you see the immense importance of
blood tests explained frank when ev-
ery boy and girl say at the second school
vaccination has a blood test taken and the
group of blood types is registered then the
work of doctors will be greatly lessened in
the case of illness

  dr schliiter who was present nodded
the work of the criminologists also if
we can already distinguish human and ani-
mal blood this blood test which henceforth
every person would have to carry about
with him indicated on his passport would
at once determine whether any bloodstains
came from his blood or from the victim of
a crime or from some third person this
presupposes of course that there is not
the strange coincidence that a suspect and
a victim belong to the same blood group

  these visits consumed a whole day and
the visit to alesia ended it

  cook took the floor ladies and gen-
tlemen i should like to make you the same
proposal that i did to the gentlemen of the
ocean expedition seven weeks ago i want
you to remain here in santa scientia by
yourselves two nights and a day recover
from all that you have seen each evening
our mechanical reader will operate in the
great hall and inform those who wish to
hear about the origin of santa scientia

  the rooms which were provided the gen-
tlemen and ladies in alesia were exactly like
the others having the same telephone booths
and dictation machines when in the eve-
ning the much admired reading apparatus
began its lecture naturally not one of the
guests were missing

  meanwhile an important conference was
taking place in the main offices in isabella
professors weigand frank vetter van

rhyn ortler zolling and the engineers
romer goldner and grotefendt had asked
mr cook for an interview exhibiting ser-
ious faces likewise bob white was at the
conference a bandage still about his neck

  professor van rhyn began we have
been discussing matters together and i as
the eldest have been chosen to speak we
have very serious doubts whether the course
we have chosen is the right one it is not
to be denied that it is purposeless to live
shut behind a sort of chinese wall the
world must participate in the work of santa
scientia therefore people will constantly
come here in great numbers they will
study in our institutions and fill our work-
shops quiet isabella will become a city
with lively people with women and children
is it not possible that in so small an island
as isabella the real scholars the scientists
who owe their results to seclusion and peace
will not find their required atmosphere in
the future will not the noise of the
world which is now to enter even here
hinder our reaching their real goals

  mr cook smiled if i had not consid-
ered that i should be a poor observer and
a bad executor of the heritage which the
scientist alesius left to me permit me to
postpone answering you until tomorrow at
the great assembly i must still wait for a
telegram but please be confident that i will
always be true to the main aim of santa
scientia

	 

at length christobal and the negro had
waked from their drunken sleep and
were crouching in their cave

  sam had even made a brief attempt to
leave it during the night when the major-
ity of the visitors had left he had sneaked
into the city and had nearly fallen into the
hands of the guards returning he said
we must wait

  how long

  days even weeks perhaps until the air
clears and our enemies conclude that we
have left the island then it only remains
to steal a boat and do just as we did in our
first attempt row over to san salvador
from there we will move on further

  they crouched in the cave before them


wonder stories

lay the stolen property the jewels of the
incas time passed with infinite slowness
for them and both became nervous

  the two companions had long since
dropped all formalities they began to di-
vide their booty again from sheer bore-
dom this led to quarrels each wanted
the main part the eyes of the negro shone
with greed i did it all i led you to the
treasure vault

  i knocked down bob white when you
were too cowardly

  i cowardly

  they reached for their knives the old
hatred between the white and the black was
making its appearance christobal despised
the negro and thought it ridiculous to share
with him and sam was on fire with the lust
for gold

  hours passed during which they made
mad plans 

  i shall go to england and live as a rich
man no i shall open the largest gamb-
ling house in frisco said christobal

  and lose everything again i shall go
to africa and become president of a negro
republic i have gold said sam

  then their alcohol-disturbed brains again
became heated for hours they crouched
opposite each other each taking cover in
the rocks knife in hand with the booty
between them

  again hours would come in which both
felt i unconquerable thirst for air and the
open and moments when christobal longed
to be back in frisco in the bunk-house back
in the gaming dens with his pals sam
would think of his cave at the summit of the
mountain where he had so long lived and
gazed out to sea

  the provisions were running short there
was no more wine and brandy now came
hunger and thirst

  you must go i-nto the city we must eat
and drink said christobal

  why i

  because i do not know the way about

  tomorrow night

  sam had to go he had to enter the
city and leave christobal alone with the
gold he turned around again come
along i am not going alone

  i should give us both away

 you go alone an idea suddenly
flashed across sams mind if christobal
was caught he would be rid of him

  but then the negro jumped up stay
ill go he had reflected that if christo-
bal were captured he would certainly be-
tray him and the hiding place

  the negro sneaked away and the other
one listened and waited hour after hour
sam did  not return christobal felt
pleased now he was alone and all the
jewels belonged to him he spread out the
treasures and revelled in them at the
same time an anxiety came to him suppos-
ing sam betrayed him

a bold plan

he could no longer endure it in the cave
out he crept on all fours like a beast
and crawled behind the rocks he saw the
searchlights the sea with the artificial surf
and the lights of isabella he felt weak
from the days and nights in the cave whose
alcohol-laden air he had breathed christo-
bal lay trembling with a feeling of an
imminent fever he thought he heard voices
about him and started up clutching his dag-
ger the searchlight swept a cliff above
him on this rock sat the devil the devil
incarnate-monstrous with a great head and
serious eyes and a wild jagged topknot
which stretched along the creatures back
a devil a dragon from prehistoric times

  the giant iguana the beach dragon
which still lives attains a great size only
in the iguana islands and which the outcast
had never seen before sat perfectly motion-
less and gazed fixedly with its glittering
eyes in its rigid calm it looked mighty
and terrible christobal whose ideas were
slowly becoming confused thought that this
beast was looking right into him and that
it was reading his soul like a judge in the
lower world he found himself actually
kneeling and stretching out both hands to
the iguana as if in prayer

  he opened his eyes and saw sam in front
of the cave in an instant he was relieved
but he kept quiet and watched him the
negro threw down a bag listened at the
utopia island



mouth of the cave sneaked ahead and came
back now his face was turned toward
christobal his eyes stood out of his head
his teeth were bared like a tigers and his
whole body revealed blood-lust he is
asleep he murmured softly to himself
while foam appeared at his mouth

  christobal understood sam now intend-
ed to murder him in the cave involuntar-
ily he sprang up it was only three paces
t the steep drop into the sea

  the negro threw off his upper garment
and turned his back christobal leaped on
him with all his might encircling his throat
as he had done with bob white and throw-
ing him to the ground

  sam was overcome with surprise only for
a moment christobal had underestimated
the strength of his enemy at first the
negro thought it was the police but then
h looked into christobals eyes

  a fearful struggle began each held his
knife in his hand and each was striving to
hurl his adversary over the cliff

  a shrill whistle sounded both relin-
quished their holds somewhere a light
flashed

  into the cave

  they carried the sack together and seiz-
ing the cast-off clothes vanished into the
cave crouching down in the dark the
steps passed by up above in their com-
mon danger they had forgotten their hate
sam lit up and built a fire for cooking
we are like children he remarked

  they seized the contents of the sack and
ate and drank pouring the wine down until
they were again drunk in stupor and ex-
haustion they sank against the rocks and
finally went to sleep now both had been
made defenseless by the alcohol they had
forgotten everything there they lay each
with an empty bottle in one hand and a
knife in the other in uneasy sleep while
the slowly dying light of their fire shone
on the jewels of the incas which lay be-
tween them   

in the great hall of the central building
of isabella the guests were assembled
the members of the league of nations and
the representatives of thirty-five countries

after all had taken their places mr cook
opened the meeting in the spectators seats
were also the seven ladies of isabella and
all the engineers

  ladies and gentlemen santa scientia
awaits the judgment of the world

  the foreign minister of portugal as the
eldest the dean of the commission of the
league of nations spoke first may i ask
you to tell us first what you plan for the
future

  we intend to become the university and
technical school of the world we want to
give to every genius every man who thinks
he can make a new discovery or invention
for the benefit of mankind a quiet place
to convert his ideas into reality and try
them out but we want to carry on no
theoretical knowledge only the practical
kind we intend to leave it to other uni-
versities to determine the different kinds of
deep sea fish and to undertake bold explora-
tions at the north pole we welcome know-
ledge which benefits mankind which teach-
er it to utilize the forces of nature we want
to free man from menial toil to develop his
mind and to widen his powers therefore
this university is to be joined to a technical
school which at once makes real and eva-
luates what the scientists work out

  if someone has a plan for a ship to
travel interplanetary space he shall build
it here if someone knows new ways to
store up the solar rays and their heat and
to utilize it in cold regions he shall try
it here if a physician discovers new cures
then his clinic is here there are only two
things which may never be mentioned in
santa scientia politics and war there-
fore santa scientia may never belong to
another state so that it may never out of
prejudice prefer one nation to another
prejudice prefer one nation to another

  thus the highest law of santa scientia
must be that its scientists may never set
about making war machines the great
world university of santa scientia is to
serve the universal peace of mankind the
welfare of the dwellers on our earth and
the complete and peaceful utilization of our
planet in a common endeavor


wonder stories

  how will you accomplish all this on this
little island

  the day before yesterday i made a new
agreement today i received the sanction
of the government of puitu by a purchase
the terms of which are my private concern
i today have bought all the iguana islands
this also removes the worry of our learned
men as expressed yesterday that the com-
ing of outsiders might disturb their quiet
now we have six larger and a number of
smaller islands these islands are useful
here in isabella where our city is now
built the entire government will remain in
the future also the factories with the mod-
el shops for all industries will be here as
well as the lecture rooms of the university
this is the only place where outsiders will
live

  perhaps we will erect the institutions for
research in pure science on san salvador
such scholars as need complete solitude will
have at their disposal the islands of march-
esa espanola santa maria santa cruz
pinta and jenovesa along with many very
small islets while fernandina we will keep
for all time as a natural park of course
this apportioning is still subject to altera-
tion certainly all scientists and inventors
will find peace and quiet and here on the
large island of isabella will be established
the communication point so to speak be-
tween us and the world

chapter xxvi
a new nation

  rrhen you never intend to leave the
jl vicinity of these islands the portu-
guese minister asked mr cook

  only if the world wishes us as teachers
but we will work out great plans you
have already heard of our first work how
we used the volcano to generate electric
power for ourselves mankind is wasting
the earth it has the false idea of adapting
itself to nature instead of making nature
serviceable to it we carry on agriculture
in regions which hardly promise success
and we leave the tropics to the primeval for-

est and the wild beasts simply because w
can do nothing there by human power

  we dig into the earth and see with hor-
ror the slow decrease of our coal supplies
but the ever constant power of the sea waves
remains unused though it could operate our
electrical plants millions of people die of
illnesses yet we have infinitely great areas
almost free from bacteria in which they
could be cured

  what have nations done before us just
think that the incas to whose civilization
we owe our treasures knew how to convert
the present desert and unfruitful mountain-
land of peru and ecuador into one bloom-
ing garden let us devise together with
the aid of the studies of the world university
of santa scientia a plan for a magnificent
utilization of the whole earth let us show
the way work out the plans and be lead-
ers

  cook had finished on all sides questions
were asked which the individual scientists
answered in detail stenographers were
superfluous at this meeting for all the
speeches were automatically recorded and
sent by wireless to transmitters which in the
lower rooms of the central building dictated
them through loud speakers into typewriters
at the same time there sat in these rooms a
whole army of translators whose transla-
tions of the proceedings were again given
into loud speakers thus a few minutes af-
ter the conclusion of the session everything
which had been dealt with was translated
into all the languages on earth printed and
sent by radio to all countries

  the league of nations withdrew for dis-
cussion a whispering went on in the room
the representatives of the individual coun-
tries did not wish to express any opinions
until the gentlemen from geneva had spoken
mr cook who was to receive judgment on
his work at this time was perfectly calm

  the gentlemen of the league of nations
returned and again the portuguese foreign
minister spoke

  mr cook i address you as the owner
of the iguana islands to which you have
given the name santa scientia we are
merely envoys and can only make proposals
to the league in geneva let me read to
utopia island



you what these proposals will be

  we and if we are not mistaken the ladies
and gentlemen of the thirty-five attending
countries have recognized that in santa
scientia serious and fruitful work has been
done for the benefit of mankind we have
seen here things which border almost on the
miraculous we are enthusiastic about all
that has been done and about the physical
and intellectual excellence of your work
the speaker was interrupted the room
was filled with -shouts of approval the
bell was rung for silence

we shall recommend that santa scientia
the personal possession of which mr cook
gives up be made a permanent university
and technical school for the whole world
bravo

  we shall recommend that santa scientia
be regarded as an independent country to
be neutral in time of war with its own gov-
ernment and the right to admit only those
whom it deem worthy with the one condi-
tion that santa scientia shall never give
preference to any one country

  bravo bravo

i i oanta scientia must pledge itself

  o	to serve always and at all times the
work of science peace and reconciliation
of all nations the scholars of santa
scientia must always be at the disposal of
the world with counsel and action and give
us the benefit of its skill if it is a question
of bringing their plans to realization in any
place santa scientia must never become
a business enterprise and all its inventions
and discoveries are to become the posses-
sion of the entire world free of charge
bravo

  mr cook are you ready to accept these
proposals

  with all my heart at the same time i
speak for my fellow workers

  then i may tell you something more
yesterday we telegraphed to geneva and the
answer has already arrived we have full
power to guarantee you what we proposed
at the great table in the center of the hall
the representative of portugal as the eldest
signed the document which ensured santa
scientia the scientific state its independence

for all times the representatives of the
thirty-five governments who all had re-
ceived authorization by telegraph crowded
up and proudly signed the strange docu-
ment which had as its first signature simply
the name cook 

  a last joyful meal united the participants
in this important meeting in the evening
hours these guests left isabella and with
them went almost all of those injured in the
sport festival who had hitherto been cared
for in the hospitals

  the first to leave the harbor was the
yacht with the members of the league of
nations then followed the great lloyd
steamer which was to take the other guests
to frisco this time though none of the
guests noticed it care was taken that there
should be no opportunity for escape on the
part of the two criminals who were still in
hiding on the island

  meanwhile there appeared in all the
newspapers of the world the accounts and
pictures of the sport festival in santa isa-
bella at first they were laughed at and
considered good jokes those returning
home were furious because nobody believed
them it was only when the reports of the
government representatives and the conclu-
sions of the league of nations became
known that the stories of the visitors to the
santa scientia olympiad got credence

  the universities treated the whole affair
coolly they rejected weigands experi-
ments in the transplanting of living mem-
bers which were preserved in nutrient
fluids those are nonsensical things al-
ready recognized as impossible during the
war academicians said the preservation
of physical youth by renewing the glandular
secretions was as much ridiculed as the
transplanting of monkey glands in dr vor-
onoffs clinic had been formerly

  then one day there appeared in berlin
two men who both came from santa scien-
tia one claimed that he had a new knee-
jcint the other a new kidney both had
testimonials with them signed and sealed
by dr frank who was still very well known
in berlin and by the representative of the
german government at the isabella olym-
piad these documents stated that frank


wonder stories

had operated on the two men by weigands
process and had provided them with new
organs the men were examined and x-
rayed and it was concluded that the opera-
tions had evidently occurred a cold shud-
der was felt by the gentlemen who hitherto
had doubted everything but then they
shrugged their shoulders again one case
proves nothing frank was always an opti-
mist for years weigand has been out
there among those dreamers who knows
what trick was played on honest frank

  the agreement of the league of nations
and the enthusiasm of the guests had given
the people of santa scientia a feeling of
security which together with their former
successes put them all in a still more joyful
mood

  now there was something else to be done
mr cook and bob white who was again
perfectly recovered were working secretly
with the chemists and prof van rhyn in the
laboratory although a whole week had
passed since the theft no trace of the thieves
had been found the engineers were in-
clined to believe that they had managed to
escape from the island in spite of all the
precautions if new thefts had not occurred
twice in this week both times though at
different places food had disappeared with-
out a trace

chapter xxvii
a man hunt

dr schluter was angry for he had
really been on the watch for the thieves
with his guards for a troop of white volun-
teers had joined the chinese he had watched
every passage two times the bold thief
must have stolen very close to the guards
and had then been swallowed up by the
earth

  finally the chemists finished their work
in the laboratory now masons went to
work with great iron beams the entrance
gate into the cavern with the lake of the
gods was divided up and each of the
divisions was sealed airtight with plates of
glass those of the whites and chinese
who did not know what was going on shook

their heads before the openings of the
cave were entirely sealed electrical appara-
tus was put in thjp place had already been
wired at the time of the sport festival and
now great amounts of the secret chemicals
made in the laboratory were sunk in the
water and set up on the rocks in great con-
tainers then great apparatus similar to
immense boilers were left in the water

  now the cavern was hermetically sealed
from without the entire population of
santa scientia white and chinese was as-
sembled and mr cook made a speech my
friends it is certain that two thieves are
on our island defy our attempts to catch
them one of them is the negro sam the
same one who formerly appeared here from
time to time

  he who has lived on the island much
longer than we is acquainted with subter-
ranean caves of which we know nothing it
is however necessary that there be no secrets
from us it is probable that all these pas-
sages which are certainly connected with
the extinct volcanic system are connected
together now we are going to make a sort
of artificial volcano in the subterranean
lake we have made arrangements for the
production of vast amounts of vapors the
gases will by no means be poisonous but
they are dark colored and are mixed with
material having such a smell that no human
being can remain in the vicinity now we
will spread the population of santa scientia
over the whole island and start a hunt a
smoking out

  your task is to watch wherever vapors
come out of the earth from cracks or little
caves these exits of the great subterranean
cave network are those then that are con-
nected with the grotto and all these places
are to be exactly marked with stakes so that
our geologists and investigators can examine
them

  it is probable that very soon our two
thieves will come out of one of these open-
ings if this happens they are to be caught
and brought to me of course without injury
ti them to calm our chinese colleagues

i	add that a real ghost does not care about
smelly gases if the negro appears thia
will prove that he is a human being
utopia island



the preparations were completed first
a strong light was switched on in the
large grotto of course from the outside
and then the current was sent into the elect-
ric boilers it was an interesting sight that
was witnessed by cook and his friends who
remained before the glass at the entrance
in a short time the water began to boil in
the lake of the gods

  at the same time the chemicals dissolved
and clouds of green and yellow gases filled
the great cavern and darkened the light it
looked like a regular witchs kettle that was
boiling up there and sending up clouds to
the natural dome of the grotto a whole
system of telephone connections had been
run all over the island and elsa dorn and
the other six ladies were operating a tem-
porary central station in front of the en-
trance to the cave while individual reports
of importance were announced by loud
speaker

  two hours passed without any report
the gases had first to find the passages
then it started

  gas east of mt atahualpa

  gas coming out close by the city

  gas west by the shore

  if anyone had now entered the island of
isabella he would have believed that a new
valley of ten thousand smokes had
formed here it was amazing at how many
places the gases came out the whole is-
land was evidently traversed by a network
of passages and the cave investigators were
most eager to examine all

  all day long dense masses of gases were
created until the chemicals were used up
there appeared to be uncommonly interest-
ing geological conclusions to be drawn from
the branching of the volcanic passages
but the main thing had not occurred-no-
where had one of the thieves come out of
any of the cracks

  the power was shut off the water cool-
ed and the gases slowly passed off

  then they have surely fled

or else there are other cave systems
bob white sprang up why not make
another try with the prison this must
also have underground exits even if we
could not find them

  schliiter nodded approvingly of
course for the negro fled through them

  chemicals were again brought and while
it was becoming evening a great fire was
built in the prison cave of course oxygen
had to be supplied artificially to this so
that the door might be closed airtight oth-
erwise the fire would have been stifled too
soon

  again the posts were assigned all over
the island this time for no one knew how
far the passages might run

  cook himself turned on the electric igni-
tion of the fire in the cave this time of
course they could not watch the fire and the
evolution of the gases through the iron
door cook and his friends climbed the lit-
tle hill in front of the city and stood there
chatting

  they did not need to wait long after
a quarter of an hour had passed there was
a loud burst of laughter close before
them almost exactly at the spot where bob
had formerly been attacked this laughter
grew to a regular hurrah out of a split
in the rocks close to the sea which nobody
had observed before staggered two figures
two tattered helpless drunken men with
both hands they convulsively clutched their
noses while behind them escaped from the
cave a yellowish green gas with a frightful
stench

  that very night the two men were brought
before their judges there was still no
regular court in santa scientia in fact
there was no intention to found one mr
cook had simply assembled all the whites
and acted as chairman himself

  the two villains looked pitiful their
bodies were bleeding from the wounds which
they had given each other and their faces
were hollow and sunken from their stay in
the cave silently they stood there denying
nothing merely awaiting their fate

  mr cook asked his friends what is to
be done with them they have stolen but
they have not got any of their booty the
negro has attempted murder but he did not
succeed

  bob white arose let us expel them
from the island they will not again try
to steal in santa scientia

  no one opposed this the next day a

  in the next few days there was great acti-
vity in the little church of santa isabella
the engaged couples were married and
youthful loves who had nearly forgotten one
another were reunited but even the en-
trance of these women was on the condition
that none might come to isabella who was
not physically and mentally sound

  the gentlemen of the ocean expedition
who had now lived long enough in santa
scientia to feel at home determined to re-
main the womans club of the seven lad-
ies was as it were augmented by the addi-
tion of the intelligent older women the
wives and co-workers of the professors

  the islands were apportioned mr cook
remained in isabella bob white was the
inspector and chief minister who went
everywhere and saw that all went well

  elsa dorn remained as manager of the
postoffice and again had much work to do
in the following year the lecture halls and
workshops were to be filled with students
and mechanics desirous of adding to their

the

 knowledge there was the question of tea-
 ing the applicants and of selecting out of
 the hundreds of thousands who wanted to
 come two thousand students and eight thou-
 sand craftsmen

   dr schliiter also had a position he had
 been selected mayor of isabella and police
 chief of all santa scientia

   work was being done on all the islands
and weigand and frank were together con-
structing the great rejuvenation establish-
ment on san salvador

   the hardest job was to choose the worthy
 among the many who wished to try out new
 discoveries and inventions and who desired
 for this the quiet of the little islands and
 the financial help of santa scientia

   shaking his head ortler said to cook
after all our great plan remains a frag-
mentary thing we too must choose and
test we too will consider much to be fool-
ish and childish which perhaps is great and
ingenious we too can only make tests and
we must refuse admission to many perhaps
to the best ones

   cook looked at him seriously yes we
are but human beings still we shall keep
our eyes open and do what we can

   on all the islands great work was being
done day after day there was planning
discovering inventing and testing of every-
thing that was to contribute to the welfare
of humanity and the realization of the ideals
of the world university of santa scientia

science questions
and answers

this department is conducted for the benefit of readers who have pertinent queries on modern scientific
facts as space is limited we cannot undertake to answer more than three questions for each letter
the flood of correspondence received makes it impractical also to print answers as soon as we receive
questions however questions of general interest will receive careful attention

gaining a day

editor science questions and answers

  if an airplane travels westward at the rate of a
thousand miles an hour how long would it take to go
around the earth as the plane travels faster than
the sun it would seem as though the pilot would ar-
rive back before he left would you untangle this
howard sherer

                       flat creek ala

  theoretically mr sherer is correct assuming
that the plane were started in the neighborhood of
new york latitude approximately  north the cir-
cumference of the earth at that latitude is approxi-
mately  miles the plane would make the round
trip in  hours the sun in  hours now if the
plane started from new york at noon with the sun
overhead it would arrive in san francisco before noon
local time and therefore have arrived in frisco ear-
lier than it left new york

  but the presence of the international date line
spoils that little time-stealing scheme the crossing
of this date line which cuts the pacific ocean pretty
nearly in half puts one abruptly into another day
in other words our pilot would arrive at the date line
some  miles away from new york  hours
after his start in five and a half hours the sun has
traveled but  miles and is nearly two hours be-
hind the plane at the date line therefore it is a
little after ten oclock in the morning of the same day
but when the pilot crosses the date line he is plunged
at once into the next day so if he starts his jour-
ney at noon on monday since he gains six and a half
hours on the sun he would arrive in new york with-

out the date line at five-thirty in the morning of
monday but the date line throws him over into
tuesday and so he returns at five thirty tuesday
morning which makes it just right-editor

constructing the hypnobioscope

editor science questions and answers

  i was greatly interested in again reading of the
hvpnobioscope as described in the april issue of
wonder stories i read about it of course in
ralph-c-- and recognized the system as used
in teaching the code to embryo radio operators it
might be of interest to you to know that among radio
operators of the old school it was a well known fact
that one might safely go to sleep while on watch
trusting that any signals that were of interest to
the operator would automatically wake him wliilo
any other calls that might be heard on the calling
wave would not disturb him in the least i can
vouch for the truthfulness of this statement from
several years of personal experience

  i would greatly appreciate the detailed information
necessary to construct one of mr gernshacks hyp-
nobioscopes if such information is available of
course if this information is held as a commercial
secret i cannot expect it to be sent me and will have
to work it out for myself but as i intend to have
one of the machines for my own use and soon any
help i can get would be vastly appreciated by this
i refer to the hook-up used for best results and the
type of instruments

  i believe the use of the telegraphone was first made
public by arthur b reeve in his craig kennedy
stories years ago i can perhaps get the latest details


wonder stories



on this instrument from a friend of mine who is con-
nected with our local branch of the telephone com-
pany

                     donald g reed

                      n western are

                       los angeles calif

  mr hugo gernsback has riven us the following
information

  his hypnobioscope is not sold as a commercial ar-
ticle today although we understand that a number
of manufacturers intend to put out an instrument
of this kind

  the simplest hypnobioscope that can be made by
anyone is as follows

  it is nothing more or less than an electric phono-
graph with an ordinary record of any mubject-music
lecture talk or otherwise-which is rotated continu-
ously by means well-known and the record is auto-
matically played over and over as long as desired
by means of a clock of the typt known as a radio
clock now on the market the phonograph can be set
in operation at any pre-arranged time the clock
can be set so that the phonograph starts operating

what ii gravitation

editor science questions and answer

  if as einsteins latest generalization seems to im-
ply gravitation and electro-magnetism are more or
less similar forms of the universal energy is it to be
assumed that there may be surrounding every material
body or group of bodies a gravitational field some-
what allied to the magnetic field adjoining a magnet
if so may it not be that gravitation extends only a
measurable distance beyond our and other galaxies
and is therefore not actually universal in space

  i do not know that there is any objective evidenco
or proof that mutual inter-relations exist between our
galaxy and other universes myriad millions of
light-years distant in the void

  there seems to be some evidence that our solar sys-
tem is moving as a unit among the stars and per-
haps that our galaxy is turning on an axis of its own
maybe it is a gigantic gyroscope forever whirling
in one plane in one corner of space i
w s varnum

                       la habra calif

                                                

 the illustration herewith shows
how one might learn while sleep-
ing by the gernsback hypnobio-
scope the circuit consists of an
electric phonograph a radio am-
plifier a repeater an electric clock
and a helmet with headphones

let us say at  a m in the morninsr and keeps on
onerntine until  a m or any other time selected
te subject uses a so-called aviators helmet with a
uair of headphones which is attached to a magnetic
pickup or phonograph pickup this headgear is pre-
ferable because it is not likely to get out of place
when the sleeper turns around in his sleep and
changcs his position

  it is necessary for the subject to wear the attach-
ment for several nights without any attempt to oper-
ate it in order to become used to the headgear the
first two nighta as a rule the user does not sleep
very well

  by means of a small amplifier the electrical pickup
system illustrated amplifies the sound to any pre-ar-
ranged strength and the sounds thus reach the
sleeper at any pre-determined volume

  of course any sort of phonograph record may be

used and mr gernsback suggests that a most prac-
tical use for the hypnobioscope today is in the learn-
ing of foreign languages by means of suitable rec-
ords the language can be learned while the subject
is at sleep it is merely a question of repeating the
record over and over again in order to drum the les-
son into the subconscious mind after a few trials
the sleeper will quickly determine how long it is neces-
sary to play any particular record some sleepers
require a repetition of the record for one hour others
more the average perhaps being about three-quarters
of an hour for a -inch record it is not advisable
to use the records for more than one full hour during
any one sleep period as otherwise the nerves of the
sleeper might become affected

  we shall be very glad to hear from those who have
tried the hypnobioscope described-managing editor

  we believe that there is much to substantiate mr
varnums view that universal gravitation as we
perccive it may be only the way that he attraction
between material bodies manifests itself in the neirh-
bivrhood of our earth that is in our solar system
we have very little evidence that the inverse square
law of newton holds throughout the entire universe

  science has not yet been able to explain the basis 
cf gravitation assuming that interstellar space is
empty science has not explained why two bodies can
attract each other across this gulf of emptiness the
ether was invented some years ago as a device which
might explain gravitation that is assuming there
was an ether the force of gravitation could be exer-
cised by disturbing the ether in some unknown way

  the latest and most interesting theory of how gravi-
tation acts is contained in the dynamic universe
scribners reviewed in this issue mr mackaye
the author contends that there is an ether filled with
radiations of so short a wavelength that it pervades
all matter nothing can stop it this radiation liko
light exercises a pressure in all directions when it
passes through a material body however part of the
radiations are changed and some of them lose their
pressure-producing power now if there wero
only one body in the universe nothing resembling
gravitation would occur for the change in radiation
would be the same in every direction but given
two bodies as the earth and moon the space be-
tween them is filled with a great deal of the prea-
sureless radiations inasmuch as both bodies have
pressing on them the pressure producing radiations
there exists a tendency for the bodies to draw to-
gether this tendency mr mackaye calls gravitation
although this theory is open to many arguments it is
an approach to an understandable gravitational pheno-
menon that might act oniversally-editor

better than these

editor wonder stories-

  indulging heavily in listing the stories that they
deem good not so good or had praising or knocking
the contents of wonder stories and pointing out
button-holcs in the authors science social and gen-
eral facts the readers overlook much choice material
that they should have included somewhere in their
letters-even if in a postcript for example the ten-
dency among the authors to forget their own past
stories if we readers cant set them right perhaps
they could go back to last year in one of their hypo-
thetical time-machines re-read their stories of that
date and then return to  with corrected data

  take one edsel newton he wrote a story con-
taining one heroine with one christian name then
he wrote another story injected the same heroine in
it and altered her name i forget the name myself
now so cant say just how it was changed if it had
been helen in the first story itd have been euen in
the sequel this same author by the way misstated
that harold and wilbur wright invented the air-
plane

  and the rescue from jupiter you need not
purchase a time-machine or a memory course to re-
call that nina heroine of that story was black-as
tar-albeit suppositiously beautiful but in the re-
turn from jupiter the same girl has slim white hands
according to the author mayhaps she wo wearing
gloves or the scientists of neina had wonderful bleach-
ing agents quwain edwards could have divulged the
secret for the benefit of his colored readers 

  and seriously  wish to say this there is no
reason whatsoever for keeping the standard of science
liction low in the common dirt all the while bending
every effort toward raising it to popularity the mat-
ter of the wild-west wovers and the pulp-paper is now

uite hoary and i who have read science fiction bince
lugo gernsback inaugurated it as periodical have
given up hope of having a white paper sciencei fiction
magazine that is reserved for future attainment
 may bring such prosperity that pulp paper will
be obsolete

  but contents of said magazine that is entirely dif-
ferent must you need print such tripe for producing
nightmares as the terrible monster great green
things the dome-headed men from pluto and
the like  it is not science fiction why not more-
and more really entertaining and informing stories of
electromagnetism chemistry and medicine biology
the man who evolved for a good model and
mechanics instruction that is not vague reference
to rays electrons or not even that intrigue be-
tween scientists inventors people of other worlds
only a few of your authors handle it with mature skill
and interest most have their characters common ad-
venturers-tom dick and harry-and at times a
sally gawain edwards and von hanstein are the
best writers you havn d h keller can write well
too when he feels likp it

  your stories of the future inevitably reveal that
men of the future are pugnacious enough to battle with
the heroes as suggested by others why not give
preference to those stories that are both futuristic and
afford food for thought stuff like wells upon whose
work most modern science fiction is based social
economic as well as political and personal sexual
developments of the future make interesting reading

  the editors i think are sided with the negatives in
the love yes-no- controversy at any rate when
a heroine trots into a story she is always beauteous
and her sole purpose seemingly is to be an object

old-fashioned brick bat all are equally welcome
allof your letters as much as space will allow wiu
be published here for the benefit of all due to tno
large influx of mail no communications to this de-
partment are answered individually unless oc u
stamps to cover time and postage is remitted

which the hero may embrace utter a few words to or
be pursued by a lustful villain you believe that 
large majority of your readers are young btudents-
men then why the discarding of  science i a
large percentage of your large majority are women
students we may be as interested in science ana in-
vention and social problems as ve are alleged to bo in

pcheapening and masculating dont think that i
want an e prefixed to the last word the magazine
means that we change our minds while the other pat-
rons of newstands look on and take a movie or true
story magazine instead 	

  and despite this i sometimes wonder if any of tne
throe most popular five-cent -weeklies would deign to
print a science-story unless sir arthur onan doyle
wrote it and certainly the young readers of theso
publications rich or poor arc no more advanced in-
tellectually after perusing them than after reading suco
b science story as the terror of aryl

  the former stories of rich bourgeoisie and their lovd
affairs people who indifferently accept the fruits of
scientists and inventors  take a census of the
science knowledge of the white paper readerb more
information about racketeering and movie idols than
of einstein and the vastness of the universe more
about the prices of diamonds and how to get them
easily than of the allomorphism of carbon less facts
about the probable destination of civilization than of
the etiquette of eating drinking dressing petting
science fuction is at least better than these

                      miss k e wright
                      northfield n j

  miss wright throws a challenge into the faco of
science fiction that it cannot well ignore we admit
in all truthfulness that there is much to be said for
her indictment and we have been conscious of it for
some time we admit that science fiction cannot
grow by merely feeding on wild west stories of the fu-
ture  our caution to authors has always been to
inject into the story a background that will point out
a lesson provide food for thought stimulate the mind

  naturally it is not always easy to do this the
art of writing these stories is young in fact the editor
of wonder stories started the first science fic-
tion magazine in the world only as far back as 
before that the only science fiction known consisted
of the wells verne and conan doyle classics a scat-
tering of novels by other writers who took a tempor-
ary fancy to a scientific theme and an occasional
a very occasional magazine story

  we are sincerely trying to see in what way science
fiction can most fulfill its purpose aud we are try-
ing to train authors to an enlightened viewpoint on it
naturally all of this takes time but the progress is
gratifying	

  the work is beginning to bear fruit here and there
young writers are emerging who show true ability-a
generation of truly effective writers are growing up
who will challenge wells and verne for their laurels
it is our aim to seek out these writers and to en-
courage them

  meanwhile as we improve each issue to make it bet-
ter than the last we are conscious as miss wright
states that confronted with the magazines of eating
drinking dressing and petting that we are better
than these

  we invite further comments from miss wright
indicating how science fiction may be improved in-
cidentally we call to miss wrights attention von
hansteins utopia island and tne exploits of elsa
who certainly is a fulfillment of modern womanhood

the american interplanetary society

editor wonder stories

  it may interest your readers to know that the amer-
ican interplanetary society has just completed its first
year of existence and looks forward to a most ener-
getic second year in pursuing its aims

  the society has practically completed the first lap
of hs reeearc on the possibilities and tises of the
rocket and i oends to continue this research for an-
other year before publishing a complete report which
shall be the first extensive survey on the rocket in
english

  we plan also to extend tho size and scope of our
monthly bulletin to make of it a real magazine that
ehall publish all the news both of america and abroad
dealing with developments in astronautics and rocketry
it will also contain the reports of the societys mem-
bers on the rocket as well as interesting general arti-
cles on the various phases of interplanetai-y travel

  plans are also maturing for a campaign of actual
experimentation on the rocket which we shall be ready
to carry out before the end of this year the society
is also completing plans for the formation of an in-
ternational interplanetary commission which shall co-
ordinate the work of tho national societies and plan
to solve the problems of astronautics on a world wide
basis

  while tho growth of the society during the past
year was very promising we hope to extend uuring
this year the scope aud field of our activities and mem-
bership we have members now in thirty-six states
in canada mexico france and russia to your
readers we offer our active and associate memberships
giving to lovers of science fiction a chance to assist
ip the bringing to realization of the dream of all
interplanteary travel i

  the officers elected for the coming year were david
lasser president g edward pendray vice-president
laurence manning treasurer nathan schachner secre-
tary and dr william lemkin librarian information
about the society and the classes of membership can
be obtained by writing to the secretary at the address

becoming a real force for the development of astro-
nautics we extend to the society our cordial best
wishes for the success of its second year the meeting
of the society on the th of january at tho american
museum of natural history in new york by which it
brought before america the splendid german film by

the gegenschein or counter-glow which is a faint
lijjht in the sky directly opposite the sun-as a com-
et s tail always is-has been explained as a possible
tail of the earth it is very faint but is said to be
perhaps ten degrees in diameter i have never been
able to see it the milkyway makes it invisible dur-
ing the middle of the summer and the middle of the
winter it has been suggested also that the counter-

sow is akin to the zodiacal light an illumination in
e plane of the ecliptic extending to perhaps  deg-
rees from the sun and probably caused by a very
tenuous cloud of cosmic dust whose particles mav re-
volve about the sun in orbits similar to that of the
earth mostly within the earths orbit reflecting sun-
light

  if the counter-glow is really a tail like that of a
comet it would seem that the other planets near the
sun should possess them which they have not been
observed to do

  with cordial best wishes for the continued buccesb

  we are very glad to present mr williamsons ex-
planation to our readers wo understand that a dis-
cussion of qegenschein appeared in the march 
issue of tho scientific american-editor

the supreme qualification

editor wonder stories

  just a note of appreciation for the new form of
wonder stories but appreciation especially for
one of the stories published in the march issue the
synthetic monster by francis flagg flaggs stories
are  realistic that the reader cant help but live
them they absorb one to the point of cutting away
all workaday ties with this busy world and believe
me that is the supreme qualification needed by the
writers of science fiction in putting their work
across to the reader

  flaggs stories never fail to do this another point
to his credit is whenever he makes reference to tech-
nical or scientific data he does so with such fine skill
that these technicalities are read as avidly as if they
formed part of the action of his stories too many
stories by other writers are spoiled to me through the
unskillful introduction of tiresome technical details that
provoke skipping and often one discovers that this
skipped technical matter bears directly on the plot
and one has to go back and wade through passages
that might have come out of a college textbook

  however whenever i begin to read a francis flagg
story i know right away that i will not have to skip
any passages because every one of his stories i have
read has been so masterfully constructed that i have
never failed to read every word he has written give
us more of francis flaggs stories in wonder stor-

editor wonder stories-

  the april issue of our wonderful magazmo
has just arrived

  the cover is fair i cant say that it makes my
heart palpitate madly which would show as i am
only human that i was excited or anything of tho
sort its just medium

  but the stories -they make up for my lack of en-
thusiasm over the cover welcome back to our
magazine miss leslie f stone welcome back i its
been a long while since weve had one of miss stones
remarkable stories grace the pages of wonder stor-
ies the conquest of gola is one of her very
best i should like to sec a sequel to her women
with wings

  the emperor of the stars by schachner and
zagat comment unnecessary an adventure in
futurity is par excellence same applies to the sar-
gasso monster and great green things and now
about the man who evolved and the return from
jupiter mr edwards sequel deserves far more
praise than i can give it let some learned gram-
marian pat on the back mr edwards the man
who evolved is engrossing thrilling starkly con-
vincing another masterpiece to your credit mr

  the next issue is an all-star one from all appear-
ances mr starzl repp and von hanstein are bure
to present us with new and astounding stories

  a great war over whether time-traveling could be
or could not now seems to be raging no one knoioa
thats certain i believe it is possible but neverthe-
less would like to present an entirely different i be-
lieve paradox this is quite different from killing

this marvelous cover by paul our prof bryl re-
turns to the year  with his all-star issue of

supposed to be written by anyone else than frof

 mr ackerman has thrown into the editorial sanc-
tum a veritable bomb perhaps now it is possible
that some of the stories we use are reprints of vol-
ume  of the year  what are we to dot
if we refuse to publish them now on the grounds of
stealing the fruits of the future we will deprive our
present readers of the stories and by doing that we
may so restrict our present stories that those who
look upon us now as inspiration for future genera-
tions will not receive it science fiction may be so
blocked therefore that no stories will be published
at all in the year  we call upon our readers
what bhall we do-editor

the penalty of superiority

editor wonder stories	v

  i have just finished the april number of your
magazine i certainly enjoyed it since you changed
the size you have been steadily improving keep up
the good work as the pioneer of science fiction you
must always remain the leader

  three of the stories in this number are as fine as
anything i have read the emperor of the stars
is an adventure in scientific fantasy that ranks in the
forefront of imaginative romance tho basic concep-
tion is daring the existence of another cosmos be-
sides our own where altogether different physical
laws prevail and the adventures of the heroes is
good action stuff the authors of this little epic
nave been setting new marks for fiction of this type
i hope that they will give us more of their works
an adventure in futurity is another splendid
narrative the author succeeds in erecting an en-
tirely credible civilization of the future i like par-
ticularly his novel device of having a man of the future
come back to the present with a time traveling mach-
ine this obviated beautifully the threadbare and
rather incredible method of having a man of our time
 great a genius as to invent a time machine with-
out a background of long experiment of many failures
euch as all modern inventions have required before
their completion

  but i do think the author might have been ingen-
ious enough to figure out some way in which man of
the future could succeed in saving earth for our
race

  tlio man who evolved is not really a story but
a scientific treatise however the thing is very well
done one follows with bated breath the various stag-
es in mans evolution wondering what is to come next
and the final episode wow 

  leslie stones story might have been splendid the
ideas aro all there but somehow it is unsatisfying
perhaps i find it so because it violates two funda-
mental emotions in me pride of race and prido of sex
we humans may be just crawling bugs on an infin-
itesimal rock in an immensity of space but we like
to think of ourselves as the noblest works of nature
we resent any aspersions on this conception of our
own worth

  the other two short stories are a couple more of
thoso things hundreds of yarns just like them have
appeared in the science fiction magazines and i sup-
pose will continue to appear but why should you
inflict them on us please mr editor if you must
resort to space fillers choose at least novel themes

  i had almost forgotten tho last installment of the
return from jupiter just fair i expect much
better from gawain edwards had the serial been
written by somebody else i might have been better
pleased but mr edwards has set so high a stand-

not do worse-editor

dr breuer explains

editor wonder stories

  in regard to mr millers question in the may issue
of wonder stories i shall do my best to state an
opinion but am afraid it will not be very satisfactory

  in physics mathematical equations have no a prion
meaning they are merely abbreviated approximate
statements of fact they are not always even exact
statements of fact facts are stated in mathematical
equations because it can be done more briefly and more
accurately

  but not every mathematical equation states a fact
it is possible to string up all sorts of equations that
have a very close resemblance to such equations as do
express physical facts but which mean nothing or
about whose meaning we know nothing

  therefore in reply to mr millers inquiry as to
wliat is my opinion i must say that i have none
there are no data on which to base one his opinion
is as good as mine and probably better i do not
keep thoroughly posted on tho latest developments in
astronomical observations or in experimental physics
but as far as i know there is no data of an ob-
jective character to throw any light whatever on the

  i wish to close with the reminder that mathematical

  we are glad to get from ir breuer this illumin-
ating point of view on the relationship between mathe-
matical equations and actual fact as he states so
clearly it is not always possible to make a visual pic-
ture of what a mathematical formula means

  with regard to ono of the postulates of the fitz-
gerald contraction equation that the mass of a body
increases with its velocity experimental evidence was
really adduced in the kaufmann-bucherer experi-
ment cathode ravs were shot into a magnetic field
and the deviation from their path caused by the field
was studied at various velocities of the rays now it
was assumed that at higher velocities tho particles
fcvould naturally deviate less than at lower velocities
but it was actually found that the lessened deviation
was more marked than could be accounted for merely
by a greater velocity the only answer could be that
as the velocity increased the inertial mass increased
also as postulated by einstein and therefore tho rays
were less affected by the field the assumption
would be that if the speed of the rays were that of
light they would be unaffected by the field at all-

the dynamic universe by james mac-
 kaye  pages stiff cloth covers size
 g x  published by charles scribners
 sons new york price 

  one of the many unexplainable mysteries of our
physical universe is undoubtedly the nature of gravi-
tation no satisfactory explanation has yet been of-
fered why two material uncharged bodies attract
across the vastness of interplanetary and perhaps
interstellar space

  isaac newton appeared to have accepted that ac-
tion at a distanco was quite within reason but
modern physicists are inclined to doubt that material
bodies could affect each other over a gulf of nothing-
ness to explain gravitation and also the transfer-
ence of radiation through space the ether was in-
vented and for a full generation its existence has
been a source of violent debate among scientists
although micbebson and morley in their classical ex-
periments on the velocity of light seem to have ef-
fectively destroyed its possible existence it has lived
on now in theauthor of the present volume to receive
another champion	

  mr mackaye postulates three things  that the
einstein relativity theory is only a dimensional dis-
guise for doppler effects  all matter is only
forms of radiation  gravitation is but a radia-
tion effect

  the third principle which perhaps is characteristic
of the other two is based on the belief that all space
is pervaded with pressure-producing radiations
this is our so-called ether the radiations are possibly
shorter than anything we know and therefore pass
through all matter as well as all space but when
they pass through matter their nature is changed
somewhat-some of them losing part of their prebsure-
producing power when they are re-radiated now if
there were only one material body in the universe it
would not be affected since radiations enter and leavo
it equally from all sides but given two bodies such
as the earth and moon between them will be formed

book reviews

a low pressure area and thus they will bo forccd
together

  looked at hastily this theory is simplicity itself
and it begs for acceptance mr mackaye determined
however to indicate its universality by examining all
that we know of atomic physics as well as tho rpla
tivity principles in order to prove it conclusively his
book is technical without being mathematical and is
evidently designed for the non-malhematical but scien-
tifically trained reader in brief it is a theoretical
rather than a mathematical treatise the principles
he elaborates in order to find a unified conception of
all energy manifestations should serv vitally to clarify
the battles that have been raging in the world of
physicists as to the nature of things meanwhile tho
book is cordially recommended as a somewhat revolu-
tionary yet tenable conception of our universe

   by common consent de maupassant
   has become first rank among the
   naturalistic school 

    the literary perfection of his work is
    undeniable 

    iiis tales   are  starkingly true
    to life and the actors in them so ac-
    curately - and unblushingly - de-
    scribed that more once indignant pro-
    tests assailed him

   lie remains and mil remain a master
   of style a man of the art of tala

    the value of his worlc lies in his as-
    tonishing faith in reproduction of

the gambler

he gambles that a lucky break will
come to him in the course of time

m

ost men live in the hope that their lucky break will
come tomorrow or next week or next year

they gamble that fate some day some way will make
them rich they risk their whole lives on what may come to
them in the course of time

    this is a worse form of gambling than gambling for
money with a card sharp or a three shell game expert

    gambling on what time and fate have in store for you
is more costly than any other form of gambling known

    you lose more than money you lose your self-
respect you lose the self-respect of those about you

    and as each year passes your chance to amount to any-
thing becomes slimmer and slimmer

     you get discouraged you begin to feel that fate is against
you you complain secretly about your ill luck perhaps you hide
your shortcomings behind a whole flock of easy excuses

     but the hard cold world doesnt care about you

     youve got to look out for yourself

     time alone cannot help you if it could every man over
 wc-ald be rich

     you cannot count on luck or fate or circumstances if you
could everybody would get rich at some time or other

     your life is too precious to waste away waiting for some-
thing to turn up

    theres one sure way-yes only one sure way-to
get what you want out of life

     nothing can help you but your own brain make your brain
just a little bit more effective and you will multiply your
earning power

     there is no limit to what the human brain can accomplish
scientists and psychologists tell us we use only about ten per
cent of our brain power ninety per cent is unused it lies
dormant the longer it is unused the harder it becomes for us
to use it for the mind is like a muscle it grows in power
through exercise and use it weakens and deteriorates with
idleness

     what can you do about it that is the question you are
asking yourself here is a suggestion

scheme of existence as a result

twice as easy

to become a popular

musician this simple

home-study way

does the very thought of harsh-
sounding scales-compulsory prac-
tice and impatient teachers put a dam-
per on your ambition to become a pop-
ular musician

  with such excuses as-it takes too
long-it costs too much-i dont
know the first thing- about music-are
you alibiing yourself right out of good
times and a highly enjoyable attain-
ment

youre the boss

  youd take up music in a minute
wouldnt you-if you thought there was
a way of learning that made every les-
son easy-that allowed you to study
when where and as much or as little
as you please-that encouraged rapid
progress-that did not cost too much

  all right such a method is far from
being imaginary it is so real that in-
side of a few short months you can
learn to play your favorite instrument

without taking lessons from a teacher

without paying expensive fees with-
out any tiresome technique to struggle
through

  thank the u s school of music for
the utter simplicity of this remarkable
system it removed completely the dif-
ficulty boredom and extravagance from
music lessons now to begin your musical
career you dont even have to know do from
re or a sharp from a flat

  your own home is your studio the lessons
come to you by mail they consist of complete
printed instructions diagrams    and all the
music yon need without extra charge

  a sheet of music is not a riddle to you you
never have to guess whats right or wrong-
you knoxv first you are told how a thing is
done then a picture shows you how then you
do it yourself and hear it small wonder its
twice as easy as old-fashioned private teacher
method

play your favorites

  instead of just scales you are playing real
tunes from actual
notes - right from
the very first lesson
on sooner than you
realize you will be
bringing cheer to
the folks at home
with your playing

confidence and pro-
fessional expression
