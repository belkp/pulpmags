fugitives two

    by robert carse

author of the captain the parson and the sea warrior alone etc

thundering down over the great rock lips but were much
calmer where they passed himhere and the sounds given
were a miraculous and intricate music

maybe later youll be able to appreciate it as music
he thought but first you must cross get over to the
dutchmans saw-mill on the other side dont ever forget
that youre an escaped convict a fugitive and in danger
all the time even here

                               he found several slabs from the saw-mill jammed
among the rocks at the bottom of the bank they carried
him across while he lay prone on them paddling with his
hands and feet he was very tired and he slipped noisily
climbing the other bank take it easy valny he told him-
self the dutchmen have a habit of sending escaped
french back to the prisons

his bare feet were lacerated by the month he had spent

peace was the thing the dutchman sought the
frenchmans passionate dream was reedom
they carried their separate faiths into the remote
world of dutch guiana into the bloody turmoil
of a convicts rebellion and each man had to
learn by battle

roger valny left the jungle at the bank of the
beautiful black river this he knew was the sur-
inam and for days now he had been traveling
through dutch guiana he stood shaking with his fever
and stared through the blue night softness at the falls
of the manadam above him they shone as they flung
fugitives two



in the jungle since he had slipped past the guards at
saint laurent every rock and root in the trail gave
him pain but he kept watching the group of buildings
ahead listening for sounds

  the saw-mill itself was right at the edge of the river
beyond it was the workers barracks and then on a
hillock the bungalow of the owner that was where he
wanted to go to the bungalow the owners name accord-
ing to some of the old-timers over at saint laurent was
jan de boek and he was supposed to hire frenchmen once
in a while

  snores the slight harsh groans of heavily sleeping
men came from the barracks nerves tightened all over
valnys body he was sorry the workers were asleep if
they were awake they might help him if he got in a jam
with the dutchman a green-shaded lamp burned in the
front room of the bungalow he moved toward it slowly
now afraid of capture and return to the awful prisons

the planks of the bungalow porch gave beneath his
 weight creaked as he mounted he glanced nervously
into the room poised for flight but the man seated in the
big hong kong chair beside the lamp remained motion-
less

  come in he called to valny with an impatient voice
what do you want

  valny wore the red-striped cotton trousers of the prisons
and his convict serial number was printed on the chest of
his jumper this guy recognizes you for what you are he
thought speak right up to him he closed the screen
door behind him and faced the dutchman

  my name is valny he said roger valny im an
evade from the main prison at saint laurent i want
work for any wages youll pay

  the man seated in the chair was young and big he
wore a starched white tunic in the dutch fashion and
his belly bulged the bottom buttons his glossy red cheeks
came down over the top of the collar beside him on the
table was a glass of gin and bitters he lifted it and drank
from it

  what was your profession he said before you were
convicted and what was your crime

  roger valny was gazing around the room he didnt
like the dutchmans manner the guy talked like a police
magistrate or a spy i was in the automobile business
at rouen until i was mustered up to do my military serv-
ice he said then i was a staff sergeant and driver
attached to army headquarters on the riviera

  before the war the dutchman said

  yes in  a kind of a scrap developed between
me and a young captain on the staff he stole my girl
in mentone one day when he and i were driving down
from sospel to mentone after maneuvers the car went
over a cliff

  i jumped but he stayed n the car and he was killed
the court-martial brought evidence to show id killed
him purposely because of the girl they wrote me a seven-
year ticket to guiana for it

  now youve escaped the dutchman said youve
heard from the old-timers in the prison that jan de boek
is a nice chap and might give a convict a job although
dutch colonial law strictly forbids it you-

  alors roger valny said give me an answer one
way or the other will you i havent eaten right for
years ive been in the bush for a month im jumpy-

he was worried by de boeks placidity the way the man
just sat there and looked at him blankly out of his blue
steady eyes give me a job or turn me over to your
folks for the police

  there are no police here de boek said

  but a door was being opened in the rear of the bungalow
footsteps came light and quick along the porch roger
valny cursed de boek you dirty slob he said then
he turned ran out in the darkness

tte stopped and hid among the lumber piles along
the river bank a whistle like a police whistle was
being blown from the porch of the bungalow he could
hear de boeks voice giving commands de boek was
telling men to go and search for him to bring him back

  valny crouched hard against the fresh-smelling planks
he found stones and grasped one in each hand when they
came for him he thought hed fight they werent going
to send him back to the boite without a fight

  eight or ten men tall djukas who wore the breech-
clouts of their up-river clans found him they were
empty-handed and stayed beyond the range of his
stones dont be afraid frenchman one of them said
in the talki-talki youre wrong to fear the baas wants
you to work here

  like hell valny said almost sobbing but he dropped
the stones and came forward from the lumber pile to the
djukas

  jan de boek was seated again in his hong kong chair
a girl who had his same features and coloring but who was
much slimmer and quite pretty stood beside him

  this is my sister he said to valny it was she you
heard coming out of her room i have no intention of
turning you over to the police not if you are really an
honest and peaceful man in fact i have need here for
skilled workers can you run a steam engine

  yes roger valny said his knees shaking and sweat
in his eyes

  de boek gestured get the man food grelda feed
him give him a drink then youre to go to the barracks
valny tomorrow youll start work as engineer running
the saw-mill engine ill pay you two hundred guilders
a month

  merci bien valny said he felt stupified and sick to
his stomach from the strain but the bread and cheese the
ham and beer grelda de boek brought him were very
good he had not seen a pretty white woman in three
years and to be near her excited him he became voluble
and witty and talked with her a great deal as he ate

  she spoke a nice french she told him that her family
had a parisian governess at home in rotterdam but
youre not from paris she said

  no he said laughing im from the north rouen
everything that paris doesnt want comes down the seine
past us on the way to the sea tell me maamselle whys
a girl like you out here in the back-bush of south amer-
ica

  because of him she said and indicated her brother
de boek dozed his book outspread on his knees he
served with our landswehr forces all during the war of
- what he saw up along the belgian and german
frontiers shocked him a great deal he came out here to
guiana to find peace with him the idea of peace is nearly
an obsession

  it is with a lot of men roger valny said he grimaced
argosy

but finding it is something else again i should know
the prisons seem to have made you cynical grelda

said

  quit right valny said a girl like you though
and beer like that could change me

she smilled at him without self-consciousness youve
finished all the beer she said now youd better get
down to the barracks and find your bunk and some sleep
avec grand plaisir he said he took her hand and
kissed it let me thank you a thousand times

  when he was out in the dark and going down the slope
to the barracks he started to whistle youre all right
valny he thought for a fugitive youre fine

ii

rphe old negros name was moano yasuko he
was the granman and the chief of all the djuka clans
along the upper rivers he came ashore at de boeks saw-
mill after valny had been working there about four months
de boek sent for valny to come to the bungalow

  you should meet moano yasuko de boek said hes
the man who keeps the peace upon the entire river
youre nuts on the subject arent you valny said
ever since the war broke out in europe thats all youve
talked

  its the only thing that matters in the world de boek
said you will realize it as i do when youve lived here a
little longer

  moano yasuko sat spraddle-kneed on the porch of de
boeks bungalow he was skinny wrinkled and very old
a wide sun helmet was perched over his angular face
and upon the chest of his white cotton robe hung a silver
plaque bearing the coat-of-arms of wilhelmina queen of
the netherlands
he held in his right hand a long carefully carved
mahogany stick which was his djuka sign of office when
he met valny he raised the stick slightly from the floor

  you are from one of the nations at war he said can
you tell me why they fight

  roger valny shrugged and looked sidewise at grelda
there are always wars in europe he said too many
people too much money in the hands of the wrong people
im not sure granman but france is safe behind her big
fortifications what we call the maginot line and thats
enough for me

  de boek had moved to the radio and turned the dials
he got london first and then paris and paris came in
clear translate to the granman he told valny youve
learned the talki-talki

  the announcers voice was hurried he read bulletin
after bulletin the ruffled sheets of his paper making a
queer crackling

  thats big news valny said do i have to tell the
old man about it

  moana yasuko must have understood the question for
he said war is exciting until a man is in it i remember
the last one and how weary even the dutch became of
it at the end through the governor i sent a letter bear-
ing my sign to that place named geneva

  i told them at their league of nations to make good
treaties that would be fair to all nations here on the river
frenchman we aid your kind in escape from the prisons
but in war we are too busy and then you die wanting food
and our help tell me now what the man says

  germany has just begun an invasion of the lowlands
valny quickly translated holland and belgiuta are being
attacked the announcer says that the germans are trying
to swing around the maginot line 

tte was silent for hours after that except for moments
when he gave the old negro a brief sentence of ex-
planation he intently watched grelda and jan de boek
their country was being invaded smashed

  grelda was able to keep a degree of calmness but her
brothers placid nature was acutely aroused he cursed
and struck his hands against the porch rail then he slowly
began to weep for the nazi bombers were over rotter-
dam with care and precision they were wrecking the city

  be calm jan grelda murmured theres nothing
you can do rage wont help

  i know he whispered i know but he continued
to think about the flame-flared rubble of the schiedamsche
dijk the women the children the men killed without
chance and yes without reason all his life he had hated
war yet in  they had made a soldier of him

  you must serve your queen they had said but that
hadnt changed the stink of the dead caught in the barb-
wire at the frontier or the horror of the bodies washed up
onto the coasts from the sunken ships no war was always
terrible and only peace had value

  but now there was no peace

  he shut his eyes as if to do so would hold out the sound
of the announcers words moano yasuko came over and
touched his hand i must go the negro said my canoe-
men are waiting to take me on down-river to paramaribo
but if you ever need me dutchman i am ready you
are a good man you really love peace

  jan de boek could not answer the desire to weep had
locked his throat he shook moano yasukos hand then
once more shut his eyes

  the hours passed and it seemed to him that his head
was an anvil for the blows of the announcers words but
he heard grelda and he heard valny they were together
valny was comforting grelda by making love to her

  that was all right that didnt matter valny and
grelda had been falling in love for weeks but rotter-
dam city of churches and quiet houses and grave beauty
churned into a bloody rubble by exploding steel against
which there was ho defense   

  he rose and stumbled into the bungalow flung himself
down on his bed his weeping was muffled by the pillow
and at last exhausted he slept

  im not much good i guess roger valny told grelda
bis arms locked close around her shoulders but with you
to help me ill be a lot better forget the war and holland
just remember that were here together cherie

  grelda was tempted by the strength of his arms the feel
of his lean body against her it would be fine she thought
just to give herself to love she loved this man she was
sure of roger but love couldnt stop thought not now or
later

  what if france falls too roger she said will you
then also ask me to forget

  no roger valny said he stood back from her
tht will be different i dont think that i talk like a
patriotic frenchman but theres no other country in the
world such as france

  you are proud of it still after all it did to you

  his hands clasped tightly and were painful on her
fugitives two



arms im proud of it still its my country no matter
whats happened or will happen to me my people have
fought for hundreds of years to keep it free

  greldas face was white and strained dont tell
that to jan she said jan would hate you if you did
he believes that its men who think like you who create
wars

  hes wrong roger valny said and come here
and kiss me france is safe yet

  i cant grelda said she was at the door going
through it into the living room ive got no strength
left roger now i must try to sleep-and forget rotter-
dam you must work run the mill until jan is better
you understand

  i understand valny said that i love you
                    i

it was near noon and he was repairing the drive-wheel
belt on the engine when jan de boek came down the
slope de boek smelled of gin his hands shook at his
sides paris has fallen he said and france is finished
what is left of the government has just asked for an arm-
istice

  you lie roger valny said furiously the rage fast in
his veins

  i tell you the truth roger it is all over for yotir
country as it is for mine but at least the people will
now have peace they wont suffer absolute destruction
and death

  valny stared at him as if at a man he did not know
then he walked past him and up the slope to the bunga-
low his mind was still reeling from what de boek had
told him but his thoughts were very clear

  he was thinking of the men in the prisons at saint
laurent they were closer to him than anybody in france
he had been their companion in misery and degradation for
three interminable years before hed been able to escape
some of them were cruel vicious men but a lot were
good-the victims of the same system that had entrapped
him

  now he should go back to the prisons he realized
conditions would be terrible there it was impossible for
him to do anything for france herself that must wait
until the corrupt the traitorous had been found and exe-
cuted but fifteen thousand men were in the french
guiana prisons and what they needed was a man to lead
them to freedom

  he looked up to find grelda before him jan has
told you she said

   thats right he said im going back to the prisons
now with france fallen theyll be left to starve or go
mad my jobs to get them out

  why she said

  because im one of them he said because im still
a fugitive

  a shadow came across his sweaty back and he swung
to find jan de boek there you would be wrong to make
any move like that de boek said all the chances
would be against you if you gave yourself up to the prison
authorities dont be foolishly sentimental

  here you have real peace my sister loves you go
back to the prisons and you lose peace love any chance
of a decent future-everything in fact but peace most
importantly of all

  roger valny cursed and scuffed the ground with his
calloused foot youre an odd guy de boek he said

youre a fugitive yourself what you did was to run
away from the world and hide here you go around carry-
ing that neat little belly of yours and talking about some-
thing that doesnt exist what you call peace s just
well-fed complacency

  a guy without shoes a guy without food and in prison
doesnt-and cant-enjoy peace to get it theyve got
to fight for it and me im going to help them now give
me a couple of minutes alone with grelda and ill push
off

  the memory came again to jan de boek of rotter-
dam in ruins and the blond slim girls like grelda who
had died there valny just didnt get his meaning he told
himself valny was unaware of the essentialrottenness of
those men in the prisons peace would be of no value to
them they were far too brutish ever to have any use of it

  roger he said i repeat to you that youre wrong in
wanting to go those men are vicious swine others came
here to work for me long before your time and all of them
proved no good

  valny laughed at him probably he said the way
you fed and paid them they didnt want to be any good
keep quiet i want to talk with grelda

a profound dismay held jan de boek it made him
fierce and defiant his sister was too lovely too fine
he decided to have her life shattered by such a fool as
valny

  he took her by the arm tried to pull her back from the
frenchman you know grelda he said that if this
man goes now its very doubtful that youll see him
again tell him to stay impress upon him that peace is
the most valuable thing in the world

  i cant do it grelda said maybe im wrong but i
love roger enough to want to let him go i know that hed
be unhappy always if he didnt dont talk any more
jan just let me be for a moment or so more with him
hes-hes my man

  muscles drew hard in jan de boeks arms he had a
vision of the convicts straggling away from the fiery ruins
of their former prisons they would be wild with killing
drunk with all the rum of saint laurent but there was
only one place where they could satisfy their hunger of
years and that was dutch guiana

  theyd cross the river at albina after albina had fallen
to them and been ravaged they would come on to
paramaribo for more food for more liquor loot and
women freed they would be a force of terrific des-
truction

  im sorry valny he said i cant let you go and i
shall shoot you if you try youre a man who has the
ability to free those convicts but once they were freed
theyd head straight for dutch territory cant you imag-
ine what might happen to albina and to paramaribo
nothing could be kept inviolate from them so give up
the idea stay here

  roger valny looked quietly at the revolver de boek
had brought out into his hand then he gave grelda a
little shove the-man of peace he said wants to be
sure that his belly is kept full stand back im not a
peaceful man and im for all the people with empty
bellies

  he closed the space between him and jan de boek in
a pair of strides he laughed at jan de boek and he
cursed him you wont shoot he said youre not

the kind watch-im going to slap your face right now

  he slapped jan de boeks face hard almost knocked
the man to his knees a groaning sound came from de
boek the revolver dropped to the ground and de boek
ran his fingers over his face then he hit with both
hands at valny

  some of the djuka workers from the mill ran up the
slope to watch the fight grelda kept them back in a
semi-circle it is something that must be finished she
said in the talki-talki they have chosen to do it by
fighting

  roger valny had learned his style from the old legion-
naires in the prisons he used the quick-lifting savate blow
of either foot on de boek and he timed it with his upper-
cuts but de boek was stubborn dangerous in his
clumsiness

  he repeatedly charged and one of his straight rights
knocked valny dizzy for several seconds then valny
came back at him sending short hooks to the kidneys
and the ribs and de boeks wind began to fail

  twice he fell down and valny let him rise the third
time valny hit him as he came off his knees give up
valny said or grelda wont know you after this

  jan de boek could hardly see him or hear him but
there would be another time he knew there would have
to be another time he sank back on the trampled guinea
grass of the slope and lay still baas all done he heard
the djukas say then he heard nothing but the cicadas
the djukas were gone and valny and grelda

  he lay still for a long while regaining his strength to
stand when he stood he looked toward the river

  grelda was on the bank a slight clear figure in her
pale blue cotton dress she was motionless her shoulders
bent with weeping out on the river where the current
swung fastest roger valny sat in the stern of a corial
a paddle gripped in his hands valny did not look back

hi

come of the men in the main prison laughed and
 some of them cried and some of them were going
crazy paris had fallen they repeated france had been
subject to germany for months still they were prisoners
here in guiana

  every day the guards came to the doors in the morning
and told them to go out and work several times a week
the commandant told them they were to be freed noth-
ing was done they didnt work and now they werent
being fed the last supply ship had come out from france
in early june

  roger valny kept close among the men he had been
suspected at first when he had returned from the sur-
inam and given himself up now though they were
beginning to trust him and gros louis and the other
gang leaders even charles dufrec looked to him to get
them out

  while he had been away he reflected they had changed
here gros louis the hairy heavy marseillais killer
was tougher than ever and dufrec was more quiet and
reserved of all the men in the prison of course drufec
most keenly suffered confinement

  his crime had been a political one rigged against him
by some of the crooked officials at home and it was only
through the present confusion that he had been allowed to
leave lie diable and come ashore to this prison

  it was good to have dufrec with him against gros
louis and the rest of the tough and dangerous men
drufec believed in the cause of general de gaulle and
that was why he wanted to escape but the element rep-
resented -by gros louis dreamed of escape as a path to mad
and total pillage there had been more than a little truth
valny decided in what jan de boek had said about these
men

  there would be trouble here

  but despite that it was impossible to hold them from
escape the despair and the hatred of the men were
gathering their final awful proportions his job and
drufecs was to lead them right once they got out of here

  we must have a plan soon he told gros louis and
it must be good

  that scratches my back that gros louis said give
us a plan then you say you only came back in here to
spring us so prove it he made one of his marvelously
swift gestures and his evil little spoon knife slid into his
hand

  roger valny smiled at him over dufrecs bowed head
he was unafraid of gros louis the marseillais needed
him all right valny said dufrec and i will get
you out

  why dufrec

  dufrec looked up his lithe body tense you know
why he said not counting valny im the only one
here with any real brains

  gros louis said a filthy word youre right h
said but you valny you do the talking i dont know
about this other guy he still thinks france is a good
country

  we begin by having the men in the hospitals kick
to the governor valny said theres no more medicine
for those lads and theres not sufficient supplies for any-
body in all this place the sick protest first they ask
for a ship to be sent from belem or from paramaribo to
bring stuff here

  the governor wouldnt allow it gros louis said
hes smart enough to know wed make a break for any
ship that came in now do better you

  i will valny said im not through of course
the governor wont call for any ship to put in here so
we kick again-in protest of the treatment of the sick
we ask for a hearing before the commandant here at
st laurent

  he wont give that either dufrec said why should
he after all

  hell have to give something like it valny said at
least hell be forced to call us all out in the main square
and make some sort of explanation then we jump

uttow where gros louiss breathing was harsh
through his flattened nose and his fingers turned
the knife over and over the guards have still got their
carbines and pistols and those who havent run away are
the tough ones

  well use real organization roger valny said you
and i and dufrec will figure out the way it wul be worked
we can appoint a special group to handle each guard
you for instance can be in charge of the group to get
fourbeil

  fourbeil   the name was whispered by gros louis
he whipped me all one night when i was in the stocks
in the blockhouse but i want judique he stole my
fugitives two



money from me just before i was all set for an escape
wait let me call the others

  charles dufrec made a little sign to valny as the
marseillais went away to call the other gangster leaders
do you know what youre chancing man he asked
in a low voice

  i know very well valny said but it cant be helped
we have to use these brutes to free the honest and deserv-
ing lot but stick with me will you ill have great need
for you later

  anything to get out of here dufrec said i must
return to france or reach de gaulles forces in africa
when i think of the germans holding our lovely country
i almost lose my mind  

   they were terrible those other convict leaders they had
the sure soft walk of animals one of the old-timers
chical was tattooed in obscene designs from brow to
chin his huge hands closed as he listened to valny
ill smash the guy he mumbled who doesnt let me
have fourbeil my gang will take him

  then fourbeil is yours valny said here ill
make a list the rest of you can pick your own
guards

  he sat wordless and rigid while it was done they
haggled over some of the list once there was a fight
and a man dropped to the floor with a knife-slashed
shoulder gros louis mocked them

  youre fools he said save that for the guards and
the dutchmen across the river thats where were going
isnt it valny-over into dutch guiana

  yes valny said and the nerves jerked at the corners
of his eyes i guess so

  you better make sure chical said were dying
of hunger here but the dutchmen across the river have
got bread and cheese and beer and meat et puis et
puis theyve got fine blond women

  valny sat as if he hadnt heard that last sentence but
the thought it contained the horror implicit in it were
heavy and hard in his brain he was afraid of these men
and so was dufrec the convicts had been wild enough
before the fall of france but the months of starvation
and brutal neglect since had made them completely un-
reasoning

  all they knew was that there was food to be had in
dutch guiana it was the nearest place and unless they
ate soon they would die so it was to be dutch guiana
the pretty little town across the river then paramaribo
after paramaribo  

  he thought of grelda of jan de boek his weary
brain formed a vision of grelda blond and slender try-
ing to be unafraid but ringed about by grinning men in
red-striped trousers jan de boek had told him he was
mistaken to return here jan had said- he deliberately
took his mind from contemplation of what jan had said

  valny too as these other men here was numb quiver-
ing with hunger it was over a week since they had been
rationed more than a pannikin apiece of rotten rice an-
other week like the last one and hed be finished for sure
no mans crime merited such a death he stood and
stared into the glistening eyes of the men around him

  send men to speak to them in the hospital he said
have them ask for a decision from the commandant by
tomorrow morning if nothing is done by tomorrow night
we demonstrate the next day the commandant will be
forced to have us out for roll-call and one of his talks

that will be our time and we shall know what to do
agreed gros louis said he was looking at the
oihers youve heard valny get started

  wait a second charles dufrec said lets not have
any violence this time no crimes of passion our pur-
pose is to get out of here away from the prisons for
good

  hes right gros louis said to the gangsters slit-
ting a belly that is easy but we want to fill our own
first en route

the prison commandant was a former soldier and
a brave man he stood beneath his umbrella in the
gray soft-plashing rain and gravely talked to them they
stood rank on rank in silence the rain made a faint
rattling on the broad brims of their straw hats dropped
in a steady patter to the puddled ground their bare feet
stirred a tubercular man coughed and from the sheet-
tin roof of the prison came the wet slapping of a vultures
wings

  roger valny looked around him he had reached a
hypersensitive state of strain every detail was very
vivid to him he would never forget the waxed mus-
tache of the commandant and the way it twitched as the
man talked and the buttons of fourbeils tunic two
buttons were off of it right at the chest and that was
the spot where chical had promised to put his knife

  fourbeil didnt know it but fourbeil wasnt going to
live another ten minutes none of these white-uniformed
men would live but that was all right year after year
they had deliberatelylet die thousands of convicts

  the commandant was almost finished he reached
nervously into his pocket and took out a cigarette and lit
it the smell of the tobacco was fresh in the moist air
now the commandant made a motion with the hand
holding the cigarette

  you men will have smokes when the ship comes in
he said you will have double rations and the sick
will get everything they need but the ship must come
from martinique and that is a distance from here i
take my orders from france from vichy and there is
nothing else i can do nothing but-

  nothing but run you swine

  the man who yelled that was the moroccan who had
been chosen to kill the commandant he had his knife
out and he flipped it as he yelled it was a native mor-
occan knife heavy in the haft and long in the blade he
had kept it buried in the dirt floor of the prisons

  a whining sound came from the blade turning in the
air the commandant heard it and his hand lifted to-
ward his throat the knife grazed his fingers passed fully
through his throat he fell to his knees and his helmet
rolled off into a puddle blood entered the puddle he
twitched and coughed and then was dead

  roger valny still watched the commandant for him
the man was a symbol now he knew that the convicts
were going to be free he had nerved himself for this
moment and it was finished on all sides of him the
convicts were killing valny walked away to the edge
of the place des palmistes beyond the prison buildings
and waited for them to finish he no longer felt any
emotion what happened back there was a form of exe-
cution no more brutal than the guillotine that had been
operated by french law

  it was charles dufrec who came to him and told him


argosy

the killing was finished we must go dufrec said we
here in saint laurent are free but there are troops in
cayenne and the governor will send them after us lets
go the place for us is across the river

  yes youre right valny said he moved back and
found gros louis on our way louis he said in a
voice of command get them out before the troops
arrive theres boats enough for all of us down by the
dock and the lumber yard

  gros louis was wild with the killing and he panted as
he talked but he nodded in answer youre a cold-
headed slob who makes sense ill get them out well
save our fun for albina

behind valny and dufrec and gros louis as they
walked to the river the convicts came dancing sing-
ing flames roared in the prisons the convicts wore hel-
mets tunics and pistol belts taken from the guards and
chical had the commandants umbrella

  but they were still stunned with the ease of their victory
in the rear of the crowd were mumbling vague men
who had been prisoners here for thirty and forty years

  roger valny squatted down on the planks of the dock at
the river his head was painfully throbbing and he put
his hands to it youve unloosed forces far greater than
you reckoned he told himself it must have been this
way in paris after the bastille theyre a lotof fine men
here but their sole dominating emotion as a group is
hate

  look across the river dufrec said beside him

  a neat white launch was putting out from the dutch
shore a big dutch ensign hung on the stern staff
officers aijd soldiers sat in close rows along the gun-
wales halfway across it slowed and lay with its head
against the current an officer standing in the stern
shouted through a megaphone

  this is to give you warning frenchmen no convict
can cross the river if he does he will be shot on sight
stay where you are

  stay and starve chical screamed he fired stand-
ing wide-legged the carbine butt hidden by the broad
curve of his shoulders

  the dutch officer fell splashing into the river and the
launch turned fast and went back a machine gun started
aboard it men on the dock were caught in scores the
rest sprawled and cursed then hunched toward the
boats well get them they said well get the dutch-
men just like we got the guards   

  once crossing the river dufrec whispered to valny it
will be very bad in albina theyll be terrible there

  i know valny said he could feel the cold beads
of sweat from his fear running down his throat will
you try to help me stop them make them act like decent
men

  ill do my best dufrec said but we no longer
lead them theyre led by hate

iv

it was jan de boeks belief that he possessed full con-
trol of himself and his emotions he must keep it
he told himself so that grelda wouldnt recognize how
great his fear was

  of course he was forced to take her with him on this
trip down-river to paramaribo but she had seemed to

accept in good faith his explanation that he was going to
see the governor-general about affairs concerning the
operation of the saw-mill he should remember to speak
of the saw-mill when he first talked with the man

  the governor-general wore his medals and a fixed smile
his wife took grelda over into a corner and served her tea
then he said good to see you de boek we need men
like you i suppose that youre ready to fight

  whats happened excellency jan de boek said

  that horde of rats from the french prisons about
fifteen thousand of them have crossed the maroni they
occupied albina and are pillaging the place we ex-
pect that at any time theyll start here for us at para-
maribo

  jan de boek had unconsciously taken the position of a
soldier his heels together his hands flat at his sides i
should like to see the peace kept he said

  impossible the governor-general said without
fighting i recall that you were an officer in the nether-
lands forces in the last war now consider yourself as
holding the rank of captain in the local landswehr ill
have my secretary make out your commission directly and
you can get a uniform to fit you down at the chinamans
then you will join one of the units going to albina

  jan de boek had caught sight of himself in one of the
wall mirrors he recognized the soldierly posture he held
and he was tempted to laugh or to weep

  wheres your dream of peace now de boek he thought
its gone and probably forever you should have known
that when rotterdam was bombed a man can only keep
peace by fighting for it you were just what valny called
you-a fugitive from life up there on the surinam fight
or youll lose everything even your life

  very good excellency he said i accept and thank
you

  then he went over to grelda took her away from the
governor-generals wife im joining the troops whore
to defend the road between here and albina he said
the french convicts have broken loose from the prisons
have crossed the maroni river your-that man valny
must be with them

  youre sure grelda said

  that was the sole purpose he had when he left us
but i hope i have the pleasure of shooting him ill show
him the worth of anarchy and pillage

  greldas eyes widened youve changed a great deal
and very fast jan she said youre fighting for what
you believe and i can understand why but so is roger
all men have a right to peace and to happiness

  wait he told her until you hear what valnys lot
have done to the people of albina now goodbye good
luck after im gone you had better get yourself a pistol
its quite possible the convicts may come here

  no jan she said her throat muscles trembling

  yes he said and strode swiftly out of the room

  down at the barracks the colonel in command told
him there were four hundred men available to defend the
colony so be careful de boek the colonel said this
outfit im giving you should fight a rear-guard action
covering the troops now in retreat from albina our last
stand will be here on this river across from the town
on the east bank of the surinam if we cant hold then the
whole colony goes be careful with yourself and your
troops

  just as you say jan de boek said he was tightening
fugitives two



his pistol belt about his new tunic trying the balance of
the pistol when do i start

  right away the colonel said the road is still open
within three kilometers of albina

te boek marched his company fast on the narrow
-jungle road it was strange to be in uniform again
and to have a pistol heavy against his thigh the peace
he had worked so hard to get hadnt lasted and perhaps
it would never return but the years he had held of it
had been good and now if he felt hatred of valny and
bis lot it was only because they meant further violence
bloodshed and destruction

  flames were against the sky over albina his ser-
geant came back and reported to him that the dutch
holding troops were right ahead in the cane fields on
either side	

  theyve had a tough time the sergeant added the
french rascals have made three attacks since noon and
if it wasnt for the machine guns our bunch would ha
been knocked out

  all right jan de boek said deploy the column as
squads to join the troops in the fields report to me at
the commanders post ill be up there with him

  the commander was a young captain of marines re-
cently transferred from curacao he was very glad
to see jan de boek theyve smashed hell out of the
town he said all sorts of terrible things are going on
but they can fight believe me take a look at the dead
single corpses knots and heaps of men in red-striped
cotton pants lay out upon the road and in the trampled
cane they were the french from the prisons but near
them were dutch dead in glossy straw helmets and gray
uniforms the whole scene xwas lit by the fires from
the town and de boek could distinguish individual faces
and bodies

  roger valny wasnt there he discovered then valny
was in the town screams of men and women drunken
yells and shots came from the town the church steeple
fell in a crashing billow of sparks a woman ran out onto
the road and she was shot she stumbled over dead

  his fingers were sweaty as de boek secured his pistol
lanyard about his wrist he had just decided that he
was going to get up and go into albina and find valny
he was off his knees nearly erect when the marine cap-
tain tapped his shoulder

  dont move the marine said here comes one
of them drunk or crazy but whatever he is hes walk-
ing upright and straight in the middle of the road

  a machine-gunner at the edge of the cane grunted and
set his sights ill dump him quick he said just as
quick as they shot that woman

  no you wont jan de boek said youll save your
ammunition i know that man and hes the leader of
the convicts leave him for me

  he walked with care between the piles of the dead his
pistol hung loose from the lanyard and banged against
his side he was not aware of it he was watching roger
valny the frenchmen was unarmed his hands were
empty

  jan de boek lifted the pistol and aimed it the flicker-
ing carmine diffusion of the flames was behind valny but
some of it illuminated his face the frenchman showed
no fear he was aware of this pistol and that it was
trained on his heart yet he kept coming on

  halt or ill shoot valny jan de boek called
what do you want

  i want to talk about peace with you valny said
in a slow odd voice but if you think it would help
you go ahead and shoot

  jan de boek lowered the pistol he stood immobile
as valny stumbled toward him through the heaps of
the dead

this was victory the convicts shouted they
were free from the prisons and now they had taken
albina food was theirs-food rum and women they
ran past roger valny and dufrec with torches setting
fire to the huts in the outskirts of the town and then
started for the main square

  there was no stopping them

  valny felt a sense of horror that almost overpowered
him he called to the men he knew by name asked them
to halt and listen to him but they laughed at him their
faces ruddy and wild in the firelight some of them
roasted chickens and pigs right in the flames of the blaz-
ing houses others rolled kegs of rum down the street
crashed the necks from bottles and drank from the jagged
ends

  weve created anarchy dufrec muttered not free-
dom

  i hoped that when they were free they would become
decent and peaceful valny said but theyre acting
as brutes without reason its a kind of madness thats
got them i-i want to run away and leave them i feel
responsible for what theyre doing

  you shouldnt dufrec said you cant take the
blame for a prison system thats a hundred years old and
they wouldve escaped sooner or later whether you and i
helped them or not but we should try to stop this if
we can

  gros louis led the sacking of the houses in the middle
of the town the convicts appeared carrying pieces of
furniture wearing mens hats and womens dresses gros
louis grabbed a pretty mulatto girl in his arms collect
all the women he howled bring them in front of
the church and then well divide them

  dufrecs narrow face convulsed i used to be proud
to be a frenchman he said my dream in prison was
to go back and fight for a free france might as well
start here though and now

  dufrec went at a kind of loping run to gros louis
he pulled the girl away from the gangster cut it out
louis he said give the folks a chance they havent
done anything to us

  gros louis grinned so were still to be told what we
can do hein chical take care of this one his con-
science hurts him

  the old tattooed convict was right behind dufrec he
took a sliding stride and his little knife licked up caught
between the shoulder blades dufrec went down silently
his arms flung wide to protect the girl

  chical roger valny said in a cold swift voice
chical turn around and face me

  chical turned with the bloody knife and when he was
fully around valny shot him with the guards pistol he
carried i will shoot all of you who murder he called
to them in the square youre next if you try anything
louis the dutch troops are outside the town on the
paramaribo road unless we chase them back theyll


argosy

be in here and capture the wholefot of us make sense
lets fight them and not ourselves

  gros louis stood with his weight balanced forward his
little eyes were very bright there were two pistols in
his trousers waistband but he didnt touch them chical
was my pal from the early days he muttered but
well square for him later youre right when you talk
about the dutch troopers come on you swabsl leave
the girls and the rum for now weve got to chase them
dutchmen away

  the convicts were foolhardy in their fury they attacked
the small dutch force with yowled cries of warning sprint-
ing openly down the road the dutch had been in retreat
but they stopped and set up their few light machine guns
stubbornly held their positions

  roger valny took part in the attacks perhaps he
thought dully he could find death there in the dutch
bullets how could he face grelda now how could he
face any decent person

  but he fell with fatigue in the road his legs gave under
him and at last he crawled to the ditch at the side
sprawled down headmost

  the shooting ceased the wounded out in the cane
fields were still back in the town there were screams
shouts shots night came and the dark was heavy with
smoky flame valny fingered the pistol thinking of
shooting himself

  but youre stupid he told himself aloud why do
that youd still be a fugitive still he running away from
life if you washed out like that youve got reason to live
the job for you is go and get the dutchmen to bring peace
and order in the town

  the idea was so strange to him that he laughed at it
but it persisted in his mind it was a good idea he knew
it was right there were good men among the convicts
men like dufrec and like himself they wouldnt be really
free though until gros louiss sort the anarchistic sav-
age killers had been disciplined or exterminated free-
dom by itself wasnt any good it was how you used it

  he got up finally and walked along the road towards the
dutch positions he left the pistol in the ditch so that
when the dutchmen saw him they would know he was
unarmed

v

tte heard jan de boek as if in a dream but it was de
a a boek all right here a couple of hundred feet in front
of him he spoke in answer to the mans challenge without
fear or hesitation if anybody should understand he
thought this was the man

  what do you mean peace de boek said

  i mean that the men back there in the town who are
deserving should be saved a lot of them are good they
have a right to live freely and decently just as you did
up on the surinam

  jan de boek stared at him something terrific must
happened to you he said when you returned to the
prisons you dont talk like the same man up on the
surinam you insisted that all men should be free

  they should be but they should understand the worth
of freedom a lot of the men who were in the prisons have
lost the ability to do that

  how would you make them understand

i dont know thats why ive come here to talk to

you about peace but what are you doing in uniform
a good question jan de boek said you forced me to
fight up on the surinam so i was willing to fight again
here i lost some of my sense of values i guess i got so
i hated you and failed to realize any man should have
freedom if he really respects it

  bullets hammered and hummed down the road they
were from the town and the men who fired them were
crawling out into the cane jan de boek crouched and
hauled valny with him theyre determined to go on
he said now theyre headed for paramaribo and we
here are too weak to stop them

  theres no way to stop them valny said

  yes de boek slowly said theres a way but youre
the only man who can do it you remember moano yasu-
ko the old granman of the djuka clans you met him at
my place if you can reach him and if he agrees to do what
i ask him in my message well be saved here-at least the
women and children in paramaribo will

  you must be thinking of asking him to bring his war-
riors down-river as help

  i am

  but why send me to him

  simply because theres nobody else to go ill have
to stay here with the troops the djukas along the river
wont permit any other dutchman but me to get to moa-
nos village on the pikien rio

  you can though especially when youre carrying a
sign message from me ill send you back to paramaribo
under guard grelda is there shell find the right canoe-
men for you arrange it so that the governor-general lets
you go

  roger valny smiled and held out his hand tell me
how far it is he said to the pikien rio and moanos vil-
lage

  at least ten days up-river fast time and four back
with expert canoe-work all the way will you go for me for
us

  ive already given you my hand roger valny said
call the guard so that i can get started

rphe canoe-boys big breech-clouted djukas waited on
the river bank beyond the governor-generals house in
paramaribo grelda introduced them by name to valny
theyre good boys she said theyll take you to the
pikien rio

  roger valny stepped close and took her in his arms ill
be back he said ill bring the warriors but take ce
of yourself will you

  of course she said and kissed him but im not
worried jans lot can keep the albina road closed for an-
other ten days at least the governor-general says so him-
self and by then you and the warriors will be here 
sure valny said then kissed her again and stepped
down into the canoe the black men were ready their pad-
dles sent the water whirling

  roger valny dreamed a lot during those days on the
river it kept him from thinking of what happened along
the albina road and what might happen in paramaribo if
he failed here he projected himself forward into the fu-
ture thinking of the days of the peace when he would
be with grelda and there would be no terrific aching worry
always in the back of his brain

  the canoe-men paddled throughout all the daylight
hours and most of the night this was their river and
fugitives two

is

they were certain of their knowledge of it but several
times in the night the narrow-hulled corial was overturned
in the rapids men and paddles hurled far downstream
valny helped save one of the paddlers dragged the man
off a rock and swam with him to the shore

  bail out he told the others get fresh torches we
keep on going

  baas is a hard man the negroes said

  i have to be he said i have to get back down-
river

  there were carved panels and a beautiful delicately
worked lintel on the door of the house where moano yasu-
ko brought together the clan elders in the village on the
pikien rio

  the talk they held was called krutu and it meant many
hours of solemn discussion and deliberate talk roger
valny thought repeatedly that hed be unable to restrain
himself through it but at last the oldest slowest warrior
had spoken and had received moano yasukos reply
moano yasuko turned

  we have decided to give help to the people down-river
frenchman the word is going out right away and several
thousand of our warriors will be called they will return
to paramaribo with you peace should be kept the krutu
has said and in the past for many years we have held
peace with the dutch so now we feel ready to help pro-
tect them

  i thank you for myself roger valny said seriously
and for baas de goek and all the dutch folk you wont
regret your decision but youre going down-river with
us granman

  no moano yasuka said im too old for fighting
this is the place for me only when there is peace again
will i come down-river get ready now my warriors from
this village are ready and the rest will join you on the
stream give my best to baas de boek he is a good
man

  water whirled white sullen and swift over the canoes
in the rapids going back rocks showed jagged black and
great sunken logs were jammed between the rocks the
canoe-men labored until they panted their arm muscles
cramped and the thick necks bent with fatigue

  but the canoes kept on one after the other through the
rapids down the long smooth reaches of the open water
under the close-branched tree vaults and then around the
great falls the last of those was the manadam and
there they portaged the older men carrying the weapons
the spears the shotguns and machetes

  its the fourteenth day valny told them as they
passed him on the trail the fourteenth day since i left
the town maybe the dutch are already whipped maybe
well enter a captive town hurry hear me

  we hear you they said yet we can go no faster 

  his anxiety became so acute that he could think of
nothing else he counted the hours then the minutes his
strained imagination saw the convicts yowling around the
smoking ruins of the governor-generals palace slouched
drunk before the statue of queen wilhelmina on the neat
grass of the square while gros louis told them how they
would divide the women

  the women   grelda was one of the women grelda
trusted him to save her and the rest

  the keen eyes of the negroes discovered that the town
was still safe his bow paddler told valny that upatant
valny said where then are the men who fight

   across the river on the east bank the paddler said
there the dutch hold and the men from the prisons
are in front of them in the bush hear the quick little
guns

   the machine guns hacked in hard bursts rifle fire gave
a lower sound and it was much more frequent than the
machine-gun bursts theyve used up almost all their
ammunition for those guns valny thought it must have
been quite a rear-guard action from albina

  he scrambled up the bank from the canoe ducked flat
into the palmetto scrub as a bullet whickered over his
head dutch landswehr in varnished caps were around him
they looked spent frightened and their sergeant did no
more than wave his hand

   over there he told valny

vi

jan de boek had the appearance of an old man his
bloodshot eyes constantly blinked and it was impos-
sible for him to keep his hands still youve done very
well he said to valny were all very grateful to you
it was hell getting back from albina they fought us
every foot-charged right into our machine guns

   but weve got a trap ready for them now this terrain
before us is mined i had dynamite brought over from
parmaribo the next time they attack they go right into
it then we and the djukas will finish them every one
valny shook his head for a man of peace he said
you certainly believe a lot in killing itd be a mistake
to use those mines then a lot of good men would lose their
lives for no real reason i think i can go out there make
a deal with them the honest decent bunch will listen to
me theyll surrender if i can offer them square terms
you werent in the retreat from albina jan de boek
said our lads were picked off right and left our wound-
ed were tortured when they were captured dont try to
go out there youll be shot if you do

   roger valny was up on his feet if i dont come back
he said tell grelda i did what i thought was right tell
her a man has to have a chance to live right or wrong
de boek called at him and cursed him but after a time
he was still valny had become a man unknown to him it
made him feel ashamed and stupid without purpose
valny really believed in peace and justice he recognized
and his own set of values was no longer clear

gros louis was the man who met valny i told them
not to plug you gros louis said you can tell us
how to take the town the way you came over here you
know the way through those land mines but where you
been making love to your dutch sweetheart

   no valny said ive been up-river collecting more
than two thousand djuka warriors who can kick the heads
off you the first time they try but theres no sense in
that im here to make a deal with you guys quit the
fighting and the dijtch will treat you well if youre willing
to put down your arms ill go back and tell the governor
make a deal for you

  you talk slick gros louis said your idea is to
keep us out of the town but ill take your girl for my-
self ill show her how a marseillais makes love

   roger valny took his glance from gros louis and looked
at the other convicts hunkered in the shallow rifle pits
not all of you he said are as stupid as louis some


argosy

of you know that to live right a man has to obey law and
justice but you went crazy at albina you all acted like
louis

   heres your last chance to go straight give me your
promise to go straight and i think i can make a deal with
the dutch for you if you dont theres a bunch of dju-
kas waiting all set to bust you wide

   the convicts stared at the tall djukas where they showed
chest-high in the guinea grass their weapons lifted in
their hands call over the head guys from the djukas
they said those are the bunch to worry us not the
dutch

  about twenty of the blacks came forward when valny
called the chief-men of their clans and villages they
moved with caution their faces resolute and thoughtful
the oldest of them asked valny we fight

  no valny said not unless were forced some of
these men are good they want to stop fighting and then
want peace could they get it up on the pikien rio
possible the djuka said moano yasuko could find
land for them if they acted like honest men

   roger valny told them to the convicts these are the
chief-men he said they say theyre sure the granman
would find a place for you safe on the upper river if you
dealt on the square

  you talk gros louis said like a guy whos sold
out how much are the dutchmen paying you come
on you slobs lets bowl these blacks down then ram
through to the town

  not yet you dont roger valny said what you
want isnt what therest want

  gros louis struck at him without further speech he
knocked him to his knees and kicked him in the face

   valny got painfully erect he had forgotten how tired
he was what those days on the river had taken out of him
but he had to fight now if he didnt fight gros louis
would kill him

  

tje and gros louis staggered back and forth across
the space left open for them by the convicts and the
djukas this had at once become clearly a fight for su-
premacy and it would settle the whole issue

  gros louis talked about it as he fought when im
through with you he said ill take your head and hang
it on the fence at the governor-generals joint then ill
have your girl serve me dinner off the governors best
silver so fight lets see your stuff

  roger valny fought with all he had he cut at gros
louis with short crafty blows striking for the low-slung
jaw and the broken nose but the marseillais was very
powerful and quite fast blood streaked valnys face and
got into his eyes it was just by luck that he caught gros
louis off balance and then his blow was glancing

  gros louis rose up rapidly from it his knife was out
and he raked the evil short blade in at valnys groin
valny took the stroke turning away and on his left thigh
but the pain was so intense that he dropped prone weak
and helpless

  get up gros louis said ill finish you on your
feet

  no jan de boek said he wont get up de boek
had forced in past the djukas to face gros louis im his
friend and i believe in the same thing he does work on
me and let him be

  un type de drole gros louis said a dutchman with
guts well ill carve them out of you

  he went after de boek with the knife laughing talking
all the time de boek retreated before him his hand away
from his holstered pistol but then as gros louis got
close to him he made a sudden gesture toward it gros
louis stepped in swinging the knife jan de boek kicked
him on the knee cap and he wore thick dutch garrison
boots

  gros louis lay on the ground and writhed ill carve
you he mumbled you cheese-head ill carve you
apart

  drop the knife de boek told him if you dont i
will be forced to shoot you

  gros louis still held the knife he raised up part way
to throw it at de boek then de boek took out the pistol
and shot him through the head

  a couple of the convicts and one of the djuka chief-
men helped de boek as he ripped away roger valnys
trouser leg and put a tourniquet on his thigh wait until
you get to paramaribo and have a drink of brandy and see
grelda de boek said then this wont matter

  it doesnt matter now valny said but i wont be
happy until all the boys are up-river and finally at peace
they went in hundreds of canoes up the surinam
frenchmen and djukas in each canoe there wasnt much
for them to eat and the frenchmen kept very quiet not
fully sure yet that this was freedom and the road to peace
but when they camped the night after they made the por-
tage around the manadam falls roger valny asked to be
carried out beside the main cooking fire he motioned
with his hand and brought all of the frenchmen around
him

  i want you to sing he said i miss her the girl i
left waiting down below for me

  you know a song she would like they asked him

  go talk to the dutchman to de boek valny said
hes her brother

  de boek came to sit at valnys side as the frenchmen
grouped to sing a man who had served in the foreign
legion led the singing it was a german song he sang be-
cause he knew no dutch it was heilige nacht

the end ol the dugout was caught by

careened and rolled over

it took mountain men afraid of nothing to open
up that vastly rich territory fed by the brown and
turbulent missouri here is the saga of two such
men and a steamboat and their pioneering thrust
against those murderous waters

roll missouri

chapter i

river of malice

like a sullen snarling tiger the swollen missouri
clawed at its banks hurled its tawny flood down-
ward its surface was cluttered with rolling cot-
tonwood logs bobbing stumps even whole walnut trees
bodily uprooted by the roaring april freshets

  any one of those sodden snags would have ripped the
bottom out of the light canoe like paper yet it twisted
and darted among them unharmed as by a miracle the
miracle lay only in the deft paddles of the broad-shoul-

dered thin-waisted young man in the stern and the
lankier grizzled man in the bow

this canoe was dug out of a solid log its sides smooth-
whittled to less than an eight of an inch of thickness
equally gaunt were the paddlers even their buckskins
worn almost to shreds-mute testimony of the terrific miles
that lay behind

yet still garry kent glancing anxiously ahead as he
dipped his paddle at the stern called for more speed

faster nick sandy macleod said not later than the
twentieth not later than the twentieth youre sure
today is just the nineteenth

todays the nineteenth aint it nick kelsos lips

curled under his grizzled beard he swung his paddle

  we made it aint nobody passed us yet an nobody
likely to unless its that six-paddle canoe cornin up over
yonder

  the older mountain man chuckled as he flipped his
paddle spray back to their quarter an shes a compny
express less im mistook

  the overtaking craft-a long slender dugout with six
paddlers and a helmsman-was undoubtedly one of the
fur companys express canoes especially built for speed-
ing important messages to the companys wide-scattered
posts its six paddles flashing to the helmsmans chant it
came on with white water curling under its bow

  unconsciously garry kent began to dip his own paddle
deeper faster nick kelso gave a grunt gotta make a
race out of it huh well lets show em bar-steaks an
jerky makes better muscle than sweetened grub an trad-
in-post whisky

  under the renewed impetus the light canoe leaped for-
ward the company express could no longer gain a single
inch garry glanced over his shoulder with satisfaction

  one of the upper missouri expresses id swear ive seen
that big dark steersman somewhere before

  nick likewise stole a glance big joe chastain boss cap-
tain of all the upriver fur brigades must be somethin
important to bring sandy macleods right-hand man way
down here on an ornery express

the two craft were nearing the bend rounding it and
despite its six paddles the larger boat began to drop
back nick kelso let out a whoop waving his paddle in
triumph across the stretch of muddy missouri from the
defeated boat came a loud curse half-french half-english

  cant take a lickin huh always knowed there was a
thin streak somewhere in that brigade boss nick kelso
snorted contemptuously faced ahead-and held his pad-
dle frozen in sheer amazement

  lordamighty what is it-the ocean

  rounding the bend they had come to the junction of
two mighty rivers where the muddier water of the
missouri met the clearer mississippi there was a line of
cleavage almost as bold as a painted mark and along that
mark bobbed countless drifting logs marshaled here by the
eddies of the meeting currents

  garry kent too held his paddle in the awe that the
sight never failed to force upon him

  so fascinated were they that they gave little heed to the
driftwood around them or to the company express be-
hind it was only when a great gnarled limb rose before
them and then splatted heavily that nick kelso came
belatedly out of his trance

  cottonwood swing left-swing left hard he yelled
garry kent dipped his paddle glanced hurriedly around
and then his yell was even louder than kelsos behind
look out behind

  there not thirty feet away and coming up at rushing
speed was the express its sharp bow pointed straight at
the smaller canoe its helmsmans dark face grinning ex-
ultantly as he held his steering paddle deep

  even as he had shouted nick kelso had thrust deep
put his whole weight and strength into his stroke the
paddle bent quivered and broke with a loud crack

  the light canoe now unbalanced with only its stern
paddle working swung around swept almost broadside
down toward where the forked cottonwood was again roll-

ing its limbs high those limbs seemed to reach for them

  pinched between those forks and that onrushing bow
the little canoe would have splintered like matchwood
nick kelso cursed from the rushing express came a
mocking laugh

  but garry kent too had dipped deep now he backed
water with the full weight of his body as the canoe
stern stopped and the bow began to swing around he
whipped his blade to the opposite side and stroked with
all his might

  not around the drifting cottonwood but straight toward
it he shot the canoe-straight toward a little space where
he had noted the trunk curved just short of the forks

  there was a sucking gurgle around and beneath them-
the barest grating jar as they slid above and over-and
then they were across and on the downstream side while
the express shot around the forks and on and past above
its paddles clunking came the parting jeer what you
want the whole river dont you know company express
when you see one

  frozen in his seat in the drifting canoe nick kelso sat
staring then he suddenly threw away the broken piece of
ash still in his hands grabbed in the bottom of the canoe
with a roar

  damn hog damn dirty half-canuck hog he done
it a-purpose he done it a-purpose 

  barely in time garry jammed his foot down on the rifle
stock held it pinned to the bottom on purpose why
should he

  he could see that cottonwood snapped the old moun-
tain man anyway there was plenty room for him to
pass outside wasnt there	

  garry kent did not answer he was staring after the
speeding express a look of perplexity furrowing his brow
maybe-maybe that was what sandy macleod-

  talk louder whatd ye say kelso stopped cursing
to listen

  but garry clamped his lips shut shook his head noth-
ing except that if we dont start paddling again we wont
get in before dark he tossed to kelso the spare paddle

 fter another score of miles the roofs and walls and
lofty steeples of st louis came into sight and kelso
stared why theres more lodges here than there is in
the whole blackfoot country

  now somewhat to his own amazement garry found
himself in the midst of a number of small boats that had
put out from the bank they were all crowded and all
aboard were staring toward the south

  and then garry kent saw the reason for it coming
upstream was a sturdy side-wheeler smoke belching from
her stacks flags fluttering from her staffs by the gleam-
ing white paint and gilt lettering on her paddle-boxes she
was evidently fresh from her builders on the distant ohio
and the small boats had come out to welcome her on her
maiden voyage

  the cheyenne turning from her gilded name to
the lettering on the flags garry let out an exclamation
why shes a company boat she belongs to the american
fur company

  suddenly nick kelsos great bellow drowned him out
frenchy lenoir its frenchy lenoir from pierres hole
or i dont know buffalo bull from fat cow hi frenchy
long time no see

  it was at the nearest boat a small dugout with two
roll missouri



men that he was looking and not at the steamer at his
bellow the black-haired black-bearded giant in the stern
looked over

  nom de dieu if it ain ol neek xhe grinned back
wot you do here neek come see new compny boat

non

  come to see somebody chaw the ears off yuh an stomp
the ree-mains retorted nick yuh aint boss o the
missouri no more theres another young fella thats
holdin the title now won it last christmas shindig at
pierres hole agin all comers

  nother fella boss o the missouri lenoir scowled
held out both fists ferociously wot the name o this
young snapper-whip show me to heem an i eat heem
alive-whooj like dat

  kelso winked at garry names kent-garry kent-
an hes shore hell on wheels so yuh better pull in yore
horns a whole lot about the missouri even if yuh cn bam-
boozle these here steamboat men

the other boats were scattering now opening out before
j- the oncoming steamboat with steam built up till the
safety valve roared she threshed onward the brown water
curling before her sharp bow with its overhanging landing
stage with three deft strokes garry kent sent the light
canoe dancing clear

  but frenchy lenoir stood upright in his dugout al-
most in the steamers path shaking his clenched fist at it
in defiance

  to hell weeth all steamboat me frenchy lenoir boss
o the missouri i ask you come down off the boat an
fight

  garry kent laughed-until his glance fell on the chey-
ennes deck forward

  there standing close beside a big red-headed man in
mates cap was a girl in a red jacket and white dress her
raven hair was flying in the breeze which had wrapped
her clothing so closely about her that against the sunset
her young curved figure was silhouetted like a statue

  she could not have been a month over sixteen and so
close was she that garry could see her excited face the
curve of her parted lips then she glanced his way and
the curve became a smile that all but took his breath
away

   it was but a fleeting smile for she quickly turned again
to glance ahead at the bellowing frenchman in his tiny
craft at the same time the red-headed mate let out an angry
bawl get outa the way yuh damn fool

   then all in one brief instant the smile left the girls face
she caught at the landing stage ropes and gave a scream
following her glance garry kent shouted in sudden
alarm

  too long had the boaster in his dugout stood shout-
ing defiance the oncoming steamboat was a scant half-
length away when he realized droppeddown and grabbed
for his paddle two mighty strokes he gave but they were
not enough

  the end of the dugout was blanked out of sight by the
steamboats stage and flaring bow the other end into
which both paddlers were now crowded careened high in
air over it rolled-once twice-then plunged completely
from sight

  there was shouting cursing from the decks then the
thud of splintering wood as the paddle-buckets churned
relentlessly on

amosy majtcb  m

arry kent and nick kelso had not waited for all
that with deep-dug paddles they were hurling their
own light canoe ahead almost directly at the great wheel-
boxes themselves the curling waves from the bow and the
threshing paddles tossed them slewed them like a chip

   only the skill of an expert riverman could have kept
them upright in that welter of water but upright they
remained almost in the wake of the churning paddle-
buckets when the cheyenne had surged on and past

   splintered bits of wood a broken paddle bobbed up and
swirled in the eddying foam then one black head-
another-came to the surface and thrashing arms and
legs

 nick kelso reached out caught one flounderer drew
him aboard it was the frenchmans bow-paddler but
the other head had bobbed up only to go down again
garry kent caught it just in time by the long flowing
hair as it came up again

   even then it took all his strength and skill plus nick
kelsos to haul the luckless frenchman aboard without
capsizing

  frenchy lenoir seemed drowned half dead and there
was a great swelling bruise on his forehead but to
garrys amazement after a second lenoir blinked shiy-
ered sat u and spat out a mixture of curses and muddy
river water

   by damn i keel heem for dat  he roared glancing at
the departing steamboat that was now swinging in for her
landing she don fight she run me over the giant
frenchman spat out a stream of half-french half-indian
and glared again then all at once he chuckled and beat
his fist on the canoe gunwale good ting for frenchy
you be so close

  nick kelso chuckled too but then his brow began to
cloud looks like folks down thisaway dont have no
manners a-tall thats twice today somebody aint give a
damn who he run over or tried to run over

   me i ketch heem ashore im do something about it
the giant lenoir turned anxiously to garry kent you
put me ashore queek please

  but garry kent was already turning the canoe shore-
ward with long deft sweeps of the paddle

chapter ii

this man is master

hphe two rivers saloon on st louis cherry street
boasted that there was no like place of liquid refresh-
ment between the atlantic seaboard and the oregon coun-

   steamboard men from the mississippi and ohio in their
stout shoes and jeans scraped elbows with barbered city
merchants and drummers along the west wall long-haired
trappers from the mountains drank with equally long-
haired keelboaters and engages from the fur posts upriver

  but between mountain men and mississippi men was an
open aisle of demarcation as sharp as that between the
muddy missouri and the clearer mississippi where first
their waters meet

  squaw men and keelboaters bah they wear mocca-
sins because their feet get so knobby from climbing rocks
that they cant wedge em into civilized shoes

jerky even-they have to eat their sop with a spoon
sitting with nick kelso garry kent ignored the jeers
and challenges around him he was worried and uneasy
remembering their nearly fatal encounter with the com-
pany express boat big joe chastain had deliberately at-
tempted to wreck them he was convinced of that but
why was there any connection with the errand on which
sandy macleod had sent him three thousand miles

   so far thered been no chance to find out once ashore in
st louis settlements garry and nick had gone to the
american fur companys headquarters and asked for
pierre chouteau western manager but chouteau had been
out and garry was impatient

  nick kelsos long nose pointed across the saloon if
that aint that murderin half-canuck over there then
im a digger injun

  at a table across among the steamboat men was un-
doubtedly the boss captain of the companys up-river fur
brigades chastains dark handsome face was alight with
eagerness his black eyes flashing he was bending over
talking rapidly to the man opposite him

  and that man was the red-headed mate of the cheyenne
must be matchin coups on the days run-overs
snorted kelso id jest like to wrap my hand in that
long scalplock o hisn jest once

  listening to chastain-besides the big mate-were half
a dozen other rough-garbed men who by their habits were
also steamboat men as they listened they talked among
themselves muttering grumbling their uneasy eyes frown-
ing

  then chastains glance fell upon garry and he nudged
the red-headed mate who also glanced that way

  garry touched nick kelsos arm come on lets get out
of this therell be a roaring brawl any minute

  shore thats what they come here for aint it de-
manded kelso hopefully

  garry shook his head ive got to see pierre chouteau
and i cant get tangled in any saloon fight now
already the big red-headed mate was standing up was
turning their way garrys lips began to tighten his eyes
to narrow watchfully

  but before he could move there was a bellow at the
door and it was thrown open with a rattle and bang and
frenchy lenoir stamped in his buckskin still damp from
its wetting but his face already flushed from many drinks

for a long moment he stood there looking the room
over with a defiant eye then striding to the bar he
slammed down a gold piece reached for a bottle of liquor
and glasses not whisky glasses but full-sized water tum-
blers he filled two almost to the brim and set them back
on the bar with his hand on one he turned to face the
west side of the room

  dat dreenk been for boss of missouri river he an-
nounced me frenchy lenoir for long tam i been boss
of missouri any man here say im liar any man here
wan fight see who still boss of missouri but garry
only shook his head and it was chastain who answered
the frenchman

  im hearing youre not boss of the missouri any more
lenoir he sneered another man took the title away
from you last christmas-whipped all comers at pierres
hole his mouth curling sardonically he suddenly pointed
his finger and there he is sitting right there garry
kent

  at the words frenchy lenoir glared whirled his big

lumbering body around his scowling eyes fell on garry

  hah so you theenk you boss of missouri now eh
you get up i show you plenty queek by damn

  sudden silence had fallen on the room all eyes were
turned on garry garry could feel them and could feel
the sudden pounding in his own temples but he slowly
shook his head

  not now lenoir some other time maybe-the christ-
mas shindig at pierres hole but not now

  frenchy lenoir looked incredulous you not fight
he said by damn somebody been pool my leg hi
belligerent glance swept the other mountain men no
body here wan give me leetle fight nobody here wan
fight see who dreenk dis whisky

  when there was no answer except more muttering the
giant frenchman swung around downed the first tumbler
of whisky with one gulp ha den frenchy lenoir he
dreenk eet then he touched the other tumbler faced
toward the east side of the room

  dis other dreenk she been for boss of mississippi
river me frenchy lenoir-i say im boss of mississippi
river too im best damn man on both river any man
here say im lie dere too

  the red-headed mate was easily the biggest man among
those on that side and men began to look that way some
of the steamboat men even began to call out get up an
whip im mattoon stomp the damn keelboaterl show
him no mountain man cn stand up to a steamboater

mattoon the mate was hesitant but the shouts
had turned lenoirs attention that way his eyes
widened and then they fairly glared why you been
damn steamboater dat run me over but now i ketch
you on land eef you don fight i wheep you anyway
by damn

  hemmed in by the crowded tables behind the mate of
the cheyenne stood up his eyes flickered from chastain
to the big frenchman waiting he shrugged his shoul-
ders

  im not here long enough to be reglar mississip but
no damn mountain man can whip a steamboater he
pushed forward reached his hand out toward the full
tumbler

   eagerly lenoir watied for the fingers to touch the glass
one leetle dreenk-just take one leetle dreenk he
pleaded

   but instead of lifting the glass to his lips thg red-head
suddenly whirled and dashed the stinging contents full into
lenoirs face and while the frenchman pawed half-
blinded mattoon sprang in sending two sledge-hammer
fists full into the frenchmans face

  as lenoir stumbled back blood streaming from lips and
nose a howl of anger rose from the mountain men in
spite of himself garry kent half arose the dirty fight-
er the dirty scut but nick kelso held him down

  it aint over yet wait it aint over yet

  twice more the mates fists hammered home and
frenchy lenoir reeled back two steps more but when
mattoon eagerly closed in lenoir shook himself and moved
suddenly into action

  but it was his feet and not his fists that moved with
incredible agility as light as a cat despite his huge bulk
he sprang into air and at the same time one huge moc-
casined foot shot out straight at the mates head
roll missouri



  had lenoir been shod with heavy-heeled boots like the
eastern men mattoons jaw would have been broken even
if his neck had not been as it was even with the softer
buckskin mattoon was spun half around his head twisted
sideways and blood spurting from the earlobe half tom from
its moorings

  and with huge hands outclutching like grizzly claws
lenoir rushed in and fastened a tremendous bear-grip on
his opponent

a t touch of lenoirs arms mattoon threw out his
own encircled the frenchman in a similar grip
locked and straining they stood while their corded muscles
stood out like lumps and the veins in their foreheads pulsed
full and purple

  then slowly the giant frenchmans power told mattoon
gave way a foot-two feet and with a sudden rush le-
noir shoved him back into a table from which the drink-
ers hastily sprang

  with a splintering crash the table gave way under their
weight and amid broken planks and spilled bottles and
glasses the two bodies rolled and struggled

  slowly frenchy lenoir worked on top he freed one
hand caught the mate by the thick red mop of hair ha 
he panted you not in beeg boat now an me in dug-
out now we see who boss of river

  it was at that moment that one of the other steamboat
men reached out grabbed the frenchmans leg pulled him
off and under while still a third raised a deadly broken
table-leg to strike

  nick kelso screeched behind him a mountain man
gave the wild scream of a catamount but it was garry
kent who yelled the loudest his fighting blood up and
everything else forgotten in his rage and indignation
mountn men mountn men up and at em

  as at a signal the whole mountain side of the room rose
and surged forward to meet steamboat men who were no
less willing

  garry swung at the man with the upraised table-leg
and at the same time was knocked half off his feet by a
clout on the ear he stumbled went down amid a mass
of threshing bodies the table leg thudded down on his
shoulder numbing it jerking the club away with his good
hand he laid a scalp wide open with it

  then a full whisky bottle whizzed past garrys ear and
splintered against the solid bar with a crash that would
have shattered any skull whirling garry glimpsed chas-
tain his lips twisted his right arm still extended from the
throw

  with a lunge garry came to his feet and plunged that
way chastain twisted like a cat however and slipped
through the crush of fighting men that was jamming the
door when garry finally fought his way through the
fur brigade captain was nowhere in sight

  but there were others in the street from every doof and
window of the two rivers knots of kicking clawing com-
batants were erupting only to renew their fighting more
fiercely in the open street outside with shouts of moun-
tns mountns and steam-m-boat steam-m-boat
fresh partisans on both sides were running up to hurl them-
selves into the fray

f arry suddenly found himself alongside nick kelso
 nicks left eye was swollen to match garrys right
and his nose was even bloodier but his face was aglow

with enjoyment nice fightin he panted he grinned

  garry shook his head wiped the dirt and sweat away
im a fool tangling in a barroom brawl when ive got
sandy macleods business still to do come on weve got
to find pierre chouteau

  then he saw that nicks mouth was gaping his eyes
staring at something back of his own shoulder for cats
sake gasped nick whats a gal like that doing down
here

  turning garry saw the girl of the red jacket almost
within hands reach the same girl he had seen with the
red-headed mate on the deck of the cheyenne kicking
feet had splashed mud on her dress and her eyes were
staring at the riot with both fascination and horror

  oh she gasped oh-the brutes

  she seemed to be held in a kind of paralysis her horror
kept her motionless

  get out of here havent you any sense snapped
garry with crisp impatience this is steamboat row
and its no place for ladies

  her face flushed at sight of the blood and dirt on his
face and torn buckskin she took a half step backward in
disgust dont you talk like that to me she flared

  garry kents own temper rose the least i can do i
reckon is to take you out of here and back to your people
who ought to have more sense-

  dont you touch me she drew back gasping

  garry was just reaching out to carry his threat into
effect however when with a sudden yelp nick kelso went
down his ankle clawed from under him by one of the
fighters in the rolling heap nearest and when garry
looked the enemy had not only rolled the surprised moun-
tain man on his back but was sitting on his chest gouging
at his mouth and eyes with clawing talons

  with one leap garry landed on the gouging steamboat
mans neck and shoulders he hurled him sideways rocked
him with hammering fists and then pounded his head on
the ground until the subdued steamboater groaned out a
choking submission

  nick kelso got up and calmly dusted off his buckskins
reckon ill go along with ye he declared ive had
enough but whereat is that baggage

  when garry looked there was no sight of the girl she
had evidently fled

  by now that whole section of the city was in turmoil
honest citizens were shouting police call the police
the clatter of hoofs came pounding over the uneven ground

dut it was no police that came it was merely a two-
horse carriage its horses dancing and the wheels lurch-
ing as the negro driver lashed them right through the
midst of the fray fighters broke apart and rolled hurriedly
to safety in the very midst of the street the carriage
stopped and the lone figure in the carriage seat flecked
the ash from his cigar and for the first time raised his voice
stop he ordered stop this foolishness

  and though a hundred policemen would have had their
hands full yet at this one mans voice the fighting stopped
for every man there knew that carriage that man-knew
that here was pierre chouteau

 the american fur company-the company-could
make or break any man on the river or west of it and
pierre chouteau western headquarters manager for the
company controlled more territory than president andrew
jackson


argosy

  now standing up in the carriage and holding his cigar
in one hand his gold-headed cane in the other pierre
chouteau looked around and his glance fell on the red-
headed mate mattoon sitting on the curb and wiping his
bleeding ear

  mattoon when the captain of one of my boats is sick
i dont expect to find the mate drinking and fighting in a
barrel-house gather your men and get back aboard the
cheyenne at once be ready to sail at daybreak

  mattoon surlily stood up and vanished in the crowd
but from somewhere in the outskirts came the jeering an-
swer sail at daybreak she wont never sail not up the
missouri she wont

  pierre chouteau turned as quick as a flash i know
thats what theyre saying and id give a thousand dollars
to catch the fellow who started it but the companys
steamer cheyenne is sailing tomorrow at daybreak and
shes going all the way up the missouri to council bluffs
and even fort tecumseh

  agin all them sandbars snags flood-chutes an whirl-
pools safe in the shadowy outskirts of the crowd the
unseen speaker jeered again no steamer aint never goin
up the missouri god never meant her for no steamboat
river else why aint steamboats been goin up her before
like up the mississip

  and now another heckler joined the first not a heap
o junk like the cheyenne noway for the first time
pierre chouteaus eyes narrowed but his voice remained
cool and level the cheyenne is the staunchest-built
steamboat that ever came off the ways

  he let his eyes roam over the whole crowd to prove
what im saying im going upriver on the cheyenne my-
self and that isnt all ill hereby offer to take the first
ten passengers that apply all the way up and back for five
dollars a head-and pay any man ten dollars for every
mile he has to walk either way now does that sound like
the cheyenne is unsafe

  the bold offer silenced even the hecklers the fur man-
ager pressed his advantage home ill be at the company
office until midnight to sign on any man who wants to go
on the cheyenne either as a member of the crew or as
passenger then he sank back onto the seat waved his
cigar at the coachman drive on elijah

  with the crack of the coachmans whip the horses
plunged against their harness the carriage lurched and
rocked ahead at a reckless pace

  nick kelso gazed after it with blinking eyes them as
wants to go cn go me i wouldnt travel on one o them
biler-bustin devils tea-kettles for fifty dollars a mile 
hey where yuh goin

  to see pierre chouteau garry kent was already
settling into a rapid trot and weve got to hurry

chapter iii

invitation to a hanging

in the outer office of the american fur company the
creole clerk stood up to stop them boat crew or
passengers he inquired this way ill sign you on for
either one

  but garry kent had seen the curl of smoke sniffed the
odor of cigar he shoved past toward the doorway leading
into the main office ive a message for monsieur chou-
teau-personally

  inside the large room were half a dozen desks a huge
safe and still another door leading to a lighted private
room beyond pushing papers into the safe pigeonholes
was a gray-headed stoop-shouldered clerk

  but behind the big desk in the far corner of the room
bending over a huge map spread out on the desk-top was
pierre chouteau he straightened up you have a message
for me

  garry nodded im garry kent from the upper sweet-
water and this is nick kelso i have a private message
for you from alexander macleod

  sandy macleod pierre chouteau started shot a
quick glance toward the gray-haired clerk step outside
jacques

  when the old clerk had stepped out and closed the door
behind him pierre chouteau turned to garry again an-
other message that is odd what is it

  unstoppering his powder horn garry shook out a tiny
rolled paper unrolled it and placed it in the managers
hand then he stood waiting quietly

  but pierre chouteau when he glanced at the scrawled
words was so amazed that he unconsciously read the words
aloud  this is the man you need signed sandy mac-
leod his eyes shot up toward garry black and flashing
you got this from sandy macleod where

  on the upper sweetwater as i said beyond the devils
gate macleod was a sick man so sick that he could
scarcely hold a pen but he told me to put it in your
hands before the twentieth at latest

  macleod sick what of the words were like rattljng
shot

  fever and mountain ague-though i think it was also
worry that sickened him garrys words were crisp in
his fever tossing he kept mumbling about trouble-big
trouble too many outsiders coming in and to tell pierre
chouteau he must not fail

  outsiders pierre chouteau gripped the desk until his
fingers whitened he said that but nothing about the
trouble-what sort of trouble

  nothing i could understand garry shook his head
only mumblings he was a very sick man then the
voyageurs were making ready to carry him back to fort
tecumseh when i left

ddly pierre chouteaus fingers relaxed though they
were still quivering his eyes seemed to search every
inch of garrys face he gave you no other orders told
you nothing of why you must be here by the twentieth
nothing except that i was to bring this message to you
and that then i was to bring you and your party back up-
river

  guide us up-river pierre chouteau let out an ex-
clamation you know the river then you are a pilot
i have made ten trips up and down the western river
both keel-boat and canoe garry shrugged his shoulders
but no man knows gods practice river he builds new
bars cuts new chutes across the bends-makes it anew
every flood

  nick kelso for the first time spoke up mebbe so
but if theres any man knaws the missouri bettern my
pardner here im willin to swaller him whole without even
greasin his hair

  pierre choteaus eyes and ears were only for garry how-
ever but two messages-two pilots i do not under-
stand what time did you leave the devils gate
roll missouri	

  mid-february about we came as fast as we could
almost three thousand miles since mid-february 
pierre chouteau drew an incredulous breath and you
did all that merely because alexander macleod asked you
to	i

  why not garrys eyes widened in surprise sandy
macleod was my friend-

  he broke off voices had sounded outside the outer
door opened and joe chastain and the mate mattoon
bulged in the doorway chastains eyes flicked lightning-
like taking in the scene then with a quick easy smile
he advanced to the managers desk

  we came to tell you monsieur chouteau that the
cheyenne is all ready to sail at daybreak with a full crew
all but the passengers is there anything else that you
wanted attended to first

  yes pierre chouteaus voice cracked like a whip
let me see that message you brought

with a flickering glance toward garry the brigade
captain took out a paper laid it face up on the desk
the paper slid a vagrant air caught its corner twisted it
about and garrys keen eyes could make out every letter

  pierre chouteau

  st louis

  it is so necessary that the cheyenne reach fort te-
  cumseh that i am sending you for pilot my right-hand
  man joe chastain he is bringing you this message in
  person with all speed you already know him and know
  that you may have full confidence in him but trust no
  one else-no one the cheyenne must come up-river
  this year

                             alexander macleod

  pierre chouteaus narrowed eyes inspected the note
closely then the bearer

  i know you have been macleods assistant and chief
captain of the fur brigades for ten years chastain but
how many times have you been up or down river on keel-
boats or mackinaws

  fifteen times and more monsieur chouteau

  then you know the river

  chastain held up his hand the fingers outspread like
i know my own fingers 

  garry kents eyes began to glow and nick kelso make
a grunting noise in his throat if this murderin half-
canuck is a pilot-

  but pierre chouteau had lifted his voice jacques
when the stoop-shouldered clerk appeared pierre chou-
teau held out the second message to him whose signa-
ture is that jacques

  monsieur macleods the clerk inspected it looked
up with surprise why

  and this one-whose signature is that pierre chou-
teau handed over the brief scrawl that garry had given
him

  the clerk looked at it a long time then shook his head
le ne sais pas alexander macleods-maybe yes maybe
no	

  you may go jacques pierre chouteaus eyes burned
with sudden light as he turned back to chastain you say
you know the river but do you know this man here
and he jerked his thumb toward garry

  chastains lips curled slightly i know that his name is
garry kent and that he is a trouble-maker like all free

trappers are his cold eyes surveyed garry kent

  free trapper the fur company manager jumped as
if a snake had bitten him

  garry kents words were slow icy yes i am a free
trapper monsieur chouteau except when i deal with
sandy macleod who pays fair prices but rather than
deal with some of the cheating factors of the companys
posts i would throw my pelts into the river first

  at the hated words free trapper though pierre chou-
teau had leaped up his latin temper boiling you sell
to the hudsons bay company-you sell to canada men
-and you have the impudence to come here with your
lying message get out

  nick kelso thrust his jaw forward his grizzled beard
quivering dont you call my pardner no liar an we
never sold to canady garry brung our pelts down-river-
i said get out

cuddenly from the private room beyond the office
 came a lilting feminine laugh fie pierre chouteau
you swear because i do not wait at the boat but walk
and so happen onto a street brawl-and now you lose your
temper like any brawling trapper yourself

  the gibe improved pierre chouteaus temper no whit
hush up have you not caused enough worry already
back to your hotel you go at once as soon as i can take
you there and if you set foot out of it before the chey-
enne sails you will not go up-river on the cheyenne at all
i will pack you bag and baggage back to boston-and
tell sandy macleod that he can fetch you from there him-
self if he wants you

  and fie again you are a big adorable fraud pierre
chouteau uncle sandy has written me too much about
you i know your bark is worse than your bite

  there was the sound of tapping heels the flash of red
at the inner door then the girl of the boat stood in the
doorway her laughing eyes glanced about the room and
then stopped on garry oh-h

  pierre chouteau looked at her you know this man
her flashing eyes met garrys for a full second then they
flamed her cheeks flushed and her chin tilted

  he is the street brawler the leader of the men who
attacked the steamboat crew i saw him with my own
eyes-and this other ruffian with him

  pierre chouteaus flaming eyes were on garry

  so that is it you not only try to get aboard the chey-
enne through a lying message but you try to get the regu-
lar crew beaten up in a street brawl as well so that they
cant sail with her

  well go back to your employers and tell them you are
found out and tell them the cheyenne sails at daybreak
and will reach fort tecumseh if i have to have gamble my
life on it

  then you think my message is a lie asked garry kent
i am not to take you up-river as sandy macleod asked
you should know yourself after this

  garry coolly took out a gold coin from his buckskin
pouch here is five dollars then i am paying my way
on the cheyenne as a passenger

  you cant buy a passage on any company boat for any
amount of money

  you agreed to take the first ten passengers that applied
-and to pay them ten dollars a mile for every mile the
cheyenne failed to take them it is over a thousand miles
to fort tecumseh-and i am holding you to your offer
 

argosy

  ten dollars a mile-a thousand miles pierre chou-
teau gaped then his jaws snapped shut come in tomor-
row morning at nine and your money will be ready for you
garry nodded my partner nick kelso here-he was
going with me that will be ten dollars a mile for him also
if he does not go on the cheyenne

  hey nick kelso suddenly gasped in alarm them
devils tea-kettles-

  his money will be ready for him tomorrow also
pierre chouteaus jaws clamped obstinately and now
get out

  still smiling garry touched nicks arm come nick

a s they passed into the little front office nick kelsos
eyes were bulging twenty thousand dollars for not
ridin on that devils biler when i wouldnt ride it noway
for fifty thousand lordamighty jest wait till i git to
the two rivers

 pierre chouteau seems to think it worth it not to have
us on the cheyenne

  but whats she carryin that makes im so techy an
skeery-the united states mint hey where yuh headin
for garry had turned toward the creoles counter

  to finish up sandy macleods errand

  but there was somebody else already at the counter be-
fore them frenchy lenoirs big bulk loomed his big
voice sounded you sure that red-head mate go up on
cheyenne too

  of course the mate goes with the boat the creole
impatiently opened a book of blank slips you say you
want passage on her the name please

  frenchy lenoir an here is five dollaire lenoir
fumbled at his torn buckskins

  goin back up to get whupped next christmas shindig
at pierres hole chuckled nick kelso

  huh lenoir snorted im be there-but i got leetle
unfeenesh business to tend to first and lenoir tramped
outside

  garry kent likewise placed five dollars on the counter
im taking passage up on the cheyenne too to fort
tecumseh the name is kent-garry kent

  nick kelso gaped as the creole wrote the name and
then the words one passage on steamer cheyenne on the
receipt form and pushed it carelessly across

  garry turned held out his hand well tyick-ill be
seeing you again some time on the sweetwater i hope
meantime dont try to drink the whole of st louis dry
st louis hell nick kelso likewise turned to the
creole gimme one o them slips jest like that un the
name is nick kelso

  but you said you wouldnt ride a steamboat for any
money gasry looked his surprise dont be a fool
youve got ten thousand dollars coming tomorrow just for
the asking

  nick snorted dont like them devils kettles an never
will thats why im goin with ye ye dont think im
the sort o man to let his pardner git hisself blowed to
kingdom come all by hisself do yuh

  for a long moment garry looked at the old mountain
man a husky note was in his voice when he spoke i
might have known come on then

  to nick kelsos surprise it was not toward the street
door that he led the way however but back to pierre
chouteaus office pierre chouteaus mouth dropped open
as they pushed their way inside

shoving the clerks receipt across the desk garry kent
looked pierre chouteau in the eye you should have
spoken to your clerk outside as well as to me monsieur
chouteau because he has just sold us passenger tickets
up-river on the cheyenne

   passenger tickets the fur company manager knocked
the receipt from the desk-top the company clerks do
not own the company boats ive said you can come in
for your money tomorrow if you set foot in here again
before that i-ill have you thrown out

   very well well go then-and be back for the money
tomorrow garry kents ups were smiling but his eyes
were deep and grim

   but also well spread the word in the two rivers-and
in every other saloon and trading post between here and
the sweetwater-that pierre chouteaus word is no goodl
that he publicly offered passenger tickets for sale up-river
on the cheyenne and then refused to honor them
what my word no good pierre chouteau almost
choked then with a crash he brought his fist down on
the desk be on the dock tomorrow at five the cheyenne
sails at daylight but i warn you if you make any trouble
if you interfere in the slightest ill hang you from the
nearest tree

   with nick kelso mumbling behind him garry strode
out of the office and closed the door

   from beyond that closed door came angry voices chas-
tains deep curse-and then a girls sudden rippling laugh

chapter iv

deep-water threat

the missouri is two thousand miles long the cheyenne
was a scant hundred and thirty-two feet her eighteen-
foot side-wheels were driven by a single engine with a huge
fly wheel to prevent stopping on dead center with both
paddle-wheels on the same shaft she could turn only by
rudder which meant taking bends wide and laboriously

   at the end of a week nick kelso spat disgustedly meb-
beso that steamboat fella was right god didnt mean this
for no steamboat river why theres bars an bends a-comin
that we wont git past without hinges on both sides an
her bottom not with this captain and crew we wont
garrys opinion of the cheyennes captain was no better
than nicks

   captain waters was a gaunt sallow-faced individual
whose drooping shoulders and worried cough already
showed signs of some deep-rooted disease a deep-water
man with previous river experience only on new orleans
 packets and the cheyennes single trip down the ohio he
had been sent out by the companys new york office

   dunbar the scotch engineer looked honest but his long
whiskers rarely appeared away from his engine and the
twin boilers stoked by the negro firemen on the open
boiler-deck just beneath the pilot house

   the only other ships officers were mattoon the mate
and chastain the pilot

   you dont know any of the crew or passengers garry
looked aft from the bow over the hodge-podge of men scat-
tered with their belongings over the whole forward deck
you never saw any of them before in the mountains
beaver butler an si pearson is aboard gittin cheap
passage back as meat-hunters theyre free-trappers from
the north forks but likely that creole clerk didnt know
roll missouri



that else they wouldnt have got aboard this boat
nick kelso chuckled id as lief have them to my back
in a scrap as any course theres frenchy lenoir but i
spect the unfinished business that brung him along is to
lick any and ary man on the boat or the river

  mattoon must a picked the rest of em from the two
rivers an worse i never seen a primer passel o human
scum unhung wouldnt sprise me a bit if they tried to
steal the cheyenne right out from under pierre chouteau
but what would they want with it what good would
it do them

  i dunno unless its somethin down in them two cargo
holds theyre after an theyre both locked

   see if you can fnd out whats in them directed garry
find out anything you can about either the crew or cargo
ill keep an eye on the mate and pilot

  ill keep both eyes peeled-one for snakes an tother
for buzzards promised the old mountain man but yuh
aint said nothin at all about the worst pizen of all that
gal she cant git two feet without that half-canuck
nudgin her elbow an whisperin to her ear

   it was a fact except for what little time the girl spent
in her tiny cabin aft chastain was always at her elbow
whenever she was in the pilot house which was most of the
daylight hours it set garrys blood boiling even though
captain waters and pierre chouteau were also there

  if jeannie macleod knew of garrys and nicks pres-
ence aboard however the only indication was an extra tilt
to her nose when she passed them but chastain and mat-
toon gave the mountain men scowls at every encounter

  biler blow-up or scalp-liftin-only difference seems
to be which is goin to come first said nick kelso gloom-
ily my scalp aint felt so loose an itchy since the crows
treed me at frenchmans fork

ttor almost another week however the cheyenne dipped
her paddle-buckets deep into the muddy missouri and
churned upstream without mishap each evening at sun-
set she tied up at the bank to replenish her firewood and
lay over until daybreak for not even a bull-boat would
have run that bar-trapped snag-infested river after dark

  and long before the cheyenne started again at day-
break the hunters butler and pearson were away and
working the thickets ahead for game hanging their meat on
saplings along the bank to be picked up by the steamboats
yawl as she came abreast

  now they left the hillier stretches and began to thread
their way through the great flood-plains themselves plains
so level save for occasional ridges and wooded streams
that in the missouris built-up bed the steamboat seemed
to be churning almost overland itself and from her elevated
pilot house the eye could see for countless leagues on either
side leagues where the only moving things were the brown
buffalo herds and the occasional indians who stared in awe
and then bent over their ponies necks and fled in wild
panic from this fire-breathing monster

  now too they began to pass the first of the down-river
boats bullboats made of buffalo bull hides stretched over
willow poles and drawing bare inches of water mackinaw
boats flat-bottomed fifty-feet long keelboats half as long
as the cheyenne herself with raised cargo box standing
five feet above the narrow walk along the gunwales where
stood the pole-men when poling

  and at each boat as it passed pierre chouteau looked
long and anxiously yet each time with apparent disappoint-

ment his face was drawn with worry his body tense

  whatever hes looking for it must be important ob-
served nick kelso and garry noted that though most
of the boats were platte or lower missouri craft it was
at the upper river boats that the fur manager looked most
anxiously

  why was pierre chouteau so anxious why was he in
such desperate haste to get the cheyenne up-river to fort
tecumseh had gold been discovered on the headwaters
or could it be indian uprisings

  for a time the next day garry thought the last guess
had been right

  beaver butler and si pearson had gone ahead as usual
hunting yet even before noon hours too early garry saw
them standing on the bank meatless but yelling and wav-
ing their hats

injuns said nick kelso as the yawl shot out to fetch
the hunters aboard and he began freshing his priming

  but no sooner was he aboard than beaver butler raced
for the pilot-house ladder yelling at every jump git in to
the bank git in to the west bank-an tie up as quick
as the lord ull let yuh hell is a-goin to bust loose look
over yander

a nd looking garry saw what had previously been invis-
ible from the low deck over there low down the
whole western sky was a blotch of inky black yet every
second it rolled higher nearer shooting spurts of ugly
yellowish-black from its edges like the fringes of a ragged
hunting jacket

  captain waters sallow face looked amazedly out of the
pilot-house door tie up for that little thunder-head
the cheyenne doesnt have to tie up for every passing
shower

  hell think its raining cottonwoods before its over
garry pulled nick toward the pilot-house ladder weve
got to find pierre chouteau that captain never saw a
missouri storm before

  pushing his way through the pilot-house door garry
found himself close on beaver butlers heels beaver but-
ler was shaking his fist howling in surprise and anger

  aint ye got no eyes an ears ye idjit i said git in to
the west bank an git in in a hurry

  captain waters blinked his jaws set obstinately no
tramping meat-hunter can tell me how to run a ship
shallow water youre crazy the only safety in a blow
is deep water im sticking to the deepest part of the
channel

  beaver butler turned to chastain yore the pilot yuh
know damn well she oughta be in an tied up

  but chastain only shrugged his shoulders ive told the
captain it blows hard here sometimes but he should know
best hes an old sailor and the captain

  for gawds sake  beaver butler suddenly caught sight
of garry kent he whirled on the captain if ye wont
believe merest ask this fella here hes been up th river
time enough hell tell yuh

  at that moment a shoulder edged garry aside and pierre
chouteaus voice spoke up what is it whats tle trou-
ble captain

  th rain-squall this man here says- began the
capnn and then chastains smooth voice cut in ive
told haii it blows hard here monsieur chouteau i was
just about to advise that we head in and tie up to the
bank until it is over


argosy

  garry gaped nick nelso swore but pierre chouteau
after one look to the west let out an exlamation youre
right chastain put in captain-put in and tie up we
cant risk the cheyenne in a missouri storm

  by now even the captain was beginning to look dubious
worried the whole western sky almost to the zenith was
a welter of darkness his sallow face whitened captain
waters let out a bawl to the mate and men forward to get
the mooring lines ready then he jangled the bell for full
speed

  churning and splashing the cheyenne began to angle
in toward the west bank

tut before she was half-way there a bitter blast as from
the north pole swept down over the crew and passen-
gers the waters of the river began to whip into frothing
crests while at the same time weirdly enough the icy-cold
air was filled with driven sand and even gravel whirled
from the treeless plains to the west and driven before the
blast with stinging fury

  captain waters coughing vojce seemed thin and whin-
ing i dont see nothin to tie up to but that point up
ahead-once we make it around that mebbe therell be
trees and stumps to tie up to

  once around that point and shed be almost blown out
of water cried garry grimly but on the bank over
there- look those scrub cedars-its them or nothing
ill go down on deck and show the men where

  and without waiting for the captains bleat of surprise
or chastains quick curse he jerked the pilot-house door
open and started down the ladder

  almost at the foot of it he ran full intothe girl jeanne
macleods red jacket was plastered against her body her
black hair was flying in the wind but her face was flushed
her eyes were sparkling she laughed excitedly at garry
isnt it grand

  the next moment garrys hand snatched out grabbed
the sleeve of the red jacket whirled her forcibly about
get out of the way-get off the deck he bellowed this
is a missouri storm get below to your cabin quick
what for a second she stared how dare you
speak to me like that as tempestuous as the storm it-
self she raised her hand gave him a solid stinging slap
on the cheek take your hands off me

  fool with one surge of his shoulders garry swept
her up into his arms despite her twisting and clawing
like a cat he raced aft to a lashed heap of cargo next to
her small cabin and dropped her behind it

  and in that instant all hell seemed to burst loose over
the cheyenne

  rain hammered like buckshot in such torrents that it
was near impossible to breathe without strangling the
first great gust struck the wheel-boxes and elevated pilot
house like a giant hammer tilting them over as the solid
timbers creaked and groaned then the rain changed to
ice and hail-stones as big as marbles began to crash and
rebound from decks and cabins

  without a seconds pause garry whirled again raced
forward with nick kelso now at his heels as they passed
the open boiler space the smudged face of dunbar the
engineer looked out at them wildly

  the stacks is down he yelled cant keep steam
up

  stacks or no stacks youve got to keep steam up
snarled garry nick stick here with the engineer

  without waiting for answer he plunged ahead out into
the open forward deck men were clustered there strug-
gling aimlessly with the stout mooring lines and gazing
despairingly at the western bank

chapter v

next time is for keeps

pvespite her churning straining paddles the cheyenne
seemed almost hove-to in the water she quivered and
reeled at every wailing swoop of the storm which had built
itself in countless miles of open prairie to hurl itself finally
on the luckless cheyenne

  wheres mattoon wheres the mate

  but there was no sight of the red-headed mate only a
huge figure half-blotted out by the driving rain and hail
turned amid the drenched group and frenchy lenoirs
bull voice bellowed back she don be here an dese
rope she all tangle an snarl wot de hell-

  here-grab driving among the confused deck-hands
garry found the rope end jammed it toward lenoir lead
it out ill keep it running clear

  hah now we get somewhere with a whoop lenoir
dragged the heavy kinking coils out out wit de rope
queek or i beat you me frenchy lenoir-boss o the
missouri river

  he set to work with a fury shouting his great hands
moving with lightning speed

  but even with the ropes out and clear for mooring there
was still open water yawning between the cheyennes bow
and those straggling cedars on the bank-space which the
straining cheyenne seemed unable to decrease

  too wide to jump too deep to wade shrieked the
frenchman in garrys ear me i dont sweem so good
noway i don wan drown tryin to sweem ashore wit
rope

  the landing stage ordered garry get the landing
stage out then itll bridge part of the way

  stage lenoir stared then beat at his thigh by gar
you better steamboat man dan steamboat man herself
whirling he drove the others with fists and howls git
landing-stage out queek or i throw you in river

  with the wind tearing at the planks however it seemed
as impossible to thrust out the stage against the storm as
it was for the cheyenne to make headway against it
lenoirs mighty muscles strained until they ripped the
stout buckskin covering them

  it was only when garry put his own shoulders to the
work that the stage began to creep out inch by inch over
the gap

  then-through nick kelsos help or by some other
miracle-the engineer began to get more power into his
engine and paddle-wheels and inch by inch the chey-
enne fought her way in to the bank the blurred bank
then the cedar scrub showed andstanding on the out-
most edge of the landing stage rope in hand garry jumped

tte was already throwing loop on loop of the stout
hawser about the scrawny cedars when frenchy lenoir
joined him with another rope but glancing at the scraggly
cedars and then back at the cheyenne heeling under the
storm garry shook his head he scrambled back burst
into the pilot house once more

the cedars are too small too scraggly they may not
roll missouri



hold youll have to keep the engine and paddles going
too to help

  captain waters coughed and nodded but his face was
white dazed

  and then garry felt something at his shoulder he
turned gliihpsed a red jacket

  but the eyes that met his white sparkling were no
longer furious and the lips were almost timid

  please its as safe here as there and-and its lonely
down below

  he did not answer for one thing pierre chouteau was
there staring at them puzzledly for another thing garry
had just caught sight of something els rounding the point
ahead something almost blurred out by the rain and
spray

  and then they saw that it was a keelboat

  either it had been torn from its moorings ashore or
else the storm had caught it foolhardly in deep water
where the voyageurs poles would not reach bottom cling-
ing to the sides of the cargo box four men were still vainly
trying to find bottom with their poles and turn the boat
inshore

  at the four bow oars other men were desperately strain-
ing to work the bow around but their work was yain as
was the equal effort of the patron at the steering oar in
the stern for the frightful force of the wind whirled the
keelboat like a cockle-shell driving it almost abreast of the
moored cheyenne and straight down toward a huge matted
pile of drifted logs and tree-trunks protruding like fangs
from a hidden reef	

  those aboard the keelboat had sighted the cheyenne
now for the patrons face turned that way and alongside
him a figure in buckskins reared up waving a hand with
something in it something that looked like a buckskin
pouch

  a fort tecumseh boat pierre chouteaus voice was
broken hoarse a message perhaps from sandy mac-
leod-

  even as pierre chouteau cried out however-even as
garry felt the girls slender fingers clutch at his arm-the
doomed keelboat whirled end for end and drove with shat-
tering force full upon the log fangs it careened tilted
throwing men toppling and overboard

  half of the keelboats bottom showed the planks riven
and splintered then the wreckage whirled off the logs
and on into deeper water and where there had been a
sixty-foot keelboat there bobbed now only a few planks
and bales of goods with one or two black spots that might
have been heads

  the hand clutching the thing that had looked like a
pouch showed for a moment as if vainly reaching for the
cheyenne and then it too vanished

  may the good god have mercy on his soul  said chas-
tain piously but to garry it seemed that the lips curled
about the words sardonically

  then the slender fingers squeezing garrys arm clutched
tighter theyre drowning oh do something

  theres nothing we can do answered garry quietly
the yawl wouldnt live ten feet even if we could get it
into the water

  as the last black spot bobbed up and then was blotted
out captain waters put a shaking hand to his forehead
god what sort of river is this

  what sort of river why this is jest the old missoury
standing at the top of the pilot house ladder nick kelso

chuckled an if you think this is something-yuh aint
seen nothin yet

a s he took counsel with nick kelso on the deck below
-l after the storm with the stackless cheyenne barely
limping upstream garry kents lips were wtyte chastain
could see that coming storm from the pilot house as soon
as beaver butler ashore but to wreck her deliberately
with the girl aboard-

  didnt figger on bustin er on a log-heap in deep
water returned kelso bustin her bow against the
bank would be jest as good-an give him an his pardners
all summer to git outa her whatevers in her way them
eyes o his follers er that ud include the gal

  garrys eyes flashed not while i or pierre chouteau
is alive he wouldnt dare

  who said youd be alive-or me either chastain aint
figgerin it that way i betcha nick kelso grinned wryly
me im sleepin with both eyes open from now on

  by desperate stoking they made fort leavenworth where
the posts blacksmith strapped and bolted the dented stacks
into place once more but the news they heard there was
anything but comforting the april freshets on the lower
feeders had passed and boatmen were bringing in the word
that the upper river was lower than it had been in history
nick kelso contributed something equally disturbing
pierre chouteau sent a messenger up-river a-horseback
at full speed but so did chastain lessn ten minutes after
pierre chouteaus messenger rid off

  not two days out of leavenworth the report of low
water proved true indeed its first flood exhausted the
missouri dwindled to but a shadow of itself threading its
way ardously among so many sand bars and reefs that
nick kelso swore the cheyenne raised dust-clouds

  there was nothing to it but to resort to cordelling the
cordell a thousand-foot hawser that every keelboat or
mackinaw carried for warping over sand-bars was led out
to its very end

  anchoring the shore end to some stout tree or planted
spar ashore the crew would then take up the slack at the
other end on the cheyennes capstan then with engine
panting and paddles threshing while stout arms wound the
capstan round and round the cheyenne would push and
pull herself forward by inches over the bar

  it was slow back-breaking work nick kelso toiling
alongside garry and frenchy lenoir at the capstan wiped
the sweat from his face in disgust that damn half-
canuck we wont never get up in time to make the fort
on the june flood an down again fore freeze up looks
like chastain picks the worst chutes in the bars a-purpose
i think he does said garry quietly but pierre chou-
teaumsnt blind and if chastain tries another trick-like
im hoping-pierre chouteau will know him for what
he is

pierre chouteau was already pacing up and down
restlessly his brow furrowed and black at the slow
progress finally he shouted angrily at chastain in the
pilot house nom de dieu you call yourself a pilot
can you not get her up-river faster

  chastain shrugged his shoulders i can try to run more
of the chutes but cordelling is safer

  calling in the cordell and cordell men lie rang the bell
for more speed swung the wheel and began nosing the

ckeyptme along thi downstream	of  huge bf
 

argosy

seemed to stretch from side to side completely across the
river

  between the yellow humps of mud and sand above the
surface only a few rippling stretches of turgid water showed
whfere the river was trying to cut its way through any one
of those turgid chutes might be the main channel-or a
deadly trap

  freed from the capstan and cordell garry kent stood
in thfr very bow watching ahead with narrowed eyes

  two chutes passed and then a third and with each
passing one garrys lips drew tighter

  then chastain slowed the engine off the fourth chute
brought the bow slowly around to head straight into it
the engine gong clanged as he rang for full speed ahead

  garry hit the pilot-house ladder on the run went up it
in great bounds he burst in through the pilot house door
nick kelso at his heels

  captain waters pierre chouteau and jeannie macleod
turned with startled glances chastians eyes flashed malev-
olently and his fingers tightened on the wheel

  garry fairly jerked the spokes out of his hands

  stop her he ordered stop her quick back the
engine

  captain waters looked dazed then angry why whats
the matter im captain here and chastain is the pilot
were the ones that give the orders

  then give em-and give em quick snapped garry
if you dont want to snag the bottom out of her in two
minutes	

captain waters still gaped but the girl with light-
ing speed jerked the bell-cord-jerked it again and
with a shudder of her reversed engine and paddles the
cheyenne ceased headway hung and began to move slowly
astern

  with a crackling oath the pilot tried to beat aside garrys
hands get out of here you aint no pilot

  and neither are you if you cant see a snag in the mid-
dle of the channel right under your nose retorted garry
he whirled on pierre chouteau theres a snag right
where hes heading that would rip the cheyenne like a
gutted buffalo

  snag youre a liar snarled chastain theres not a
snag in sight

  not a snag no-but a ripple you can see it from right
here look said garry pointing and there right in the
middle of the chute was a faint line on the surface as if a
feather had been dragged through it if you dont believe
me mr chouteau put the yawl over and take a look at it

  the pilot made a snatch for the bell cord but nick
kelso was quicker

  git away from that wheel an cord he emphasized

the order with the point of his hunting knife which he
had drawn and jabbed warningly against the pilots ribs
back up an keep backed up if yuh wanta enjoy yore next
vittles

  but it was pierre chouteau who settled the situation

  put in to the bank-and then get the yawl over ill
go in it myself

  when the yavl returned pierre chouteaus grim look
told the story hen before his tongue that ripple was
made by a cottonwood snag two feet thick with one end
buried in the mud and the other within two feet of th
surface

  it wasnt in sight maybe from the bow it was but
not up here with the sun slanting wrong retorted chastain
sulkily he looked at pierre chouteau i told you cordell-
ing was safer but you yourself ordered me to try to run
the bar

  then why didnt you pick one of the other chutes you
passed up on the way to this demanded garry put the
yawl over and sound them theyre all better than this
one

  with a shrug chastain stepped back from the wheel and
the bell-cord and turned to pierre chouteau if this-
this free trapper is to pilot the cheyenne i will go below
but i will not be responsible for anything that happens

  jeannie macleods eyes were sparkling but pierre
chouteau fumbled at his watch-chain no it was my
fault i ordered you to risk running the bar go back to
your wheel and we will go back to cordelling but here-
after we will keep a lookout posted in the bow as well as
up here

  chastains face lighted triumphantly captain waters
turned on garry and nick with asperity clear the pilot-
house no passengers allowed up here

  as they returned to the lower deck nick kelso was
swearing in crestfallen tones shore the damn half-canuck
seen that snag i could see the ripple myself from up
there

  but garry kents face was flushed and his pulse was
pounding she pulled the bell-cord he mumbled dazedly
she pulled the bell-cord

  huh said nick kelso

  i said-i said that chastain slipped up again he was
heading deliberately for that snag

  yeah an he foxed out of it as trickily as he foxed out
of it that other time retorted nick kelso hes in as
strong as ever-an weve showed our hand an aint no
better off

  worse-cause next time itll be us he tries to snag
an not the cheyenne its us or him now an he knows it
that scalp itch i got is gittin worse by the minute

they had the stop watch on he horse they
should have timed the rider who went much

faster

by dale clark

author of hollywood rib etc

horse of another collar

                       in this corner j edwin bell hollywoods lightweight
                       champion nickel-pincher in that corner the horse
                       with the soulful eyes fifteen rounds to a decision

  toliday in the third sneered j edwin bell

   i-i youre tellingme to bet my dough on that
- oat-burner which hasnt won a race since
hitler was a house painter

  not bet on the horse buy him corrected feedbox
phil swift its a once-in-a-lifetime proposition where
we not only cant lose but also are guaranteed to double
our money maybe ten times over

  he was a large red-faced individual clad in a techni-
colored sports coat vivid green trousers and a high-
yaller binocular-case slung on a shoulder-strap he
looked like a racetrack tout and in fact feedbox phils
profession was that of retailing little rainbow-colored
envelopes priced at one buck and alleged to contain the
name of a sure-thing winner

  the natural question arises why if feedbox knew
any sure-thing winners didnt he bet on them himself
that was just the trouble he did and as a result the

guy seldom made a noise like two nickels jingling together
as he walked	v

  so when feedbox said our money the reference ap-
plied exclusively to j edwin bells bankroll

  mr bell knew this for he had not been born yester-
day he was a lank slightly stooped citizen attired in
patent-leather footgear perfectly creased bond street
garments plus a monocle on a black silk cord he was
a sartorial symphony severely jarred by one sour note

  mr bells face supplied the sour note outthrust
from his scrawny neck his sharply beaked features were
those of a bird of prey

  or in other words he did not look like a character
who would be apt to toss his folding money around free
gratis or just for fun

  indeed not mr bell had invented the idea of frozen
assets long before the us government hit on its present
policy of international finance his assets were so badly




argosy

frozen that anybody would need a blow torch to thaw a
dime out of him

  and the idea of buying a race horse struck him as
being a lot less hot than the aforesaid blow torch

  utsnay jeered j edwin what would i do with
one of them bang-tailed nags i aint bing crosby or
louis b mayer or -scowling bitterly- gus len-
nox neither

  so saying he stepped briskly toward the racetrack
clubhouse

fphe scene before him lay brilliant with california sun-
shine and even more brilliant with movie glamour
the gemlike setting of the clubhouse enclosure twinkled
with producers and directors and stars not to mention
the phonies who were merely trying to look as if they
might be famous producers directors and stars

  for it was horse time in hollywood and the blue-
grass bug had bitten deeply into the veins of the cinema
colony picture people were reading the racing form in-
stead of variety and scanning the morning handicaps
even before they read their own press-agent notices in
the daily papers the line of celebrities at the pari-
mutuel windows resembled graumans chinese theater on
a world premiere night while the track rail had become
an autograph hunters paradise

   in short the racing craze was colossal

  even gus lennox the napoleonic little producer in
charge of mogul films had fallen victim to the blue-grass
bug

  only victim wasnt exactly the word for gus lennox
no sooner had he plunked down a million dollars or near-
ly for one of the biggest stables on the west coast than
he came up with a winner a big-money many-time win-
ner in fact

  it was getting so that virtually every time j edwin bell
picked up a sunday paper there was a headline about
gus lennoxs horse see whisker winning another ten- or
fifteen- or twenty-thousand dollar stake race and every
time mr bell read that kind of news he felt a large cold
sensation like a snowball inside his vest

  this was because j edwin didnt like lennox even
slightly lennox didnt like him either the feud was
open and furious and obviously feedbox phil was well
aware of the fact

  for he hastened to clutch j edwin bells exquisitely
tailored coatsleeve

  listen wait besides being a fortune in it youre
gonna jar gus lennox loose from his eyeteeth when see
whisker dont win that  movie handicap next
saturday

  startled sound slid over mr bells tongue see whisk-
er i thought you was telling me to buy a broken-down
bangtail named holiday

   feedbox stretched his lips into a confident grin

  yeah its one and the same thing

  its-huh what the-

  the technicolor tout chuckled im telling ya bell
see whisker is a champion and holiday cant hardly run
fast enough to stay in front of a mud turtle but still if
we buy holiday it means see whisker is bound to lose
that race

  hastily he explained ya see bell race horses is al-
most human only more so theyre high-strung they got
temperament theyre a lot of four-footed garbos and

they all got their own special pet companions most gen-
erally its the stable dog but sometimes they take a
fancy to a cat or even a pig and i remember one famous
case where a horse wouldnt be happy without his pet
rooster along

tytever slow on the uptake mr bells mentality sur-
- rounded the idea instailtly you mean them two
horses

  yeah theyre stablemates its a regular damon and
python act declared feedbox i got it straight from
a exercise boy that see whisker goes completely off his
feed when holiday aint with him he turns into such a
nervous wreck he cant possible win no races

  and feedbox phil laughed triumphantly only len-
nox dont know about it hes a strictly clubhouse owner
that dont never even set foot inside the stables so hes
gone and entered holiday in the third today-which
same is a claiming race for one thousand bucks

  j edwin bell did not know what a claiming race was

  feedbox explained the claiming race rule any horse
entered in such an event could be purchased by dropping
a bid in the stewards box as he explained the large man
produced a typewritten from his technicolored sports
garb

  i got the bid all writ out making us joint owners of
holiday so all you gotta do is sign a check for a thousand
bucks he concluded after which we bet a bale of
dough against see whisker on saturday the bookies is
bound to be loaded with bets on the favorite so theres
a cinch to be lots of lay-off coin looking for takers and
we take it see

  mr bell didnt see since he didnt even know what
lay-off money was mr bells gambling education had
been neglected owing to his lifelong habit of never risking
a cent on any racket except his own

  moreover he didnt care what lay-off money meant

  okay he grunted and reached a skinny hand for his
checkbook

  he gave feedbox phil the signed check but kept his
thoughts to himself and his thoughts were rapid ones
j edwin bell was a hollywood flesh peddler-a free-
lance cinema agent who wrangled studio jobs for his
clients and collected ten percent of their salaries

  in addition mr bell being very good at addition he
also collected anything else that wasnt either padlocked
or firmly nailed down -thus arose the hollywood rumor
that j edwin had very taking ways they claimed he
would take the gold fillings from a clients teeth and then
send the sucker a bill for dental services performed

  hence it may be guessed that mr bell felt no tempta-
tion to bet a bale of his dough on a herd of horses run-
ning around a circle to see which could get back first to
where they started from and much less was he tempted
to split his take with feedbox phil

  thinking like lightning the flesh peddlers brain zig--
zagged to a different idea of his own

  hot dog he exulted

  all he had to do was make a phone call and write out
another check   

chortly thereafter the flesh peddler inserted his lank
 length next to the rail and fixed his monocled stare on
the track the horses were going to the post for the third
race and a glance at the program had already informed
horse of another collar

si

him that holiday was number  in the procession likewise
a glance at the tote board disclosed that odds were -
against the lennox entry

  why became clear with the track announcers cry of
theyre off

  for number  came out of the starting gate with all the
alacrity of a sightseeing sunday motorist as the pack
swept past the grandstand holiday was eating dust ten
lengths behind the others but not for long

  because rounding into the backstretch the dust had
already settled before he caught up with it

  in fact if the jockey had been in any real hurry
to go somewhere he would have done well to jump off
and get going on his own two feet

  proving feedbox was right reflected mr bell con-
tentedly that hay-hauler couldnt make twenty miles
per hour downhill with a high wind behind him so it
must be on account of see whisker he wasnt optioned
out on a rag cart long ago

  thus encouraged the flesh broker betook his elegantly
tailored self toward the track stewards office feedbox
phil had the same impulse so the pair poured through
the doorway in a photo finish

  the track steward a functionary named cabsley
greeted them with a puzzled frown and the remark that
there seemed to be some misunderstanding you gentle-
mn are claiming the same horse twice you have-er
submitted two bids and two checks for one thousand
dollars

  cabsley couldnt figure it out indeed he couldnt fig-
ure out why anybody would want to claim holiday even
once

  feedbox phil was also in the dark-in the midst of

dark misgivings

  bell he blurted you aint by any chance giving
me the doublecross or are you

  j edwin was although not by mere chance

  listen cabsley said the flesh peddler theys only
one bid that counts them checks is numbered and by
calling up the bank you can find i already stopped pay-
ment on the first one which leaves me the sole un-
divided owner of holiday

  why you two-faced buzzard twanged feedbox
phil

  baloney scoffed mr bell you didnt put in noth-
ing but your idea and i trun that out because i got a
better one of my own  

feedbox phil exited but not before voicing loud
opinions concerning j edwin bells ancestry moral
character and probable address in a future existence

  the flesh peddler shrugged as the door slammed for
the squawk of the sucker was as ever music in his ears
and besides feedboxs indignation proved that the deal
was really a very good thing

  imagine he chuckled that technicolor tout trying
to be partners with me

  cabsley shook his head im afraid mr swift couldnt
have complied with the-ah other formality you see
in order to claim a horse you have to be a member in
good standing of the racing owners association

  mr bells chuckle strangled in his scrawny throat
yeah whats the bite for that he barked

  five hundred dollars per season mr bell and it
entitles you to cast a ballot at our annual election of

officers too cabsley spoke with impressive emphasis

  five cs for one vote griped the screen agent why
i could buy a whole precinct in a presidential election
for that

  doubtless shrugged the steward but racing is the
sport of kings not presidents and its costs accordingly
ha-ha

  feeling like a king who was being forced to sign his
abdication proclamation j edwin unhinged his check-
book

oh er while youre about it continued cabsley
of course the horse will remain in the custody of the

track management until your-ah checks have gone

through the bank in the morning so there will be the
additional nominal daily stable fee of fifteen dollars
mr bell yelped protest like the wail of an air-raid

  fifteen fish for one dayl listen all you gotta do is
tie the nag up in a barn and throw him a armful of
straw he dont need no private room and bath at the
ambassador hotel with his meals served to him in bed
the steward shrugged a horse like holiday doesnt
live on straw my dear fellow he must be fed a
special vitamized mash diet he requires the services
of an exercise boy and a trainer to rub him down after
his daily workout you must realize youre acquired a
thoroughbred racing animal-

the flesh peddler emerged into the california sun-
shine with mingled feelings in the first place he
felt like a guy who has just taken a fall out of his finances
by writing checks totaling fifteen hundred and fifteen
bucks

  but in the second place he also felt like a guy who
is going to cash a check for ten grand

moreover it would be a check autographed by mr bells

oldest enemy

  meaning mused mr bell by tomorrow morning
lennox is gonna be on his knees in my office begging
me to take a mere one thousand percent profit
tomorrow morning arrived on schedule but gus len-
nox didnt instead j edwins office slavey entered the
inner office to announce that a miss day wanted to see
him

  she says its about a horse continued the slavey
and she wouldnt listen when i tried to tell her the
nearest bookie is in the cigar store around the corner
for mr bells office help was never very bright owing
to the fact that nobody with brains would hire out at the
flesh brokers prevailing or chinese coolie wage scale

  a dame huh must be lennoxs private secretary
muttered j edwin bell okay send her in

  miss day came in and it may be mentioned that she
was indeed a very select ensemble of femininity

  although wearing riding pants and an old sweater the
girl clearly had the figure of an aquabelle moreover
her hair resembled strained honey her lips were ruby
and she possessed eyes of songwriters blue

mr bell cried this vision breathlessly im miss
holly day and my dad trains mr lennoxs horses and
yesterday was all a mistake so heres your moneyback 
and she spread ten crisp one-hundred-dollar government
engravings on the flesh peddlers desk

you see mr bell holiday isnt really a race horse
any more he was crowded into the rail at del mar two

frozen that anybody would need a blow torch to thaw a
dime out of him

  and the idea of buying a race horse struck him as
being a lot less hot than the aforesaid blow torch

  utsnay jeered j edwin what would i do with
one of them bang-tailed nags i aint bing crosby or
louis b mayer or -scowling bitterly- gus len-
nox neither

  so saying he stepped briskly toward the racetrack
clubhouse

the scene before him lay brilliant with california sun-
shine and even more brilliant with movie glamour
the gemlike setting of the clubhouse enclosure twinkled
with producers and directors and stars not to mention
the phonies who were merely trying to look as if they
might be famous producers directors and stars

  for it was horse time in hollywood and the blue-
grass bug had bitten deeply into the veins of the cinema
colony picture people were reading the racing form in-
stead of variety and scanning the morning handicaps
even before they read their own press-agent notices in
the daily papers the line of celebrities at the pari-
mutuel windows resembled graumans chinese theater on
a world premiere night while the track rail had become
an autograph hunters paradise

  in short the racing craze was colossal

  even gus lennox the napoleonic little producer in
charge of mogul films had fallen victim to the blue-grass
bug

  only victim wasnt exactly the word for gus lennox
no sooner had he plunked down a million dollars or near-
ly for one of the biggest stables on the west coast than
he came up with a winner a big-money many-time win-
ner in fact

  it was getting so that virtually every time j edwin bell
picked up a sunday paper there was a headline about
gus lennoxs horse see whisker winning another ten- or
fifteen- or twenty-thousand dollar stake race and every
time mr bell read that kind of news he felt a large cold
sensation like a snowball inside his vest

  this was because j edwin didnt like lennox even
slightly lennox didnt like him either the feud was
open and furious and obviously feedbox phil was well
aware of the fact

  for he hastened to clutch j edwin bells exquisitely
tailored coatsleeve

  listen wait besides being a fortune in it youre
gonna jar gus lennox loose from his eyeteeth when see
whisker dont win that  movie handicap next
saturday

  startled sound slid over mr bells tongue see whisk-
er i thought you was telling me to buy a broken-down
bangtail named holiday

  feedbox stretched his lips into a confident grin

  yeah its one and the same thing

  its-huh what the-

  the technicolor tout chuckled im telling ya bell
see whisker is a champion and holiday cant hardly run
fast enough to stay in front of a mud turtle but still if
we buy holiday it means see whisker is bound to lose
that race

  hastily he explained ya see bell race horses is al-
most human only more so theyre high-strung they got
temperament theyre a lot of four-footed garbos and

they all got their own special pet companions most gen-
erally its the stable dog but sometimes they take a
fancy to a cat or even a pig and i remember one famous
case where a horse wouldnt be happy without his pet
rooster along

tvtever slow on the uptake mr bells mentality sur-
rounded the idea instantly you mean them two
horses

  yeah theyre stablemates its a regular damon and
python act declared feedbox i got it straight from 
a exercise boy that see whisker goes completely off his
feed when holiday aint with him he turns into such a
nervous wreck he cant possible win no races

  and feedbox phil laughed triumphantly only len-
nox dont know about it hes a strictly clubhouse owner
that dont never even set foot inside the stables so hes
gone and entered holiday in the third today-which
same is a claiming race for one thousand bucks

  j edwin bell did not know what a claiming race was

  feedbox explained the claiming race rule any horse
entered in such an event could be purchased by dropping
a bid in the stewards box as he explained the large man
produced a typewritten from his technicolored sports
garb

  i got the bid all writ out making us joint owners of
holiday so all you gotta do is sign a check for a thousand
bucks he concluded after which we bet a bale of
dough against see whisker on saturday the bookies is
bound to be loaded with bets on the favorite so theres
a cinch to be lots of lay-off coin looking for takers and
we take it see

  mr bell didnt see since he didnt even know what
lay-off money was mr bells gambling education had
been neglected owing to his lifelong habit of never risking
a cent on any racket except his own

  moreover he didnt care what lay-off money meant

  okay he grunted and reached a skinny hand for his
checkbook

  he gave feedbox phil the signed check but kept his
thoughts to himself and his thoughts were rapid ones
j edwin bell was a hollywood flesh peddler-a free-
lance cinema agent who wrangled studio jobs for his
clients and collected ten percent of their salaries

  in addition mr bell being very good at addition he
also collected anything else that wasnt either padlocked
or firmly nailed down thus arose the hollywood rumor
that j edwin had very taking ways they claimed he
would take the gold fillings from a clients teeth and then
send the sucker a bill for dental services performed

  hence it may be guessed that mr bell felt no tempta-
tion to bet a bale of his dough on a herd - of horses run-
ning around a circle to see which could get back first to
where they started from and much less was he tempted
to split his take with feedbox phil

  thinking like lightning the flesh peddlers brain zig-
zagged to a different idea of his own

  hot dog he exulted

  all he had to do was make a phone call and write out
another check   

chortly thereafter the flesh peddler inserted his lank
 length next to the rail and fixed his monocled stare on
the track the horses were going to the post for the third
race and a glance at the program had already informed
horse of another collar

sx

him that holiday was number  in the procession likewise
a glance at the tote board disclosed that odds were -
against the lennox entry

 why became clear with the track announcers cry of
 theyre off

 for number  came out of the starting gate with all the
 alacrity of a sightseeing sunday motorist as the pack
 swept past the grandstand holiday was eating dust ten
 lengths behind the others but not for long

 because rounding into the backstretch the dust had
 already settled before he caught up with it

 in fact if the jockey had been in any real hurry
 to go somewhere he would have done well to jump off
 and get going on his own two feet

 proving feedbox was right reflected mr bell con-
 tentedly that hay-hauler couldnt make twenty miles
 per hour downhill with a high wind behind him so it
 must be on account of see whisker he wasnt optioned
 out on a rag cart long ago

 thus encouraged the flesh broker betook his elegantly
 tailored self toward the track stewards office feedbox
 phil had the same impulse so the pair poured through
 the doorway in a photo finish

 the track steward a functionary named cabsley
 greeted them with a puzzled frown and the remark that
 there seemed to be some misunderstanding you gentle-
 mn are claiming the same horse twice you have-er
 submitted two bids and two checks for one thousand
 dollars

 cabsley couldnt figure it out indeed he couldnt fig-
 ure out why anybody would want to claim holiday even

 once

 feedbox phil was also in the dark-in the midst of

 dark misgivings

 bell he blurted you aint by any chance giving
 me the doublecross or are you

 j edwin was although not by mere chance

 listen cabsley said the flesh peddler theys only
 one bid that counts them checks is numbered and by
 calling up the bank you can find i already stopped pay-
 ment on the first one which leaves me the sole un-
 divided owner of holiday

 why you two-faced buzzard twanged feedbox
 phil

 baloney scoffed mr bell you didnt put in noth-
 ing but your idea and i trun that out because i got a
 better one of my own  

 feedbox phil exited but not before voicing loud
 opinions concerning j edwin bells ancestry moral
 character and probable address in a future existence

 the flesh peddler shrugged as the door slammed for
 the squawk of the sucker was as ever music in his ears
 and besides feedboxs indignation proved that the deal
 was really a very good thing

 imagine he chuckled that technicolor tout trying
 to be partners with me

 cabsley shook his head im afraid mr swift couldnt
 have complied with the-ah other formality you see
 in order to claim a horse you have to be a member in
 good standing of the racing owners association

 mr bells chuckle strangled in his scrawny throat
 yeah whats the bite for that he barked

 five hundred dollars per season mr bell and it
 entitles you to cast a ballot at our annual election of

officers too cabsley spoke with impressive emphasis

  five cs for one vote griped the screen agent why
i could buy a whole precinct in a presidential election
for that

  doubtless shrugged the steward but racing is the
sport of kings not presidents and its costs accordingly
ha-ha

  feeling like a king who was being forced to sign his
abdication proclamation j edwin unhinged his check-
book

oh er while youre about it continued cabsley
of course the horse will remain in the custody of the

track management until your-ah checks have gone

through the bank in the morning so there will be the
additional nominal daily stable fee of fifteen dollars
mr bell yelped protest like the wail of an air-raid
siren

  fifteen fish for one day listen all you gotta do is
tie the nag up in a barn and throw him a armful of
straw he dont need no private room and bath at the
ambassador hotel with his meals served to him in bed
the steward shrugged a horse like holiday doesnt

years ago and he broke his shoulder and he cant run a
tiny bit fast since then

  j edwin bell curved his lips into a thin grin oh
yeah then what makes you so anxious to give my
dough back

  because he was always my favorite from the time he
was a colt the girl sighed and when he broke his
shoulder-well i made a pet of him thats why

  mr bells grin became an audible laugh like pebbles
revolving in a concrete mixer

  please the blonde implored her slim tanned hands
trembled as she pushed the bank notes toward the flesh
peddler holiday shouldnt have run in that race yester-
day and he wouldnt have-only dad and i were both
out at the stock farm thats the truth and youre really

very lucky to get this money back

  j edwin shook his head cut out the sob-sister act
he gibed it aint gonna get you no bargain basement rates
from me my price is ten grand-plus fifteen hundred and
fifteen bucks expenses

  ten thou  eleven thousand dollars choked miss
holly day unbelievingly mr bell please dont joke

about itif youd seen how sad he was in that

strange stable last night-how he picked up his ears and
whinnied when i went to him this morning-gee it just
brought tears to my eyes

  it didnt bring a tear to the flesh peddlers monocled
orb on the contrary his predatory visage was more than
ever that of a hungry vulture

  to show you how much im joking he retorted
you can tell gux lennox the price is gonna be fifteen
grand plus expenses if he waits another day 

  the girl stared mr lennox but mr lennox doesnt
even know-

  utsnay mr bells skinny hand practically didnt
even linger as he thrust the hundred-dollar bills away
from him take this chicken feed away from here and
tell gus what i said  

  his tone left no room for argument blindly miss da
pushed the rejected wealth into her riding pants pocket
and stumbled from the office

  j edwin bell helped himself to a cigar and a pleasur-
able pipe dream both of which were only half finished
when the underpaid office girl again entered his sanc-
tum

  this time she related pits two men who want to
see you about a horse

  mr bell wasnt surprised-yet hed figured it would-
nt be long before gux lennox sent emissaries bearing a
higher offer

  send em in

  immediately after whiph j edwin was surprised

because the two guys who wanted to see him about
a horse consisted of feedbox phil swift followed by
another individual who looked like he was probably a
direct descendent of dracula

  as a cinema agent mr bell naturally had a lot of
experience in classifying human types so it was easy
for him to index the newcomer as belonging to the
government guest or alcatraz classification 

bell meet torpedo tommy feedbox greeted him
grimly on accouht of you giving me the well-known
freeze i hadda get a new partner-and torpedo is it
pleased to meetcha chum remarked torpedo tom-

my from the southwest side of his swarthy ugly face

   j edwin bell wasnt pleased he had a severe super-
 stition about having his path crossed by dark-complected
 guys-especially when the dark-featured one used the
 corner of his mouth for carrying on conversation and
 obviously used his coat pocket for carrying heavy hard-
 ware

   ya see bell remarked feedbox phil torpedo is
 going in with me and investing his total finances in tak-
 ing up them bookie lay-off bets look here

   mr bell looked at the large bundle of banknotes
 which appeared in feedboxs hand

   on account of how torpedo is kind of avoiding society
 until he cools off explained the tout hes letting me
 handle the cash which im showing you sos you under-
 derstand hed be very annoyed if see whisker wins that
 race after all

   j edwin gulped

   and when torpedo gets annoyed stated feedbox
 he is apt to go around letting daylight through people
 he lets it through them in large round chunks too such
 as is caused by a  slug you wouldnt want that to
 happen to you huh

   mr bell glanced apprehensively at the easily annoyed
 torpedo that individual was peering interestedly at
 the large number of movie stars photos which adorned
 the screen agents wall

   this struck j edwin as much more frightening than
 as if the guy had tried to act tough g-great s-slither-
 ing s-snakes no slid from the flesh brokers pallid
 lips

   then intoned feedbox coldly you better not try
 any tricks like selling holiday back to gus lennox be-
 fore the big race

   why struggled mr bell i never had any such
 idea never even daydreamed of it

   even as he spoke however the phone rang mr bell
 surrounded the instrument with chilly clutching fingers
 h-hello he quavered

 rphe voice was familiar and feminine i did as you
 told me and telephoned mr lennox came miss
 holly days soprano accents hes on his way to the
 track now and he wants to see you there immediately
 the flesh peddler started the eye behind his monocle
 flashed a hectic mazda gleam induced by rapidly alter-
 nating currents of high-voltage - triumph and despair
 galvanic tremors shuddered through his well-tailored
 i form

   his scheme had worked he was all set to nick gus
 lennox for plenty

   but if he did he was liable to get himself perforated
 by torpedo tommys hardware

   it looked like a short-circuit it looked in fact as if
 mr bell had been too smart for himself when he handed
 feedbox phil the run-around for a heart-sickened in-
 stant he regretted that episode of the stopped-payment
 check   

   but for only a moment because right away his agile
 wits whirled to the obvious solution what if his wires
 had got crossed all he had to do was get busy and
 double cross them

   okay he cried into the phone ill send somebody
 right over there

   but protested the girls voice mr lennox doesnt
horse of another collar



want somebody he asked you to come-personally
  yeah ill take care of it-personally

  replacing the phone in its cradle j edwin bell beamed
brightly toward torpedo tommy

  you got me all wrong he asserted virtuously i
aint merely just on the level but i can prove it that
call was from ketrell moguls casting director offering
a screen test which im gonna give you first crack at
for the flesh peddler had not failed to note the fas-
cinated interest with which torpedo regarded the film
fan photography on the wall

  me goggled torpedo tommy ya mean to be a
moom pitcher star

  why not asked mr bell who had not yet met any-
one who didnt want to become one

  well hesitated torpedo i never acted none
you wont have to reassured j edwin its a test
for a gangster pix so all you gotta do is to be natch-
eral

  and he thrust a scribbled address across the desk
here you are tommy be sure and see mr ketrell
himself and make him understand youve had plenty of
real-life tough-guy experiences because what they want
in the flickers nowadays aint acting its realism

  the real-life tough guy muttered dazedly me in the
moom pitchers oh boy i hope they let me act with ann
sheridan

  mr bell coughed they will tommy ill fix it up
for you so they do

  oh boy

  torpedo shot out of there leaving feedbox staring hard
at the flesh peddler that wasnt so smart bell he
voiced dangerously ann sheridan dont act in any mogul
pictures and torpedo aint liable to neither hes apt
to be annoyed at you when he finds them things out you
phoney

  chuckling mysteriously the flesh peddler moved to
the office window and watched torpedo tommy bolt into a
cab in the street below whereupon his chuckle became a
large loud horselaugh

  you ought to read all the papers feedbox instead
of merely the handicappers columns advised j edwin
so youd know there has been a terrific scandal in holly-
wood about hoodlums crashing in as movie extras its
being investigated by the fbi-and ketrell is the
g-guy on the mogul lot something tells me hes gonna
sign torpedo up on a long term contract such as twenty
years to life

  and mr bell clapped on his derby and issued into the
street feeling like two boy scouts who had both done
their good deeds for the day

  taxi he caroled merrily hollydale race track-

the clubhouse enclosure into which the taxicab
rolled was brilliant with the same brand of cali-
fornia sunshine as yesterday although at this a m hour
the scene lacked the glitter of hollywood glamour

  the only hollywood personality in sight was gus len-
nox leaning against the track rail and gus lennox didnt
glitter he glowered-at the stop-watch  in his hand

  miss holly day had also arrived and she didnt look
very happy either indeed her blue eyes were tragically
fixed no the paddock where an exercise boy slowly walked
a race horse up and down

  obviously the thoroughbred had been put through

  his paces for lennoxs benefit and was now being cooled
off for the sunshine glinted on the crystal of a stop-
watch in the girls slender fingers and finally the big
gray-haired man beside her similarly grasped a dockers
timepiece

  the build-up failed to impress j edwin bell utsnay
he jeered as he climbed out of the cab you know it dont
make any difference how fast that nag cant go from here
to somewhere else ha-ha

  gus lennox whirled at the sound of the bell

  so you crooker- growled the mogul producer
your price begins from ten thousand bucks on up
plus expenses stated mr bell firmly

 the two old enemies eyed each other like gladiators
about to launch the death thrust

  gus lennox appeared over-matched for the pro-
ducer weighed in at less poundage than a racing jockey
besides being as bald and brown and shriveled as a
weatherworn peanut

  however mr lennox had not become the big boss of
mogul films by being kicked around until he accidentally
came out on top nor had he acquired a super-surtax
income by letting loose of ten thousand lettuce every
time some hollywood chiseler tried to make green salad
of his bankroll

  now he fired the first salvo well bell it gives me
pleasure to tell you personal-so i can see your face
when you hear the news which is i aint paying you
ten grand or even ten cents because this holiday is
such a slow skate i wouldnt take him back even for
a free gift horse

  j edwin bell wasnt fooled he wasnt fooling either
grim threatening sound percolated upward from his
tonsils

  oh yeah he jeered then you aint gonna win
any  movie picture handicap on saturday
gus lennox blinked bewilderment

  bell youre crazy i should enter holiday in the
handicap-in a big colossal a-grade production which
my see whisker is the leading star of

the fljesh peddler sniffed i guess you aint heard

	gus it so happens your class a horse and my class b
oat-burner is strictly a double-feature attraction-and
you come in at the middle because them two nags is
pals if you let holiday go its gonna bust see whisk-
ers heart hell go off his feed and not even sleep nights
meaning he couldnt win that handicap even if all the
other horses in it hadda run backwards

  gus lennox recoiled his pinched features lost their
peanut brown and assumed a faded flop-house blanket
pallor he pivoted drunkenly toward the big gray-haired
man

  day he howled youre my horse trainer why
dont you tell me these things

  before the gray-haired man could tell him anything
the girl interfered

  nonsense she declared far from being pals those
two horses are actually so jealous of each other that theyd
fight at the drop of a halter 

  j edwin shrugged baloney shes trying to double-
cross you and buy the horse herself i got it practically
straight from your exercise boy that see whisker aint
worth his salt without hcfliday being on hand to keep him
company and encourage him


argosy

  sudden laughter came from the grey-haired trainer so
thats it good lord mr lennox this is funny the
exercise boy wasnt talking about holiday-he meant my
daughter holly day 

  j edwin bell experienced a quick foreboding like a
neutral nations living next door to a dictator miss holly
day-and holliday-added up in his mind and the an-
swer was a total financial zero

  the gray-haired mans voice went on you see mr
lennox my daughter practically raised both of those
horses from tiny colts holiday was always her favorite
and so we named him after her but shes had a lot to
do with training see whisker too horses apparently just
take to certain people thats why one jockey can be suc-
cessful with an animal that no other jock can even get into
the money with so that explains-

  mr bell knew what it explained he really didnt need
to listen to the rest at all the exercise boy had really
meant that see whisker didnt do so well when miss holly
day wasnt around to help train him

j edwins eye was a wide circle of dismay behind

	its monocle cold shivers played tag around the in-
terior of his bond street costume his cash-register brain
gears whirred and ground out jangling speech

  suffering serpents and i paid fifteen hundred and
fifteen bucks for a horse which would have to borrow a
bicycle to even beat a traffic light

  miss holly day reached into her riding pants pocket
to produce crisp banknotes and a bill of sale

  this is my own money mr bell she said and my
offer still stands

  the flesh peddler hesitated

  but only for a moment because believe it or not he
already had another idea maybe holiday wasnt any
bargain in horseflesh but at least one guy in the world
firmly believed otherwise

  feedbox phil and feedbox had that bankroll of
torpedo tommys feedbox could-and would-be glad
to buy holiday so as to protect his lay-off bets

  mr bell figured this out fast and he also figured he
couldnt possibly lose he could always fall back on the
girls standing offer couldnt he

  j edwin thought he could and therefore he swung
around to the cab driver

  jehu he barked how much to drive back slow
sos i can lead the nag behind us

  for the flesh peddlers financial plans did not include
any more fifteen-dollar-per-day accommodations in holi-
days future

  the cabby ruminated le see now a horse walks
about five miles a hour figgering my time should be
worth two-fifty per hour for me and my heap that
makes-

  that makes too much snarled the flesh broker
he waggled his skinny hand at the exercise boy cmon
over here and get off that bang-tail

  miss day gasped you mean-

  yeah im gonna save cab fare

  for mr bells instincts as previously noted were of
a glue-like consistency in financial matters

  thus commanded the exercise youth cantered his steed
into the enclosure he got out of the saddle and mr
bell got into it although mr bell did not look much
like gene autry in the process to be sure

  for j edwins method of arriving aboard a horse
was that of first climbing on top of the nearest fence
and then sort of shinnying up the rest of the way

  shinnying he did get into the saddle-and facing the
same way the horse was too

  so far so good for the rest his position rather missed
the orthodox style in horsemanship the flesh-peddlers
legs were somewhat longer than the exercise boys of
course indeed they were a lot longer

  so when mr bell inserted his patent-leather footgear
into the stirrups his knees angled up to where he was
liable to knock his chin on them this unusual stance
naturally left no room for his elbows except by sticking
them straight out

  all in all his appearance on the postage-stamp saddle
was about as graceful as that of an medieval victim in a
torture chair

  that was just how he looked

  how he felt was worse because it included the sen-
sation of being much higher in the air than he had ex-
pected

  the cabby stung by the loss of his fare chortled a
vengeful

 giddapl 

  mr bell had no intention of giddapping he preferred
to sit still awhile and gradually get used to his new sur-
roundings

  but the cabby wasnt talking to j edwin he had
addressed his remark to holiday and the horse obeyed
moreover he did not dally around by starting at a
walk he began by doing his best right away-and while
holidays best was not good enough to win any races
still it was plenty fast enough for the flesh peddler

  whoa wailed the agent jerking both hands on the
reins as hard as he could

  it turned out though that mr bell had both hands
wrapped around just one rein

ttoliday wheeled on a dime and gave a nickel in
change but j edwin bell took in a lot more
territory than that his orbit included about twenty
yards of the clubhouse enclosure after which the flesh
broker staggered to his feet in a state of extensive sar-
torial disrepair

  in fact he was practically all disrepaired large divots
of cloth flapped loosely from his nude knees his coat was
split up the back and his derby looked like it had been
kicked around by two rose bowl teams

  miss days choked voice assailed his eardrums you
fool you made holiday f-fall and b-break his neck

  j edwin bell peered through the cracked glass of his
monocle and saw the motionless body of the thoroughbred
the sight turned his blood to red ink because even
he wasnt financial wizard enough to sell a dead horse
to feedbox phil

  he cant be dead i fell farther than he did and
im still alive gulped the flesh broker get up holi-
day

  he caughf up the reins jerked them

  hes d-dead all right or hed m-move the girl
sobbed mr bell ill give you a hundred dollars for hirn
the w-way he is its w-worth it to see the poor thing
gets a d-decent b-burial

  gimmie muttered j edwin in abject surrender

  but youll have to s-sign the b-bill of s-sale i dont
horse of another collar



t-trust y-you not to t-take my m-money and then sell
him to a g-glue factory miss pay asserted tremulously

  mr bell signed it and counted his hundred dollar bill
one and a half times-not twice because before he got
that far the girl had snapped her fingers

  holy shivering snakes gusted the flesh peddler
twin fires of dismay kindled in his sallow cheeks the
thoroughbred had come to life and to his feet too  
its a gag

  a trick nodded the girl i told you he was my
pet mr bell he knows lots of other tricks besides
playing dead and he does them all by hand signals
assorted language came to j edwins lips and then
he had to think up an entirely fresh supply of adjec-
tives he had to for he heard another voice

  that horse is worth anyway two thousand dollars
gus lennox was commenting

  no holly day shook her head firmly im sorry
but i couldnt bear to sell him to anyone now that hes
really and truly mine

  the mogul producer laughed i mean two thousand a
week salary he corrected its an idea like practically
i always i get one from bells shennigans he mentions
about double features and then right away shows me a

trick horse that can be a great animal star like foi in-
stance rin-tin-tin used to be

  mr bell shuddered the dame was going to collect
two thousand bucks a week gus lennox had himself a
box-office draw and what did j edwin get for authoring
all this good fortune a fourteen hundred and fifteen
dollar loss was all

  or was it all

  it seemed there was more and worse for now a second
taxicab braked at the clubhouse entrance torpedo tom-
my leaped out of the machine looking exclusively annoyed
about something or other

  wait a minute he growled to his cabbie i gotta go
see that buzzard-faced guy on account of i lost the address
he wrote down for me to go and get screen-tested

  but mr bell did not overhear this remark he had
leaped over the fence and into high gear the recently
rolled racing oval looked highly suitable for running pur-
poses so j edwin bell aimed a course straight down the
homestretch

  why gasped miss holly day staring first at the
flesh brokers retreating form and then at her stopwatch
why hes going much faster than the official track
record

 but we still speak english

tts been some time now since weve run into that gag about the man whos busy reading the works by

	shakespeare but there seems to be a growing apprehension in this country that the gag is better known than
the poet or in other words that americans are losing touch with their literary background and wouldnt know
a classical allusion when they saw it at two paces in clear weather

   take for example the complaint of amy loveman in the saturday review of literature a writer used to
take it for granted that any old reference he threw into his stuff would click with the readers and save him time
one reference to the prodigal son or forty pieces of silver or a peak in darien one mention of caliban one mere
phrase such as not that i love caesar less- and the reader was right in line with what was going on no more
hardly anybody so goes the complaint now reads the bible or keats or shakespeare or any of the other great
works that have shucked out quotations for generations of americans

   it may be so we remember an excellent but somewhat testy laboratory instructor back at college who once
reprimanded a chortling student with the quotation the loud laugh that speaks the vacant mind goldsmith
you know the deserted village which she attributed to shakespeare student couldnt argue her out of it
either but at least she knew the quotation even though she didnt quite grasp its meaning

then there was the english class in the same college and the day when it tackled bacon essay on truth
what is truth said jesting pilate and would not stay for an answer the professor read that and
beamed on his class and asked with casual confidence who jesting pilate was exactly one student remembered
his bible well enough to give a correct answer-or any answer

   maybe something ought to be done about this but we dont know quite what there are those who hold out
hope for a reawakening interest in the classics via radio and the movies children nowadays will tell you without
hesitation that thomas a edison was mickey rooney and spencer tracy that don ameche invented the tele-
phone and paul muni licked the problem of hydrophobia

   but what to do about the people who wont listen to the radio or go to the movies we just walked all over
an assistant here who cut the expression i should of stood in bed out of a story because hed never heard of
it and it didnt make sense to him the fact that he memorized the quality of mercy speech shakespeare the
merchant of venice in grade school and still remembers most of it is no excuse on the contrary

still and all we arent too worried and wont be as long as people are reading argosy why our writers
use classical references all the time-ancient modern and contemporary remember that story mr emer-
son please copy and how it explained the origin of the philosophers famous crack about consistency sure 
and take right in this issue page -the story entitled and a hickory tree allusion there all right but
dont ask us where it came from not now anyway

   as for history and tradition both american and english our readers lap it up in the stories of argosy au-
thors like ted roscoe phil ketchum roy horn and bob carse its good stuff founded on careful research
while we keep printing things like that american readers arent going to lose sight of their background

   and were going to keep right on printing things like that

                                                                                    -the editors

 murder goes to seo

 by allan r bosworth

lyhe killer is there among them as the uss consola-
- tion-hospital ship of the pacific fleet-stands out
to sea on her fantastic double errand to rescue sailors
from a pig-boat coffin and to be a courtroom for crime

   lieutenant mcquaid engineering officer of the sub-
marine starfish has been murdered-his head crushed
by a blunt instrument-in the sick officers quarters of
the naval hospital on the california coast

   the crime followed the mysterious sinking of the star-
fish on a trial run with the loss of twenty-two men in
the flooded after compartment besides mcquaid those
saved on the first trip of the rescue ship algonquins
diving bell were

   lieutenant everett brill ii the submarines com-
mander whom mcquaid had accused of being drunk
after an altercation on the boat

   mike way chief torpedoman and master diver who
found a bottle on the skipper and hid it in the boat be-
cause it smelled of alcohol

   carnoni machinists mate who had threatened mc-
quaid because cardonis brother was in the doomed
after compartment when the lieutenant shut the door
against the inrushing water

   kowalski another sailor and john thorpe the jit-
tery youngster of the crew

   the two civilian observers for westco iron works
builder of the starfish victor melhorne chief engi-
neer and foster bedell naval architect

all of these men were in soq when mcquaid was
murdered but there were others there that night

several other people who were close to the crime

  gruff old admiral j k wetherbee retired laid up
with a broken leg whose carefully kept journal is to
throw interesting light on what happened

evelyn brill the submarine commanders daughter
who is following the family career as a navy nurse

  martin west submarine builder who is worried more
about his government contract for more boats than
about the men left in the starfish

  barbara his cafe-society daughter

  news of the murder having leaked out through west
the entire group-civilians and navy people alike-are
ordered aboard the hospital ship consolation where
they are in charge of young dr vincent ayres naval
surgeon who is in love with evelyn brill

oo	far the doctors investigation has brought out a
 number of important facts presumable murder
weapon is a broken billiard cue taken by the night
watchman from young john thorpe who cant explain
how he got it

 but a nurses cape blood-stained and rain-soaked
was found on the balcony outside the murdered mans
room and that cape by her own admission belongs to
evelyn brill

  barbara west confesses later that she saw the cape
and picked it up to shield her against the rain after she
had visited melhornes room in explaining her presence
there she reveals that she is engaged to melhorne

  lieutenant brill meanwhile has been ordered arrested
and held in his cabin on the consolation though head-
quarters has not specified the charges

  brill tells dr ayres that the bottle mike way took
from him contained not liquor but elixir terpin hydrate
which he was taking for his cough

  and that bottle is in the sunken submarine where
way hid it

this story began in the argosy for march 
murder goes to sea



chapter xi

-will strike again

evelyn brill left her fathers room with a des-
perate hopelessness gripping the pit of her stomach
lieutenant brills mental attitude was infectious
it showed in every line of his weathered face and in the
beaten slump of his shoulders

  that other time-after the collision when he was execu-
tive officer in the bolton-he was still a fighter and his
determination to win against the charges evelyn thought
had been mainly responsible for his winning

  she knew that everett brill fighting to keep bright a
name that had been on navy rolls for a long time this one
was a strangar

  twenty-five men remained entombed alive on the seas
bottom and their skipper had left his courage with them
in the cold stinking torpedo room

  with every hour he had grown more certain that his
arrest had nothing to do with the murder they were hold-
ing him responsible he said for the loss of his ship for
her loss and the deaths of the men in the after compart-
ment

  nothing could cheer him evelyn forced a parting smile
kissed the tip of his ear and went topside on her way to
the nurses quarters a girl couldnt be navy always some-
times you had to cry

  she saw big mike way leaning on the rail yonder
watching the algonquin in the fading twilight and bar-
bara west came out on deck wearing a dark fur-trimmed
frock smart enough for evening and leaving that subtle
perfume in her wake

  she didnt see evelyn but went toward the rail where
the chief torpedoman stood she walked with a slinky gait
predatory the girl who had to wear plain white drill told
herself-and went to her room hating barbara at the
moment

  nurse mae kennedy was at evelyns door she was
plump and something about her inspired delirious sailors
to clasp her hand and mutter mother  and just now she
looked as miserable as evelyn felt

  im-im going to be very ill she moaned before
i die i want to tell you-the admiral-wants to see you

  she lurched for her room across the passageway as the
consolation rolled right away she gasped and van-
ished inside

  evelyn smiled despite herself at leastshe had been
spared seasickness she gathered up the notes she had
taken on the temperature charts and went to the admirals
room

tte called come in and a corpsman left the room
with his supper tray it contained evelyn noted the
inevitable turkey leg bone admiral wetherbee waved to
s chair

  finally put me where i belong he boomed should
have been at sea all the time need a turn or two around
deck though the doctor told me i might be transferred
to the mechanized forces tomorrow

  mechanized forces evelyn said

  wheelchair brigade he chuckled then soberly
hows your father

  evelyn told him and there was a strange glint under
his shaggy brows

  just like the navy keeps a man on pins and needles
never telling him what his next tour of duty will be till
the last minute then its something he doesnt want

  i almost hate it evelyn said in a cold flat tone if
dad gets-beached ill resign ill take up nursing on the
outside

  hm said admiral wetherbee i expected you to
turn to the outside some day  but not as a civilian
no i was quite sure youd be a navy wife

  ill never marry a navy man i wont sit home worry-
ing and waiting like the families of those men in the
starfish like my mother used to do id want a home
not here today and gone tomorrow but one home-for
always

  she got restlessly from the chair and looked out of the
porthole full darkness lay on the sea but the algonquins
lights rode the swells over yonder and she could see mast-
head blinkers winking on a destroyer which was standing
by beyond

  there were navy men on the algonquin who hadnt
given up fighting men brave beyond the line of duty each
time they volunteered to dive two hundred and forty feet
down under that rolling shifting pressure

  the admiral said softly they brought three more of
them aboard this evening evelyn  yes there are easier
ways of making a living than being in the navy

  his voice became gruff again sit down i sent for
you because i wanted to talk about the murder

  evelyn obeyed we dont seem to be getting any-
where she sighed evidence points to thorpe but it
couldnt have been that boy

  could have been anybody said the admiral think
youre right though not that thorpe wouldnt be capa-
ble of murder-i havent more than had a glimpse or two
at him you understand but psychologists say that all of
us are potentially killers

  but i dont think it was thorpe because whoever
murdered mcquaid was a colder shrewder more cal-
culating type an older person

  whom do you suspect

  the admiral shook his head too long a list to go over
but im afraid we havent seen the last of it you be very
careful lock your door and keep a sharp lookout at all
times dont go out on deck after dark

 you mean-

  there was a knock at the door the admiral lowered
his voice the murderer is still a shipmate of ours he
said come in

  it was vince ayres the light glinted from his glasses
his long face was grave and pale evelyn rose slowly an
unasked question in her eyes

  mike way vince said hes disappeared

tt took a minute for the full significance of these
words to make itself felt evelyn was dimly conscious
of the decks lift and fall two successive swells rolled be-
neath the consolation and she thought men disappear
only in one way at sea

  an incredibly sharp picture unrolled before her like a
movie flashback mike ways silhouette against the twi-
light sky and the tossing sea and barbara wests slinking
approach behind his back

  she tried to shut her mind against this before it went
on into a scene of her minds own invention   

  vince was talking -at supper all right but i had


argosy

the word passed for him and no luck then i called on
the master-at-arms force they searched all the way down
to the double bottoms he isnt aboard

  did you report this to captain mckee asked the
admiral

  vince nodded i had to they turned searchlights on
the water but didnt find anything then-he bit his
lip-a seaman found his cap on deck forward

  the way this sea is running if a man fell over the side
hed have to be a pretty good swimmer to keep afloat
very long

  he was breaking things gradually evelyn realized
out of consideration for her

  vince knew that mike way practically worshiped the
deck everett brill walked on and that if brill were ac-
cused in the loss of his ship mikes testimony might
prove of great value

  the big chief torpedoman had been in the control room
when the starfish made her trial dives   

  the admiral rumbled its not likely he fell over id
just reminded evelyn that we still are shipmates with a
murderer and its my belief doctor that the killer will
strike again

  young lady let me see the notes you took today

  he skimmed through them rapidly turning back now
and then to read some passages twice the girl and vince
ayres sat in silence

  evelyn told herself it was impossible for barbara west
to have been responsible for mike ways disappearance
oh a child might be able to push a man over the side but
a man as big and strong as mike way would have to be
unconscious before he hit the water else-

utt doesnt tie in the admiral complained it
-imight have alittle bit until this thing happened
way couldnt have known what happened aft in the
starfish like mcquaid way didnt hold a grudge against
the captain like mcquaid he thought theres no better
skipper in the navy

  nothing ties in vince said bitterly a sudden thought
struck him unless mike way discovered something we
dont know about unless he stumbled onto something
just tonight and the murderer knew it

  a pharmacists mate who wore a white laboratory apron
looked in the door saw vince ayres and entered

  excuse me dr ayres he said weve finished the
microscopic and chemical examination of that billiard cue
apparently the rain washed away practically everything
but-

  vince was impatient but what

  there is an unmistakable trace of blood sir on the
cues heavy end

  vince looked quickly at the other two evdyn said
that boy and the admiral frowned quizzically

  very well vince said slowly thank you and
you will please make a written report of your findings
but keep it secret

   aye aye sir

admiral wetherbee looked up when the man had
gone theres enough circumstantial evidence of
course to hang young thorpe but circumstantial evi-
dence isnt enough and im against it

  youre a doctor you saw mcquaid could that
billiard cue been the murder weapon

   if enough blows were struck i think it could have
vince said my impression would be that something
heavier was used unfortunately i didnt have time to
make a more thorough examination

   therell be a post-mortem at the hospital of course
the admiral kid now youve questioned thorpe and
had an opportunity to observe him what do you think
you know his type admiral they join the navy too
young to adjust themselves to a mans outfit theyre the
ones who get most of the inaptitude discharges

  thorpe probably was something of a mammas boy
on the outside he undoubtedly came in for a lot of
razzing and horseplay in the navy add to that the very
severe nervous shock suffered in the starfish and you have
a person who might well develop a complex or a fixation

   but in thorpes case youd scarcely expect it to find
an outlet in murder

  the admiral nodded are you going to have him
thrown in the brig

  what good would that do asked vince he cant
very well get away id like to watch him for the present

     evelyn left presently and vince ayres walked down
the passageway with her turning aside to go to the radio
room as they parted he caught her hand and squeezed
it briefly

   tired he asked

   a little it seems ten years since-since all this began
to happen

   i know it does evelyn youre dead game but youre
too lovely-too sweet-to be in any place where you can
get mixed up in such a tragic mess after its all cleared
up i-

   she interrupted good night vince will you let me
know if they find out anything-about mike way i
mean

   of course he said huskily and looked after her with
a strange expression

   she locked the door of her room and for a long while
she leaned by the porthole watching the algonquins
lights signal blinkers were going like fireflies caught at
the masthead and she could see the faint stirring of men
on deck

   still diving she thought and a sense of the passage of
time struck her with a sudden pang

   those men in the starfish had been waiting nearly sixty
hours

   radio uss consolation eleventh  bt
   simmons intelligence nineteenth naval bt

chapter xii

the dead dont walk

captain mckee of the consolation sent for vince
he was a medical corps officer but if there had been
stars on his sleeves instead of maple leaves no more mili-
tary-looking line officer could have been found afloat

   as it was navigational duties and the responsibility for
the operation of the ship fell upon a line officer of com-
manders rank

   the tall erect doctor was at his desk when vince en-
murder goes to sea



tered and he stood on no military ceremony now he
motioned to a chair and offered vince a cigar

  this chief who disappeared he began way a
very good man i understand

  yes sir vince said there was a saying that chief
petty officers were the backbone of the navy it applied
vince thought to the brass-buttoned men of mike ways
caliber

  he had something like twelve years service the
captain went on he was a master diver record-i
have it here-is perfect

  cited for bravery over and beyond the line of duty in
diving to recover the bodies of five men killed in the crash
of a pb-y plane cited for heroism in the rescue of a
seaman who fell overboard from the destroyer bolton
i didnt know about that sir vince said and i
had him for a patient once-with the bends he was
modst

  he wondered what captain mckee was getting at the
captain rose and paced thoughtfully across the deck

  it would be a shame to spoil such a record wouldnt it
i mean if technically the chief had deserted-or jumped
ship

  i dont understand vince said do you mean-
i mean-mckee smiled-that chief mike way isnt
lost at sea at all no by golly and i dont think a man
with his courage and stamina ever will be he merely
swam over to the algonquin he reported aboard and
asked permission to be allowed to dive

  why the big damned fool vince exclaimed with
those ribs of his he kept asking me if i could fix up a
transfer and i put him off i told him to wait

  captain mckee nodded grimly and its hard to wait
while your shipmates are on the bottom it was too hard
for mike way well hes over there now the captain
of the algonquin reported a little while ago and im won-
dering what to do

  vince shook his head well if a man can swim a
quarter of a mile

  thats what i thought by golly if the medical of-
ficer in the algonquin will let him dive why should we put
a red mark on a record like his i wanted to ask you
youre in charge of this murder inquiry do you need
way

  no vince said he smiled picturing the surprise on
the salvage tug when the big ugly diver came splashing
alongside and called for a line no sir i may have to
ask him some questions later but they can wait and i
hope hes lucky 

  i hope captain mckee said fervently that gods
holding on to his lifeline when hes forty fathoms down

itince called evelyn brill on her room telephone and
 told her the good news he heard the quick joyous
catch of her breath and a sound suspiciously like sobbing

  he laughed and said now you can sleep evelyn
and ive got a hunch that things are going to break for
us-that this mess will be straightened out

  she was her fathers daughter she said if anybody
can secure that downhaul cable in a sea like this its
mike way

  vince went out on deck for a breath of fresh air only
the standing lamps were burning casting their bluish
unreal glow in little circles a thin scudding of clouds
blew across the sky and shrouded a moon that had a

luminous ring around it that was a familiar portent

  more stormy weather vince thought and watched the
lights of a new ship coming up over the rolling swells
somebody called up to the bridge and the signalman of
the watch answered that she was the westsal-westcos
salvage ship

  and then martin west puffed out on deck his seasick-
ness past with foster bedell and victor melhorne fol-
lowing him respectfully

  they watched from the rail until the westsal had an-
chored and was swinging with the tide

  west said ill want you both over there to direct
operations well have to act quickly pacific maritime is
probably already trying to move in on the government
contracts we should have

  melhornes thin voice said if we can get away from
fhis damned murder investigation but foster bedell
was more positive he said quietly ill go aboard her in
the morning mr west

  they turned below talking earnestly and in a low tone
vince lighted the cigar captain mckee had given him
and watched the dark swinging rush of the water by the
ships side

  anything to help speed the rescue of those twenty-five
men in the starfish- if melhorne and bedell were needed
to direct the salvage operations on the civilian ship the
murder inquiry could wait

  he heard a light footfall across the deck and turned
casually what he saw brought him around watching
tensely

  a man in pajamas and a navy white hat-a barefoot
man-was walking yonder with a strange mechanical gait
his hands thrust before him john thorpe

tn that instant the danger of the lads going over the
--side struck vince ayres and he was torn between the
wish to watch thorpe for a minute and the wisdom of
seizing him immediately

  he started softly across the deck and thorpe saved
him from having to make a decision thorpe turned and
entered the passageway that led between two of the wards

  vince ayres followed it was after taps and the lights
were dim nobody else was stirring thorpe came to a
ladder leading to the deck below and went part of the
way down it

  the hand chains rattled but the young sailor still moved
as if he were asleep from above vince could see the
stenciled name on the brim of the white hat thorpe
john

  thorpe turned slowly and came back up his eyes
apparently unseeing looked straight at the doctor he
moved aft along the passageway

  a buzzer sounded and vince saw the red light go on
above a door admiral wetherbees door

  a hospital corpsman came from the nurses office just as
vince passed it the doctor reached out to catch the
corpsmans arm

  wait a minute he whispered wait till this man
gets by

  the surprised corpsman nodded and just then john
thorpe turned into the admirals room

  swift speculation flashed through vinces mind as he
sprang forward could a buzzer and a red light make
their impression on the subconsciousness of a sleepwalker
causing him to deviate from his course


argosy

 could the loud breathing and the mutterings of a man
 in a coma have done the same drawing john thorpe
 through that hospital window when he held a potentially
 murderous club in his hands

 thorpe had closed the door behind him vince opened
 it quietly he saw the admiral propped up as high
 as his bad leg would allow his wide-awake sea-blue eyes
 following every move of the sleepwalker

 admiral wetherbee put his finger across his lips vince
 nodded and took up a position by the door

 thorpe went to the bulkhead by the porthole touched it
 and turned he came back brushed against the admirals
 bedside table and halted there

 then he touched the top of the table-and picked up
 the admirals logbook

 a water glass slid from the table and fell to the deck
 it struck thorpes bare foot

 the boy let out a startled cry and looked wildly around
 him where-what-

 easy said vince ayres he caught thorpes arm
 and steered him to a chair sit down a minute

 thorpe was trembling and there was a sobbing catch
 to his breath he moaned i did it again i-i was
 asleep doctor walking in my-sleep again

 looks that way vince said just be quiet a minute
 youre all right

 thorpe drew a long shuddering breath the admiral
 and vince ayres looked at each other silently vince took
 the logbook from the sailors clutching hand and replaced
 it on the table

 what time did you go to bed thorpe he asked in
 a kindly tone

 about nine i guess sir

 lets see you have a roommate havent you

yes sir wop-wop cardoni sir he was already
in bed i guess

 dont you know for certain

 well the light was out doctor and i didnt want to
 wake him i saw his clothes on the chair

 dream anything vince asked

 no sir-yes i did too that i was down in the
 submarine

 will you sound your buzzer again admiral vince
 requested	

 and when the corpsman came give this man fifteen
 grains of sodium bromide and see that he turns in

 go back to bed thorpe and well talk about this to-
 morrow this time lock your door and put the key where
 you cant possibly get it without waking yourself by the
 effort

 thorpe said they wont kick me out of the navy will
 they doctor

 dont worry about that vince answered you need
 a rest try getting it

 yes sir thank you sir

 the admiral motioned to the night duty corpsman
 when you cotne back jones look in the diet kitchen and
 see if you can find me a cold turkey leg

the two enlisted men went out thorpe was still
shaken and dazed the admiral looked at vince ayres
well he inquired

 if youre asking me whether his somnambulism is real-
 i dont know but id say that if it isnt that boy is do-

 ing a good job as an actor a very remarkable job
 i didnt mean that said the admiral but isnt it
 rather curious that he should come in here and especially
 that he picked up the logbook

  that log of mine has some quite valuable data bearing
on this murder mystery im wondering if this was an at-
tempt to steal it that is supposing of course that the
lad was really awake

  vince shook himself what would be his object in
faking he demanded you heard him ask if he might
be kicked out of the navy and you know as well as i
that a man who walks in his sleep is a risky person to
have at sea no telling when he might walk over the side

  oh somnambulists do strange things ive heard of
cases where they buried money or valuables and couldnt
remember later what theyd done there was a mental
quirk there call it a fixation if you wish the idea that
the money was in danger of being stolen had preyed on
the subconscious

  perhaps thorpe went to sleep thinking about your
logbook

tfhat sort of tools did the sleepwalkers dig with
 when they buried money asked admiral wether-
bee could a man wield a pick for instance without
waking himself

  i dont remember that the case histories related that
detail vince said and i suppose it would depend on
the individual as to how soundly he slept its rather hard
to believe that thorpe is the murderer

  dont think he is the admiral answered but if a
sleepwalker could swing a pick he could club a mans
skull if theres any such thing as somnambulism in con-
nection with schizophrenia-

  he snapped his gaunt jaw shut suddenly down the
passageway somewhere forward there was a frightened
cry another came close on the sound and the two men
heard the swift excited patter of running feet

  vince ayres pushed himself from his chair curiously
noting the high and strained hysteria in the cry

  the night duty corpsman-jones-shoved the door open
and stood in it incongruously the admirals turkey leg on
a platter he was holding and frightened excitement in his
face more men were stirring somebody called for the
master-at-arms

  well jones barked the admiral whats happened
jones swallowed murder he said and the hoarse
word let him move again he came forward putting down
the platter with a shaking hand the turkey leg rolled
from the plate and the admiral made a futile grab for it
before it struck the deck

  who demanded vince ayrescatching the corpsmans
shoulder but kowalski ran into the room before jones
could answer-kowalski of the starfish survivors pajama-
clad and barefoot with his curly hair tousled

  its wop sir he told vince ayres its cardoni
hes been strangled to death in his room

chapter xiii

questions for the admiral

the room cardoni had shared with john thorpe was on
the deck below vince ayres hurried to it but as he
rattled the hand chains down the nearby ladder he saw

argosy march  
murder goes to sea



that fully a dozen men had preceded him and were stand-
ing-some only half dressed-in the passageway

  somebody cried gangway and captain mckee came
out tall and commanding and now wearing a worried
expression he said sharply break it up men all of
you get back to your bunks except the master-at-arms
force

  he saw vince then come in here doctor another
job for you-and i dont envy you in the least

  vince pushed through the scatter of sailors is there
any hope of resuscitation

  no said mckee hes dead he was killed in a slow
and diabolically clever fashion after first being stunned
the murderer needed to be in this room only half a minute
or so he could have been up on deck when this man died
or anywhere else look for yourself

  vince ayres removed his gold-rimmed glasses and wiped
an imagined speck of dust from their clearness before he
entered the little room

  he saw john thorpe first the boy was trembling in
the rooms only chair his face buried in shaking hands and
his elbows resting on the writing desk the watch officer
a young junior grade lieutenant stood by the wash basin
and its mirror

  and in the mirror vince saw john joseph cardonis
body

  he was in the lower bunk half-raised into a sitting pos-
ture that would have been impossible to maintain vince
thought he saw the man move and jerked his eyes from
the reflection to cardoni himself

  there was a stout but slender rope-line the navy calls
it-tied to the under side of the upper bunk above car-
donis head it ran down a foot or so looped around car-
donis neck and then extended out the open porthole

  every time a swell ran along the side of the consolation
lifting the ship over it cardonis torso lifted a few inches
when the swell had passed it settled back

  his splinted broken arm was still in its sling the other
arm dangled over the side of the bunk his dark face
looked almost purple now and his tongue protruded
through ghastly lips

  marlin hitch said captain mckee at vinces side
its used to lash navy hammocks you know

  but whats on the other end of that line vince de-
manded

  a bucket a navy bucket it catches the full force of
the tide its like a sea-anchor dragging against this mans
neck its enough to decapitate him if it were left there
long enough

  good lord vince exclaimed this matched the
horror of mcquaids murder back at the base hospital
this was a sample of the terror that had come to sea with
the seven men who had already gone through hell on the
bottom of the pacific

  six men now vince thought and the significance of
this murder struck him all at once first mcquaid now
cardoni 

  there was only one man left who had escaped from the
after compartment of the starfish john thorpe

captain mckee was talking he was struck on his
forehead first if youll look more closely you can
see the place despite the general discoloration what with
i cant say the bucket itself probably theres a broom
locker just down the passageway thats where the bucket

came from the captain gloomily surveyed the room
  who found him vince asked

  thorpe said the captain

  and thorpe moaned i dont know anything about it
i came in here without turning on the light and i thought-
i thought he was sitting up and then i-i touched his
hand

  vince pounced on this you mean his hand was- he
began and then checked himself what about his hand
thorpe

  it was cold the boy shuddered

  captain mckee shook his head hed been dead for
some time doctor i should say he was killed at least
two hours ago

  vince looked sharply at the four-stripe medical officer
mckee ought to know but thorpe had been walking
around deck only half an hour ago before wandering into
the admirals room   

  thorpe vince said who went to bed first you or
cardoni

  he did sir i was up on deck and when i came down
here to turn in the light was out i couldnt see anything
but i didnt want to wake him up i undressed in the
dark and-and all the time he was dead

  two hours or more ago vince looked at his watch it
was only ten-thirty now two hours ago there had been
all kinds of people moving around the ship topside and
below	

  mike way had gone over the side for his swim to the
algonquin at perhaps half past seven or eight barbara
west had been on deck and later her father and victor
melhorne and foster bedell evelyn brill had been in
admiral wetherbees room perhaps two hours ago

  this murder trail he thought bitterly was even colder
than the one he had been trying to follow since that rainy
midnight at the hospital only last midnight it was
twice in less than twenty-four hours the killer had struck

captain mckee turned on thorpe i thought you
said you discovered that he was dead when you
climbed into that upper bunk when you touched his hand
i did sir thorpe looked up his eyes wide and his
thin face twitching that was after i-you tell him dr
ayres

  vince hesitated thorpe he said slowly is a sleep-
walker he walked in his sleep at the hospital he walked
tonight and i followed him into admiral wetherbees
room there--

  good lord exploded the captain youve known
this and permitted him to roam about the ship he
might walk over the side

  id like to talk over the details of his case with you
captain vince said in private

  mckee looked at him sharply very well i suppose
we havent a prayer when it comes to fingerprints here
cant get prints off a line if there are any left on the
bucket after its been in the water this long they would
include those of half our deck force

  well come with me dr ayres phillips take over
here and take care of this man and i want a master-at-
arms on each deck with a watch of at least two men-i
want the ship patrolled at all times

  aye aye sir said the watch officer

  vince ayres looked back at cardoni the master-at-
arms was hauling in the bucket and the murdered mans


argosy

grotesque sea-controlled movement ceased his body
sank back to the bunk as slack was taken in the line

  thorpe saw this and sprang up in alarm i cant stay
here sir ive got to-ive got to get away from that

  turn into one of the bunks in that isolation ward
vince ordered and lock the door

tn captain mckees cabin vince went over the

  young sailors somnambulism in detail while the four-
stripe medical officers face grew grave

  youre in charge of the murder investigation of course
mckee said finally but this is my ship and its my
responsibility if that boy walks over the side not every
man can swim like that chief torpedoman

  i know vince said wearily but if hes locked up
im afraid some of my chances of getting to the bottom
of this mess will be locked up with him i wanted to keep
him under observation a little longer

  ive told you about the club he was found carrying
and about the blood on it and now he sleepwalks-and
his roommate is murdered i wonder if it i possible

  mckee stared at him that a man could commit two
murders in his sleep he said certainly perhaps it
isnt exactly sleep-perhaps his condition is at such times
more of a self-hypnosis and-

  he paused then shook his head no ayres im afraid
were off on the wrong tack i cant imagine a man in
such a condition being so damned clever as to kill cardoni
the way he was killed youve got to look for somebody
else

  vince ayres drew a deep breath and find him too
he said he has to be found quick before the killer
strikes again

ttor a long time after vince ayres called her to say
 that mike way was safe evelyn brill stood at the
porthole in her room and watched the dark sea running
under the moon

  swells ran rhythmically along the side of the ship they
might have been melody transmuted to liquid and touched
lightly by the moon sparkle-a melody to which the ship
danced

  this fancy was a soothing thought to dwell upon and
evelyn tried to pick out the three-quarter beat of a waltz
as she watched the surging roll

  but the sea was faster more savage like a march she
thought

  the memories of a dozen navy parade grounds came
back to her bands playing blue-clad men swinging
across asphalt with all the reckless salty disdain of the
seaman for strict military formations and customs and a
little girl in pigtails watching thrilling to anchors aweigh
the blue and gold on parade   

  admiral wetherbees dry old voice saying yes there
are easier ways of making a living than being in the
navy

  and the tempo of the sea changed there was a new
note in the wild symphony of wind and wave there were
clouds darkening the ringed moon and the only light
came from the algonquin as she pitched  yonder

  evelyn listened to a tympanic clatter that beat with all
the insistence of jungle drums against the ships side
she thrust her head out of the porthole and looked down

  a line faintly straggling in the gloom ran from a port-
hole that was below and forward and dipped in the sea

 the thing that hammered against the hull the girl de-
 cided must be a bucket some member of the consolations
 crew was probably intending to wash clothes

 she went to bed the tympany continued it was in
 her ears dimly like a thing only half remembered when
 she fell asleep

                 full crash dive

                       i

 tifike way had a last cup of coffee in the chill mom-
 ing and smoked a final cigarette while the bears
 dressed him for his dive

 he felt a sense of elation of victory over the most
 difficult portion of his task they had consented to let him
 go down the doctor in the algonquin would never know
 how the big chief torpedoman had to set his teeth against
 the pain in his taped ribs while the doctors fingers ex-
 plored that area

 that hurt the doctor had inquired any tender-
 ness there

 mike way lied no sir i feel fine sir

 a man had to lie for his shipmates those twenty-
 five men in the starfish forty fathoms down under this
 gray heaving sea

 he didnt know that the doctor was echoing vince
 ayres words of the night before he only heard the
 doctor tell the algonquins skipper well if a man can
 swim a quarter of a mile i guess he can dive

 the doctor put away his stethoscope and the skipper
 grunted the skippers eyes were bright with an admira-
 tion that belied his words

captain mckees being easy with you chief he
murder goes to sea



could have run you up for jumping ship leaving your post
he signaled that if you were in shape to dive let you dive
and by god im praying for you

  thank you sir mike way had said simply

  he had on a couple of suits of woolen underwear and
three pairs of socks he tossed his cigarette over the side
where the gray water sucked greedily at the algonquins
rust-stained scuppers and took his time getting into the
lead-weighted boots and the rubberized diving suit he
sat on a tool box and the bears put the heavy breastplate
over his wide shoulders

  you want to watch your step chief one of them said
as they adjusted the plate to receive his helmet that
descending line puts you aft on the starfish near the
after rescue hatch you got to work your way forward
you got to watch your lines understand

  mike way understood now he knew the topside of
that pigboat as he knew the inside of his hand but he
also fully understood the thick-headedness the mental
lethargy bordering on coma that came so swiftly over a
man under the pressure of two hundred and forty odd feet

  remember that chief you got to go forward and
keep your lines clear 

fphe helmet went over mike ways head he looked
- like a cyclops now he looked like a strange creature
from mars they screwed his helmet into place leaving
the face port open and they buckled the forty-pound belt
around his waist connecting it with shoulder braces and
the crotch strap

  test your telephone

  mike way said one two three four

  okay his talker reported from the other end of the
line mike twisted the control valve on his left chest
and heard the compressed air spurt into his suit the
helpers looped his life air and telephone lines down his
back under his arms and up across his chest where they
were secured his helmet port was closed and dogged
down to airtight integrity with a wrench

  somebody tapped twice on the copper helmet mike
way rose under weight that would have nailed a less
powerful man to the deck and was guided to the steel
grating of the diving platform he gripped the bails with
his mittened hands and waited

  hoist away

  a winch puffed on the algonquins boat deck the div-
ing stage lifted a few feet and the boom was swung out-
board past the rail it started down

  the gray sea came rolling mike way could not look
down but out there on a level with his eyes he saw the
swells lift and surge the wind skimmed spray from their
crests a seagull rode buoyantly up a steepening slant
and over it was lost now behind the foam-dappled lip
of the wave

  there were tons of water in each of those swells chang-
ing the pressure that would push against mike ways rub-
berized diving suit-changing it constantly

  he felt the jar as water struck the diving stage plat-
form it receded but it came again and this time it lapped
with a cold greedy tongue at his legs

  water came up to his face port and swished across it
the stage stopped its descent mike way spoke into his
telephone

  take me to the descending line

  they lifted him from the platform and carefully moved

him along the lee of the tug he wrapped his left arm
around the line and began going down

  around him was a weird green translucence that was
gradually darkening the light faded with each deepen-
ing roll of the sea

  he could feel the breast plate slam against his chest
every time a swell passed above he had to valve air quickly
into his suit to meet this increased pressure and he had
to be careful not to over-inflate the suit and create a
positive buoyancy that would shoot him out of the water
the drag of his forty-pound belt and shoes that weighed
almost half that apiece pulled him down to the accompany-
ing roar of the compressed air in his helmet

  topside on the algonquin where the nine-ton rescue
chamber waited on mike ways success or failure the
skipper turned from the rail

  signalman he called message for captain mckee
on the consolation iron man mike way dived at 

tn the isolation ward of the consolation vince ayres
-was preparing to resume the inquiry into the murder
that had taken place on land and to launch a new inves-
tigation into the one that had been committed on the high
sea

  he had the word passed for his party to lay below to
the ward and he waited there with evelyn brill

  she had not been told of cardonis death until morning
consequently she had slept despite the worry over her
fathers arrest and vince had never seen her more beauti-
ful he wanted to tell her this and other things but it
was neither the time nor place and so he cursed himself
for having wasted a dozen opportunities ashore before
murder followed on tragedy and said instead

  i ought to hear from simmons-the intelligence man-
today if he can find out anything important ashore we
may get somewhere we might establish a motive

  some murders evelyn said hesitantly are com-
mitted without motives and arent they usually this type
brutal and still apparently cleverly planned a man with
a motive is apt to let it drive him hell kill at the first
opportunity hell take chances	

  im not so sure both of these murders werent com-
mitted at the first opportunity vince said what you
say is quite true but murder without motive means in-
sanity in one of its many forms and the answer to that
would be thorpe

  i didnt want to think he was guilty the girl said
but after what happened last night-i dont know
vince lighted a cigarette murphy the redheaded corps-
man from sick officers quarters came in and waited re-
spectfully across the room jacobs joined him and then
the mouselike miss wilkins vince looked at his watch 
thorpe may not realize how lucky he is that civil
police arent trying to find this murderer and that news-
papers arent screaming that the fiend is still at large i he
told evelyn in a low tone because after last night
theres enough circumstantial evidence to hang the boy a
dozen times over but im still reluctant to believe hes
the one we want

z owalski entered soberly it was easy to see a
difference in the attitude of the enlisted men one
of them-kowalskis shipmate-had been killed last night

  then martin west puffed in his pudgy face still gray
with anxiety and his eyes red from sleeplessness barbara


argosy

west followed with victor melhorne and foster bedell
vince ayres handed evelyn a typewritten list the muster
roll he had used when the party boarded the consolation

  will you please check the names miss brill he said
in a businesslike manner good morning everybody
barbara west smiled sweetly and nodded she was
wearing a knitted sports costume of blue and there was
that warmth in melhornes pale chill eyes when he looked
at her

  john thorpe isnt here yet evelyn reported

  she handed the list of names back to vince he said
murphy run out and have the word passed for thorpe
see the master-at-arms and have him find him

  aye aye sir the redheaded corpsman responded

  and now martin west came forward importantly doc-
tor he said my salvage ship the westsal is anchored
over yonder as you know

  i know vince said quietly you want mr melhorne
and mr bedell to be permitted to go aboard her

  yes-thats it west looked surprised

  im in favor of anything that will help rescue those
men in the starfish vince went on he looked at his
watch there will be a boat shoving off for the algonquin
in twenty minutes im sure the officer of the deck will
order the coxn to take mr melhorne and mr bedell to
the westsal on that same trip

  bedell came up smiling warmly thanks doctor
he said if you want to hold a night session when we
return-

  vince nodded we can decide that later thanks for
your willingness to cooperate melhorne was talking to
barbara west yonder by the door she said please be
careful vic and vince ayres looked past them and saw
murphy coming back

  the belted master-at-arms was with the corpsman he
said dr ayres thorpe is missing

ince saw a smile twist off barbara wests face ko-
 walski gasped missing and looked around him
queerly like a man who suddenly finds himself utterly
alone jeeze he said somebody gave him the deep
six and im the only one left im the only one the
murderer can get at now

  vince heard the wordless little cry in evelyns throat
he said slowly but thorpe slept here last night in
this ward he was told to lock the door 

  we found his pajamas and his white hat here sir
the master-at-arms explained he wasnt at quarters to
answer muster and then the admiral-admiral wether-
bee-had a search started i guess the admiral thinks it
was suicide sir from what he said

  martin west seemed to have recovered a great deal of
his confidence and his nerve he said doctor if you
think this solves the murders lets have an end to this
business i should be ashore ive got important gov-
ernment work to supervise  theres no earthly reason
why either my daughter or i should have to remain on
this ship 

  except vince said that nothing is solved

  but if thorpe drowned himself barbara west put in
that was a confession of guilt

  vince had no chance to replyvictor melhornes thin
voice snapped this whole affair dr ayres has been
bungled im a civilian and criticism of the investigation
may not be within my province im not affected one way

or the other by what an old man like the admiral-in his
second childhood-thinks but the fact remains that
failure to arrest thorpe was gross negligence

  vic barbara west said pleadingly dont make a
scene

   go on mr melhorne vince said grimly

t intend to the pale-eyed man declared stiffly

     furthermore if a more responsible hearing is con-
vened later ill make it my duty to say the same thing
you had excellent reasons for locking thorpe in the brig

   if you believed he was a somnambulist he should have
been put there for his own protection if he was the
murderer-and every shred of evidence pointed to him-
he should have been locked up for our protection

  vince went back a way to ask a question you con-
sider the admirals opinions worthless then

  i do melhorne said coldly if you want me to be
frank id say youre a fool for paying any attention to
him and his log

  mr melhorne vince said it may be unfortunate
that you arent in charge of this inquiry it happens that
i am conducting it and that i believe if we ever do solve
the mystery it will be largely because that log of admiral
wetherbees holds the key

  he glanced at his watch you have a boat to catch
and i will have questions to ask you latef

   melhorne started to reply heatedly but foster bedell
took his arm no use getting all steamed up vic he
said good-naturedly the doctors doing the best he can
sorry dr ayres

  they went out vince said humbly there may be
quite a lot of truth in mr melhornes criticism but well
carry on mr west id like to ask you a few questions
if youll step jnto the office	

a ft in his room admiral wetherbees shaggy brows

     frowned over another logbook-the one a yeoman had
handed to mike way as the big torpedoman climbed out
of the escape hatch on the starfish

  two husky hospital corpsmen came with a wheelchair
and the information that they had been detailed to lift
the admiral into it but he roared them away-and added
in a softer tone as they fled to the door that hed make
the transfer later

   for a long time afterward he studied the pages of the
book that had been closed so soon after its beginning

   after that the gaunt old man lay back on his pillows
and hungrily watched the sea and sky alternate in th
circle of his porthole finally he took his own log froi
the bedside locker and began to write

      commenced swinging to flood tide stern to
  starboard

     receipted for log of uss starfish began
  perusal of same

      informed instructions carried out concerning
   thorpe john sea c usn

    log of starfish trials reveals remarkable ad-
  herence to schedules drawn up by her cgmmanding of-
  ficer two weeks prior to execution of test runs dives
  scheduled thus fourteen days in advance performed on

     this is significant everybody aboard knew far ahead
   of time that submarine would make full crash dive at

to be continued next week
  and a hickory tree

ver the tackroom roof there was a platform of
two-by-sixes with a couple of old swivel chairs
bolted down to it mr laird noble always went
up there to do his heavy thinking by just swiveling around
he could see not only the exercise tack but the brood mares
pasture the stallions corrals the house and the bam

  he swiveled now and the letter in his hip pocket crackled
dully it was pretty limp with reading and re-reading but
he pulled it out again foolish thing to do reading a let-
ter from a person who got home last night

  but he only had one child one daughter just diane a
hundred odd horses but just one child to leave them to
just one child to worry about and she-

  mr noble picked up the megaphone called to the stable
band working a sorrel around the track make him rack
around twice now without breaking jus keep his curb rein
tight like- thats right

  hard to get good riders especially out here in california
most of the ones who came along were show-off cowboys
get on a horse give him the spurs whoopee ride em cow-
boy

  only last week    mr noble looked down at the
knuckles of the hand holding the letter they were almost
healed up but the cowboy had told him as he trudged
down the road he had called it spitting blood and say-

a woman a horse and a hickory tree-the more
that you beat em the better they be its a
dubious maxim but it can be used to measure a
man-with or without violence

ing a woman a horse and a hickory tree-the more that
you beat em the better they be

  well hed always handled diane with a soft rein seems
what she wanted was a little beating now and then look
what she- but what kind of a way was that to be think-
ing like your only daughter was a horse

  he opened the letter skipped to the important para-
graph

    youll be pleased to know hes a horseman like your-
  self dad he can ride anything we went out to this
  ranch and they had a rodeo horse there and michael
  stayed up for ninety-two seconds which everybody said
  was a record why cant the nobles have some bucking
  horses michaels coming out right after    

  mr noble put the letter away- his ears and eyes and
even his nose checked up on the progress of things on the
noble ranch the even whirring of the mower told him






argosy

ranny his foreman was cutting hay too long and too hard

for a man his age

  he saw that the horse now coming out on the track was
belles starlight and he leaned forward it was starlight
the cowboy had hit square across the face with a rope end
but starlight was getting over his nervousness now

  bucking horses there were two kinds of bucking horses
-misborn ones and mishandled ones the noble ranch
had bred its own stock for three generations and so there
were no crazy hammerheads on it and the kind of hand
who made a horse buck only did it once before he was
sent elsewhere to beat his horses and his women and his
hickory trees

a door slammed and diane came out on the terrace
looking pretty fine in jodhpurs mr noble admired
his slim dark-haired daughter without prejudice or reserva-
tions for a full minute

  he would be fair about this michael maybe riding an
untrained horse to a finish was the way to do the holly-
wood people who were mr nobles chief customers now-
adays wanted flashy colors flashy gaits in their horses
since the war horses were no longer useful they were just
pleasure animals and if a few bucks gave the owner
pleasure why not it would sure be a cheaper way to raise
em

  he yelled through the megaphone goin ridin diane
want your horse	x

  golly she was pretty outlined against the sage and
greasewood of the ridge of the santa monica beautiful as
these hills it wasnt what this michael did to horses it
was what a rough-breaker would do to a wife

  she was shaking her head she made a horn out of her
hands yelled back coming up to see you dad
good he yelled back

  the platform creaked as diane came up beside him put
her hand on his shoulder and leaned against him she
wanted something

  he patted the hand on his shoulder sit down i want
to watch starlight trot once and then ive got to go up to
the yearlings come on along your mothers got the
house so full of the dusting brigade theres no room for
you anyway

  oh let the old yearlings go for once dad im just
home darling i was too sleepy to talk to you last night
honest sometimes i think you think more of the horses
than you do of me

  years of not moving when he was surprised-lest a green
horse tremble-kept the shoulder his daughter rested on
from jumping did he think more of his horses than he
did of his daughter

  hot out here mr noble said dry he mopped
his brow moistened his lips with his tongue

  michaels coming out this afternoon diane said
mi-chael she pulled the name out long and caressing
on her tongue

  mr noble glanced towards the ridge the crest of the
mountains hid them from the san fernando valley and
hollywood was that where diane got those tricks the
great michael

  jealous darling now youre not my favorite man any
more

  if my grandpa was alive hed say you were a minx
mr noble said he used the megaphone dont let star-
light canter there son keep him trottin

  oh let him go diane said hed run himself down
soon enough

  backs not strong enough to canter yet mr noble
said and besides a horse ought to be made to trot till
hes got a good gait

  then he could have bitten his tongue off hed sounded

too eager diane was twenty-three and since she was
twelve hed kept hoping shed take a real interest in horses
whenever she asked a question though he answered too
fast and he guessed bored her

  oh she rode all right hed had her taught at the school
shed boarded at over in pasadena man couldnt teach
his own youngsters he tried too hard

  daaaad

  i got to get up to those yearlings come along and sif
on the fence and tell me all about denver

  wont it frighten the yearlings to have me talk

  do em good to get used to it if it does your aunt
beth give a lot of parties for you mr noble went down
the stairs first reached into the tackroom for the old sad-
dle and coil of cotton rope he used on the yearlings come
on sister he picked up the bag of carrots ready for the
morning lesson

  she was taller than he remembered he glanced down
diane whered you get those cowboy boots

  had them made in denver she pulled the trousers of
her jodhpurs up so he could see the design pretty
pretty he agreed hanging the saddle and rope on the
pasture fence but i never could walk in em what you
want those slant heeled things for

  michaels teaching me how to rope diane said you
have to have cowboy heels to dig in when you got a live
one on the end oflyour rope pardner she laughed have
we got a roping saddle for michael did

  i had my grandfathers silver mounted mexican gone
over last year when the saddlemaker was out here he
offered me a thousand dollars for it so it must be in good
condition

  oh swellegant said diane

the yearlings crowded around him mr noble gave
them each a fragment of carrot and selected a black
morgan gelding he led blackie to the fence by his mane
made a rope halter out of a piece of cotton rope tied the
morgan to the fence

  the little horse promptly sat down on his haunches mr
noble looped the rope around blackies barrel just behind
the legs tapped the colt on the rump to make him slack up
and tied the loop so that every time blackie tried to sit
down he squeezed his own chest blackie stood his rope
slack

  diane said if you used a heavier rope he couldnt
break it

  this way he learns without fighting mr noble picked
up the saddle presented it to blackies nose slid it along
his neck and rested it on the back he gave blackie a piece
of carrot and girthed the saddle up been working on this
bunch for three weeks mr noble said got them now
so every one of them will stand for saddling without a
quaver blackie was the last

  michael says the kind of a horse he likes is one that
isnt caught till its three years old hell ride anything
diane said whether hes ever seen it before or not
must be quite a boy mr noble said releasing
blackie and going on to the next colt

  you could learn from anyone every man who was much
around horses knew something you didnt know and if
you were smart you learned it he would listen to this
michael after all diane loved the man there must be
something   was he worried about his stock his ranch
or was he worried about his daughter the ranch was
dianes

  he picked up his pile of cotton rope-lengths coiled them
neatly picked up the saddle lets go diane

  let me carry the saddle daaad

  listen diane he said stopping what do you want
whenever you drag my name out that way you want
and a hickory tree



something you spent all your allowance ill be glad to
give you some money itll be yours sooner or later any-
way

  why dad what a way to talk if all-

   what is it you want diane

  dad i bragged to michael about our horses so-
then all in a rush diane said dad theres an auction
sale in town today i saw the notice on your desk two
carloads of horses from utah

mr noble opened the door of the tackroom put the
saddle and ropes in threw the empty carrot bag into
a corner yes his voice surprised him it was as quiet
as a rattlers buzz

   dad lets you and me go in and buy a couple of horses
real cowboy horses

  for michael

   diane nodded she looked more like a little girl than
he had seen her in years like the little girl who had
played horse show on the office floor with the silver and
gold horses of the trophies

  of course your horses-

  our horses diane noble horses-

   are swell dad theyre wonderful and the prices they
bring in the sales and show horse people all over the coun-
try know about them but michael likes a horse with more
life

   life fire good grief a well-blooded horse could out-
run outjump outstay any jug-headed range scrub in the
world

   hell say the lifes been all ridden out of ours
   diane theres more to this than-

   honest daaad thats all

  he didnt know whether he believed her or not but
good lord she was twenty-three she had been going with
boys since she was fifteen if she thought that much about
this michael she ought to have him

   bring the car around to the barn diane while i get
the trailer out

   maybe it was all right this michael would only be out
here a week or so and old juan tripez down the canyon
was sad because he didnt have any horses any more now
 that he was old and poor tripez could have the horse he
was about to buy for the bucking michael only a week
or so and then it would be over

the auctioneer recognized him if that fool gal had
told him ahead of time he could have called a com-
mission buyer and had him pick up a horse now he was
in for it the auctioneer was a stout obnoxious man who
had once had the audacity to come out to the noble ranch
and suggest that he could move some of your cheaper
stock mr noble

   well hed told him off there was no cheaper stock on
the noble ranch

   he turned to diane now sister you be still if you
see a horse you think would be suitable for your buckaroo
put your hand in my pocket and squeeze my hand dont
go hopping up and down shouting or well have to mort-
gage the ranch to buy the horse in

   yes dad

   he looked sidewise her eyes were as bright as diamonds
in the rain excited horses or because galahad was
coming in that afternoon

   the auctioneer shouted to an assistant clear a space
on the grandstand there for mr noble of the noble ranch
gemmen we are honored today we got in our midst
mr laird noble of the noble ranch out in the santa
monicas-where is it mr noble topanga or malibu-
anyway gemmen mr noble whose folks been raisin
fine-blooded horses since there werent any white folks in

californy were mighty glad to have him here with us

  jus you sing out mr noble if you want anything in
this sale today and name your own price this is a straight-
forward auction gemmen as attested by the fact that such
a fine gemman like mr noble has brought himself yere

  you make the prices gemmen and we sell the hosses
and yere we go now the first hoss up is a part-arabian
stock horse locally bred and locally known hes a good
sound hoss well-broke and well gaited

  four burly ruffians in high-heeled boots brought the
horse in they had two of their lariats around his neck and
a cowhand on his back and another cowhand leading the
horse by his spanish bit

  mr noble muttered easy there you fool youll break
his mouth

  diane whispered quiet dad the auctioneers looking
at you

  all right sister clenching his fists that way had
broken the scab across his knuckles was she getting a
kick out of seeing five men manhandle one horse

  they loosed their ropes and the man let go of the cruel
bit and the rider took the horse around the sawdust at a
dance he lifted the rein and the part-arabian cantered

  pretty diane muttered but theyre making him wild
hes tame as a mouse

  he ought to be mr noble whispered his back legs
been fired hes swaybacked and off his feed

  if michael thought these were horses  a succession
of strangely doctored beasts from a selling-out livery stable
passed through the ring diane lit a cigarette and gave her
father one

  not very good horses she confided but better than
the men looking at them what a bunch of tramps

the auctioneer was getting warmed up now youre
going to see them he said two carloads of good big
unbroken stock from utah palominos golddusts steel-
dusts appalachians pintos and buckskins any kind of
a hoss a man could want ifn hes man enough to break
em

  an assistant handed mr noble a mimeographed list
and one to diane he looked at it no  sorrel three-
year-old gelding out of a steeldust mare by a golddust
stallion

  diane said what does all this mean dad

  i dont know he said i think those are just colors
but maybe they have a studbook for these horses nothing
i evef heard before

  they were fine good-looking stock at that the cow-
hands would bring them in a rope halter on each horse
two men hanging on to the rope halter two more men
snubbing the horse back with lariats heavy ones with
slip-nooses that could choke a horse

  fine good looking stock for all their lack of pedigree
but every single one of em was marked rope-burns wire
cuts kick marks and diane was in love with a man who
treated stock like that

  of the thirty-four horses on the mimeographed list seven
were sold off but diane didnt move the horses looked
all right to mr noble-fair conformation good health
for range horses unblooded unbroken they looked as
good as youd want then   

  she was black she was sixteen-three darn big she
was three years old according to the catalogue by a mor-
gan stallion out of a morgan-grade mare

  here she is the auctioneer was screaming here she
is gem-men the hoss of yo dreams any movie people
here today heres a marell do to carry gene autry or
ride her yoself men and put gene autry out of a job
what am i bid gemmen am i bid two hundred

  he wasnt somebody finally gave him the nod at fifty
so

argosy

somebody else said sixty and the bidding hung there

  there was a rope burn on her neck but none on her
legs and there were no wire cuts a smart horse that didnt
get herself into messes handy mover too the men ran
her up and down a little couldnt tell her from a mor-
gan though she was only three-quarter bred according to
the sheet funny no one bid on her too much horse
maybe for these ruffians

  diane shoved her hand into her fathers pocket just in
time just before mr nobw began to worry about his
blood pressure he said seventy-five

  you hear gem-men man who knows more about
horses than all of us put together old mr noble and he
says seventyrfive she must be worth a hundred gemmen
she must be worth a hundred to you do i hear it do i
hear it

  mr noble finally got her for a hundred they were
scared of her scared for all their loud clothes and their
blustering hed see

  as he and diane backed the trailer around to the loading
chute he said you know horses sister

  she said i was going to ask you to bid on that first
horse dad but he wasnt big enough i want to see
michael ride a big horse and she was the biggest on the
sheet

  mr noble felt as though the new horse had kicked him
in the stomach with one of her wild hooves for a min-
ute hed thought blood had told and diane had inherited
the nobles talent for telling a horse-or a man but she
had just wanted a big horse she wanted action shed
get it

  hed stake his life that the kind of man who branded
cplts and beat two-year-olds and broke horses with a
quirt and spurs was yellow at heart a yellow wife-beat-
ing rat it would be hard on that lovely mare-but diane
was his daughter his only child

it was three oclock by the time they got back to the
ranch mr noble uncoupled the trailer in a hurry
diane had to have the car to go to the airport he called
over a couple of stable hands put that mare in the
empty corral

  the colored man gus said empty corral mr noble
aint no empty-

  that stallion corral gus

  gus climbed up the side of the trailer ats jus a little
bitty ol mare mrx noble dont you want i should put
her in a stall

  do as i say boy theres a man coming out this after-
noon to break her friend of miss dianes

  he walked up toward the house with his back very
straight hope my ears dont burn he knew the hands
were standing back there by the corral staring after him
with their mouths open how could he explain that his
daughter loved a man who rough-broke who thought it
was effeminate to start breaking and gentling a horse the
day it was foaled what did stablehands know about
daughters

  halfway to the house he was stopped by the noise of
the mowing machine hed forgotten old ranny mr
noble squinted at the sun which had not been covered by
a cloud since dawn lord

  he went to the kitchen door at a trot give me a
couple of bottles of beer and some sandwiches he barked
the housekeeper said yes mr noble just a minute
he looked around the kitchen new curtains on the win-
dows little crisp curtains with red flowers on them a
bowl of wild flowers over the flour box the copper pots
over the old fireplace had been shined within an inch
of their lives the floor sanded

  looks nice said mr noble

  the housekeeper smiled youd better not track any
mud in mr noble mrs noble and the girls have done
the whole house over for dianes beau she handed him
the sandwiches and the two cold bottles the women knew
about daughters

  there was always a horse tied in front of his office offi-
cers saddle and bags all ready he dropped the package
of food into the saddle bag and took out for the hayfields
at a lope the horse was noble belles son of aran three-
quarter bred thoroughbred mr noble took the wooden
fences in his stride steadying the beer with one hand to
keep it from being churned to foam

danny was riding the mower behind a pair of three-
year-old morgan grades that they had bred and were
finishing for an arizona cattleman whose family had bought
their stock horses from the nobles for fifty years they
liked plenty of muscle on their horses and nothing brought
it out like working in the collar

  mr noble raised his hand and ranny brought the mor-
gans around under a tree got stiffly down from his seat he
tied the grades to the tree took the bits out of their
mouths hello laird the old man said hows it
you had to be tactful with ranny the wifes got the
house so clean a man cant sit down dianes gone to get
young lochinvar come on and sit in the shade and eat
ransome ortez had the old california spanish blood in
him at seventy he walked as erect and stiff as an indian
he dropped beside mr noble took son of arans reins
you bring beer son

  yes mr noble got the beer out unhooked the caps
have a sandwich

  ranny took it speak my boy orate he said dont
mind me i was segundo on this ranch when you were a
punk at cornell college in the east i was still foreman
when you come home with a missouri gal and im still
foreman today when little dianes caught herself a man

  they call you old man noble but youre still a punk
to me youre only forty-five the look in your eye-like
a hawk with his beak in a mousetrap-is identical with the
harassed gaze of your old man when you wired youd
caught you a girl who rode saddlebreds

   bunch of junk your old man said the gal must
come of bad stock to think those are horses well the
saddlebred book is beginning to turn out some right good
stock and i havent heard any complaints about mrs
noble

  diane been talking to you mr noble asked this
michaels a rodeo rider

  well he can eat at the same table with me ranny
said finishing his beer my grandfather was one of the
best stage-coach robbers in california

  he roughbreaks horses diane made me go in and buy
a horse for him to roughbreak

  used to be a fellow over by thousand oaks who drank
hair tonic ranny said doctoring it around to improve
the taste he invented a new kind of bay rum and made a
fortune shows you that there is a wee bit of good in the
worst of us ranny had once been snowbound in the
sierras with nothing but an old almanac to read he liked
to use his quotations

  id give you the ranch laird noble said if you
werent older than i am how do you think i like the
idea of leaving the noble stock to a roughbreaker

  no more than your old man liked having a saddlebred
in the family and that turned out all right ranny said
there must be something in this rodeo riding

  mr noble nodded let the mowing go he said and
come down and look at this mare 

  ranny nodded all right you got me out of the sun
anyway my boy think you can fool me but you cant

argosy march k m
and a hickory tree



he said he unhitched the team jumped on the near horses
back

  you cant fool me either ranny you dont think
there may be something in rodeo riding and roughbreak-
ing

   there may be but i never heard of it ranny said
but diane is bred true to the line if she likes this fella
hes all right he raised the team to a smooth trot his
straight back rising and falling easily laird dont you
think its about time i quit im getting old

   well talk about it mr noble said

  ranny knew he wasnt going to work for a rough-
rider the dignity of a seventy-year-old man would be fair
game for the jokes of the sort of men there had been at
the auction sale

it was close to four by the time they got in the noble
ranch moved along according to schedule mr noble
on son of aran inspected the paddocks and fields saw
that all the stock tanks were full and clean that there were
no loose boards in the fences to cause a breakout during
the night

   there was no barbed wire on the noble ranch to give a
horse a california brand all good stock well-handled
fenced and fed for eighty years the southwest had known
that you got the best horses from nobles

   mr noble rode his fields checked on the salt blocks
estimated grass at quarter of five he was due at the barns
to see that the horses who were being finished were prop-
erly stalled with water and food and bedding

   but they werent tonight they were in their stalls but
they hadnt been tended yet at a trot mr noble took
son of aran down the wagon floor of the big barn some-
thing he had never done before he burst out of the other
end stopped his horse and heard voices over at the cor-
ral in which he had put the new mare he lifted son
of aran to a canter and went over there swung off hold-
ing his reins in his left hand

   the big silver-mounted saddle that had been his grand-
fathers was on the corral poles a tall man almost as
straight and dark as ranny was standing with a silver-
mounted bridle in his hand the hands were grouped
around the stranger and diane and ranny was sitting on
the corral top

   im laird noble dianes father mr noble said

  the stranger said im michael houston there was
a strange note in his voice a funny look iii his eyes

  diane said michaels going to break the new horse
now dad im going to call her monica for our moun-
tains

  mr noble your grandpa had a mare named monica
ranny said noble red monica she was a flycatcher
an imported stud from england outa an arabian mare
he bought up in san francisco she was nigh on four
years old fore we got her well-gaited

  youre not helping ranny mr noble snapped
why houston its all right with me go ahead i bought
the mare for you shoot the works

   michael houston said it will be dark pretty soon i
think it might be a better idea to feed her and let her get
used to her corral and in the morning-

   ranny said why son we wont think youre showing
off dianes told us you can ride anything go ahead
mr noble said you ought to take those nice clothes
off though let me loan you some overalls

   i wouldnt put you to the trouble michael houston
said my own clothes will do me nicely

   go get the overalls diane said you cant ride in
your traveling suit

   michael houston took a sack of cowboy tobacco out of
his pocket offered it around and then alone rolled a

cigarette and lit it i am not of course riding that mare
he said-

  too big for you sonny ranny asked

  too big michael houston said

  diane said but michael-

this is mans work michael said keep out of it
mr noble said no cowhand can talk to my- then
he was still were showing him up a voice said inside his
head showing him up for what he is a man whod quirt
a horse would strike a woman

  this needed to happen

  ranny said hang around mr houston hasta
manana well get us a bucking chute from town sos you
can be put on the mare while shes blindfolded well even
hire us a pickup man from one of the movie lots to take
you offn your hoss after a couple of minutes then youll
ride the mare for the lady wont you

  i am a guest on this ranch michael houston said
do i have to ride this horse to pay for my biscuits

  mr noble said mr houston allow me to show you
around it was probably just as well diane didnt have
a gun on her

  i would be honored to see the ranch before i leave
houston said in his flat slow voice

mr noble stared the man was afraid yellow it
was open and shut and yet there was the control in
his voice of a man who was at heart afraid of nothing
well mr noble thought this had been his plan but this
houston gave up too easily as though he saw through the
plan and found it contemptible

  diane said dont you feel well michael why in den-
ver you told those men out at the rodeo that you could
ride anything they had and you did too you-

  did as the romans did michael houston said but
i dont feel like riding tonight mr noble i would be
honored to be shown over your ranch i have heard a good
deal about your stock

  nobody had ever talked to diane that way before mr
nobles fists clenched then they unclenched he said
with pleasure he lifted his voice you boys gus
hod macy get that stock fed throw this mare about
ten pounds of oat hay and put water in for her come on
mr houston

  diane said im going up to the house

  ill stop in and say goodbye to you on my way
michael said

  mr nobles heart lifted he had done it it was easy
a noble knew how to defend his own he had gotten
ranny and they had whipsawed this big coloradoan and
shown him up he was driven off diane was safe to
marry someone who knew all about horses or nothing about
horses the important thing was she had been saved from
marrying a man who knew all the wrong things about
horses

  then mr noble heard himself saying my boy you
will of course stay the night

  im afraid-

  ranny said yeah hell stay the night the car just
broke down

  mr noble and ranny looked at each other but rannys
spanish blood was in his eyes you couldnt read a thing
mr noble took michael for a tour of the place

it was growing on mr noble that while this boy didnt
know an awful lot about blooded stock he knew what
questions to ask the boy would make  

  mr noble could have made a mistake he could have
cost diane a man she loved and a good man but there
were plenty of good men around no use starting off with
one who had two strikes against him


argosy

  what are you doing out here in california mr noble
asked come out to ride in the rodeos

  if i have to michael said i hoped to stay here
now i dont know colonel meyer in colorado springs
sent me out here on the plane to pick up a half-dozen polo
ponies for him with the commission hes paying me and
the money ive gotten together i thought maybe id buy
me a little california ranch now im not so sure

  no dont you care for our climate

  thats a joke i dont feel like laughing mr noble
im afraid ive put myself in a pretty bad position you
know i asked diane to marry me

  mr noble said i gathered as much

  it never occurred to me said michael houston that
her folks would think i was trying to marry into the
noble ranch all my life ive heard about the noble
ranch

  when i was fourteen i was cookie on a ranch down
in south park the owner used to ride over on a noble
horse all the hands were always going to save up their
money and get themselves one but you know how cow-
boys are they got along with what they could catch and
break themselves

  yes but some new thoughts were creeping through
mr nobles head it had taken courage to make that
speech mr noble doubted whether he could have made
it himself

  ive got a thousand dollars saved up i can get me a
few acres a few tons of hay a few cheap horses to rough-
break michael said

  his voice was quietly deferential the anger and hurt in
it were carefully kept down but mr noble could tell they
were there maybe diane wouldnt live as well there as
she has at home michael went on but shed eat im a
good roughrider next year i could maybe buy one or two
yearlings from you or the kellog ranch for proper train-
ing but-i wouldnt have any part of your noble ranch
the houston outfitll put you in the shade

  mr noble said you can always learn something   
maybe ive been wrong you werent scared to ride that
mare were you son

  ill go now mr noble and thanks for showing me your
ranch you got a right pretty layout

  wait a minute son rannys skulking around some
place mr noble lifted his voice and screamed rannyl 

the old man dropped out of no place one minute he
wasnt there the next minute he was standing quietly
in the dusk yeah

  ranny youve been on this place over fifty years
  considerable

  tell mr houston how many times youve heard a
noble apologize to anyone 

  ransome ortez said son that just dont happen you
wanted something laird

  a witness mr noble said michael i judged you
before i met you i was wrong you are all right michael
and will you now please tell me why you wouldnt ride
that mare

  michael houston stared a moment it was getting pretty
dark well ill be damned you dont know you
laird noble of- why lord man since i was a boy i
always thought nobody could tell a noble about a horse

  why sir you cant roughbreak a high-blooded horse
like that youd either kill her or kill yourself rough-
breakings for scrubs and broncs cheap horses for men who
cant afford to pay more than twenty thirty dollars for a 
mount

  youve got to be gentle with a good big horse like that
black morgan any man who knew enough to even get
on her wouldnt have the heart to punish her spirit with
the spurs and the quirt you-

  you mean you cant roughbreak good horses

  of course not theres cowhands who do i suppose
when theyre long yearlings or short two-year-olds but
not a grown mare roughbreakings how i make my liv-
ing its how i mean to get the money to get some good
stock its-

  ranny mr noble said i think i just learned some-
thing

  ranny spat you better learn something else im quit-
ting get yourself a new segundo

  i got one if hell take the job

  if you mean me michael houston said youve hired
a coloradoan i would certainly admire to learn about
good horses from you mr noble

  quit soft soaping the boss ranny drawled save it
for his daughter

  its an idea michael said and loped toward the
house

  the two men stood there a while looking after him in
the barns a horse whickered and the new mare answered
nice mare you bought today ranny said

  diane picked her i guess shes a pretty good judge of
horseflesh ranny blood will out you-

  me said ranny i would walk soft and talk gentle
for a while if i was you 

  dont forget youre talking to your boss ranny
you- then mr noble grinned in the dark id be
honored to do so he said in fair imitation of a rocky
mountain drawl you coming up to the house for dinner
tonight ranny theres likely to be doings

short voyage home

  by richard sale

 author of launch torpedots design for valor etc

before the germans gun the english
pilot yanked out the bilge plug

the exceptional story of two men who fell out of the sky-to meet again
in strange conflict

ross went down first he had been sparring with
the german plane each of them trying to find an
opening and neither one succeeding the fight
between the two of them hurricane and messerschmitt
had been going on for ten minutes ross knew he had a
bearcat because he had seen the black markers on the
jerrys fin each marker meant a victory

  but when he lost a wing ross knew the jerry hadnt
done it not the chap in the other plane you seldom
saw the man who got you for hurricanes are blind astern
but he was pretty sure hed been caught by anti-aircraft
probably from gris nez

  anyway he went down he bailed out safely enough
and the parachute functioned perfectly there was no
sensation of motion after that he looked up and was
stunned the anti-aircraft fire had caught the german
plane too the jerry had been shot down by his own army

  ross watched fascinated as the port engine of the
messerschmitt burned he saw the jerry go over the side
bailing out too saw the parachute blossom as his own
had they went down he had a lead on the german of
about half a mile

  he forgot his former adversary and regarded the sea
below here was an insoluble problem the descent was
safe enough he had bailed out of a wrecked fighter with
impunity and no one had fired upon him as his para-
chute came down he was almost mid-channel between
calais and dover everything was just fine except that he
was going to drown

  he felt in his pocket and found a cigarette and managed

 to light it with his storm-lighter he smoked the cigarette
slowly his young face grave as he examined the water
below it was flecked with white-horse water here and
there and it looked gray and ugly

   the wind was northeast and it rolled up the combers
 briskly there were no briitsh crash boats in sight though
 they sometimes came out to rescue pilots pilots were
 valuable but no boat appeared and of course no ger-
 man boat dared poke its nose off the french coast

   it was a very ironical thing to live through being shot
 down only to drown in an english sea

   ross smoked and regarded the german pilot who hung
 in the sky above him that poor chap with all his vic-
 tories marked on his fin he too was in a bit of a spot
 plane wrecked by his own compatriots ack-ack he was
 destined for the sea too ross forgot they had been fight-
 ing and worried about the jerry pilot a little

   at one thousand feet he began to examine the sea thor-
 oughly from pure habit as if looking for the best spot
 to drop himself down this was a little ridiculous but it
 was an instinctive gesture to his sudden amazement he
 saw a boat it was not a crash boat indeed the word boat
 was perhaps too flattering it was a small three-place
 dory adrift in mid-channel it was a paint-flecked grimy
 little gray thing terribly small and terribly alone

   it was empty there was a single oar lying in the bot-
 tom of the boat one oarlock was smashed and the star-
 board side of the gunwale was splintered as if from a burst
 of shrapnel

   ross wondered how the devil the thing could have been

s


argosy

floating there so providentially not possibly a left-over
from the thousands of boats that figured at dunkirk this
was long past dunkirk just a dory no doubt that had
torn loose and drifted out to sea or a dory from some
abandoned freighter

   anyway there was a boat he spilled air from his chute
to guide himself toward it it was not quite under him
he saw that he was going to make it beautifully he
spilled air again dropping much faster so that he would
not pass beyond it by the time he came down

   it took skill but ross was skillful at three hundred
feet he began to worry that he might put both his boots
right through its bottom but he was not this good he
overshot it by fifteen feet and went into the icy water with
a tremendous splash

it seemed as if he must have sunk to the very bottom
of the channel before his life belt had any effect at all
the belt finally made itself known and slowly raised the
bulk of him and his flying clothes to the surface he found
his head clear of the chute and he paddled very amateur-
ishly until he reached the dory

   encumbered he could not climb into the dory he cut
himself loose from the chute and the life preserver and
then got out of his flying clothes and climbed up over the
bow intothe boat after this he attempted to regain the
life preserver for future use but it had floated off beyond
his reach he watched it go disconsolately

   ross took the oar not seeming to feel the cold and he
looked up for the jerry there he was spilling air too
in order to come down close to the dory the jerry did
not have a life preserver on he was also going to fall short
he had seen the boat too late

   he waved cheerfully and ross waved back ross took
the single oar and began to scull toward the spot where
he expected the german to plunge in he waved toward the
spot and the german nodded

   they did well the german splashed in just before the
bow of the boat reached there the german came up once
blubbering ross grabbed him by the collar and cut the
chute straps from him then helping him into the boat it
was all over within a minute they both sat down on the
thwarts drenched feeling the cold now and they both
panted for their breath the dory tossed heavily in the
seas but did not take any water

   danke the jerry said finally still gasping

   ross said im sorry  dont speak it

   of course said the jerry pardon me i should have
addressed you in english since i speak it thank you
very much for helping me it was a very close call nicht
wahr i caught my life preserver in my safety belt up-
stairs and i had to get rid of it it was very good of you
to reach me so quick eh

   he was a little older than ross and gray at the tem-
ples his face was not unkind his eyes were tired he
had a faint smile on his mouth my name is flirgen
mine is ross ross said we both ran into a little
bad luck up there your ack-ack batteries on the coast got
me

   me too the fools said flirgen without malice did
you ever hear of anything so stupid as firing upon a dog-
fight when we move so fast how are they to tell which
of us they will hit

   it really wasnt a good idea ross said at the same
time through good luck weve both managed to live

through-it that might not have happened otherwise
yes you are right flirgen said he smiled coldly
you were doing very well ross very well indeed com-
ing from me that is a high compliment i do not mean
to be egostical mind you that is not on my mind but
i have flown for a long time and i have shot down many
machines you saw my fin doubtless with the markers
forty-two of them so when i say you fly well believe
me

   forty-two said ross hovering between hate of the
idea and admiration of the record

   oh yes said flirgen believe me ross that is true
those were confirmed but not all british my word no
seven british twelve are spanish i flew with the con-
dor in spain i flew against poland belgium france
only seven british and they have been very difficult
and you

   five confirmed said ross but i have only been
flying for two months

flirgen looked thoughtful look here my friend it
occurs to me that we should not discuss the business of
killing in the air it is a machine against a machine one
does not like to think that there is a man to die in each
machine you understand me	

   i find the thought that you have shot down five un-
comfortable and then i wonder how you feel when when
i say forty-two face to face in this manner it is un-
pleasant one thinks in the air of shooting down machines
face to face we find we have been men out to kill each
other it is not nice

   i think you are right ross said relieved he smiled
faintly at the german youre an excellent flyer your-
self i couldnt get inside you he began to scull with the
oar pointing the bow of the boat toward the white cliffs
of dover where they rose faintly and remote against the
background of the flecked and angry channel the wind
had a bite through the wet clothes

   a moment said pilot flirgen

   ross stopped sculling a moment and glanced at the
pilot flirgens face was filled with indecision and mild
dismay but it was not yet unfriendly the dory continued
its weigh for a moment and then fell off with the seas and
rolled heavily once more

   what is it ross said

   it appears to me said flirgen gently that we still
have a problem here ross it has changed somewhat be-
cause we are no longer in the air but upstairs you and
i met in our planes and intended that one of us should
go home and the other not

   well flirgen

   which way do you head us my friend

   ross face was like stone to dover flirgen to eng-
land

   but i would prefer ross to head this boat for calais
for occupied france

   they faced each other staring at each other ross said
but this is my boat flirgen by law of the sea and sal-
vage i was the first to reach it and take command of it and
it is under my command

   please dont be british said flirgen with a faint cool
smile to be british is to be stuffy you are being stuffy
obviously you reached the boat and possibly it is yours
but still i have no wish to go to england and be interned
its rather a disgraceful fate for an ace
short voyage home



  most german pilots are glad to reach england alive
said ross they are well fed and well treated and they
do not have to fly again they become philosophers even
the young ones

  doubtless said flirgen dryly at the same time i am
a soldier and not a coward and i wish to fly again for
my fatherland it might be different if you had defeated
me in air combat but you have not ross and who is to
say that you might have lost the game entirely i wish
to go to france

  and i said ross evenly to england

  there was a long and ugly silence as they faced each
other then flirgen said come now we are enemies
again let us forgetthe war for a moment and behave
as civilized man we can afford to be civilized now we
cant both get away so let us toss a coin for it i have
one on me

  i never gamble said ross id prefer not

  that is true said flirgen amused you english-
men do not gamble well then suppose you suggest some-
thing

  i suggest we go to england i intend to it is my boat
he coughed deprecatingly after all old man i didnt
have to scull under you when you dropped into the sea-
flirgen looked annoyed for the first time i resent
your tone ross i fully appreciate your saving my life
it was a gallant thing to do but only what one gentleman
would expect of another now it is a different thing i
dont see why i should be interned when you failed to
defeat me in battle i dont see why i should be interned
on a technicality

  but since you-did not defeat me either-

  true but it was a question of nerve ross as to whose
nerve would break first we were both in a tight circle
and one of us would have had to fly out of it when his
nerve broke yours would have broken first i do not
mean to insult you by saying this but after all i have
downed forty-two planes and flown in three phases of war-
fare mine would not have broken

  this is my boat ross said his eyes flinty and this
is my sea a british sea

  there is an argument about that between our coun-
tries it is also a stuffy remark no offense ross but it
settles nothing

  this cant be settled said ross not if you intend to
go to france for i fully intend to reach england he
began to scull again his eyes on the german you can
slop me by a hand-to-hand fight in this boat if you wish

ttvlirgen studied him a moment i will guarantee
you safe conduct in france and attempt to persuade
my commanding officer to return you to your home air-
port

  thank you ross smiled i have full confidence in
your honor flirgen but not in your countrys

  in that case flirgen said wearily you leave me no
alternative we are at war again and it seems a pity
he reached into his flying suit and brought out a pistol
which he aimed at ross stomach im very sorry to be so
ugly ross but you are a prisoner of war and i order you
to turn the boat around and scull toward france

  ross looked at the gun he thought its been in the
sea but itll work just the same he said and if i re-
fuse

  i will have to shoot you and go alone said flirgen
for gods sake man be sensible i like you i dont
want to kill you any more than you want to kill me
ross stopped sculling and sat down on the stern thwart
he felt a little empty and cold he shivered at the bite
of the wind then you will be just as unfair in that you
havent defeated me either and yet i arft a prisoner
what else can i do and i firmly believe your nerve
ross would have broken first i have been fighting so
much longer flirgen lowered the gun slightly come
come my friend there is nothing else to do luck is with
me that i still have a weapon you have only nerve left
and here it is no good to you scull for calais

  ross stared at the bilge then he reached down slowly
and grabbed hold of a plug and yanked it out of the
bilge a finger of water stood up in the bottom of the
boat and the black slime in the bilge instantly began to
gain in depth

  pilot flirgen did not understand for a moment what
had happened he had seen ross move but the bilge plug
was so small he hardly made it out in ross hand he
frowned at the finger of water suddenly opened his eyes
wide as he took cognizance of its meaning and then shout-
ed ross put it back put back that plug

  ross eyes were faraway focusing on the great white
cliffs across the wind-whipped seas his chests taut and
smooth as he held his jaw firm no he said harshly
throw away your pistol flirgen we are going to eng-
land or we are going to drown both of us shooting will
do no good ill throw this plug overboard before you can
reach me my hand is over the side it will drop when
your bullet strikes me

  but the water is filling usl flirgen cried lieber
gott ross it will be too late put back the plug he
turned quickly and threw the gun into the air it splashed
into the sea and sank from sight there there ross only
put back the plug it will be too late in the name of
god-

  ross saw the gun go he bent forward slowly and put
the plug back into the bottom of the hull forcing the
finger of sea down into the hole until it vanished com-
pletely he stamped on the plug with his heel to set it
then he returned to his thwart and took up the oar he
sculled it was a long time before his face relaxed

  flirgen he said bail out the bilge use your boot
get the water out of the bottom we will make better
time

  to england said flirgen gloomily you didnt win
fairly ross i should still fight you but i will be a
philosopher but it was not fair it was as unfair as my
gun he glanced up shrugging

  ross shrugged too was it a question of nerve flir-
gen you spoke of nerve before

  it was not a question of nerve flirgen said sadly
or maybe it was but i have always looked with horror
upon drowning it was most unfair you see i cannot
swim did you knowthat or did you just gamble
do englishmen ever gamble ross said you told me
yourself that the british do not know how to gamble
that is correct

  i did not gamble said ross quietly it was no gam-
ble flirgen i have always looked with horror upon
drowning too you see i cannot swim either so it was fair
enough

chapter xxxi

army of forgotten men

two horsemen rode up wampum street the night
was cooled by a small wind out of the north and muted
thunder was mumbling its first false bravado below the
rim of the lowering sky greater winds would blow and
thunderbolts would rock the roof before the night was
done

but where we goin swifty said

i dont know swifty somewheres-anywheres i
got to move

we could just as well ride wrong as right said swifty
lets stop an see how bearpaws cornin on hes an old
man cass and he was hit a heavy blow mebbe he can
talk a little better now there might be more that he
could tell

ride herd on me swifty cass said slowly dont
let me make myself a fool its mainly this feelin that
just wont stay downed i got to find her



     shand had jumped sidewise slapping at his thigh
dr farabaugh stood tall beside the table and his quick
glance went to the cupped candle the tiny tongue of flame

  ill shoot if you move mary ellen cried

  the drug had dilated her pupils hazing her vision giv-
ing her a wild black glare but her voice was sharp with
purpose and she backed it with a steadfast gun

  stand steady ollie the doctor said softly shes
sick-she doesnt know what shes doing cant you see
whats in her eyes

  perhaps he believed it he spoke in his gentle doctors
voice so soothing and he looked at her without alarm he
was using the professional poise that calmed his violent
patients he would not risk a sudden move his easy
words would distract her disarm her

  so she knew

  its to save a scandal ollie he said that i tried to
get her away you know the strain shes been under i
kept her at my own home hoping my treatments could
prevent- he moved his hand slowly gesturing i
didnt realize she might break suddenly i couldnt believe
her rage might be turned-on ada- 

  his lies the desperate lies he had woven in his vigils
of fear speaking them now with a double tongue to
confuse ollie shand and to decoy her into some move of
error or to test her perhaps to measure the extent
of her recovery

  if the truth came out he said i dont know what
might have happened in triangle that town is lynch-
crazy boy stand your distance there and let me handle
her her minds a blank shes thrown off the morphia
just enough to make her dangerous but she wont harm

gentry led his strange posse into that wild
jamboree

s

the first installment of this seven-part serial herein concluded
appeared in the argosy for february 
gunswift



 me shes learned to trust me havent you mary ellen
 and he said put it down drop your arm my dear
 no one will injure you his bearded lips smiled and he
 made a step toward her

   stand back she breathed ill shoot-

    oh no he said and he lifted his hand reaching it out
 to her give it to me mary ellen let the doctor take
 care of it for you my dear

   he came another smiling step and his hand was reach-
 ing and she read in his face the victory he was winning
 he thought he had mastered her poor drugged brain an-
 other slow step and then his pounce his quick hand
 slapping-

   no she screamed no

   he was in mid-step when she pulled the trigger the
 sound of explosion was dull in her ears a puff a plop a
 midget force to halt so huge a man yet it straightened
 him like a lifting blow it jolted the length of his body
 and transformed his face his stretching hand jerked up-
 ward snatching at air and abruptly he began to sag she
 closed her eyes as he melted melted down

 ollie shand stood rigid she turned to him shift-
 ing the revolver barrel and his face was frozen a
 young face a sensible homely face

   he drugged me mary ellen said ghost-voiced i
 am not crazy i didnt kill his wife

    look out with that gun said ollie shand

    i only want to get away she said i want to get to
 triangle i cant go back to sleep i-weve got to warn
 abel bannister

   he watched her they looked at each othef while
 seconds passed the body yin the floor did not exist for
 them

   youve got to believe me she said i heard what
 you said i know how you feel go on-ride now-warn
 bannister

   he shook his head theyd shoot me down without a
 word but ill show you the trail ill ride with you if
 you say so

    i couldnt she said breathlessly i couldnt sit the
 saddle i can barely hold- and the gun slumped with
 her hand it clattered to the floor and ollie shand made
 no move for it

    the sleep the gray lethargy was flowing her body again
 that flame of salvation in her mind was waning guttering
 like the candle in its cup

   help me she begged lift me up-make me stand-
 let me fight it

   but even with his arm supporting her even when she
 stood outside with her hand clinging to his shoulder the
 strength would not come again she was dizzy and the
 darkness reeled

   the buggy she said put me into it you cant
wait for me youve got to ride how soon can you get to
triangle town cass gentry-tell him hes the man to
 stop it can you reach him in time ollie shand

   it all depends he said it depends on how early
 bannister started and how straight red helwigs leadin
 em all i can do is whatever

   ollie shand would think later of the curious under-
 standing with which they had spoken mchales daughter
 and mile shands son facing each other with death be-
 tween them stranger looking at stranger and yet no
 questions to be asked

   the only explanation ollie had for it was something-
 some sly glint-he had seen in doc farabaughs eye it
 had told ollie that the doc was fixing to jump him he
 had known he would have to use his gun on that big wild
 bear and sometimes he wondered if he would have shot as
 lucky if his bullet would have traveled as straight to the

 heart as hers did he couldnt be at all sure about that

hooves ran a deepening tattoo into the quiet of wam-
pum street-a lone horseman cutting the wind he
checked his headlong pace as he neared the wheel of for-
tune and his shadowy figure straightened in the saddle
his revolver pointed into the night loosing three ex-
plosions

   he lifted his voice as the echoes racketed gentry
he shouted cass gentry

  heads popped from the doorways nearby but none
jumped into view as rapidly as did the summoned man
cass had been sitting on the steps of the hardware shop
counting his thumbs and he called an instant answer he
came on the double-quick with swifty at his elbow

   the signal-shooting rider climbed down and posted him-
self so that the rim of light from venables biggest window
disclosed his features the stubble had been shaved from
his chin but cass recognized ollie shand

  a lady sent me gentry he said you an me have
got to ride or triangle town will count widows by
mornin	m

   cass tried to yell six questions at once spluttering
shes all tight said ollie shand lissen dammit
bannisters in bad trouble they got a deadfall set-
cass listened without a single drop of redeye pain-
cure under his belt he grew to twice his size in thirty
seconds just knowing she was safe just knowing mary
ellen was secure and that she had sent word to him

   it didnt matter where she was or why or how she got
there nor did he think it curious at the time that her
message came from ollie shand all he cared about was
the sudden shift of weights inside which told him that the
world was right again

   bannister cattail cut  rifles hidden and boulders
set to roll   red helwig   mary ellen  stop em

   now lissen close said ollie shand i know a crow-
fly way that cuts ten miles from the distance thatbannister
traveled by road its rough and tough on horseflesh but
it gets you there if we can make the ride in time startin
now im damned if i know

   i figger bannister wasted some hours pickin up the
parties from the valleys ranches hell likely mosey on-
ward slow and quiet on the other hand he may be there
by now with his saddle shot from under im

  bring up our horses swifty said cass i knew
wed need em

   how bannister can be stopped right now said shand
a better brain than mine will have to puzzle if this was
a few hours earlier we might cut into his trail before he
hit the big malpais tryin to head im now though would
be huntin a flea in a haystack

   best we can do as i see it is head straight for the
cut and take our chances if we beat im there-well we
can raise some rumpus mebbe and spoil the setup with-
out too many killed if we dont beat im-

   he shook his head of course if we counted fifteen
men stead of three we might be able-

  what do you mean cass demanded and ollie told
him he explained the layout of cattail cut and the
country behind it and how a bunch of men might injun
in beyond

   wait a minute cass muttered

   but i hear said ollie that there aint a able man
or decent horse left here in triangle

   cass looked at him ill be back directly

tte went into the wheel of fortune and the man at
-- the end of the bar stared at the whip-whap sound of
the doors that fluttered behind him why hadnt the
sound of shots outside brought em running he went


argosy

striding back seeking a certain face he had noticed before
hop randolph almost as if he had been expecting the
visit stepped apart from the others

   in the slight gap of hesitation before cass spoke a queer
consideration flashed across his mind here were the men
that a woman-killer had feared to face not afraid of
what they might do but of the contempt he would see in
their eyes they were the looking-glasses in which a
carson city gambler had seen his own weakness into
which cass gentry had projected his doubts of himself

  but why should any man care a damn what a hundred
happy hours thought what a thousand wheels of fortune
said if he knew the truth inside himself what did repu-
tations matter

  reputations were for men who had nothing else to value
the only real repute was what a man believed of himself
it had taken a long time to pound the lesson home but
cass knew the truth of it now tonight and that other
night had given him something stronger than pride to
balance him

  you men locked in here he asked

  you might say so yes said randolph were in
your class gentry we aint quite good enough to be in-
vited to go out and get shot nor to drink wine at the
celebration frank irish is holdin up on the hill

  the vigilantes passed out word that the streets would
be watched tonight and that men seen roamin loose would
be called on to explain their business with the judge
lynch talk thats gone around a mans a fool to take
chances

  bannister and his crowd are headed into ambuscade
cass said harshly i need as many men as can be
gathered on a longshot chance of springin em free it
means a rough ride and bullets in your hair it calls for
men who can sit a horse and shoot a gun and dont prize
their skin too highly how many such can i mount in
the next ten minutes

  silence and then a growl of sound

  youll have to take my word for the truth of it cass
said and the only way i know its true is that ollie shand
told me would any of you gents choose to ride on such
a job behind a rustler and a woman-killer

  the growl grew to a roar shouting men pushed forward
to answer him

chapter xxxii

into the valley of death

the rescue party rode out fifteen strong with twelve
picked hands selected from thirty volunteers some
of them sat their kaks with the unease of riders needing
practice some of them lacked boots and spurs a few were
slightly tipsy they were variously armed and mounted
and variously garbed but they carried their weapons like
men prepared to use them

  swart-faced men and pale-faced men men in gamblers
finery and in stablehands dungarees they had in common
a certain look of warlike capability

  they followed ollie shand orphans of the dark through
a night that groaned out thunder they veered against a
wind that held the cold threat of rain they followed ollie
shand into hell some of them must have thought before
the ride was ended

  ollie led them by forgotten trails and trails that never
were he led them at a pace that was dangerous in the dark
smelling his way along it seemed by animal instinct and
if they thought the going was tough in the early miles they
learned what tough could be when they hit the badlands

  enough light seeped through the overcast to show the
hazy contours of the country they traveled but there was

no great extent of visibility they saw timber stands as
looming walls and gullies as gouges of deeper shadow

  they rode through ten-foot defiles bending to escape
the brush that switched their faces they galloped mesa
stretches as level as a faro board and skidded down cut-
bank slopes in rivulets of shale and a fog of dust and a
mutter of curses they splashed over watercourses and
along them

  time and again they came to seeming dead-end impasses
they would charge at a barrier stretch of bosque darkly
impenetrable and in the very shadow of it ollie shand
would swing right or left into an opening they filed
through brush-and-boulder ravines that narrowed to
cramping slits but always there was a miraculous exit at
the end of them they drove straight at drop-offs and
only ollie shands eyes or his instinct could see the cut-
offs that led to safety

  mixed country it was called hells hundred miles-
so it had been named in the days that some of the riders
could remember the days when the war-feather sioux kept
their tomtoms humming along about the third breather-
stop several of the possemen would have sworn they had
already traveled a thousand miles of that desolate hundred

  the route they followed would have been a risky one
by daylight traveling at quarter-speed and ollie shand
could claim all the credit for the feat that brought them to
a halt this side of midnight with no more than two of the
troop forced out along the way a horse pulled up lame
in the midway stretch and somewhere one of the drag-
riders lost himself which tallied them as thirteen strong
when ollie signaled the last dismount

  thirteen-the bakers dozen the unluckiest number

   either the war is over ollie said or it aint started
yet he pointed cattail cut lies yonder we stand
some half a mile behind er from here we lead the horses

  we move as careful as we can im countin that ax-
tons bunch will figger any noise we make as cornin from
men of their own they dont expect no strangers to have
swung in at the rear

  cigarettes glowed in the gloom where they waited it
would be the last smoke for some of them a bottle passed
from hand to hand a few whispers traveled but mostly
the men stood silent hop randolph and swifty moved
among them checking the cartridge supply and ollie
shands plan of campaign was quickly outlined

cass gentry went on with ollie ahead of the others
the storm was still delaying fuming behind the clouds
but now there were riffles of lightning shot through thunder
groans and a sprinkle of rain swept down on an occasional
blow of wind

  let it blow let it rain let the sky bust loose cass
thought it would be a fitting background for this show-
down deal

   for this was the fag-tail flutter of the cards the bottom
chip tossed into the jackpot of triangles mystery the
outline of what had happened starting with the death of
matthew mchale had been shaped in truth tonight the
answers to the most important questions were neatly laid
out in cass gentrys mind

  the brain of the conspiracy was in triangle town but
the fist of it was clenched over cattail cut if this blow
could be parried its force destroyed cass gentrys job of
work would be almost done even such a jugheaid as abel
bannister would be forced to see the reality and to act
upon it that is if bannister was one of the lucky ones
who didnt stop a slug somewhere in the shooting

   heres where well start from said ollie shand softly
the mouth of this little wash opens on a slope its good
clear ground all the way down to their barricade lets
snake up this ridge and ill show you
gunswift



   cass stretched on his belly and scouted the dim layout
below with shands whispered words in his ear he could
visualize the terrain of action cattail cut ran east and
west a brush-sided rock-studded gorge that knifed more
than a hundred yards of passage through ridges of timber
and tangle

   the gorge narrowed to a thirty-foot width at the west-
ward notch an opening which could be marked as the
lightning flickered the gorge spilled into a saucer plateau
and it was on the rim of this that cass and ollie were
posted

   you cant make er out very plain right now ollie
murmured but i watched em pile the rocks and logs
that block the passage when bannisters bunch gets well
inside the east end them boys on the slopes will crack
down boulders will roll and rifle fire will bite down on the
drag

   they wont be able to stand still and i doubt if ban-
nisters got the brains to turn back the way he come hell
likely come bustin on ahead buckin spang into the bar-
ricade and the rifles behind it i expect axton will have his
main force there and you can figger yourself how many
will go down with fifteen or twenty men shootin point-
blank into the pile-up

   and i think i know the reason for this little caper
cass said this is the blow-off of the burnt mills boys
shoot and run is all theyll aim to do they expect to send
abel bannister limpin home with dead across the saddles
which will cool any more vigilante notions

   if wed been sure that bannister would poke along so
slow said shand we might have headed im on the
other side we got no choice though now lets get on
back to the wash i might scout a little closer and see what
i can find before i head on frontwards two quick shots
then three-thatll be the signal the rest is up to you
gentry

swifty and hop randolph had brought the others up
to the lee of a wooded stand near the wash there was
no smoking now and even the whispers were lacking the
faces seen in the shutters of lightning that flashed at long
intervals were grave hard-cast

   these men were gamblers most of them but they were
gambling in a different game tonight the stakes were
higher than silver and greenbacks and they stood to lose
more than they could gain yet they had no complaints
no questions no hesitations

   cass knew how they felt hop randolph told the story
with that expression of his not good enough to be invited
to go out and get shot they were counted as the buzzards
of triangle town-and they were no better than they pro-
fessed to be but this was their way of telling which side
of the river they wanted to ride on

   ollie shand tossed a rock into the branches a little later
-warning his approach-and ghosted from the shadows
to deliver his scouting report

   i practically crawled right in amongst em he said
it was axton himself that i heard talk them devils even
had a man or two ridin with bannisters bunch who cut
out ahead to carry word

   the vigilantes are kickin over the traces which is
what slowed em down some claimed the storm would
wash their chances out and they should choose another
night more than a few headed back for their homes but
bannisters pushin on with the rest hell or high water
they expect im at the cut right shortly

   what plans they got said cass

   same as i called the turn on from what i could hear
bannisters even made it easy to know who to shoot at
hes got his vigilantes wearin white cloth strips on their
hats so they wont mistake each other well so long gents

good luck ill shoot the news when bannisters inside
two and three-thats my signal

   the minutes dragged on swifty ogdens suggestion a
gambler stripped off his expensive silk shirt and strips of
the white fabric were used as hatband decorations men
checked their guns again and counted the cartridges in
their pockets they stood beside their horses and when
the signal came they needed no order to mount

  two quick reports then three-and the summons of
those distant gunblasts was a louder sound to the men
beyond the wash than all the nights thunder

  an answering fusillade boomed out before the echoes
faded

chapter xxxiii

midnight fortune

pistol-flash and rifle-roar stabbing the shadows
racketing the walls of cattail cut pounding a hula-
baloo into the stormy midnight eager men waiting in
ambush who tugged their triggers and bellowed their shouts
and sent the great stones toppling from the upper ridges
with a rumble and a crash and a sliding clatter trailing
after

   startled men hemmed in the gloom of frowning steeps
suspicious men crowded in confusion who turned their
faces up to a sudden assault of spanging lead and avalanche
who reined at skittering mounts and grabbed their weapons
fast and loosed them off at everything and nothing

   it was a midnight of surprises for many men but the
two whowere stricken with greatest shock were abel ban-
nister the bull for whom the ambush had been planned
and preacher axton the fox who had planned it

   the snaketrack boss rode in the van of his vigilantes
as a leader should and he was a grim-jawed harried sul-
phurous leader long before he headed into the cattail maw

   delays and bad trails and bickerings fools who forgot
their orders and yellow-bellied skunks who shied at a drop
of rain how many weeks had he planned this raid how
many miles had he pounded the roads to gather his men
how much of his time and money had he poured down
this rathole

  the worries he wouldnt admit sat heavy behind his
saddle maybe they should be raiding by daylight as some
seemed to think maybe a brighter night would be better
or a wipe-out charge timed with the dawn

   it might pour rain and bog them all at that it might
be better to split in smaller parties to lay a siege on the
pocket to scatter the fight in guerilla style maybe ollie
shand did expect they were coming and he might well have
a deadfall set maybe this damn red helwig was as lost
as any the rest of em

   so he was thinking nosing ahead into the quiet of the
cut with his force dwindled to the fifty-odd who tagged
behind such were his worries when a pistol cracked from
nowhere and the skies fell down

   abel bannister blared out a rallying cry as rocks tumbled
upon the rear files and rifles winked along the slopes above
any fool could see there were less than a dozen guns turned
on them and any idiot should have known that the attack
was intended to stampede

   impossible to storm the slopes of course no sense in
chasing back toward the entrance mouth and if that
rabbit-livered rabble had had the brains to hark to him if
theyd held their heads and hugged the walls for cover
there neednt have been a breakneck jamboree

   but even his great voice could not avail against the
babel that they raised grown men picked men fighting
men-yet thirty seconds changed them into a run of
boogered cattle they shot off their guns horses reared


argosy

and an unlucky bullet from above caught one man in the
neck and started him screaming a horse went down as
more rocks clattered and suddenly there was a mass
surge that pushed abel bannister ahead of it

  crouching riders sped past him and his own strong-jawed
trail-horse caught the epidemic jammed and jostled the
snaketrack boss was swept along by the tide that sought
the straightest exit out of cattail cut

  pellmell vigilante hooves charging the hidden barricade
ahead

and preacher axton also had a little surprise in store
for him the hound-faced storekeeper of burnt mills
had laid his plans carefully he had weighed every angle
of them checking every possibility there was a thousand-
dollar bonus for the preacher in this little stunt vic
barth had promised if everything came out all right an-
other thousand to put on top of the good wage-money
preach axton had been hoarding

  he considered that thousand as good as in his pocket
when a guarded wink of light from the ridge announced
that bannister was stepping into the spiders parlor the
ten men along the heights knew what they were supposed
to do and axton had posted himself at the barricade with
the other sixteen to see that no hitch developed on the
business end of the proceedings

  it wasnt exactly a slaughter that was wanted vic
barth had explained just enough to throw the fear of
god into em axton had arranged therefore to give them
three doses of the soothing syrup put up by dr colt and
dr winchester

  the opener would be with rifles-pumpinglnto the mass
as they came and shooting mainly to stop the rush to down
the front push of horses after that each of his sixteen
would empty two revolvers into the tangle then they
would grab their getaway mounts and skeedaddle-another
day another dollar

  preach axton stood behind his crouching men and the
faint noises of the coming vigilantes were money-music in
his ear there was one second at the start-some dumb
fool must have triggered his pistol beforehand firing five
shots-when his doubts rose up but then the high rifles
began to crack the rocks started rumbling and from the
yells of the vigilantes and the burst of wild fire they loosed
he knew they were on the run

  he could hear them coming-closer closer-and then
the surprise turned up preach axton thought for a second
that cattail cut had turned itself around in the dark for
suddenly horsemen were charging them from behind from
the wrong direction

  they were coming in both directions and the fat was in
the fire



the misfit posse that followed cass gentry was midway
down the curve of the saucer before the main artillery
began to bang the twelve riders were spaced out wide
and for the first twenty jumps they held their tongues and
their fire

  a wild bullet slapped over their heads one of axtons
riflemen jerking around in panic discharged his weapon
among the horses held ready for escape some of the
others bewildered by converging sounds shot prematurely
up the gorge a few more were turning their muzzles
upon the new enemy when cass gentrys pistol whacked
out a blast that eleven others echoed

  the twelve came fast and came a-shooting hand-guns
were their weapons two apiece with the second held in
reserve for the mop-up work at close quarters they
charged into a hasty fire from the ambushers that emptied

two saddles but four of axtons men were on the ground
when the rescue posse hit the level of the last ten yards
by then the night was a pandemonium of voices and hooves
and explosions

   swifty ogden and the shirtless gambler riding the left
flank attended to the string of horses that two men tried
to control shooting among them scattering them cass
and the others drove straight at the blockade lotm aiming
at the flashes of explosion at any scurrying figure it was
horseman versus man on foot and the horsemen had the
speed the jump the better guns sixty seconds of leaden
hail decided the skirmish

   abruptly axtons bushwhackers were fleeing the attack
two or three lifted their arms in surrender and at least one
man a staggering fellow with a bullet in his foot was
pinned beneath the barricade fence when bannisters riot
of cavalry crashed into it

   for the vigilante flight had been unstoppable the walls
of the gorge distorting the gunblast echoes their own
shouts the blind impulse to seek the fastest and straightest
way to safety-all these panic complications crowded them
on into the narrowing bottleneck

   when the men in front were close enough to recognize
the immediate danger ahead when they tried to pull up
to avoid the unknown turmoil that had no shape or mean-
ing in the bottom gloom they found the trail too narrow
and the push from behind too headlong

   the pack of horseflesh rammed a fortification of logs
and branches and some of the riders who went down in
the first big thrashing spill did not get up again sheer
weight and pressure collapsed the barrier and the ears of
triangle county would listen through the years to tales
of the miseries and the miracles that happened thereafter

   the next five minutes were chaos the next fifteen were
almost senseless jumble of voices and movements and
groans and curses there were some vigilantes who didnt
stop to find out what the trouble was they turned their
horses and lit a shuck not caring where they went as long
as it was away more than a few were still puzzling over
what had happened when the morning dawned

cass gentry and hop randolph were the voices cry-
ing for order and somebody lighted a blazing brush
fire which rallied commonsense around it in the early
stages it was thought that abel bannister was among the
missing but they found him at the edge of the barrier pile-
up with a bloody head and a dead horse pinning his leg

   he sat in the firelight when his boot had been cut off
and his pants stagged at the knee and gritted his teeth as
he watched his ankle bloat he listened dazedly to the
hasty story cass gentry told

   there stand five prisoners to prove it cass finished
preach axton will make a sixth when he gets over the
gun-barrel that hop randolph laid over his head

   make it seven a voice drawled from the edge of dark-
ness heres a turkey buzzard i caught cuttin back out
the front end of the cut i was layin for im

   ollie shand pushed a scar-faced redhead into the bright-
ness

  you know ollie shand mr bannister cass asked
hes the boy you got to thank that half your vigilantes
aint either wounded or dead	

   the snaketrack boss looked up at shand then lowered
his head dumbly

   a mutter ran through the crowd that ringed the fire
a tall man pushed forward he glared at red helwig
tossed a coiled rope at the renegades feet

  what we waitin for he demanded cant nobody
find a tree

   hold it cass gentry called his voice lifted above
the rising growl these men are hired hands the man
gunswift	

whos responsible for killin your friends for all the hell
youve gone through is laughin at you back in triangle
town i can point im out i can prove his guilt if youll
let me have my way

  eyes turned towards abel bannister for answer the
pain-racked snaketrack man peered hard at cass my
tails in the dirt gentry he said you name the ticket
boy and ill back it

   i want a trial said cass an open trial for these
men and mebbe some others triangles the place and the
times as soon as we get there i want your citizens com-
mittee to sit in the jury box and ill need men to ride
ahead and round up some witnesses

   bannister looked at the faces around his vigilantes
they cast their votes silently

  well then said bannister somebody help me up
find me some kind of a horse to sit and lets get gone from
here

   they rode from cattail cut with seven prisoners with
nine men wounded or injured three vigilantes unfit to
ride were left behind to rest their hurts and guard the
dead the grumbling storm finally breaking whistled a
wind and lashed a downpour that chased the dark riders
half the way to triangle town

chapter xxxiv

triangle trial

rphe time was rounding four oclock the place was the
wheel of fortune and the trial was the strangest
spectacle in triangles history

  abel bannister was the judge he sat at the biggest
poker table his swollen footpropped on a chair his heavy
features grim with pain and purpose

   the leaders of the citizens committee were the secondary
magistrates they perched in semicircle at the same board
-henry gaunt frank irish martin burdette dan ven-
able eli lombard routed from their beds rushed half-
dressed to this demand appointment they were still be-
wildered

   the guardet prisoners roped in a chain were a huddle
near the wall some of the witnesses were being held in
venables rear room and part of the evidence was covered
by a tarp that draped another table the men who crowded
the end of the bar who sat and stood in a silent ring would
call the jurys verdict

  they were rain-soaked mud-splashed men and the
vigilante hurts they had carried from cattail cut were npt
the deepest sting of the nights happenings they had been
long goaded and all their frustrations had been crowned
scant hours back the memory of the dead they had left
behind was in their faces

   cass gentry spoke as prosecutor

   he did not have to lift his voice to carry through the
silence of the vaulted room he made a simple story of it
speaking slow and carefully and covering every detail he
knew this was kangaroo court and ruthless decision
would follow it cass wanted these men of triangle to
know the full truth before they called sentence

   greed was behind the troubles of triangle county he
told them the snatch of greed had aimed at the whole
six valleys section and its first gobble had been the murder
of matt mchale mchale had been the kingpin of the
valleys and his rocker dominated them mchale had re-
fused to sell at a reasonable price had announced plans to
tighten his grip on the free range and so he had been
murdered

  two men had been hired to kill him and with mchale
put out of the way the next move had been to wreck his
rocker spread thievery was the method

  tex cordill the rocker foreman had been bribed to
make things easy for the rustlers who started raiding right
and left a blizzard winter on top of those losses threw
the rocker into the bankrupt courts where the creditors
could pick its bones then the night-riders had spread out
their campaign to harry the smaller owners in the valleys
and put them on the rocks

  the question now cass said is who did the rustlin
and why it was natural to suppose that the same old
devils pocket crowd was at work and that the heavy teids
was ollie shands way of squarin up with the men who
hung his father

  but preacher axton there can tell you different him
and whats left of his homestead bunch or theres another
rqan who some of you men might have better reason to
believe considerin what hes done tonight step out and
tell em ollie shand

uor the first time most of them in the wheel of fortune
 saw the man whose name for years had been curse in
triangle they heard his drawled words

  the shands had been cleaned from the devils pocket
ollie said by matt mchales surprise party those ofthe
original bunch who had escaped had scattered far ollie
himself had been living in a remote shack panning a little
creek he had discovered

  the pocket stood deserted until the week mchale
was killed red helwig and five-six strangers drifted back
then they started raiding about the time that the home-
stead bunch moved into the valleys axtons crowd worked
hand-in-glove with them

  it was the damnedest kind of cattle-thievery he ever
heard of ollie maintained they sold some of the stolen
stuff through old milos regular outlets but many a time
they just scattered the bunches they drove away there
were sections in the deep beyond right now he said where
hundreds of head were running wild

  you gents can figger that out for yourselves cass
said anyhow there your rustlers stand seven of em
ask em who brought them in here who they took their
pay and their orders from and theyll tell two names-
wash parsons and vic barth but before we swing around
to that-how about these seven here they were caught
in murder theyve admitted theyre thieves whats to be
done with em

  he looked at abel bannister bannister glanced at the
other faces around the table

  what do you men say how about it henry-you
dan-martin whats the lawyers verdict

  burdettes handsome face was drawn he pushed his
fingers through tousled hair this procedure is nonsense
gentlemen you cant-you have no authority-these men
should be delivered to the law

  what law said bannister wincing he cursed his
ankle ben quigg and his swede sidekick have gone from
town bag and baggage mebbe you want tq hand em over
to the govenor yourself when you take your law-and-order
petition down he grunted how do you see it frank
the little banker had been studying the faces of the men
ringed around i vote with the majority he announced
a long rope and a short prayer he looked up meaningly
at the sturdy rafters

  what about you mr lombard cass spoke above the
rumble from the crowd what do you call

  eli lombard gave him a quick glance his lean face was
pinched in thought his lips moved nervously a shake of
head was his answer

cass held up his hand and the murmuring faded around
the watching circle there was a bustle of movement
from beyond the main doors where a double guard had been


argosy

posted the outer walk and puddled wampum street held
a throng that increased with the passing minutes the
grapevine of excitement had wakened sleeping houses had
lighted lamps all over triangle town

   you men can name the sentence you choose cass said
 theres still a bigger dog though to be judged along with
 the pups theres a number eight man in this room whos
 guiltier than these seven put together id like your leave
 to point my finger and see who it stops on

   a deeper silence spread

   cass let his gray eyes rove from face to face trying to
 think of what must be said of the steady steps he must take
 toward the accusation knowing the truth and proving it
 are horses of different colors he was not a talking man
 not a speech-maker and his task would not be easy the
 weasel-man who must be trapped was not the kind to
 be caught by force or threats he wasnt the wash parsons
 breedwho would blurt his guilt at sight of a gun-snout
 heres the story of number eight cass began

   this man had a special reason for wanting the valleys
 he told them the murder of mchale the stripping of the
 rocker the ambush of the vigilantes tonight-these were
 moves in a carefully planned scheme the brains of the
 scheme had hidden his identity behind vic barth his right-
 hand man and barth in turn had passed the lesser chores
 along to wash parsons this was the combination re-
 sponsible for the recent troubles of triangle county

   now theres some of this i cant exactly prove cass
 said tex cordill who let the rocker be milked dry and
 who hurried forth to set his sights for me and swifty-tex
 is dead and buried

   the yellowback bills stole by barth and parsons when
 they shot old matt mchale-theyre still bein hunted for
 duke costello who had reasons to suspect the crooked
 deal cant tell em now he died a little while ago i hear

 i had the two men who could shout the loudest brought into
 this room right over there-

   with the lift of his hand hop randolph whipped off
 the tarp that shrouded a nearby table the bodies of vic
 barth and wash parsons were stretched upon it

   but their talkins done cass said

   he had been watching the face of his man he had
 planned this little move in hope of seeing some sign of be-
 trayal but the features of number eight showed no more
 surprise or no less than did the others who sat with him

 wifty ogden and myself said cass could tell

   o	you what parsons admitted tonight before barth
 killed im theres a woman in back-you call her madame
 mustache-who could also swear to it

   but theres no reason why three like us should be
 trusted above a man you people know so well so the best
 i can do i reckon is to show what kind of a jigger this
 number eight had to be and let the rest of you guess his
 name along with me

   he looked at martin burdette

   my man had to be a real smart gent he said he
 had to know the inside workings of the rocker and be close
 enough to matt mchale to know what plans he had hed
 need to be a real ambitious man who held a high opinion of
 himself hed be a fellow who savvied the ins and outs of
 the law-

   damn you gentry you have no right- the hand-
 some young lawyer scraped back his chair i demand an
 opportunity-i refuse to listen-i appeal to the men who
 know me-

   sit down cass said harshly my man also needed
   some guts burdette he had to be a real tough fighter not
   a show-off he had to have ideas that he didnt read in
   books i dont mean you burdette its a wider stripe of
   skunk im huntin

 he turned quickly to confront the man at bannisters
 left and his voice sharpened the kill was close-the kill
 or the miss whichever it chanced to be

   and my man needed money he said it called for
 cash in his pocket to pay the bills vic barth ran up to
 bribe cordill and pay the wages of preach axton and his
 crew he had to have the itch for makin money too-the
 kind of scissorbill whos always willin to take a dollar in
 trade for sixty cents

   he knows what land is worth and how much cattle
 will bring and he likes the feel of power in his fist that
 his deeds and mortgages give im as far as number eights
 concerned the rights or the life of any other man are
 worth no more than the price of the bullet that steals em
 eli lombard lifted a skinny hand claw-fingered no
 he gasped i swear to god-

   bring em in cass called and swifty ogden herded
 two protesting men from the rear room they were curious
 figures the tall pink-skinned britisher jeffery edmund
 talbot and his saddle-brown man friday

   but number eight had to be a gambler too cass
 said he had to be willin to take a chance that kind of
 lets lombard out-dont it mr irish

   the tuft-haired little banker looked at cass with steady
 eyes with eyes brightly inquiring

   is your finger pointing at me gentry he said
   straight at you cass said and my gun behind it

chapter xxxv

when the gunsmoke settles

 frank irish turned quickly to bannister the snake-
 track rancher kept his features impassive he surveyed
 irish his friend and poker companion through the years
 with a horse-traders look of measurement

   the banker swept his gaze around the other faces-
 venable gaunt the throng of townsmen and cowhands who
 were accustomed to give him their politeness and respect
 when he passed along the street when his horse clopped the
 country roads they were watching him gravely waiting
 his defense

   for somehow cass gentry had managed to turn the
 doubtful trick if he had openly accused frank irish he
 would have met with instant disbelief if he had jumped
 straight to the attack the banker could have countered
 every thrust could have hammered the lack of proof

   the crowd would have been behind him from the be-
 ginning and tonight the crowd was the jury no formal
 court of law would convict frank irish on the evidence
 cass could offer but now he stood at the bar of the
 fundamental justice

   irish realized that fact he made no bluff of indigna-
 tion no splutter of protest as the others had instead he
 turned on his monkeys grin

   this should be good he said go on with your brain-
 storm gentry

   cass kept his voice at the conversational level it was
 quite a brainstorm when it first occurred to me he said
 but the more i thought it over the clearer i saw that it
 couldnt be anybody else

   you were mighty clever about it you arranged the deal
 so that vic barth was your only direct connection and
 even with vic you took no chances i dont know what sly
 way you had for passin your orders along to im but i
 reckon it was just as neat as your stunt of hidin money in
 out-of-the-way places like lombards stable for vic to
 collect

 you and vic might have cooked that one up special
 for wash parsons benefit i dont know it fooled wash
 all right and for a while it fooled me but lombard wasnt
gunswift



man enough to fit the rest of the picture i knew that
keep right on boy said irish blandly you may say
three words any minute thatve got some sense in em

  i admire the way you handled a lot of this business
said cass for one thing there was that money that barth
and parsons robbed off mchale you made sure it was
in new currency that could be traced you convinced barth
it wouldnt be safe to pass and mebbe you promised to
make it good when your big scheme went through that
tied barth pretty close to you it gave you a ten-thousand-
dollar hold on him and didnt cost a single penny

  irish looked beyond cass at the crowd the faces were
unchanged they were patient attentive and in them he
saw the same cast of interest he had noted in the silent men
who watch the fall in a poker deal

  and you were slick as bear grease cass said when
you gave me that big talk in your office that day you were
so pleased with the way things had gone so cocksure that
your trail was snowed under that you had to open the
strings of your bag and show the inside

  i reckon you figgered your game was so close to the
windup and i was so dumb compared to you that you
might as well enjoy yourself you took pity on a lone-hand
stranger buckin the big combine that had fooled triangle
county for good long months

  you just about pushed my nose into burnt mills you
cleared suspicion off this man and that the one lie you
told me was a mighty little one at the time you said
that talbot was lookin to buy some minin lands in brule
county

  irish offered his first rebuttal and i can show the
etters and papers that prove the transaction he said
what about it

  sure you can show the papers said cass you could
fill this room with proof i bet if given time enough but
when we dragged talbot out of his bed just a while back
and showed how serious we meant business he gave us
other facts

  hes not ashamed of bein the colonial agent so he
calls himself of the inter-island cattle company hes a
big stockholder too the inter-island company runs one
of the biggest and most successful spreads in texas they
think their methods would work in thenorth as well if they
could find the layout they want talbots been lookin for
the right one these couple of years

the englishman made a long forward stride glaring at
cass perfectly open transaction he muttered
logical reason for concealing my connections name of
inter-island starts you fellows demanding fantastic prices
fantastic

  it was a wide-open deal said irish quickly i named
talbot a minin man on his own say-so he was a client of
the exchange bank another of our clients had liens on
certain properties and i was no more than go-between-
you lie said cass the bright-eyed little man was
beginning to show the strain he thought irish still main-
tained his poker face but he was sitting straighter putting
bite into his voice and now was the time to nail him

  you lie cass repeated the inter-island people
wanted the whole valleys section it was over a year ago
that talbot named the whackin price theyd be willin to
pay you agreed to handle the purchase to deliver the kit
and kaboodle if given time you could see a big-sized profit
if the land was grabbed up cheap you set your first bait
for the biggest fish for the rockerknowin the rest would
come easy when matt mchale was hooked

  you patched up your quarrel with mchale he ham-
mered on you had im primed to sell-usin lombard for
your dummy in the deal-and all at once he kicked over
the traces he turned bull-headed and you could see your

speculation goin up in smoke all your fine plans wasted

  it must have galled you mr irish-a brainy man like
you bein blocked by sheer mulishness it got your dander
up i guess to see a man you despised as no moren a peg-
legged fire-snorter robbin easy profits from your jeans
you begun to puzzle what might be done if he was pushed
out of the way

  all the time of course you stayed real friendly with
im you talked his plans and problems over like a
brother he explained his scheme for controllin the free
range by hirin his own men to file homestead claims on
the key sections-duke costellos old idea-and when he
came to draw on you for the money hed need to swing that
proposition you saw youd have to stop im the hard way
you stalled im for a week claimin you hadnt the money
on hand and meantime you hatched his murder with vic
barth

  cass paused breathing deep frank irish stared straight
at him his lips locked against hasty words the scoffing
answers the sharp retorts must have been racing through
his brain but he restrained his parries he was sensing
the temper of the room weighing the hush that surrounded
him estimating the emotions he read in the faces if he
could create a doubt in them if he could shift the issue to a
court of proof 

itarth carried out his job cass said axtons
buzzards slickered their end of it and you done
your share mr irish when we can dig into the vaults
of your bank well likely be able to find how much of
mchales money you got away with

  wasnt you the good friend who advised on his invest-
ments where would he keep his bonds and valuables
except in one of your strong-boxes why would you lend
im ten thousand dollars on a note of hand except that you
aready held his securities of many times that value i
can almost hear you mr irish convincin im that it would
be quicker to borrow the money than to sell off any stocks
he had

  i can just about see you once he was dead lootin his
property you held in charge you took his good securities
and left only worthless paper and debts you destroyed his
new will which showed im a wealthy man and left a six-
year-old one which proved nothin

  and thats my picture mr irish he continued
thats why i point you the number eight it wasnt any
great task i suppose for a man in your high place but
again i give yoji credit for your weasel ways you used
mchales known squabbles the enemies he had to cloud
the truth behind his murder

  your rustlers rode under cover of ollie shands reputa-
tion it gave you pleasure to badger abel bannister into
formin his vigilantes you took your good advantage of
burdette and eli lombard too

  burdette counted you a wise man a big important man
and it wasnt too hard to flatter or steer im as you chose
all lombard wanted was quick sure profits you could
wangle him into any of your land or money deals usin his
name to hide your own and hed be none the wiser

   cass shook his head slightly yessir he said i got to
hand it to you you had this town so buffaloed that you
even could afford to rub it in you told your views to any
whod listen and mostly they were true you grabbed
quick at any chance that offered to pull more wool over
triangles eyes

  that stunt of yours blockin vic barth from me when
i stood drunk in the happy hour-folks liked the looks of
that i reckon they admired too the sound of the sentence
you just passed on your own men standin there a long
rope and a short prayer-do you still stick by that mr
irish


argosy

tthe little banker did not speak he said not a word to
defend or betray himself his confession was in-
voluntary a surge of emotion that his will could not deny

  he sat stiffly posed his poker-face and shining eyes con-
fronting cass gentry and a corner of his mouth lifted in
his familiar monkeys grin and suddenly all his features
were contorted in a wry spasm wrinkles of rage ridged
his forehead pinched his eyes carved fury between his
brows his lips twitched in a red-gummed snarl that was
sheer malevolence

  damn you frank abel bannister said thickly his
fist smashed into the bankers face knocking him back
with his chair

there were twenty hands to grab him to jerk him up
he found his voice then screaming out in terror no he
shrilled for gods sake men-abe-eli-you cant-
a fierce hand hushed him clamping his mouth arms
subdued his struggles

  is there any doubt boys bannister called

  he stood to face the crowding men the jury that shouted
grim verdict in half a hundred voices none of them had
a doubt

  he named his own judgment bannister cried his
arm lifted high and his finger pointed the gallows death
among the rafters   

  cass gentry pushed through the milling figures the
slump of letdown made him suddenly weak now the sights
and sounds that would roll the wheel of fortune thereafter
-no he had smelled enough death tonight

  the guards had quitted their posts at the outer doors
and staring townsmen packed the entrance cass bulled a
passage edged through the overflow that jammed the walk
dawn was graying the sky and the wind was fresh upon his
cheek as he reached the outer fringe he heard his name
cass cass-

  she called from the opposite walk mary ellen she was
stepping into the street raising her hand in salute and cass
ran with a muddy splash she came to meet him speaking
his name softly again and there was no thought of where
they stood or how many eyes might turn to see them

  she was strong in his embrace they would not re-
member the words they said but what their lips and their
clinging arms said was a memory never to be forgotten



the sun rose in golden fire behind the hills it rode the
clear curved sky and it vanished at the end of day in
red-streaked glory the dusk spread peace over triangle
town

  did it all happen cass mary ellen said was it
realtor was it a crazy dream i had

  the craziness is done he said you-the town-in
a little while youll be back to things as they used to be
whats wrong cass whats the matter

  im all right i-well i may be a little sleepy

  i talked to henry gaunt this afternoon she said he
was dr farabaughs best friend-his only friend i guess
mr gaunt doesnt know the full story himself but he
thinks that ada must have been insane she blamed the
doctor for the injury that crippled her-he struck her mr
gaunt thinks and she fell down the stairs-and she kept to
her chair and her loneliness out of spite she made mock
attempts at suicide did everything to make him miserable
cass shook his head i never suspicioned id sworn
that shot in the stable was aimed for me there was one
slip of the tongue farabaugh made drivin me to town
but i plumb forgot it later he-well i even admired im

  i havent told anyone else she said that he was a
scout for milo shand there was a bankbook in his pocket
henry gaunt said that listed several thousand dollars in
deposits it was issued in another name on a bank in an-
other state

  his share of the rustlin rakeoff cass nodded ridnv
the roads as he did pokin around through the country
i expect he was in good position to know where the cattle
bunched and how close the watch was

  whats wrong with you she said again what makes
you sound so moody

  not a thing  i hear martin burdette stopped by
to see you this afternoon

  oh- she smiled faintly why yes he did he
offered his legal services to the rocker he said the final
check of frank irishs private papers at the bank hadnt
been completed but that a considerable amount of money
was certain to be recovered i also had an offer to sell the
rocker today mr talbot said he would take it off my
hands at a fair settlement

  yeah cass muttered they say he made offers to
the pothook and three-four others its a break for those
outfits most of em owed money to irish and hed been
able to buy em out for a song if last nights ambush went
off on schedule

  i turned down talbots offer cass she said so did
the others we had a meeting while you were still asleep
and discussed a number of things theres a plan on foot
to run the valleys outfits as a pool proposition

  theres no reason why we cant make money here if
the inter-islands people could its a matter of changing
over the old methods of breeding up the stock of better
marketing i told the committee youd talk it over with
them tomorrow

  me he said whats it got to do with me

  well need a man to pull things together cass theres
got to be a boss of the layout-

  no ne said gruffly its no use in that i-you know
what i am your business will straighten around without
need of me when the gunsmoke settles-he looked at
her-cass gentry blows away

  but not this time she said never again cass i
wont let you blow away

  but you know how i am i never had roots i like the
smell of trouble im not the easy kind of man

  i know youre not youd be as bull-strong and mettle-
some as matthew mchale ever was-if i let you be but
thats what love is for cass to bring people together well
share the problems and the fights as they come and the
two of us will lick them

  but hell- he said you got-well i cant even give
you a name you know where cass gentry come from-
from a book i stole i dont know who i am

  and does that make any difference cass she said
it doesnt matter who or what you were yesterday or last
week or last year right now youre the man i love im
proud of cass gentrys name for what it means today and
-ill be prouder of what were going to make it mean to-
morrow

  she was smiling and her eyes were so bright that an
answering brightness blurred cass gentrys sight she
leaned into the curve of his arm lifting her lips and cass
knew that as long as he had her wisdom to keep him steady
and her love to hold tight with both fists that his road
would be straight-lined with happiness

  mrs cass gentry  it had a sound to it at that it
had a pretty ring to it

the end
a couple of weeks ago we
were saying how curious it is
that people like to read stories
about their own vocations cowboys
reading westerns pilots reading air
stories and so on since then weve
heard some interesting things about
what the drafted men are reading

   well one of our spies-one of your
 favorite authors in fact-had a long
 chat with a draft-camp librarian and
 discovered that the most popular
 books in the army training camps are
 the personal-experience stories of the
 last war ed streeters dere mabel
 and the stories of arthur guy empey
 and captain thomason-this is the
 sort of thing the boys are asking for
 and enjoying

   were not sure whether this is
surprising or not but we think it is
at any rate it is further evidence
that people like to meet their own
lives in print after a day of trumpets
and salutes of marching and practice
with the guns the drafted men settle
down with books that resound with
trumpets and sharp commands per-
haps these soldiers who are at peace
want to know how their predecessors
lived in war or perhaps they simply
enjoy watching someone else perform
the military routine that they have
just completed for the day we dont
know but it is all very interesting

   we have this week a scorecard
from a correspondent whose name
 should be familiar to all of you he
has listed his favorite stories of 
classifying and grading them here

 i just iead of the death of one of
 argosys greatest authors fred
 maclsaac it makes me feel rather
 sad as i can remember that some
 of argosys best stories were writ-
 ten by him i dont think i will
 ever forget his the wild man of
 cape cod 

 i	do have to admit that you are
 doing a first-rate job of bringing
 back old authors and bringing in
 new ones that can really write
 such as h bedford-jones bloch-
 man gluck etc for old authors

and warren myers byrne etc
for the new ones

gunplay has been getting us
into a lot of trouble lately here
is another letter from a firearms ex-
pert  he does not specify what stories
he found mistakes in but it is quite
obvious that he found them possibly
the only solution is to establish a
shooting range for our authors mem-
bers of the editorial staff wilf be ex-
pected to volunteer as targets theyll
be safe enough

  anyway our thanks to

  robert p crawford

    i have been reading this maga-
  zine for many years and i have
  never found another that gave me
  so many real stories and so much
  entertainment i believe it to be
  the best magazine of jhis kind pub-
  blished today

    relying on your good judgment

  i am voicing a criticism which
  i hope you will take in the spirit
  i make it faithful are the wounds
  of a friend but deceitful are the
  kisses of an enemy

    i	think you should have a school
  for authors in the writing of inci-
  dents in which gunplay is involved

    first every soldier knows that
  the speed of a bullet is about six
  times that of sound every author
  tells about some adventurer hear-
  ing the report of a gun and the
  howl of the bullet later this could
  not happen from my experience
  as a marker in a rifle butt on a mili-
  tary range i know that no report
  is heard at the target until after the
  bullet arrives ask any real expert

    second any one hit by a forty-
  five caliber or thirty-eight caliber
  bullet is slapped down so hard that
  he sees stars ask any surviver of
  a gun fight

    third bullets especially from
  high-caliber guns do not break
  window glass they merely punch
  a hole almost the exact size of the
  bullet get an old window sash with
  the glass intact and take your fav-
  orite gun out in the alley and see
  how many of the bullets it will take
  to break out all the glass you will
  find plenty of holes but very few of


them with radial cracks around
them

  fourth the old wheeze about
the heros gun being out of commis-
sion when dropped in the water is
another big laugh to he man who
knows this would only have been
true back in the seventies when
cap-and-ball guns were used i have
fired forty-five caliber rifle shells
that were broiight up from the
wreck of the battleship maine ten
years after she sank in havana har-
bor

   fifth in a description of an in-
cident your author solemnly avers
that his hero killed a man at five
hundred yards with a muzzle-load-
ing rifle in the first place he would
have to be equipped with an old-
fashioned step-ladder rear sight to
give him at least an inch and a half
elevation in the rear sight before his
muzzle would be raised at the right
angle to pitch the bullet that far
further he could not have seen
his target five-hundred-yard
bulls-eyes are six feet across

  sixth the way your authors
misuse the old forty-five colt is ter-
rible in your magazine and in the
movies too we see the desperate
hero with his empty colt using the
butt to lay out his enemies and to
break down the closed door exam-
ine one of those weapons take off
the handles and look you will see
a comparatively thin strap of steel
that holds them to the gun one
blow with the butt would disable the
weapon entirely

  the real westerner who was
raised in the seventies and eight-
ies kept his grip on the handle of

argosy

  his empty gun and laid the old girl
  all three pounds of her across the
  brow of his enemy or punched him
  with the muzzle one punch with
  the muzzle of a colt will snap a
  rib or fracture a skull

    when the western sheriff went
  through a door he merely paused to
  shoot the lock off then he walked
  in try it the next time you find
  you have left your door keys in the
  car your wife might not like it
  but the door will be open

    i	want to apologize for griping
  so much but in the interest of good
  period literature i hope you will
  forgive me i am not writing to get
  my name in your magazine it is
  merely because i like you

  shreve ohio

our next correspondent is a sea-
faring man it is clear from his
letter that the chief discomfort of a
voyage is the impossibility of keeping
up with the argosy serials

e fabian

    first let me state i have been
  reading argosy ever since it came
  out or very close to it it is so far
  back i cant remember i was only
  a young fellow when i started read-
  ing it and i am s years young now
  noted in the argonotes of june
  nd  where a william a
  harty has been reading argosy for
  thirty years and believe i can top
  him by far

   remember one story in argosy
  long time ago called the return
  of george washington mr tut-
  tles stories of henry and his trou-
  bles in tonto town zagats stories

of dikar and the bunch and capt
hornblower by forester dr kil-
dare by max brand the sun sets
at   every thursday
and others too numerous to men-
tion-all of these were good stories

  as for the stories minions of
the moon mars etc i cant say
as i care for them very much al-
though i read all of them the
writer i will say has some imagi-
nation

  as i am a seafaring man i get
behind in my serials due to the fact
that it is impossible to get an
argosy for a week or two weeks
back after the new issue is out i
have asked a number of dealers
about it and they claim that they
have to turn in the old copies and
very seldom keep a back number

  so at times i have to wait three
or four months before the copy i
am behind in shows up at some sec-
ond-hand book store this throws
me back in the serial right now i
am seven months behind but have
back numbers now and will catch
up again soon

  on this run between san fran-
cisco puget sound ports colum-
bia river and then to the hawai-
ian islands and back to san fran-
cisco i do not get very far behind
but when the ship was on the ha-
waiian island-east coast run which
takes twenty-eight days i was al-
ways far behind in my serials on
present run i am not out more than
nine or ten days

  i	like the argosy and enjoy all
the stories and will continue to read
it give us some more dikar stor-
ies and others mentioned above
