 south america where he launched a great colonization	j

 services lo france in the interests of propaganda  the	

 four horsemen of the apocalypse brought him recognition	

  throughout the allied worldt especially in the united states	

  where he is as widely read as the most popular native writers	i

a sleepy spanish town of the
valencian ribera - benimus-
im white walls and dark
roofs perching above a sea of olive
trees and vineyards a church bel-
fry with green tiles an old moor-
ish fortress with crumbling time-
worn battlements against the daz-
zlingblue sky benimushn  a vil-
lage like all the villages of spain-
backward dull unchanging pic-
turesque-the habitat of prejudice
and tradition of burning passions
and undying hatreds simple folk
indifferent to the great world and its
doings absorbed in their own loves
and spites and ambitions benimus
hn-the home of marieta of toni
el desgarral of rio sento-and a
few hundred others like them

ii

tio sento uncle sento
had announced his intentions
he was getting married for
the second time

  to understand the commotion
this piece of news occasioned in ben-
imushn you must know that the wid-
ower tto sento was the leading citi-
zen the biggest tax-payer in the lo-
cality and further that his bride-to-
be was marieta the village beauty
but the daughter of a teamster her
dowry a bewitching dark face
dimples a pair of black eyes spark-
ling like gems under long lashes and
rolls of thick shining hair held
against her temples by gaudy pins

  now benimushn could not re-
cover from its surprise and its
anger everyone said the same thing


world fiction

a man his age marrying a chit of a
girl like that what was the world
coming to there was tio sento
owner of half the real estate in town
with a hundred skins of wine in his
cellar and five mules in his barn
and who was to get all that a
piece of rubbish from the sidewalks
-marieta the teamsters daughter
who had stolen for a living as a
little thing and now grown up was
glad to do house-work for the meals
there were in it and now about
stria tomasa tio sentos first wife
she had brought him the big house
in the calle mayor and her farm
lands she had even fitted up the
bedroom with all that furniture she
had been so proud of when she was
alive would she not turn over in
her grave to think of it going to a
waif of the streets to whom she had
so often given a meal in the kitchen
out of pure christian charity

  fifty-six years old and marrying
for love was the old fool a regu-
lar satyr see the way he danced
time to every word she said a silly
smile on his face like a young fel-
low in love for the first time

  all benimuslin agreed that tio
sento had lost his mind the sun-
day when the bans were read in
church there was almost a riot
some of the men folks of sind to-
masas family were there and how
they cursed after mass was over
talk about your thieves sir to-
masa willed all that property to her
husband very well but she under-
stood that he would never forget
her that he would always be faith-
ful to her memory and what was
the old rascal doing passing it all
over to another woman - and a
young one like that and he fifty-
six no there was no justice on
earth if such things went on sue
him to get the dowry back lots
of good that would do the courts

were not to be trusted these days
as don vicente the rector said if
don carlos were in power then
   perhaps i

  so those who considered them-
selves directly injured by the pro-
posed match grumbled at the cafes
in the square and so everybody
grumbled not excluding the girls of
the wealthier families who would
willingly have tendered their fair
young hands to that old rooster not-
withstanding his paunch and the
hard little eyes under enormous
brows that contained-his enemies
said-half a bushel of hair

  the whole town knew moreover
that marieta had a sweetheart
toni el desgarrat toni rags in
other words had been a vagrant
like her as a little boy and now a
loafer about the wine-shops he still
loved her with the best of inten-
tions in fact the two good-for-
nothings had been postponing mar-
riage only until rags should de-
velop a taste for work and leave the
company he was keeping for tonis
boon companion and bosom friend
was dimoni a clarinet player from
a neighboring town who came in to
see him at least once a week to cele-
brate a grand spree in some tavern
and then sleep it off afterwards in
somebodys haystack

  the relatives of sin a tomasa sud-
denly took a liking to rags in
the town loafer they saw a possible
avenger of their wrongs and other
people too people of the better sort
people who had never stooped to
speak to him in their lives now
sought him out in his favorite drink-
ing place

  hows this desgarrat they
asked banteringly they say ma-
rietas getting married

  rags hitched about on his stool
stroked the flashy blanket he had
thrown across his knees transferred
a wedding serenade



his cigarette to the other corner of
his mouth and gazed for a moment
at the glass of red wine in front of
him

   finally he shrugged his shoulders

   so they say     well well
see about it recordons the old
man had better not brag till he comes
home with the bacon

   that is why everybody was sure
something exciting would soon be
happening for tio sento was all
a man himself a man among the
best of them he had his say
around election time he had a
pull with the governor at valen-
cia he had been mayor several
times more than once in the open
square he had raised his heavy cane
and beaten bigger fellows than he
was just because he found them in
his way

   he would take no nonsense from
toni cl dcsgarrat the whole town
was sure of that and benimuslin
looked forward to an interesting
time

ill

tio sento indeed never did
things half way that was
obvious when the day for
signing the marriage contract came
since his bride lacked a dowry he
gave her one himself-three hun-
dred onzas gold if you please not
counting the wedding dress the
rings the cfcmbs and the furniture
that had belonged to siiid tomasa
the girls of the village flocked in
company to mari etas place-a
wretched shack with a cart in the
front yard and three underfed nags
in the stable where her father the
teamster jived out beyond the last
house on the road to valencia and
holding hands or their arms about
each others waists they walked
around the big table in the front
room where all her wedding pres-

ents were heaped up on display

  holy mother how many prettv
things i towels tafafccloths hand-
kerchiefs bandanas underclothing
skirts silk and linens worked with
monograms and arabesques and ar-
ranged in piles according to sizes
that almost reached the ceiling i all
the friends and the dependents of tio
sento were remembering the happv
pair among dishes and silver-
plated knives and forks and the
porcelain holy-water fonts for the
bridal chamber were two handsome
candlesticks from the marquis-the
cacique the political boss or the dis-
trict-the greatest man in spain
tio sento called him-for whom
moreover he was ever ready to
wield his cane or level his shotgun
when it came to returning the mar-
quis as deputy to parliament

  on a shelf in the most conspicu-
ous place in the room were the
brides jewels pearl earrings in the
shape of bunches of grapes a num-
ber of brooches with complicated
pendants gold side combs three
gold hair pins for her hair and
that set of bracelets earrings
and necklace so much talked of
in benimuslin for which sin a to-
masa had paid fourteen doubloons
at a big store in the capital

  talk about your luck but ma-
rieta blushed modestly at all the jeal-
ous congratulations heaped upon her
for her great catch while her moth-
er a sickly over-worked and now
aged peasant woman wept great
tears of pure joy and the teamster
trotted effusively back and forth in
the trail of tio sento finding no
words humble enough and grateful
enough for the munificence of his
future son-in-law

  the contract was to be read and
signed at the teamsters house that
night don julian the notary ac-
companied by his secretary drove


world fiction

up about sundown in his two-
wheeled cart a portable writing set
sticking out of his pocket and a roll
of stamped official paper under his
arm

  a special table lighted by a four-
armed candlestick had been set up
in the kitchen and the notary
entered in triumph what a learned
what an impressive representative
of the lawl don julian read his
texts in dialect peppering the
high-flown legal phrases with side
remarks of his own just try to
keep your face straight in the pres-
ence of that joker
who looked like
a priest with his
long black coat and
his puffy clean-
shaven face and
what wrere those
glasses for if he
always wore them
high up on his
forehead

  as the notary
dictated and dic-
tated his clerk
wrote and wrote
the pen scratching
noisily on the
rough stamped
paper mean-
while the priest
and friends of the two families
were coming in the wedding
presents had been removed from
the table in the front room and
in their places cakes and sweet-
meats had appeared tarts and bit-
ter almonds and bottle after bottle
of cordials-rose and maraschino

 ahem ahem ahem don
julian cleared his throat several
times rose from his seat smoothed
the flaps of his long coat pulled it
down in front by the lapels and
picked up the pages of writing in
front of him grains of sand from

the fresh pages dropped upon the
table

  what a case he was wthen he
came to the bridgegrooms name he
twisted his face into a grotesque
scowl that tio sento was the first to
applaud with a great burst of laugh-
ter wthen he came to marietas
he made a deep bow in imitation of
an old-fashioned gallant in the ball-
room and again everybody laughed
but when he began on the terms of
the contract-doubloons vineyards
houses fields horses mules -
avarice and jealousy darkened those
rustic faces tio
sento was the only
one to smile-sat-
isfied that all those
people should
know howr rich and
powerful he was
and how hand-
somely he wras
treating his chosen
woman marietas
parents were un-
able to restrain
their tears gen-
erous was no name
for it and their
neighbors nodded
assent yes you
could trust your
daughter to a
man like that and be sure of your-
self 

  after the formalities of signing
wrere over the refreshments were
passed around don julian paraded
the best of his well-known stock of
jests and stories maliciously nudg-
ing don vicente the priest in the
ribs and facetiously planning with
that austere ascetic a terrible de-
bauch for the wedding day

  at eleven oclock everything was
over the priest went home scan-
dalized at his own remissness in hav-
ing stayed awake so late the may-
a wedding serenade



or left with him at last tio sento
rose with the notary and the secre-
tary he had invited them to pass
the remainder of the night at his
house

  the road beyond marietas cot-
tage was dark dark as the open
country on a moonless night is dark
above the houses toward the town
the stars were sparkling in the deep
blue of the sky some dogs were
barking in the barnyards the
village itself was sound asleep

  the notary and
h i s companions
picked their way
cautiously onward
to avoid stumbling
over the stones
in those unknown
roads  ave ma-
ria purisima 
called a hoarse
voice in the dis-
tance eleven
oclock-and all is
well the sereno
the night watch-
man was going
his rounds

  don julian felt
a sense of uneasi-
ness creeping over
him in that inky
darkness he
thought he saw sus-
picious signs of life
at the corner of the street leading
down toward marietas house
someone seemed to be watching her
door

  look out look out

  there was an explosion followed
by a rasping hissing sound from
the corner a thick stream of fire
seemed to dart outward through the
air wriggling twisting in rapid
flight while the notarys hair stood
on end

  a rocket a rocket there was

a joke for you i the notary
tened against the door of a huse
his assistant groveling in terror at
his feet the ball of fire struck the
wall above his head rebounded to
the other side of the street then
from the house there back again
emitting a shrill whistle on each leg
of its journey till finally it exploded
with a deafening bang

  tio sento had stopped unper-
turbed in the middle of the street

   redenl by god i i know who
did that y ou
filthy jail-bird 
and shaking his
heavy cane he
made for the cor-
ner certain that
around it he would
find el desgarrat
with all the gang
of his fiist wifes
relatives

iv

the bells of
benimus
lrn had been
ringing since break
of day

  the news of tio
sentos approach-
ing wedding had
reached the limits
of the district and
from every hand
friends and relatives were coming
in some riding their work horses
with gay colored blankets for saddle
cloths others in wagons their
families perched on stools along the
cart sides

  tio sentos house where no one
had had a moments rest for near
on a weekt was a center of noisy
bustling activity the best women
cooks in the neighborhood for miles
around had been marshalled for
the glad occasion and were going


world fiction

to and fro in kitchen and yard their
sleeves rolled up their skirts caught
up behind showing the white petti-
coats underneath piles and piles of
faggots had been heaped up within
easy reach of the fires the village
butcher was slaughtering hens in the
back yard where the ground was
literally carpeted with feathers tta
pascuala the old servant in the
house with the skill of a surgeon
was opening chickens extracting
the livers hearts and gizzards to
make the tastiest sauces and tidbits
of the feast what a thing it was
to have money

all the arriving
guests poor farm-
ers for the most
part condemned
year in year out
to musty sardines
and salty codtish
could feel their
mouths water at
the prospect of
one whole day
of abundant cheer

  such an array
of eatables had
never been seen
in all the history
of beni mus-
lin copper pots
sooty on the out-
side but shiny
within full of rice and chicken were
bubbling over the fire in one cor-
ner was a pile of fresh bread as big
as a cord of wood there was pan
after pan of mountain snails stewing
on the big stove a huge tin box of
spices was sitting in the cupboard
wine-skins were being brought up
by the dozen from the cellars-the
large ones with red wine for the
meal the smaller filled with that
white liquid fire from tio sentos
famous  corner barrel that had
proved too much for the strongest

drinkers in the district as for
sweets to throw to the children after
the ceremony-they were there by
the basketful-almonds cinnamon
drops balls of sugar and starch as
hard as bullets and as tio sento
gleefully surveyed the animated
scene he thought with cruel anticipa-
tion of the lumps those missiles
would raise on the heads of the
youngsters who would be on hand
for the scramble

  yes things were getting along
fine i everything was ready every-
body was turning out even di-
moni the clarinet
player had come
in before time-
for tio sento
sparing no ex-
pense to make the
day a grand one
had ordered that
dimoni be kept
well supplied with
drink for as
everyone knew
he played much
better when sev-
eral sheets to the
wind

  the bells of the
church stopped
ringing the time
for the ceremony
was at hand the
nuptial procession marched to the
home of the bride the women in
their best full-skirted dresses the
men in their gala cloaks with long
blue capes and in high starched col-
lars that chafed their ears from
marietas home they started back
toward the church first came a
troop of boys capering and turning
handsprings around dimoni who
was playing with his head thrown
back and his instrument up in the
air as if it were a prolongation of his
nose and through it he were sniffing
a wedding serenade



at the sky next came the bridal
couple ho sento in a new velvet hat
a longsleeved coat too tight about
the waist embroidered stockings and
brand new sandals marieta   oh
marieta i reina y siiiora how
pretty she looked a real ladv
from valencia could not have done
better she had on an expensive
lace mantilla a manila shawl with
long fringes a silk skirt puffed out
by four or five petticoats a pearl
rosary in her hand a huge plaque of
gold for a brooch and in her ears
the splendid pearls that siiid to-
masa had worn in her time

  the whole town was waiting in
front of the church-even some of
si fid tomasas relatives who car-
ried away by their curiosity had
come along in spite of the clans de-
cision to boycott the ceremony they
kept in the background however
standing on tiptoe to look on as the
parade marched by

  thief thief ten times a
thief one of the offended family
had spied siiid tomasas earrings in
the ears of the bride but tio sento
only smiled with what seemed to be
satisfaction and the company en-
tered the church

  the spectators who remained
outside turned their eyes toward the
tavern across the square dimoni
the clarinet player had made off in
that direction as if the church or-
gan were offering him an unwelcome
competition but who had joined
him there toni el desgarrat-
rags and some of his rowdv
friends the lot of them went to
one of the tables and sat there ex-
changing winks and smiles all the
undesirables in the towm  something
was on foot and the women began
to whisper and talk mysteriously

  but look they were coming out
of the church again  dimoni got up
from his table on the sidewalk and

went back across the square str-
ing up the royal march all tnfe
ragamuffins in christendom seemed
to have come to life from some
where and gathered around the en-
trance almonds almonds
give us our candy

  almonds eh candy eh
tio sento himself began the fusil-
lade and following his example all
the wedding guests the hard
sweets bounded off the harder
heads of the urchins and the scram-
ble started in the dust the bom-
bardment continued all the way
along the street as the bride and
groom were escorted towards their
home

  in front of the tavern marieta
lowered her head and her face grew
pale toni cl desgarrat was sitting-
there tio sento saw him and smiled
in triumph in answer rap con-
tented himself with an indecent
gesture how spiteful of him the
girl thought to bring that touch of
bitterness into her day of pride

  at the old homestead of siiid to-
masa now tio sentos house hot
chocolate was waiting but care-
ful not to eat too much-its onlv
an hour till dinner time  don ju-
lian the notary had raised his voice
of counsel but the throng had
rushed upon the refreshments and
in no time the table in the great hall
wnth room for more than a hundred
chairs had been stripped as clean as
a bare floor

  marieta meanwhile had gone up
to the bridal chamber the bedroom
famous for its expensive grandeur
of which stnd tomasa had been so
proud she w as removing her wed-
ding gowns for something lighter
soon she came back downstairs in
a cool muslin dress her brown arms
bare and the golden pins gleaming
in her bright hair the notary was
chatting with the priest who had
io

just arrived the guests had gone
out into the yard where they tended
to gather toward the kitchen to
watch the last preparations for the
great banquet dimoni was playing
his clarinct to the limit of his lung-
power the mob of urchins was
shouting and capering outside and
scrambling for the handfuls of al-
monds that were thrown out

   not even belshazzar had such a
feast was the priests comment as
he tookhis seat at table and the no-
tary not to be outdone in erudition
referred to the wedding banquet of
a fellow named camacho that he
had read about in some book or
other for the notary did not know
for sure whether cervantes was a
deputy in parliament or a prophet
in the bible for the less distin-
guished guests there were other ta-
bles in the yard with these di-
moni had taken his place and he was
sending the waiter time after time to
fill his glass with red wine

  all eyes were fastened on the
large pots in which quarters of
chicken were almost as numerous as
the grains of rice in the sauce that
covered them and for once in
their lives those peasants were eat-
ing like senores - not fishing in a
common pot but each with a plate
and a glass of his own and a napkin
into the bargain rustic courtesy
meanwhile was at its best do try
this second joint friend would cry
to friend over the length of the
table and the viand would be for-
warded from hand to hand till it
reached its destination then a bow
and a smile of acknowledgment-as
though each one did not already
have in his plate a piece just like the
one he was being offered

   marieta sitting at her husbands
side was eating with scant appetite
her face was pale and painful
thoughts kept flitting in wrinkles

across her brow nervously she
kept her eyes on the door as it toni
el desgarral might appear there at
any moment that rascal was ca-
pable of anything how bitterly he
had reproached her that night when
she had bidden him good-bye foi
ever she would have reason to
remember him-and repent of her
selfishness in marrying for money 
so he had said but in spite of her
fear she felt a certain satisfaction in
the desgarrats jealousy he loved
her and it was pleasant to think
of that-now that he was lost be-
yond recall

  the meal was beginning to bright-
en by the time the stews were
gone and the roasts were vanishing
down those voracious throats rough
jests and practical jokes were enliv-
ening the festival some of the
guests were warming to the wine
and their loosened tongues were ven-
turing on witticisms at the expense
of bride and bridegroom that
brought roars of satisfied laughter
from tio sento and blushes of em-
barrassment to marietas brown
face

  at dessert marieta arose took a
plate in her hand and began to go
around the table pin-money for the
bride pera agulletes she made
her appeal in her babyish voice and
doubloons half doubloons gold
coins of every denomination began
to drop into it especially from the
relatives of the groom who wanted
him to remember them in his will

  only two pesetas came from the
priest with the excuse that the
church could do no more in such days
of liberalism

  at the end of her round marieta
poured the coins from the plate into
her pocket with a clinking of metal
that was a delightful thing to hear

  and now the banquet had become
a banquet indeed everyone was
a wedding serenade

talking at the same time people
on the outside had come up to the
windows to watch the merry throng
 bomba bombaaa 

  at this signal for a toast the
company fell silent tor a moment
the wag of the company rose un-
steadily to his feet

    a toast to the bride

  a toast to the groom

  invite me next time-it theres
     room

  and the company as though the
labored joke had not been old in
the days of their grandfathers
roared their applause

  and thereupon everyone in turn
to his feet with a couplet a jest at
the expense of the happy couple
jests that rapidly degenerated in
tone till the priest thought it best
to take flight upstairs where the
women had gathered in a separate
parlor

  then someone in a moment of
uncontrollable joy thought of smash-
ing his glass on the table this was
the signal for a general bombard-
ment the guests broke all the
dishes on the floor then began to
throw bits of bread cakes almonds
lozenges and finally fragments of
china at tto sento

  enough of this enough i say
the bridegroom called when the ioke
had gone too far enough of this
but the men were hot with wine
and the joy of combat they re-
doubled their assault the priest
and the women came hurrying down
the stairs in great alarm protesting
at such frenzied gayety

  quiet was finally restored but
they had no more than sat down
again when the women began to
jump up screaming that somebody
was pinching them on the ankles
it was the children who had slipped
in hunting for the remains of the
battle under the table little devils

  out of here out jsay
roared tio sento

  what a good time

v

about ten oclock the guests
from the outlying districts
began to drive off singing at
the top of their voices and wishing
the couple a happy future later
the townspeople went out into the
dark streets the women steering
their tottering husbands along the
uneven sidewalks the notary who
for some time had been sound asleep
in a corner his glasses on the tip of
his nose for once was awakened by
his secretary and dragged out
through the front door only the
near relatives of the two families
were left

  good-bye my child marietas
mother was crying adiosn one
would have thought from her ap-
parent sorrow that the child was on
her way to the grave

  not so the teamster with more
than enough wine to his portion he
was in a jocular mood and kept pro-
testing at his wifes gloom you
didnt fare so badly when i carried
you off did you old girl  finally
he tore her loose from her daughter
and dragged her still weeping to-
ward the door

  tia pascuala the servant went
off to her garret room i he special
waiters and cooks hired for the oc-
casion had already gone home the
house fell silent tio sento and ma-
rieta were alone seated in the disor-
dered banquet room which was still
brightly lighted bv the many candles

  they sat for a long time in silence
-tio sento admiring his conquest
how pretty she looked in her mus-
lin dress nestling in the big chair
and how small what a fate to
be tied forever to that old fool
marieta was thinking as the image


world fiction

of toni el desgarrat hung fixedly
before her mind

   a bell struck in the distance
eleven oclock said tio sento
he rose from his chair put out the
candles in the banquet room and
with a single light in his hand ob-
served 

   it is time to go to bed

   they had just entered the great
bedroom when tto sento stopped

  the whole neighborhood seemed
suddenly to turn into a pandemo-
nium of noise as though the call for
the last judgment had suddenly de-
scended upon bcnimushn a ter-
rible beating of tin cans a wild rat-
tling of hundreds of cow-bells a
beating of boards and sticks a fusil-
lade of pebbles against the side of
the house and a flare of rocket after
rocket up from the ground under
the very windows of the bedroom

  the meaning of it all flashed
through tio sentos mind

  yes i know who is at the bot-
tom of this if it werent for jail
id settle that fellow in a jiffy
marieta wrho had first been
frightened by the infernal uproar
now burst into tears her friends
had warned her  you are marry-
ing a widower so of course therell
be a serenade  

   and a serenade it was indeed af-
ter the first burst of noise came sug-
gestive couplets followed by ap-
plause and laughter songs sung to
the tune of a clarinet with refer-
ences to the age the prowess and
the grotesqueness of the bride-
groom allusions to the past of ma-
rieta predictions as to her future
fidelity to her decrepit husband a
hoarse voice that marieta well rec-
ognized boasted of past relations
with the bride

  you swine you curs tio
sento roared and he stamped up
and down the bedroom beating the

air with his fists as if he were tryinp
to kill that withering sarcasm on
the wing

  a morbid curiosity came over
him he must see who the jail-
birds were to take such liberties with
him he blew out the candle and
peered out into the street from un-
der a corner of the curtain

   the whole village seemed crowd-
ed into the front yard a score or
more of torches blazed along the
sidewalk throwing everything into
a livid glow but in the front line
stood toni cl dasgarrat and all the
relatives of siiid tomasa and
among them among them dimoni
the clarinet player the man who all
that day had been enjoying the hos-
pitality of tio sentos house even
now probably he had in his pockct
the two dollars he had received at
eight oclock the traitor the in-
decent wretch  he was probably
the author of most of those couplets

   tto sento felt the work of a life-
time slipping through his fingers
was he not the leading man in
town  yet there they all were
watching his disgrace enjoying it
taking liberties with him because he
had seen fit to marry a pretty girl
and his blood boiled within him
the blood of the tried cacique
trained to ruling a political district
and accustomed to having his will
obeyed

   there was another burst of noise
with pans and rattles and cow-bells

  then rags bawded another
couplet on beauty and the beast fol-
lowing it with a funeral dirge on
no sentos readiness for the grave

    gori gori gorif  chanted the
multitude taking up this word from
the lament of the dead that toni
had used for a refrain

   the rascal meanwhile had spied
tto sentos face at the window he
picked something up from the
a wedding serenade

ground and camc forward into the
yard it was a pair of huge horns
fastened to the end of a stick he
held it up toward the window
other men advanced carrying a
coffin and in it an effigy with
grotesque eyebrows yards long

  blind with rage and humiliation
lio sento drew back he felt his
way along the walllkpf the dark
room found his shotgun and went
back to the window he raised the
curtain and then the sash almost
without aiming he fired first one
barrel and then the other

  there was a reat surge in the
throng then a mighty shout of ter-
ror and anger the torches went
out there were sounds of flight in
all directions then cries

  assassin murder sento did
it murder thief kill him
kill him

  tio sento however did not hear
he was standing in the middle of
the room the smoking gun in his
hands quite beside himself unable

to collect his thoughts marieta
had collapsed in terror on the floor

  now will you shut up now
will you shut up  he kept murmur-
ing

there came a sound of tramping
feet and a loud knock at the door

open in the name of the law

  tio sento came out of his stupor
the door was thrown open a squad
of policemen came into the room
their hobnails grating on the pol-
ished floor

  as tio sento went out into the
yard between two officers he saw a
body lying on the ground it was
toni el desgarral riddled like a
sieve not a slug had gone to waste

  tonis friends gathered round
with drawn knives among them di-
moni who kept striking out at tio
sento with his clarinet

  but the officers held the mob off
tio sento walked along between
them sunk anew in his stupor

in the middle of the vast som-
bre plain central junction
stuck up rigid and incongru-
ous the town seemed to have
been dropped into the heart of the
gray motionless seas from the blue
unwinking sky its prim uniform-
ity was however kansan rather
than celestial all streets were
straight parallel and equidistant
all stores had flat roofs and pressed-
brick fronts all houses concrete
walks and golden oak front doors
all churches magenta stained-glass
windows and fret-sawed porticos

  the citizens of central junction
were uniform they could not be
distinguished from the citizens of
any small town nor even from each
other nothing marked the indi-
vidual save imperceptibly fine shades
of relative obscurity central junc-
tion had no drunks no catholics no
negroes no beauty and no brains
and it contemplated all these de-
ficiencies with equal complacency

  of this primitive tribal village
mr wilmer scabes was head man
he had lived there all his life it
was he often said good enough for

him and neither he with a webbed
hand spread impressively on his
slack paunch nor his ring of moon-
faced auditors caught any glimmer
of the dreadful implication

  his life moved in a fixed orbit be-
tween his chocolate-colored resi-
dence and his rectangular grocery
though he held no office the heavy
power of his righteousness con-
trolled the town on his solemn
daily round he often paused to dis-
pense weather remarks and aphor-
isms among such citizens as crossed
his churning bows then passed on a
stately caravel freighted with great
thoughts and left their shallow
minds churning like midges in his
wake at such times his formless
face and body radiated a faint and
heatless effulgence as does the firefly
by day and like the fireflys the
emanation was purely mechanical

  small wonder that twenty years
leadership of central junctions un-
colored life had made his gracious-
ness both conscious and perfunctory
not that mr scabes was discontent
on the contrary he was buoyed by
the knowledge of his rectitude a


the flat town



knowledge as precise as his monthly
statement of bills receivable if
there were greater happiness than
this he often told himself he had
not heard of it and yet his light
blue eyes even in the midst of
weighty affairs would sometimes
leave the speakers face and gaze
disconsolately afar they narrowed
and brightened with a flash of un-
gnessed fire as though seeking new
horizons their lustre swiftly fad-
ed as they met nothing but the flat
town and the flat plain beyond

  they wandered even now as mr
scabes stood on the street discussing
the new water-works with mr pod-
ginson the mayor he heard mr
podginsons dry windy voice

  men to put up the reservoir
tank came today dont like their
looks hard young fellers aint done
nothing out of the way yet but i
expect they will

  he heard no more though he was
just conscious of the continued vibra-
tion of mr podginsons chin-whis-
kers and of his melancholy reiter-
ation waer-works-waer-works
like the harsh cry of some persistent
and idiotic fowl mr scabes was
not listening not even thinking he
was just slipping away for an instant
from mr podginson from town af-
fairs from his own level life of fifty
years he did this often of late and
it worried him a man at his age
a leading citizen should settle down
all his people had been well thought
of all except that woman his grand-
father had married jacqueline her

name was heathenish or papish

  here they come now mr pod-
ginson was prodding him with a
meagre elbow

 who oh ah

  three youths in jumpers lounged
with calculated unconsciousness
along the sidewalk each had a cap
of extreme design raked over one
eye and a cigarette cocked in the cor-
ner of a saturnine mouth as they
passed one indicated mr podgin-
son by a nod and murmured uncle
joshuay in an explanatory tone
mr podginson turned on them a
cold and outraged eye and encoun-
tered three dry grins

  it wras clear that these youths
boded central junction no good

  and yet at first their behavior was
passably restrained wilmer scabes
as in duty bound stepped out daily
to watch their progress each
morning he took up a position at a
dignified distance and gazed upon
them with a mien which he conceived
to be benevolently austere they
gathered their material plates
beams kegs of rivets and tackle on
the ground in admirable professional
silence marred only by an unneces-
sarily aggressive technique in expec-
toration they watched the local
concrete manpour the footings with
sombre fixed stares offensive chief-
ly in what they might leave unex-
pressed

  but as the superstructure rose and
they with it their spirits rose as
well and they were not spirits of a
sort which commended themselves


world fiction

to wilmer scabes sitting in his
grocery he could hear the hammer-
ing of rivets the crash of i-beams
and occasional shouts as the work
proceeded the character of these
shouts became clear they were
oaths and scandalous epithets they
rang through the drowsy grocery
more resonant more impious more
shameless each day that the three
hard young men mounted nearer
heaven and looking out of the
window mr scabes saw that every
word fell plummeting like an obscene
bird of prey upon the shrinking
town housewives passed grim
virtue on their blanched adamantine
faces and an alert ear cocked to the
skies for the three youths strange
blasphemies two church members
their bulging eyes upcast stood
transfixed at the sound of familiar
words in unbelievable juxtaposition
horace the grocery boy shut off the
engine of the delivery car and lis-
tened with a scared grin mr
scabes cleared his resounding throat
ominously and cast on horace a
baleful look the grin vanished
horace cranked her fervently and
drove off

  the character of the three erect-
ing men was manifest mr scabes
gave up visiting the water tower
a man in his position could not af-
ford to stand in the presence of evil
the waterworks for which he had
striven had long since become dis-
tasteful and he should have been
glad of a reason to dismiss them
he was disturbed to find however
that instead of welcoming the chance
to do so he now felt a horrid attrac-
tion towards the scene of this loud
and forbidden dialogue though
powerfully reinforced by his sense
of moral rectitude he missed his
daily visit more and more he even
found degrading solace in the fact
that entire escape from contamina-

tion was impossible for there was
in central junction no haven from
the pervasive and ringing indecen-
cies of the three youths poised above
it they penetrated the utmost re-
cesses of central junction and of
mr scabes grocery

  at the wednesday prayer meeting
he pressed his brow against the back
of the pew in front of him and fixed
his eyes on the intricate vermicelli
pattern of the red carpet he was
framing his thoughts in ponderous
phrases standing up he regarded
through half-closed lids the rows of
black backs inclined in prayer then
lifted a sonorous voice to supplicate
that the godless strangers now in
their midst might be led into paths
of grace he sat down to the ap-
proving rustle of bombazine a
hymn followed rescue the perish-
ing he was the leader of the sing-
ing in preparation he drew his chin
into his white bow tie and expanded
his gills like a cobra about to strike
then in a ringing baritone of great
power he hit the first note with
deadly accuracy and swung the do-
cile congregation into the tune

  on his way home he passed the
three unregenerates propped negli-
gently against the drug-store whist-
ling a vulgar melody through their
teeth the swing of their music
quickened his unwilling steps in
the quiet side street the whistling
sounded faint and died away he
walked more slowly rejoicing that
he had never used his own voice save
in the service of the lord

  the sinful trio were now a charge
upon his conscience he tended the
grocery absently his well-lobed ears
on wait for the next impiety to float
in thnough the door the toll grew
not a corroding syllable was forgot-
ten worse than the actuality were
the shouts and snatches of song
whose words were lost in a gust of
the flat town



wind or a clash of steel l pon such
obscurities the anxious mr scabes
spent hours of horrid conjecture

  the tower mounted higher the
three hard youths swinging between
prairie-sea and sky like demi-gods
cast off magnificently all restraint
the sober tat-tat of their pneumatic
riveters gave place to barbarous
rhythms of their own design they
executed double shuffles on the pre-
carious footways they halooed un-
speakable indecencies to each other
across the void they joined uproari-
ously in songs of coarse mirth

  the sheet steel sections of the
tank itself like huge black orange
peels were hoisted up and riveted
together within this ringing bowl
rhe three celestial scalawags aban-
doned themselves to song

  they sang shes a rose with a
broken stem and other tender bal-
lads they sang most scandalous-
ly pull for the shore sailor
with a double syncopated accompani-
ment of pneumatic jacks they sang
the captain went below and the
lurid hot boy and then at the
close of day they executed a volun-
tary or fanfare on the riveters fol-
lowed by a long harmonious o-o-
---h which fixed the attention of
the pavid and expectant town

  o-o-o-o-o-h they sang she-e-
e-e ripped and she snorted and she

rolled on the floor- and right

on through to the outrageous and un-
speakable climax they ended with
a defiant tat-tiddy-tat-tat-tat-tat
of the hammers and quit work

  as the days went on this unvary-
ing evening song became for mr
scabes a sort of diabolic angelus
when the hour approached he
stopped work and anxiously took a
post of vantage then came the
long o-o-o-o-h he pursed his
lips but his eyes were bright across
the street mr podginson raised his

distracted whiskers to the sky
throughout the town indoors and
out the citizens remained with rigid
faces and straining eyes till the last
dreadful note died away

  one evening as the familiar final
tat-tiddy-tat-tat sounded mr
scabes at the grocery door was
swaying toe and heel to the rhythm
he became conscious of mr pod-
ginsons astonished eye and hastily
withdrew he had made himself
ridiculous and even under suspicion
before mr podginson he would
be much better occupied in bringing
the three pagan mechanics to a con-
viction of sin than in shuffling his
feet to their flaunting song he
would sternly check this insult to
central junction too long endured
he would show them there was one
place where ribaldry could not lift
its head and he would place him-
self in the right light with mr pod-
ginson

  at four oclock next afternoon
when high above the town satans
chorus was swelling to full power
wilmer scabes approached the
watertank with mr podginson and
a group of sober citizens by his side
his gaze struggled up through the
flooding din to the tiny figures at its
source

  young men he called in pre-
cise and ringing accents they
roared on oblivious he raised his
voice his words w-ere smothered
by the chattering jacks and the rivet-
ers gross song the position was
ridiculous waving his fcllow-citi-
zens to keep their places he began
as majestically as possible to climb
the tall ladder to the tank

  the group at the base of the tow-
er saw against the sunset the black
and shapeless figure of mr scabes
slowly ascending the long steel web
as he mounted through the volume


world fiction

of harmony his steps quickened un-
til they were in time and in time to
a melody of no righteous import
he was seen to gain the summit
the music stopped they saw six
large mechanics hands reach down
and haul him to safety mr scabes
sat there silent breathless no doubt
they saw the three pariahs steady
him on his perch familiarly and point
across the plain into the blazing
west where the arkansas river lay
then eastward to the ozarks hid
from the groundlings under the
shoulder of the world they saw mr
scabes stand up holding by their
arms and swing the compass round
till his hat old face glowed again

in the flaming western fire waiting
below they felt the swift advance
of twilight and the earth-creeping
evening chill and still mr scabes
did not speak only stared into the
heart of the distant prairie light at
last they saw the four heads come
together the message was being
given then upon their upturned
taces descended a long o-o-o-o-o-
o-h she-e-e ripped and she snorted

and she rolled on the floor-

  they looked to see the apostle
turn and strike the singers down
instead he only sat there rapt and
radiant gazing into the eye of the
sinking sun gently swinging his heels
in rhythm

ttell mr magistrate
 what do you say to this
and maitre cantelme
as he entered the room of his friend
judge pingre pulled out of his pock-
et two thousand franc notes and
shook them with an ironic gesture
before the magistrates face

  you have recovered your
money the latter questioned in his
phlegmatic manner so it wasnt
stolen from you after all

  yes indeed it was stolen from
me the notary replied but it was
returned to me by a   

  a    insisted pingre
then it was not your junior clerk
it was my junior clerk   
i was right in suspecting him you
see and you were wrong in defend-
ing him an old notary can be clev-
erer than a criminal court judge

ha ha

  and a smile of pride lighted up
his mouth and his eyes that soon was
chased away by an expression of
sadness

  anthcme cantelme was a man of
fifty years thick-set and square like
a true auvergnat with large feat-

ures that revealed a not too remote
peasant origin his bearing and
positive manner betrayed also the
bourgeois who has grown up and
been nourished in long-established
surroundings these surroundings
were his office he had lived there
even as a small child his father hav-
ing been employed there as chief
clerk he had been a clerk himself
then having married the daughter
of his employer he had very na-
turally inherited the business he
had taken his profession seriously
and to confirm the fact that one of
the young men employed in his of-
fice could have committed a theft
was very painful to him after hav-
ing for a moment triumphed in one
of those professional rivalries such
as exist between friends of allied
professions he gave way to a more
generous feeling

  all the same he added i
should have preferred you to be
right

was only a half auvergnat his
father of provencal origin who had
come to clermont as a professor of
the faculty had married there he
had died there and his widow re-
mained in the city their son hon-
orat had himself married a girl of
riom a relative of the cantelmes
he had let himself be appointed
magistrate in the ancient city of
limagne on account of his wife and
his mother he had lost them one
after the other but on account of
his relations he had remained in
riom which he never intended to
leave his southern origin showed
in his brown eyes in his black hair
scarcely grizzled and in something
inexpressible something finer more
alive in his profile and in his build
the look of the room where this
dialogue had taken place showed
that this son of a toulonnais and
of a mountain daughter of the midi
cherished a peculiar love for his
mothers country shelves of wood
along the walls held an enormous
collection of minerals the fruit of
his many geological expeditions
this museum with the labels care-
fully glued on all the stones re-
vealed method carried to meticulous-
ness and the tone in which he
corrected the assertion of his visi-
tor had that dryness which the habi-
tude of pronouncing judicial deci-
sions gives

  i told you he insisted that
when you tried to incriminate that
boy you were arguing from insuffi-
cient data which required a more
careful examination the moment
that he restores the money every-
thing has changed but how did
you get this confession from him af-
ter he had denied the theft so obsti-
nately did you see him again

  not him his mother you
remember that after the disappear-
ance of the two thousand francs

moreufl did not come back to the
office giving sickness as a pretext
at least i thought that it was a prel
text it was one more reason for
me to suspect him 

  and for me to doubt interupt-
ed the judge that sudden ab-
sence it was much too maladroit
let us consider the facts again
you leave your study to escort a cli-
ent to the street you leave your
keys in a draw-er of your desk in
which you have just shut up two
packages of bank notes which this
client had brought your second
clerk is alone busy in die adjoin-
ing room he is quite familiar with
the business your client had with
you he knows that you must have
received this money he does not
hear you go out he enters your
study to hand you the papers he has
been copying you are not there
he goes to put these papers on the
desk he notices the bunch of keys
you imagine he opens the drawer
he is tempted he takes two notes
of a thousand francs out of the ten
which are in the two bundles you
see him five minutes later pass by
you on the sidewalk where you are
still talking he shows no sign of
agitation that all points to a thief
but he cant help knowing that he
will be suspected yet he no longer
acts like a thief when he does not
come back under the childish pre-
text of a feigned illness that would
amount to giving himself away at
once   

  just so replied the notary
and he would certainly have come
back    but it so happens the ill-
ness was not feigned i told you
about my visit to question him i
told you that i found him in bed
looking frightfully ill it may be it
was from the emotion caused by my
visit the fear of being discovered
and convicted in spite of his denials

poor boy- pity him in spite of his
crime-was delirious for two hours
and in his delirium he denounced
himself thief i thief he cried
i have stolen    two thousand
francs  the drawer   
there were twenty notes there are
eighteen left    prison   
the court    the guillotine
   these were the words he
never stopped repeating and he
went through the scene of the theft
before his poor mother who was
nursing him what an experience
after he had had the effrontery to
call her that he might swear to me
his innocence before her you re-
call this

   so it was a farce said pingre
 was he counting on the regard
we all have for madame moreuil
and which she deserves you will
see in the face of this confession
all the more indisputable as it was
completely involuntary she did not
hesitate this morning her son fell
asleep a neighbor offered to look
after him the good woman took
advantage of this to come to me at
once to bring me these two notes
and to beg me when gervais recov-
ers- if he recovers - not to de-
nounce him that would be impos-
sible of course since she has made
restitution i could promise her to
keep the matter an absolute secret

i	have kept it at your advice from
my wife and son as for you    
a magistrate is a confessor so
now the affair is over-or nearly
there is one more thing to be done
shall i keep this boy in my office
i shant persuade you to said
the judge

  yet when you advised me not to
prefer a charge against him what
arguments did you use that i

would ruin his future if he were in-
nocent and if the real culprit were
not discovered on account of the
suspicion which would always attach
to him and you added if he is
guilty it is a first offence his con-
duct has been irreproachable up to
now he may repent and become
an honest man  

  doubtless replied pingre
quickly one fact was unknown to
me then one which you have just
given me his meanness duly con-
firmed this time to get his mother
to cover his theft you pictured
him to me on the contrary as a de-
voted son anxious to get on as quick-
ly as possible in order to give his
mother more comforts that was
your explanation of his theft to
your knowledge he had before this
dabbled in stocks through a com-
rade employed in the riomoise
branch of the grand comptoir you
imagined that he had let himself be
tempted by some stock that was on
the point of going up and that he
had taken the two thousand francs
with the idea that a final effort
would make it possible for him to
purchase the practice at volvie
which is about to be sold my ad-
vice was based on this hypothesis
but the swindler who the moment
he is caught has the audacity as you
say to make his mother intervene
for him is an arrant rascal   
no no dont keep him if i were
in your place i wtould even make
my silence conditional on his choos-
ing a profession where he wont have
funds to handle

  you are right said the notary
after a moment    for his
mothers sake i will find an excuse
for his leaving the office which wont
excitc remarks    but he wont
be easy to replace i that very af-
ternoon before he committed the
theft he was finishing up the work


world fiction

of the head clerk filing papers which
the other had left when he went off
to amuse himself in the cafe
those diligent hypocrites are
the worst said the judge  youd
better be glad that he is unmasked
next autumn your son will have
finished his legal studies you can
give him gervais moreuils place
and above all no sentimentality
about this young brigand who has
not even the merit of a confession to
his credit he was talking in his
delirium profit by this occasion to
insist that edmund must not fail in
his examinations since you will
have need of him before you ex-
pected

forty - eight hours after
this conversation the t w o
friends met again in the judges
same study when the notary ar-
rived he found him studying pencil
in hand a large map painted in dif-
ferent colors which represented the
geological section of the depart-
ment between the chain of the puys
and that of the forez the paper
was striped with marks of the cor-
rections mads by the mineralogist
judge on the boundaries of the dif-
ferent formations he received his
friend tapping with his finger on
one underlined spot with the
phrase

  and they didnt recognize the
volcanic pliocene there

  then he laughed heartily i
beg your pardon artheme i was
talking hebrew to you but for a
man whose business is the taking of
evidence this which goes back for
thousands and thousands of years
is absorbing one is surer of it than
of human testimony

  i bring you a proof of that
said the notary this time i have
come to prefer a charge i have

quite made up my mind

  against whom and for what
gervais moreuils mother has made
restitution  

  she did make restitution can-
telme corrected him seeing me
so good-natured she and her son
doubtless have been thinking things
over they thought that i was sim-
ply a fool in short i saw that
woman land at my house this morn-
ing completely changed as aggres-
sive and insolent as she was humble
day before yesterday she is the ac-
complice of her rascal of a son thats
all   

  madame
m o r e u i  

but you told
me yourself

   i never
knew her
before this
m o r n i n g

she came
into my
study with a face that i call black i
thought that her son was worse on
the contrary he is much better she
replied to my question she told
me that his delirium had fallen with
his fever that the boy had recovered
his senses that he had asked her
what had happened about the theft
committed in the office and if the
guilty one had been discovered she
was astounded-i am giving you her
testimony he insisted she told
him that he had confessed all in his
delirium then-these are still her
words-he showed an extraordinary
emotion he affirmed that he had
not the slightest recollection of the
words he had pronounced 

then followed a preposterous story
he demanded a priest received the
communion and then alone with his
mother swore to her the wafer
scarcely off his tongue that he had
a false confession



had nothing to do with this theft
that he had placed his papers on
my desk without even seeing that
the keys were in the drawer he
begged me to come and swear to his
innocence his mother concluded
 and i have come 

   and you said to her 

   oh very simple while she was
reciting to me this astonishing story
i was thinking you are regretting
that you restored the two thousand
francs to me in a moment of panic
i knew the way to verify her sin-
cerity  offer to give back to her those
two thousand francs while not hid-
ing from her the fact that i con-
tinued to believe her son guilty
and madame moreuil did she
take the two thousand francs
yes indeed and with what an
air  this money belongs to us
monsieur she said i took it from
my poor savings and brought it to
you without hesitating when i
thought we owed it to you i take
it back without hesitation now that
you owe it to us in the face of
such impudence i was seized with
anger i said to her very well
madame you take back your
money i take back my liberty i
shall place this case in the hands of
justice she seemed quite moved
then pulling herself together as
you will monsieur and then she
left counting evidently on my kind-
ness on my old affection for her son
on my fear of a scandal touching the
personnel of my office she is mis-
taken oh how right you were day
before yesterday when you called
this young moreuil a fearful hypo-
crite there was reason for it you
see

   so it is no longer to his friend
pingre that maitre cantelme has
come to talk but to the magistrate
now let us make out this charge in
due and proper form

   clearing his desk of all the mincr-
alogical documents he prepared
paper and a pen and said to the no-
tary motioning him to an arm
chair

  sit down there i am going to
dictate the document to you

  cantelme sat down and the judge
began to walk up and down the room
while he reflected then stopping
in front of the desk

  all the same its a little queer
that this woman should have accept-
ed the money knowing her son was
guilty

  thats all she came for said
cantelme

  that may be but with the idea
that you would believe her when she
would say to you  my son spoke
in a delirium he was out of his
head and his confession doesnt
count you dont believe her if
she was fooling you what should
she do she should play the role
just as the person you had imagined
would act innocent and proud one
whom suspicion would revolt in-
stead of that there was her claim
set forth in a haughty manner the
taking back of the money even at
the risk of a trial the dignity of her
departure

  you might say the cynicism
madame moreuil a cynic   
well anything may happen since
little gervais moreuil the son of
poor moreuil such a good man has
stolen by the by were there any
other witnesses of this confession
you told me that doctor pacotte
was called in

  the crisis was that night i
dont knowr whether pacotte was
there or not    but i cant spend
my morning pondering on the sin-
cerity or insincerity of madame
moreuil t have too much work at
the office with only two clerks cred-
it her if you like with good faith


world fiction

and believe that she is the dupe of
her son  dont think so and i
want an indictment what do i
write

  what i am going to dictate to
you

  when the document had been
written the judge took it and began
to read it half under his breath lay-
ing weight in spite of himself on
the words against one unknown
sign here he concluded all
right i will do what is necessary
i havent been out this morning
wait for me i will walk home with
you

iii

maitre cantelme lived
in an old mansion like many
to be found in riom built
of black stones of volvic with high
windows with inner shutters above
the carved door the professional
signs took on the appearance of
a coat of arms the ground floor
was reserved for the office the
apartments of the first floor for the
living quarters those of the sec-
ond floor were used by the daughter
of the notary whose husband was an
engineer in the north when she
came with her children to spend the
holidays in riom when he came to
his doorstep the judge instead of
leaving his friend accompanied him
into his study as if to continue the
conversation doubtless he had
another idea in his head because he
had scarcely entered the room the
scene of the theft of the two thou-
sand francs than he asked pointing
to the desk

  in which drawer did you lock
the package of bank notes the other
day before you escorted your client
out of the room to the street 

   in the top one to the right
said the notary  but why 

   then it would be possible to

see through the window that the
keys were in the drawer the judge
replied  was that window -
and he pointed to it- open or
shut 

   do not remember said can-
telme

    lets see it was last tuesday
it was very fine weather that day
but fearing the humidity on account
of rheumatism you had lighted the
fire as to-day 

   k without a doubt

   you must have been too warm
and as that is a west window and
sunny at that hour you must have
opened it to give you air

   probably what are you driv-
ing at 

   could one climb up easily from
the garden  continued pingre as
if determined not to reply directly to
his friend then going to verify
this himself  the sill is high but
burglars are good gymnasts   
but how did he get into the gar-
den through the house here
is a bell at the door which overlooks
the corridor it would have been
heard    from the outside
there is the rampart thats im-
possible its perpendicular   
well good-by my friend will you
allow me to go into your garden for
a moment 

  to measure the distance from
the parapet to the boulevard  said
the notary laughing  the law is
in possession you have every right
but truly when one has a real con-
fession it is lost time to search for
something else

  then pointing to the heap of
documents

   i wont accompany you you
will excuse me 

    everyone to his last said the
judge

  he went into the garden a long
terrace planted with enormous elms
a false confession

which he was familiar with having
so often sat there to enjoy the air
during the fine mild evenings of the
auvergne summers he continued
to pursue an idea that grew more
and more distinct for he walked
without hesitation towards an arbor
or rather a summer-house in which
the chairs destined to be used in
july were kept in the rainy season
the door closed simply with a latch
pingre opened it noticing that the
hasp was only half caught on the
catch a detail which indicated haste
one of the seats inside was separ-
ated from
the others
set in a row
at the back
it had fal-
len to the
ground an-
other sign
that the per-
son who had
 last been in
the summer-house had been in
a hurry it was a wooden stool
very light and easy to handle
pingre set it up again and with
his handkerchief took the exact
measurements of its feet then
he returned to the lower-floor
window of the notarys study
there he made sure that a man of
his height by drawing himself up a
little could sec the desk where can-
telme now sat busy looking over his
papers standing on a stool of the
height of the one which pingre had
just examined reaching the sill was
if not easy at least possible with a
little effort once on the sill if the
window were open to jump into the
toom would be only play when he
had got this far in his imagination
the judge was astonished to find him-
self repeating below his breath his
question of a short while before

   but how could one get into the

garden from the outside it is im-
possible in broad daylight over a
wall six feet high   through
the house still more impossible

  he took into consideration the
door which opened out on the ter-
race it was at the end of a cor-
ridor which was between the office
and cantelmes study from this
corridor a spiral staircase went up
to the next floor all this was sep-
arated from the entrance vestibule
by a door with a bell it will be re-
membered that pingre had taken
this in at once he thought of it
now again

   the thief could not have en-
tered or gone out without the clerks
hearing him and moreuil was
there    unless    but no
why would moreuil have an accom-
plice if he is up to stealing he has
stolen alone as cantelme believes
   all the same that confession
the communion that revolt of the
mother risking the lawsuit the
restitution settled everything  
that is if    no her attitude
was genuine    genuine   
yes with her on his side there is
still the confession    that must
count a confession cantelme says
well it is a fact the fact it is
as if wre had seen that boy open the
drawer and take the notes to hunt
for anything else is to lose ones
time let us stick to the confession
and let us charge him with the crime
before the proper authorities

  as he was about to leave the gar-
den he lifted up his head mechan-
ically to look at a little turret at
one of the angles of the ancient man-
sion which was one of its peculiari-
ties he noticed that between one
of the slits of this sort of a watch
tower he himself was being watched
by someone who at once drew back
this movement was a very quick one
but not quick enough to prevent

wd-

a
world fiction

pingre from recognizing in the face
pressed against the old greenish
pane that of edmund cantelme his
godson and the son of the notary
the law student home for his easter
vacation this round room was
used as a library the boy was in
it nothing more natural than this
glance into the garden between two
intervals of reading but by an
automatic play of his thoughts the
image of the young man looking at
him and then disappearing so quickly
inserted itself in the web of the
judges reasoning

   why did he go away instead of
opening the window and speaking to
me is he afraid of me 

  in this question was alreadv a
suspicion still indistinct which
grew more definite when the judge
at last left the house it was in
the morning and cantelmes serv-
ant whose wife was the concierge
was just finishing sweeping the vesti-
bule and the pavement he had
been busy at this work when the
notary and the judge had crossed
the threshold twenty minutes earlier

   monsieur edmund has come
in hasnt he  pingre asked him

   a quarter of an hour ago the
man replied

   at the same time as monsieur
cantelme  asked the judge fol-
lowing instinctively an examination
of which however he did not see
the end

   just after you both said the
servant

  a question on the judges lips on
the direction from which he had
come was not spoken he looked
down the street to the left where he
and his friend had been walking a
few minutes before he saw a new
picture in his mind the young man
seeing the silhouettes of his god-
father and his father and walking
more slowly why still guided

by instinct and by irresistible steps
from hypothesis to hypothesis to
an unverified supposition pingre
added another

   why because he was afraid
as when at the window    fear
of what fear of me

  one by one several minor facts
unnoticed at the time came back to
the magistrates memory certain
reserves of edmund since his re-
turn to riom his emaciation
his paleness signs of fatigue which
his indulgent mother had at-
tributed to too great assiduity to
his studies finally during these
last days and especially since the
theft a strange embarrassment
the sudden cessation of his visits
to his godfather when at school
he had shown a pretty talent for
drawing which he had given up
or nearly for years and for which
his infatuation had returned with
the pretext of making some sketches
at first in the suburbs then of an
ancient and celebrated church that
of mozat a suburb of riom he had
disappeared during the morning and
a part of the afternoon these
indications fitted in so well with the
ideas which had flashed into the
mind of the judge that he brought
them together in spite of himself
into a construction at which he was
immediately horrified he liked to
say of himself with a kind of proud
good-nature i am only a crim-
inal court magistrate but i am one
from the top of my head to the soles
of my feet i think as a judge i
feel as a judge i breathe as a judge
i collect as a judge this was to
justify through his profession his
mania of mineralogy  down to
bed-rock everywhere and always
that is my motto he would say
in a leap of intuition he saw ed-
mund in paris tempted by gambling
and losing a big sum which he had
a false confession



promised to pay or contracting
debts for a mistress leaving tor his
vacation with the longing for this
woman and the terror of a debt to
confess then this same edmund in
the garden in front of his fathers
study seeing the keys in the drawer
the notary had the habit when he
received sums of money of shutting
them in his desk if he w-ere busy
not till evening then did he put them
in a safe the son knew of this
habit

    i am dreaming the judge said
to himself as he shook his head now
growing gray in order to exorcise
this nightmare  edmund a thief
no no i no and the confession
of the other the confession the
confession he kept repeating
 what shall i do about it 

   now other pictures came to him
the sick man in his bed imitating the
scene of the theft before his fright-
ened mother then his retraction so
impressive that it had convinced
this woman because to admit as
did cantelme that madame mo-
reuil had been acting a part in her
second visit-to this also pingre
said no and again no his curiosity
was so strongly aroused that he now
hastened his step to get home the
sooner and to put in at once the
notarys charge he could then
proceed to an immediate examina-
tion and learn    but if the
young man were innocent what
a drama this inquiry would be for
him and for his mother  seated
before the bit of paper on which the
notary had written his denunciation
a sudden scrupule seized the judge
he sat there immovable asking
himself if he couldnt find some
means of unravelling this enigma
before letting it go too far gervais
moreuil pretended not to remem-
ber the confession which had slipped
out during his delirium was such

forgetfulness possible this ques-
tion brought another in its train of
general application is it possible
that one in delirium can accuse him-
sell wrongly of an act of which in
his lucid moments he sees himself
suspected 

   i must consult a doctor
thought pingre but which  and
the familiar exclamation of the
auvergnese peasants with whom he
talked in his walks came to his lips
 of course pacotte

iv

a train left at half past ten
the judge had twelve min-
utes to reach the station at
eleven oclock he was at clermont
walking with the brisk step of a
mountaineer towards rue du port
where the old practitioner lived
though he had passed his eightieth
year he was still active due to a
hygiene that had become proverbial
in the city his feet shod in heavy
boots with a triple sole which he
always wore even in the house his
long thin torso clad in a coat of
brown cloth with velvet revers
which was his uniform his small
mobile head of a bald eagle emerg-
ing from a white stock wound twice
below the soft points of his shirt col-
lar his sharp eyes behind his great
round spectacles-this fantastic per-
sonage was just finishing his
frugal noonday repast when pingre
entered

    i see that you have come he
said to the judge  to kill two birds
with one stone it is lecture day at
the academy of clermont and you
profit by that to consult doctor
pacotte if you would eat as he
does you would not have need of
him

  and he pointed to the dish of
macaroni which with his two boiled
eggs dry biscuits or dried fruit


world fiction

made up his almost daily menu
his greeting into which he had put
a flavor of charting good humor was
mitigated by his piercing glance still
more inquisitive when pingre had
replied

   to be sure there is a meet-
ing at the academy  i had
forgotten it

   then laughing himself

    i havent eaten much more than
you to-day

  and in the same tone of jovial
cordiality

    it is not as a patient that i have
rung at your door i have had to
come to clermont on a business of
slight importance as you say the

idea came to
me to kill
two birds
with one
stone i
wanted t o
consult you
about a
piece of
work which
i intend to
communicate to your very academy
pacottes eyes flashed with aston-
ishment which the judge did not fail
to see he had all at once realized
that the doctor whether directly or
indirectly was familiar with the
gervais moreuils case and that he
belonged to the old school which
practices the religion of the secret
confessional there was no doubt
but that he attributed the presence
of his visitor to the real cause no
doubt either but that he would meet
the question regarding the words
pronounced before him by his
patient with the most complete
silence this awoke suddenly in
the magistrate his own professional
pride he too had a secret to keep
since the case had not been opened
and he had not summoned pacotte

either as witness or as expert and
at the same time he had a victory
to win-to make that mouth speak
that in repose was so tightly closed
he had with that curious agility of
imagination belonging to the police
immediately discovered the way
the allusion to the academy of
clermont of which both he and the
old doctor were members had
shown him

   yes he continued  a paper
on evidence

  pacottes pupils had become as
dull as the ground-glass window-
panes which this lover of hygiene
used to temper the light in his
dining room in order to spare his
sight

   good he remarked simply

  it is the turn of you youngsters to
collaborate in our bulletin  
have just finished he continued
 excuse me

  he went into his bedroom with-
out closing the door and pingre
could hear him brushing his teeth
with the conscientiousness he gave
to all the minor details of his health
when he came back he said

   eight times a day morning
evening before and after each of
the three meals    and you
see

  he opened his mouth in a smile
which showed a set of teeth intact
despite his years

   chewing is half of digestion
he added sententiously then opening
another door with a ceremonious
gesture 

   come into my study for your
consultation miette will bring you
coffee real coffee mocha like vol-
taires 

  and when the servant with her
auvergnese bandeau only a little
less aged than her master had put
down on a stand the cups containing
the precious beverage in the study
a false confession



whose high windows looked out on
a cold and sombre garden he said
 just smell this aroma smell it
smell it it isnt either chicory or
beans this coffee has not lost any
of its caffeine    my recipe i
have it roasted in the stove as do
the turks and not in one of your
roasters in which jou cant regulate
the degrees of heat  i do not
offer you anything to smoke be-
tween nicotine and doctor pacotte
there is a mortal antipathy   
sugar cane sugar of course
pure eh i will give you the ad-
dress of the grocer at nantes   
arc you comfortable now as the
english say good now tell me
your business although i dont see
very clearly what light a doctor can
throw upon a subject upon which he
is incompetent   

  then looking pingre in the face
he said

   you are familiar with the hip-
pocratic oath we havent even
the right to break it and to bear wit-
ness when there is a question of a
criminal operation to be punished if
we have gained our knowledge as a
physician

   i know that said the judge
 but my paper is on the critique of
testimony and i am now making a
study of the kind of individuals
whom you call in your psychology
i believe auto-accusers 

  auto-accusation replied pa-
cotte drinking his coffee slowly
that is very simple a morbid per-
son conceives ccrtain melancholy
ideas of ruin vague persecution of
poisoning of dishonor let him con-
sider himself the cause of his own
unhappiness and he comes to the
point of imaginary culpability

   but how may one know if this
culpability is imaginary

   how can one know that a
madman is a madman said the

doctor  by sending him to us
 then the testimony of an auto-
accuser does not count with you 

   no since he is a sick man
speaking in a kind of dream

   but lady macbeth said the
judge  she too talked in a dream
yet she spoke the truth

  a look of reserve passed over
pacottes face and a glance which
signified ail you want in the scien-
tific and literary field my dear pin-
gre all you want but no further
you know

  he put dowrn his cup and walked
over to the bookcase he took out
a volume whose calf binding dated
from the restoration and fingering
its pages said

 let us study this text a bit

  it astonishes you that a
physician should have a copy of
shakespeare you see in our pro-
fession everything is useful 
good here we are

  act v scene -dunsinane a
room in the castle lady macbeth
a waiting gentlewoman the doc-
tor

doctor    infected minds
to their deaf piilows will discharge
their secrets

  what a splendid statement and
which proves the infallible divina-
tion of genius infected-notice
that word an auto-accuser is noth-
ing else than that a brain intoxi-
cated by infectious microbes and
which functions badly

  yet lady macbeth    the
judge insisted

   well lady macbeth is a sick
person who secs on her hand a non-
existing spot of blood

   on account of a crime

   so be it but dont let us go any
further

  after a moment of silence pacotte
again looked directly at the judge
and emphasizing his words said
world fiction

   if i had the right to speak in
an action brought against lady
macbeth and had not attended her
i should say  these phrases
spoken in an attack of delirium
prove one thing only-that a deed
has been done which has made a
violent impression on her confes-
sions made in this state of mental
disorder should be accepted merely
as information regarding the pa-
tients preoccupations    insist
on this point in your paper if you
wish it to be scientific it is through
facts and objectively that evidence
should be checked up

   but in the case of lady mac-
beth pingre insisted  what would
you call the objective verification 

   that which bears on the circum-
stances first of all wras the crime
of which she is accused committed
under the circumstances which make
it seem probable that she took part
in it was it in harmony with her
character to have taken part in it
here is where heredity education
circumstances age and the past
come in does she know that she
is suspected if no the confession
in delirium takes on a enormous
value because then the obsession
emerges from the very depth of her
thought if she does the confession
may become a presumption of inno-
cence it is the proof that she can-
not bear the shame of this accusa-
tion

   it seems to me objected the
judge  that then she ought to pro-
test exactly the contrary

   and what do you make of
delirium the doctor asked it
is a cloudy conglomeration of phan-
toms which envelop the sick person
he no longer distinguishes between
them and himself he becomes these
phantoms when he learns that he
is suspected he pictures vividly to
himself the consequences of these

suspicions he sees himself arrested
tried condemned it is no longer
possible to disassociate his real per-
sonality from that which his accusers
attack and he confesses the crime
which he has not committed do
you remember the witch who was
burned during the middle ages in
clermont about whom our confrere
andre read us such an interesting
paper at the academy she con-
fessed her presence at a witches
sabbath which could not have been
anything but an hallucination that
meant burning alive she knew that
but she was delirious and confessed
to an act which she had never com-
mitted and which caused her death

   the case is very complete
you may say that she retracted
later yes but how declaring
that she had never made this confes-
sion torture couldnt wring a con-
fession out of her the second time
at this you will recall the ancient
chronicler was indignant he did
not know that this total forgetful-
ness is the rule after delirium when
the waiting gentlewoman asked
lady macbeth next morning  how
did the queen sleep  she certainly
replied  very well 

   but would not this forgetful-
ness haze been simulated 

   scarcely possible simulations
of this kind presuppose scientific
knowledge of mental diseases it is
however possible and i return to
my principle the objective search
that of character first of all a de-
ceiver does not deceive only once
 nevertheless characters do
change there is such a thing as a
first crime

   certainly said pacotte  it
is your business to make an objec-
tive search for what astronomers
call  a disturbant the star which
produces a deviation in the orbit of
another star then-he laughed
a false confession

i

his silent little laugh-you need
diagnosis but diagnosis is intelli-
gence in co-ordinating details
when a man tells you that he has
the feeling that his finger is dead
cramps in the calves of his legs
trouble in keeping himself warm
these slight signs do not mean any-
thing to you to me they reveal
nephritis just as surely as if i had
cut my good man up and seen with
my eyes his kidney red hardened
and inflamed

   but he concluded looking at
the clock  it is past noon i must
take my siesta you know that i lie
down for an hour at this time every
day without sleeping at two
oclock i shall be at the lecture at
the academy shall i see you
there 

   no said pingre  i must re-
turn to riom as soon as possible to
finish up an investigation

   thats good said pacotte
 you are like me you think of the
anxiety of your accused just as i
think of that of my patients i never
keep them waiting well good-by
i must make a search in these old
books -and he pointed with his
old wrinkled hand to his book-
cases- to see if i cant find some
good texts for your paper i have
there the two volumes of esquirol
of -and the mcdical-philo-
sophical treatise of pinel of 
they were not written yesterday
but those men were clinicians
and the clinic does not go out of
date that is where is differs from
theories good-by good-bye i
wish you a successful investigation
rapid and just

v

u ihe dear ood man
thought the judge half an
hour later in the train
which was carrying him back to

riom  i made him talk all the
same he thought with a singular
satisfaction  all that he told me
about lady macbeth he was telling
me about gervais moreuil and his
last words successful investigation
rapid and just what can they mean
if not that he does not consider him
guilty and that the confessions of
his delirium simply prove the shock
which his masters accusation pro-
duced  and pingre continued to
repeat to himself  he does not be-
lieve him guilty he is a fine clini-
cian and has insight  i hadnt
been there a minute before he knew
the reason of my visit still
when he talks about confessions
which are not confessions what is
that if not a theory and the most
arbitrary kind of one 

  he felt a growing antagonism
against an affirmation so upsetting
to his mental habits  but let us
accept his theory he concluded
 and let us procede according to
his method objectively and think of
the circumstances as he says he
tried to apply his mind to this
analysis he saw again in imagina-
tion the study of the notary the
desk the drawer then the window
the garden terrace and by an inevi-
table association of ideas edmund
the suspicion that awoke so sud-
denly in him at the disappearance
of the young man now came back to
him was it possible however that
with a character which he his god-
father had always found so loyal
this boy could have robbed his
father but the  disturbant  
what method should he adopt to
bring the truth to light should he
make inquiries about edmunds re-
lations in paris why not about
morcuits speculations on the ex-
change in spite of his affections
his desires even of his resistance to
the physicians suggestion the in-

stinct of the judicial bloodhound was
leading the judge on the right scent
it was necessary to act quickly this
evening to-morrow morning at the
latest cantelme would come back to
ask him how far he had got with his
indictment but why not communi-
cate his suspicions about edmund to
cantelme himself who could make
a search of his sons room yes but
by what right could he merely for
an impression still very vague in-
flict such sorrow such an insult on a
father and then they might not
find the bank notes even if edmund
had stolen them if he had to pay
a pressing gambling debt or content
a grasping mistress as soon as he
had the money it would have been
sent away it was easy to verify
this

  ill go

by the post
office said
p i n g r e to
himself
and ill ask
the postmas-
ter to let me
see the rec-
ord of regis-
tered matter
for this week if edmunds name
is there and he has sent a registered
letter that will be further proof
this project had one advantage
that it meant immediate action the
only relief in crises of wearing un-
certainty the judge decided on it
when he got out of the train he
went straight to the post office in
the rue grenier in front of the post
office he stopped    he did not
enter a sort of professional scruple
again seized and paralyzed him

   until the case has been entered
i have not the right to act as the
examining magistrate to ask the
postmaster for this information is to
ask him to do something illegal

  it meant moreover-but was
pingre conscious of this in the back
of his mind-that it would awaken
the curiosity of the postmaster
whom he knew to be perspicacious
and something of a detective it
meant the risk that when he had
gone those searching eyes would
also consult the records of the regis-
tered mail and that they might
come across the name of edmund
cantelme coupled with the name of
some woman living in the latin
quarter this shrinking from a
mere possibility showed the judge
how much he loved his god-son this
and the change of his ideas which
now made him set out toward the
street in which the moreuils lived
wasnt it better at least for the
present to put aside this suspicion
about his godson which rested only
on an hypothesis and first to run
down the indisputable fact of the
clerks avowal if pacotte did not v
believe in the absolute veracity of
this confession he did not deny its
importance he admitted it was an
indication but of what of excite-
ment to be explained equally by re-
volt and remorse all the same he
had an investigation to make on this
point how ky insisting that the
mother question her son once more
as pingre neared the widows house
he who was usually so determined
in his conduct as a judge felt that
for a second time he was incapable
of going to the limit of his intention

it was too hard the unfortunate
woman must be suffering so again
he stopped as a moment before on
the steps of the post office

   the  disturbant  he thought

 pacotte was right we are all in-
fluenced by them it is the deviation
of the star but if the deviation
makes the line of the orbit swerve
it does not destroy it as i know
edmund even supposing he should
a false confession



have taken the two thousand
francs he is none the less a
good-hearted boy if he were guilty
and knew that his father was sus-
pecting moreuil he couldnt bear it
but if he is guilty he must realize
that his father is trying to find his
two thousand francs and conse-
quently that he is suspecting some-
one    or perhaps he thought
that cantelme would have put the
two bundles of bank notes in his safe
before going upstairs for dinner
and that he would not count them
once in the safe and mixed with the
others when would he notice the
deficit not for several days per-
haps several weeks-too late he
would have to put the missing sum
down to profit and loss as they say
yes that was the secret of ed-
munds calmness    his calm-
ness while waiting he shuns us
all he is afraid let him learn
that an innocent person will be
accused - and his honour will
awaken if he is guilty from that
line no  disturbant  will make him
deviate    but is he guilty i
shall read it in his eyes as soon as i
talk to him-because i am going to
talk to him

  and already he was on the way
through die suburb past the old
church of mozat the ruins of a
benedictine abbey where are to be
found the famous reliquaries of st
calmin and st austremont twenty
minutes walk and he was in front
of the portico with its twelfth-cen-
tury arch he was disappointed not
to find the young man drawing
there were those sketching hours
in the venerable riom sanctuary
only an alibi pingre walked all
round the church still nothing he
entered the roman capitals of the
interior might have tempted the stu-
dents pencil    edmund can-
telme was there copying one of the

strangest of them which repre-
sented naked men riding goats the
sound of the newcomers steps on
the pavement made him lift his
head and he recognized his god-
father he grew pale then
blushed so violendy that it was only
too much in keeping with his retreat
from the window a few hours be-
fore he had received a shock the
judge also this pallor and those
blushes were the evidence but he
wanted to doubt still longer more-
over the evidence was not enough
the proof was needed

   i did not know i should find
you he began  lets see your
drawing and in a kindly tone
he said  but its not bad at all
you are right to love this solid
roman auvergnat    they have
spoiled this church a little by cover-
ing the central nave with a gothic
vaulting what artists those un-
known architects of the middle ages
were it is here or to ennezat
that i walk when i want to district
my thoughts from real worries
to-day i have a big one do you
guess what it is 

   no said the young man bend-
ing again over his sketch but his
hand trembled a little and broke the
point of his pencil on the paper

   what ytour father hasnt told
you  

   what  edmund asked

   about what happened last
tuesday he was robbed in his
study at half past five in the after-
noon a client brought him twenty
thousand francs in two packages of
one thousand franc notes pinned to-
gether he put these packages in
the right-hand drawer of his desk
and went out with his client forget-
ting that he had left the keys in the
drawer they talked for some time
and walked a hundred steps along
the street for a quarter of an hour


world fiction

perhaps your father came back
took up the bank notes to put them
in the safe he had counted them
with his client he counted them
again almost by chance absent-
mindedly there were only eigh-
teen now there was only one per-
son who had been into the room
one person only  

   who 

   the second clerk

  gervais moreuil asked ed-
mund in a choking voice  is he
suspected 

    he is not suspected the judge
corrected  he is known to be
guilty he had stayed in the office
alone i tell you after his comrades
had left to file some documents
while your father and his client
were talking in the street he entered
the study to put those documents on
the desk then when he left the
house he did not stop to tell your
father that he had finished his work
and we know that he had gambled
on the exchange if he had not
fallen ill at once with typhoid fever
he would be in prison already

  in prison repeated the stu-
dent who no longer pretended to be
drawing

   yes your fathers charge
against him is in my hands i am
holding it only on account of that
fever in order to spare the invalid
an emotion which might be fatal to
him and to his poor mother but
when he has recovered-law comes
first doesnt it would you believe
it at my age after so many years
of this i ought to be hardened to
emotions of this sort well im
not i am miserable yes miserable

i do not exaggerate at the thought
that a young man well born well
educated son of an irreproachable
father whom i have known since he
was that high and so nice with a
mother like his could have sunk so

low as to commit such a deed as
burglary  it is a theft which doesnt
even call for courage in danger

   and theres a boy lost con-
demned that is the end of every-
thing for him acquitted-anything
is possible with a jury-means that
he will have benefited by a bit of a
doubt but which will always leave
something disgraceful sticking to
him he would have to leave riom
give up his profession how many
such catastrophes have i seen in my
professional life i this one how-
ever is too sad it has thrown me
into such a melancholy state that i
was trying to escape from it by
coming to mozat and then i ran
across you and you sec     i
was wrong to talk to you i have
increased my sadness    well
good-by my boy ill go on to tour-
noel mineralogy is my other
remedy i shall certainly find some
interesting scoriae at the bottom of
the volcano of banniere

vi

  ho he is the guilty one i  the
judge said to himself as he
started on the walk he had
just announced his intention of tak-
ing  no longer any doubt how
he trembled when he saw me i and
when i spoke of moreuil how his
face changed all the same it was
a proof that he has remained the
sensitive boy i have known his
fault is an accident pacotte was
right in his life there is a  dis-
turbant which is it gambling
love    whatever it may be
why did he not confess at once it
was so simple    no no mon-
sieur pingre it was not so simple
i have just verified this by moreuil
the impulsive confession does not
count it is the intended confession
which is of value why because it
is in harmony with the character
a false confession



  that is the confession which wipes
  out the fault it proves repentance
     will edmund repent   
  going the way i am  make his re-
  turn to riom and his father easier
  he saw me set off for tournoel and
  he will not be afraid of meeting
  me    his father it will be
  hard for him to speak to his father
  they have never understood each
  other very well while i    ah 
  if he were my son he would never
  have committed such an action as
  that  i know my son how many
  times has he squelched me with that
  phrase when i was not of his way
  of thinking in regard to edmund
  all the same his is such a splendid
  heart and he doesnt deserve this
  trouble    what time is it half
  past three  if edmund had his
  bicycle he could be at riom now
  but did he have it i should have
  noticed that but i was only thinking
  of studying him monsieur pingre
  a good judge should have an eye
  for everything

    he did not make haste to return
  obeying the curious law which com-
  pels us in certain anxieties to hold

i back the moment that we shall know
  the truth it was as if by his absence
  he were giing his godson a little
  time for the awakening of his con-
  science it was six oclock and night
  was falling when he turned the key
  in the lock of his apartment with
  a weary step he went into his study
  standing in front of the window
  edmund cantelme was waiting for
  him the judge gave a start at see-
  ing him and the emotion of this
  moment awakened in him again the
  deepest sources of tenderness

     it is i godfather edmund
  said simply in a choking voice

     well my child     replied
  pingre not finishing his sentence
  his voice too failed and he started
  to look for the matches saying in

order to get hold of himself  you
cant see here at all why didnt
you ask for a lamp 

   no godfather no light the
young man replied  no light   
listen to me first  i have some-
thing to say to you aid then after
a moment of silence something
very serious it was i who stole the
two thousand franc notes which my
father lost i have just put them
on his desk in full view in an en-
velope he must have found them
by now fie will take back his
charge    but i did not write
anything on the envelope and didn t
put anything in the envelope except
the notes he will take back his
charge but he may continue to sus-
pect gervais moreuil    you
too perhaps would have done the
same if i hadnt confessed papa
must know the truth he must for
the honor of this boy for his
future and with a firm tone  for
my honor also it is the only way
by which i can repair the wrong i
have done him but godfather
there is one thing i have not the
strength to endure an explanation
with my father you will tell him
how it is godfather i beg you i
beseech you

  he joined his hands in a despair-
ing gesture which the judge cut
short by drawing him to him

   oh godfather how kind you
are you understand me you will
tell my father that i am ready to do
anything to make up for it but that
if he doesnt want me to leave his
house he must not talk to me my
mother too-that will be hard but
she loves me so much    papa
loves me too i know it i know
it he continued  only    but
if he talks to me he will say words
which will make me leave home   
oh godfather promise that you will
persuade him not to talk to me if
world fiction

you love me promise promise   
 sit down said pingre who
was trembling also- in addition to
the drama of the young mans re-
morse he perceived another one ot
those latent tragedies which family
life too often develops the irredu-
cible and unhappy misunderstanding
of two beings of the same blood
who have never shown themselves
to each other as they really are he
was only too aware that the father
was jealous of his sons affection
for his godfather    but he must
know what  disturbant -to use
again pacottes words-had made
the other deviate  yes he in-
sited sit down then search-
ing among the papers for the one
on which the notary had written his
denunciation he tore it up in tiny
pieces saying to the young man who
looked at him in amazement

   that was the accusing docu-
ment the one i was to hand to the
prosecuting attorney moreuil has
nothing more to fear now if you
want me to do what you have asked
me to you must answer me have
you gambled in paris 

   never godfather

   then you took the money for a
woman  

   yes

   it was she then who led you to
do it saying  your father is a
notary notaries are rich

   no godfather no no inter-
rupted the student  she has noth-
ing to do with it all

   nothing she asked you for
money

   no godfather

   but you say that you stole for
her once more and dont lie
or    answer you live with her
in paris 

  no godfather    oh it is
a simple story enough but one that
has made me suffer so my friend

is in business i met her at the the-
atre  spoke to her she is a dress-
maker  saw her again i fell in
love with her and i think she loves
me but she is a coquette she has a
good deal of admiration she is
ambitious too there is some one
richer than i who is interested in
her up to now she has held off but
at the end of the month she has a
big bill falling due one of exactly
two thousand francs i was afraid
that when i went back she would
say to me  you and i love each
other my dear but one must live
you know after i left for my holi-
days i could think of nothing but
that a hundred times godfather

i have been on the point of telling
you my story and borrowing two
thousand francs from you and
then i drew back thinking  hell
tell jt all to my father and they
wont let me go back to paris iv
was in the garden the other after-
noon eating my heart out i hap-
pened to pass in front of the window
of papas study it was half open
the room was empty the keys in the
drawer    then  

  he stopped the shame of this
memory was too great

   then said the judge you ran
to get one of the wooden chairs
from the garden-house to raise you
up to the sill it was for that rea-
son that seeing me go and come be-
tween the garden-house and that
window you were afraid wasnt
it     and even at the moment
when pity shook his heart he felt
a slight professional satisfaction in
verifying the correctness of his
deductions

  he walked for a few moments up
and down the room then stopping
in front of the armchair in which
edmund was seated he said sol-
emnly

   i will do what you ask yes i
a false confession



will make your father agree never
to talk to you about your fault but
you will write a letter which i shall
dictate and swear to me on your
honor-on your new-found honor-
that you will act according to what
is written in that letter that will
be for me the proof-the only
proof-and i will not admit any
other you hear me that you will be
yourself again when i have dic-
tated this letter to you if you find
the undertaking too hard we will
tear it up but i wont have any-
thing more to do with it i shall do
my duty in telling your father and
you will settle with him

   dictate godfather the young
man said taking a sheet of paper
with a firm hand

   what is the name of this
woman asked the judge

   charlotte dardenne

   writ e mademoiselle dar-
denne

   but  edmund asked his pen
in the air

   mademoiselle dardenne the
godfather repeated in a tone so im-
perious that the godson obeyed this
time

      you will find enclosed the
  two thousand franc notes which
  you need to meet the bill of
  which you spoke to me i am
  sending them by registered
  mail with a blank reccipt do
  not trouble to reply to me my
  father has decided to keep me
  in his office to take the place
  of a clerk whom he is losing

  i shall not return to paris

     i beg to remain

         yours truly

   sign    now the address
here is an envelope

  once more the pen of the guilty
youth was suspended in air

  shall i tear up the letter
asked the judge extending his hand
to take the sheet

   no godfather said the young
man

   i will seal the letter and send
it pingre said  with the notes
you will repay me this money
later    lift up your head boy
you are an honest man for the rest
of your life go home now and
dine as if nothing had happened i
will see your father this evening
after dinner either he will come
here as is likely to announce to me
the restitution of the money or i
shall go to him i shall be able to
find the words which will induce him
not to talk to you

   and moreuil  said the young
man

   your father cant take him
back you must not come in contact
with him it would be too painful
for you but we will find a place for
him i will make it my business go
now good-by my child we must
not be sentimental it is not healthy
and it is health which you need -
he pointed to the letter- not to
weaken

   i shall not weaken said ed-
mund  i feel too great a relief in
being free and having confessed

the flies are a great nuisance
this autumn when the
sun warms the window of my
workroom they swarm on it buz-
zing and dancing a perfect or-
chestra a perfect ballet of them
i find scrubbs cloudy ammonia a
specific make little pools of it
all about and they will fall in
and-if one may judge of a flys
feelings-they do not suffer very
long a flop a few twists a wal-
low a little kicking and it is all
over they cannot of course read
the legend on the bottle standing
near  try it in your bath or the
irony might be accounted torture

  and at least one is more merciful
than nature man for all his wicked-
ness is apt to be the wasps have
fine sport amongst them i watched
one yellow gentleman for a whole
morning he bagged twenty at least
in he would fly with his deeper
angrier aeroplane buzz and set to
work without delay hed charge
at his little black prey on the
window frame miss once or twice
but at the third try for certain knock
the chap down falling with him and

on him so it seemed i saw no fly
escape after that the wasp clasps
it close rolls over and over with it
curving his queer jointed body for
a stronger grip once the fly gets
to know it is beaten the wasp takes
his time he rights himself and
adjusts his victim comfortably then
he proceeds with the utmost pre-
cision to mutilate he breaks off a
leg snips off a wing finally by a neat
stroke the little brown head falls
then he sails away with the corpse
out of the window he carries it
no doubt home to mrs wasp and
all the little wasps i am sure he is
an excellent husband and father

  the particular sportsman that i
watched for a morning was constant
to a few square inches of window
pane and of sill which was quite
covered in the end with the disjecta
membra of flies a queerly pathetic
sight for they dont look these
little scraps and ends like the limbs
of creatures so lately alive it is as
if rather a fly family had emptied
its hall cupboard of sticks hats and
mackintoshes as if there had been
looting in fly-town


flies-and a wasp



  i will confess that as i wanted to
be rid of the flies and the wasp was
doing me such good service i
watched him if with disgust yet
with approval but at the end of
the morning a foolish sentimentality
attacked me such an ugly so
callous a brute so busy i the clever
careful mangling of the delicate
little creatures was too revolting
and i felt a call to deal out poetic
justice i had gone to the window
to make a few more ammonia pools
there was my hunter dismembering
his twentieth fly i watched him for
half a minute then gave him a direct
dose from the bottle

  he didnt die easily the fly was
already dead i had done it no
good i hadnt intended to pity

and disgust both as i stood then
with poised bottle had given place
to the intoxication of power a
very slight surge of it truly devoting
one wasp to destruction but my
victim mine now put such force
into his struggles contorted himself
so demoniacally that for the second
or two he seemed morally to assume
gigantic proportions and i measured
myself up to godhead to match him
i was moloch or bel or one of the
other baalim and he in his gro-
tesque death agony looked like-it
suddenly came home-a savage
cartoon of a great prussian soldier
being gassed i know one thing if
theres any god feels as i did for
those few seconds he certainly ought
not to be worshipped

the function creates the organ

-oh doctor what feet how do you account for them

-he comes of a family of football players

        remo s a n n a looked
around eagerly as he stepped from
his car on entering the garden of
the villa bice

   where has my little savage hid-
den herself my little fiancee

   i dont know donna bice re-
plied  she was here two hours
ago a few minutes before your tele-
gram arrived probably shes in
the woods with the dogs well see
her falling in on us any moment all
torn and dusty and her mouth cov-
ered with mulberry stains

  always a little gypsy little
yanoule 

   always but  i dont
know even too much so at certain
moments do you know shes
already fourteen  

   i know has she grown 

   yes i think so in any case as
youll see this year has changed her
a lot shes a little taller but also
thinner or if not exactly thinner
shes slighter more    supple
yes theres already the little woman
budding

   dear little thing i still see
her with those thin straight active
legs 	

  oh not so thin any more   
do you think it was possible to make
her put on long stockings a
tragedy it seemed as though she
were going to be ill so i had to
give it up but i assure you its
indecent

   shes a child donna bice

   a child v   yes yes but
a strange child shes a child as
long as there is sunshine and she
can rove about in the sun and the
wind with towzled hair and her two
beasts possessed of the devil   
then it seems that she is intoxicated
with air and light but towards
evening shes not like that any more
when twilight falls she goes to a
corner of the garden or sits at the
window of her room and the child of
a moment before the disheveled
noisy girl is already far away
from that silent and absorbed little
creature who does not reply when
she is spoken to

   shes probably tired from play-
ing so much


yanoules broken heart



   no its something else its
the child who is already thinking of
new things there are little signs
that show    dosing of the eyelids
an unconscious gesture pulling down
her skirt over her naked knees or
trying to adjust her hair on the nape
of her neck sudden tender out-
bursts    unusual impatience
   certain ironical outbursts and
sudden silences    and then deep
melancholy concentrated in her ex-
pression  a strange disquiet-
ing type dear sanno

   perhaps you exaggerate all
children around fourteen are like
that the chrysalis is forming its
wings

   yes i know i know but she
differently more than the others
to me at least    and in
fact 

  donna bice interrupted herself
with a little tender sad smile
yes

  you know  i fear her
lather she resembles him so much
too much she adores him an
adoration born of unlimited ad-
miration he is her model for all
men do you know that when he is
away and he wtites to her she
doesnt even want me to read his
letters 

   really a strange child 

   however there is another
whom she admires almost as much
as her father    and that is you
you like giorgio are a man sur-
rounded by a halo of    yes in
short like giorgio 

   oh donna bice   

   yes indeed    one of those
delightful people quite unsuited to
be the husband of a little quiet
woman like me    and more-
over you have your great heroic
reputation    you are the man
of the tent under the stars who has
ascended equatorial rivers who has

lived among savages who has
brought her from the east this little
gypsy name of which she is so
proud    oh my poor little
yanoule i also can call her only
by that name now its very sweet
the name of your little gypsy but it
makes me tremble for her i fear
so much that she will be yanoule in
life instead of little jane

  they had reached the porch cov-
ered with crimson rambler roses

   reassure yourself donna
bice yanoule will be perfect what
you have given her will make her
proud of herself giorgio has added
what she needs to be gay

   may it be thus friend of
mine 

  she rang the bell

   dont you want to go upstairs
arent you tired 

   not at all donna bice ive
been barely half an hour in the car
on an excellent road not even a
speck of dust

   then would vou like some
tea

    yes indeed thank you

  the servant wras waiting for
orders

   bring the tea john    do
you know where yanoule is

   the signorina came in just a
minute ago from the orchard she
asked if there were any visitors and
when she heard that signor sanna
was here she ran off to her room
   she was all covered with mud
she looked as though she had fallen
into a bog she called serafina to
help her dress

   all right    tell her to
hurry

  then turning to remo sanna

   she is dressing up for you the
little coquette   

  for me im sorry sanno
said laughing  i would have
liked to see her looking like a
world fiction

is this the way you greet your

fiance  sanna called out laugh-
ing  well then no ring 

there was no reply for a mo-
ment then in a rapid burst of
laughter she called out  really

fina how stupid not like that 
sounds of much confusion and
the noise of broken glass

her head and repeated to

ready set now

woman of twi-
light

 remo sanna
went out into the
garden and called
up to the windows
of the first floor
yanoule

yanoule 

  one of the shutters
opened and an astonished
little pale face with two
big deep black eyes ap-
peared in the opening

 good day  or
rather good evening

away 

  and she disappeared

   yanoule little gypsy
yanouls broken heart



the window said  shame gypsies

  yanoule replied from the room

remo sanna

ing down  called out the little gay
voice

  remo sanna and donna bice re-
entered the veranda

   what did you bring her sanna

    oh a trifle a little syrian ring

   you are very kind

   i promised it to her last year

  sanna sanna you are never
old you men are all alike

   as fiance of a child however
you will admit    winter and
spring  

  a barking of dogs interrupted
them yanoule approached running
with blitz and rodomonte on a
leash they were jumping all over
her biting her legs the long
straight legs with small shapely
ankles incased in the black stock-
ings in the hated long stockings
under the short skirt of a little girl
she came panting not pale any

   more but with her smiling face suf-
fused with pink and with a dash of
powder left under one eye the
dogs growled at the stranger
yanoule gave blitz the greyhound
a kick crying out

   quiet beasts hes a friend
she greeted remo sanno with a
strong handshake saying

   welcome home  

  remo sanna gazed silently for
a moment at the graceful slim and
straight little person who stood in
front of him and who was looking
up at him with her deep bright eyes
full of joy and curiosity under her
puckered brow yes there was
something changed the face which
had become pale again seemed to be
thinner and foreshadowed the
woman of tomorrow but today she
was still the child the little wild
yanoule the gypsy who had combed
her hair in a hurry the little make-
believe fiancee who could still be
kissed on her tawny hair by this man
of thirty-nine he bent over her to
kiss her on the forehead pressing
the little hands in his and murmur-
ing  dear dear little yanoule

  remo sanna had now been a
guest at the villa bice for a week
giorgio lanzi had returned and had
forced his friend to remain the
autumn days passed quickly and hap-
pily in motoring and long friendly
chats in the garden yanoule would
burst in upon them with her dogs
like a meteor panting and red in
the face when she was tired of rov-
ing through the grove of chestnut
trees hunting chipmunks

   good evening father good
evening mother good evening
signor you i 

  she never called him either signor
remo or signor sanna but just
 signor you    

  she would go into the house and


world fiction

re-appear all tidy with her hair
done up long stockings shoes
shined a few dashes of powder care-
lessly left under her eyes and in her
ears

  one evening when she stayed in
her room longer than usual remo
noticed that she had attempted to
manicure her nails and when she got
up later tottering with sleep to go
to bed he bent over her and kissed
the nails which were too red
yanoule made a face at him and ran
away

  one evening after returning to
the villa bice with the lanzi and the
child from a long drive which had
been prolonged tor three hours by a
blowout in the mountains remo
sanna said goodnight to his hosts
and retired to his room he lit the
light and stood before the mirror
where he remained looking at him-
self carefully after a minutes ex-
amination he murmured

    winter and spring

  turning around he added  no
nothing could be more stupid

  he walked up and down the room
with furrowed brow

   worse than stupid wtretched
the severity of the word shocked
him-into a laugh

   no only stupid neverthe-
less i must leave

  he reflected some more and re-
peated  go away and at once
he searched in his pocket and
brought out a carnation all crushed
pjid faded

   my poor dear little one 

  he attempted to smile again but
could not he sat down in front of
the desk rested his head on his arms
and chewed the stalk of the faded
carnation trying to understand
something about himself and what
had happened to him

  it was on the way back from the
mountains the chauffeur had re-

  paired the damage the motor had
started up again giorgio in front
was driving he sat behind with
donna bice and yanoule in be-
tween it was dark and cold they
had had to take out the rugs and
cover themselves then yanoule
said she was sleepy

   lean against my shoulder little
one and sleep

  she had rested her head on him
and closed her eyes but she did
not sleep after a while he leaned
over to look at her her eyes were
wide open and bright too bright
she was crying in silence he had
felt the little heaving of veiled sobs
against his arm the car was run-
ning along noisily on the hard road

   what is the matter yanoule 
he murmured to her quietly sur-
prised and moved she had not
answered she had nestled closer
to him had felt for his hand had
squeezed it tight tight    why
why

  what is the matter he had
asked again and she had squeezed
his hand even more as though beg-
ging him not to make himself heard
he did not know what to think a
sudden bewilderment a sweet emo-
tion sorrowful indefinable had
come over him he had endeavored
to withdraw his hand it was re-
strained as in a little vice and he
felt so moved so stunned so be-
wildered that suddenly he noticed
that he also was weeping so for
two hours during all the drive back
his hand of forty years had re-
mained prisoner of that little hand
of spring wrhen they had almost
reached the house he had felt that
hand withdraw itself then again
seek his and place in it something-
that carnation  

   did you sleep well yanoule 
her father asked her on descending
from the car
yanoules broken heart



   yes very she had answered
in a sleepy voice she started
towards her room swaying her head
as though she were still tottering
with sleep

   its incredible its incredible
remo sanna now murmured walk-
ing up and down the room nervous
and restless-  if i didnt have this
carnation here i would think id
been dreaming    its absurd
inconceivable  

  he passed in front of the mirror
stopped again looked for an instant
at his face marked by the wind of
the sea and the desert for an instant
he imagined the pale face of yanoule
beside his and he burst out laugh-
ing

   no it is too grotesque  and
he repeated  i must leave

  at that moment he heard a slight
rustling behind the windows his
room was on the ground floor and
looked out on the garden he ran
to the window and tore it open he
saw a white form disappearing be-
hind the veranda among the clusters
of rambler roses

   yanoule  he called under his
breath his heart beating wildly

  no one replied but the ramblers
opened up and the white form which
was barely to be seen in the dark
dropped to the ground he thought
she had fallen leaped over the
window-sill and ran to her no she
was only crouching there to hide
herself

   yanoule he murmured
what are you doing here why
arent you in bed   come get

up 

  yanoule did not reply she re-
mained on the ground looking up at
him chewing a hanging twig her
black eyes mirroring the stars and
seeming darker and more lovely in
the luminous pallor of the little face

   get up  he repeated- he

offered her his hand yanoule
rose

   why did you go out 

  she shook her shoulders and
blew away a leaf which had re-
mained between her lips u i al-
ways go out  i come to see the
dogs    she replied looking
absently at her left hand and play-
ing with the gold circlet on her
linger

  remo sanna was silent for a
moment mechanically he placed a
hand on her hair caressing it and
murmured  come come child   

y ou must cure yourself

   of what  she questioned
stupefied raising her forehead
under the caress looking at him
with eyes in which tears and smiles
were trembling  why cure my-
self is it an illness

  remo sanna did not know how
to reply a great melancholy sud-
denly descended on his heart an
immense pity for himself and for
that queer little creature all aglow
with her innocent ardor

   i was waiting for you   
yrou returned    thats all
yanoule said quietly looking else-
where adjusting her hair on the
nape of her neck

   you were waiting for me
why 

   you know the child replied
gravely

  remo felt two tears on his cheeks
he took both of yanoules hands in
his and without well knowing what
he was saying asked her

   why  do you think so
much of me  

   so much the little voice re-
plied without trembling

  oh poor poor little yanoule
but its absurd burst out remo
sanna attempting to smile

 why  the child said reflecting
 dont i like father very much


world fiction

and you are like father only you
are not father 

  they remained looking at each
other in silence then yanoule
withdrew a step stretched out her
hand to remo sanna and murmured
laughing

    good night child  why do you
cry it s foolish 

   once more becoming a little elf
she made a face at him an infinite
tenderness sorrowful grieved
overcame remo sanna he held the
little hand for a moment then took
yanoules head in his two hands
and bent over to kiss her hair as was
his custom but yanoule lifted up
her face and he felt her damp fra-
grant mouth pass lightly over his
arid lips   

  one second he opened his
eyes again stunned yanoule was
already far away he was alone
in the dark garden under the in-
numerable stars of that quiet autumn
evening holding in his heart the
thrill of that absurd and divine hour

  he left the next day he gave
as an excuse his last journey about
which the geographical society was
urging him to write and as
giorgio and donna bice seemed sad
at his sudden departure he promised
to return just so as to be able to
hurry away yanoule told him
good-bye gaily pulling his mus-
taches and ran away with the
dogs

   two days later a letter of thanks
arrived from him then nothing
more for two weeks one evening
the lanzi were seated at dinner and
another letter arrived giorgio
opened it and glanced through it
 oh  oh i what news i  he suddenly
exclaimed  remo sanna is going to
be married

   really  said donna bice
 who is he marrying 

   he doesnt say    here
you read it

   he held out the letter to his wife
and continued to peel a pear

  what a surprise i  donna bice
said having read the letter  but
its natural he must be tired of
that wandering life

  the discussion ceased no one
had noticed yanoule who had left
the table and thrown herself into an
armchair

   whats the matter yanoule
are you tired you are a little pale
this evening

   im sleepy the child an-
swered quietly  im cold too

    really its beginning to be cold
and it looks as though a big storm
were coming said donna bice
 go off to bed dear

   yes mamma

  she arose and in a sleepy voice
said good-night and went up to her
room two hours later all in the
villa bice slept except yanoule the
little deserted fiancee her eyes
were staring in the dark of her room
which every moment the lightning
lit up with vivid flashes she was
not crying she was lying there her
head buried in the pillows immov-
able breathing heavily and with
great open fixed eyes darker than
the shadows of night her long eye-
lashes hardly moving at the flashes
of lightning a burst of rain
whipped the shutters violently
the foliage of the trees fluttered
wildly in front of the pane a win-
dow burst open more vivid
blinding flashes broke the darkness
followed by a crash the storm
beat down on the lonely villa on
the trees in the garden with a great
noise of roaring of hissing and
howling

  yanoule sat up in bed slipped
from under the covers remained
immobile for a moment straight and
yanoules broken heart



supple in her nightgown then began
cautiously and lightly to move about
the room which was lit up every sec-
ond by the rapid lightning she took
a shawl from the doakstand wrap-
ped herself in it looked at the litrie
ring on her finger kissed it opened
the door and disappeared

  the storm was raging more and
more violently yanoule was al-
ready outside of the villa-outside
of the garden she had climbed
over the fence
with her bare feet
wading in the rivu-
lets lashed by the
cold squalls shiv-
ering in her very
bones the little
white shadow ran
and ran up the
path on the moun-
tain towards the
little shrine of the
madonna which
had been struck
by lightning the
year before the
madonna had
been saved be-
cause she was
the madonna but
yanoule thought
that she would
not be saved
that she was only a little broken-
hearted creature and she wanted
she wanted to die and for this rea-
son she ran up there to call the
lightning to call it down on her
head

  she ran and ran and her feet
were bleeding and torn by the thorns
scratched and cut by the stones the
chestnut trees rustled and crackled
lashed by the squalls all the moun-
tain howled two bolts rent the
black sky zigzagging between the
galloping clouds on she ran with
the little wet shawl and nightgown

clinging to her panting and trem-
bling her darkened eyes fixed on the
empty space where the litde shrine
of the madonna had stood

  she steadied herself against the
wind which once she had left the
shelter of the woods whipped her
with such fury that it seemed as
though it wanted to carry her away
she fell on her knees in front of the
image cried out desperately  lit-
tle madonna little madonna
mine   then
w i t ji convulsive
agility she clam-
bered up on the
platform and
crouched down
holding on tight
with one hand
to a rusty cross
so as not to be
carried away by
the wind she
raised the other
hand the one with
the ring straight
towards the sky
and closed her
eyes between the
convulsive chatter-
ing of her teeth
and the sobs which
shook her she mur-
mured 

   oh have pity on me little ma-
donna i let    me    die

  but the little madonna was
merciful another flash fell with
a great rumbling but further off on
the high mountain yanoule re-
opened her eves the rain had sud-
denly ceased the wind was blow-
ing with less violence and up in the
sky between the clouds which were
rushing away the stars were once
more shining just a few more
minutes and the storm was only a
distant noise yanoule looked
around amazed still trembling and


world fiction

sobbing a great quiet spread over
the chestnut grove the crowing
of a cock rose up from below and
then the barking of a dog yanoule
recognized it her blitz her house
was down there with her dear
mother and her adored father and
her dogs and the rambler roses  
what had she done  why was she
there she saw again a bronzed
and proud face heard a voice which
repeated  poor poor little ya-
noule  but distant and veiled
that face and that voice she de-
scended from the little platform
and knelt again in front of the image
and murmured

   pardon pardon little ma-
donna and taking the golden ring
off her finger she placed it in the
niche and fled down the hill

  a little later she was again in her
room she wasnt cold any more
she was burning she made a
bundle out of the soaking night-
gown and the shawl and hid
them getting into bed she fell
asleep

  next morning she had a little
fever and cough but nothing
much-acold

   the first cold the doctor said
she stayed in bed a couple of days
then she got up and began to roam
around again with blitz and rodo-

monte perfectly cured of every-
thing

  cured cured for ever so much
so that when five years later at a
lall they told her that remo sanna
had died on an expedition in the
midst of the gran chaco she only
said

  poor thing i knew him very
well    he was such a friend
of fathers and he was married
wasnt he 

  the quadrille was beginning and
she rose to take the arm of her
young cavalier who called her as
everyone did  signorina yanoule
and she didnt even remember who
had given her that perfumed and
languid nickname

  no remo sanna had not mar-
ried nor had he ever thought of
it he had again thrown himself
into his violent and adventurous life 
without rest in order to forget the
kiss of a child-the man who had
kissed the lips of so many forgot-
ten women and she never knew
the signorina yanoule that when
his bones were traced long after-
wards there was discovered amongst
the rags which covered him in an
old portfolio among some insignifi-
cant papers a dry flowfcr-a car-
nation
a fishing settlement

                 by

         henrik pontoppidan

          from the danish by harold toksvig

hendrik pontoppidan was born in  in the little jutland
city of fredericia where his father was minister he studied
engineering taught school for a year and made his debut
in literature with the novel clipped wings in  he
was gifted with wholesomencss of spirit and a keen satirical
perception and he attacked in his work the whole web of
romantic fantasies and false emotions that were then dominant
in danish life and literature in all he has produced forty
volumes among them the three volume novel lucky peter
which won him the nobel prize in  one of his children
is an american citizen residing in asheville north carolina

way out by the open sea lay a
small poor fishing settle-
ment-eight ten tiny black
wooden huts half buried in the
sand and with their gables up
against each other the low row of
houses crept together like a cater-
pillar back of the high naked dune
over which the angry surf cast its
froth

  on quiet summer days when the
sun melted the tar out of the tim-
bered walls and scorched the sand so
it burned under the feet the little
colony could however unfold itself
and like a butterfly bursting through
its cocoon throw a momentary col-
orful southern atmosphere over the
sad waste up on the dunes stood
rows of stakes with flapping fish
nets crowds of half-naked children
noised on the outer beach and here
and there were sun-browned women
in red skirts squatting around a fire
in the sand cooking pitch

  but under the first equinoctial
storm when the sky lay low over the
deserted sand hills when the big
white gulls pressed close to the
rolling waters edge and the sand
whirled like drifting snow-then

the little colony crept back of its
dune again blinds and shutters were
closed and doors barred then even
the smoke did not want to leave the
vents in the black burnt roof boards
but hung low and as if in fright over
the roofs and day after day the
little fishing colony lay as if in a long
sleep while sand and large flakes of
scum whirled over it

  during dark nights it might hap-
pen that through the noise of the sea
that thundered against the dunes a
sound would be heard as of a door
that is forced open with difficulty
and at once slammed shut by the
storm  a man crawls up the
slanting sand dune lies down on his
stomach and begins to listen with
his hand behind his ear after a
while another man comes up and
stretches out beside him a sleepy
conversation-interrupted by hour-
long pauses-takes place between
them

  but suddenly they both get up and
run quickly down to the houses
knock on a door here a shutter
there and shout everywhere the
same short word

  broad men with whiskered faces




world fiction

appear gradually through the dark-
ness in thick stiff coats they move
about among each other without
talking busy themselves with ropes
ladders and boat hooks until they at
length gather about a little lanthorn
and in a close crowd move eastward
back of the dunes

  here and there back of a half
open door can be seen the upper part
of a half naked female with her hair
uncombed over her shoulders but
when the men have disappeared the
doors are closed    and again
cnly the seas hollow constant
thundering is heard

  but in the east on the dunes a
flame blazes up after a while against
the dark sky  a pitch torch
from which dark red sparks fly in-
land

  an hour or two passes

  then suddenly a many voiced
shriek comes out of the sea at the
same moment the torch is extin-
guished everything is darkness

   but out over the breakers it is as
though the storm had gathered in its
wildest strength it sounds like the
beating of the wings of some giant
bird in distress ropes burst there
is tramping on a deck and the sound
of a loud commanding voice is lost
in a confused shouting of many
mouths and a womans high cutting
screams of fright

   in under the dunes facing the sea
sit the little broad men in a circle
around the lanthorn which throws a
red gleam over the sand and up in
the whiskered faces quietly wait-
ing they sit with their hands around
their knees or with their heads rest-
ing in their hands as if they slept

  none of them speak now and
then when the womans wails and
the monotonous howling of the
sailors becomes too heart rending
they look at each other a little em-
barrassed and try to smile and one

 old fellow who sits outermost in the
 row turns stealthily away and
 mumbles something over a rosary
 that he has furtively taken out of
  his coat

   then suddenly it seems that the
 ocean tremblingly lifts itself in
 power a series of hollow crashes
 sound in over the shore like shots
 from distant cannon then all is
 quiet not a scream

   after a while the seething water
 between the dunes and the surf is
 full of splintered ships goods which
 mill around as in a boiling kettle
 some is thrown all the way up on
 the outer beach some is washed
 back with the waves or crushed on
 the spot a large mast stump with
 a mass of tangled rope is flung on
 land and a short cry escapes the
 shipwrecked one who has clung to it

   he is saved

   but at once a knife is in his side
 and he rolls over backwards the
 men surround him and the lanthorn
 is held up to his face as that sinks
 backwards to the sand with a last
 faint surprised look

    its wine  mumbles the man
 with the lanthorn after he has
 scanned the dying mans dark hair
 and olive colored skin

   the others nod in agreement

  a bowlegged mannikin bends
down and feels about the strangers
clothes and sees a pair of rings that
gleam in his ears whereupon he
for safetys sake gives him still an-
other deep steaming wound in the
side before he leaves him and
waddles toward the waters edge

   here the others are already en-
 gaged with the help of boat hooks
 and rope nooses in saving what they
 can from the surf while the
 morning slowly announces itself out
 there in the grey cold fog over the
 sea the wine barrels and the splin-
 tered planks are hauled ashore as
a fishing settlement

i

the waves wash them up the
corpses are pulled in and plundered
chests and boxes with gay silks are
broken open and examined

  in the meantime the women come
out from the settlement with warm
beer in great wooden tankards
which go around among the men
shivering in the morning cold they
stand in a group on the edge of the
dunes and stare with a covetous
gleam in their eyes on the heaped up
glories beneath them

  towards noon when there is noth-
ing more to salvage and the naked
corpses have conscientiously been
buried under the dunes the barrels
are with much gayety rolled into the
huts the great wooden tankards are
set on the tables the men and the
silk-bedecked women seat them-
selves around them-and day after
day the little settlement riots in
heedless intoxication with song and
noise in the long nights while sand
and white hakes of scum whirl over
it

  

   but all this is far far back in the
past the little fishing villages
saga is now half forgotten up there
in the silent waste where ocean and
sand year after year have erased
graded and buried everything

  on beautiful summer evenings
when the sun sets in crimson clouds
and reddens the ocean it occasion-
ally happens that the conscientious
lather of a family on a pleasure trip
in the naturally beautiful regon
will caught by the view stop by a
halt washed up wreck on the shore
and for his listening children unroll
pictures of the bloody scenes and
nightly horrors of that time

  but he never neglects to mention
how far man has progressed since
then how civilization in this respect
also has done its great humane
work and as he dutifully explains

this to them he points with pride to
the solidly founded life-saving sta-
tion that peeps out from behind the
sand hills or out toward the east to
the small hat point which pushes out
into the sea where the tall light-
house towers toward heaven like
lands last great milepost

  the dunes about them- have also
been brought under civilization and
have thoughtfully been planted with
long straight rows of sea reeds and
lyme grass that shall protect against
sand drift in between them are now
light-brown heath-flats and peaceful
swamps that lie and steam in the
silent summer nights

  the settlement itself has through
the hundreds of years kept its
strange worm shape but it is now a
large fishing village with a church
and a minister with a store and an
inn and a lot of small houses whose
tiled roofs shine doubly red between
the white-green sand hills

  on quiet summer days when the
sun melts the tar out of the few old
wooden huts that are still left and
glows the sand so it burns under the
feet the city unfolds itself in its
loneliness again as in the old days-
spreads itself out over the dunes
with black stakes for the nets and
dried fish with noisy crowds of bare-
legged children on the outer beach
and groups of strong sunburned
women in red skirts that squat on
the sand by a steaming kettle and
peel potatoes

  along the shore the artists sit
neck and neck under large yellow
umbrellas like toads under toad-
stools poets swarm about with long
hair and notebooks and all over the
village are flocks of strangers that
eagerly view the curious settlement
and its interesting dwellers

     toward noon the heat be-
came really oppressive not a


world fiction

breeze stirred over the sea and
the village a haze of heavy warmth
settled that beat everything to the
ground

  around the houses lay ducks pigs
and children asleep with their faces
against the glowing hot sand
heavy and sleepy with bare legs
and unbuttoned waists women went
in and out of the doors and
threw peevish glances toward a
small door in a
little bit of a
house where a
young tourist
with a mosquito
netting around
his hat stood
fooling with a
pair of giggling
fishing girls

  the laughter
of these glad
girls was soon
the only sound
heard in the
village

  even the bare-
legged little girls
who all morning
had run with
lifted skirts and
splashed along
the edge of the
beach had grown tired and had sat
down in the shade of some beached
boats where they rested with their
hands in their laps and looked at the
small piping beach swallows that
darted over the surface of the water
and dove after fish

  an elderly gentleman with a tall
grey hat pushed back on his head
and a pair of enormous travelers
binoculars hanging on his stomach
stepped out on the stairs of the inn
and delightedly sniffed the  most
interesting  sea air that to tell the
truth had received a somewhat sul-
try admixture of manure smells and

the stench of half rotten fish

  up on the edge of the dunes the
fishermen sat with their small pipes
in their mouths and mended nets
some had already let their chins sink
on their chests and slept most of
them sat and half nodded and cast
now and then a dull look out over
the sea    this great empty
milk-blue sea that lay there so
shining and quiet so hopelessly de-
serted that one
could have
thought it dead
had not its heavy
measured pulse-
beats been heard
by the shore

  out there in
the northwest
was a big steamer
with a thick
woolly smoke in
a mile-long trail
after it

 it was the
two brothers
an english
freighter that
was going east of
the point in order
to get southward
into the katte-
gat on its way to
one of the baltic ports

  on board everything was quiet
they had only just taken a bearing
and felt safe about the coast

  around in the forecastle where
there was the most shade lay the
sailors-an irish german and
swedish medley-in red and check-
ered woolen shirts sleeping with
their noses on the deck it was the
captains own watch he sat in his
pleasant little enclosure on the
bridge from which he could in all
comfort observe the ships progress
and view the sunny coast they were
sailing past
a fishing settlement



  he was a little short-necked eng-
lishman stuffed with beef and por-
ter and as red and shining as a cop-
per kettle the milk-white eyes
that were absolutely fixed were of
a deathlike dullness there was
not a movement in his face as
he sat there and smoked sweet-
smelling shag after breakfast

  but he was not alone beside
him half on his lap sat a young
slender girl her white fingers play-
ing in his rough beard neither of
them spoke occasionally when she
coughed from the cloud of smoke
that he unconcernedly puffed over
her she shook him playfully by his
hairy ear but at the least im-
patient growling from the fat belly
she let go of the ear in pretended
fright and snuggled to him like a cat
with an ingratiating purring

  ihat was little mary as she
called herself in confidence here
captain charles-when he conde-
scended to talk at all-called her
simply mary

  among the crew-where on the
whole she seldom showed herself-
or by the cook or the steward she
was addressed only with a polite
 miss and when in the after-
noon she took her daily walk up and
down the afterdeck-quiet straight
and correctly english-with her
hands in the pockets of her tightly
buttoned jacket both mate and sail-
ors stepped aside without so much as
indicating by an expression that they
quite well knew what her position
was

  they had taken her aboard more
than two months before in liver-
pool and captain charles had on
several occasions banged the table
and sworn that now he would land
her in the first english port they
touched and send her back to the
miserable hole where she belonged
but the mellow sunshine of the last

few weeks and the easy voyages had
made him soft as a mitten always
there was something beseeching in
her eyes that he could not withstand
and her little hand had lain so softly
about his neck that he had regularly
withdrawn his words and had occa-
sionally experienced a feeling almost
as if his heart had moved beneath
the fat under his vest mary was
only seventeen years old

  he was sitting now satisfied and
motionless after breakfast and had
fallen away into the strangest
dreams he was thinking whether
he should keep her the rest of the
summer    perhaps all winter
   perhaps really marry the girl
eventually he had got so used to
having her around that he could
hardly think of being without her
of course his friends would make
fun of him if he went and married
her and home in grangemouth it
would make a terrible commotion
but he could of course let them
laugh as long as he wras at sea he
would not notice it anyway and
besides as far as marys past was
concerned she was really excused be-
cause of the home she had come
from her father was an idler who
on more than one occasion had
beaten her half to death in drunken
frenzy and her mother was an old
hussy who had herself taught her the
profession besides mary was
really not more than a child who
hardly knew what sort of a life she
had entered

  as he sat thinking these thoughts
and as mary amused herself by rest-
ing her head on his chest and letting
it rock up and down with his breath-
ing there came a couple of light
jolts in the ship which in a few
moments stopped while the strokes
of the piston down in the engine
room suddenly took on a furious
speed


world fiction

  captain charles heavy body had
in an instant pushed mary aside
with a thundering oath he rushed out
of the door signalled  stop  to the
engine room and leaned out over the
bridge yes-exactly the ship
stood still under the clear glass
green water small stones and mussel
shells blinked up from the serried
sand bank that it had softly settled
into

  his face that for a moment had
lost all color became crimson but
when he had looked over the ships
side and reassured himself that
there was no damage done he quiet-
ly shouted an  all right  out over
the deck where the crew had come
to life from all directions and hung
over the rail

   half speed-reverse-h a  f
speed  he then commanded to the
engine room and now when the
machinery began to work he went
back and forth a few times on the
bridge and took a couple of great
draughts on his shag pipe in order
to get completely over the fright

  but the ship did not move not
even when he had commanded
 full speed-reverse did it move
from the spot no matter how
much the engine puffed and hissed
and how angrily the smoke roared
out of the smoke stack-the heavy
ship lay just as motionless only
groaning a little under the efforts
with a jingling sound of iron

  in the meantime the accident had
been noticed on the shore by some
fishermen that stood with great sea
boots in the waters edge and pulled
in nets-for an artist a message
was hastily sent into the slumbering
village to wake the people from
their midday nap

  and now there was life first
one by one then in flocks the men
came trotting though the dunes
laughter chuckling in their stomachs

 and all the highest dune tops near
 the village were gradually peopled
 by women and children who stood
 with hands shading their eyes and
 stared toward the north from all
 directions people came traveling
 over the heath shouting and pointing
 to each other from a distance the
 wrecking commissioner and the
 police inspector came riding in a
 wagonette and all the tourists-
 both ladies and gentlemen-had
 head over heels left the inns break-
 fast table in order to rush to the
  scene of the wreck   the man with
 the grey top hat before all the
 others storking along with his long
 legs and with his napkin stuck in a
 back pocket in the confusion

   in the village everything was dis-
 turbed feverish activity people
 flocked together outside the street
 doors and asked and volunteered
 explanations only when it was
 absolutely established that the ship
 was grounded-solidly undeniably
 fast-was the oppression lifted and
 an unpent joy broke out that even
 infected the children so they began
 to run through the streets shouting
 hurrah the grocer hopped
 smilingly up on his office chair and
 gave orders to hoist the large
 whiskey barrel up fromthe cellar
 people stopped in at neighbors and
 acquaintances and everywhere was
 the odor of coffee even the old
 people and the cripples that could
 hardly walk staggered up to the
 nearest sand hill in order to enjoy
 the sight of the big steaming sea
 monster that lay out there and
 groaned trying to get loose

   the beach facing the stranded
 vessel was black with people and
 out around the steamer which was
 stuck in the third bar several hun-
 dred yards from the shore lay a
 crowd of boats with fishermen of the
 so-called salvage crew that hailed
a fishing settlement



 the captain every time he showed
 himself on the bridge

  captain charles however acted
as if he neither saw nor heard them
he had through the mate given an
order that no stranger be allowed on
board and obstinately rejected
every offer of help he had
launched his own longboat and let
some of the men row aft with two
anchors with strong chains which
were attached to the capstan bar
the engineer had received orders to
get steam up  all the way to the red
line -for loose they had to get

  under all this he walked up and
down the bridge with his hands in
the pockets of his coat or sat in the
enclosure and drank undiluted
whiskey from a beer glass marys
frightened round cat eyes followed
his every move and the expressions
of his red face she had a couple
of times tried to approach him but
he had violently pushed her away

  the two anchors had after a
while been placed the engine began
again to work the steam hissed the
chains tightened    but the
ship did not move an inch   
sank only just a little deeper in the
sand with every fruitless attempt

  in the meantime more people had
come to the beach and more boats in
the water all the way from out by
the point and from a neighboring
settlement to the south fishermen
came pulling their yawls along the
coast there was at last a whole
fleet of small vessels that crowded
about the stranded ship and pushed
and pulled themselves forward
among each other amid the loud
gaycty of their crews especially
were they interested in guessing at
the cargo which they hoped was
such that it would screw the salvage
charge way up cotton for example
or iron it could hardly be coal
they agreed since preparations had

not at once been made to unload

  somewhat apart from the others
lay a six-oared boat with the wreck-
ing commissioner he was a portly
heavy-limbed man who tried to re-
gard the whole scene with superior
unconcern in reality there was no
one more interested in the value of
the ship and its cargo than he as he
had a lawful claim to a half per cent
of the salvage wage just through his
mere presence

  the customs assistant a fat man
with gold rimmed glasses ap-
proached in another boat and
greeted him

   what do you think hr con-
sul he said and laughed into a
fiery red beard that fairly blazed in
the sunlight  to run in here in
the middle of the day  in this
kind of weather by god we can
call that a present 

  the wrecking commissioner made
a movement with his shoulders that
could be interpreted as one liked

   its iron they say continued
the customs assistant

   oh god knows answered the
other with almost priestly solemnity
and looked straight in front of him
 it looks like a coal dragger its
english

  the customs assistant laughed
again

  english yes and tough and
obstinate as an english beefsteak
   can you imagine hr con-
sul how he still thinks he can get out
of it

   oh well perhaps he really
will be able to answered the com-
missioner with a disappointed ex-
pression of christian compassion
only in the corners of his mouth
could a muscle play be traced that
betrayed his excitement

   i beg your pardon gentlemen
but is what has been told me else-
where true that the wrecking


world fiction

steamer has been telegraphed for i 

   it was the man with the grey top
hat he had hired a boat with four
interesting old fishermen and sat-
trembling with excitement-in the
stern the uncased binoculars in his
hand

    could such really be the case 
he continued as he was not at once
answered  i have heard on trust-
worthy reports that it was ex-
pected

    yes we will probably have it
here in a moment answered the
consul and looked toward the east

   there turning around the point
from the south-shortly afterwards
a little steamer came in sight the
consul at once gave his crew a signal
the oars went into the water and in
a few minutes the boat was along-
side the stranded ship

  to the mate who at once ap-
peared he told who he was and
asked if help was desired captain
charles who from his cabin on the
bridge had seen the little steamer
stop and anchor a few cable lengths
away sent the answer no

    no  he repeated with tightly
clenched teeth and hit the table with
his fist when the mate hesitated
about taking the answer he sat
with a whiskey jug in front of him
and had emptied the third glass

  the consul shoved off and rowed
full speed to the shore

   a couple of hours passed

   on the beach the crowd of people
steadily became larger because now
the women also came and brought
food and drink to the men they
camped about in the sand the
whiskey bottles went around they
clinked glasses and enjoyed them-
selves as at a picnic

   towards sunset the surface of the
sea suddenly rippled and the boats
that still lay around the ship began
to bob up and down there were

no clouds in the sky but the sun had
become strangely faint and way out
on the horizon the sea was growing
rougher

  before a quarter of an hour had
passed the sea ran so high that the
boats had to come ashore by
shoulders put to the gunwales they
were pushed up on the beach and
the women gradually sought shelter
under the broad bows-

  the sky was now completely
clouded over and the wind had in-
creased in strength so it looked
quite serious for the ship it lay in
the middle of the outermost break-
ers broadside to the sea that already
broke heavily over it from the
shore one could plainly see how one
cloud of spray after another dashed
over the rail

  people who were equipped with
binoculars suddenly observed great
activity on board the crew ran
back and forth on the deck a boat
was launched and an anchor chain
was heard rushing out it was
plain that a last decisive attempt
was to be made great masses of
smoke with heaps of big sparks
rolled out under the dark sky and
the screw began to work aft

  from the shore it looked quite un-
canny some of the women began
to be uneasy otherwise it was
absolutely quiet on the shore now
in the northwest the sun went down
blood red behind great rising cloud
masses

  then the engine stopped out
there and after still another long
pause during which everybody on
the beach had gotten up they saw
through the oncoming darkness the
signal of distress that was slowly
raised

   now hes crying they said and
laughed

   the districts eight-oared life-sav-
ing boat which now had been
a fishing settlement



secured was launched with the
wrecking commissioner and the
police inspector who should respec-
tively arrange and certify with die
seals of the law the terms of
salvage still a third man had a
place in the boat a little thin man in
a grey ulster and with a black glove
on the left hand in which he held his
hat this was the salvaging com-
panys agent who had been landed
from the little steamer upon its
arrival and had since then remained
on the beach

  the wind had already grown to
storm proportions but with care-
fully timed strokes the wrell trained
crew guided the boat through the
waves and in twenty minutes the
three men were on board the
mate received them and conducted
them below deck to the officers
mess there sat captain charles
-very drunk-back of a table over
which a lighted swinging lamp
hung from the big tin shades
white-painted interior the light was
thrown over the polished mahogany
surface the rest of the room lay in
a greenish darkness

  he received the strangers without
a greeting and asked shortly and
pointedly  what it would cost

  the agent asked to be allowed to
see the ships papers when these
were brought to him and he had in-
formed himself of the value of the
cargo the age of the ship amount
of insurance etc he answered

   six thousand pounds

  captain charles gave a jerk it
was as if he had suddenly become
sober t hen a peculiar smile of res-
ignation glided over his blue-white
lips

   oh so thats it- was all he
said half to himself

  there was a couple of moments
silence behind the captain the sea
beat unceasingly against the ships

side and the blows sounded so weird
and hollow in this close room that
the young police inspector who was
still new to his job became paler and
paler and looked longingly toward
the door up on deck sounded the
heavy tramp of sea boots

   four thousand pounds cap-
tain charles said finally

  the agent shrugged his shoulders
regretfully

    impossible i 

  the wrecking commissioner
whose duty it was to stand by the
captain and protect the shipping
companys and the insurance com-
panys interests now stepped in to
act the part of mediator but as he
knew that the salvage company on
principle never reduced an otter
and that it was to his advantage
anyway to keep the salvage terms as
high as possible he turned quickly to
the captain and with many sympa-
thetic words in tolerable english
sought to make him see that on ac-
count of the increasingly dangerous
position of the ship there was hardly
anything to do but accept the terms

  the agent who quite agreed with
this wanted for his part to add the
remark that unless an agreement
was reached wtithin an hour the
salvage steamer would be compelled
to sail as it did not under the
circumstances dare remain close to
the coast throughout the night
furthermore he wanted to say tliat
he could not for more than ten min-
utes consider himself bound by this
very favorable offer

  captain charles continued silent
he had put both short thick arms
on the table and looked from one to
the other of the two gentlemen with
slow understanding nods after
the agents last words his pale lips
trembled a bit then he turned to
the mate who had been present dur-
ing the negotiations as his witness
	world fiction

and asked for writing materials but without mary the poor child

              two hours later the  two sat on the edge of her bunk in her
brothers  was dragged from the own little cabin and stared in front
sand bar and found seaworthy in of her in the darkness with her
the dark stormy evening while round cat eyes she had read her
lights shone from the many small
huts in the village where they had
already begun to enjoy the third of
the salvage terms which was the
fishermens lawful share and where
the grocers booths and the inns
rooms were crowded with high-
voiced people the foreign ship
steamed lonesomely east and around
the point and out into the sea

it was the mates watch cap-
tain charles had shut himself in his
cabin with a new jug of whiskey-

 fate in the furious look with which
 her master had pushed her aside that
 afternoon her freedom was gone
 again  in the first harbor they
 touched he would send her back-
 home to the misery the hunger the
 dirt her fathers caning and her
 mothers curses

 madame augusta damanskaya was born in a picturesque
little village in the south of russia at the age of  she
married and went to petrograd to live before the war she
spent many years abroad especially in switzerland and italy
besides her own short stories novels and books of travel she
has translated some fifty volumes by foreign authors into

where she worked on a moscow newspaper and nursed in
the hospitals for the wounded she attempted to adjust her
life to the bolshevik regime but finding this impossible she
fed from russia in  disguised as a peasant she resides

                       one of these little ones
                       which believe in me it

st matthew xviii-

maria stepanovna os-

troukhova the wife of
the local priest who had
suddenly disappeared was still per-
mitted to occupy the parish house
but it was being made plain to her
on every convenient occasion that
she was merely suffered to remain
there the soviet authorities were
most anxious to find out where the
riest had gone and whether or not
is family was in communication
with him and why he did not return
if he really was not a counter-revo-
lutionist

  father nikolais successor the
church deacon and the elder of the
parish who was a local merchant
managed to keep on good terms with
the authorities and when the com-
missar a young lett mentioned in
a casual conversation once that it
would perhaps be a good idea to

remove the undesirable elements
from the church property the dea-
con who was a quickwitted and
clever fellow pretended that he had
not heard the pointed remark and
immediately proposed to the com-
missar in a most pleasant tone
did you say that you had not
found any quarters for the new sec-
retary yet well why not give him
a room at maria stepanovnas it
will make things rather cramped for
her but what of that the man
must have a place to stay

  the commissar looked at him in
astonishment the secretary in
question was one of the officials of
the chrezvychaika the extraordi-
nary commission that was the in
strument of the red terror and
none of the families in the city would
give him quarters while there were
no more dwellings left to requisi-
tion the deacon repeated again in
a tone of firm conviction

  the man must have a place to
stay

the commissar smiled with a
pleased air and the deacon went
over to maria stepanovnas house
in the sun-lit living room with its


o

world fiction

low ceiling old-fashioned furniture
and pots of rubber plants the miss-
ing priests eldest son fourteen-year-
old vadim was playing on an old
piano his crutch stood against the
chair on which he was sitting the
boy had a slight thin body crippled
by tuberculosis and a gentle delicate
face with sparkling blue eyes the
deacon paused in the doorway to lis-
ten to his playing and his face took
on an expression of pleasure the
boys fingers moved swiftly over the
yellow keys the loose strings
groaned their response and the ca-
nary bird in its cage tried to out-sing
the sounds of the piano and the boys
own clear voice

  mamma is over on the shore
the boy said shortly without rais-
ing his head and forestalling the dea-
cons inquiry

  the guest went to the fruit or-
chard through the dining room that
was immersed in greenish dusk be-
cause of the trees that grew close to
its windows he found maria
stepanovna on the high bank of the
river her four other boys were
with her the boys always played
together being only one year apart
in age and were once known all over
the neighborhood for their number-
less pranks now they were much
quieter and more sedate

  what is this you are drying
biscuits where did you get so
many asked the deacon in aston-
ishment after bowing respectfully
to maria stepanovna

  the woman blushed but the boys
began to explain interiupting each
other large quantities of biscuits
had been brought on a boat from
esthonia the day before and a good
many had been spilled into the mud
by the sailors as they unloaded the
boat the boys picked up the spill-
ings they were very dirty however
and had to be washed

   the deacon listened to them but
his eyes were gazing past their faces
then he bent aside the fold of his
old worn coat sat down on a rock
and glanced up and down the river
the broad stream was flowing by
serenely one side of the river re-
flected thegold of the sun while the
other was darkened by the shadows
of the fruit orchards that ran down
to its very shore the cupolas of
two monasteries were inverted in
the water the remnants of bridges
torn by shells rose in the air like
monstrous fragments but their re-
flections in the water were soft and
beautiful

   what a wonderful scene said
the deacon but finding no sympa-
thy either in maria stepanovna or
her sons he continued in a business-
like tone

   pretty soon it wont be necessary
for you to look for leavings i have
found you a lodger with a ration
that    phew    anybody would
be happy to have

   the woman who was still hand-
some with only faint traces of grey
in her luxuriant hair and youthful
blue eyes had no opportunity to ex-
press either pleasure or astonish-
ment when the deacon said

    the secretary of the chrezvy-
chaika

  maria stepanovnas hands
dropped to her sides the boys
opened their mouths as if by com-
mand but remained speechless

   you are joking father deacon
said the woman with gentle re-
proach

   the deacon rose from his rock
and made a hasty motion with his
hands

   not at all he is a good lodger
t am sure you will be thankful to
me afterward then he looked
around furtively and added in a low
voice but with great emphasis

and it will be much safer too be-
lieve me  know what i am talking

about

  father deacon tast week they
shot fifty people in the pskov prison
they dont even hide it they write
about it in the papers

   i read it myself said styopa
the eldest of the four in a strained
whisper gazing hard at the deacon

  sh-sh the deacon interrupted
him and again glanced around  it
is not our business to judge them
the lord will do that and the
secretary does not shoot people he
only writes papers besides i heard
from the surveyor who had some
business with him that he is really
a very pleasant fellow

he looked at the woman who
stood before him in utter confusion
her eyes full of dull fear and said
ii should advise you very strong-
ly to do it

   then he shook his head sadly as
if to make his disapproval of her
indecision more apparent

  suddenly all four of the boys
jumped up from the ground and
their bare feet flashed through the
air they ran off to tell vadim all
about it rushing into the living
room they shouted in unison

  we are getting a lodger from
the chrezwchaika

  the cripple was playing a com-
plicated tune in a high key but he
immediately broke it off the ca-
nary too stopped singing he lis-
tened with apparent indifference to
the story his four brothers tried to
tell him all talking at the same time
then sent them to the devil with an
incredulous air and resumed his
playing the canary immediately
broke into a frenzied accompani-
ment

    wo days later the secretary of
the chrezvychaika moved into ma-
ria stepanovnas house he was a

tall young man with slightly stoop-
ing shoulders a pimply chin short
and flat nose grey watery eyes and
smoothly brushed hair he talked
in a rather deep voice and looked
at you shyly as he spoke he was
not terrible in the least the boys
who helped him take his things from
the wagon to the house liked him
in five minutes time he knew them
all by name never making a mistake
while they called him ivan petro-
vich as though they had known him
for years

  maria stepanovna conducted her-
self with careful dignity while va-
dim went ott to see a friend and did
not return until late at night when
he could slip unseen into his tiny
dark room adjoining the bedroom
which was occupied by maria step-
anovna and the four younger boys

  before he had time to undress
his mother called to him softly he
came into her room where all four
of the younger boys were already
seated on her bed

  sit down said maria stepanov-
na and drawing her son toward
her she passed the palm of her hand
over his moist forehead- have
you eaten

  yes replied the boy scarcely
making a sound

  dont fool now said the moth-
er and her voice broke into a short
sob

  she put her hand over her mouth
to fight back the sob and then be-
gan to speak in a whisper it was
dark in the room save for the un-
certain light of a small red lamp
birds were fluttering lightly in the
nests under the roof the branches
of the birches just outside the win-
dow were scratching the window-
panes

  marta stepanovna and her bovs
sat huddled together and talked in
soft whispers they were care-
 

world fiction

fully working out a plan of action

  not a word about father hes
disappeared thats all we dont
know anything about him

  lets say that the whites
dragged him away with them when
they were leaving suggested one
of the boys

  vadim pressed the boys arm just
above the elbow and hissed

   dont lie i

  yes better dont and dont
say anything thats not necessary
said the mother hes gone dis-
appeared thats all and if he
asks how we live just say we get
rations and sell our old things
you have to say that we ex-
change them said eleven-year-old

styopa with utmost earnestness i
you say sell them they might get you
for speculating

  the way they got lyoshas aunt
and sent her to prison for a whole
month added tyoma sleepily

  all right we exchange our old
things on the market place

  let him look whispered sty-
opa exultantly

  and another thing maria
stepanovna found in the darkness
vadims hot dry hand and pressed
it dont lets talk about the bol-
sheviki and things like that no
discussions at all

  they all agreed silently vadim
slowly withdrew his hand and whis-
pered to his mother

 
the soviet priestlings



  if i could id go away too over
to where papa is

  he picked up his crutch the
mother caught his sleeve and made
the sign of the cross over him in the
darkness the younger boys rolled
off the mothers bed and disappeared
in their own

  the following morning as maria
stepanovna and her children were
having their breakfast which con-
sisted mostly of a kind of coffee
made or oats the lodger came to the
door of the dining room and hesi-
tating on the threshold said pleas-
antly 

  may i come in

  the boys glanced at each other
quickly vadim caught up his
crutch but his mother held him in
his place with a glance then she
said politely

  please do i

  ivan petrovich came into the
room shook hands with everybody
and sat down in response to maria
stepanovnas silent invitation then
he began

  i want to see you about some-
thing you see    i   well at any
rate i cant stand the bread they
give you on card rations he made
a gesture of contempt in the direc-
tion of the grey lumps that lay on
the table and went under the name
of bread over in tver where i
served before i had an arrange-
ment with my landlady i got
enough flour to make decent bread
of and she used to bake bread for
me and get a part of it for herself
cant we make the same sort of ar-
rangement the flour i get is first
rate

  maria stepanovna blushed the
boys glanced at the mother and re-
mained silent vadim sat with his
eyes fixed on the torn oilcloth that
covered the table

  i am not sure i can bake bread

said maria stepanovna undecidedly

 we have no servants nowadays
you know

  the lodger shrugged his shoul-
ders made a motion with his hands
to express half-offense half-surprise
and said

   but its for your own good and
for the children too

  and then he again cast a con-
temptuous look at the lumps on the
table that had a sharp sour smell

  maria stepanovna hastily con-
sented ivan petrovich immediate-
ly suggested that she go and see his
supplies two of the bovs followed
her and came back in extreme ex-
citement 

  you ought to see the things he
has there

   packages as large as this and
styopa spread his hands wide to in-
dicate the size of the packages that
held the lodgers supplies

  vadim sat at the table scratch-
ing the cover with his nails then
he rose from his seat and went out
into the garden

  maria stepanovna came out of
her lodgers room with a number of
packages in her hands that day
at dinner the boys noticed a differ-
ence in the taste of the soup and
gruel which they received every day
from the soviet food station the
food looked as it always did yet
there was something in it that made
it taste better the mother smiled
on them and urged them to cat more
especially her eldest boy the crip-
ple styopa was the first to realize
what it was that made the differ-
ence suddenly he cried out

  ah ivan petrovich must have
given you some butter to fix this stuff
up i noticed there was something
different

  vadim pushed his plate away and
rose from the table his mother
called after him but he walked out


world fiction

of the room without turning around

  the bread-baking was a splendid
success the familys share was
four pounds and a part of it was
used with the evening tea vadim
took a small piece of bread and put
it in his mouth then he stretched
his hand for the slice which the
mother had pushed in his direction
as he ate his eyes became curtained
as with a mist which dissolved in its
dullness the heat of their blue
sparkle

  in the evening a number of
friends came to visit ivan petrovich
and styopa and kolya were sent
somewhere with a note they came
back bringing with them a long
package tied with a string and sealed
with wax having delivered the
package they rushed into the
kitchen shut the door carefully and
began to whisper to their mother

  mamma its wine its wine

  maria stepanovna told them to
be still

  nonsense dont you dare talk
about it the neighbors might hear
  

  she put her children to bed early

  late that night after an evening
of loud conversation and laughter
the guests in the lodgers room be-
gan to sing then the sound of
opening bottles came from the room

  vadim was tossing restlessly from
side to side on his narrow bed his
mother went into his room and seat-
ed herself beside him he took her
hand and pressed it to his moist fore-
head

  mother they shouldnt do it
do you hear what they are singing
its dastardly

  maria stepanovna laid her head
on his pillow

  dont mind them my darling
dont listen to them let them


  vadims hand touched her check

and a hot tear glided down his fin-
ger he said nothing only pressed
himself closer to his mother and
passed his hand again and again
over her cheeks her hair her shoul-
ders they remained together un-
til sleep began to overcome them

   the next morning ivan petrovich
called the four boys into his room
red and confused they stood before
him stepping from one bare foot to
the other as he was saying to them
take it take it all ill have to
give it away to somebody i dont
want any more

   his pimples had swollen up dur-
ing the night and his eyes showed
signs of the spree he was yawn-
ing as he sat at the table still half-
dressed and talked to the four boys
to whom he was offering the re-
mains of the feast

   the large slice of cake with ber-
ries the fresh sausages the box of
candies a plate of jelly-all luxu-
ries which millions of russian citi-
zens now recall merely as far-off joys
-drew the boys eyes like a magnet
their lips quivered and some power
seemed to push their hands away
from their bodies and toward the
table

  well

   his voice took on a tone of im-
patience and the imperious quality
of command

   styopa was the first to stretch his
hand shyly toward the table the
others followed ivan petrovich
gave them all there was

   as the boys were trooping out of
the room muttering thank you
to him ivan petrovich suddenly
stopped them with a question
and where is that proud brother
of yours

the two older boys looked at him
in sudden fright but ivan petro-
vich merely yawned again and said
oh let him go to    ill
the soviet priestlings



get something else for him   
well we are going back to bed

  he stretched himself yawned
shut the door and a few minutes
later loud snores began to come
from his room

  vadim had gone with his mother
to the early church services he
returned alone with a troubled
pained look on his face then
as he saw the things on the table
his face suddenly took on an expres-
sion of anticipation and greed

  where did it come from where
did it come from  he was asking
eagerly pretending he did not know

  the boys pointed in the direction
of the lodger s room but at that mo-
ment the mothers voice was heard
from the kitchen they all went to
her maria stepanovnas face was
ashen and her hands shook as she
took off her old hat vadim went
close to her and his face became pale
once more

  i heard what they said to you
he whispered brokenly looking
straight into her face

  let me alone

  the children gathered into a
group and watched the scene anx-
iously

   you    you  maria step-
anovna did not finish the sentence
but turned around and went into her
bedroom

  the children went over to va-
dim

  i know whispered styopa i
heard the deacons wife talking at
the well when i was getting water
 the other boys stood in silence
vadims hand was clutching convul-
sively at the ectae of the table

    they shot nve last night they
his guests    the deacons wife
said they arrested 

  come to the table children
the mothers voice sounded unusual-
ly loud as she said these words

styopa carried the samovar the
others followed him

  are these things from ivan
petrovich asked maria stepanov-
na with unnatural simplicity in her
voice gazing past the children and
past the array of delectable dishes

  they ate in silence munching each
piece for a long time vadim was
the last to succumb to the tempta-
tion of the luxuries at first he
started on the grey soup and sour
bread but in a few minutes his
hand stretched almost involuntarily
toward the other dishes he raised
his eyelids heavily as after a long
illness or a long sleep the others
did not look at him he swallowed
one bite then another before long
he was eating with the rest

  thats enough children we
ought to leave some of that sausage
for tomorrow said maria stepa-
novna in a low voice she sat in
her chair with drooping shoulders
wiping the perspiration off her face
with a colored handkerchief sty-
opa brushed his lips with the palm
of his hands and said

  that sausage must have cost at
least twenty thousand and where
did he get it

  take this plate to the cellar
said his mother in a loud voice
hastily trying to cover up the boys
words and get ready for church
all of you 

  the boys began moving back
their chairs making signs of the
cross vadim too raised his hand
to cross himself but as though some-
thing had burnt him he tore his
fingers away from his forehead
then he bent his head low groped
for his crutch and went out into the
garden maria stepanovna rose
from her chair but dropped down
into it again immediately as if she
did not have the strength to stand
up her elbows on the table


world fiction

she dropped her head on her hands
and remained motionless

  the sound of church chimes
brought her to her feet however a
few minutes later first she raised
her head listening intently to the
ringing that spread out like slowly
expanding circles as the brass re-
verberations struck each other in
the air and rebounded into space
then she moved back her chair
noisily and went into the kitchen

  she had just struck a match to
light a fire in the stove when ivan
petrovich appeared in the narrow
door leading from the hall he
was still only half dressed his
cheeks nose and lips showed signs
of his recent heavy stupor-like sleep
with the fingers of his right hand he
brought together the collar of his
blue shirt which was unbuttoned and
open wide as he came in

   beg pardon    may i get
some water 

  maria stepanovna did not raise
her head but continued her efforts
to light the thin twigs that the boys
had gathered for kindling

   the morning services must be
over what asked ivan petrovich
with a pleasant smile then glanc-
ing at the sizzling wood in the stove
he added with sincere sympathy
do they call that wood and
how much of that precious stuff
have you 

  none at all replied maria
stepanovna in a low hollow voice
weve borrowed this from the
neighbors

   but what will you do this win-
ter asked ivan petrovich and his
tone showed such concern that one
might have thought the matter af-
fected his close friends or blood rela-
tions maria stepanovna shrugged
her shoulders

  then ivan petrovich dropped the
ends of his collars which he had been

holding until then massaged for a
moment his hair chest with one
hand as he slapped his thigh with
the other

  this will never do he an-
nounced with emphasis

  he looked at maria stepanovna
in silence for a moment and then
said in the tone of a man who had
found the solution of a difficult prob-
lem 

  never mind well get some
wood ill get an order to-morrow
ive got a friend one of the fellows
who were here last night 

  maria stepanovnas hand sudden-
ly remained motionless in the air
while he became silent

  thank you said the woman
her voice even more hollow than a
few minutes before how can i
take it from a stranger besides 

  she could not continue but rais-
ing her head she met the mans
glance that was gliding greedily over
her bare neck and shoulder then
she suddenly stepped back to the
door her face hushed

  he is a most accommodating
fellow this polikarpvch said ivan
petrovich in an unnaturally loud
tone of voice as his trembling fin-
gers buttoned and again unbuttoned
his shirt collar they say all sorts
of things about him in the city but
its all lies dont pay any atten-
tion to it he is just a party man
same as i

  maria stepanovna opened her
mouth as if to ask a question but
merely caught her breath and the
man his glance still glued to her
body answered her unuttered ques-
tion 

  of course being in a responsible
position he has to look after
things

  and then he continued avoiding
the heavy stare of her darkened
eyes
the soviet priestlings

 

  weve been together for a long
time under the old regime we
both worked in the same place then
we were in the same company dur-
ing the war his father used to be
a merchant but now he is a commis-
sar at toroptsa and i tell you he
is in the right place too his face
lighted up with a sensuous smirk
as he snapped his lingers and con-
tinued arid my old man has re-
mained a regular bourgeois he
was a court watchman before and
now that theyve done away with
courts he got himself the watch-
mans job at the cemetery looks
after the dead

  he again passed his hand over his
hairy chest and repeated the prom-
ise 

  youll have the wood and no
trouble at all

  then he smiled pleasantly got
himself a pitcher of water and went
back to his room

  before the week was out two cart
loads of wood were delivered to the
parish house and as they were be-
ing unloaded several pairs of eyes
full of malice astonishment and
envy watched the process from the
windows of the neighboring houses

  in the evening of that day im-
mediately after the lodger dressed
in new american shoes and coat
went out of the house the deacon
came in he did not greet maria
stepanovna as was his custom he
did not even sit down throwing a
sharp glance at the woman he in-
quired 

  well how are things

  maria stepanovna quickly bent
over the table as if to hide with her
own body the shirt she was making
out of a piece of calico but the
deacon noticed the goods

  i see vou have some new calico
there  where did you get it he
asked in astonishment

  i am making a shirt for vadim
the lodger got it for me an-
swered maria stepanovna without
raising her head her lips white he
hasnt any change at all when 
wash his rags he has to go naked
the deacon drummed on the table
with his fingers

  s-so and i hear you got some
wood too enough for the whole
winter i understand

   yes i did get it replied maria
stepanovna and this time there was
a challenging note in her voice

  the thump of vadims crutch be-
came audible on the steps

   its my ration she said sud-
denly i have entered the service
the needle which was dancing in
her hand missed the seam and went
deep into her thumb she drew it
out sucked the blood and then held
her thumb tight in the other hand

  the service where the
deacons voice was low almost sol-
emn as he asked these questions
trying hard to control his excitement

  the municipal economic com-
mittee she replied distinctly the
rations there 

  she did not finish vadim ambled
heavily into the room his crutch
struck the floor with such loud
thumping that it seemed a dozen
cripples were hurrying somewhere in
helpless haste his eyes were wild
and his sallow face glistened with
hot perspiration as he began to talk
in a loud breaking raucous voice
and they didnt give you
enough over at the zavelchye
where i was to-day they gave every-
body in the municipal committee-
three cart loads and ten yards of
cloth yes yes i saw it myself
you dont believe me he turned
angrilv and passionately to the dea-
con  i saw it myself 

  his voice broke completely a
bubbling sound came from his


world fiction

throat the crutch slipped from un-
der his arm and fell noisily to the
floor maria stepanovna caught
her son just in time and led him to
a chair then placing herself be-
fore the boy she threw a glance of
entreaty at the deacon he under-
stood pushing his worn hat low
on his forehead he turned around
and walked out in silence

  vadim my vadim whispered
maria stepanovna bending over her
boy

  he threw her hand off his shoul-
der snatched the cloth from the
table and tore it into shreds be-
fore his mother could stop him

  at that moment the four boys
rushed into the room eager to relate
some piece of news they stopped
short on the threshold and shyly
crowded around their mother and
brother who by that time had de-
veloped a violent fit

  only after vadim had fallen
asleep on his mothers bed with a
wet towel on his head did the boys
have an opportunity to tell their
mother what had happened

  misha golovkin and yura and
the ushkov girls 

  wouldnt play with us any-
more 

  they drove us from the play-
grounds 

  they call us soviet priestlings
and all sorts of names 

  tyoma began to weep mitya
the youngest covered his face with
his mothers apron styopa clenched
his fists as he threatened to punish
the offenders

  maria stepanovna her face mo-
tionless as if made of wood her
arms moving mechanically like those
of a toy doll tore herself away from
them took a pot from the stove
filled four plates with the unsavory
gruel and said sharply

  now eat and go to bed

    the next sunday vadim rose late
 the house was very quiet only the
 canary bird was moving about in its
 cage he dressed himself and went
  into the dining room plates filled
 with delicious food again stood on
 the table the odors drew him ir-
 resistibly he had his breakfast
 alone

   then he paused in the open door
 of the lodgers room something
 out of the ordinary glistened on a
 small table between two rubber
 plants he walked over to the
 table and sat down in a chair which
 seemed to have been placed there
 as if on purpose then he drew
 his fingers across the strings of a
 shining new mandolin he shut his
 eyes and began to play he did
 not hear the footsteps of ivan pet-
 rovich as the lodger entered the
 room then he realized his pres-
 ence and the sounds broke off sharp-
 ly his face reddened in confusion
 as he held the mandolin out to ivan
 petrovich

   i beg your pardon i  i
 just played a little  i

   ivan petrovich laughed good-na-
 turedly

   dont apologize its for you
 anyway a sort of a surprise play
 as much as you want to

   vadim rose from his chair and
 sat down again he wanted to say
 something and could not utter a
 word he merely moved his head
 from side to side and stared at ivan
 petrovich with his blazing eyes
 only after the man repeated a num-
 ber of times that the mandolin was
 to be vadims property for ever
 and ever the boy suddenly rose to
 his feet extended his hand to ivan
 petrovich and said with sincere
 gratitude just as his father had
 taught him when he was a child
 thank you thank you very
 much
the soviet priestlings



  at that moment the boys rushed
into the room they had known all
about the mandolin the night before
now they surrounded vadim who
held the mandolin gently pressed to
his heart they were all still hap-
pily talking about the mandolin oc-
casionally touching carefully its
sweetly tinkling strings when maria
stepanovna returned from church

  that day ivan petrovich dined
with the whole family the conver-
s a t i o n revolved
all the time about
the new mando-
lin until styopa
asked ivan petro-
vich 

  where did you
get it it must
have cost at least
fifty thousand
didnt it 

  ivan petrovichs
face changed
quickly and a
shadow of disqui-
etude passed over
it but he replied with a smile

  i got it thats enough 
maria stepanovna looked intent-
ly at her lodger and turned her
glance away vadim rose from the
table impatiently and went into the
garden with his mandolin the boys
soon followed him

  where did you get the mando-
lin ivan petrovich  asked maria
stepanovna in a low but distinct
voice looking straight into the mans
eyes

   what difference does it make 
he held her eyes steadily and his
voice sounded as though he were
saying what business is it of
yours 

  maria stepanovna remained si-
lent then rubbed her hands as if
they were cold and lowered her
head

   it must have belonged to some
one    who isnt in this world
now she whispered

  nonsense said ivan petro-
vich rising from the table  some-
body must have been telling you tales
again 

  maria stepanovna interrupted
him

   its a sin to do that to vadim
   lie is 

   whats happened anyway

somebody must
have been telling
you  he
did not finish
again

  the thumping
of vadims crutch
came from the gar-
den maria ste-
panovna ran to
her bedroom just
as the boy came
into the room
holding his man-
dolin under his
arm he walked
over to ivan petrovich and said in
a ringing voice	

   i wanted  i have a rather
good handwriting everybody
praises it if you have anything to
copy or something like that id be
very glad to do it his glance
strayed caressingly to the mandolin
as he repeated  very glad

  ivan petrovich merely waved his
hand and said

   nonsense its only a trifle

anyway

  he smiled in rather a confused
manner and went to his room
vadim remained still for a moment
then walked over to his mothers
room the door was locked

  he sat down on the old torn couch
and closed his eyes wearily

   several days later just before an
important church holiday the four


world fiction

boys who sang in the church choir
were in the living room practicing
choral singing styopa played the
accompaniment on the old piano
while vadim strummed the melody
on the mandolin beating time with
their hands the boys were singing
the cherubims song

   fine said ivan petrovich
coming out of his room  now try
this and he began to hum a tune
without any words

  styopas sensitive ear caught the
melody and his fingers quickly found
the notes the other three of the
boys also began to hum it and the
mandolin too passed from the
melody of the cherubims song to
that of the communist hymn the in-
ternationale ivan petrovich sang
louder and louder adding words to
the lilt of the melody  the battle
decisive and final 

  vadim heard only the golden
sounds of his mandolin styopa
pressed the pedal in an effort to add
more power to the strange melody
but the younger boys began to catch
the words and sang changing the
unusual words but slightly for
with the internationale mankind will
rise to life 

   please dont  the chorus be-
came silent and the sounds of the
mandolin broke off in the door of
the living room stood maria ste-
panovna with a tired and troubled
expression on her face  please

dont  she repeated and went into
the kitchen

  ivan petrovich followed her

   you can hear it in the street
maria stepanovna was saying to her
lodger in the kitchen and her voice
expressed bitter reproach  as it
is they all point their fingers at
us   w

    you just spit at them all said
ivan petrovich and then added mer-
rily and ive got something for
you too boys bring that yellow
package from my room 

  vadim followed them to the
kitchen they all surrounded maria
stepanovna and gazed with rapture
at the butter cheese and flour that
emerged from the yellow wrapping
paper

    my what cheese cake that will
make said styopa and tyoma
winking his eyes as if trying to recall
something added just the kind
we had that time when papa 

  he did not finish however for
just at that moment maria ste-
panovnas keys fell to the floor and
the boys all ran over to pick them up

  maria stepanovna threw a quick
glance at vadim he was staring at
the butter and the cheese and his
dry pale lips were parted by a smile
then she turned to her lodger and
said

   thank you ivan petrovich
thank you it will make excellent
cake now lets all have tea

                        by

                   aluizio azevedo

              from the portuguese brazil by joseph e agan

    aluizio de azevedo was born in the early sixties in the maranhense desert in
brazil lie was one of a group of young intellectuals engaged in combating slavery
an institution which existed in brazil until j his first book  o mulato produced
when he was only twenty had the effect of uncle toms cabin on the tottering
planter regime azevedo was not the stuff evangelists are made of however he soon j
abandoned the ranks of the abolitionists becoming a prominent figure in the boh mian
group at rio de janeiro that was to produce most of what is worth while in brazilian g
vtiers zola was his master and most oj his novels are pitiless studies of reality his 
best work  a womans tear  has its gentler moments in his later years he was his g
countrys consular representative in europe and japan he died in 

en louis

  they were all he had left
these few coins were all that
remained of a large and famous
fortune that had been handed down
a line of noble ancestors to him the
last of his family ten louis

  dom felippe juggled the glitter-
ing gold pieces in his hand as he
walked slowly toward the spot
where half an hour before he had
abandoned the roulette

  leaning against the back of his
still vacant chair he glanced down at
the green table with cold indifferent
eyes the numbers were buried in
the gold and silver of other players

  he remained motionless for a
long time and stared with unseeing
eyes at the silver wheel his senses
were concentrated on a single
thought that burned in his brain-
he must recover that squandered
fortune or at least a part of it
with a hundred thousand fiancs a
mere hundred thousand be could
save himself the disgrace of ruin
with a hundred thousand francs he
would hasten to paris and pay his
debts of honor then under some
pretext or other possibly that of

health he would pretend a trip to
switzerland and sail for america
with what money he had left in
america fortunes were contagious
one discovered fabulous dowries
if he were finally obliged to work
-he would work

  he did not know what work he
would do but the new world swam
before his credulous eyes in a
golden haze no definite plan or
idea accompanied this hope he be-
lieved in america as he believed in
cards or the roulette it was a gam-
blers last hope it was a blind
leap in the dark would not
america also be a green table piled
high with california gold it was
the card flung in the last desperate
play

  he would go

  and afterwards how fine it
would be to return to europe many
times a millionaire and still young
to revel unrestrained

  while these air castles mounted
higher and higher in his feverish
imagination the wheel spun swiftly
and silently and heaps of gold and
silver poured along the table before
his distracted eyes

   but if i should lose m he asked
himself

  he dared not imagine the situa-
tion that this questions answer
would make inevitable he felt that
he had compromised his honor by
the very thought

   nevertheless if he lost that miser-
able handful of coins what remained
for him but    suicide what
remained for him in this world if it
were not ridicule and humiliation

  he saw himself penniless creep-
ing like a shadow through the dark
streets his head on his breast and
his hands plunged into his pockets
fleeing from the sight of everyone
and conscious that his abject misery
made him as abhorrent as though
he had a contagious disease a cold
sweat oozed over his skin and he
shivered

  cowardly means of salvation that
stole into his distracted mind re-
calling rich friends and questionable
resources were repelled instantly by
his pride which still remained un-
broken

   faites vos jeux messieurs 
cried the banker

  dom felippe smiled a sad re-
signed smile as if in response to an
inner voice that appealed to his
courage and after shaking the ten
gold pieces once more he opened his
delicate useless hand and with an
air haughtier and more indifferent
than ever threw them on the red sec-
tion which was nearest him

   rien tie va plus 

  a vertigo threatened his feigned
calm

  the small ivory sphere sprang
from the bankers dextrous fingers
and whirled around the top of the
bowl the silence of death reigned
in the room

  if on that throw instead of red
black should come up the wretched
gambler reflected any beggar in the

streets would be richer than he

  the ball began to slacken its
speed and hovered above the circle
of numbers ready to fall

  the noble slid into a chair and
rested his head in his rigid blood-
less hands

  the ball dropped

  red

  dom felippes ten louis became
twenty he made not the slightest
gesture but awaited the next throw
apparently indifferent

  the table was swept clean and
covered again with glittering stakes
the banker closed the bets the ball
shot out fell

  red again

  dom felippe did not remove his
hands from his face on his twenty
louis were placed another twenty

  the game continued in silence

  in the midst of the mute anguish -
that reigned in the hearts of all who
played a third red number doubled
the stakes of dom felippe who con-
tinued immobile as stone

  none the less so pronounced was
the rise and fall of his breast that
his whole body accompanied the
pulsations of his heart

  red

  eighty louis were poured upon
the eighty in front of the silent
player

  red

  the gold began to form a heap

  red again i

  the pile of gold was on a tower-
ing level with that enigmatic face
which gradually retreated behind
those two white hands with their
delicately traced blue veins

   red still

  that imperturbable face now
seemed petrified behind the stiff 
thin fingers he seemed to be laugh-
ing sardonically at the other players

  the immobility and the luck of
the last throw



this singular companion in vice be-
gan to attract attention

  redl

  by this time the other men and
women could not take their eyes
from that mysterious individual
whose face none of them had
recognized yet so absorbed had
each been in his own game

  red red

  the mountain of gold kept
rising rising and
rising before
those two hands
that seemed each
moment whiter
stiffer and more
firmly planted
against the un-
known gamblers
face

red red red

 the coins
crept under his
arms fell to his
lap through his
legs and rolled
across the flooi
with a ringing
sound

  red

  the others
abandoned their own games to
watch this remarkable player hop-
ing that the two marble hands would
be lowered that the mocking mask
would fall revealing his identity

  each throw doubled the wealth
piled before that deathlike figure
in vain a beautiful soubrctte at his
side leaned against him suggestively
in vain did a group of women form
behind his chair talking loudly and
betting at each new lucky throw
whether or no he would stake every-
thing again

  now when red was announced by
the bankers tremulous voice a roar
of astonishment would rise in the
room

  the tympan clamored continu-
ously for attention and order

  but the comments redoubled
about that mute statue some
protested against his impertinent
madness begging for a black num-
ber as deserved punishment others
applauded him enthusiastically and
shouted bravos at each turn of the
wheel still others calculated the ac-
cumulated gold by counting the
plays

  each time the
ball dropped
there rose a
chorus of con-
flicting emotions
of approval and
disappointment

  finally the
banker pale and
trembling
swayed against
the edge of the
table and moaned
in the despairing
voice of a drown-
ing shipwrecked
sailor

  the bank
   has gone to
glory 

  but not even then did the myste-
rious player make the slightest
gesture although around him
gathered the curious debauchees of
both sexes and all nations forming a
noisy tempestuous wall

  they shouted at him from all
sides in all languages and in all
tones

  fie did not move

  they tapped his shoulders they
touched hi head

  to no avail

  they shook his chair

  the statue remained motionless

  then two men each taking one of
the nobles hands tore them away
from his face and a third raised


world fiction

his head which was sunken on his
breast

  a cry of horror rose from the on-
lookers

  he who had broken the bank and
played in silence all night enticed 
by the women and envied by the
men was a frozen corpse with wide
staring eyes half-open mouth and on

his stiffened chceks two silent tears

  the three men drew back in
terror and the dead gambler fell
against the table burying his face
and hands in the gold as if to defend
his gains against the greed of the
surviving players who were already
protesting in loud voices against the
legitimacy of his possession

from sky-blue sea to sea-blue sky
in steps the city mounts on high

but pausing now and then to rest
on a cool and cloistered plazas breast

as struggles the ass beneath its load
tortured by blasphemy and goad

so doth this city seem to climb
in laboured strides beyond the slime
that laps its languid feet until
it stands upon the highest hill

lifting its arms in a vain quest
to join the city of the blest

what visioned monk or brother friar
struggling toward his hearts desire
first looked beyond the sin and vice
and saw the vale of paradise

  although he was only

    eighteen years old his shoul-
    ders were so broad that they
    darkened the room when he sidled
    through the doorway of the tavern
    and his feet with long flexible
    toes and strong round ankles as
    arm as screws denoted even in re-
    pose the ability to run like the wind
    across the brown heath or to tramp
    during long hours on sandy paths
    steadily and untiringly under a
    heavy load

     he walked with a slight stoop
   and his eyes seemed to be eagerly
   searching the distance this was a

i habit which had become second na-
   ture with him during his career as
   a smuggler he had belonged to the
   gang since his tenth year from the
   sordidness of the hovel where his
   teeming family lived from the
   swearing the blows the hunger of
   many for the mouthful which was
   insufficient for one he cscaped to the
   wide freedom of the forest and the
   comradeship of the jolly smugglers
   who gave him drink and sometimes
   exen money when he darted noise-
   lessly as a squirrel through the
   underbrush and warned the troop of
   the dolice lying in ambush



  with curses and threats and a
whipping because of the few cents
he had made for himself his father
would bring him back and send him
out into the streets on an errand
which should bring either gain or
more blows but he never failed to
make his way back to the hidden
path and the gang and finally to the
tavern where he obtained pork and
potatoes and a glass of beer

  gradually he grew to be at home
in the woods as much as the squir-
rels and the crows that build their
black nests among the branches as
much as the rabbits that burrow in
the sandhills warmed by the morn-
ing sun he knew every covert
every hidden path through the low
thick brushwood every warm hol-
low where there was a good bed of
dried ferns and brown leaves he
roamed about in all kinds of
weather fair and foul gazing at
the blue summer skies which look
purple between the dark tops of the
firs or letting the rain run down his
neck wading through the snow and
struggling against the wild winds in
early spring day and night were
alike to him so he grew up and be-
came a lean strong being going
 

world fiction

out to seek his prey and returning
satisfied to sleep now and then
the rising temper of his youth would
burst out at some rollicking drink-
ing party or a fight in which blows
fell alike on friend and foe

  since he had grown stronger he
too carried his load-sacks of salt
of increasing weight on shoulders
which broadened every day finally
by some kind of silent general elec-
tion he became the leader of the
gang

  he had never been caught and
the thought gave him real pleasure
after some particularly daring
smuggling feat he would enter the
tavern where the customs officers
were drying their muddy boots and
torn wet uniforms before the fire
grouchy and fagged like hounds
after a vain chase rattling the
newrly gained money in his pockets
he would ask the pretty lass behind
the counter for a tot o gin

   heres to the health of the offi-
cers eh janie and hopin as how
theyll learn to use their eyes
better

  as he swallowed the drink he
winked at the giggling girl and

f lanced at the officers who scowled
uriously in payment he tossed a
rijksdaalder on the counter with
the words

   got change for that i aint

  rijkxdaalder-a dutch silver coin worth
 about one dollar

got nothin smaller its a flush
day

   and in the doorway he turned
round once more with a laugh
which showed all his fine white
teeth and said

    if yuh catch me ill treat yuh
 all

   and so it had been going for
the last three years

   one night in a raw december
storm the salt smugglers were again
on their trail through the woods
one man behind the other back
bent barefoot and silent nellis
was leading they were on the third
leg of their trip from the belgian
frontier they were scratched and
bleeding from the sharp twigs which
lashed them in the storm and the
ripe open pine cones under their
naked feet their shoulders creaked
under the load of wet salt chilled
to the bone weary and stiff they
labored on

   nellis turned  keep a look-out
 boys 

   in the same instant they were sur-
 rounded by dark forms

    halt or i fire i give me the
 lantern i 

   quick as lightning nellis brought
 the full weight of his sack to bear
 on the man who carried the light
 throwing him to the ground but at
 the same time he was pulled over
nellis



backwards and four men fell on him

  the officers clung to the smug-
gler like hounds to their quarry
they rolled together in a heap on
the ground torn by the stumps and
stems with which they came in sharp
contact nellis made no sound in
grim silence he wrestled against the
bodies which fastened on to him
lighting wildly like a madman with
fists and feet with a desperate
eltort he got on his feet tore him-
self free and ran

  a shot rang after him then a
second but darting behind a pile of
wood he leaped and bounded over
felled trees over hollows and
ditches into the thick forest he
did not stop until he heard the sound
of the shots grow faint then he
fell exhausted on the ground

  he panted the night air through
his parched throat shaking under
the thumping of his quickened heart-
beats fie felt as if his head would
burst the darkness whirled around
him he pressed his clenched fists
to his temples and found the warm
blood oozing down on one side from
under his matted hair it flowed
faster and warmer down the side
of his nose and into his mouth with
a sickly taste carefully he felt the
wound and it smarted under his
touch across his forehead and skull

  nellis was afraid what if he
should faint here and be found at
daylight by the officers he stood
up dizzily holding to a tree with one
hand while he pressed the other
against the wound he tried to
think where he was

  a faint light visible through the
striped darkness of the pine forest
and the sound of constant murmur-
ing which he distinguished between
the roaring of the wind indicated
to him where the stream ran along
the edge of the w-oods he knew an
uninhabited house there not far dis-

tant he had once slept there safely
all day long beside the salt bags of
the gang while the officers searched
the neighborhood he saw the
house outlined like a black moun-
tain secure in the storm-flayed grey
fields stumbling and falling over
fern roots he made for it limping
for he had sprained his right foot
in flight

  the window through which he
hoped to climb in was closed with a
shutter and seemed bolted but the
door of the bam was ajar the
rusty hinges creaked behind him
and then all was still

  the storm had heaped up the
dead leaves in a corner he
crouched down on them  they
cant swear it was me he thought
with a smugglers knowledge of the
law that reassured him but he
felt himself growing dizzy and sin-
gularly light headed he tried to
stanch the blood with a strip which
he tore from his shirt he could
hardly lift his arms and the pain
was so intense that he groaned
then he heard steps approaching
the door of the barn

  instinctively nellis tried to rise
to run no matter where but he
could not get on his feet and he
crept back into the corner as far as
possible against the wall this was
undoubtedly the end

  the door opened and showed a
flickering yellow light which moved
uncertainly to and fro it was an
old man carrying a stable lantern
in his hand the wind ruffled his
long thin grey hair and tugged at
the robe which he had hastily
donned

   i certainly thought  he
muttered as he raised the lantern
just then he caught sight of the pale
blood-stained face and the scared
angrv eyes in the corner he said
calmly


world fiction

   you are wounded come and
i will help you

  and seeing how weak the man
was he approached him helped him
to his feet and supported him to
the house and into a dimly lighted
room

   sit here for the present he
said leading nellis to a sofa  and
stay quiet till i return

  nellis was as docile as a child
he was quite stunned the old man
returned with a grumbling refrac-
tory maidservant who said over and
over again	

   now this is what youre al-
ways doing dominie 

  however she helped him wash
the blood from nelliss face and
hair and place a wet bandage
around his head the old man took
a blanket from the bed which stood
in the corner of the room and cov-
ered his guest with it

  now go to sleep tomorrow
we will call the doctor

  then he lay down shivering on
the bed and drew his dressing-
gown about him and the grumbling
maid placed the oil lamp so that its
light could disturb neither her mas-
ter nor the patient and wrent away

   nellis lay perfectly still with his
knees drawn up to keep from sliding
off the smooth horsehair couch he
was afraid the night-light behind
the porcelain shade the bed with
the green curtains in large folds the
rugs the couch on which he lay-
the rich folks furnishings in a room
which he had always seen with
nothing but cobwebs in the corners
all this alarmed him

  but particularly the old man who
had so suddenly made his appear-
ance and had brought him here-he
was especially afraid of him did
he want to keep him here and mean-
time warn the police he raised
himself on one elbow and looked

inquiringly at the man sleeping in
the green bed lie did not stir the
old sunken face lay still with
closed eyes and parted lips the
sheet moved slightly over his chest
with his regular breathing nellis
looked at him for some time then
he let himself slip back cautiously
stretched out his legs as far as the
couch would permit and slept

   he was startled by a voice in his
 ear and a grip on his wrist he
 resisted

   not so rough said the voice
  wo men were standing by his
 couch one of them was the old man
 of the night before the other re-
 tained his hold on his wrist and said
 to the old man

    you have here a strange guest
 dominie

   the dominie made some remark
about losing the way and an acci-
dent in the dark and the other
sneered and began to loosen the
bandage when he saw the wound
he gave a low whistle through his
thin lips

   well i never  and where did
 you get that 

   nellis did not answer he looked
 at the doctor distrustfully out of the
 corner of his eye

    i can guess the latter con-
 tinued and he began his work the
 dominie looked on concernedlv and
 seeing so much blood he asked  is
 it serious 

   the doctor shrugged his shoul-
 ders  enough to take you and me
 out of this world but these people
 have parchment instead of skin and
 cast-iron by way of bones he
 wiped his instruments carefully and
 said to nellis

    you can go back to the town
tomorrow you belong there dont
you on the heggelersdijk 

   the heggelersdijk was the dis-
nellis



 trict where the smugglers and the
 poachers lived

   no my friend you need not an-
swer my question is merely a
rhetorical figure go to the hospital
and the surgeon there will see to
you go before ten in the morning
he went away accompanied by
the old man nellis heard the click
of his nailed boots in the hall heard
him laugh as he stood in the door-
way and said

   only one of the townspeople
such as you dominie would be
fooled in this way any child in the
village could tell you

  then nellis understood that the
old man had taken him in without
knowing who he was and he looked
anxiously at the door as his protec-
tor entered the room fine folks
were always hand in glove with the
police and the courts

  the dominie said nothing he
paced the room once or twice and
then stood gazing out of the win-
dow his hands were crossed on his
back his fingers moved nervously
suddenly he turned and said in a
tone which implied that he had just
made a decision

   the first thing for you to do is
to eat and grow quite strong
nellis stared at him in astonish-
ment then the dominie went to
find the housekeeper who was busy
about the house her voice sounded
in the hall discontentedly  its a
shame dominie that good wine
which you got from your bible class
i cant allow it i shall go to the
village and get him some brandy
that is much better for him

  then followed some indistinct
reply from the old man and the
housekeeper responded

   well what difference does that
make i wont melt in the rain id
rather go to the village than to the
cellar as sure as im alive docs

the dominie think that i can stand
by and see him pour his good wine
down the throat of that tramp no
dominic dominie if youre going
yourself id much rather do it 

  and she pattered down the cellar
steps in her loose slippers

  she returned with a dish of stew
in one hand and a dusty bottle in
the other

   now dont drink that as if it
were water out of the gutter like
the stuff you get at home if i had
my way you wouldnt get any at all
but theres no arguing with the
dominie

  nellis seized the bottle and
gulped down the wine it was good
and then he fell on the food
bolting it ravenously until he was
satisfied and forgot his anxiety in
a new feeling of drowsy comfort
he lay back on his pillows and
looked around the room-at the
bedstead at a table on which stood
a large white bowl and a pitcher at
a cupboard full of books at a pic-
ture on the wall showing a pale race
crowned with a wreath of thorns
he vaguely remembered seeing
something like it before   

  his heavy eyelids drooped lower
and lower the last thing that he
noticed half asleep was the
dominie walking to and fro outside
in front of the window

  slowly the old man paced the
wintry garden up and down up and
down not heeding the cold drizzle
and the slipperiness of the muddy
black paths there was something
pathetic about his bent form in the
worn black coat now and then his
lips moved as if he were speaking
to himself he wore a worried ex-
pression for forty years the good
teacher had prcached to his congre-
gation of tradespeople some active
others sleepy and retired in the
secluded little dutch town where he
o

world fiction

had been born and bred he had
baptized their sens and daughters
catechized confirmed and married
them and everything had always
been as it should but suddenly this
smuggler had appeared it was like
a revelation from another world
from an evil wild chaos after the
first shock he was beginning to pon-
der the matter with the semi-fearful
curiosity of saintly souls regarding
evil wondering what might be the
inner being and existence of such a
man of violence

  he must lead this wanderer on
the path of perdition who had so
wonderfully been placed in his
power back to the fold but how
should he speak to him he visual-
ized nellis as he had seen him that
morning asleep-the youthful face
freckled to the very tip of the nose
the downy upper lip and the dark
lashes around the eyes which were
closed so quietly almost like those
of a child but then he thought of
the doctor

   a dangerous fellow i wouldnt
bother about him dominie its
casting pearls before swine

  he hesitated but in the end-it
was growing dusk-he reproached
himself for his little faith

   who hath made mans mouth
have not i the lord now there-
fore go and i will teach thee what
thou shalt say

  he went to his guest nellis lay
tossing under the tumbled blanket
his face dull red with the rising
fever he was thinking regretfully
of the loss at the last moment of his
hardwon gain the heavy sack
would certainly have brought in a
rijksdaalder now he would get
nothing and he had lost his boots
as well they were new   

  the dominie read the grief in his
dark eyes  already he repents
was his glad reflection he sat down

 beside the couch and placed his
 hand on nellis shoulder

    young man-

   the door was opened and the
maid poked her bonneted head
 round the corner

     dominie the burgomaster is
 here and wants to speak to you
 shouldnt wonder if it was about
 him there she added with a
 threatening look at nellis

   the dominie rose confusedly his
 benevolent thoughts were scattered
 like a brood of chicks at the swoop
 of a hawk

   what are we to do youre
 still very ill  he was quite upset
 wtas his home so hospitably opened
 to the fugitive to turn into a trap

   nellis jumped up and ran to the
 window with trembling fingers the
 old man undid the fastenings and
 helped to raise the heavy sash in a
 twinkling nellis was outside on his
 bare feet and out of the little gar-
 den on to the high road the pro-
 tecting dark enveloped him

   he limped along lor some dis-
 tance keeping as close as possible
 to the alders by the ditch and so
 in time he caught up to a covered
 cart which was jogging along the
 driver held out the butt end of his
 whip and hauled him on board
 among the sacks and barrels so he
 was carried along nearby to his
 home on the heggelersdijk

   his mother had hung the kettle
 over the fire to boil water for coffee
 and was warming her hands on the
 lukewarm metal

    i thought theyd caught you
 she remarked with listless astonish-
 ment

     theyd better look out for their
 own skins answered nellis he sat
 down by the window shaking vio-
 lently and supported his burning
 head with two hands

    i spose youve eaten 
nellis



  he said  yes  without raising
his eyes and when night came and
his father stumbled in and banged
the door behind him with an oath
he crept into a corner and lay down
with his face to the wall on an old
potato sack and some straw

  he remained there all through
the following day sometimes groan-
ing aloud nobody paid any atten-
tion to him he remembered how
the dominie had given him the
blanket off his bed and the wine
from his bottle and food out of his
dish

  the second day dragged slowly
on about noon he rose and rum-
maged in the muddle in the dark
dirty corners till he found a piece
of twine with this he went out he
returned tired and pale with the
smell of gin in his clothes and crept
into his corner but at evening he
rose again and went out of the town
into the woods

  the forest is bordered by a strip
of scrub oak which retains its dull
brown foliage all through the win-
ter into this he vanished bending
so that the branches swayed above
him as he went deep into the brush
when he emerged he held a brace
of hares by the hindlegs their
heads hung as if their necks were
broken and the eyes bulged from
their sockets he felt them they
were large and fat the dealer in
the town had not had such fine ones
for a long time he slipped the
hares into a bag and turned across
the fields in the direction of the
dominie house

  the cross old maidservant
opened the door

   so at least youve got the
decency to come and thank the
dominie hes been thinking you
were sick and dead for he went to
the hospital-in all this bad weather
and him so old-and they didnt

know anything about you there
she brought him to her master
the old man was sitting by the win-
dow pensively gazing at the west-
ern sky which stretched in pale hues
over the lingering orange on the
horizon like an archway of pearl
over a road of gold and translucent
glass he held an open book on his
knees

   here he is said the maid
laconically

  the dominie rose hastily from
his seat dropping the book to the
ground and running up to nellis
he laid his two small white hands
on the fist which still awkwardly
clasped the gnarled stick

   i am glad i am glad 

  he looked up at the sturdy face
above him his eyes glistening with
eager joy

at last nellis managed to open
his mouth and say  i thank ye very
kindly an heres a couple o hares
the dominie only half heard him
and did not understand him at all

   better not bring in the lights
yet he whispered to the maid  he
doubtless wants to speak to me
he laid his hand on the arm of his
guest and added  sit down nellis
-thats your name isnt it 

   yes they call me that an-
swered nellis in a doubtful tone
he sat down cautiously on the edge
of the chair

   and are you quite better 
the dominie asked

   pretty fair said nellis and
after a moment he added w-ith in-
creasing confidence  jan brunnings
gave me a lift tother day and they
didnt know nothing about me at
home and i aint heard nothing
neither not from the burgomaster
or the officers or the courts or
nobody

  the dominie interrupted him
nervously


world fiction

   ive been thinking how you
might best be helped i cant do it
myself i need no one-i do my
own garden but they want a gard-
eners assistant at the castle if i
give you a note to the lady she will
be sure to take you on

  nellis was busy loosening with his
teeth the strong knot which tied the
sack he gave it a final tug

  oh i can earn 

a plenty he de-
clared confidently

he pulled out the
hares and laid
them on the table

theyre fat
ones

 the dominic
leaned over to ex-
amine them with
h i s shortsighted
old eyes

  what have you
there 

   hares from the heath

i caughtm with a snare in the
woods

  he laughed half slyly half
boyishly  the gamekeeper
tracked all around me but he
aint seen me yet

   y o u dont mean to 
say that you poached those
hares  cried the dominie

  sure just now im a
good hand at that the barons
brother comes here to hunt every
year but he neednt take such pains
i ll see to that declared nellis
proudly

  the dominie was speechless
then he burst out

   fellow how dare you come to
me with these 

  he trembled so that he had to
steady himself on the tabic nellis
looked at him puzzled

   but i told you the keeper didnt
see me he said in self defense

 you neednt be afraid of him-he
wont bother you

  	he dominie sank back on his
seat covering his eyes with his
hands

   i saved him from punishment
and now he regards me as an accom-
plice was his appalling thought
and immediately the christian habit
of severe introspection forced him
-- to the humble ad-
mission  i de-
serve this-i was
silent when i
should have
spoken i left him
in his sins and
now he has fallen
deeper

he wiped the
perspiration from

his brow
while

and

said

you
is a

they belong

after a
gently

 dont
know that it
sin to steal 
nellis stared at
him in amazement
the old man
pointed with a
trembling finger at
the hares  take
those away and
deliver them to the
person to whom
unfortunate young
be a

man how have you come to
deceiver and a thief

    i aint ever stolen nothin yet
ried nellis  the man as told
you that lied 

  the dominie stared at him
what about those hares then 
he asked at last

 i snaredm mesel did the
dominie think that i d steal a hare
from a pal i went there mesel
this noon an set the snare and this
they were caught if i

evenin
nellis



takem to the town i can certainly
get twenty-five stivers for m across
the counter and nobody can say
nothin agin that

   nellis said the dominie as he
leaned forward and looked right
into his eyes  dont you really
understand that if you take those
hares which belong to another and
which he alone has the right to
shoot you are stealing and that
if you secretly carry salt across trie
border you are depriving the state
of customs and that that also is
theft

    i dont steal declared nellis
 everybody knows i carry salt 
can earn the money just as well as
the king hes got plenty any way

  	do not fool yourself with such
arguments you know that you
are doing something which is not
right if your conscience had been
clear you would not have run away
from the burgomaster-who did
not even know what you had done

    but of course ill run cried the
smuggler  should i let myself be
caught and hauled into court and
locked up  

   then you admit that you de-
serve punishment  asked the
dominie in a more severe tone

   yes if they catch you youve
got to go to the lock-up acknowl-
edged nellis an if theyre just
about it i wouldnt say nothin of it
but it happens sometimes that they
collar you when youre goin along
the edge of the woods and there
may be snares there but i mean to
say they cant prove that you putm
there but sometimes they take
you all the same and the game-
keeper is believed whether he
speaks true or not thats the law
and with smuggling its just the
same if they catch me with a sack
on my back and theyve seen me and
can swear to it that it was me well

 wouldnt say so much about it so
long as its fair but otherwise ill
punchm in the face and the officers
know that and theyre just as afraid
of the smugglers as die smugglers
are of them 

  he stopped he had clearly out-
lined the rights of both belligerent
parties

  the dominie looked at him sadly
and thought  is it possible that in
our land where the word of god
is taught to all there should be those
who are worse than the heathen 

  and he told the sinner of the
judges wrath of his compassion on
those who repent and turn from
their wicked ways of the peace of
those who walk in the path of right-
eousness nellis sat opposite him
his eyes fixed on the ground mo-
tioness he did not understand it
he did not understand why the rich
folks might shoot the hares on the
heath and he must not touch them
he did not understand why the king
who was rich should receive money
from him nellis who was poor
he did not understand why he
might not resist the police who
wished to take him into court he
the untamed lord of a wild gar-
den of eden upon whose head not
even the shadow of the tree of
knowledge had fallen understood
neither the law nor the law-giver
the old divine gave him his best all
his godliness all his pity all his in-
nocent grief-the most sacred treas-
ures of his own sweet soul and the
words in which is contained the
heritage of the sorrowing ages of
generations seeking and finding of
those few rare souls whose ardent
desire for the supreme good became
a purification and a light into the
world

   promise me that you will lead
a better life from now on he
pleaded


world fiction

  but nellis did not answer
he did not know what to say
he was unhappy and perplexed
finally he stood up took the
hares mechanically and went away
the dominie did not hinder him
in him arose bitterness against
this man who despised gods
grace and persevered in evil

  the aged maid crossed the hall
with the lamp as nellis went out
she saw his downcast face and the
hares in his hand

  stolen game shame on you
so you thought youd get rid of that
here impudent fellow thats all
the thanks we get  and she
slammed the door after him

  nellis stood outside in the dark
and the mist half stunned and he
returned whence he had come limp-
ing on his swollen foot he came
to the tavern where the smugglers
were wont to barter their salt secret-
ly to the shopkeepers of the town
a reddish light shone through the
dirty window he halted and
looked again at his hares  and
theyre such fine ones  in his dis-
appointment he said the words
aloud he could not think clearly
he only felt like some dull pain

within that the only one who had
ever been good to him had spurned
his gratitude and his gift

  some one opened the door of the
tavern cautiously the host peeped
out

   i thought somebody was bring-
ing in some salt he said in hushed
tones  whatcher got there
hares well thirty stivers for
the two

  nellis threw them at his feet

 takem and be d-d 

  in a moment the host had hidden
away the soft little bodies he in-
vited nellis to come in to take
a drink on the deal nellis took
the glass from pretty janie without
looking at her he swallowed the
raw gin and said gruffly

   gimme another you can
take it out of the daaldcr

  and he took a second drink and a
third and a fourth he drank till -
he no longer felt that dull pain with-
in and when the innkeeper
thought it was time to close for the
night he said

    yr creditsup nellis

  and led him to the door and
kicked him out into the street and
there he lay

old frida was not much to
brag about as a sea boat she
was all right in headseas for
she had a broad bow and a stern that
was round like a ball but if the
wind and the way she was headed
made the swell surge against her
sides the round-bowed lady was not
very safe to be out in there wras
not a pair of sea legs made that could
stand up on her then when she
rose and sank with the waves bury-
ing herself almost completely be-
tween them one could manage
neither on deck on bridge or in
stokehole

  as on this trip all the way from
blyth to a good distance past the
russian border with archangel as
her destination she had behaved
badly indeed as treacherously as a
snake or a fox it had been a voy-
age that had tested the crews
patience as never before and if
glowing oaths and red hot cursing
and damning could have melted an-
cient scrap iron there would have
been nothing left but slags of old
frida but lord you say one

  cant scrap a boat into junk just be-
  cause she rolls there is one thing
  certain however such a heaving and
  storm-ridden sea watch after watch
  day after day week in and week out
  unconsciously beats a feeling of de-
  pression into the blood and forces
  ones humor perilously beneath the
  zero point

   one dreary morning-off the
 russian coast-it happened that the
 steward had had bad luck with the
 bread baking the dough would
 not rise and the loaf looked more
 like half a pound of chewing gum
 than anything else in the world
 whether the rolling sea was to
 blame for this ill luck or if it was
 the stewards own fault i dont
 know but one thing is certain and
 that is that the same rolling sea did
 not tend to make the crew in the
 forecastle receive the soggy bread
 with any amount of satisfaction
 neither port nor starboard-
 neither seamen nor stokers a lesser
 thing than bad bread would have
 caused the crews unbalanced temper
 to overflow and the oaths and
 
fresh bread



curses that were flung at the
poor stewards head were indeed
both painful and choice

  it was especially the firemen and
the coal trimmers who were dissatis-
fied and it surely was not mothers
best behaved children who had
shipped on the frida on this trip
there were all kinds of refuse that
came from god knows where both
skipper engineer and mates had had
their hands full trying to keep
things going smoothly from watch to
watch it would have been folly to
take them to task for carrying a
browning in their hip pocket for
discontent had been smouldering un-
der the ashes for some time and it
was only the prudence and the in-
dulgence of the officers that pre-
vented it from coming to open fight

  but the feeling down in the stoke-
hole was increasing and on this
early dreary morning no power on
earth could have kept the cover from
flying off the kettle already the
youngest one of the coal trimmers
nils peisa had been sent astern
to the captain with a sample of the
stewards fatal bread and he had
been ordered by the rest to tell the
skipper in plain language that just
because they were stokers and sim-
ple seamen that did not mean that
they were swine and would eat all
kinds of garbage  they wanted bread
decent bread-fresh soft bread

  but the skipper was taking a nap
he was told and peisa returned with
a tray of crackers which were so
hard that they had to dip them in
their coffee before they could get
their teeth into them

  well-life on the sea is life on
the sea and if one cant get any soft
bread aboard ship there is always
hard tack to be found thats the
life of the sailor but the gang in
the fire room on the frida wasnt
that kind they hadnt come

aboard her to be starved to death

  jorgen knurrcn was their spokes-
man he always was-in peace as
well as in war if there was  devil-
try in the air as he himself called
it he was the one who by reason of
his size strength and brutal force
became their leader and if there
ever was a moment of peace and
quiet aboard the ship he would soon
begin with his complaints he would
grumble and growl and swear and
rage just to bring about fresh trou-
ble and deviltry one never could
feel safe with knurren around he
could not live without noise and
strife-he could not breathe in such
lukewarm air he had to use either
his mouth or his fists

   damn it he bellowed sudden-
ly and threw the piece of hard tack
he had in his hand against the deck
so that it was crushed into crumbs
and jumping to his feet he hissed
out what does that fop that
damned puppy-dog of a skipper
think that he can put over on us
well he can give you guys anything
he likes but me-me-jorgen knur-
ren  i am going to have a few
words with that sunday school guy
so help me god even if i have to
lay him out cold and see him dead
i jorgen knurren am going to get
decent soft bread i tell you

   oh dont get so excited knur-
ren said peisa trying to calm him
and going towards him in a conciliat-
ing manner  tomorrow everything
will be all right so whats the use
of  

  jorgen knurren stopped short and
stared at the coal trimmer for
a moment the youths audacity had
made him speechless and out of his
bloodshot eyes he gave him an evil
glance then suddenly he picked
up a piece of hard tack from out of
the bread basket on the table and
threw it at peisas head the youth


world ftction

  dropped to the deck with a gash in
his nose from which the blood flowed
freely

   puppy-dog cried the berserk
and he hissed out the word between
the teeth  dont you know
knurren 

  and wiping the froth from his
mouth with the back of his hand he
threw the white foam in the face of
the insolent one who had dared to
make suggestions to him

  but at this several of the men
were on their feet there was pro-
test in their faces which in the near-
darkness of the forecastle seemed
pale in comparison with knurrens
what the devil did he mean by strik-
ing one of them like that better
find out right now how hard he
could bite they put down their
cups and their eating utensils wiped
oft their mouths with the palm of the
hand hitched up their trousers and
stood angry and unflinching face to
face with knurren

  again jorgen stood agape for a
moment staring at his new adver-
saries then he snapped his jaws
together with a snarl and a gnash
swept the crowd with a glance of his
two flashing eyes and in the next in-
stant he had sprung to the doorway
where he stood facing them he
measured them with his evil yellow
eye like that of a cat piercing each
one as if he were branding him with
an iron then he slowly lifted his
enormous ham fist in the air bring-
ing it down with the weight of a
sledgehammer snarling under his
breath in a voice full of sneer and
menace the first mothers pet
that moves as much as a finger will
land w here he landed -and he spit
in the direction of the stunned coal-
trimmer  and mind you you fools
if any one of you dares to act as
cushion for my fist hell regret that
he ever was born have i said

enough he suddenly shrieked and
let his sledgehammer fist whiz in the
air round about himself with a
broad menacing sweep- sit down
or ill make you sit down  

  and the men stumbled defeated
and in silence to their seats at the
table

   now you follow me back to the
skipper you poor vipers and ill
show you you cowards how to get
bread thats fit to eat

  he stepped across the high thresh-
old out on the deck and stood there
waiting while one by one the men
came stealing out clinging close to
the bulk-head

   curs he exclaimed his mouth
distorted

  as he stood there knurren
looked what he almost was-a
mighty gorilla over six feet in
height a giant in every way almost
inexplicably ugly rugged and hairy v
the low apelike forehead slanted
back at a sharp angle the eyes were
like little round balls stinging and
black though they sometimes glist-
ened with a phosphorescent yellow
glow his jaw was square and prom-
inent and his clumsy unshapely
hairy hands hung below his knees
while the legs were slightly bowed
his whole frame was bent forward
and the upper part of the body was
pushed out in such a way that the
arms swung to and fro before him
like two clubs whenever he moved

   it wras difficult to find any trait in
this giants outward appearance that
might serve to prove that his origin
and ancestry could not be traced
back to the cream of society in some
east african animal kingdom this
monster must possess phenomenal
strength and he seemed to be al-
most dying for desire and a chance
to use it

  it cannot be said that people gave
much sympathy to jorgen knurren
fresh bread



as he dragged himself along in this
world the only reason for his be-
ing tolerated listened to and obeyed
by those with whom he happened to
come in contact was their respect
and fear for his physical power and
his brutality no one has any par-
ticular desire to be hammered to
pieces by a bloodthirsty gorilla

  the time was approaching eight
bells and change ot watch when jor-
gen knurren wabbled astern on his
straddling sea legs followed by the
gang from the stokehole ihe sea-
men heard the commotion and
thought they had best come along
too since it would otherwise seem
like a notion of only the few and
one by one and in small groups they
trailed aft one could hear knur-
ren mumbling and cursing in his red
beard as-heavy and awkward-he
walked toward the ships stern in the
rolling sea now and then he
would burst out into venomous pro-
fanity in the doorway of the mess-
room he met the steward he asked
him where the skipper was the
rest of the gang had stopped just
abaft of midship-as much out of
timidity as of old habit

   he is still asleep stammered
the steward and tried to hasten by

   then wake him you pasty
face he caught hold of him by the
neck and held him there as if he had
been a little child  and tell him
that knurren wants to talk to him

   you tell him that yourself jor-
gen whined the steward squeezed
into a corner in the gangway

  jorgen went inside and stopped in
the pantry his eye glanced from
door to door as if to calculate just
where the skipper was taking his
nap  suddenly he raised his head
angrily and shouted in a loud and
insolent voice

   here is some one who wants to
talk with you captain

  no reply no one appeared to
announce knurrens visit to his chief
neither mate nor second mate nor
any one of the engineers it seemed
almost as if they were staying away
purposely

  knurren paced toward the door
that was farthest aft of the port side
he shoved it open without even
knocking and it gave a bang that
you could hear throughout the com-
partment

  the captain drowsily turned
around in his bunk rubbing his eyes

   what sort of behavior do you
call this he grumbled  see that
you get back forward right away
 get back hissed knurren
 weve come here to get some
bread and we are not going to leave
until we get it are you awake
now

   youll get fresh bread when you
ask for it in a decent manner now
get out of here

  the skipper pulled off the blanket
the covered him and sat up at the
end of the bed two cold blue eyes
flamed against knurren  have
you understood what i said  it
came short and forceful

   i told you i want some fresh
bread or ill

  the skipper jumped down from
his bunk he was dressed in a white
flannel shirt which was open at the
neck and he had on his trousers and
a pair of slippers he was almost
a head shorter than knurren and of
slender build yet under the loose-
fitting shirt one sensed a pair of
broad well shaped shoulders and a
strong finely rounded chest

  the thin determined looking lips
of his mouth became a narrow strip
and a deep furrow appeared between
the thick and almost black eyebrows
as he pointed with his hand in the
direction of the doorway and re-
peated 


world fiction

   go

  the word hit knurren like a
whip he bent way over clenching
that enormous fist of his while his
eyes shot gleams of yellow

   i want to get  

  go there was a dangerous
note in the captains voice

  go and in the same instant
his fist made knurrens eyes look
into a rain of stars and more from
stupefaction than from fear or re-
spect the giant backed out through
the messroom across the gangway
and out on deck-followed by the
captain

   midships the crew stood all to-
gether in one large group the
sound of loud-mouthed talk an out-
cry and a dull thud had reached
diem out there and had stirred their
curiosity it had made them forget
ships discipline-never to come aft
of midship except in line of duty and
when they had work to do there
something must have happened just
now-they were staring and gaping
and could scarcely breathe for excite-
ment and when the two came out
they were all stretched across the
main deck like a fence of glaring
human beings

  jorgen knurren stumbled back-
wards his body bent although
the skipper was no longer pursuing
him but halfway to the crew he
stopped he straightened up threw
a quick wild glance across his shoul-
der wriggled his head like a bleed-
ing bull and started to spit furiously
as if he wanted to rid his mouth of
some unclean taste

  m damned whelp he yelled
shooting forward the upper part of
his body in the direction of the cap-
tain who had stopped too  cub
who only dares to hit a guy when
youve got him alone and no one
looking strike now f vou dare
you cheat - you bdly-pincher -

 strike me first you son of a 
 and ill squash you and grind you to
 bits

    you fool skipper-you come
 over here to me ha-ha you pale

	face-vou dont dare to do that i
 bet  

   but he suddenly stopped the cap-
 tain was calmly coming over toward
 him

    listen to me jorgen knurren
 he said in a quiet and even voice
 while his eyes met knurrens and
 held them nailed  no man has ever
 used such language to me on my own
 deck and got away with it so if
 what you want is fight youll get it
 nevertheless i am going to ask vou
 now once more-you and the rest-
 to go back to your deck youll get
 your fresh bread-as i have already
 told you-when you come and ask
 me in a decent way not when you
 come barking for it like dogs now
 go back to your quarters

    ho-hoi-i-i-i-i yelled knurren
 with a mocking laughter  so you
 want to fight you little toy-captain
    go who is it you tell to
 go a good-for-nothing like you
 dont you go guys you just stay
 here and i ii show you how to wipe
 the deck with the skipper s rags up
 here in the arctic ocean come on
 if you dare you milk fee pup come
 on  

   and the next moment the giant
 had pulled his heavy blue sweater
 over his head and fiung his cap on
 top of the winch then he pulled
 his belt a few notches tighter

   the little that one could see of
 the enormous body was brown as if
 it had been smeared with walnut oil
 b jt the chest and the arms and even
 the upper part of the shoulders
 were covered with thick black hair
 his muscles were tremendous and
 not until now as he stood there
 naked could one get the right im-
fresh bread



 pression of the abnormal length of
 his arms

    a murmur of admiration came
 from the crew intermingled perhaps
 with an undercurrent of anxiety for
 while most of them had not much
 use for their young captain-they
 could not forgive him the cold cor-
 rect tone in which he ordered them
 about and which made them boil
 with rage inside-the thought of see-
 ing him ground to pieces between
 jorgen knurrens sledgehammer
 fists alarmed them

    but when they saw the skipper
calmly taking ofi his shirt the anx-
iety they had felt disappeared in
most of them it no longer seemed
entirely certain that the fight was go-
ing to be nothing but a brutal butch-
er there was something about
the way the skipper had pulled ofi
his shirt that indicated it was not the
first time he had been in a fight and
none of them had imagined that
the loose-fitting clothes they saw him
in ev-erv day could hide a chest that
measured very few inches less than
knurrens his skin was a pinkish
white like a womans but under it
one could see winding wiry muscles
giving the skin that covered them a
bluish hue and at every movement
he made they would quiver and
throb just as they do on a blooded
horse

knurrens eyes took swift meas-
ure of his opponent he recoiled
but it was only momentarily
with a snorting sound he scornfully
swept aside his amazement

     the captain ordered the first mate
  and the boatswain to come over to
  him

 shall have to give jorgen
knurren the lesson he has been beg-
png for all this time he said his
i lips contracting into a slight smile

 but i dont know what sort of tac-
i tics knurren uses when he fights

and i want fair play so you two

will have to see that everything goes
right and you have to take the time
for each round too fairly and
squarely it may be a knockout that

will decide it

  seldom if ever have two so to-
tally di tie rent opponents been seen in
a ring almost inhuman raw
strength on the one side endurance
litheness and intelligence on the
other it was easy to see that knur-
ren did not like this arrangement of
time fair play and referee but he
made no opposition now he had
his chance in spite of all and he
would not fail to take advantage of
it no one of the men looking on
could have any doubt as to the final
outcome of the struggle but at the
same time they felt sure and had al-
ready had proof that it would be a
violent and a fierce battle

  at the very same instant that the
first mate cried  time  the
fight broke loose swift and lithe
as a boy in his teens the skipper
commenced to dance around the
colossus it was evident that the
noble art of boxing was by no means
greek to him he seemed to
realize that a pair of quick feet is
the best support to a mans fist his
movements were like laming he
drove home blows from left and
right now striking at him with a
feint now with a solid touch as if
he were just feeling his way

  knurren took to the defensive
he kept swinging around with his
right leg as a pivot following as best
he could the other mans movements
and partying his attacks with his
long arms his eyes fixedly watching
the skippers constantly moving
head but suddenly he grew weary
of this dancing around made a false
attack with his left and followed it
up unexpectedly with a mow of such
crushing force that the captain


world fiction

would have been sent into an in-
voluntary and lasting slumber if
he had not ducked his head as
promptly as he did and the sledge
hammer whizzed perilously near his
jaw

  the shaggy berserk now tried to
get close to him but the skipper
realizing only too well that once in
the gorillas grip he would be done
for fell back ducked and escapcd
and finally he sent home a tremen-
dous blow with his right that hit
knurren in the diaphragm it forced
the giant to stop and get his breath
he rolled his monkey head con-
fusedly it was the first time in his
life he had experienced such an
awakening he stood quite still for
a moment blinking his eyes and gaz-
ing at his opponent as if he were
about to ask how did you do
it

  but he was far from done for he
remembered his successful begin-
ning-made a feint with his left and
let the right follow with a tremen-
dous swing of the arm and the
skipper received such a blow on the
left of his neck that he began to
reel and the next second he felt him-
self caught in the horrible vise of the
ferocious gorilla then followed a
rain of short swift merciless blows
which sent the skipper half uncon-
scious down on the deck while the
colossus stood bending over him
prepared to give him a last knock-
out blow in case he should try to
raise his head with his watch in
his hand the first mate was just
about to throw himself between
them should knurren show signs of
taking advantage of the favorable
situation and try to throttle his
fallen enemy

   time   he was saved only by
seconds knurren had to be pulled
away by many pairs of arms he was
like a maniac swearing and yelling

 wildly and he could not understand
 what the devil time had to do with
 him

   the skipper was in need of the
 pause knurrens embrace and the
 jab to the neck had nearly put him
 to sleep and again and again he
 repeated to himself in his dazed
 condition that from now on it was
 a question of keeping away from
 those damnable tentacles another
 such squeeze and he knew that he
 would be done for and he nodded
 assent when the first mate whispered
 to him  try to close his blinkers
 -lie dont like the jab you gave him
 over the right eye

   so when it came to the second
 round the skipper kept his promise
 he tripped and danced driving
 home a punch with lightning speed
 jumped back and was again out of
 reach he tired out the slow awk-
 ward gorilla with his constant ring v
 dance and at the end of the round
 he planted two punches on his nose
 while they drew the blood from his
 mouth his skin which was like bark
 was only scratched yet the blood
 irritated the giant but the skipper
 felt all the time as though he were
 hitting a sand bag when the round
 was finished he nevertheless was at
 an advantage in spite of his fall in
 the previous round knurren was
 puffing violently he acted as if he
 were doing it in order to fill his lungs
 quite full it was a new sensation
 and knurren hated anything that
 was foreign and incomprehensible to
 him he glanced in the direction of
 the crew to see whether they had
 noticed anything he saw them
 with their heads close together and
 he delivered under his breath a
 string of vicious oaths  you just
 wait you swine 

   in a rage knurren took to the
 offensive he stabbed and stamped
 like a bull but the captain seemed
                fresh bread



as if made of rubber for he was
never there when knurren struck
several times the berserk received
punches in the solar plexus blows
that made him cry out and gasp tor
breath exhausted and seeing red
he tore at this marionette enemy of
his in order to put an end to this
ridiculous exhibition but again he
ran his eye into a tremendous right
hook  which made him sneak off
with a sheepish expression on his
cruel countenance at the same
moment the first mate called out
that time was up

  he puffed and snorted and seemed
silly in his rage he knocked the
pitcher of water that they handed
to him out of sight growling that
he was no sucking baby that needed
to be nursed or looked after he
knew that with a single blow of one
of his two mighty knock-out fists he
had put to sleep dozens of men
but this damnable captain he seemed
unable to manage somehow and
what was worse-he was forever
coming with these new and unex-
pected punches that made his eyes
see less each time shutting them up
and making them smaller with each
blow   

  during the next three rounds the
captain led completely and again
knurren felt as if he couldnt
get air enough into his lungs

his arms had become heavy
as lead and he had to gather
all his strength to be
able to raise them was 
this what thev
call being tired 



there was something akin to won-
der behind his monkey brow

  toward the end of the eighth
round the skippers growing sell-
assurance nearly sent him to his de-
struction in a moment of careless-
ness he permitted the giant to come
too close to him and managed only
partly to parry an upper-cut which
sent him high in the air his feet
entirely clear of the deck before
he had time to pick himself up again
the giants right fist described a
circle in the air and hit him from the
side nearly separating his ear trom
his head again he was saved by
the calling of time

in spite of the violent
flow ot blood pour-
ing in streams from
the wound and
the stinging pain
of it the captain
was at his adver-
sary again ready


world fiction

to give and to take still more beat-
ing both men however were now
more careful although many and
heavy blows were dealt the skip-
pers white body began to take on
patterns in red and flaming tints
but he had learned his lesson and
kept at due distance from the iron
paws of the savage

   the thirteenth round was almost
the captains last in a moment
when he thought he saw his
adversary expose himself he
attacked with a short punch against
his chest and ribs but knurren
parried with a devastating blow
against his jaw and he toppled over
and fell to the deck he did not get
up and they all thought his neck was
broken it seemed as if his muscles
had ceased functioning the spec-
tators approached with feelings of
anxiety and curiosity but no-he
was not beaten yet before the mate
had counted to five the captain was
on his elbow on seven he was crawl-
ing to his hands and knees and be-
fore nine had passed the mates lips
he wtas in the face of his startled
antagonist with two iron-hand eye-
shutters but the berserk had
scented victory and was on the alert
he hailed a veritable storm of jabs
and blows upon the skippers still
befogged head the captain reeled
first to the right then to the left
and when time was called he fell
against the deck like a lifeless corpse

  they carried him to the ships
railing and the boatswtain threw
water on his face while the first mate
tried to get him to stand on his feet
it looked serious his eyes seemed
unable to open and foam dripped
from a lifeless mouth but when
the stewrard arrived w ith a glass of
cognac he roused to life again
the mate who was holding him in
his arms felt the strength beginning
to return to the beaten body and he

was encouraged to think that his
chiet might last a lew rounds more

   i	he captain however knew that
it was not a question of rounds he
felt that his strength was at its
lowest ebb and he realized that it
was no use attempting to regain his
lost power by any scientific tricks or
to preserve what he had left by care-
ful attacks

  the next round would be the de-
ciding one  here wras not the
slightest doubt in his mind as to
that he himself was almost at the
end of his resistance nevertheless
not so near as knurren-who had
been gloating at his fallen enemy
with badly disguised triumph all this
time-thought that he was

   there were no feints or jabs this
time knurren raged forward in a
fierce manner apparently deter-
mined to make this the last chapter
he pushed the captain before him
over toward the winch wrhich was
midship but with unbelievable
quickness and endurance the skipper
succeeded in parrying and ducking
and keeping away from the close
proximity of the excited and mad-
dened gorilla knurren retired and
in his arrogance he exposed himself
again and again in order to entice
the skipper to follow him out on the
deck where he could get at him and
give him the final blow

  but the captain wouldnt follow
him he refused to be taken un-
awares and then exhausted knur-
ren with a long drawn-out oath went
after him again

  then the miracle happened

   like lightning the captains right
fist shot its way into the giants solar
plexus which he had left uncovered
it looked as if in this blow he had
collected all the weight and force he
still possessed no one can say
exactly how it occurred but sud-
denly knurren threw his arms in the
fresh bread



air and fell flat on the deck like one
who had been shot

  the captain stood stiff staring at
his fallen enemy while he was being
counted out then he sank in a
heap without a sound at jorgen
knurrcns side pale and motionless
it took some time to put life into
knurren and his victorious captain
and quecrly enough both of them
opened their eyes at the same time

  the captain was the first to
get on his legs with his hands in his
pockets he stood and watched the
men trying to help knurren to his
feet again rubbing and massaging
his legs in order to make them sup-
port the body there was neither
resentment nor triumph in his eyes
as he stood there regarding the
colossus before him he just
seemed to be waiting to see what
the other man was going to do

  then knurren caught sight of

him strength suddenly returned to
the giants body with a rough ges-
ture he brushed aside those who
were trying to help him quickly
stroked the back of his hand across
his eyes which were almost glued
together and went forward to the
captain he stretched out his
broad hairy fist and his voice was
not very clear as he said

   captain you are the first man
who has ever made jorgen knurren
bite the dust and if i never
got anything but hard-tack to eat
for the rest of my life id gladly
chew it on any ship on which you
are the skipper

  the captain took his hand and a
shadow of a smile passed across his
thin lips as he shook it and replied
 to-morrow morning youll get
some fresh bread jorgen knurren
for now you have asked for it in a
decent way

chapter ii

oh times oh customs oh
progress oh democracy oh
disappointing vulgarity an-
archists of our earlier years poor
devils with eyes lost in dreams noble
brutes in straw sandals and blue
woolen sweaters i

  you slaughtered innocent em-
presses stabbed harmless presidents
and died loathed by the crowd in
the pale dawn when the blade of
the guillotine seemed to gleam like
a belated new moon

  you were ignorant of the subtle
limit which separates crime from
political action you believed that
by striking down a person you could
destroy a society

  your error was great you old
romantics but let the present con-
sole you your nephews have
profited by your blunders you
were only alarming they to-day
are redoubtable and their anarchy
appalls me because it breeds
tyrants

  that evening stapfer jean-

pierre-hippolyte postman in the
cornavin district finding only three
letters in his bag praised the lord
they were addressed in the order
of their distribution as follows

  monsieur v  medviedof  rue
rossi

  monsieur le consul de france the
consulate

  monsieur le secretaire-adjoint du
consul same address

  the letter paper of all three
missives was the same the hand-
writing was the same the perfume
was the same but postman stapfer
didnt notice these details he
limited himself to determining that
the postage on the three was
sufficient

  then his heart lightened by the
completion of his days work
stapfer utilized his liberty by setting
out for a communist reunion

  the meeting was to be held be-
hind closed doors at ten oclock in
the back room of pere ouritzkys
shop it was not the first time that
the intelligenzia sat in session at
the moles



the old mans but this evenings
reunion was invested with a special
importance by the fact that medvie-
doff had promised to lay before it
the plans of a vast movement from
which would sprout  like the buds
of spring the first flowerings of
the great revolutionary tree those
were his own words for this cold
and self-controlled man dropped
easily into rhetoric when in his talk
he evoked the revolution

   like the buds of spring
stapfer repeated in his turn and
pounded his heels more gently on
the asphalt of the place neuve
proud that he was to come in contact
presently with some of those men
whom a zuricher had praised to him
during the two months of his last
relief service on the frontier-
porodziansko muravieff goro-
chebnikoff and the supreme master
of all of them medviedoff

  names fitted by their harmony to
charm stapfers innocent soull
then other names mysterious son-
orous as the forests yet lighter and
cheerier than the first-villebot
dably legre all from france
which the erudite stapfer had al-
ready seen in the windows of book-
stores on the covers of magazines
at the bottom of tracts discreetly
distributed in the cantonment
stables mascarvigni broncasso
whose  uawenire  and a la
gazetta del lavoratore  the young
fellows of tessin read out of
sight of their chiefs finally from
nearer home the pastor kurt de
loueche ziegelmann of chaux-de-
fonds drcher of zurich and the
corman comrades

  indeed these would not be all
medviedoff had several times an-
nounced that geneva would remain
a sub-committee without ever spec-
ifying what was the central body
a conscientious employee and

methodical person stapler relished
the secrecy of the workers inter-
national less than he did its rigid
organization it was like the postal
administration-only more exact
more thoroughly hierarchized it
gave stapfer a title-that of  vigi-
lant for propaganda -and though
inferior and almost negligible com-
ihg after the more enviable func-
tions of  propagandist  zealot 
and  effective agent stapfer
valued this title which lifted him
above the anonymous mass of
comrades granted him beside his
syndical card a ticket to all council
meetings embroidered on his sleeve
one of those symbolical stripes
which capitalist society had always
refused him

   like the buds of spring  that
pleasant figure of speech brought
him back as he walked along to the
necessities of his task the day when
the internationale should send a
call to its children-to run to the
carnavin morse office seize the
apparatus defend it pending the
arrival of communist reinforce-
ments or fight to the last breath and
die for the red flag it was a
solemn oath taken at prazemkines
before the picture of karl marx
how different that was from mili-
tarist servitude an oath on the bible
or an oath to the flag the  vigi-
lant  felt on his brow the burning
breath of heroism in the evening
air under the branches of the
bastions ignoring the amorous
couples on the benches the little
postman believed now that he saw
travelling ahead of him the exag-
gerated shadow of a great man one
of those prodigious beings at whose
feet mobs bow stapfer defender
of the communist morse equipment
the vigilant-chief of the equali-
tarian republic


world fiction

  at the door ouritzky demanded
ten sous stapfer paid them but
criticized in sharp terms such anti-
communistic conduct

   you have to order drinks too
ouritzky added mildly then as
the postman flew into a rage talked
of taking the matter to the com-
mittee and exhibited his pass as
vigilant the old man shrugged hi
shoulders and handing back the
card now carrying like a fossil
mark the fat imprint of his thumb
murmured

   foolishness-ach all that is
foolishness

  his gesture of sovereign con-
tempt looking over the little post-
mans head seemed to embrace the
company the shop the morse tele-
graph the world and the thunder
of god

  although the meeting was called
for ten oclock stapfer entering at
nine found himself so jostled in the
crowd that he took a seat in the
corner alongside the oil jars where
he was left shut in breathless and
almost suffocated he was greatly
intimidated also by the presence of
unknown comrades among whom he
made out so many zealots propa-
gandists and effective agents-all
superior beings whom a simple
vigilant could address only with the
greatest respect

  a man approached him a gigantic
georgian promoted because of his
six feet of stature and his powerful
arms to the rank of commissary

   your card   he demanded

  stapfer had to show again his
beautiful red card which the giant
read with a contemptuous air
then he drew back and seemed to
measure stapfer with a look

  schweizaretz -merzavetzl
swiss pig he said in an aside to a
famished looking boy who wore the
white cloak of the tolstoyan absti-

nents but before leaving he
thought it worth while to make a
further impression on this puny
stranger lor he introduced him-
self roaring in a terrible voice

  do you know who i am
comrade i am muravieff the
communist from the caucasus

  rachel the shutters cried
ouritzkys shrill voice above the
buzz of conversation

  after the beautiful jewess had
drawn together the heavy wooden
panels the heat in the narrow room
became intolerable

   leave them open  somebody
called out but all the others pro-
tested in chorus an excellent way
to give the alarm to the police
whom spies had probably already
warned of the meeting these last
words were spoken in french with
certain indirect glances which made
the unfortunate stapfer still more s
uncomfortable

   the first man to open them is a
traitor shouted ouritzky

  and as quiet ensued he took ad-
vantage of it to cast a triumphant
glance at his daughter the great
heat too would create thirst and
thirst called for lemonade a
famous vitriol which he served only
on these occasions after having
carefully removed the label  sous
a litre

  then when all his guests had
harangued vociferated and sung the
famous  da boudiet revoliou-

iat pere ouritzky stood up very
sleepily brandished one of the
bottles and answered in his sing-song
voice 

   da da boudiet bravo my
children i make it only twenty
sous a bottle 

  foolishness i ach foolishness

  now with the shutters closed and
the door locked so that no light

    lono lice the rciolvtion
the moles



could escape to the outside the
grocery seemed to sleep snugly in
the country-like cuiet of the street
nothing distinguished it from the
other shops scattered along the
dreary avenue connecting plain-
palais and carouge except perhaps
the three hebrew characters on the
sign and the addition in russian let-
ters sditzj govoriat po-rotissky
but one saw these letters and signs
so often repeated on the windows of
butchers tailors booksellers and
cigarette dealers in this ghetto of
the invaders that the good citizens
of geneva had long since ceased to
take any notice of them poor
over-hospitable switzerland which
for love of liberty received exiles
only to send them back dictators i
 hasnt vladimir ilitch come 
said a voice

  a certain impatience had begun
to manifest itself ten oclock
struck and not one of the directing
members of the sub-committee had
appeared those who filled the
grocery now were as ouritzky
would have said only the small fry
of these meetings-men wearing
threadbare patched and repatched
capes or cloaks with greasy collars
women pale and thin in masculine
waterproofs with tam-o-shanters or
caps on their heads preserving of
their past charms only the restless
flame in their eyes

   isnt vladimir here 

  presently the cries redoubled
vladimir tlitch i vladimir ilitch 
afanassi nikiphorovitch why isnt
vladimir ilitch here

  porodziansko isnt here either i
  nor mascarvigni nor villebotl
  a woman squawked

  you know well enough that
mascarvigni is in france

    es but the others 

   it is ridiculous to make us

    rvilan ipokcn firrg

wait here so long for nothing

   we are wasting our time 

   we have been waiting for an
hour

   well what if you wait another
hour didnt plekhanoff and axel-
rod wait twenty-live years to see the
first revolutionary workman m

  everybody was silent he who
had checked the clamors of the
meeting with this tone of authority
was a tall white-haired old man
very erect in his linen robe tied
about the waist with a cord-a type
of solid mujik with soft and deep
blue eyes under bushy eyebrows

  stapfer recognized him prazem-
kine the virtuous prazemkine who
had received his oath of fidelity
under the picture of karl marx

  a beautiful figure moreover-
this earliest of the emigres endur-
ing for twenty years in the slums
of geneva a nobly supported
poverty up to a ripe ge he had
taught natural sciences in a uni-
versity in southern russia so
ignorant of the new social theories
that he knew only by hearsay of the
works of marx and engels a
chance reading unveiled the mani-
festo to him it was a revelation
the lightning flash of conversion
illuminating the awakened soul of
a mystic the impure hands which
had opened the manifesto let it
drop only to unite in a gesture of
prayer and then separate in horror
trembling repenting their crime re-
volted at having been soiled for so
many years by impure contact with
money neglecting the accomplish-
ment of the only noble task indi-
vidual labor for the benefit of the
community

   yes twentv-fivc years before
seeing the first revolutionary
worker prazemkine repeated he
knew that a single word from him
would suffice to restore silence and
ioo

world fiction

he could not forbid himself a cer-
tain pride a survival of bourgeois
weakness perhaps in seeing the
most ardent cool down

  they revered him in fact like a
patriarch they attributed to him -
a culture which medviedoff himself
envied nevertheless if prazem-
kine had been questioned he would
have admitted in all frankness that
his inexhaustible knowledge was
limited to his study of the mani-
festo alone in the narrow attic
room where he lived and where he
preserved of his former splendors
only the masters books and an
english lithograph of marx pub-
lished in london in  in the
red republican he spent long
hours every day with the mani-
festo opened on his knees arguing
such and such an article meditating
on it in company with several
disciples pointing to the lines with a
shrivelled finger as an exegete ex-
pounds the bible

  a tiny stove stuffed to the burst-
ing point transformed the attic
room into a hot box where happy
cats took their ease flowers were
drying up in a vase on the window
sill near the exiles rickety chair
one would have said it was the
modest retreat of some mimi pinson
in retirement the cosy shelter of an
old maid still romantic though
thin-blooded cultivating the illusion
of country surroundings before her
pot of basil

  if vladimir hitch isnt here he
has good reasons for making us
wait

  prazemkine emboldened by his
first success went on in a grave
voice a little formal and pedantic
but no one listened to him any
longer the protests started up
again an atmosphere of storm
hung over the smoke-filled room

  what a queer idea it was of

ouritzky to keep closed up to meet-
ing time the larger room in the back
ot the shop 

  open the door  open the
door  they cried

  but all at once a howling was
heard above the other clamor

   son of a dog will you open-
yes or no  

   here advanced pushing through
the crowd a sort of hairy being a
bandy-legged dwarf with the muzzle
of a beast with misshapen arms
long and gnarled like a trees
branches the old man panic-
stricken obeyed

   its gorochebnikoff a neigh-
bor explained to stapfer who was
overlooking no detail of this first
meeting-a little nervous all the
same feeling that he had been led
into strange company

   gorochebnikoff  the man of
whose merits prazemkine had
boasted on the day of the oath-tak-
ing  gorochebnikoff by occupa-
tion a scrubman now that the
bourgeois regime obliged him to
earn a living but in whom the future
revolution saw the organizer a
sort of superior samson ready in
advance to discharge all the duties
of a communist clean-up at
present a nerve-shaken maniac a
sanguinary epileptic living in per-
petual apprehension of the ap-
proaching crisis proud in fact of
his deformity which he attributed
to the vices of his mother another
victim of the abhorred bourgeoisie

  the crowd having passed into the
back room there remained in the
front one only some peaceful
patrons little shopkeepers tired out
by their daily toil happy to find in
the rancid lemonade something of
the far-off savor of the national
kvass quietly discussing business in
utter scorn of the communist deca-
logue  two students who while wait-
the moles

ioi

ing for the meeting were holding an
examination quiz and a group of
women talking over a course in
literature

  through the half-open door came
the strident voice of gorochebnikotf
while prazemkine repeated inces-
santly 

   they waited twenty-five years
-axelrod and plekhanoff-twenty-
five years before seeing the first
revolutionary worker

  suddenly there was a silence one
of those silences wrhich occur in a
church when the prodigious breath
of divinity passes across the brows
of the worshippers

  through the low shop door came
medviedoff he cast a rapid glance
at ouritzky and shook oft his cape
with a slightly theatrical gesture
then bare-headed brushing back
with a familiar motion the thin hair
on his forehead he walked toward
the improvised platform in the rear
shop-broad planks laid on four
barrels supporting a table and three
chairs to which one mounted by two
herring boxes one large and one
small arranged like steps

  once in the presidential seat the
chair in the middle the secretary of
the sub-committee made a sign to
two persons who had entered at
the same time as he did but whom
the comrades had not noticed be-
cause of their hurry to get settled on
the auditorium benches they now
saw advancing from the other end
of the shop a young man with a
rosy face and exaggerated manners
clean-shaven like a scotch minister
as he took his seat on the chair to
the left he quietly drew off his
gloves showing in all his move-
ments the affected indolence of a
dandy

  hev whispered

   its villebot the delegate from

france the editor of nous tous
all of us

  presently that little communist
review circulated from hand to hand
-a publication as neat and elegant
as its proprietor the striking title
stood out in green letters on a pearl
gray cover in a frame of ara-
besques the subtitle read or-
gan of the world democracy

  villebot and his magazine had
only a brief success for all eyes were
turned to the second personage
seated on the speakers platform at
medviedoffs right they dis-
tinguished at first little but a long
black cape a sort of scarf also
black covered the strangers head
which to intensify the mystery was
enveloped in a muslin veil hiding
the features in short a true feuiu
leton figure of whom one couldnt
say yet whether it was a man or a
woman although the slight body
and the rounded shoulders per-
ceptible under the cape indicated
that it was a woman but wthy be
astonished at that it was not the
first time that medviedoff had thus
brought with him one of those enig-
matic beings with whom he loved to
surround himself calm reigned
again all eyes were fixed on the
table in the heavy air there was
only a silence cadenced by the
crowds breathing

  medviedoff began to speak his
voice low at first rose little by lit-
tle now firmer and more distinct
but broken by moments of harsh
strident intonation or by super-acute
sonorities like those of a nervous
woman

  he thanked the comrades wtho
had responded to the committees
summons and whose presence in the
hall whither the french proletariat
had sent one of its most illustrious
representatives the elegant ville-
bot bowed constituted a living


world fiction

symbol of the coming union of the
peoples and then evoked in advance
the kindly sense of the worlds com-
munist association he regretted
however that insurmountable diffi-
culties had prevented the secretaries
of the central committee from being
with them to-day his voice re-
covered its harsher inflection when
he mentioned the dear german com-
rades detained in their own country
-schumacher in bavaria franken
and helena hertling in berlin
then noticing stapfer medviedoff
changed his tone his expression
became soft almost wheedhng and
caressing he even made a spon-
taneous movement with his arms
toward the vigilant as if to embrace
and press him to his breast

  he spoke in turn in french ger-
man and russian so that each one
of the comrades of the great com-
munist fatherland could have his
share in the discourse often lean-
ing over toward the front bench
where strange auditors with semitic
faces were seated he talked through
his nose exaggerating his gestures
and turning his speech into their jar-
gon-that international yiddish
which from london to constanti-
nople rallies under the same lan-
guage high finance and the ghetto

  what a man  murmured
stapfer much affected and this
same thought was to be read on all
visages-an ardent admiration a
sort of passionate devotion-on the
moist lips of second-hand clothes
dealers with curls on the mens
brows wrinkled with attention in
the humid eyes of the women whose
throats swelled out from time to
time in stifled sighs his hands
clasped over his breast in the
prophetic manner prazemkine drank
in these preludes to the marxian
gospel rolled up in a comer on his
gnarled legs gorochebnikoff gri-

maced at his ease only villebot
drummed on the table with a distant
and indifferent air the phantom in
the long cape hadnt budged

    beer lemonade  whispered
 ouritzky two bottles in his hands

   approaching his subject med-
viedoff gave a rapid history of the
movement as a preface to the sensa-
tional revelations those famous
l buds of spring for which stapfer
was waiting his voice had fallen
to a dead timbre the nonchalant ut-
terance of a tired lecturer never-
theless in brief concise phrases as
if he were explaining pictures thrown
on a screen before the audience he
retraced step by step the progress
of the communist idea from the
embryonic marxian period to the
beginning of the world conflict he
trembled slightly as he recalled his
brothers death and ostentatiously
wiped his glasses villebot took
this opportunity to nod approvingly
applause came from a bench on the
right quickly repressed by the in-
dignant prazemkine as outraged as
a religious devotee would be to hear
such manifestations at the end of a
sermon

    sitting erect in his chair medvied-
 off studied the abortive revolution
 of  and again his voice became
 sharp and strident writh piercing
 notes or biting with sarcasms about
 the first meeting of the soviet

   then turning dialectical passing
 from the oratorical emphasis which
 he affected in his invective to the
 mathematical argumentation of de-
 bate 

    and now comrades t shall
prove to you that the revolution can
be only the indispensable culmina-
tion of capitalistic evolution which
carries in itself war to the ultimate
limit

   that was why he welcomed the
war-why for years he had wished
the moles



for war and this war now un-
loosed he wanted to see it made still
harsher and more cruel all the
tears and deaths up to now were not
enough he desired to see multi-
plied a hundred fold those horrors
at which his too humane heart stood
aghast it was necessary that the
earth should run with blood and
smoke like a fireplace full of peat
rheims louvain verdun and dix-
mude were only childs play in
the presence of the massacre of
which this too humane heart
dreamed his fist pounded on the
table a ferocious gleam came into
his eyes

  stapfer was startled

  although he understood but little
of this polemic he was conscious that
medviedoff was uttering big and
beautiful words and the breathless
silence of the comrades confirmed
him in that impression

  nevertheless he felt a certain dis-
quiet alarmed by the word  war
which here in neutral and peaceful
switzerland the vigilant ad-
horred in the cantonment on the
frontier when on calm nights he
heard distinctly the thunder of the
cannon in alsace his antimilitarist
faith was kindled fiercely ardently
ready to transform him if need be
into a heroic defender of the com-
munist telegraph communications
but that sacrifice accomplished he
wished to enjoy in serenity the de-
lights of universal peace-the per-
manent quietude of a world from
which the last rifle had been
banished

  an honest man at bottom stap-
fer had also a heart sensitive to
human sufferings and open to pity
he could not pass through the
peristyle of the rath museum
where twice a week he devoted an
hour of his spare time to unwrap-
ping packages without being pro-

foundly saddened by the posters on
the walls the  refugees from the
north by steinlen-the mute dis-
tress of a family a heart-broken old
man awkwardly carrying a child in
his arms-two lamentable sketches
by poulbot and the whole bitter
gamut of forain all pure master-
pieces which awakened in stapfers
soul the vague consciousness that
france after all was fighting for
something besides the interests of
her bankers

  he had turned instinctively to
communism because he expected of
it concord and union and yet in
his first words its aposde was cele-
brating war wishing it to be longer
and more savage acclaiming with
gestures of hatred the red cheer of
blood

  the crowd had received the mas-
ters declaration with a shiver of
enthusiasm the tolstoyan ab-
stinent and the communist from the
caucasus exchanged sympathetic
smiles stapfer thought that he
heard in the corner where this
quasimodo of a gorochebnikoff
grated his doglike chops against
each other an exclamation from a
woman whose arms were entwined
about the monsters shoulder

   what a czar he would make  

  during the intermission the
grocers voice was heard again
announcing his wares the jews on
the front bench stretched themselves
laughing and shaking their curls to
right and left

  medviedoff must have judged
that the moment had come to go to
the real point of the discussion-
a dangerous question demanding
of him who would resolve it more
science and suppleness than all the
doctrines of hate in which he hnd
taken delight up to now the
brutal facts wrere as follows the
german consul had turned over to


world fiction

him the nigfit before two hundred
and twenty thousand francs in a
check payable at the deutsch-
auslaendische bank of geneva for
the purpose of fomenting a strike
on such a date as the imperial gov-
ernment should fix in establish-
ments in the canton making war ma-
terial for the entente countries an
almost equal sum had been distrib-
uted among the sub-committees of
latin switzerland but geneva was
to give the signal the german
cantons would then declare a sym-
pathetic strike that at least was
the inner conviction of the imperial
legation at berne and kurt
dreher and ziegelmann sounded
by herr von hardberg had guaran-
teed success

  further according to the views
of berlin this movement ought to
coincide with the disturbances caused
at creusot by the presence of mas-
carvigni in short a pretty coup
double and triple germany wishing
to wind up the affair at verdun
before november

      take care of the syndicates
medviedoff said calmly to consul
von thrich as he slipped the check
into his portfolio  but i am afraid
of the committee

  and since von thrich expressed
surprise

   they are honest people your
excellency but behind the times and
impractical they will accuse me
of having dealings with the bour-
geoisie

  herr von thrich carelessly signed
another check his fountain pen
made a blot on it

   here said the consul as he
removed the spot with his blotting
pad  are five thousand marks
which his majesty deigns to send
through me to the committee for
let us not forget mv dear mcdvied-
off that the more men despise money

the more easily they are bought
by it

   in the cosy salon-of the consulate
under the severe glances of his ma-
jesty and the kaiserin augusta re-
action and marxism exchanged the
kiss of peace

  but now vladimir ilitch trembled
in the presence of the faithful be-
fore the too pure prazemkine goro-
chebnikoff muravieff these women
illumined by the true word those
men whom the very mention of
 capital  seemed to enrage as a
red rag does a bull his emotion
betrayed itself in a livid pallor a
nervous trembling of the fingers
his glance sought villebots which
seemed to give him the signal  go
ahead comrade then his eyes
rested for a moment on the black
motionless figure to his right so
attacking the question directly eager
to finish with it he blurted out

   porodziansko crossed the fron-
tier yesterday

  a murmur of astonishment ran
through the crowd a womens
quavering voice said

   you mean mascarvigni vladi-
mir ilitch

   no i said porodziansko

  as if to emphasize the significance
of the words he repeated

   porodziansko crossed the fron-
tier yesterday he is in france
again a murmur ran around the
benches prazemkine holding his
hand to his ear like a speaking
trumpet bent his head forward be-
lieving that he had not heard aright
the jews shuffled in their seats
showing their amazement by sweep-
ing gestures shouting these words
to one another u arovhf aroub
abgerekstt 

   mascarvigni demanded it ex-
claimed villebot seeking an excuse
to come to the orators aid but
his phrase did not have the quieting
the moles



effect which he anticipated to
allow a secretary to go on a mis-
sion without the consent of the coun-
cil was a grave infraction of the
statutes of the organization a sort
of bourgeois coup delat which
anarchist discipline could not toler-
ate however high the credit which
medviedoff enjoyed with his com-
rades this act of independence might
cost him his leadership

  no law no master except the
chiefs and the rules as prazemkine
declared moreover this first ob-
jection to the masters exercise of
his good pleasure was supplemented
by another and graver one which
had to do with finances all these
honest men might condemn the in-
iquity of capital to the point of put-
ting it into a common treasury
but they didnt intend that anyone
should dispose of it without their
express consent now porodzian-
skos trip to france meant a draft
by anticipation on the said reserve
and the accounts were not in a suf-
ficiently satisfactory state to permit
useless expenditures discontent
succeeded the evangelical ecstasy of
a few moments before

   let the comrade have a chance
to explain said delegate villebot

  thats it let him explain
let him explain 

   comrades medviedoff began
 the interests of the cause made
comrade porodzianskos trip indis-
pensable

   how so what made it indis-
pensable 

  the discontent increased med-
viedoff also becoming impatient
shouted

   yes indispensable mascar-
vicmi couldnt do the job alone the
occasion was favorable for the
last week the french consulate has
been upset by preparations for a fete
a gala day of the allies at any

other time we should have had to
wait months to obtain a passport

  certainly that much was evident
but since the tumult was not ap-
peased medviedoff burst out

   how plainly must i put it to
you do you think perhaps that
the workers will go on strike if we
sit here with our arms folded 

  then he explained his projects
a general strike at creusot was only
a matter of hours although jeal-
ously concealed by the french cen-
sorship it was already announced
in the german press on whose au-
thority some swiss evening news-
papers had also spoken of it now
if it lasted only a week if it lasted
only a day its consequences would
be incalculable to france at a mo-
ment when germany was preparing
to launch the crown princes best
troops in an assault on verdun
the swiss proletariat by uniting
with the french strikers would con-
tribute to the swift collapse of one
of the belligerents and in the pres-
ent state ot the war collapse could
only be a prelude to revolution
hey were bringing about in france
the disorganization from which the
russian empire suffered after
kovno brest-litovsk and warsaw

   we have moreover the very
best news villebot interrupted in
a tranquil voice  there were
three important mutinies last week
at chalons at epinal and at the base
at sathonay

   you hear cried medviedoff
triumphantly

  then fumbling nervously in his
letter-bag he drew out a crumpled
copy of a newspaper

   here shall i read this  the
dead body of colonel krause has
been discovered in marseilles at the
russian expeditionary base the
polkovnik krause he repeated
and his voice was drowned in the
to

world fiction

joyous tumult which greeted that
assassination

 cw chal cha

  the jews on the front bench
stamped with their feet their faces
illuminated while an improvised
chorus sang this funereal hymn

  krausa zariezali kak porostenka
  rvastoun me pietouchitsia bole he

  once more the charm worked
divided for an instant by interest
all these men fraternized anew in
hate medviedoff replaced the copy
of the newspaper in his letter-bag
and invited the assembly to vote on
the propriety of his action

  stapfer followed the debate with
a sense of consternation several
times a phrase came to his lips
 you are working for germany
but it choked in his throat under
the threatening glances of the com-
munist from the caucasus if he
had been called on to explain he
would have found in his swiss skull
only arguments of great good sense
to oppose to theirs and these peo-
ple talked so well yet he felt now
a strange discomfort the sort of ap-
prehension which a rational person
feels when thrust into an asylum
full of madmen as the uproar
increased he recalled the posters of
the rath museum-the poor old
man especially with his pitiful ex-
pression and the little child in his
arms

  krausa zariezali kak porosienka

  rvastoun me pietouchitsia bolche

  the chorus sang again while they
proceeded to vote by raising of
hands

  medviedoff had begun the ballot-
taking on the left where a majority
at once decided in his favor only
the jews delayed voting they
wrangled from habit and asked one

  they rut kminr ihroat hkn fl pige

 that irvlli trill tu-apffrr no lonprr

 anothers opinions to vote is in
 fact to give a judgment what ad-
 vantage would be conceded to them
 in return finally the general
 opinion was that medviedoff was
  proceeding too quickly

   too quick too quick the
 front bench bawled while the
 long hands with black finger nails
 were lilted to heaven one after an-
 other and the curls danced furiously

   suddenly in a pause which fol-
 lowed the hand-waving prazem-
 kines voice was heard

    comrade with what money
 shall we sustain the cause 

     es yes with what money
 answered the chorus of tews

     the central committee has de-
 clared itself able to pay the costs
 yillebot explained

    pardon me the central com-
 mittee recently made an appeal
 for fresh contributions answered
 prazemkine

    they all looked at one another

    it is exactly a month ago that
 the central committee asked for an
 advance he continued  the re-
 port of our comrade treasurer even
 pointed to a deficit

     yes yes a deficit

        caused by the presence of
 comrade mascarvigni at creusot
 how is it then     

   he could not finish all the
 benches were in uproar

     i tell you that the committee has
 money said medviedoff sharply

    even after porodzianskos de-
 parture 

    yes

    then prazemkine broke in
 again in a voice of thunder  i be
 of you vladimir ilitch tell us where
 the money comes from

   this was the question which med-
 viedoff feared this imbecile
 prazemkine was spoiling everything
 with his scruples
the moles



    ask you where the money
comes from vladimir ilitch

   yes yes the money the
money

  a yardful of madmen decidedly
as a dying fire is rekindled by a
single spark the agitation was re-
newed and became more violent it
was no longer a political reunion
which stapfer was attending but a
horse sale the tumult of an ex-
change at midday spectators and
brokers fighting among themselves
over their profits

   the central committee has
robbed us let it pay us back
porodziansko has carried the money
over the border abgereist aroub
aroub  

   silence   prazemkine com-
manded  you see very well that
i have something to say comrades
his arms crossed in his attitude
of a prophet planting himself before
the platform he cried

   vladimir ilitch swear to us
that you havent sold yourself out to
capitalism

   the central committee has ap-
proved my conduct

   let them produce the books 
  hear hear

  two camps formed now each
having guessed from the secretarys
first words the source of the credits

  medviedoff exasperated blurted
out the figures r

   the sub-committee has at its
disposal at present two hundred and
twenty thousand francs

  to pay for a twenty days strike
in the brechard-briquet villebot
interrupted

  i ask where the money comes
from prazemkine shouted once
more

  then in the tumult as medvied-
off opened his mouth to answer
something new happened

  gorochebnikoff had leaped on the

platform they heard the dull
sound of his body landing on the
wooden stage crumpled up his
legs crossed like a tailors keeping
his balance by waving his misshapen
arms he vomited forth pathetic im-
precations accusing in turn med-
viedoff the committee prazemkine
the bourgeois and the world in
general

  certainly the occasion was a good
one for a long time he had suf-
fered in his pride of a pariah at
medviedoffs success

  why should it be so to one
good fortune intelligence the re-
spect and adulation of the mob and
to the other himself only laughter
or disgust when he appeared-at
most the fear which the blind
strength of his arms inspired he
hiccoughed

   the money you ask where
the money comes from from
olebine ah ah i yes from
olebine who hands it to his
lackey 

  his throat rattled as he ran
across the platform like a cat shak-
ing his fist at medviedoff and re-
peating

  traitor traitor you area
traitor to the cause  lackey an-
swer me dirty seller-out 

   make him stop vladimir
ilitch  cried some indignant
women the jews highly amused
clapped their hands since the com-
mittee was rich its members could
now find means to reimburse them-
selves that was the essential
thing and so much the worse for
the capitalists if they had let them-
selves be tricked by this joker
vladimir the meeting moreover
quickly adopted that view the
figure of two hundred and twenty
thousand francs had dazzled them
only the purist prazemkine per-
sisted in his original indignation
io

world fiction

  go on vladimir ilitch go
on 

   the community receives as a
gift more than five thousand marks
he shouted

  bravos burst forth the deficit

was going to be made good

  the frightened gnome on the
platform was silenced the crowd
greeted his retreat with monstrous
epithets while this cry shot forth
on all sides

   hurrah for medviedoff  hur-
rah for the committee hurrah for
our illustrious vladimir ilitch 

  a little more and they would have
hurrahed equally for the two hun-
dred and twenty thousand francs

  prazemkine left the room in dis-
gust but before going he drew
himself up to his full height and fac-
ing the howling crowd hurled a
curse at medviedoff

   gorochebnikoff is right you
are bourgeois and jews the servants
of capitalism  karl marx 
hoots drowned out his voice

   your ten sous comrade
ouritzky insisted barring the way

  then stapfer believed the mo-
ment had almost come for him to
disappear the ballot by raising of
the hands gave medviedoff an over-
whelming majority almost a unani-
mous endorsement it wras a time
when the softening of all hearts re-
quired the co-working of lemonade
drunk to the great the universal 
in a voice which he tried to con-
trol but in which there was an accent
of triumph medviedoff read the
order of the day

   the subcommittee assembled
   etc    etc    having
considered    etc    gives
full power to the secretary of the
subcommittee to organize in col-
laboration with the secretaries of the
syndicates the complete cessation of
zvork in the factories of the canton

and of latin switzerland it ap-
proves the financial statement and
invites the people of geneva to an
imposing manifestation of interna-
tional and revolutionary solidarity

    is that all  medviedoff asked
placing on the table the paper conl
taining the order of the day which
the elegant villebot signed

  in the groups delegates were
questioning one another it was
the instant chosen by medviedoff to
play his big card to try to make un-
forgettable this meeting which
after threatening to break him had
vastly strengthened his credit

  the shade in the black cape re-
mained motionless

  yes is that all comrades
medviedoff repeated his voice in-
dicated clearly that he didnt think
so the crowd waited expectantly

    no it is not all he continued
and taking up the order of the day
he read

   welcomes with heartfelt emo-
tion the return to liberty of its
venerable grandmother maria
audreyevna brasovna

  the black veil and the cape were
cast aside they saw now on the
platform a little old woman with an
ample figure corpulent but full of
vigor who began to throw kisses into
the air while a formidable ovation
greeted her

  babushka babushka grand-
mother 

  brasnova there was a mo-
ment of stupor followed by de-
lirium the platform was almost
wrecked by an irresistible onset
prazemkine himself returned to the
room forgetting his tirade his
arms wide open

   babushka  babushka  grand-
mother  

  with amused gestures she de-
fended herself laughing and crying
by turns she deserved her nick-
the moles



name this robust peasant woman
whose will to live thirty years in
siberia they had been unable to
break down any more than they had
quenched her still juvenile enthusi-
asm for the cause which she had em-
braced maria andreyevna bras-
ovna whose name figured in every
committee report in homage to the
heroine of the red place more ven-
erated in the ceremonials of the
communist religion than vera
sassoulitch rosa luxembourg or
louise michel-the ancestress the
good grandmother the babushka of
the revolution

  now she spoke wiping her eyes
to which the warmth of this recep-
tion had brought sweet tears per-
fectly happy she tapped vladimirs
shoulder and scolded affectionately
that old trouble-maker prazemkine
who listened to her contritely and
as a sign of reconciliation kissed
medviedoff full in the mouth

    yes it is i it is i the devil
take me if they thought i had come
back these dear little people
dont squeeze me so hard you will
suffocate me  yes yes my children
grandmother is here grandmother
has returned from her trip to the
country of the militarists she al-
luded to her recent captivity in
germany and do you know what
they told her in the country of the
militarists they told her that
nikita nicholas is done for my
lambs-done for they will have
cut his throat within two months 

  she seemed to be telling some
marvelous legend to an audience of
little children-always animated
smiling with that little tear of ten-
derness which clung to the comer of
her dear eve

  his throat cut i his throat
cut and all of them-they will
cut the throats of all of them my
lambs a beautiful fete to which

grandmother invites you ah
there will be blood i promise you
in paris in london in rome in
petrograd blood blood  blood 
she sat down as if tired from
talking too much then she mur-
mured gently

   ah dear little people how
good it is to be among you again 
villebot who was buttoning his
gloves added

   i call your attention comrades
to the fact that we owe it to ger-
many that maria andreyevna has
been set free

   come a cheer for germany my
children 

   a cheer a cheer   villebot
repeated

  in an access of joyous enthusiasm
they responded

  to germany  to the strike in
the factories to babushka who
will lead the strike hurrah for
vladimir ilitch for the rebellion
for the revolution  

   i charge only twenty sous a
bottle cried pere ouritzky in his
sing-song voice

   foolishness ach foolish-
ness  

  who suddenly spoke those words 
the old man vladimir villebot
or was it simply stapfers ears
which began to buzz on leaving the
overheated hall while shivering in
the night air he traversed the peace-
ful sleeping city

  here is what was in the three
letters delivered on his eight oclock
tour by postman stapfer

   first letter

monsieur v  medviedoff

   your communication on the
subject of andrea hardly surprised
me it isnt in that direction that
i io

world fiction

we must look i think moreover
that the affair is making headway
since the arrival of young hunter
at the consulate it isnt any use to
play the entangling woman with
him a boy whom i am sure i can
lead by his-lips if i knew that
you were jealous my wolodja i
would tell you nevertheless that i
run a risk of being burnt myself at
that sport alas  you are not
jealous my dear and i love only
you thats the unfortunate part
of it 

   the consulate auto will continue
to go to the frontier to look for let-
ters from porodziansko as always
give your mail to gaby

   coco intends to postpone to
october  his festival of the allies
in that way mascarvigni gains two
extra days in which to cross the
french consulate is in a state of
ebullition i will show you a confi-
dential enclosure from the minister
which ought to interest you

   two words more i made a
scene with coco who balks at pay-
ing my note due to marval pass
along two thousand francs of ole-
bines to ouritzky so that he can
advance them to coco whatever
the latter may say he rzill end by
accepting them

   all my thoughts will be with
you tonight at the meeting have
courage i will be at your side-in
thought at least my love excuse
this scrawl for i write you in haste
while waiting for my manicure we
dine this evening at the royal with

   you took an unworthy advan-
tage of me i didnt want to make

a scene this evening at the consulate
thinking that you would come back
to your original decision besides
your secretary was there  have
too much esteem for that delightful

 -i underline it that delightful

 young fellow-to claim before him
 something you promised me all the
 same  ou should know at least
 that a man in your situation ought
 to keep his word and that you can-
 not treat the wife of the consul of
 sardinia as you would other women
 marval has been here twice to-day
 and i had to invent hard luck stories
 to get him to wait until to-morrow
 noon after that he threatens to
 present the note for settlement to
 my husband since you dislike to
 inform bel patek of your financial
 difficulties apply to ouritzky who
 is discretion itself i know that i
 am asking a great sacrifice of you
 my coco but is it my fault and
 oughtnt you to assume yourself the
 excessive expenditures into which
 your love has led you

    i thought for a moment that
your young secretary would perhaps
consent to advance me the necessary
sum i believe that he would be
glad to do it but that would be to
bring a stranger into our adventure
out of regard for your name and
mine i cant do that what is your
opinion

    on re-reading this letter i see
 that i have been unkind to you
 excuse me since this morning the
 annoyance which this stupid affair
 causes me has quite upset me and
 to think that i must go to this am-
 bassadorial dinner when an evening
 alone with vou would be so delight-
 ful dearest

     is it true that things are going
 badly in france at all events till
 to-morrow at ten oclock at the

  for whom did they dance that
evening for the war blind
the prisoners or the refugees from
the north nobody could have
told-not even villieu who had
sent orders from paris to hold the
fete for he was headstrong and
obstinate the old fool turning over
that same idea always in his rudi-
mentary skull

  propaganda we were neglect-
ing propaganda propaganda was
necessary without it france would
fall i

  such were his exhortations re-
proaches and suggestions-a whole
medley of documents encumbering
the official mail

  in default of the great offensive
which afvva denounced amid the
plaudits of the left paris arranged
for the spring trip by the brave
general pied a tour by sarah bern-

hardt and concerts by mayol in the
twenty-eight cantons every day
the cornavin station saw arriving
some valiant little woman ready to
gamble with the hereditary enemy
for the important secrets which
would bring us victory

   it is your turn aid us in
propaganda   villieu repeated in-
cessantly and millions hew away
in propaganda eating up half
of our credits melting like snow
under the sun

  ah rheims might burn without
hope of restoration the throat of
the north might rattle under the
enemys heel the hospitals might
vomit out their dead for lack of
serum or quinine and thousands of
poor devils forgotten by the red
cross might die of hunger in the
prison camps in germany these
negligences did not halt the great
bureaus propaganda gentlemen
propaganda i have never seen any-
thing more like a dance of death
than villieus propaganda

   let us have a ball said m de

we went to work in a week the
basler-hof which its proprietor
schwanzbach also from basle cer-
tainly transformed in the hotel
des beiges for the occasion was
scraped cleaned and made ready for
the fete the ariana furnished the
green plants the kursaal orchestra
was bought up for the evening
for a whole week the carpenters the
decorators the painters-in fact all
the crafts in geneva-were hard

sul with rage in his heart could see
pass by his windows great furni-

  alas fatality that intractable
world fiction

coquette was on the watch one
morning m de maiongrin rushed
into the consulate panting

   hunter the flags we forgot
the flags i 

  there was a moment of anguish
we could never find enough allied
flags in geneva and it was too late
to write to lyons nevertheless a
propaganda fete without flags-
what a disaster but fatality was
appeased an hour later gerber
and streif representatives of wert-
heim offered us a collection
ordered in advance from their house
in stuttgart and in the bargain two
plaster busts one of the  good
general jofitre the other of the
heroic gallieni

  this incident of the flags was
moreover only a brief paragraph in
the long chapter of our difficulties
the most serious was to find a suit-
able date everybody spies in-
cluded wanted to be associated in
our propaganda and all the ladies

                        adrio val

                    from the rumanian by hfwrietie sava-goiu

a dr to val ees born in rumania december   her child-
hood was passed in france as a very small girl she displayed
marked literary inclinations and began to write verses and
novels which she carefully concealed from friends and family
she has contributed to the majority of rumanian magazines and
during the war published a daily article in the newspaper
 romaniashe has also done work as a dramatic critic

her own creative work includes plays novels and especially
poetry she came to the united stales in  and has lectured
extensively on rumanian subjects

 quasi i miiiiiiuiiiriiniiiiiiiiiiibniiiiwsniiiuuuaaaiuun

 i am ned moon shouted
 j a hoarse voice from the
dark cabin  come away
from the moon dye hear me 
before the porch with its black
hole for a door the gray beach
slept in the still night  a
little further off the black sea
moaned against the rocky shore and
shivered under the caress of the
moonlight   

  motionless her face lifted to-
wards the moon jasmina seemed
not to hear the thundering voice
then a giant bent almost double
came through the low door he
suddenly stood erect unbelievably
tall in the pearly light with coal-
black eves like two sins at the gates
of hell

   come away will ye she used
to do the same    and she had
to die 

  outlined against the sky he
pointed his gigantic brown finger
at her with an air of violent menace

at last jasmina looked at him
seeming to tear herself with pain
from some world of her own and
meeting his glance she trembled for



a second the shadow of a smile
wandered across her face her
lips moved slowly

   yes ill come in  

  the giant stared at her and every
wrinkle of his powerful face deep-
ened in a fearful expression

   girl she used to love it too   
too much and she died    re-
member 

  jasmina moved slowly towards
the cabin like a strange flower in
some old tale white and slender
with a moonpale forehead and deli-
cate hands seeming rather a crea-
tion of fairylight than a mans child
only her eyes the eyes of the old
devil burned beneath her eye-
lids like two flames-messages
from a world of passion and pain
  

  the old devil entered the dark
cabin first and jasmina lighted a
small pine torch in a kind of primi-
tive lantern putting it on the round
block of wood which served as a
table in the house

  the filthy misery of the cabin
trembled suddenly in the uncertain
flame on the black-red floor there
jasmin a the flower of dobrodja

us

was a vague noise from several
baskets of fish like a faint struggle
for life and all kinds of fish nets
hung on the walls over and under
the two horrid chairs and the small
bed covered with unwashed oil-
cloth two broken ship lanterns
hung above the dirty couch

  one corner stood apart from
the rest of the miserable cabin
-a different world hidden in
branches   

  without a word jasmina crossed
the small room and let herself fall
in the midst of this tiny garden
that was the girls couch-rough
but fragrant with the aroma of
plants which jasmina changed every
day the branches bruised her
skin but their odor perfumed her
heart she remained there mo-
tionless her eyes open glowing in
the dark still veiled with the silver
of the outdoor night she didnt
recognize herself in those moon-
lit hours but felt as though she were
in another universe drunk with
shimmering light full of sufferings
and of joy

  the girls love for the moon was
known in the fishing village and
everybody now called her as omar
the wise one in the square had
named her jasmina the moon-
child omar also called her the
only flower of dobrodja for in
that village lost in the most arid
part of the coast of dobrodja
jasmina in her colorful tatters and
her pale beauty seemed to those
people harried by life something
like a flower in the desert

   it was the poorest of all the vil-
lages of the coast inhabited almost
entirely by silent turks who worked
hard at their fishing the black
sea is rebellious and not even a
summer day can calm its restless-
ness the turks in the village
fanatic and silent indifferent to

their inclement destiny had one
single consolation the prayers of
the muezzin whose pathetic voice
called from his blue tower five times
a day to raise the souls of the faith-
ful from misery towards allah   -
and that is what they could not
forgive in the old devils life
mehmet selim most miserable of
a miserable village never crossed
the threshold of the mosque he
never looked towards the sky of
allah never noticed his humble
muezzin five times even day of
his life he scorned the only promise
of hope these victims were allowed
he scorned the roses of allah and
the turks said his heart was the
nest of starless nights a cloud
of mystery hung upon the head of
this dark-faced man who lived far
from the other cabins on the very
edge of the shore no one in the
village ever remembered having seen
him smile during all his life he had
never been heard to greet a neigh-
bor usually he was at sea from
dawn until night occasionally he
passed through the village his
basket full of the products of his
mysterious fishing to sell them god
knows where

  during the long winter nights the
fishermen used to whisper strange
things about mehmet selim   
a kind of superstitious terror sur-
rounded his cabin for them so that
no one ever approached it when on
rare occasions they had to pass that
way they preferred to walk a few
more miles and make a detour but
everyone dearly loved jasmina the
devils child as different from selim
as a moonbeam from a rock the
girl played with the children helped
the women in their work had kind
words and a smile for everybody
nursed them when ill-and not be-
ing able to help them with money
as she never had a penny for her-
world fiction

self she used to go far away over
the hills and bring them plants to
enliven their gloomy homes

  and they adored her one must
be very poor to feel the emo-
tion of receiving a flower    
with the reverence one would feel
for some fairy one couldnt un-
derstand knowing only that she was
there to bring sunshine into their
worn-out hearts she was to
them the benediction of the moon
created of its very rays to pass
mercifully through their bitter lives
   they knew by tacit agree-
ment that if it were necessary not
one of them would ever hesitate
to give his poor life for the  moon
child  perhaps they would
have hesitated to interfere with the
old devil but that wouldnt have
been a matter of life but of
losing the soul so they thought
but jasmina only laughed when
they asked in hushed voices about
mehmet and they looked wor-
riedly at each other and prayed to
allah in the secrecy of their hearts
everyone remembered what had
been said for so many years about
the devil and jasminas mother   
one of the stories at least seemed
to be true for even the gravest and
least credulous believed it

   twenty years ago they said
 during one of those december
nights when sea and sky thundered at
each other and many of the
cabins were swept away by the
loosening of the elements a
foreign steamer sank
near the rocks fac-

ing the village one could hear the
deadly screaming of the fright-
ened passengers and see frightened
torches flashing in the darkness the
whole village stared terrified the
mere thought of putting out to their
rescue seemed mad but that very
night an unheard-of thing happened
the devil silent as usual had
jumped into his bark and in a second
had vanished from sight between
two liquid mountains

  trembling the muezzin went to
the mosque to implore the proph-
et s pity for those who were drown-
ing and for the unfaithful mo-
hammedan who had gone to meet
death

  petrified the village watched
until the dawn lighted its livid
lantern  as the sun broke in
an explosion of bright rays the
jasmina the flower of dobrodja

black sea breathed deeply suddenly
calm and its waves sang from the
shore to the distant horizons sweep-
ing away all traces of the nights
disaster

  no one had seen mehmet selim
return to shore   

  for two weeks there was no sign
of him    but one night a boy
came back to the village telling
them breathlessly that he had ap-
proached the devils cabin and had
seen mehmet sitting on the rock be-
side his porch holding a very fair
woman in his arms in a wrild em-
brace and that she was sobbing and
crying   

  for two years the village knew
that a foreign woman-slim like a
tall lily-luminous as they could
never imagine a human being-with
eyes as blue as the lakes of the
prophets paradise-lived over
there in the cabin

  sometimes they met her her tiny
dancing feet barely touching the
earth a smile wandering around her
pale lips a curious expression in the
blue eyes her golden braids crowning
her like a princess seeming hardly
conscious of them the young
fisherwomen catching sight of the
blond vision wiped their moist eyes
with their aprons and the old ones
shook their fists     allah let
him not breathe thy clean salt air
any longer he has driven her
mad allah  

  the fairy is mad said the
girls thoughtfully and the children
became silent when she passed
whispering to each other

   the princess is mad you
know 

  and during the first year of her
life in the village a child cried in the
cabin    and the muezzin
prayed again in the mosque for the
devils crime and the little ones

happiness he humbly asked allah
never to give back to the blond
woman her clear mind of yore that
she might not realize that she was
lost in a nightmare   

  but a peculiar thing happened
during the second year of her life
there mirak a gypsy lautar
came from argesh a rumanian
province with his singing laura
and camped quite near mehmets
cabin either ignorant of the super-
stitions which surrounded the place
or not being impressed by them

  he was a handsome tall boy with
a red mouth beneath the silky
moustache and big eyes-eyes full
of gypsy passion and yet of tender-
ness   

  they said that his playing could
move even the gloomy rocks from
the shore and that the sea used to
stand still listening to his songs
   omar the wise one swore that
he had seen her the last night they
ever knew anything about the
stranger wandering along the shore
with mirak and may allah have pity
on their souls-the gypsy played to
enchant even the distant horizons
and she was crying softly and the
haggard expression of her face was
gone    after that not a living
soul saw them any more the blond
woman and mirak disappeared   

  some of the fishermen said that
the old devil sawr them one evening
from his boat holding hands and
took them both out in his bark into
the wide distances    the fact is
that selim returned alone to shore

  had he really put out their eyes
as many said so that they shouldnt
see each others face before they
died allah alone knows and
mohammed his beloved prophet

  twenty years had passed since
that day and jasmina the daughter
of the fairy and the devil charmed


world fiction

the miserable village with the smile
of her being   

  only omar shook his head doubt-
fully talking about the burning fire
of her eyes-the eyes of mehmet
selim

  that may sunday had been a
burning day the sun streaming down
like liquid fire over the coast a hot
evening fell heavily covering sea
and land with glowing shadows   
jasmina sat motionless on a brown
rock by the dusty road which fol-
lowing the tormented shore led
somewhere far away to a town with
people dressed in silk and living in
cool palaces-a town they said was
named constantza

  her eyes half closed her childish
lips opened like a pomegranate
flower drinking sunshine jasmina
blended every fairy-tale she had
ever imagined with the stories she
had heard about constantza and
rumania and all the marvels of the
unknown wide world    sud-
denly she laughed aloud   

  what did she care about the wide
world could there be a wider
world for her than the seas and skies
and the miracle of moonlight

  with a beating heart she watched
the last blood rays of the incan-
descent sunset awaiting with long-
ing the first silver glance of the
queen of the night

  a last flame kissed the sky and
there was nothing left but a blue
mist floating over the black sea and
the handful of ashes of roses spread
on the moving horizon 

  the thin half-moon trembled in
a vague halo of silver-melancholy
like a broken ring   

  jasmina was trembling too her
face lifted in an all forgetful hap-
piness

  constantsa famous summer resort on the
 plaelc sea in rumania

  	hen a tide of harmony filled the
air-caressing her like a stream of
subtle waters   

  a long trill rose and fell and rose
-touching the broken ring in the
sky   

  what was it was it the star
song or the moons whisper   

  jasmina didnt want to know
the music came nearer and nearer
   it was as if the longings of a
thousand souls sang in those flute-
like trills telling of old sorrows
asking for a hope   

  suddenly the girl awoke from her
dream  a tall young man stood
before her dressed in a white cos-
tume all embroidered with a little
flute in his right hand and a big
black hat in his left smiling he
stood there the personification of
glorious youth    she stared at
him with childish eyes as though in
a deeper dream than before the
stranger still smiled and asked her
something in an unknown language
which sounded sweet to her ear
she couldnt understand but it was
as though a ray of moonlight had
glided into her very soul

  all in the village knew about the
love and secret betrothal of jasmina
and dan the shepherd from argesh
and the village although composed
of turks approved of the choice of
their moon child but the village
sank into silence when it remem-
bered selim the devil everyone
had already learned to love dan
who had come to dobrodja on his
way to buy fish and sheep for his
own village

  he knew their turkish dialect a
little and jasmina had already
learned rumanian with the speed
given to the human heart by love

  everybody could read in her
flowerv face how happy she was
   but she had always stopped
jasmina the flower of dobrodja

dan when he had wanted to ask
selim for her

  she didnt quite know why but
she trembled every time she asked
him to wait a little longer  were
they not happy like that  wander-
ing side by side in the sun flames
holding hands in silence in the
silvery nights talking for hours
on some rock far into the sea or
rocked violently by the black waves
in their canoe     werent they
happy planning with hushed voices
-mysterious with hope-their home
over there in argesh  it was to be a
white house on a green hill-with a
thatched roof like a big hat-and
the little windows full ot red carna-
tions and the wide balcony with its
pots of geranium

  the house would be the cleanest
in the whole argeshelul village and
she would be the quickest at work
and the most beloved wife of all the
young wives in the province of
argesh

  old stana dans white-haired
mother would love her so much
   and mad his father would
tell her all the stories of the country
-as they sat thoughtfully gathered
around the winter fire during the
long nights-or cheerfully on the
threshold as the summers twilight
fell 

   jasmina and sundays we shall

 o	to the little church bent over the
ill the old church you know-with
all its saints in red clothes and with
golden beards  

  yes she was happy    she
didnt think or rather she didnt
want to think about possible obstruc-
tions that might suddenly rise in her
road only when dan became too
impatient to ask selim that he might
take her away to the nest in
argeshelul an oppression overcame
her and something like an iron claw
pressed her throat    she didnt

want to think-she didnt want
to   

  dan resigned himself to waiting a
jew weeks more not understanding
her patience but his love for her was
stronger than his desire to call her
his own and the complicity of the
village to keep silence and secrecy
and to wait-to wait a little more
still-although it seemed unnatural
to him in a way paralyzed his eager-
ness to carry away the beloved

  it was a tropical june afternoon
drowned in melted gold jasmina
and dan were on their rock the gray
ditt lost in the waves of the sea
which was almost translucid with
feverish heat that day    and as
the lovers sat immobile they seemed
a symbol of tenderness at the edge
of an abyss

  violet night fell over the world-
the sun dropped into the sea like a
bleeding urn   

   jasmina beloved-lets go to
the house on the green hill jas-
mina   

  fear took hold of her suddenly
and hiding her head in dans arms
she shivered

   oh yes-lets go dan lets go
   take me away-take me
away  

  like a frightened child she cried
calling him by names whose meaning
he did not understand    and
clinging to him with her nervous
arms   

   dan    something fearful is
happening    dan    and as
he tried to rise to look around to
assure her she screamed and clung
to him with all her strength

  	dan if you ever loved me
dont look-dont look    dan
   i will die if you look   
dont look    dont look  

  there was such anguish in her
words that dan sighed and holding


world fiction

her closer forgot everything in his
effort to calm her

   i wont look dearest calm
yourself i wont i swear it    

  so they couldnt see mehmet
selim disappearing behind them as
silently as he had come   

  he had anchored his black bark a
few minutes before near their boat
and the old devil had climbed the
grayrock carefully suddenlv appear-
ing a foot from the place where they
stood a convulsion had distorted
his face and his gigantic hand had
risen in a menace towards the sky
and had sought the short knife in his
belt

  he started towards them-then
he stopped abruptly stood a moment
as though petrified and disappeared
behind the gray rock now he was
running as fast as he could with
a jump he was in the boat and in
another moment out of sight into
the night

  it was the next monday that the
village saw the curious thing it will
remember forever mehmet selim
coming among them and saying
 good morning and smiling and
talking     smiling talking
he had spoken to them so the
old devil was becoming human
was happiness to be allowed jas-
mina after all

  mehmet selim was comine back
to mankind in his old age the old
devil remembered he had a heart
oh how glad they were for their
moon child   

  the soft-hearted muezzin went
to the mosque alone to add a prayer
to his five daily ones thanking the
almighty allah for touching the
sinners heart	i

  in another week or so the
astonished village discovered that
mehmet selim and the rumanian
were friends and they rejoiced and

were cheerful for the horizon of

jasminas life seemed to clear up   
only omar scalded them angrily
herd of lost sheep cant you
see through the devils grim smile

	oull never reach mohammeds
paradise you stupid ones he
wouldnt let such a breed as yours
in cant you see the devil is fix-
ing some trap through his friendship
with the boy i tell you if the last
day oi this week jasmina and the
boy are not far away sunday it will
be too late we must send them
away do you hear me or they will
die as truly as i can read good and
evil in the faces of allahs sons
but the village laughed and
answered that he was a fool and a
devil himself to see only evil things
even in allahs miracles

    stupid herd you shall cry above
your nonsense 

  saturday morning omar went in
secrecy to find jasmina his austere
face had something of the resolution
of a visionary

   my child he said and his
voice admitted no reply  i have
arranged for you and dan to leave
tonight at ten everything is ready
and i am going with you i shall
see you married by the old popa i
know on the right side of the dam-
bovitza in bucarest

  jasmina was already trembling
tears burning her eyelids

   but omar-i cant leave my old
father like that 

  omar grasped her arm violently
 you fool-youll go with me to-
night or youll never see the stars
of heaven again without a veil of
tears over your eyes  if you
should still be-alive 

tasmina looked at him amazed

  	alive- 

  omar was shaking her by both
shoulders

you fool you fool don t
jasmina the flower of dobrodja

you want to live dont you want
to be happy do you want him
killed dont you understand that
the devil will never forgive you for
loving and for loving a chris-
tian ha you are a stupid child
-selim is a mad devil-dan
doesnt know-and somebody must
save you all from yourself or allah
shall punish him too for having seen
the misfortune approaching without
bringing help 

  jasmina was crying

   but i cant-i cant abandon
him he is old now we will just
talk to him tell him all about our
love he will understand he will
feel omar how holy our tender-
ness is i cant-go-like that- 

  with a movement of anger omar
pushed her aside with such violence
that she nearly fell and went away
scolding aloud at human imbecility
and making large gestures towards
the sky

  jasmina awoke the next day with
a sad presentiment she tried to
smile persuading herself that it was
only that madman omar whose
visions had frightened her the dav
before   

  but when she got out into the
bright sunshine instead of fading
away the blackness wrapped itself
still stronger around her beating
heart    good allah why why

  she started towards the village
not realizing precisely what she was
doing her fear increasing with
every step she could feel the beat-
ing of her temples like the blows
of a hammer all over her body she
arrived breathless and approached
a little group of fisher folk good-
humored and laughing in the gay
sunday

   itello jasmina cried one of
them  here comes our moon
child our flower may the
morning bathe thy white feet in

clear dew all the days of thy life 
but they stopped looking at her
haggard face

   whats the matter child for
the love of allah what has hap-
pened  and an old fishers wife
put her arms around her

  jasminas voice reached them like
an uncertain echo

   have you seen dan 

   why yes child -answered
several voices

   we were just rejoicing over his
friendship with selim father selim
just took him for a litde pleasure
trip in his fine old boat this morn-
ing the old man was all right
and joking they went  

  but the last words were lost for
jasmina all the terrors of the earth
in her eyes-had slipped stiff and
white to the feet of the startled
people   

  omar who just approached the
place stood still looking intently at
them then he glanced at the sea
shook his head and folding his arms
on his chest remained there motion-
less like a prophet whose warnings
have been ignored

  two weeks had passed since that
bright sunday when jasmina
had known by her presentiment
that misfortune was at hand the
old devil and dan never came
ashore again and the village was
sunken in sorrowful silence omar
froze them with his disdainful
glance which clearlv said

   stupid beasts  told you to take
care 

  he had spoken only once since
and that was to explain that the
devil had probably realized all of
a sudden that he loved the child of
his blood too much to kill her and
even too much to see her killed by
sorrow he knew she was of a
breed-his own-whose passions


world fiction

were deadly    so he had decided
to die himself but to punish the
guilty one who had crossed their
road to take away his child   

 and omar added- perhaps

selim began to like-yes to like--

the young dan because jasmina
loved him-and mad with anger
against himself he sent his own soul
to everlasting death  

  but no one was listening to omar
everybodys heart was broken by
the sight of jasmina-a shadow of
the old jasmina haggard immobile
drowned in distress her glance lost
upon the treacherous sea   

  they watched her fearing some
evil might befall her as she seemed
to have almost lost her mind or at
least every interest in surrounding
things and people

  one sunday evening just three
weeks after the unhappy day they
lost sight of her and everyone be-
gan to look anxiously for the girl

  omar went too silent and dis-
dainful wtithout a word he entered
his bark and steered the boat
towards the gray rock-the lovers
place    the blue bark was
there trembling in the breeze like a
broken leaf and like the old devil
some weeks before omar appeared
on the rock behind jasmina   

  she stood erect-her glorious
hair floating in the wind    she
looked far away over the moaning
waters staring at a moving spot as
in a trance 

  she was seeing the little black

bark and selim and dan laughin
and joking 	

  adc then suddenly without a
word selim had turned the boat over
and laughed    laughed   

  and she could see dan struggling
to take hold again of the bark and
the old devil pulling him back
and laughing   

   for the last time her be-
loved one rose in distress his head
above the water and his homesick
look embraced the horizon

  then the black sea drank in his
face

  jasmina cried-a loud sob so
loud that it rose above the desperate
voice of the sea

  abruptly she stopped  she
could hear him    yes  he
was calling  it was his beloved
voice   

   jasmina i 

  with a cry jasmina stretched out 
both her arms and leaped

  yes    i come   

  omar had not moved a finger to
stop the moon child from her
destiny his arms crossed on his
chest he stood motionless and ex-
pressionless

   may the path of allah be
blessed in all times   

  the pale moon was slowly lift-
ing its broken silver ring over the
seas and the muezzins voice
tinkled clearly in the violet evening
imploring the pity of allah for the
souls of his forgotten earth

   it may be the result of our steady
fiction diet that makes us find ser-
mons in stones or to be more exact
the emotion and sensation of fiction
in strictly-speaking non-fiction a 
sources though as a matter of
fact the two books we have in mind
are non-fictional chiefly in form

  the red garden knopf
from the danish of henning keh-
ler is a series of situations and sil-
houettes out of red russia the
author puts them forth as his experi-
ences while connected with the
danish legation at moscow in
 his work in the interests
of the red cross took him all over
russia

  the book is in an unflaggingly
cheerful vein that is to say the au-
thor is he recounts his escapes
from sudden and unpleasant death
his eleventh hour rescues with the
same lack of indignation or rancour
as he handles episodes more foreign
to his own person which if prop-
erly treated would cause insomnia
for a week as for instance when
the conscientious red commissar
orders a soldier shot without five
minutes delay whom an old wom-
an accuscs of having robbed her of
a hundred-ruble note please under-
stand that the commissar regrets
the incident quite-perhaps i should
say almost-as much as the soldier
but duty orders discipline etc
then when a little later the woman
discovers the money absent-mindedly
tucked away in a forgotten pocket
the commissar has her shot too as
the only way out of the situation

   if ones credulity is taxed from
time to time immediately comcs the
reflection that these things could
have happened even if they didnt

  and the scene where the sailor
expresses all the class hatred that
has been pent up for centuries by
plucking out a hair and dropping it
in the soup of his vis-a-vis in a sta-
tion lunch room an ex-officer in the
imperial navy alter three plates
of soup have been utterly ruined-
this was in  when the inhab-
itants of russia could still be fas-
tidious about such trifles - the
annoyed and exasperated officer
shoots the sailor and blows out his
own brains a slight slump in the
lunch-counters trade followed

  the fictional emotion here comes
from the fact that russia and con-
ditions in russia are now in the
realm of the fantastic and facts
no longer in a form to exert pressure
on our minds

  this in a measure explains the
emotion of john dos passos
 rosinante to the road again 
doran in spite of three cen-
turies spain is still the fatherland
of don quixote and one may in
the words of sancho find a dul-
cinea behind the least-expected bush

  the interesting young author of
 three soldiers  is in spain in
 questure  of a gesture he
sees it on every hand in the gypsy
dancer pastora imperio as she
walks across the stage quietly un-
hurriedly stopping at the footlights
the fingers of a brown hand above
her head snapping an insistent
rhythm in belmonte the torero
as he turns his back on the baffled
bull and walks off his red cape drag-




world fiction

ging on the sand after him and
especially does he hear it in the
fifteenth century verses of jorge
manrique on the death of his
father which are as meaningful
for the spaniard of today as they
were for the poets contemporaries
mr dos passos defines this gesture
as  an instant swagger-swagger
for lack of a better word-of de-
fiance in the midst of a litany to
death the all-powerful on every
hand the recognition-not to say
worship-of death the conqueror
and side by side with it an overpow-
ering individualism in highest and
lowest the longing to leave an im-
press on the stars and the only
solution of such a conflict is right in
the maw of death to look as though
you didnt care accept the useless-
ness of the struggle but dont cringe
and not only do not avoid death
but go half way down the road to
meet him and as death is ever
present you must not for a moment
lay aside the gesture lest he catch
you unawares

  we accompany mr dos passos
all over spain a-foot and on mule-
back always encountering the gest-
ure yet never able to describe or
reproduce it to our entire satisfac-
tion we visit tabcrnas and col-
menas we drink yellow andalusian
wine we divert ourselves hugely in
carnival time we visit circles of
artists and literati we talk with
everyone we meet on the road and
always-and everywhere-we hear
the monotonous insistent snapping
of pastoras fingers as in accom-
paniment to manriques warning

     como se va la vida

    como se viene la muerte

     tan callando

  and incidentally mr dos passos
gives us some of the keenest and
soundest criticism of spanish social

 problems literature and the spanish
 character that has been written in a
 long time

  we reprint another exquisite ef-
fusion from the colossus-of-rhodes-
like  secession which stands with

are you shackle
repressed desire

psycho-analysis the new miracle science proves that
most people live only half-power lives because of repressed sex
instincts outwitting our nerves the clearest simplest most
daringly candid book ever written on the subject is freeing
hundreds from life-long handicaps and showing the way to
health happiness and success

you too can be free

 arc you a slave to dissatisfaction lack of con-
fidence doubt anxiety fear worry self-deprecia-
tion lark of interest in outside affairs pessimism a
fixed belief in your own powerlcssness along what-
ever lines it may be

  these and hundreds of similar complaints arc generally a
matter of nerves seventy-five per cent of all cases of ill
health and menu inefficiency are due to dis-
jointed thinking the trouble is not physical
but pysuuc it is caused not by lack of energy
but by misdirected energy not by overwork or
nerve depletion but by ailscosception
huothfsal cosfuct repressed is-
stixcts and blried memories

  science has discovered that our sub-conscious
mind-the submersed nine-tenths of the human
mind-frequently behaves like a very devil within
us on the other hand when rightly used it can
become our greatest asset an understanding of
our inner self nrt only eradicates the difficulties
that hold us back but reveals new sources of
power that are almost superhuman

a startling discovery

  the world is indebted to sigmund freud a
viennese psychologist fur a remarkable discovery
which oversliadow the discovery of radium or
even electricity in  freud began a series
of experiments which led him into paths hitherto
forbidden when he reported to the world that
out of hundreds of nervous patients he was un-
able after the most careful analysis to find one
whrse illness did not have some relation to
their love life lie was met by a storm of protest
from all quarters people had been taught to look askance at
the reproductive instinct and to shrink from realiziuk the vital
pur which sex holds in human life but despite public dis-
approval he mtn of other scientists and the resistance of
his wn inner prejudices freud kept on

  to-day thr - lentihc world admits his theories were correct
md chit hi methods will free people from obsessions fears
and physical symptoms before which other methods are
powerlesas

freuds daring teachings in plain langoage

  until recently this wonderful discovery has been cloaked in
mystery literature on the subject was so technical and in-
volved tliat it could only be understood by the professional
reader

 but  most remarkable new book outwitting our
nerves has u-t been published based upon the personal
practice of dr josephine a jackson one of the foremost
exponents of psycho-analysis in america this book explains
lust what psycho-analysis is it is written in such a simple
interesting way that dr jacksons methods can be understood
and practiced by anyone anywhere

 mer of a doubt that

 the united states could
