money when x went to coyne but through
your employment department x was able
to work for my room and board three days
after graduating you got me a good job with
a battery and electric shop and a year later
x bought a shop of my own x now have a
 car and a thriving business-all paid

school if mr lewis hadnt gotten me a part-
time job yet x finished the course in twelve
weeks and the school immediately placed me
in a fine electrical job how x am chicago dis-

than x ever dreamed of making before x went
to coyne x am convinced that there is but
one right way to learn electricity and that

is the way of the coyne school-by doing
actual electrical work yourself
under expert instructors on full-
size running electrical machinery
and equipment

  for thirty years coyne has been training
men for responsible big-pay electrical jobs-
not by books or correspondence
but by an amazing way to teach that makes
you a practical expert in  days you need
no advanced education or previous experi-
ence x dont care if you dont know an arma-
ture from a generator if youre sixteen years
old or forty it makes no difference t
i will prepare you for a fascinating big-pay
electrical job in twelve weeks time x will
allow you your railroad fare to chicago-help
you get part-time work while at school-and
ive you every assistance in locating just the
job you want when you graduate

says you can make
 to 
a week

  before going to coyne z made thirty
cents an hour x borrowed the money for
my tuition and you got me a part time job
that took care of my expenses x graduated
in twelve weeks returned home and started
doing wiring on contract in a years time
i had paid for my schooling bought a car
and had a nice shi

his advice-
o to coyne

  some fellows try to learn electricity by
just working at it others send away for cor-

respondence courses in it but my advice to
anyone who really wants to learn electricity
is to go to coyne they have all the

electrical equipment right in the school that
you will ever see in the field no pictures
or useless theory they show you just
how to do everything you will have to do on
the job

  before going to coyne x took a corre-
spondence course in electricity but it was
too deep for me and x lost interest then x
got your catalog saw how you let the stu-
dent actually work on electrical equipment
and decided to go to coyne at that time
i was only making  a week now i make

discs

                     by t oconor sloane phd

if we cut a circle out of paper or piece of wood we have
what is called a disc of course the minute a disc becomes
of any thickness it may be classed as a cylinder but for our
purposes we will call anything circular in shape and width
and with parallel sides a disc no matter how thick it is it
will be curious to see what an enormously important part the disc
plays in this world of ours presumably the first method of
transporting goods over the surface of the earth was with a
sled which had to be dragged along in going a mile a person
had to overcome or contend with one mile of friction to reduce
the amount of friction a pair of discs were taken holes bored
through their centers mounted on an axle thus forming the basis
for a cart here the mileage friction was reduced to a few feet
according to the relation of the circumference of the axle to
the circumference of the disc which we will now call a wheel

  and this utterly improved mechanism the wheel and axle has
proved to be one of the most important things in all this world
of ours the vehicles which crowd our streets so that it is a
problem how the pedestrian can get across all go upon wheels
the thousands and thousands of miles of railroad all go upon
wheels and the enormous business which has been done in wall
street is based largely on wheels because not only railroads
but manufacturing concerns every business that uses machinery
is dependent upon wheels-upon our disc in the days that
homer tells of the chariot carrying a warrior with his aide was
a most important element in the army the poet describes the
putting together of a war chariot in preparation for the battle
showing what a wonderfully light trivial structure it was as it
had no springs the wonder is how it could keep together or why
its jumping about did not dislodge its occupants

  in old virginia the transportation of tobacco in great casks
by attaching journals to the heads and having horses drag them
along the casks rolling along behind them represents the same
thing-a collection as it were of discs

  when a disc is in rapid rotation it develops gyroscopic force
and this is what makes the spinning top preserve its equilibrium
makes it when displaced restore itself and come up to its vertical
axis of rotation again it is the force that is used on the gyro
scopic compass and on a larger scale on the stabilizing gyroscope
to prevent ships from rolling there are tons and tons of
cargo in ships which are controlled by a rotating disc the
gyroscopic force to which we have alluded is employed to keep
projectiles in their proper trajectory  the little pellet of lead
from the -calibre rifle and the -inch steel projectile from
the great naval guns are both set in rotation around their axes so
that each represents a cylinder made up of whirling discs and
the gyroscopic force prevents variation from their due course
and as we stop to think that every steam engine gas engine oil
water wheel is devoted to whirling discs around we will
see what an important part it plays in the mechanics of the world

  then as we come down to minutiae you will find in a little ten

cent glass cutter a minute disc of steel and this disc very hard and
sharp makes a mark upon glass which determines where it will
break it is in other words somewhat incorrectly called a glass
cutter but of course it doesnt cut again we have the smallest
type of disc doing a really wonderful work a ten-cent disc dis-
placing the very expensive diamond which previous to the in-
vention of this glass cutter was used by all glaziers

  the system of power represented in this country by factory
and by railroad by automobiles-are all based on the use of rota-
ting discs  the wheels must turn or industry ceases and the
same applies all over the world but there are some cases
where mechanical operations are carried on by percussion where
reciprocating action is used as the controlling process such
instruments are pile drivers riveters trip hammers and the like
which of course represent in the aggregate a very large
division of mechanics but the capital they represent and the
work they do is trivial compared to that done by rotation-by
turning wheels or discs

  we often hear stories about space flying-about the visits to
other planets to other celestial bodies and here we come across
a case where rotation is eliminated the action of the propeller
of an airplane is based upon the presence of air it screws its
way through air just as a wood-screw screws its way through
wood-or more comparably as a ship is driven through the water
by its propeller but at a very short distance from the earth-
say twenty or thirty miles-air is practically absent and alittle
further--that is if we get out into space at what may be termed
a cosmic distance from the surface of the earth we will be in
substantially a complete vacuum-and the propeller of an air-
plane might turn at any speed but it would have practically
no action whatever in drawing the plane through space-and here
we would have to come as far as we know to rocket propulsion
which amounts to the expulsion of gas at high velocity from the
rear of the plane the axes of the rocket or cases from which
the gases are discharged would be parallel with the axis of the
machine in other words we are definitely removed from the
idea of the whirling disc

  it would be easy to go on for a very long time citing the
cases to which the idea of a whirling disc may be made to apply
but the reader has only to think for a moment of how many
machines-for a watch or anything of that sort is a machine-
or mechanical appliances he can name in which the rotating
wheel or the rotating disc does not play an all-important part

  to take a very popular illustration of a disc we may take the
baseball the wonderful curves that the expert pitcher can
produce are based upon two things the gyroscopic action of a
rotating set of discs and the friction of its rotation against the
atmosphere through which it goes so even a worlds series
game depends largely upon the rotation of a set of discs of
graduated sizes


 the explorers

by harl vincent

author of bartons islandmicrocosmic buccaneersetc

    igantic telescopes of enormous power have been made and planets
vjt and satellites have been studied many millions of miles away even a fairly
good outline of the general conditions of mars and of the moon have been
evolved but what is happening on the other side of the moon no telescope
however powerful can penetrate the material of that satellite only a trip
to it could help us solve the mysteries of its hidden side still accepting cer-
tain hypotheses certain conclusions may be permissible mr vincent appar-
ently has been wondering about the subject in question and in his character-
istic manner gives us his views in an excellent piece of scientific fiction we
have asked mr vincent to give us a sequel so sure were we that you would
want it and we can promise even now that it will be worthy of its predecessor

illustrated by morey

signals from the moon

here is no need of searching for further
evidence ray this is conclusive proof of
your suspicion

  it certainly looks that way gary but
who will believe that beings exist on the
moon who could transmit such messages 

  ray parsons experimenter and inventor gazed quiz-
zically at his friend gary walton chief engineer of the
great international communications corporation

  uoh they wont believe us laughed walton but
neither did we believe that mars and venus were in-
habited until a few short years ago

  this is different it was long conceded by astrono-
mers that both of those planets had atmospheres and that
conditions were generally such that there was the possi-
bility of some sort of life existing on their surfaces
but the moon shows no evidence of this possibility
when viewed through our super-telescopes it has no
atmosphere at all or at least any atmosphere is so rare as
to be negligible the extremes of heat and cold
further preclude the possibility of it being inhabited
be that as it may we have here some facts that can
not be overlooked or contradicted

  gary walton tapped the several rolls of paper tape
that reposed on his desk top they had retired to
waltons office for a talk after almost thirty-six hours
of continuous work in the research laboratory of the
corporation whose engineering department was presided
over by gary the rolls of tape contained messages in
an unfamiliar dot and dash code

yes i know replied the inventor those mes-

sages were undoubtedly transmitted by intelligent beings
though we have no means of decoding them it is com-
paratively easy to show that the code is a real means of
communication that there are thirty-seven separate char-
acters recurring with varying frequency and that nine-
teen of these characters are the same as certain of those
used in continental morse this should prove the ex-
istence of a language and a code foreign to our earth-
the spaces between letters-the longer spaces between
words and all that the world might easily believe that
the messages come from another planet but not from
the moon-the body whose surface has been most closely
examined and on which we are certain there is no life
but the readings of the direction finders

  rays brow creased in perplexity that is the strange
part of it he said our indications are definite we
have followed the signals for many hours and the shift-
ing of our loops has kept constantly in line with our satel-
lite the signals can not have come from any other
point excepting by reflection

  reflection fiddlesticks snorted walton you
know as well as i do that such signals if they could reach
us from another planet by reflection from the moon
would also reach us directly and a line could be obtained
on their original source with our direction finders no
ray you are arguing against your own convictions
these signals come from the moon

  but how doggone it gary when lesser invented
the super-telescope in  the first thing he examined
was the surface of the moon with the tremendous
magnifying power it would be possible to see a sparrow
on the moons surface but he saw nothing living and
nothing living has been observed in the fifteen years dur-
ing which his instrument has been in use all over the


the face of the moon was in shadow but
shone with a fair degree of brightness

       world life has been found on mars and
on venus there is a fair evidence of its
existence on certain of the satellites of jupiter and
saturn but on the moon-never

nevertheless you must admit that our messages
came from the supposedly uninhabited satellite
yes admitted parsons slowly they did
but by all thats good and holy i cant account for
it and neither can you

  the young inventor sat slouched in his chair
disheveled and weary he was bewildered and
disgruntled over the findings of the recent experi-
ments in which he had requested the aid of the
older man true they had proved to their own
satisfaction the points they had set out to de-
termine ray had reached a similar conclusion
previously in his own workshop but had hoped
that the more powerful apparatus in the laboratory
of the great organization in wthose new york
headquarters he now sat would show his original
data to be erroneous it was too preposterous
he would not dare to publish his findings on ac-
count of the storm of protest that would come from
the great scientists with whom he was already at
loggerheads suddenly he pulled himself up and
laughed

  by george gary he said this thing has me
cuckoo but as you say fm convinced of the
correctness of our results and fm going to see
for myself whats  the moon before i let the
word out on these experiments

  through the telescope

  no siree fm going to go there and look around




amazing stories

  it was gary waltons turn to stare going there 
he gasped how 

  havent the slightest idea but ill build myself a
ship of some kind thatll get me there

  whats the advantage we can already observe the
surface as if from a distance of less than three hundred
feet by means of our telescopes why run the risk of
losing your life in some hare-brained attempt at shooting
yourself there in a rocket or something like that

  dont worry about me if i start i am going to get
there-and back and i do expect to find something
where in some fancied underground realm

  ray laughed once more now whos the kill-joy
he inquired a few minutes ago you were on the other
side of the argument

  the older man grinned oh go ahead he said
youll have your own way no matter how much i argue
but promise me you will take me along

  sure thing and im not joking about it either
  neither am i

  they gripped hands solemnly

  now what do you say we go home and knock off a
little sleep suggested walton

  best idea youve had since day before yesterday
lets go

  they indulged in much good-natured banter as they
washed up and prepared to leave the deserted building
it was well toward morning when gary locked the door
of his office behind them and they had a considerable wait
for the night elevator to rise from the street floor to the
ninety-fourth on which the office and laboratory were
located

  the night watchman was accustomed to the late com-
ings and goings of the two so he made no remarks re-
garding the lateness of the hour but when at the
thirtieth floor or thereabouts ray let forth a yell like a
comanche he was so startled that he let go of the con-
troller handle

  whats the matter asked gary in real concern
  ive got it by george ive got it

  got what 

  the solution he babbled excitedly what dumb-
bells we are not to have thought of it before the other
side-the other side of the moon thats where the
transmitter is

  the other side said gary blankly

  sure we only see the side that is toward the earth
and that is always the same who knows what is on the
other side the side that is always turned from us

  the watchman gaped as the two capered like school-
boys and when they left the elevator at the main floor
he scratched his head and wratched as they scampered
through the long hall to the exit of the building

  bug-house the two of them he said in deep
conviction

the meteor

during the succeeding four months gary wal-
ton saw almost nothing of his friend and when-
ever he reached him by radiophone he was re-
fused permission to visit the laboratory where ray was
so busily engaged

  no gary old man was the burden of his refrain
i have some ideas of my own i am following in the
construction of this ship and im just not going to let

anyone in on it until im sure its going to come up to
expectations

  but cant i help gary would ask

  not a bit everything is going fine and there is
nothing i need so please quit worrying about it

  but im getting anxious

  i know you are ray would laugh but you wont
have long to wait and i can promise you something
quite different from what you might expect

  further argument proved useless in each case and
gary finally gave it up as a bad job but he grew more
impatient as time passed and when ray ultimately noti-
fied him that all was in readiness he hastened to grand
central terminal and boarded the first train that would
take him to the small hamlet in monroe county where
rays laboratory was located

  ray parsons was an unusual figure in the scientific
world at his graduation from college he had spent two
years wandering about the world with nothing to do but
play instead of playing however he seized the oppor-
tunity of visiting the great universities and research
laboratories of europe there conferring with scientists
of note and occasionally making a stop of several weeks
to assist in some particularly interesting work that hap-
pened to be under way the young mans wealth and
ability found him a welcome abroad and he learned
much during this period incidentally contributing not a
little of his own knowledge and downright genius he
was recalled to new york at the untimely death of his
father and found himself an orphan possessed of more
riches than he knew what to do with the money he
promptly forgot excepting as a means to an end and he
straightway set about indulging himself in his hobby-
science he equipped one of the finest private labora-
tories in the united states and with a few assistants
buried himself in the work he had chosen the succeed-
ing ten years saw his rise to the position of an authority
of note-an authority of such preeminence that he was
continually subject to the critical and ofttimes caustic
animadversions of the savants who envied him his not-
able accomplishments but he remained unspoiled by
praise and unperturbed by criticism

  gary walton mused on these things as his train sped
northward his own case was quite different reared
in poverty he had been forced to start working at an
early age and had worked hard ever since he was
forty-six just ten years older than ray and had already
rolled up thirty years of experience that had begun with
the clerkship in the office of the first organization to com-
mercialize television-radio and bring it into the homes
of the nation from this small beginning he had
struggled upward growing up with the organization as
it eventually merged writh and obtained control of the
wire and cable companies the various broadcasting and
commercial radio corporations until it finally emerged as
the sole owner and operator of all communication systems
in use on earth his experience though in a specialized
line was highly valuable and the reward for his years of
hard work and self-education came in the not to be
despised position he now held

  when his train slowed down at the station he caught a
glimpse of rays low-slung red roadster and the smile on
the face of the inventor apprised him of the fact that an-
other engineering triumph had been achieved

  welcome to our city ray greeted him when he had
swung across the platform and approached the car
the explorers of callisto



  thanks grunted gary feigning sarcasm fm
welcome now that the work is done eh

  not sore are you 

  rays eyes twinkled he knew that his friend hated
being left out of anything until the last moment

  of course not-really but you might at least have
told me what you were doing

  he climbed in beside his grinning friend and they
were soon rolling along the main thoroughfare of the
town and headed for the outskirts

  the laboratory was a rambling group of buildings
some frame some brick and a few of moulded concrete
these were set well back from the road about a mile
from town and were separated from the neighboring
farm houses by broad rolling fields that comprised the
property ray had purchased after his fathers demise
gary noted that a considerable area to the rear of the
buildings had been walled off by a high board-fence
whose eight foot top was surmounted by several lines of
glistening barbed wire

  got the ship well hidden havent you he commented
as the car pulled up on the gravel drive alongside the new
fence

  you bet and were going to keep it hidden until
we have all the dope on these strange messages by the
way have there been any more 

  yes every five days as regular as clockwork they
begin at midnight and transmit for one hour and twenty
minutes they seem to have a regular schedule now
and i have a whole roomful of tape dont know what
we are ever going to do with it all unless we toss it out
of the window when there is another hero-parade up
broadway

  well were going to learn who is working the trans-
mitter up there on the moon anyway

  ray inserted his key in the lock of a heavy door in the
fence as he spoke when he swung this door open gary
gasped at what he saw at the near end of the enclosed
field

  why its nothing but an airplane he exclaimed

  with a few important differences his friend con-
ceded

  and the meteor as ray had christened the vessel
did indeed resemble a standard high speed enclosed
plane the body was some forty feet in length torpedo-
shaped and surmounted by a single wing-structure that
seemed ridiculously small and of unusual thickness on
the leading edge not more than twenty feet from wing
tip to wing tip did this plane measure the landing gear
was not unusual comprising the regulation rubber-tired
wheels and tail skid the tail structure was likewise of
conventional design with fins and rudder that might
have come from the shop of one of the standard airplane
manufacturers at the nose there showed the standard
propeller of gleaming bakelite the body was of polished
metal with the exception of numerous circular windows
that seemed to be of extremely thick glass surround-
ing the tapered tail and blunt nose of the body there
were a number of cylinders of about six inches diameter
and eight feet in length these looked for all the world
like the barrels of small cannon and gave the craft a war-
like appearance there was not a strut or a guy wire to
mar the symmetry of the whole or to destroy the impres-
sion of indestructible rigidity presented by the sleek
craft

  isnt she a beauty  asked ray enthusiastically

  sure is but what makes it go 

thoroughly equipped

the short rotund figure of an overalled man
emerged from a circular hatch and dropped to the
ground

  eddie dowling said ray hes going with us

  fine business anyone else

  no just we three he turned and addressed the
mechanic come here eddie

  oh hello walton i hear youre going with us

  this from the smiling-faced chubby dowling who
wiped his hands on a piece of cotton waste as he
advanced

  hello eddie havent seen you in ayear yes im
going along-think well get there said gary

  the smiling countenance became owlishly solemn
positively wait till you see this ship shes a
corker

  dowling went to the shop for some tools and ray and
gary climbed through the circular hatch into a small
chamber inside the vessel this chamber formed an air
lock and communicated with the interior through a
second circular hatch

  the center compartment of the meteor was about
fifteen feet in diameter and of approximately the same
length between the partitions separating it from the other
two sections there was a periscope arrangement that
provided an unobstructed view ahead and to the rear
from the pilots seat the circular windows in the double
cellular hull gave vision in all other directions there
were four bunks two upper and two lower besides two
comfortably upholstered double seats and a small table
that folded in beside the bunks the rest of this chamber
was cluttered with the controls and a mass of compli-
cated mechanisms most of which were entirely unfa-
miliar to gary

  in the forward compartment there was the fifteen-
cylinder radial engine and its fuel supply the motor be-
ing of six hundred horsepower rating the rear com-
partment contained the heating refrigerating and air
conditioning apparatus as well as the supply of provi-
sions and other stores required in the trip altogether it
was an over-crowded interior though neat and orderly
withal

  ray pressed a button as gary sank into the cushions
of one of the divan-like seats there was the whine of
a motor coming up to speed and the engineer gazed in-
quiringly at his friend as a strange feeling crept over
him

  stand up ray commanded with a twinkle in his
eye

  and he laughed boyishly as gary struggled against an
unseen force in the effort to rise to his feet it sesmed
that his weight had grown enormous and he was barely
able to pull himself to an erect position

  what in the world is this he asked in astonishment

  artificial gravity you see when we leave the im-
mediate neighborhood of good old mother earth her at-
traction will become less and less until eventually we
would be floating about unable to control our move-
ments were it not for this feature of the meteor
by its means we can maintain normal gravity when out
in space here on earth your weight is just about


amazing stories

the panorama that spread before their eyes as the meteor sped along at this altitude

                              manipulations was bizarre in the extreme

in response to ray
the explorers of callisto



doubled now i also have a similar apparatus for over-
coming the effects of acceleration and deceleration which
might otherwise prove fatal to our bodily structure

  he cut off the energy and gary sank to his feet with
a sigh of relief

  why thats wonderful ray he said something
new 

  no i have been working on it for years and this is
as far as i have gotten in the effort to discover means of
nullifying our gravity i cant -seem to reverse the
process

  you are using your own fuel in the motor

  yes indeed the new concentrate that shows ninety
thousand btu per pound we have almost enough
aboard to carry us around the world

  but that will only carry us one-tenth of the way to
the moon

  less than that if we used it but the motor will be
used only while we are in the earths atmosphere so we
have far more of the concentrate than we need the
propeller and wings are useless you know out in the
near vacuum of space there is nothing for them to
work on when we leave the atmosphere we shall de-
pend on the rocket tubes-those cylinders surrounding
the nose and tail

  how do they operate

  by the reactive effect of successively fired charges of
parsonite my super-explosive and these tubes may be
swung about in various directions so that we can steer
the vessel and progress in any direction at will they
will also be used in landing on the moons surface if
as is supposed there is little or no atmosphere the wings
and propeller would avail us nothing so we will be com-
pelled to retard the ship by means of properly directed
discharges from the rocket tubes and thus land safely
but suppose there are living beings on the other
side of the moon and that they attack us have you
weapons and means of defense

  absolutely of course we have no means of knowing
what sort of weapons might be used against us but with
a race of beings of great enough intelligence to make use
of the powerful radio signals we picked up it will likely
be some form of destructive ray the hull of the
meteor and the specially cast glass of the windows are
proof against such attack of course if they use projec-
tiles we are out of luck but i hardly consider that likely
we likewise have several forms of destructive rays of
our own flame pistols and a short wave projector that
produces fusing heat in metal objects at a considerable
distance

  how can the flame pistols be used were not going to
leave the meteor when on the moons surface are we
surely how else could we accomplish anything
but how can we leave the ship if there is no atmos-
phere and if the temperature at night is some two hun-
dred degrees below zero as is estimated by astronomers 
dont you know me better than that by this time
ray laughed those things have all been anticipated
well leave through the air locked entrance and return
the same way there are three suits in the rear com-
partment that are air-tight and provided with oxygen
helmets like diving suits woven in the materials of
these suits there are innumerable fine wires that will
pick up short wave energy broadcast from the meteor
and convert it into heat to keep us comfortable in the
lunar cold well have weapons in our belts and every-

thing necessary including miniature radios in the hel-
mets so that we can converse up to a distance of a half
mile

  i give up said gary helplessly there is nothing
you do not think of and i can offer no further ob-
jections when do we go

  can you make it the day after tomorrow 

  sure thing ill return tonight and get things in
shape at home pack my bag and be here at whatever
time you say

  all right then suppose you take the early morning
train and well figure on taking off at noon

  right and how long is the trip going to take 
some ten or eleven hours of course we cant say
how long we might remain there but better figure on
being away no less than a week

  ray chuckled at the expression of amazement that
spread over garys lean features

  ten or eleven hours he gasped how fast does
the meteor travel

  i calculate on a maximum of about fifty thousand
miles an hour we can accelerate gradually to this speed
after leaving our atmosphere then decelerate gradually
with a resulting average of more than half of that speed
gary shook his head slowly seems impossible he
said but ill believe you and will be johnny-on-the-
spot when the time comes

the meteor in space

e appointed time the three adventurers en-
ticed themselves in the center compartment of
meteor the outer hatch being bolted securely
from the inside there were no witnesses in the en-
closed field and mo news of their projected journey had
leaked out to the press or news broadcasters every-
thing was in readiness and eddie dowling mounted the
pilots seat with a grin that spread from ear to ear he
had piloted the ship on a trial the preceding evening and
was so enthused and so anxious to get out of the upper
reaches of the atmosphere that he could scarcely wait
for rays signal to start

  in the view plate of the periscope there appeared the
broad expanse of the field ahead and the high board
fence at the far end beyond which there was a clump
of trees

  think shell clear the woods with this load eddie
asked ray

  sure cleared it a mile last night and there isnt
five hundred pounds extra on board now

  you should know let her go then

  right-o

  eddie yanked the starter lever as if he wished to pull
it from its socket there was a grinding roar up front
then the smooth purr of the motor faster and faster
spun the propeller then he pulled another lever which
released the brakes below them and they started rolling
down the field as the powerful motor picked up speed
under full throttle its exhaust gases being discharged
almost noiselessly to the rear through the long pipes
which hung beneath the streamlined body they sped
more and more swiftly until the tail was up then the
wheels were clear and with a sharp rise that carried them
well over the fence and trees they were off

  the meteor climbed at a steep angle in eddies eager-
ness to gain altitude quickly and in less than five minutes


amazing stories

the altimeter registered twenty thousand feet soon it
showed thirty thousand feet then forty and the speed of
the motor had increased perceptibly while the ship seemed
to be climbing more slowly

  airs getting pretty rare outside ray explained at
garys questioning glance pretty soon the propeller
wont take hold at all and well have to use the rocket
tubes

  it was the day of the new moon and at the angle they
climbed its orb was visible in the periscope screen
they were heading directly for their destination be-
fore long the altimeter needle had reached the end of the
scale and ray placed in operation two instruments of his
own design these were distance and speed indicators
which depended on the earths attraction for their opera-
tion rather than on the barometric pressure as in the
case of the standard altimeter so condensed were the
scales of these instruments at the lower readings that
the needles scarcely flickered with their comparatively
slow speed and nearness to the earth the stick and
rudder-bar wobbled loosely at the touch of eddies hand
and feet the air resistance was approaching zero and
the motor raced alarmingly

  cut the throttle eddie ordered ray and give her
about a ten second burst from the rear rocket tubes

  the motor coughed and died eddie turned to a panel
with a number of buttons arranged like the keys of a
typewriter he pressed five or six of these and there
came a blast of rapid staccato barks from the rear gary
had a sensation of being suddenly thrown through space
with tremendous velocity but this passed immediately as
the acceleration compensating energy responded he
looked through one of the circular windows in the floor
and exclaimed aloud at what he saw the earth which
had but a moment previously been a huge bowl was now
a perfect globe of enormous size that receded rapidly as
he watched he could scarce drag his eyes from the mar-
velous sight but turned quickly at a shout from ray and
eddie the speed indicator registered eight thousand
miles an hour and the needle was moving steadily to the
right over the scale whose highest graduation was at one
hundred thousand miles an hour

  glory be shouted eddie shes even faster than
you figured chief man alive-were traveling

  no wonder said ray drily you had the rockets on
for nearly a half minute

  eddie turned a crestfallen face toward them so i
did he admitted sheepishly good thing the compen-
sators worked so well

  so rapid was the acceleration with no air friction to
retard it that within the hour they had reached a ve-
locity of nearly thirty thousand miles an hour the trip
would be completed much sooner than ray had antici-
pated

  gary watched spellbound as the earth receded and the
moon grew larger and nearer he experienced a curious
feeling of detachment as the great gleaming sphere that
was their world took on a green luminescence that shone
eerily against the blackness of the firmament whose
stars presented the entirely new aspect of glowing bril-
liantly without the accustomed twinkle caused by mo-
tions of an intervening atmosphere ahead and to the
left the sun was a blinding blaze of magnificence shoot-
ing great streamers of flame far into space in every
direction the moon several times larger than it ap-
peared from the earth now showed a bright pencil-line

crescent as the triangle formed by their ship the sun
and the moon grew smaller and the angles slowly altered

  the face of the moon was in shadow but shone with
a fair degree of brightness by light reflected from the
earth but so brilliant was the sun-lit crescent at the
left edge that the face seemed almost wholly dark by
comparison and steadily it drew closer

  their speed had become constant at about thirty-five
thousand miles an hour and ray started experimenting
with the tail rockets he pressed a couple of the con-
trol buttons for an instant and the resulting discharges
swung the needle well over the fifty thousand mark
another touch and it reached seventy they were
traveling at more than a thousand miles a minute and
the interior of the meteor was as comfortable and as
normal as regards temperature air quality and gravity as
if they were flying at ordinary speed and altitude over
the surface of the earth

  guess i was very conservative in my estimates said
ray and i believe i know where i made an error
parsonite you know when it is exploded on erth pro-
duces about four million times its own volume in ex-
panding gases but out here in the vacuum the specific
volume of the gas is vastly greater and that makes a
difference in my calculations of course i considered
the weight of the discharged gases and that does not
change with the lowering in pressure but the greater
volume must have considerable effect since at each ex-
plosion we leave behind a far larger cloud against which
to react this larger cloud while of the same weight
must have considerably greater instantaneous inertia

  exactly what i thought grinned eddie

  oh of course that is a foolish explanation in viola-
tion of the simple law of newton said ray the real
reason for the higher speed is that a higher muzzle ve-
locity is obtained in the rocket tubes due to the expanding
of the gases to a lower pressure

  at any rate gary interjected we are getting there
pretty fast

  he had cast a glance at the instrument board and
noticed that the distance from the earth was now well
over  thousand miles and they were scarcely three
hours out

  yes agreed ray and it will soon he time for a
change in direction

  when they had reached the  thousand mile mark
and the moon appeared as large before them as did the
earth behind ray took the controls he swung a small
lever over the face of a graduated quadrant and pressed
a single button of the rocket-control keyboard there
were a few rapid machine gun-like reports from the
rear and the moons image swung well to the left of the
periscope screen

  well pass it on the shadowed side he stated

  sun and moon were both visible through the circular
windows now and it was not long until the moons disc
bit into the right side of the flaming orb and slowly
started crossing they were producing an eclipse all
their own and it was a vastly different one from those
witnessed on earth the apparent diameter of the moon
was now so immense that it gradually swallowed up the
sun and its long flaming streamers as well when they
were in exact opposition with the two bodies the
meteor was plunged into a baleful green semi-darkness
the sole illumination being by light reflected from the
earth and by that of the earth re-reflected from the sur-
the explorers of callisto



face of the moon the firmament became of ebon
blackness the brilliant points of light that were the
stars and planets contributing but little to the light that
streamed through their circular windows

  then the first wavering tips of the suns great promi-
nences started to appear on the other side and the bril-
liant orb wras soon in full view once more another
twenty minutes and a crescent of brightness appeared
at the moons edge and this widened rapidly as the
meteor dashed through space with its speed still un-
checked the lunar orb was half illuminated and the
distance from earth showed  thousand miles before
ray manipulated the control buttons of the forward
rocket tubes they were passing the moon at a distance
of about five thousand miles and it was of colossal size
in their vision

in the path of a beam of waves

ray pressed fully half the keys on the small
panel putting all the rocket tubes at the nose in
- operation time and again he pressed the same
group for a period of ten or fifteen seconds and at each
pressure there was a responding rat-tat-tat and a momen-
tary sensation of being thrown forward in the ship
the compensators worked beautifully however and they
experienced not the slightest discomfort at the tremend-
ous rate of deceleration in a very short time they had
considerably overshot their destination and the needle
of the speed indicator had dropped well toward zero
ray played the keyboard now like a piano and the
heavens rotated before them as the meteor swung
around in the arc of a huge circle another few
minutes and the sun was almost directly overhead with
the lighted surface of the moon just beneath they
were looking at its other side

  from a position estimated by ray as about two thou-
sand miles above the surface it was quite apparent that
the side they had never seen was mightily different from
the face presented toward the earth there were a
multitude of the familiar craters several of these being
even larger than ptolmey and copernicus but the
greater portion of the surface which now hid the earth
from view was occupied by huge areas resembling the
mare serenitatis and the mare tranquilitatis but of
prodigious extent and deeply depressed rather than pre-
senting comparatively level surfaces thus more deserving
of being termed seas from the close range the craters
seemed quite likely to have been formed by the impact of
meteorites when the moon was in a plastic state as sug-
gested by gilbert an intricate network of rays and rills
interconnected the numerous craters and the seas the
rays gleaming with the blue-white color of polished
cobalt and the rills revealing themselves as lengthy chasms
and cracks of unspeakable depth the visitors were on
their knees observing through the floor windows this
marvel of creation never before seen by earthly eyes

  a touch of a button had headed the meteor in the
same direction followed by the moon in its orbit and they
now seemed to be hanging motionless above its surface
actually they were traveling in space at the same speed
and over the same course as the earths satellite

its a wonderful sight boys said gary solemnly

  marvelous agreed ray

  you said something came from eddie

  ray fussed with the small levers that swrung the

rocket tubes out radially from the hull he pressed two
of the control keys and there came a few sharp raps from
overhead both forward and to the rear the moon
seemed to leap upward to meet them and ray manipu-
lated various other buttons rapidly by alternating be-
tween upper and lower tubes he soon maneuvered the
vessel to within ten or fifteen miles of the surface

  the panorama that spread before their eyes as the
meteor sped along at this altitude in response to rays
further manipulations was bizarre in the extreme
they crossed a crater of fully  miles diameter and
whose depth was no less than five miles in the exact
center of this crater there rose a slender spire of deep
green hue that reached a height of probably six or seven
miles above the craters bottom a lofty mountain
range loomed ahead as they crossed the far rim of the
crater-perpendicular peaks lifted their pointed finials to
unconscionable altitudes

  eddie busied himself with the mechanism of a camera
which was set flush with the floor its lens mounted out-
side on the bottom of the hull the shutter clicked in-
cessantly as he replaced roll after roll of exposed film
with fresh ray kept constant watch of his instruments
and occasionally fired a light rocket charge below to
maintain their altitude and direction of travel garys
optics were working overtime as they dropped to two
thousand feet

  the manometer showed no atmospheric pressure out-
side the ship and the stopping of the heat generators and
starting of the refrigerating motors caused ray to glance
at the thermometer that recorded outside temperature
it was near the boiling point

it is just about noon of the long lunar day said ray
then there are about fourteen of our days to pass be-
fore there will be darkness at this point  inquired gary

  thats right and its going to be good and hot out
there in the sun as long as were near the surface
probably be quite a bit cooler in shadow though and
when we leave the ship well have to keep to the
shadows to keep from boiling

  are there no means of cooling the air-tight suits
none but that doesnt worry me if we cant live
in the direct rays of the sun neither can the other fellow
well find them in deep shade

  where are you going to find any shadows with the
sun almost directly overhead 

  in the larger rills at great depth or possibly under
overhanging ledges at the shores of the great seas
they now followed a ledge that shone beneath them
like a vein of pure silver they were to discover later
that it was nearly unadulterated cobalt this ledge led
them through an almost level valley fringed on both
sides by the greenish spires whose material proved sub-
sequently to be nephrite

  after an hour of travel in this manner they came to
the immense bowl that was the largest of the seas they
had observed from far above it was an enormous de-
pression and as they crossed the near rim it seemed
they had come to the edge of the moon for the great bar-
ren concavity was as deep as fifty miles or more in spots
within their range of vision a steep overhanging
precipice marked its rim and they skirted this at moder-
ate speed examining the streaked wall carefully for
signs of life

  ray tuned in the radio to the wave-length on which
they had received the messages back there in new york


amazing stories

he dapped the phones to his ears and listened intently
there were no signals but a continual musical hum of
perhaps a hundred cycles frequency assailed his ear-
drums this rose and fell in volume like a fading sig-
nal but he had no way of determining from whence it
came

  for two hours more they skirted the multi-colored
precipice slowing down occasionally to peer closely at
strange formations that had from a greater distance re-
sembled human dwellings but there was still no sign
of life

  eddie had taken numerous photographs and he desisted
from the work as the sameness of the view became all
too apparent

  well have lots of evidence when we get back
chief he smiled

  yes and well need it if we find no more than we
have found so far in the way of a lunar radio trans-
mitter wonder where the devil it is

  noting that it was nearing midnight by earth time he
replaced the headphones of the radio

  hums gone now he muttered

  then he and the two other passengers were electrified
by the shrill penetrating note of continuous wave code
signals that came in so loudly as to be heard throughout
the compartment ray hastily removed the phones to
save his ear-drums

  boy they must be close he exclaimed either
that or it is an extremely powerful transmitter which of
course it must be if it was used to communicate with
one of the other planets

  look shouted gary suddenly from his position at
one of the windows there it is ahead there to the
left

  his companions peered in the direction indicated and
at the top of the cliff not a mile ahead they saw large
fan-shaped structures topping two tall metal towers the
strands of this odd antenna reflected the suns unob-
structed rays with the unmistakable reddish hue of cop-
per wires or tubing

  no wonder it nearly knocked my ears off said ray
turning off the current that fed the tubes of the radio

  he nosed the ship downward with a few carefully
directed shots from the tubes and they dove into the
shadow of the cliff at first the darkness seemed to be
intense but there was really a considerable amount of re-
flected light from the neighboring sun-lit surfaces of
the arid sea bottom as their eyes became used to the
sudden change from the brilliance of the lunar mid-day
to the twilight of this shaded region they made out a
strange village ahead it looked like the tank farm of
an oil refinery back home fully forty large metallic
cylinders reared themselves from the level bottom at the
base of the cliffs and these were of unmistakably human
design and construction as they drew nearer they
made out the forms of several bipeds who moved in and
out between the habitations walking erect in the same
manner as humans of the earth

  the first sign of life

the pursuing lunarians

it was necessary to fire an occasional light rocket
charge and in each case the luminous gases of the
explosion lighted the shaded area like a flash of
lightning it was thus but a short time until their pres-

ence was revealed to the lunar inhabitants a great
many of these tumbled from the doors of the circular
dwellings and they milled about and gesticulated ex-
citedly over the unexpected appearance of the strange
ship

  on closer view it was seen that these beings were
accoutered in garments very similar to those that reposed
in the lockers of the rear compartment of the meteor
the suits also of pliable material bulged ludicrously in
the vacuum under pressure of the air from within and
each figure was topped by an egg-shaped helmet of shiny
metal

  it was difficult to maintain the position of the meteor
without traveling at considerable speed for the craft
bobbed about uncertainly under the influence of succes-
sive charges fired from the tubes ray decided to make
a landing and he maneuvered the vessel to a point about
a mile from the village and there dropped to the surface
at their contact there arose a cloud of gray powder that
cut off their view for several minutes with the subse-
quent raising of the cloud they saw that a group of the
lunarians were approaching them with great speed
progressed in leaps that carried them thirty or forty
feet at each jump evidently they hailed from another
body in the solar system-a body whose gravity was
nearly equivalent to that of the earth assuming the
physical strength of these beings to be about equal to
that of the tellurians

  when the more curious of the beings had approached
within a hundred feet of the meteor they formed a
semicircle and it was seen at once that each of the
members of the party carried a slender rod of about four
feet length these rods being equipped with bulbous pro-
tuberances and presenting the appearance of weapons
like a company of well-trained soldiers they raised the
peculiar small arms and directed them at the meteor

  hope our insulating envelope holds out remarked
ray those are quite evidently ray projectors of some
sort

  at his words there came a blinding flare from each
of the rods and their bodies were subjected to a stinging
prickling sensation that betokened a heavily charged at-
mosphere within the vessel the light flashes that con-
verged on the outer surface of the staunch craft seemed
to have no other effect and eddie whooped with glee
when they saw that the lunarians were mystified at the
failure of their attack

  there came another burst of the blinding flashes after
a moment and the meteor lurched and tilted at an
alarming angle as one of the rays took effect on the
landing gear

  say exclaimed ray this will never do sup-
pose they shoot away our wings and landing gear en-
tirely well have some trouble in landing when we
return to earth im going to try the short waves on
them

  he advanced to a powerful high-frequency transmit-
ter and started its motor generator the tubes glowed
instant response and ray swung a lever on the panel of
the transmitter slowly from left to right watching the
enemy meanwhile

  just warming them up a bit he explained to gary
watch

  that little transmitter by conduction through the
ether was inducing high-frequency currents of nearly a
million alternations per second in the bodies of the
the explorers of callisto



his companions
peered in the di-
rection indicated
and at the top of
the cliffs not a mile ahead they saw
large fan-shaped structures topping two
tall metal towers

lunarians soon their bodily temperature
would begin to rise and it would not be
long until they were all laid low with
raging fevers and racing pulses ray did
not wish to kill any of them unless it wras
necessary in self defense

  one of the lunarians sank slowly to his
knees then rolled forward and lay prone
others of them moved about in a be-


amazing

stories

wildered manner as if searching for the cause of their
sudden illness another dropped then two more and
in less time than it takes to tell they lay helpless in the
heavy dust

  now said ray well go out and look them over
our own suits are insulated against these vibrations

  hastily they donned the heavy suits and globular hel-
mets ray showed gary how to adjust the oxygen ap-
paratus and how to operate the various instruments that
hung from the outside belt one of these was the flame
pistol with which gary was already slightly familiar
they entered the air lock and bolted the inner hatch
then eddie unbolted the outer hatch and they plainly
heard the hiss of the escaping air

  eddie was first to drop into the thick powder that
carpeted the ground and he took the first experimental
step tumbling into a ludicrous heap as he lost his bal-
ance in the eight-foot spring that resulted from his slight
effort it would require a little time for them to become
accustomed to moving about in a gravity field only one-
sixth as strong as their own

  they shuffled through the powdery footing until they
reached the outstretched lunarians gary kneeled over
one of the prostrate forms and peered through the single
window of his helmet he recoiled at the look of hate
that flashed through from the bloodshot eyes of the help-
less being but the fevered face that looked out at him
was unmistakably human with the exception of the
slightly purpled skin that was probably caused by the
artificially produced fever this man might have been one
of the millions that inhabited his home city on earth
the phones in his helmet spoke loudly and he gazed up
startled at the voice of ray that seemed to come from
so close by he was astonished at seeing the ballooned
figure of his friend fully a hundred feet from him thfcn
he remembered the helmet radios

  gary came the voice these people are just like our
own in features and in stature

  yes it seems incredible

  a sharp cry in eddies voice startled them both and
they were still further astonished when they looked in
the direction pointed to by his bloated outstretched arm
in its bulging enclosure

  about five hundred yards away out of reach of the
vibrations from the meteor that still charged the
ether five of the lunarians were chasing a sixth figure-
one of their own kind from the smaller stature and
shorter leaps of the fugitive they deduced that it was
a woman and when this one stumbled falling heavily in
the dust and burying the huge helmet in folded arms
they felt more than certain

  at that moment the pursuers caught sight of the
round-helmeted strangers the strange ship and the
prostrate forms of their own kind they stopped short
and two of them raised rods similar to those carried by
the helpless victims at their feet eddie was nearest in
line and the two flashes from the raised weapons con-
verged in his direction instinctively he dodged and
the impetus of his movement threw him fifteen feet
from the line of fire in a rage he grasped the flame
pistol that depended from his belt and trained it on the
lunarians there was a brilliant spurt of scarlet and
one of the attackers was consumed in the angry flame
that struck him full in the chest before the other could
again bring his own weapon into play he too fell a victim
to the angry eddie the oxygen in their own suits

made brilliant torches of the two lunarians as the deadly
flame got in its work the other three were unarmed
and they fled precipitately in the direction of the vil-
lage leaving the erstwhile fugitive still cowering in the
dust

  the three tellurians advanced to the crumpled figure
which shrank from them as they drew near eddie
placed his helmet close to the larger egg-shaped one and
looked through the two intervening windows

  christopher he exclaimed its a girl and a
peach

  by pantomime they convinced her they would not
harm her and eventually got her to her feet and indi-
cated their desire to take her within their vessel after
a considerable amount of gesturing and nodding and
bowing on both sides she finally accompanied them will-
ingly and they noticed that she shrank in alarm from
the prostrate figures of her compatriots

  in a few minutes they were all four in the air-locked
entrance of the meteor and when eddie had bolted the
outer hatch they heard the welcome hiss of air entering
the chamber from the pumps in the rear compartment
no sooner were they within when the girl tore her helmet
from her head and threw it to the floor

  they fell back amazed at the wild beauty that con-
fronted them

communicating by pictures

the torrent of speech that assailed their ears might
well have been a paean of praise so softly and
smoothly did the unfamiliar syllables of her
euphonic language roll from her tongue but the fire
that glinted in the wondrous brown eyes and the gestures
with which she supplemented the unintelligible disser-
tation told them she was berating her recent pursuers
with their helmets in hand the three men listened
politely but with expressions of such bewildered inde-
termination that the girl broke off and stared from one
to the other for a moment then she burst into laughter
-peal after peal of contagious merriment rang through
the narrow confines of the meteor the ice was
broken

  indicating her own person with a sweeping gesture
and a bow the girl uttered a single word lola

  gary completed the introduction by naming his two
friends and himself the three derived much amuse-
ment from her efforts at reproducing his pronunciation
of eddie and gary with the single syllable ray she
had no difficulty

  the men removed their cumbersome suits and she
proceeded to do likewise when she was revealed in a
snugly fitting silver-hued garment that would have
created a furore on one of their bathing beaches at
home they exchanged embarrassed glances but the girl
seemed entirely at ease and unabashed

  it was soon evident that lola was an extremely in-
telligent girl for she immediately realized that explana-
tions could be made only by signs and drawings she
pointed to a wall chart of the earth and nodded brightly
to show that she knew what it represented by going
through the motions of sketching she indicated that she
desired to be supplied with drawing materials and she
exclaimed delightedly when ray handed her a pad of
paper and a pencil she examined both as if they were
somewhat strange to her but after experimenting with
the explorers of callisto



the pencil a bit she started drawing a series of concentric
circles on the paper in the center she drew a small
circle which she speedily shaded to represent a sphere
then on each of the concentric circles she placed another
sphere of smaller size

  by george exclaimed ray shes drawing the
solar system

  this was confirmed at once by lola who pointed again
to the wall chart then to the sphere on the third con-
centric circle she had drawn

  tora she averred confidently then hesitatingly
ray ed-dee gair-ree-meer tora

  she knows we are from the earth gasped ray and
her name for our planet is tora

  lola then pointed to the sphere on her fifth concentric
circle and rapidly marked nine small dots at varying
distances from this globe

  the nine satellites of jupiter exclaimed ray

  she pointed to the fifth dot from the sphere then to
herself intoning solemnly lola-meer thares

  callisto said ray the satellite of more than three
thousand miles diameter whose distance from jupiter is
one and a third million miles the girl is from callisto
or thares as she calls it

  but objected gary she seems to be at home in our
earth gravity as simulated in the meteor-she was able
to leap twenty or more feet on the moons surface how
can that be if the satellite she hails from is so much
smaller than our earth

  the smaller body might still have a similar surface
gravity ray explained since the kinship of gravity
and magnetism was proved our older estimates based
on the mass of a body have been thrown into the discard
in many instances it may well be that this satellite has
a gravity equivalent to our own

  seeing that her efforts were bringing understanding
she tore the first sheet from the pad and started sketch-
ing on the second sheet this girl from the distant
satellite was an artist by the use of a very few strokes
she was able to produce wonderful likenesses of human
beings machines buildings she first drew a king seated
on a throne then his consort a beautiful woman at
their feet she drew a child-a girl of perhaps ten years
of age whom she called lola their visitor was a prin-
cess  she studied their faces and beheld astonished com-
prehension then she drew even more rapidly using
sheet after sheet of the paper as she warmed to the
task her sketches formed a picture history of her own
life and of the peoples of her own world she pictured
scientific advances made by two separate and distinct
races of beings the one clan being dark-haired like her-
self the other seemingly of larger stature and extremely
blond the overthrow of the government and the as-
sassination of her parents she wept over the plans of
the light-haired ones she pictured vividly showing that
their astronomers were cognizant of the desirability of
the earth as a field for conquest she sketched space-
ships of huge size with which the journey was to be made
and indicated the plans for using the earths satellite as a
near-by base for hostile operations her own kidnaping
by the leader of the warlike blond horde she stormed
over finallyending the story with her escape and subse-
quent release from her tormentors by the earth men

  when she had finished she turned a happy face to
the three men who had watched so silently and ad-
miringly

  well ill be hornswoggled said eddie theres
the whole story for us these doggoned calisthenics or
whatever you want to call them are figuring on busting
us up back home can you beat that for nerve 

  ray and gary grinned at his explosive remarks and
the silvery laugh of lola once more brightened the in-
terior of the meteor when she observed the comical
expression of consternation that spread over the chubby
face of the mechanic

  all the same said ray this is a serious matter and
i am going to try and learn more from lola though i
am afraid my own efforts at picture-writing will not be
as successful meanwhile i think we should repair the
landing gear and disarm the helpless callistonians out-
side before we release them

  right chief said eddie ill get out the welding
outfit and take care of it right away

  he soon had the apparatus ready and again drew on
his air-tight suit before he clamped the helmet in
place he cast an admiring look at the sleek blackness of
lolas close-cropped tresses where she bent over rays
initial attempt at imitating her method of communicating
by means of pictures

  but rays efforts proved successful due to the keen
perception of the girl and to occasional help from gary
they learned that the lunar base had been in existence
only a short time less than one revolution of the earth
about the sun lolas eyes glowed at the pictures of
peace prosperity and happiness on earth that ray did his
best to represent she signified her joy at being within
the meteor and her wish to return to the earth with
them it developed that nearly two years were to be
required in which to complete the fleet of space ships and
to establish the lunar base of operations ray indicated
his intention of returning to the earth and preparing its
peoples for the warfare to come even suggesting the
possibility of building a fleet of their own to visit first
the moon then the satellite callisto destroying the base
and then carrying the war to her own world with the
express intention of overthrowing the power of the light-
haired ones and restoring lolas own loved ones to their
birthright of freedom and happiness his proposals met
enthusiastic approval and by the time eddie returned
with an armful of the enemys ray projectors a complete
understanding had been reached

  all fixed chief said eddie when he had removed
his helmet and pushed the slender weapons under one of
the bunks the wheel was not damaged neither was
the axle they had only burnt off one of the struts and
that was easy its as good as new now

  fine and now well release those poor devils out
there

  he pulled the switch that controlled the energy used
to overcome them lola did not realize the meaning of
this action but when the men glued their eyes to the
windows and watched the prostrate figures of the ene-
mies she knew that the strange instrument in the
meteor had something to do with their condition
when one of them commenced moving about and even-
tually sat upright she registered a vigorous protest and
there was no misunderstanding the warning note in her
voice though the words were unintelligible she has-
tened to employ the sketch pad once more but before she
was able to bring her talent to further use there came a
surprised cry from eddie

  holy smoke he exclaimed here comes a tank


amazing stories

  an armored caterpillar tractor was bearing down on
them from the direction of the village and most of the
recently helpless callistonians were now  their feet
and hailing the approaching war machine with joyful
leaps and wavings of the arms as the monster engine
neared them a ray of shimmering yellow shot forth
from its fore part and impinged on the hull of the
meteor

  lola screamed as the vessel was surrounded by im-
penetrable darkness but ray reassured her smilingly
he was confident of the efficacy of the meteors in-
sulating envelope but he decided to get out of range of
the ray on account of the possibility of it causing damage
to the outer structure so he advanced to the rocket con-
trol keyboard and pressed a few of the buttons

  there was no response and the temperature in the
meteor was rising rapidly

a callistonian sphere

hat sort of a bombardment is this asked
ray in astonishment these must be vibra-
tions of a sort i have never encountered our
electrical system is paralyzed

  he worked frantically with the keys but to no avail
the darkness persisted and the temperature continued
to rise though the refrigerating system was working to
capacity he pondered for a moment as gary and
eddie attempted to calm the now greatly perturbed lola
she was endeavoring to convey a message to them but
in the excitement of the moment was unable to do so

  i have it ray suddenly shouted quick eddie-
the emergency lights well fire the rockets with their
batteries

  they hastily dismantled the battery boxes of two of
the equipments that had been included in the accoutre-
ments of the meteor on the chance of exploring dark
caverns during the visit they soon had two sets of
powerful dry cells and quickly set about tearing at the
moulding in which were hidden the ignition wires of the
rocket tubes perspiration poured from their skin as the
heat increased but they worked with unabated energy
finally the proper wires were located and small sections
of insulation were stripped from the copper

  now breathed ray when i give the word make
contact with the battery terminals just two short taps
on the binding posts ready

  ready chief panted eddie

  lola and gary had sunk to their seats gasping pain-
fully in the superheated atmosphere

  now said ray whose throat was so dry he could
scarcely speak

  there were a number of answering raps from below
and the two men collapsed where they crouched the
meteor sped from its position with tremendous
velocity and was instantly in the glare of the sun bril-
liant beams of its light streamed through the circular
windows as the vessel rose far from the moons surface
but there were none to observe the cheering sight lola
and the three men had lost consciousness but the pumps
in the rear compartment continued their whirring and
the temperature dropped rapidly luckily the refrig-
erating system was operated from tanks of compressed
air and had not ceased functioning when the electrical
system was paralyzed by the baleful ray of the callis-
tonians

  eddie was first to recover and he stared about him
wonderingly as he sat up for a minute he ruminated
dazedly then he remembered and quickly sprang to his
feet

  oh boy he drawled was that a close one an-
other minute and the meteor would have been a fine
cemetery

  he rushed to the side of lola and rubbed her wrists
frantically so marble-white was her skin that he feared
she was dead but he soon whooped his relief as her
eyelids fluttered and she drew a long tremulous breath
ray and gary recovered at about the same time

  well said ray when he was able to speak that
was one i didnt count on and we got out just in time-
no question of that

  he looked through the lower windows and observed
that they were fully five hundred miles from the moon

  but we have a ray of our own he continued grimly
and im going back and ill give them a dose of their
own medicine

  an experimental touch on the keyboard showed that
the connections were once more functioning he pressed
several of the keys and they dropped rapidly as the rat-tat
of the rocket charges answered lola objected stren-
uously as she saw the ill-omened satellite rushing upward
to meet them she wanted never to return to the place
of her most recent sufferings but eddies good-natured
smile and assured manner soon reconciled her

  the meteor dropped to within a few hundred feet
of its recent position and they were astonished to see that
the war machine of the callistonians had been overturned
by the blast from their own rocket tubes eddie loaded
the camera and made a few more exposures

  half buried in the powdery footing there were the
bodies of a number of the helmeted callistonians who
had been slain in the sudden hurricane resulting from
the escape of the meteor the state of collapse of
their garments told of the reason for their passing
the force of the concussion had torn the air-tight cover-
ings allowing the oxygen to escape from within and thus
suffocating the victims not an enemy wa in sight and
ray headed for their village again he was warned by
lola but he circled the settlement looking for signs of
life the girl was extremely nervous and they had not
long to wait for the reason for her fear from a number
of the cylindrical structures there shot forth duplicates
of the ray that had nearly proved their undoing but
the meteor darted hither and thither as ray manipu-
lated the control keys and it was impossible for the
enemy to keep them in range for a long enough time to
produce any effect

  then there came a surprise for the meteor halted
in her rapid movements and was drawn upward by a
new and irresistible force at a quick glance through
one of the top windows lola cried out in fresh alarm
she had indicated that none of the space ships from
callisto were on the earths satillite but one had evi-
dently returned in time to witness the maneuverings of
the meteor for high above them hovered a gigantic
sphere of polished metal from which depended two large
discs like the electromagnets used in the electric cranes
on earth from these it was apparent the force ema-
nated which was drawing them helplessly aloft

  fne kettle of fish yelped eddie what to do

  well try the high-frequency beam on them replied
ray leaving the controls
the explorers of callisto



  lola sat quietly by an expression of resigned expecta-
tion of calamity on her beautiful features

  they started the generators as the rapidity of rise
increased and soon the powerful vibrations of the fusing
beam were searching the vitals of the great sphere above
them but there was no immediate result and in less
than a minute they were thrown to the floor by the heavy
jar of striking against the metal discs they were firmly
attached and the discs immediately commenced drawing
upward as the cables attached to them were reeled in
from above they were to be brought very close for
destruction

   lola hid her face in despair

   cant seem to find a vital spot grunted ray or else
the ship is insulated as we are but we should be able
to fuse away some of the outer covering

  he continued the exploring as a party of helmeted
callistonians dropped from a hatch to the upper surface
of the meteor their clumsy metal shoes produced a
noisy tattoo as they moved about with a heavy piece of
machinery which they set up amidships of the top sur-
face of the hull

  they are about to drill through groaned gary

  dont worry said ray well stop that

  he started the other transmitter and the vibrations
which had overcome the attackers on the surface were at
work above still he continued with the searching mo-
tion of the fusing beam the sounds above were stilled
and they soon heard a body fall to the curved surface
then another and another two of the stricken callis-
tonians slid past a window and slithered over the side to
fall to their death in the village far underneath then
one of the attracting discs let go and the meteor
dropped to an almost perpendicular position throwing
the occupants into a heap against the front partition

  got one of their generators exulted ray crawling
back to his beam controls now for the other

  yes and all those birds that were  top are gone
gloated eddie

  but the weaving beam failed to produce results and 
ray finally concentrated it on a protuberance of the im-
mense vessel to which they were attached there was
an almost immediate effect a small opening fusing
through the metal and quickly spreading until a large
section of the protuberance had melted and dripped into
the depths beneath there came a quick jerk and
the moons surface receded rapidly as the pilot of the
enemy vessel attempted a retreat not thinking to cast off
the barnacle that was causing the damage and the
unwieldy sphere was speedy for they were soon at a
tremendous distance from the previous position a
gaping hole now appeared where the protuberance had
existed and the occupants of the meteor knew that the
air was escaping from the monstrous vessel above

  then there wras another jerk and the motion of the
larger vessel changed to a wobbly reeling progression
that betokened disaster apparently its crew had been
suffocated and the machinery was out of control the
meteor was doomed to go hurtling through space an
unwilling dangler from the unpiloted vagabond of space

  ray tried a terrific rocket blast without effect the
energy that had trapped them was too powerful to be
thus overcome then he experimented with various keys
and the direction levers until with a continuous blast
from a single tube he had swung the meteor about
until it lay alongside the spherical hull of the larger ship

and he could obtain a view of the supports and feeders of
the attracting disc the fusing beam was then concen-
trated on the cable fastenings and in a moment they were
free the meteor roaring away from the wandering
sphere under the impulses from the single rocket

  thats that said ray wiping the perspiration from
his brow i think we had better start for home now
before something else happens

  you said something agreed eddie enthusiastically
lola trilled her happiness when their intentions were
made known to her and gary was far from sorry

the meteor plans a return

with the shadowed side of the moon behind
them and the shining greenish orb that was the
earth ahead gary conversed seriously with
ray who was at the controls

   i fear this presages a fearful conflict he said the
radio of the callistonians has probably advised their
home body of the happenings of the past few hours
should we not have destroyed their lunar headquarters
probably but i hated to do it in cold blood besides
we can always return in a few hours and i had rather
have authority from the government to proceed before
engaging in such wholesale slaughter when we have
presented our evidence and have told our story there
must be a conference of the nations immediate steps
must be taken to prepare adequate defense possibly an
expedition should be sent to callisto to fight the war
there as we suggested to lola

  it would save our earth much damage and suffering
if we are able to prepare in time but with the procras-
tination and dallying usually indulged in when interna-
tional questions are under dispute i have little hopes of
speedy results being obtained do you think our story
will be taken seriously

  they must believe us we have supplemented the
evidence of the radio messages with an elaborate series
of photographs these should prove conclusive

  gary frowned dubiously but the war itself he
said will be an extremely formidable undertaking
how do you think it would be handled most advan-
tageously

  my proposal will be to construct a fleet of ships simi-
lar to the meteor but of considerably larger size and
equipped with more powerful weapons of offense our
fusing ray was of insufficient potency but it will be a
simple matter to construct similar apparatus of many
times the strength of ours i will recommend that no
less than a hundred of these vessels be built some in our
own country and some in the workshops of france
germany england and the other nations by dividing
the job in this manner it should be possible to have all
available in six months or so provided work can be
started at once with such a fleet properly manned a
very short period of training will suffice and if the
enemy have not anticipated us the armada can set out
for callisto stopping en route to destroy the lunar base
of operations

  sounds reasonable ray i have an idea also that
we may be able to decode the callistonian radio mes-
sages with the help of lola with that brain of hers she
should be able to pick up our language very quickly and
even if she is not familiar with their dot-and-dash code
she will be able to teach her own language to some of

 hermopheles jones
was working at a low-

       s a result of being rather intoxicated john reis-
wick left the elevator at the twentieth instead
of the thirtieth floor of the new astor house
immaculately dressed drunk enough to be
rather dignified and at the same time sober
enough to keep quiet he had started to attend a banquet
given in honor of the football team of columbia uni-
versity of the year  this affair was being held just
ten floors above the one in which the american philo-
sophical society was holding its annual meeting

  reiswick looked as much like a member of the ameri-
can philosophical society as like an old football star
of columbia consequently when he left the elevator at
the twentieth floor instead of the one ten stories above
obsequious waiters ushered him into the banquet hall
vhere he spent an hour
of dreary eating in the
company of two hundred
real members of the so-
ciety no one was certain
of his identity and so it
was thought best not to
take a chance of offending
a distinguished guest who
was for the time being
apparently lost in deep
thought for this reason
he had been placed in an
advantageous position near
the speakers table as
much as his condition
would permit he gave se-
rious attention to the pro-
gramme though the first
lfew papers read made him
wonder when the hip-hip-
hurrah and the usual jolli-
fication would begin

 he really did not
understand much of what was said and it was not till
the last speaker was introduced that he heard anything
of interest this member of the society was a sociologist
of note and the theme of his address was the gradual
lowering of the birthrate in america for some un-
known reason the wromen of america were becoming
sterile birth control companionate marriage feminine
independence the high cost of living the diminution in
the size of the average home could be considered as play-
ing some part in this lowered birthrate it was believed
however that none of these factors really reached the root
of the trouble and that unless the real reason was found
for the rapid drop in the number of births and steps
taken to correct it the american people would soon fall
from its commanding place as a leader of nations

  there are not enough babies being born the speaker
said emphatically in fact and here he tried to
alleviate the seriousness of the situation by speaking in a
lighter vein in fact unless something is done soon it
may easily be that twenty years from now there will no
longer be a football team at columbia university

  john reiswick had a one-track mind that was
what made him such a football star in the old days and
the same trait had enabled him to become many times a
millionaire in the ten years following his graduation
during these years his great love had been the football
team of columbia and its supremacy over all other teams
he spent money as an alumnus as freely as he had spent

his muscles prior to graduation he worked at making
money but he spent all his spare time increasing the
glory of columbia naturally the part of the speech that
seemed to impress him the most was that statement
twenty years from now there will no longer be a foot-
ball team at columbia university

  he remained quiet till the end of the programme and
then made a beeline for the sociologist he simply asked
for one thing--the mans card in his alcoholic state
he could not do any logical thinking but he did know
that this man had made a statement that required in-
vestigation and he also knew that the next morning he
would have a clear head with the card in his pocket he
left the banquet hall as dignified and as drunk as when
he entered it but in that head of his was the one idea

  the morning came and
with it sobriety a shower
bath and hot coffee put
him in excellent shape for
a days work his valet
who had as usual gone
through his pockets re-
spectfully called his atten-
tion to a visiting card the
rich man had brought home
with him at once reis-
wick recalled the entire af-
fair and with the direct-
ness that had made him a
rich man he phoned to
the office that he would not
be there till late and
started out on his search
for the speaker who had
made such a disturbing
statement

  dr stanfield was an-
noyed at being roused
from a sound sleep by a
total stranger he refused to see the man this attitude
did not last long the stranger was insistent-the
stranger was worse than that-he had stated bluntly that
he was simply going to stay there till he saw the doctor
and that no one was going to make him leave realizing
under the circumstances that it would be better to get rid
of him by seeing him dr stanfield sighed and wearily
dressed to go down stairs once down there and finding
who the visitor was he thawed considerably he even
told reiswick that he was glad to see him and asked him
to breakfast reiswick accepted the invitation and lost
no time in giving the reason for the early visit

  what i want to know is simply this you said last
night that in twenty years there would be no more foot-
ball at columbia why

he professor frowned

  that was rather a wild statement of mine what
i wanted to do was to impress upon the philosophical
society the danger of the rapidly falling birthrate
there are thousands of women in the united states today
who are sterile and apparently no scientist has so far
been able to discover the reason most of these women
want children and cannot have them so serious is the
situation that the lawyers of the country have at least
been talking about the wisdom of passing a national
divorce act which would allow an easy separation in such
cases of sterility you see this lowered birthrate

tthere is the ever-increasing me-
y chanical treatment of family life
going to lead ns the voluntary decrease
in the birthrate the standardization of life
the trend of modern foods-all must inev-
itably have a definite effect on the human
being it seems to us that this story must
be of especial interest to women though it

amazing stories

threatens the very fabric of our national life our
social security is based on the continuance of the family
our wealth has to descend from father to son the men
of wealth feel that they have failed in life if they have
no son to inherit their estate if the lowering of the
birthrate continues for another twenty-five years as it
has for the last five the situation will become serious
in fact it is almost serious now if this is true you can
figure for yourself where the university will get its foot-
ball stars in another twenty years as i understand it
many of the stars are from the families of the rich it
seems that these are the families that are being largely
affected the very poor seem to be having some chil-
dren but even they are not as prolific as they were and
of course their children do not as a rule go to our
colleges and universities

  reiswick shook his head rather mournfully as he
murmured

  no more football something must be done

  no doubt something will be done some one will
find the reason and with the discovery will come the cure
are you a married man no then you are in a se-
rious condition if you do marry you are simply playing
with fate you will probably die without ever having a
child you can call your own

  you dont really mean that

  i really do you have been so occupied with foot-
ball and business that you do not realize the concern with
which the new york upper set is looking at this matter
i have personally interviewed over one hundred phy-
sicians who take care of the best people in this city and
they tell me that a large part of their worry is the sterility
of their patients so far they have been unable to do
anything their patients seem to be in perfect health
but there are no children

  but there must be some way of solving this difficulty
we have to have men to keep up football at columbia
and now that i think of it i ought to have a child i
am a rich man and i should have a family

  i agree with you but if you marry the odds are
against you that was what i was talking about last
night and as far as i can see the matter is growing
worse all the time

  i shall have to think this over said reiswick finally
as he drank the last of his coffee send me a bill for
this consultation and i will see that you get a check at
once i am going to see you again this is very inter-
esting to me and i am going to see what can be done
about it it may sound conceited but up to this time i
have never failed to get a thing i started for and i
feel that i am going to get this

  as soon as reiswick reached his private office he sent
for his secretary

  bill sit down i want to talk to you how many
young men in the office 

  exactly one hundred and fifty-seven

  how many are married 

  as far as i know about fifty per cent

  how many of them have had children this last year
  just one

  you dont mean just one

  that is all and that is rather a peculiar case
young smithson in the shipping department you re-
member that you sent him to burmah about two years
ago  he married out there and while he swears the little
lady is a pure aryan she seems a little dark though she
certainly is pretty i have seen her once or twice when

she called at the office for her husband they live over
in brooklyn and they have a baby three months old
you were busy coaching the team when the child was
born and so when the boys made up a present for them
i just put in fifty dollars for you and i never did think
of telling you it surely was of no importance

  but it was send for smithson i want to go right
out there and see that baby no time to spend tell
him i will be waiting for him in my auto out at the curb
how about the letters sir

  you sign them for me this is something far more
important than the mail i am up against the biggest
problem in my life and there is no time to be lost do
you know that i am thirty-three years old i never
realized the danger till now you look after things while
i am gone tell smithson to hustle i want to see that
baby

a few minutes later reiswick and smithson were in
the automobile threading their way to brooklyn
the young shipping clerk was naturally excited he
wanted to ask a dozen questions but realized that the
best thing to do was to keep quiet till he found out what
his employer wanted finally reiswick asked

  why didnt you tell me that you had a baby

  i did not know that you would be interested

  not interested do you realize that i am more inter-
ested in babies now than i am in anything else in the
world i do not know when i was so interested in
anything how does it feel to be a father

  it really is wonderful replied the young man smil-
ing you see there are not so many babies in our
neighborhood and it has brought us into a lot of social
prominence lots of really fine people have called to see
the baby and asked us to come and eat a meal with them
and bring the baby several men have offered to buy the
little one for as much as a hundred thousand but of
course we would not sell her for any amount i think
that she knows me already and she is the most fun when
she is taking her bath i only have a chance to play with
her at night and on sundays you see we are not rich
enough to have a nurse and servants and so i help the
wife a good deal she does all her own cooking knows
how to make a lot of eastern dishes that are really very
fine and not expensive either are you making this trip
just to see a baby sir

  just to see the baby smithson and that is all i
wanted to see a real baby and the first one i was able to
locate wtas yours as you say babies are scarce it has
been a long time since i actually saw a baby in fact i
do not remember when i saw a baby-real close so i
wanted to see one

  well if you want to see a real baby you will have a
chance when you see susanne takes after her mother
some but has my eyes and a funny little twisted smile
my wife says that she saw that smile wthen the baby wtas
only a few days old but then you know all mothers are
foolish over their babies that way thinking they look
like the father at least that is what i have read in the
old books

  in another hour mr and mrs smithson john reis-
wick and susanne were entertaining each other in the
bathroom susanne was having her morning bath-
rather late-but then mrs smithson said that she always
slept late reiswick just sat there and looked at the little
girl finally the rich man took a deep breath as he said
so that is a baby
a twentieth century homunculus



  til say it is answered the proud father

  she is my child said the beautiful dark woman in a
very proud voice in my language i call her a flower
from god  she took the baby out of the water
reis wick held out his arms

  please let me hold her for a minute

  and there the little one lay looking up with wondering
eyes at the big man playing with the golden football that
hung from his watch chain what passed between the
baby and the old football star was hard to say but no
doubt it was a very important idea

  the rich man and the young shipping clerk rode back
to the office in silence as they left the automobile reis-
wick said

  i am going to double your salary i want you to be
able to take good care of your wife and baby if she
ever is sick send for the best specialist and i will pay
the bill you are a fortunate man to have a child

  all that afternoon reiswick sat thinking in his private
office he refused to see anyone or to answer the tele-
phone at five he called up dr stanfield and asked him
to take supper with him the doctor refused and pled a
previous engagement he was sharply told to break it
that there was a thousand dollar fee if he would give
reiswick the evening as a result the two men dined in
the millionaires apartment

  what i want is this said reiswick and i am not
going to beat around the bush i want to be a father
why not get married

  you told me this morning that if i did the odds were
against me so why marry i want at least an even
break in any game i play

  well you could try it

  too much gamble i must be reasonably sure there
is no time to spare i want a child just as soon as i can
get one i actually saw a baby this morning

  why not marry and adopt that child 

  i am not rich enough the parents would not sell it
they love it too much it is interesting the mother is
from burmah and does all her own cooking and house-
work i actually held their little girl baby in my lap
give me their address i am investigating all inter-
esting babies for the rockefeller foundation we feel
if we can find out how some parents live and have chil-
dren that we may find the reason for other married men
and women not having children

  go ahead here is his name and address but such
investigations take too long to please me i want a baby
at once and it would not be fair to a lady to marry
her i have to be sure

  in other words you want to be a father

  yes

  the important thing for you is not to have a wife but
to have a child

  that is it

  you should have lived a few hundred years earlier
at that time ladies were not looked upon with much
favor lots of scientists felt that the human race would
be much finer in every way if there was only one gender
the masculine one during that time there was a doctor
called paracelsus some thought that he was a quack and
then others were sure that he was a very wise man if
he were living today he might be able to help you as he
claimed in one of his books that he was able to make
human beings without the help of the female sex he
called these interesting children by the interesting name
of homunculis and they were all men and all very bril-

liant mentally i happened to think of it and brought
the book with me

  stop your nonsense the thing is impossible

  it would seem so let me read you the exact descrip-
tion which he has left to us here are his directions to
anyone who wants to follow them and for fifteen min-
utes he read to reiswick out of a very old leather-bound
book then he closed the book

  he claimed that he made many of these little wise
men and sold them to the nobility of europe for court
advisors

  reiswick scratched his head

  i am not very well educated he finally said i took
the football course the four years i was at columbia but
frankly the thing seems impossible to me

  it does to me too admitted dr stanfield but there
is this to say about it here is an exact description of an
experiment in biology we look upon it as an impossi-
bility but we have to admit that no one has ever dupli-
cated that experiment in this scientific age and actually
found out for themselves that it will not work however
there is a man out in chicago who is doing some inter-
esting things with frogs eggs he takes the eggs and
irritates them with a needle or with acid and every now
and then one of them matures without being fertilized
this man is a recluse but he has done a great deal of
work in parthenogenesis i met him once and did not
know whether he was insane or just queer perhaps you
might induce him to do some work for you along the lines
of paracelsus

  give me his name and address said reiswick rather
grimly if money and science can give me a baby i
am going to be a father you collect your fee from my
privatef secretary i am off to chicago on the next
train if i go on the pennsylvania i can fly from cleve-
land to chicago and save some time i would like to
talk more with you about this but i am growing older
every minute and have no time to spare

  in a most unceremonious manner he rushed out of the
dining room and shouted orders to his valet before
dr stanfield realized what had happened he heard the
front door of the apartment slam

  ohn reiswick was on his way to chicago
hermopheles jones was working at a low powered
microscope with frog eggs one at a time he focussed
on them till he secured a perfect view and then with a
very delicate needle he scratched the thin enclosing mem-
brane now and then he broke an egg others he scratched
poorly when he made a perfect mark he smiled he
had decided to scratch fifteen hundred more eggs if
ten of them survived the injury and started to grow he
would be satisfied if two kept on growing he would be
delighted

  meantime his wife was working as a seamstress to sup-
port the family including her husband and two aged
parents so far there had been no children and the
learned biologist had been too much interested in frogs
eggs to appreciate this fact he certainly did not worry
over it

  he may have heard reiswick speak to him but he gave
no sign of it it is possible that he felt a strong hand
on his shoulders but he kept on working with the eggs
suddenly he felt himself lifted off the stool and forcibly
dumped down in a chair standing in front of him a
great man demanded if he was hermopheles jones
the biologist glared at his visitor as he replied


amazing

stories

  yes and you spoiled a perfectly good egg

  dont worry about that i will buy you another one
i came all the way from new york to see you and i
have no time to waste i want to be a father i want a
baby

  you let me go back to work are you insane i
dont have any babies go to an orphan asylum

  dr stanfield of new york told me that you knew
more about eggs than any living man do you know
about paracelsus  could you repeat his experiment and
find out whether he was telling the truth or not 

  the scientist beamed his joy rushing over to the
door he locked it and then returned to his visitor

  some think i am insane he confided and if they
knew what i really think they would be sure of it para-
celsus do i know him why man that old scientist
is my god i think that he was one of the most wonder-
ful biologists that ever lived i have read and reread
his work and the only thing that has kept me from re-
peating all of his experiments has been a serious lack
of funds think how marvelous it would be life
without the female sex i have an idea that it would
make a perfect world others can say that paracelsus
was a charlatan if they want to but i really believe that
he was able to do all that he claimed to be able to do
now i have done a lot of work with eggs i probably
have done more with frogs eggs than any living man
but i am too poor to work along the lines of that great
swiss

  i have the money said reiswick simply how
much do you want 

  so then and there they talked the matter over

  money can accomplish wonders it is not surprising
therefore to find that hermopheles jones was torn from
his chicago retreat his family were amply provided
for in every way for a three-year period for the first
time in his scientific life the biologist was able to buy
everything that he wanted to make a really accurate study
of the primary source of life-from the masculine view-
point

  a small island in an isolated part of the pacific ocean
was bought at a fabulous price from the french gov-
ernment on this island a small but wonderfully com-
plete town was built overnight out of houses brought
from san francisco in sections a colony of thirty
persons comprising every possible form of brains and
labor required for such an undertaking was transported
from the states in all of these preparations john
reiswick took a leading part as he was eminently fitted
to organize and direct any undertaking in fact he
suggested several accessories to the equipment which had
not entered the minds of any of the other members of the
research group one of these was a herd of goats with
an experienced goat herder another was a small
hospital fully equipped for all emergencies and especially
able to care for babies two graduate nurses were
taken along to care for this hospital also a young
doctor to care for the health of the colony and help
entertain the nurses reiswick wisely said that since the
final purpose of the expedition was to make him a
father it would be well to be fully prepared to care for
the babies when they arrived that was the real pur-
pose of the hospital and of the herd of goats

  the rich man had so arranged his business that he
could be absolutely free from any responsibility for at
least three years he wanted to have a real vacation
at the same time he was so accustomed to the conveni-

ences of a modern office that at the last moment he had
added to the equipment an extra room fully furnished to
serve as his office even to the stenographer who was to
be his private secretary as this idea had entered his
mind but a few days before the ship sailed from san
francisco he was unable to secure the services of a
stenographer from his new york office and therefore was
forced to employ one from the city of the golden gate
he realized that there would be little business to be
transacted but because he wanted to keep his mind occu-
pied he determined to follow out an ambition of years
and write three books one a history of football the other
an account of the four years he had played at columbia
and the third a prophecy of what would happen to foot-
ball in the future if the continued disuse of muscles and
the increased use of machinery made men smaller and
weaker he had devoted more time to sports in college
than he had to literary composition and therefore in his
selection of a private secretary he was careful to em-
ploy a young lady who was fully able in every way to
assist him in the details of perfect literary work

to say that ruth stilson was a modern girl in every
way would have done her an injustice she had
not gone through the world with her eyes shut but she
had kept her fingers carefully crossed and devoted her-
self to the perfecting of herself in her lifes ambition
rather than to the following of the bright pathways of the
ultra-modern youth all her life she had wanted to
write a book as a child she was always scribbling on
paper with a pencil her study of stenography was a part
of the preparation she made in college she majored in
english and her old professor openly stated that she
had a better idea of the correct use of the comma than
any student whom he had ever passed through his
classes she was not beautiful but she was brilliant from
an intellectual standpoint she was not modern but she
never used the split infinitive she did not live the life
of a flapper but she adored watching her in fact she
had composed a very serious essay entitled the dyna-
mite of adolescence

  it was this very serious-minded young lady who was
selected from over fifty applicants for the position to
be john reiswicks private secretary after talking to
her for a few minutes the ambitious man felt that she
was very safe socially and at the same time would be
remarkably helpful in the preparation of his manuscripts
she silently thrilled over the idea of three years on a
tropical island as she felt that the quiet and leisure would
enable her to rewrite and this time perfectly her great
american novel

  with his usual flair for organization reiswick had
overlooked no detail of the community life the ar-
rangements for feeding the colonists were complete as
two chinese cooks served daily an abundance of every
form of oriental fruit and vegetables with an occasional
young kid fresh fish or tropical fowl everyone had a
definite work to do and reiswick had taken no one that
could not do his work perfectly and at the same time
harmonize with the other colonists there was not only
work but amusement for all early in the history of the
the island a series of sports were arranged and a request
issued that each person spend at least two hours a day
in exercise a six-hole golf course was built and reis-
wick himself taught swimming to all who were not pro-
ficient in this sport he felt that the only way for a
healthy mental life to continue on the island was to keep
a twentieth century homunculus



everyone in the best possible physical condition this
was easy with all except hermopheles jones and the
three wild-eyed biologists whom he had induced to be
his co-workers in this great lif e-ad venture these four
scientists would never have left the workshop had it not
been for the insistent demands of the great american
who was spending several million in this biologic effort
to become a father in the shortest possible time

  reiswick had several serious conferences with jones
the biologist as is the case with many ultra-scientists
did not seem to comprehend the real urge behind the
spending of these millions of dollars he showed this
in one of his remarks to reiswick

  i consider the hospital inadequate he exploded
in fact the whole economic machinery is too small we
should have conducted this experiment in a great city
where there would be adequate facilities for the care of
hundreds and thousands of babies at the same time if
this experiment works at all we are just as likely to
have fifty thousand babies growing to maturity as we are
to have one what should we do with them what
good would thirty goats do  by the time we imported a
ship-load of milk those perfect children of my skill
would die of hunger besides our laboratories are not
large enough our glassware is inadequate you should
have listened to me

  you do not understand my purpose replied reis-
wick calmly i want to be a father but i have no
special yearning to be the father of fifty thousand babies
in fact i feel that if i had just one i would be satisfied
especially if it was a boy baby that was one reason
why i was interested in the statement of paracelsus all
of the babies he made were males of course if we
made fifteen at the same time and sent them all to co-
lumbia at once and formed a columbia-reiswick football
team it would be a rather fine performance but i am not
as enthusiastic about football as i was so i am not going
to be disappointed if the baby you make for me is a girl
so long as she grows to be as beautiful a woman as my
mother was of course back of everything is a desire
to do something towards preventing the human race
from going out of existence but primarily i regard this
as purely formative experimental work of a very personal
nature if you can make one baby there is no reason
why you cannot teach the scientists of the world how to
make babies in every large city and in that way the race
will be preserved of course we may only be able to
make males but perhaps they can get wives-in burmah
so you keep this in mind i want to be a father but i
do not want you to overdo it hi stop the whole work
and discharge you if you start turning out these babies
like a-like a-well like a swarm of bees

  the scientist threw up his hands in hopeless dismay as
he said

  but what am i to do suppose we are successful
and we have a thousand babies in the first experiment
do you want me to kill them-these beautiful results of
my scientific skill

  my mother used to warn me never to cross a bridge
before i came to it so far you have not made even one
baby in fact you tell me that you have not even started
to make a baby you wait till you actually have a
thousand babies and then you come to me and we will
decide what to do we may pick out ten or twelve of the
finest ones and concentrate on them

  then you are not going to let me grow fifty thousand
if i can

  certainly not think how it would make me feel to
be the father of fifty thousand boys and some of them
girls there are not enough names for that many we
would have to give them numbers and tattoo them to tell
them apart miss stillson would have to devote all her
time to making a card index for them why i should
have to endow several universities just to educate my
children and then-think of this i am not the richest
man in the states there are others with far more
wealth than i have and when one of us starts a new
fad they all enter into the most active competition
suppose it became known that i was the father of fifty
thousand children at once three or four other men
would never be satisfied till they had a hundred thou-
sand apiece and the large banking houses like morgans
might try to have five or ten million it just would never
do there might be an actual overproduction that is
why i selected a desert island for this work and pledged
every one to secrecy that is why i look over all out-
going mail so do not be too rash in your enthusiasm
i shall be satisfied if i have just one baby to call me
papa and i am going to love it just as much if it is a
girl as though it were a boy

  when reiswick returned to the office he repeated as
much of this conversation as he could remember to his
secretary one of his reasons for having an office and a
private secretary was to enable him to keep an accurate
diary of the work of the colony for this reason he made
jones dictate a daily statement of his progress of
course the work was so ultra-scientific and the language
used so pedantic that no one could have any idea of
what it meant except an equally learned biologist but
reiswick wanted a record of the work to stand as a text-
book for other men in their efforts to keep the human
race from final dissolution

more and more miss stillson became interested in
the efforts that the big man was making to become
a father she became so enthusiastic that she spent long
hours going over every detail of his ambition she even
cried a little as he told her of the years which had passed
without his even seeing a baby and then of the great
thrill and deep longing that had come over him when he
held the little child of the burmese woman in his arms

  i knew then he told her in the direct language that
he was always in the habit of using that wealth makes
no difference and fame is at best a temporary gesture
ambition can be selfish i found when i touched that
little baby that after all love is one of the great emotions
in life since my mother died i have had no one to love
me or to love-and it seemed to me that if i had a child
it would make life worth while that is why i am
spending three millions of my money and these three
years of my life here many of the colonists think that
jones is trying to make gold or a medicine to prolong
life but what he is really doing is more valuable than
gold and makes life really worth the living i should
rather be a poor man like my shipping clerk and have
the love of a child than be worth all of my millions

  as i remember it remarked the secretary your
shipping clerk was married and this child of his was a
natural child the result of the great love that can exist
between a man and a woman

  yes she was a burmese woman but very beautiful
they were poor but devoted to each other it is peculiar
how attached people can be when they are in love with
each other even when they are poor they had no


amazing stories

servants and she did all the cooking in the oriental style
he said that he would rather listen to his wife talk and
his baby coo than live in a fine hotel without them

  then they were in love 

  that is what they said i offered to buy the baby
but-nothing doing right then and there i made up
my mind to have a baby of my own i wanted to be a
father

  do you really believe that if hermopheles jones is
successful and makes a baby for you after the method
described by paracelsus you will be satisfied 

  i believe so i guess so of course it would be nicer
to have a baby-well like my shipping clerk did-but
the best authorities say it is a great gamble nowadays to
use their own language an increasing number of women
are showing idiopathic sterility if i married there
would be no surety of being a father and i could not be
cruel enough to divorce my wife just because she hap-
pened to be unfortunate

  but you would appreciate a wife the more i think
of it the more impossible your position seems take the
affair from the viewpoint of the child that baby is
entitled to a mother just as much as to a father what
are you going to tell the poor little thing when it grows
up now if you had a wife she could mother the little
baby even if it was of this peculiar paracelsian origin
then when the baby grew up it would have parents in-
stead of just a father it would be like other children
and that would make it happier then there is the atti-
tude of society you disappear from your friends for
three years and when you come back you have a little
baby how are you going to explain it  are you going
to tell your friends that it is a paracelsus baby they
will think that you are insane but if you have a wife
you can simply say this is our baby and your friends
will say what a lovely child she resembles the father
but she has her mothers eyes do you see there
would be no need of any awkward explanations

  i never thought of all that answered reiswick i
am a one-track man all i can think of now is to become
a father after i really have a baby i suppose these
other matters will come to my attention and then i will
deal with them as the necessity arises

  for some months he worked very hard on his three
books on football as a result he saw a good deal more
of ruth stillson than he did of any of the rest of the
colonists in fact he saw more of her than he had seen
of any woman during his entire life-except his mother
his secretarys intelligence made him envy her her
interest in his desires to become a father pleased him and
her ability to turn his dictation into beautiful english
made him determine that under no circumstances would
he ever permit her to work for any other man in other
words he fell in love with her and did not realize it
that is he did not know it till one day she was in swim-
ming and was stung by an electric ray fish she suffered
so she became unconscious and reiswick had to bring
her ashore where the doctor worked for some time to
resuscitate her during those anxious moments john
reiswick understood what it would be to be deprived of
her companionship for a lifetime instead of a few
minutes of unconsciousness he now realized what was
the matter with him

  the following sunday they were married by the
episcopalian clergyman who had been brought along to
look after the spiritual needs of the little colony with-
out doubt this marriage was one of the most noted events

occurring on the island the cook served a wonderful
dinner the ladies of the colony did their best to furnish
adequate floral decorations and combined all their ward-
robes to make the brides wedding dress even the four
biologists were forced to take a full days vacation

  after that came three glorious months of tropical
sunshine and lovely night illumined by the moon and
stars and melodied by the ceaseless throbbing of the surf
on the complaining coral strand the longer john
reiswick and his bride lived together the fonder they
became of the poetry of life and the less interested they
became in football and the great american novel at
times reiswick even lost sight of just why they had come
to the island

  then came the regular semi-annual visit of the private
steamer the captain brought confidential messages
that made the happy bridegroom go around with a long
face there was danger of war being declared between
the united states and japan of all the rich men of
america reiswick was the only one that wielded a
powerful influence with the little brown men of the
orient the president urged him to go to japan and
stay there till a better understanding could be arrived at
between the two great powers it was a request that
could not be ignored and reiswick at once saw that the
only thing he could decently do was to comply with the
request he dreaded to tell her but he felt that it would
not be wise for her to go with him war might be de-
clared at any time and there was the danger of subma-
rines to his surprise she was willing to remain on the
island it seemed that she was afraid of being seasick and
besides she felt that it was her duty to stay on the island
and look after his interests while he was away she
considered that there was too great an investment there
for both of them to go and leave it she ended her argu-
ment by saying

  hermopheles jones seems to feel that he is actually
making some progress he is always saying time will
tell and is remarkably optimistic if he really does pro-
duce a paracelsian baby in the next year all the more
reason for one of us being here to direct its care so you
go and come back as soon as you can and take good
care of yourself because i love you-and i am just go-
ing to die if anything happens to you

  that was the end of the argument reiswick gave a
multitude of orders a large amount of supplies was un-
loaded and then the steamer slowly disappeared into the
western seas ruth stillson reiswick cried she had
not known that love could hurt a woman so much

six months and some weeks passed reiswick was a
go-getter he had gone to japan to stop the war-
talk and promote a kindlier feeling between the two
nations and he had finally succeeded the japanese
emperor had decorated him with the order of the rising
sun the medal was a beautiful gold star encrusted
with diamonds and when reiswick first looked at it he
suddenly realized what a wonderful plaything it would
make for a baby the word baby recalled the island
and the biological jones and the lonely bride ruth who
was so patiently waiting for his return and in the mean-
time looking so efficiently after his interests pie radioed
the president of the united states that all was right in
japan and that he was leaving to look after his personal
interests then he boarded his steamer and told the
captain to put all the steam on and beat it for the island

  he arrived at the lonely island just at twilight the
a twentieth century homunculus



captain urged him to stay aboard ship till the next morn-
ing but he refused and ordered a boat to take him ashore
arriving there he walked rapidly to his home there
was no one there there was no one in the office then he
saw lights in the hospital building and went there a
group of colonists were seated on the steps the
preacher took reiswick to one side and told him in grave
tones that mrs reiswick was sick but that everything
was being done for her that was possible the excited
worried man rushed into the hospital but was told that
he could not see her not now she was too sick he asked
a hundred questions to which no one seemed to be able
or willing to give him any satisfactory or definite reply
at last he walked back to his office and sat down in his
favorite chair the chair opposite him was the one his
wife used to sit in when they were working on his booksr
he wondered how life would be if she never took any
more dictation what had he done to deserve this
why had fate made it necessary for her to die just when
he had come back to her

  then hermopheles jones came in he seemed as
downcast as reiswick at the same time he said that
the experiments were going along all right and that they
were at a point where he might be able to announce suc-
cess at any time he said that at times he was dis-
couraged  it seemed rather hard to follow paracelsus in
some of his experiments the language was ambiguous
but at the same time they were making progress reis-
wick heard him as though a spirit were talking across the
table finally jones said

  have a drink will you take one if i fix it

  no i am through with that sort of thing ruth
does not like it

  then he remembered that he should have said mrs
reiswick

  they sat there through the night finally the morning
came as it does come in the tropics with a great burst
of light like a flower of the dawn suddenly unfolding
from the bud reiswick heard the sound of laughter
confused voices and wondered if the women were hys-
terical great god that was it ruth was dead and
they were coming to tell him and it was too much for
them they were laughing and crying she had died
and he was not there with her at the last moment it
was cruel of them to shut him out a nurse came run-
ning into the room and in her arms was something in a
blanket and the white-gowned woman said

  oh mr reiswick and mr jones its a girl and
the finest you ever saw what do you think of that
mr jones a baby on the island

  the rich man was torn between emotions his wife
was dead and in spite of the pessimism of jones the
biologist had produced a baby through his tears he
smiled at the little man and wrung his hand

  i congratulate you he said this will make your
name immortal it was your brains and perseverance
that enabled you to show the world that paracelsus was
right

  he turned to the nurse

  take good care of this baby see that it is neglected
in no way start the goats milk according to the doc-
tors orders as soon as advisable i am going to have
her baptised and i am going to call her ruth after my
poor wife you can all understand how i feel about this
the success of the experiment leaves me cold if it had
happened before the illness of my wife i should have
been the happiest man on earth now please leave me

i want to spend a few minutes with my dead wife the
only woman who has loved me since my mother died
they gathered around him and tried to tell him some-
thing he simply shook his head like a stricken lion and
burst through them in his wild rush to the hospital the
nurse slowly followed him carrying the baby up the
steps and into the room that had the odor of chloroform
the doctor blocked the door and the doctor landed
outside the hospital on the ground then into the room
reiswick went and fell on his knees by the bed

  eternity passed and then he felt a hand straying
through his hair

  no one should do that but ruth he said and turned
to reprimand the nurse but he found that the hand was
ruths hand as was the wan smile she was not dead at
all not at all she had just been sick but she was
better now wonderful fine exquisite ruth
was alive and jones had a baby for them a little girl
baby and he had always wanted a girl baby
i am glad you came back whispered the wife

  i came just in time

  it was the baby pulling you back

  it was god bringing me home to you

  are you glad johnnie about the baby

  i certainly am jones is to be congratulated it is
all working out nicely you are going to get well and
the baby will have a mother

  its our baby

  you bet that is what we are going to tell her when
she grows up no use in her knowing about this para-
celsus stuff how about it though shall i tell jones
to go ahead and make fifteen or twenty more

  right now i think that one is enough whispered
ruth stillson reiswick her request was a command to
the rich man

  he looked up at the nurse who was holding the baby
you let me have that baby and you go and tell dr
jones i want to see him

  in no time the biologist entered the room reiswick
faced him and in the millionaires arms the baby slept

  dr jones you have done fine and from what i
have seen of this little baby whom i am going to legally
adopt as my daughter she comes very nearly being a
real fine child in every way i congratulate you and i
will see that you are kept in comfort for the rest of
your life if you want to you can go ahead with your
studies it may be that you can arrange with the french
government to supply them with a hundred thousand
babies but as far as i am concerned i am ready to stop
my wife and i have talked this matter over and she
thinks that even fifteen babies would be too many so
i want you to dismantle the workshop everything ia
it belongs to you we are going to close this colony and
as soon as mrs reiswick has recovered from this strange
illness we will go back to new york

  you want me to stop

  yes as far as i am concerned

  right when i felt i was on the point of success
yes i consider that you and i have shown that para-
celsus was right if the work is to be conducted on a
large scale it will be in some other place than this
island

  the biologist left the room reiswick sat down beside
the bed and held his wifes hand on the other side of
the bed the nurse sat holding the baby mrs reiswick
looked at her husband

nnms is a unique story indeed we have had numerous tales giving the
 possible reactions of a twentieth-century person who suddenly finds him-
self transplanted by one means or another into the far-distant future we
who are living in this century being thoroughly acclimatized see nothing
humorous or even ludicrous in many of our situations our new author has
an excellent sense of values which coupled with a good sense of humor
makes possible this tale depicting the feelings of a roman of ancient times
when he finds himself suddenly in the heart of new york in the twentieth
century a good touch of edgar allan poe in the story adds greatly to its
literary value

  authors note under no consideration will
the author reveal the identity of the person
marcus publius mentioned in this story

  our hero is now isolated in comfortable sur-
roundings and is perfectly satisfied with his
moderate luxuries while enjoying complete
freedom and peace of mind in his seclusion
many readers will not sanction the authors
action in effecting marcus escape from the

b- insane asylum it is hoped that the

reader will appreciate the authors position after
reading the following manuscript this manu-
script or report was of course written in latin
and is given unaltered other than the authors
translation as received from marcus hand
may the reader judge for himself as to the
sanity of our hero

w w d

  this following inscription in english was first
to meet the authors eyes when the herein men-
tioned package was opened

kind sir

  because of my belief that you are the one
man who can and will help me i have selected
you from the many visitors that come to this
asylum  have long awaited your coming and
i now hope that my cautious selection will not
be unavailing

  behind the bars of this cell i have been im
prisoned the past year i am without funds or
friends i am a stranger within a strange land
pray heed my call for the thing i ask of you
is so small in itself i seek no alms neither
do i ask your help in effecting my escape for
i would have you do no wrong

  all that i ask is that you take the enclosed
letter or report and dispatch it to the parties
designated first read it yourself see the vast
importance of my communicating with my
countrymen then place it in the proper chan-
nels that it may reach those mentioned it is a
little favor i ask pray do not fail me i be-
seech you to make all haste lest i truly become
demented like my fellow prisoners in this mad
house

marcus publius

the report

greetings o caesar greetings honorable
senate greetings to all roman countrymen
i am alive i marcus publius have sur-
vived  the great experiment is a success
witness my hand as proof lest someone
doubt that i am alive

  i bring great honor to rome i have discovered a new
and strange land it is called the united states

  my head is filled with the many wonders i have be-
held my heart is overflowing with the desire to en-
lighten immediately all rome with this report but i
must begin at the beginning guiding you through my
experiences in chronological order lest my countrymen
doubt the truth of this letter for i myself have some-
times doubted if i am really alive and not with the gods

  i will date the report nov a  the present date
according to my calculation although these united
statesians term it november  ad

  it will be remembered that on jparilia a  all rome
was agog over the embarking of the cask i had offered
myself as a martyr to science and after a night of feast-
ing and many toasts i submitted to the committees
administering of a sleep-endowing drug i knew of
naught until i was revived one year later aprilis a 
by a citizen of this united states although he contended
that many years had passed my rescuer called himself
professor emil haskell and gave me a detailed account
of the condition in which i was found

  the professor was a very learned man well versed in
the science and arts of this land while on a private
expedition of deep-sea research in what he called tropi-
cal waters he discovered the cask floating near his pri-
vate yacht puzzled by the appearance of this cake of
ice in a warm sea he had the cask lifted aboard by
means of the yachts boat davits

  in the hot sun on the dry deck of the yacht the frosty
coating on the cask soon disappeared and brought forth
in clarity the latin inscription on the outer casing pro-
fessor was overjoyed with his discovery when he read

  whosoever findeth this cask will leave it unopened
and immediately communicate with the society of roman

	the author translates t parilia a  as april   bc nov a 

as november s bc




amazing stories

medical scientists provided the discovery is made one
year later than the date parilia a  this cask con-
tains a living man whose life has been preserved as an
experiment in science and any premature tampering with
or opening of this vessel will result in the occupants
death persons finding this cask will keep it covered
from the suns rays as the occupant is frozen in liquid
oil at an extremely low temperature take heed for this
cask is under the seal of julius caesar

  accepting the inscription at its face value professor
haskell immediately returned to his dwelling on river-
side drive in the city of new york of this united states
during the trip homeward he planned in detail the task
of my revival and it was due to this careful advanced
thought and to professor haskells wonderfully trained
mind that i am alive today had someone of lesser
mentality made the discovery i fear that i should not
have survived to write this report

  jealously guarding his secret from all the professor
had the cask placed in his private laboratory and after
gathering the necessary equipment he proceeded to bring
me back to life a week later after i had fully re-
covered he showed me the remains of the cask and ex-
plained each step he made in effecting my revival

  he spoke first of removing the outer covering without
much difficulty but was dismayed upon hearing the hiss-
ing noise as he punctured the second covering until he
discovered that it was only the releasing of the vacuum
insulation he then noticed that the coating of frost
on the inner copper tank was becoming heavier and he
hurriedly effected an opening large enough to admit
light upon looking down he was startled to see me in
full view lying within since he expected to find some
other inner container as will be remembered the pre-
serving oil in which i was immersed was of a clear straw
color and came from our deep well at the very low
temperature or of  degrees below zero fahrenheit
according to the professors scale these united states-
ians measured heat and cold in degrees and their freez-
ing point was  degrees above zero thus the profes-
sor estimated that our oil was really  degrees below
freezing he defined the oil as being a mixture of oil
and about  per cent of what he termed carbon dioxide
gas with a small portion of helium

  professor haskell claimed to be very well acquainted
with our low temperature oil of rome and he said
there was another oil-well which produced a similar mix-
ture in this country at a place he called jackson county
colorado the well in this county had been worked for
commercial use the oil being heated by pipes of live
steam until the substance was of an atmospheric temper-
ature i give this information to show that professor
haskell was familiar with our fluid and knew the con-
ditions under which he was working

  unaffected by the shock of seeing my body in plain
view the professor immediately made a larger hole
in the cask and drained off the oil insulating his
hands with heavy towels professor haskell then re-
moved my body to a small cell where he had formerly
kept a large gorilla for experimental purposes he then
wrapped me in what he termed electrical blankets and
by carefully regulating the applied heat he brought my
body back to normal temperature at the right moment
he injected into my heart a drug known as adrenalin
which started pulsation and restored animation thus
did i again become alive

  it is needless to state that had not this united states

drug adrenalin been recently discovered and available
and had not professor haskell been acquainted with its
use i should have perished in vain as soon as my body
had attained normal temperature the professor evi-
dently felt very sure of himself as he gave no thought
of having violated the order of the society of roman
medical scientists and seemed to care not that he had
broken the seal of julius ccesar when he opened the
cask

  the reason for professor haskells placing me in the
small cell was soon apparent he wanted to keep me a
prisoner until he had finished writing a book daily
he would visit me and after supplying food and water
he would question me for hours at a time i could see
no wrong in telling him of the wonders of our rome
of our manner of living and of all the facts concerning
our great statesmen in exchange he taught me his
native language called english he was congenial in
every respect but insisted that i remain confined in the
cell after a month of this i noticed him tittering and
chuckling to himself at times and i reasoned that he must
be going mad he practically confirmed this view one
day when he boastfully declared that sweet revenge was
soon to be his he told me that he had nearly finished
his book and that it would revolutionize all history and
make his fellow scientists look ridiculous i realized
that i had been liberated from the cask by a maniac
only to be made a captive again

daily i watched for a chance to escape from my
cell but professor haskell was as crafty as he was
learned and always was careful to remain at a safe
distance lest i reach him through the bars

  the more i talked and listened to him the more i
realized that he was on the verge of total insanity his
wonderful brain had reached the snapping point un-
doubtedly the fruits of mental over-development and his
neglect of physical exercise in desperation i racked my
brain for a plan whereby i could obtain freedom before
it was too late

  in order that my countrymen may know the condition
of my captors mind and in justification of my later ac-
tion to obtain freedom i shall cite a few examples of
the idiotic statements professor haskell often made and
would have me believe

  he would have it that the land and sea were round like
a ball i did my best to nullify this mad hallucination
repeating to him time and again that we romans have
long since known the world to be flat i even told him of
those who had been to the top of mountains and had
proved this flat-theory by viewing the straight line of the
horizon but all of this was of no avail as professor
haskell was very set in his views like all men of science
who have their own pet theories

  he even went so far as to say that the land and sea
moved the professor thought that the sun was more
or less stationary and that it was the earth that moved-
everything turning over during the night this he
claimed caused the sun to appear to rise and set while
it was the land that actually moved i assured him that
this was not the case as i had frequently been up all
night on affairs with ladies and although the land did
seem to be a bit unsteady at times it was nothing but the
result of drinking too much wine i further assured him
that i had often watched shadows of our buildings slowly
crawl across the promenade of the forum thus proving
that the sun moved
the ice man



  professor haskell was at his worst when he would
have me believe that there was no great edge to the sea
he contended that the water of the sea bent around a
curve this seemed to be the most idiotic of all his
statements save one for it is evident to the most un-
educated person that water is always flat and level how
could it be otherwise 

  according to the professor his united states was
around this bend from rome he claimed to know all
about our land and acted very superior when discussing
maps and countries nevertheless i noticed that he con-
tinually questioned me regarding our cities the construc-
tion of our buildings and homes and upon all matters
concerning our republic this was very strange action
indeed for one who was supposed to know as much as
professor haskell pretended

  the most colossal falsity the professor would have me
swallow was that i am  years old he estimated that
our parilia a  was really what he termed april  
before his god was discovered he claimed that the
present date was  after his god was discovered
knowing my age was twenty-five upon entry as i had
told him that was my age he figured that i had been
confined in the cask some  years

  i believe that he was trying to beat down my spirit by
casting reflections upon my intellect however i was
not fooled nor would i allow my brain to become muddled
with his wild assertions i could see for myself that i
had not aged physically and by clever questioning i se-
cured his admission that we were just finishing the
winter season thus as i had embarked last spring
it was easy to deduce that only a year had passed since i
entered the cask i was not to be fooled simply because
the united states had their own trick calendar a calen-
dar based on the time they discovered that there was a
god

  i wondered what they would do when the discovered
that there are many gods

  professor haskell often admired my physical develop-
ment he would stand and watch the knotting and
bunching of my rippling muscles as i daily disrobed and
performed the national roman calisthenic drill while
i am only physically equal to the average roman citizen
i was far superior to professor haskell he being little
more in body than a well developed child i finally con-
ceived a plan whereby i could use his admiration for my
strength as a means of escape

  striking a boastful pose i called to him and offered to
show how easily i could crush the back of a chair in my
cell this started a little game in which he furnished
articles such as sticks and beams to test my strength
cunningly i played the game until finally he unthinkingly
offered the article i long desired it was a short piece of
metal rod that he had used to open the cask he called
it a crowbar

  with assumed difficulty i bent the bar across my knee
and with the right degree of aloofness tossed it on the
floor within my cell soon after professor haskell left
the laboratory and gave me the opportunity i had long
awaited

  straightening out the crowbar i reached through the
bars of the cell and used it to twist off the little lock that
held the door to one who was familiar with the roman
lever principles it required little effort to destroy this
fastening

  gathering my toga about the waist i crouched by
the wall near the door and awaited the professors return

my ever burning desire to forge ahead of the natural
sequence of events and blurt forth in loud acclaim
the many wonders of this newly discovered land the
united states has been hard to withstand roman citi-
zens i can picture you standing in rapt attention before
the senate as my humble report is read from the ros-
trum your eagerness to learn of the miracles i have
beheld is no greater than my desire to enrich your knowl-
edge but i feel that i must continue in logical order
giving each event as it happened lest some may mis-
construe the happenings which i later reveal however
i promise that your wait will not be in vain when you
hear of my stroll along new yorks thoroughfares

  while crouching near the door i thought over a plan
of action it was one whereby i could dispose of the
professor in the shortest time possible i was eager to
have him out of the way and to be able to set out on my
own in quest of new adventures for i had become weary
of the sight of the four walls in which i had been held
captive for over a month true there were appliances
within the laboratory that i wished to learn more about
for the professor had jealously withheld any information
except that regarding my study of english but some-
how i felt that i must flee the confinement i had endured
and again breathe pure air with the sky overhead a
months imprisonment had given me the heart of a
woman and i had caught myself in moods of sympathy
with our galley-slaves

  at last i heard the approach of footsteps i tensed
my muscles in readiness my chance for freedom had
arrived

  true to habit the professor opened the door and
strode a full six paces before he realized i was not within
the cell i was upon him in a flash and bowled him over
with one blow quickly placing him in the cell i
twisted the crowbar around the door and made a much
better fastener than the flimsy padlock gathering my
toga about me i fled through the door from which the
professor had just entered i quickly mounted a
stairway

  at the top of this stairs i encountered another door
that barred the way it was a strong wooden panel and
contained within the edge was a new type of fastener
quite unlike the padlock of the cell a small knob pro-
truded just below a little metal disc it offered practically
no working area for any roman lever principle that i
might have employed i searched in vain for a solution
to the secret straining against the panel with my strong
shoulders but the door was well made and withstood
all my efforts i later learned that the door could have
been easily opened with a small notched metal strip that
fits in the little disc above the handle it was known as
a yale key and i was told that many young united
statesians in the yale school carried these keys they
were used for private apartments

  returning to the laboratory i perceived that the pro-
fessor had recovered consciousness straightway he be-
gan begging for his release i admired the professors
nerve but turned a deaf ear to his pleas for i thought
that he deserved a bit of his own medicine i also gave
him to understand that the only thing that had restrained
me from twisting his neck was the fact that he had found
the cask and had restored my life nevertheless i be-
lieve he realized that one should not imprison a roman
citizen

  i searched the room for some other means of escape
while professor haskell watched me with his hawk-like


amazing stories

eyes evidently the laboratory had been constructed in
the cellar of his home for i noticed that the walls were
of a stone composition and that two small windows were
up near the ceiling they were closed by shutters on
the outside while i was making this survey my atten-
tion was attracted to the construction overhead small
boards had been used to make the floor above although
the cross beams between were of heavy wood this board-
ing above appeared to be of light material i also
noted two long white shafts hanging a short distance
from the ceiling i later learned that these were heat
pipes containing steam they offered an ideal foothold
in a new plan that quickly came to my mind

  with the aid of a small box i was able to mount these
shafts they felt soft and warm to the touch in this
manner i secured a position on my back with my feet
against the small boarding above using my arms to as-
sist the knee leverage i was able to exert considerable
force and soon i had a few boards kicked loose from
their fastenings then it was comparatively easy to
push my foot through to the floor above and create an
opening large enough to admit my body

  professor haskell made one last gesture to detain
me when he saw that i had met with success and would
soon be free this last effort resulted in the finish of his
brilliant career as it was destined to cost him his life
no doubt his act would have taken my life also had i
not been well trained in the roman art of leaping but
it was perhaps best that he ended as he did for i was
convinced that he was totally insane

  i suspected nothing when he asked that i hand him his
unfinished manuscript of history that lay on the table
he intimated that he might as well work in the cell until
some of his servants came and released him i came
down from my perch in the ceiling to grant his last
wish as i gave him his work he thanked me and gave
vent to a low sigh i now see that his sigh was in relief
over having his manuscript in a safe place remote from
the scene of my intended extermination

  i should have been suspicious when he tendered me
his purse filled with united states paper money i well
know that men of science are not usually susceptible to
the passion of charity however i accepted his donation
as a form of roman levy it seemed natural for him to
want me to have some funds when starting out alone in
a strange land i could not suspect his real motive
that of having me appear to be a dead thief if his diaboli-
cal scheme had proved successful

  as i turned to go professor haskell ventured that i
could extinguish his little electrical stove on which he
was brewing a bowl of brownish liquid called coffee he
seemed to think that the coffee would boil over before
his servants came to his rescue although i was unfa-
miliar with the mechanism of this electrical device i
wanted to make the professor as comfortable as possible
i felt like a young husband ready to go out on a party
with a purse full of money and freedom in the offing
any little whim the professor had in mind was proper
to be granted

  seeing that i fumbled with the electrical stove he ad-
vised me that the best method of extinguishing it was to
immerse it in a pail of water i could pour this from a
large red container at hand eager to serve him i
poured out the liquid it was as clear as spring water
but had a pungent odor i thought this was due to stag-
nation little did i suspect that this liquid was highly
explosive it was called gasoline a sudden desire to

hurry and quit the place made me toss the stove in the
open pail from a short distance instead of immersing
it as the professor directed this saved my life for
immediately the liquid flared up in a great flame that
would have consumed me had i been standing over the
pail leaping back i was just barely able to clear the
fire professor haskell fell in a swoon when he per-
ceived that i had escaped his fiery death trap

  i saw at a glance that i just had time to make my exit
through the opening above if i hurried i noticed that
the fire was growing in volume as i climbed quickly
aloft the spreading flames were igniting the oil that
had been drained from the cask during the past month
this oil had been left standing in a huge open tub and
had resumed a normal temperature as all of the carbon
dioxide had escaped the heat was terrific as the new
flames flared up like burning pitch

  by a superhuman effort i managed to crawl out of
the opening and roll over on the floor above while the
flames began licking up through the hole i lay for an
instant thinking of the professors fate i would much
rather have had the pleasure of seeing him fed to the
lions in our dear old coliseum

  after a deep breath or two i arose and wandered
through many rooms and passageways not a soul was
in sight and i finally found an outer door that opened
on a court in the rear of the dwelling unnoticed i
managed to run across this court with a quick leap i
scaled a high wall that surrounded the estate and dropped
into a small street i later learned that this street was
only an alley the streets of this united states are
great wide thoroughfares and even this alley was quite
wide compared to our streets of rome hurrying along
i soon came upon one of these spacious thoroughfares
at last i was free

free at last on the streets of the united states yet
i saw nothing as much as i would like to tell you
romans of what i first witnessed as much as i would
like to know myself verily i can remember nothing
looking back on my first few moments of freedom i
realize that my mind did not absorb any of the many
wonders i must have witnessed when i walked away
from the inferno that i had started in the professors
laboratory i was blind to everything but the path before
me i had just tasted the first draught of a newly dis-
covered winefreedom a months imprisonment

in professor haskells cell followed by my sudden
liberation had made me experience a new form of in-
toxication

  freedom wine of wines freedom a drink entirely
unknown to one who is a roman citizen my blood
tingled in great ecstacy as i felt the fire of freedoms
nectar a nectar such as is sipped only in dreams oh
men of rome i entreat you to try a taste of my new-
found vintage bind yourself as a slave unto a stranger
for a month only mingle and work with the slaves and
when the time is up verily i prophesy that you will en-
joy a drink many times worthy of your exile our best
wine nassicum will seem like grape husks compared to
this new quaff you will as never before appreciate the
freedom of roman citizenship have a little drink on
me

  i have recalled one thing that came to my notice the
street which i had chosen was as smooth as polished
stone but i might as well have been strolling on any
one of our rough narrow thoroughfares in rome for ail
the ice man



else i can recall i could not even remember the same
street should i happen on it again thus was the condi-
tion of my mind

  however at the next intersection i was rudely
awakened from my haziness terror filled my heart
yea terror even if i am a roman citizen for i was
confronted with a fiendish monster to my intimate
friends that will sound as if i had become like a woman
for it is well known that i fear nothing mortal my
bravery upon entering the cask should prove my courage
and fearlessness but i defy any roman-yea even
the mighty julius caesar himself as brave as he is

known to beto have stood in my place and to have

felt other than afraid i was alone a stranger a new-
born babe in a land of seeming terrors and mysteries
i wras encompassed by the unknown i was confronted
with a thing that had the broken unrealities of a phan-
tasm hear me as i tell of what i saw

  my eyes were on my pathway i had nearly reached
the corner suddenly bedlam broke loose a piercing
eerie cry rent the air an uncanny wail of rising cadences
it seemed to pour ice into my veins at the same mo-
ment a hundred bells started clanging the crash of a
thousand thunders roared about my ears i looked up to
see many citizens scurrying from the streets chaos was
everywhere

  looking down the cross avenue i beheld an ungodly
sight a huge red land-monster was coming to recapture
me in great lurching leaps and bounds it came directly
for me it was as tall as two men and as long as a small
ship two great eyes as large as the moon hungrily
sought me out from the crowd men were clinging to
the sides of the monster urging it on to greater speed
in a glance i saw another similar monster was immediate-
ly behind the first off in the distance others were
following

  turning to flee i saw that my path was cut off by still
others approaching from the rear what chance of free-
dom i thought had one in a land where they send
shrieking red monsters lumbering after their captives
i closed my eyes and awaited the end my head was held
erect my chest thrust forward i stood like a true
roman unflinchingly awaiting death

  but my time had not yet come

  with a thundering roar that made the very ground
upon which i stood tremble the monster swept past me
opening my eyes i was just in time to see the second
monster pass i gave vent to a low chuckle of relief
for i saw that my fear was groundless again i was a
true roman who laughs when close death is thought to
have passed i saw that what i had thought were huge
red land-monsters were only fire-fighting machines used
in the united states their piercing cry and clanging
bells were only to clear the path my recapture was not
wanted again i laughed to compose myself for verily
i will admit i was afraid

  noting that the machines had stopped a short distance
down the street i hurried along to examine them better
and what marvels i beheld they were a sort of chariot
 a four- or six-wtheeled chariot and the most amaz-
ing part was that they had moved at terrific speed with-
out the aid of horses pails axes ladders bells and
great sections of fiber pipe adorned the chariots in a
very decorative manner numerous special fittings
glistened like polished gold at the forward end was the
device that propelled the machine in place of horses it
was called the engine it breathed in loud puffing snorts

it was this noise that i had first thought was thunder
this snorting and blowing was cleverly controlled by a
man in charge the engine was used even when the
machine was stationary to blow water through the fiber
pipes with tremendous force the other end of the
pipes was then directed on the fire the water shooting
out in great fountains the two large eyes as big as
moons wrere great lanterns they were used to throw
out piercing beams of light whenever the chariot traveled
at night the entire body of the machine was painted
a violent red

  great was the admiration of the united states citi-
zens for their fire-fighting chariots a vast throng had
quickly gathered to witness it in operation a stout
rope was immediately stretched waist high across the
street to hold back the surging multitude a large black-
covered horseless-chariot brought a squad of ushers to
the scene they immediately began their duties of keep-
ing the crowd behind the rope these ushers were very
important individuals whose sharp nasal voices bespoke
of earlier training as auctioneers or fish merchants i
know now that they were the city guards called cops
i had occasion later to know them intimately

  suddenly there was a loud explosion across the street
smoke and flames burst from every window of a mag-
nificent stone castle i realized that this was professor
haskells dwelling and that i was the one who had started
the fire i stood in awe watching the great billows of
smoke and streaming tongues of flame as they leaped
skyward professor haskell must have kept other ex-
plosive liquids in his laboratory and the fire had taken
a little time to reach them however the flames were
enveloping the entire building and reminded me of our
vesuvius

  strange to relate the men in charge of the fire-fighting
machines gave no heed to the burning building instead
they directed their streams of water on the adjoining
houses which were not burning at all this seemed a
very queer way to put out a fire but i reasoned that
the men must have had a certain system of procedure
and i did not feel called upon to offer any advice per-
haps they also knew the professor

  realizing that the house would be a total loss and that
everything in it would be consumed i slowly withdrew
from the front ranks i tried to attract as little attention
as possible for i knew that if i was suspected in the least
i should be subjected to severe questioning even though
i felt that i could cope with any inquiry that might
arise-for i have had much training in the art of roman
evasion-i perceived that my task would be very diffi-
cult as the last shreds of my identity must have been
obliterated in the fire little did i then realize that i
should later wish that i had stepped forward and made
myself known some evidence might have then been
saved but at the time i gave no thought to this my
sole idea was to place as much distance as possible be-
tween myself and the fire

as i strolled away from the conflagration i began see-
 ing so many wonders at once that it is hard for
me to set them down in any order of recognition

  i have said that i was in the united states this was
true but i was also in the largest city of this country-
new york i have long since learned from contact with
the many natives of this new york that it is the only city
of any consequence however there are a few other
cities out in a part of the country known as the sticks


  amazing stories

hereafter i will speak of being in new york and it will
be understood that i also mean the united states

  on my right was a large river named the hudson it
looked like our tiber river except that the boats did not
have any sails while some of the vessels were small
and similar to our war-barges there were also others of
great size these massive ships carried many passengers
and were called ferries and steamers i thought these
must be the biggest ships human hands could construct
but i later witnessed a marvelous colossal floating city
a huge ship made entirely of metal and as great in size
as a whole section of rome as i said none of the ships
had sails they were all propelled by an engine similar
to that of the fire-fighting chariots in fact the engine
wras one of the most wonderful and useful inventions of
this land it was used in almost every conceivable man-
ner whenever energy or power was required

  i suspect that scores of roman citizens are already
doubting my word for i know that it is hard for one to
believe that there could be any ships as large as i have
mentioned it must be equally as hard for you romans
to picture a little metal engine doing the work of thou-
sands of horses but i swear on my honor as a roman
citizen that these truths are just as i have pictured them
pray treat my report with an open mind for even more
fantastic things are yet to come-ships that fly elec-
tricity radio pictures that move and talk subways-
but wait i must not go ahead of my story i only hope
that it will be remembered that i have investigated every
thing about which i write i have fully recovered from
my first fear of the supernatural i no longer look upon
fire-fighting apparatus as land-monsters i am counting
on the belief of you men of rome who saw me placed
in the cask for i am now in bondage again because the
citizens of this great new york will not believe that i
arrived in that manner these people who have created
unbelievable wonders are quick to doubt a lesser wonder
they call me the ice man because i tried to tell them
that i was frozen in the cask for a year the cops have
-but again i am wrandering from my report oh if i
were only the great cicero if i could only tell my
story in logical order but i am only marcus publius
and you romans will have to make allowances for my
lapses i will try again to stick to my report

  i was turning away from the river when i beheld the
next wonder suddenly a strange buzzing noise fell upon
my ears it was like the whirling drone of a giant bee
looking towards the sky from which the sound came i
beheld five huge birds flying in wedge-shaped order
even at their great height i saw that the birds were of a
strange species unknown to me their peculiar droning
buzz beat upon my ears like staccato thunder as i
looked they began to fall in a series of fluttering
spinning spirals they came until i thought they would be
dashed on the ground but even as i watched they re-
gained their equilibrium and skillfully glided down to
skim across the river i held my breath in wonder as
they gracefully came to rest on the waters smooth sur-
face i stared in open-mouthed amazement over their
great bulk and wondered how such gigantic birds could
have been caught and tamed looking closer i beheld a
sight that nearly swept me off my feet a citizen was
actually emerging from the birds mouth i could hardly
believe my eyes more citizens came forth-six in all
they gleefully waved to passengers on a passing ship

  at last it finally dawned on me that i was witnessing
another strange marvel of this new york inventions

of the gods the huge birds were great man-made

flying-ships

  i saw that the flying-ships were shaped very much like
a bird in full flight the wings did not fold up but re-
mained stiffly outstretched even after the flight was
over a large wind-mill had been placed in the nose of
the device another of those engines was used to turn
this wrind-mill at great speed the force thus sucked
the flying-ship through the air these flying-ships were
called airplanes there were no feathers on the devices

  turning away i made a vow that i would seek a
flight in one of these airplanes at the first opportunity i
walked along in deep thought wondering over the pos-
sibilities of an early return to rome in an airplane
what a greeting i would receive when i glided down
on the surface of the tiber i would be a hero nay
the hero of all times with my private airplane i could
lead great armies on to new victories with a load of
stones i could easily conquer the strongest cities i
would be made king ladies would flock to me in
droves riches and luxuries would be mine for the ask-
ing my poetry would rival virgils ha such is the
power of thought verily what roman would not have
let his mind run astray in the midst of such super-
geniuses of invention as these new yorkians yea and
i am a roman

  i continued my walk on my left hand were large
castles where one of a select four hundred persons
lived there were four hundred such castles like these
in new york each housing one of this same select four
hundred a short distance away were the towering
dwellings of the more common people the common
people had to live four hundred in one house these
buildings were constructed much the same as ours ex-
cept that they rose to dizzy heights high rents also
prevailed here as in rome

  the streets were filled with long lines of swiftly mov-
ing chariots or carts they were luxurious affairs
gaudy and brilliant in highly polished colors the ex-
pressions on the faces of the occupants bespoke the pride
of their owners again the engine was used to propel
these glorious chariots along the glistening streets in-
stead of the outer edges of the wheels being bound in
hides or leather as are our chariots they were covered
by a smooth-fitting fabric rim these rims contained
air under pressure the fabric was called rubber and
was another wonderful discovery of this land like
the engine it had been put to many uses and because
of its flexibility and water-shedding quality it was of
great value as a cloak in the rain this rubber could
be made either soft or hard and was manufactured into
thousands of different articles for daily use throughout
the united states later on i found that the rubber
was made into little sticks five to a package many
citizens chewed these little sticks as they strolled along
no doubt the idea came from the cow

after a glance around the horizon it was perhaps
natural that i a roman should next be attracted
by new yorks native females yea and what an
attraction

  my friends in rome will vouch that while i have
delved deeply into scientific matters i have with all other
romans not neglected the physical although i was
not considered a connoisseur of women i have had my
little moments for i am a roman i dare say that any
of my fellow countrymen would have been likewise en-
the ice man



thralled should they have witnessed the enchanting crea-
tures that i beheld i must control my emotions as i
write lest i overdo the thing

  the main attraction of these new york ladies was
their style of dress however their faces were also
very beautiful to lookupon when one took occasion to
look but their costumes were the main enticement

  each and every one was clothed in a single short gar-
ment that fell to a point just above the knees just
above the knees  i swear to it this garment was
made of a glossy shimmering fabric and clung to the
shapely bodies as if the owners had just been immersed
in the river and were walking along dripping wet and
slippery the legs of these fair creatures were clothed
in a similar fabric but of much thinner texture that ac-
tually being possible it was like looking through wisps
of wind-blown cobwebs this shimmering fabric was
called silk it was made in various hues and shades and
was truly a godsend to womankind for it was even more
appealing than the nude

  i stood still for a moment my heart filled with rapture
over seeing such a wonderful parade of treasures
these lovely creatures strolled along apparently ignor-
ant of the fact that every movement was clearly defined
by the twitching of the silk i thought of the feast this
sight would be for those friends of mine back in heavily
swathed rome even dusky egypt had nothing like
this

  with a chuckle of glee i thought of you romans hav-
ing to be content with watching the damsels meander
about the forum in their concealing pallas and stolas
ah but here in new york a slight gust showed me
visions above the knee verily the dress of the ladies
was one of the most revealing sights of this great new
york

  my past experience with the fair ladies of rome had
taught me that beauty of the face did not necessarily
continue under the palla here in new york there was
no doubt whatsoever for a man could really trust his
vision

  thinking that i would enjoy the companionship of
one of these fair exhibits i straightway tried to make the
acquaintance of the next beautiful lady who passed to
my surprise my only reward was a baleful glance of
disdain by no means discouraged i approached many
others some even more beautiful than the first but i
was rebuffed at every turn while some of the ladies
did smile and giggle the net result was anything but
complimentary to one who had always considered him-
self a first-rate roman lover

  i reasoned that perhaps my mode of dress was dis-
tasteful to them it must be remembered that i was
dressed in our native roman garb and that i was quite
different in appearance from the rest of the men in new
york although my toga displayed my strong manly
arms to good advantage it was entirely unlike the male
attire of this land the new york male garments were
of an unusual pattern however they were very pleas-
ing to the eye and made a practical mode of dress for
those who rushed about in a great hurry the upper
part of this costume consisted of a short tight-fitting
jacket with long sleeves that entirely concealed the mus-
cles of the arm if there were any the lower portion
of the garment consisted of two long loose tubes that
were joined at the waist they were called pants these
pants were ideal for hiding undeveloped legs as they
gave no hint whatsoever as to what they concealed the

wide effect at the bottom lent a very substantial appear-
ance to the wearer i resolved that i would postpone
my campaign with the ladies until i could procure similar
raiment for myself

  for the first time it struck me as queer that my own
attire had attracted little or no attention there i was
strolling about the streets of new york clad in my na-
tive roman toga with my tunica underneath but all
the attention i aroused was a casual glance here and
there had one of the new yorkers been in the same
position in rome he would have been an object of in-
terest for the multitude but here in this country
where men pay little heed to the dress of their women-
that is compared to my interest-what could be expected
of their notice of a mans garments

  another peculiar thing i noticed at that time was
jtil that most of the men were eating smoke this
smoke was obtained by sucking on a small fire at the
outer end of a short white stick which was carried in the
mouth i later learned that these white sticks contained
a peculiar weed known as tobacco the sticks were
called cigarettes i have since tried to use one of them
myself but the smoke always got in my lungs and
choked me

  evidently the art of eating smoke could be learned in
time for every male in sight had a little cloud of smoke
about his head even the females smoked while riding
in their chariots but my own personal opinion was that
the cigarette had been over-spoken as in rome many
things in new york had secured followers by being
over-spoken they called it advertising in this country

  oh yes another thing all the male citizens wore
odd-shaped helmets they looked like small inverted
bowls and some were folded or creased at the top i did
not particularly notice the ladies headgear however
i distinctly remember that their shoes were pushed up
in the rear on slender peg-like stilts this gave an ap-
pearance of smallness even to large feet

  speaking of the ladies again reminds me that the eyes
of the males were equipped with two small windows
of transparent glass the glass was not unlike our
glass    from which we make our small perfume
flasks    excepting that it was so curved as to magnify
the objects of vision the little windows held in place
by two long hooks that fastened over the ears turned
with the head as the eyes were focused from one lady
to the next this was the reason the men appeared not
to be looking at the ladies only one glance was re-
quired to bring the magnified beauty before their eyes
verily i yearned for a pair of these little windows for
my own use even one or two of the ladies wore the
device although these ladies were of the older type
looking for a desirable husband no doubt

  i next beheld some of new yorks wonderful build-
ings they were of tremendous height and faced close
to the edge of the street nothing will ever stir me as
did my first sight of these colossal structures like
the sheer walls of a mountain defile they towered to un-
believable heights their topmost points seemed to
scrape the clouds ye gods what an awful mess there
would certainly be if one of them ever toppled over

  however as gigantic as the structures were they
lacked the grace and beauty of our roman buildings
there was a marked absence of any columns or arches
their walls were straight and flat though pierced by
many hundreds of windows and the whole unit looked


amazing stories

like a vast pile of stone blocks true there were some
of the low buildings that had a few columns in the front
and here and there a small arch graced an entranceway
but the great majority of them were built on the ugly
egyptian style of the obelisk

  i was glad to see that wt romans were very far in ad-
vance of these new yorkers in the art and the beauty
of architecture

  one or two of the buildings were in the process of
being built and i had an opportunity to discover a group
of marvelous inventions that were in common use in
this land only a few men were at work on the build-
ings but i was able to gather much information from the
large crowd watching the construction the builders
were experts at their trade as the structures were com-
pleted in a very short space of time however the
watchers were also experts and they often argued among
themselves as to whether the workers were doing the
job right or not

  the skeletons of the buildings were made of great
beams of metal known as steel this steel was a metal
similar to our iron in fact iron-ore had been heated
until all impurities and sulphur had passed off then
the exact amount of carbon and other secret ingredients
were added to produce the required strength of steel
the steel was very strong and almost as hard as some
of our copper i was later gratified to learn that we
romans were also far in advance of these new yorkers
in the matter of hardening copper oh there was no
doubt but what these new yorkers had some wonderful
inventions and tricks but i never lost sight of the fact
that we romans had a trick or two ourselves one or
two of the natives did not care to hear about this so i
refrained from bringing it up during the rest of the con-
versation on building

  the great steel beams were lifted into place on the
skeleton-work by flexible steel ropes these ropes were
attached to devices such as our pulley-system and the
pulling was done by another of those engines it ap-
peared that almost everything in new york was made
of steel or rubber and was called a machine and was
run with an engine

  great machines mixed concrete made with our roman
cement and poured it into wood frames built around the
steel beams this method had quite an advantage over
our method of hand-mixing concrete

  we should have been greatly assisted in constructing
our great aqua marica if we had had one of those mix-
ing machines

  one other thing these new yorkers had learned better
than we romans ever did was the art of manufacturing
glass in great sheets i was informed that they rolled
the glass instead of blowing it these immense glass
sheets were placed on the front of the building to keep
the citizens from stealing the various pieces of merchan-
dise on display

  all of a sudden i realized that i had not eaten since
morning professor haskell had given me some food
during the third hour but in the excitement of my escape
and of seeing so many wonderful sights i had forgotten
all about eating again seeing that is was nearly sun-
set or at least the eleventh hour i hunted for a place
where i could purchase food with the paper money from
the professors purse

  my nose soon-directed me to a place from which the
smell of cooking was issuing with a very noticeable and
agreeable aroma

a large sheet of glass covered the front of this
eating place and enabled one to whet his appetite
from watching others eat upon entering i first noticed
a long row of discs that were mounted on short ped-
estals on these discs were perched many citizens and
it reminded me of my pet monkey for the citizens all
sat to eat

  unlike us romans the new yorkers have yet to
learn how much the stomach suffers when one tries to eat
in a seated position some day these people will learn
that a reclining posture when one is dining minimizes
the strain on the organs some day they will learn that
the throat muscles were intended to force the food into
the stomach they will learn of the necessary gland -
fluids that are to be mixed with the food as it slowly
passes along the throat watching their animals eat
would tell them that how these people could stand
the shock of dropping food and drink directly into their
stomachs was more than i could understand what writh
eating while seated and with eating smoke it was no
wonder all new yorkers looked so frail and sickly

  approaching a counter that separated the discs or
stools from the rest of the place i encountered a very
beautiful damsel she wore a fetching blue and white
costume and must have been the proprietress she gave
me a glass of water and a card and with a damp cloth
she wiped a brown stain from off the polished counter
i demanded meat bread and drink    any wine she
might have would do

  the fair lady gave every indication that she thought i
was intoxicated at last my difference of dress was
noticed she asked me if i had not been in a joint
and she wanted to know what kind of a place it was
where they sent a guy home in a sheet my friendly
smile put a stop to any further questions and she
straightway brought forth victuals three or four metal
eating-implements were also served with the food but
i chose to spend no time learning the use of these tools
for i was very hungry besides nothing will ever be
invented that would improve on our good old roman
style of eating with the fingers

  all would have gone well had i not forgotten myself
and tried to recline on the tops of those stools the
discs revolved with lightning speed and i fell to the
floor this act caused me no little discomfiture and
gave reason for considerable mirth to those assembled
my head had received a good sound thump on the stone
floor and i must have staggered a bit when regaining
my perch this settled all doubts of my sobriety in the
minds of my associates

  in a measure my seeming intoxication proved fortu-
nate for the fair attendant or proprietress became very
solicitous regarding my feelings i soon gianed her con-
sent to an invitation to show me the city i told her
that i was a stranger in new york i then quickly
showed her my full purse and thereby overcame her
fears that i had been robbed and was penniless

  she was overjoyed at seeing my great wealth and
she said that i could come back for her after an hour
had passed however she was firm on the point that i
must first purchase suitable new york clothes she
told me to procure them in a place around the corner
on broadway street i was cautioned to remember that
i could find her in this restaurant which was on seventy-
second street she wrote the address down on a piece

of tissue e- restaurant nd and bhvay and

signed her name it was kate
the ice man



  as i stepped outside of the restaurant i beheld one
of the most wonderful sights i had ever seen miracle
of miracles oh what a sight for one who had only
been accustomed to the dark streets of rome at night
here in new york the night-time was brighter than the
day thousands of brightly illuminated globes flooded
the street with light hundreds of these small globes
were grouped in weird scrolls and designs that spelled
out letters each letter flickered off and on in rapid
succession it made me think i had stepped into a
fairyland try to imagine each star in the heavens a
hundred times brighter tint them the colors of the
rainbow arrange them in patterns like the mosaic
of our temple of venus and roma twinkle them on
and off whirl them around like a thousand comets
then my romans you will have a vague conception of
what i witnessed on broadway street at night in this
wonderful city of new york this was called elec-
tricity 

  electricity electricity was that something that
made all of these little globes shine so brightly elec-
tricity was the force that gave these new yorkers light
heat power music    everything that was wonderful
ah but what it was and even whence it came not one
citizen in all the land could tell nor did anyone know
all they knew was that they had it    that they could
put it to work i know that this will sound very silly
to all romans for we romans will never rest until
we have solved every perplexing mystery but such
was the state of ignorance of the strange people in this
very strange land

i entered the clothing establishment which kate
had told me i would find it was maintained by an
israelite with both hands he sold me an outfit such as
i desired it was called a nifty suit i was also sup-
plied with the new york type of footgear and under
garments i was delightfully surprised with my appear-
ance in the large mirror that the israelite had strategi-
cally placed near his cash box how i wished that my
countrymen could have seen me

  kate was also delighted with my costume when i re-
turned for her at the restaurant she spoke of me as
being her warm daddy almost everything had some
sort of heated temperature in this new york

  kate further remarked that i looked swell although
i could not see that my new costume had made me look
any fatter i later learned that most of kates language
was very different from the english i had learned from
professor haskell the real new york language was
full of tricks and i soon learned that the professor had
out-traded me instead of teaching me the native new
york tongue in exchange for my information on the
things of rome he had taught me a foreign language
however if i raised my eyebrows the new yorkers
were able to understand me but i could not comprehend
one-half of the things they said

  other languages have many words with the same
meaning but this new york tongue had many meanings
for the same word their word can was a good ex-
ample this word can could mean to be able to
do a small bucket to discharge one from his job an
automobile the act of preserving a mens retreat the
head as when one was off his can the middle rear
as when one was knocked on his can dismissal of
ones sweetheart to rush the purchase of beer to tor-
ment a dog and as an oil-can it could mean either

an oil-container or just as easily ones brother-in-law

  kate also spoke the language of the eyes and in this
art she was a fluent speaker her eyebrows were little
penciled lines but they made up in movement what they
lacked in hair

  kate led me to a commercial chariot called a taxi
riding in it was like skimming through the air while one
sat on a bed our roman chariots are very poor riding
compared to these smooth-running taxis we were
very fortunate in having selected the one taxi in all
new york that had the right-of-way privilege over
everybody else after pushing aside one or two other
chariots that would not recognize this authority we
arrived at one of the brightest places i have ever seen it
was the place where forty-second street made a crossing
on broadway street kate said that it was the times
square but i thought that it had been tnany times
divided

  kate enjoyed my amazement over the bright lights
she stood off at a little distance so that i could look
my fill taking me by the arm she then led me to an
even brighter spot-the brilliant dazzling white entrance
to one of new yorks cathedrals of amusement

  a soldier of high rank guarded the entranceway of
this gorgeous cathedral he wore an elegant uniform
and must have been of the rank of general harkea unto
me noble romans during the night would be an ideal
time to capture this country as all of the soldiers are
placed on guard in these amusement halls they are so
placed to hold the citizens in awe so that each and every
one will line up and pay the admission toll

  all of the art and beauty that the new yorkers had
omitted from their tall buildings had been lavishly ap-
plied to the interior of their amusement cathedrals they
are on a par with our roman interiors just inside the
doorway stood two or three soldiers of the ranks they
were dressed in uniforms of brilliant hue and they stood
quite stiff lest they wrinkle their garments stationed
around the hall were many more of these soldiers they
had no lances or spears but one could readily see from
the expression on their faces that they would not be con-
quered without giving strenuous battle however as
they were such small sickly looking soldiers i believe
that i could have conquered a dozen of them at one time

  magnificent tapestries covered the high walls these
tapestries were made of the silk material and figured
with golden dragons whose serpentine bodies shimmered
and gleamed in the many-colored lights a gorgeous
carpet covered the entire floor and this too was fash-
ioned with golden dragons which seemed to glare at me
with fiery eyes as i stepped deep into their soft bodies
huge vases and odd pieces of furniture with dragons
feet stood at intervals along the walls great lamps
that looked like suspended waterfalls hung from the
domed ceiling one was swayed with the colossal
luxury and lavish grandeur of the place and i had a
feeling of being smothered in gorgeousness i was in
a place called the movies

  kate and i were finally led to seats in a dark audi-
torium on one wall facing the seats was a large pic-
ture why all the fancy trimmings for only a big black-
in our seats i wondered why all of the lavish art dis-
play had been made on the outside of the auditorium
why could they not have put some inside with the pic-
ture why all the fancy trimmings for only a big black-
and-white picture  and then i saw i heard

  the figures in the painting moved    they came to


amazing

stories

life    they talked   and it was only a picture again
that breath-taking fright of the supernatural swept over
me i swear on my honor as a roman citizen that i
was fully conscious when i witnessed this miracle not
only did the figures in the painting move and talk but
the picture grew dim and faded into another new scene
still other scenes appeared more figures came forth   
until a whole story was unfolded

  i could not explain this mystery any more than i
could explain electricity it was a form of amusement
whose origin was a secret the citizens were allowed to
look at the picture only while it moved when the ac-
tion ceased a curtain was dropped in front of the paint-
ing a squadron of musicians was pushed up from
the cellar to keep people from mounting the stage lest
they discover the secret of the moving and talking within
the painting

soon afterwards a new painting appeared and
showed citizens playing ball a game very similar to
our roman pastime the only difference was that the
new yorkers played on a diamond plot instead of on a
tviangle and they used twelve players at one time instead
of our three however three of the players were
dressed in blue uniforms and seemed to be the best play-
ers of the lot for they kept telling the others what to
do to improve their game one selfish player in the
center who probably owned the ball made all the rest
wait until he felt like playing naturally the other play-
ers did not get very much exercise

  i noticed that one player carried a stick for hitting
the ball but at the time the picture was painted this
fellow with the club was a poor selection he could
not send the ball to the rest of the players he even
knocked the ball over the fence finally in anger he
ran all around the plot and quit the witnesses jeered
him on to a little hole in the wall they teased him by
calling him a big baby they also called him ruth
a feminine name

  after the ball-game painting faded out the lights
flared up and i had to release kate from my embrace
we left the auditorium

  kate proved to be a really wonderful girl she seemed
to have caught the spirit of the occasion for she tried
to show me everything that she thought i would consider
unusual or mystifying i had informed her that i was
not acquainted with many things in new york which
were common affairs to anyone else she had deduced
this in advance and thought it not unusual as i had re-
cently arrived from rome she said that there were
many strangers and foreigners in new york in fact
she had personally met many of my own countrymen
who had been in this land for some time and who were
then in the fruit and shoe-polishing profession kate
like the professor spoke of knowing all about our city
of rome and declared that our citizens were well known
here in new york she admitted that they all were in
need of knowledge for most of them were struck
dumb with the strange sights they had beheld she
said that all romans were called wops

  i secured her promise that on the morrow i could
meet these fellow romans undoubtedly they were
some of our sailors whom we had given up as lost over
the great edge of the sea i cannot blame them for
not wanting to return to rome after having discovered
this wonderful united states and new york city it
would be a very attractive port for any sailor what

with these new york ladies parading around the streets
dressed in their swaddling clothes together with all of
the wonder of this strange land it would have been
very easy for a roman sailor to forget that he had a
wife back home especially would it be so when he
knew that the wife believed him lost at sea

  stopping in front of a brightly lighted shop kate
asked me if i would like to talk over the telephone and
listen to a phonograph and radio i assured her that
such was my fondest desire for i had visions of our
entering another darkened auditorium where kate could
again snuggle close in my arms however the darkened
retreat was not forthcoming as she instead guided me
into a brightly lighted shop

  inside the shop were many boxes and cabinets in
one of these boxes i found the telephone it was a
large cupboard-like box and contained a small electrical
device by which one could converse with another at a
great distance calling in a loud voice was unnecessary
for one could plainly hear and speak in a normal tone
i distinctly heard a feminine voice ask me for a number
but before i could think of one she selected another
persons offering to perform her trick and told me to
retire as she was busy there was considerable buzzing
going on in the bell-shaped ear-piece but this noise
would no doubt be soon eliminated and one would be
able to converse over a busy wire without disturbance
if they were quick in selecting a number kate informed
me that the ladys voice i had heard was many miles away
and had been carried by electricity over two small metal
wires there was no way of proving this statement at
the time but i will say that i looked behind the cup-
board and found no one hiding

  as i came from the telephone box kate showed
me another much smaller box it was the radio again
i heard voices this time there was a man singing to
his mother in a sad voice he cried for her like a calf
it was a very good imitation but the music was very
poor and uneven most of the notes were off key and
very flat however this was to be expected kate said
as the radio was a new invention and not fully de-
veloped at that time like the telephone the voice and
music were carried over the same distance but with radio
there were no wires strung along the way kate said
that the noise or music was hurled through the air by
electricity and caught by the radio in the shop the
man who owned the shop said that the radio was in
tune with the sending equipment again i had to take
their word for it but my personal opinion was that the
things were very much out of tune

  kate was a master conjurer and took delight in point-
ing out a third box in which the music had been caught
and stored up for future hearing i know that my fellow
romans are thinking that i am a great liar when i tell
of such seemingly impossible things as these i assure
everyone that the actual devices were before me and per-
formed just as i have stated however i am at a loss
to tell how they worked and i believe that neither kate
nor the shop-man could have done much explaining
had i been able to question them at any length

  i myself hardly believed in the last mechanical box
the phonograph but the shopkeeper convinced me be-
yond all doubt with a fourth box he called this last
device a dictaphone he requested me to speak a few
words in the attached tube he then made a certain
mystic motion with his hands and lo    i again heard
my own voice speak from the box and say the word i
the ice man



had already spoken verily i heard my voice speak the
very same words over and over again he told me that
a thousand years hence my voice would continue repeat-
ing the words from the box even though i would be
long since dead ah my romans this was indeed a
very strange land of very strange people who had very
strange boxes the dictaphone which captured my
voice was the greatest thing of all i could listen to it
for hours

   i would have stayed and better examined this marvel-
ous dictaphone but kate in her characteristic new
york rushing manner led me outside the shop she said
that i had not seen anything compared to what she had
yet to show me she referred to more new york in-
ventions for she was then wearing the typical new
york dress

  under her guidance we came upon a large hole in the
street it was covered with a hood-like canopy and was
the entrance to an ingenious subterranean chariot-train
called the subway

  we sped down the brightly illuminated steps of this
hole until i thought we surely must have reached the
realm of hades at a very low level we came upon a
great open place on either side in deep channels i
saw swiftly moving trains made up of many wheeled
chariots they were much longer than the taxi and
traveled at terrific speed i had thought we were to
watch their operation but before i knew what had hap-
pened we were thrust inside of one that had quickly
stopped at our feet in an instant we were whisked
away in the darkness i had become quite fond of kate
by this time and trusted her implicitly but nevertheless
my heart was riding in my mouth during the entire
journey underground

felt a sudden change of atmosphere and kate told
me that we were traveling under the bed of a river
under the bed of east river we were boring our path
i could hardly believe it great ships wrere plowing
their way on the surface of the river above as we rushed
through the darkness under the water the roar of the
train wheels was deafening on the ears but i liked it
for kate swayed close to my side and gave me reassur-
ing squeezes on the arm the inside of the train was
wrell lighted and very pleasant except that most of
the passengers had been eating garlic and had neglected
to chew their cloves

   leaving the train at a place called atlantic station
we immediately boarded another this new train ran
underground for a while and then emerged to the sur-
face and thence to a high level built upon steel stilts
the train was no longer called the subway it was to be
known as the elevated while it ran on the stilts i was
much happier to be nearer to heaven than to hades i
hoped that the attendant up front would not forget how
to steer

  in about one-half hour we had traveled what would
have been a days journey in rome soon we came upon
the city of coney island even at that time i could
hardly believe that i had been set free only that morning
i had traveled many miles unto a new city and had seen
the most marvelous things of my life and the hour was
only half-after ten by the new york reckoning as kate
remarked the evening was young yet and i aint
seen nothin yet

   coney island was a gorgeous dream city that had been
especially built for the encouragement of young couples

in love it proved to be an ideal place for one to become
intimately acquainted with his fair lady however
kate and i hardly required any stimulant to promote
our congeniality for i had long since marveled over
how quickly we had come to know and understand
each others feelings during the short time we had been
together only a few hours past we had not known of
each others existence but our close companionship
through those short adventure-seeking hours had bound
us together like friends and lovers of long standing
our unrestrained emotions bursting forth as we dis-
covered new adventures at every turn had opened our
hearts and torn down the usual barricade of poise one
generally affects when in company with one of the op-
posite sex it was surprising how quickly a stranger
could meet and become an intimate friend of a new york
lady nevertheless i found that our coney island
visit added strength to our mutual bond and we both felt
as if we had known each other since birth

  during the hour that we toured the city of coney
island i saw so many marvelous sights and strange de-
vices that my head was muddled in a myriad of dancing
electric lights amidst hundreds of hot-meat vendors and
countless squawking advertisers of gambling

  one thing i will never forget was our many rides on
breath-taking death-defying devices that were known as
coasters these coasters were built up on high stilts
oh much higher than the elevated stilts they were
also built down deep like the subway their paths
continually dropped from high pinnacles to deep
ravines below it was as if the builders had not
been able to make up their minds as to what they were
trying to construct subway or elevated

  the principle of the coaster was that each man pas-
senger had to clutch his woman companion tightly as
she squealed in fright on the top of each hill a long
dark tunnel had been conveniently placed on a nice level
stretch at the base of the last hill by the time the tunnel
was reached the male escort had become well acquainted
with his fair ladys outline it seems needless to report
that when we found ourselves shot into the tunnel in
close embrace we straightway eliminated any further de-
lay of our inevitable kiss in fact we made up for any
time that might have been lost i want to say right
here that even though kates words usually were only
short meaningless ejaculations i felt that she possessed
an eloquence of expression such as i had never attained
in any of my many-worded speeches in rome when she
concluded each kiss with her oh daddy

  the coaster was a wonderful invention

   later kate gleefully introduced me to another united
states or new york wronder-box it was a device that
required only an instant to paint ones likeness it was
called the photograph it was the most wonderful box
of all the boxes    even more wonderful than the dic-
taphone

   kate and i were led to a seat in a toy airplane while
an attendant made some little movements over his box-
device in less time than it takes me to write he sup-
plied us with six miniature paintings that were most ex-
act in detail and likeness nowhere have i ever seen such
marvelous work nothing will ever equal the lightning
speed with which we were painted all my life i had
longed for a portrait of myself but never did i think
i would become rich or famous enough to have my de-
sire fulfilled the six paintings from the wonderful
photograph-box i gave to kate for safe-keeping thev


amazing stories

were by far the greatest inventions of all this invention-
blessed land

  during the return journey to new york we found the
subway to be considerably less crowded and we were
able to ride in seats i had not noticed that there were
seats on the first trip kate snuggled to my side and
allowed her head to droop on my shoulder i reasoned
that she had at last become tired and sleepy and i had
visions of our retiring to her abode but in this i was
mistaken for we had no sooner reached times square
station than she was up on her feet bubbling over with
new enthusiasm and lust for adventure what stamina
these new york ladies possessed

  we hailed a passing taxi and entered its passenger
compartment to settle in the deep luxury of the seats
kate directed the driver to take us out lenox avenue
to one-hundred and thirty-fifth street i had become
so acclimated to being ridden swiftly hither and yon
in new york that the taxis high speed no longer thrilled
me however i found a new and better thrill could be
had in a taxi it was a marvelous place in which one
could promote unrestricted love-making with ones fair
lady while flying through the main streets of new
york the coaster had taught us to make the most of
every opportunity likewise most of new yorks
citizens must have been in the same mood for i noticed
that every taxi we passed contained occupants similarly
entwined i gleefully thought of how it would appear
in rome if all men tried to caress their maidens while
riding along the forum in chariots however it was
surprising how quickly one could travel while engaged
in this artful occupation just when things were be-
coming interesting we were interrupted by arriving at
our destination

  after we alighted kate told me that she was taking
me to a place called a night club it seemed that any
strangers evening in new york was not complete with-
out a concluding night club visit i was willing to fol-
low kate unto the last last adventure wherever she
chose to lead for the promise in her eyes was such as
one sees when the trail is near the end my only fear
was that the professors fast diminishing purse would
not stand the strain much longer

  the night club proved to be a very large restaurant
in which many citizens and their ladies were having
little feasts at secluded independent tables a squad
of african musicians furnished weird barbaric notes
from odd-shaped trumpets and a large drum the noise
beat upon the ears with stimulating rhythm and seemed
to have a hilarious effect upon everyone present a
chorus of sparsely dressed ethiopian females were ex-
ecuting fantastic dance steps and body wiggles in a little
open place between the tables the free spirit of con-
geniality together with the intoxicating music steeled
everyone to a high pitch this tempo was undoubtedly
necessary to assist one in downing the liquid these new
yorkers had to drink the drink was called hootch and
it had to be diluted with a portion of mineral water and
lemon juice before one dared place it in ones mouth
it was always drunk in a single quaff or gulped down as
speedily as possible lest ones grimaces became perma-
nent i think the stuff was made from this unknown
thing they called electricity

  i longed to show these new yorkers our roman art
of sipping drinks but after drinking my first glass of
hootch i too realized that their method of gulping was
for the best

as the evening sped along into the last hours of night
i felt as if a veil had been lifted from my eyes the
lights seemed to have brightened in color the dancing
figures seemed to have more animation and less raiment
on their bodies as they floated across the floor everything
seemed to be toned into a beautiful harmonious blend
and kates ravishing beauty seemed more vivid than ever
as she openly kissed me across the table i realized that
we had had many drinks of hooch and although i was
not in any sense drunk i certainly was pleased with the
outlook on life in this wonderful new york and the
united states however i decided to control my thirst
lest i became totally intoxicated and would be unable to
survive the climax of a most wonderful evening

  oh what a climax it was when it finally came upon
us it was nothing like what i had expected the bright-
ness of the evening was immediately snuffed out
tragedy crossed the dance floor in the form of a power-
fully built ethiopian who made some slurring remark
to kate this was the beginning of the end

  quick as a flash i was upon the slave he must have
underestimated my condition for he was unprepared for
my onslaught and i quickly and easily lifted him over
my head and hurled him through the air he crashed
with terrific force upon the startled musicians and
scattered them and their rigging to the four winds this
action brought forth screams of terror from all the
ladies and chaos reigned throughout the hall from
that time on i was busily engaged in battle in a short
space of time i had piled up an amazing heap of humanity
on the musicians platform verily i would have con-
quered all of my enemies had they not brought into play
another insidious new york invention called the gat
or pistol before this new weapon i went down in de-
feat

  these pistols or gats were diabolical things of steel
they were short compact little devices that spat forth
flame and fire and sent lead pellets hurtling through the
air without these weapons one was helpless i sank
to the floor writhing in agony three or four pistols
had used my body as a target i had a vague recollection
of some new york ushers or cops appearing upon the
scene but at that point i fell into a swoon

  upon awakening i found myself again a prisoner
for a while i was in a hospital but i was later trans-
ferred to a cell in the new york jail at first my
wounds were very painful and i feared that i should
die before i could again see kate however my strong
well-kept body soon healed and i was ready to depart
but the cops insisted that i remain in my cell and there
i languished for three months

  while awaiting my release i had the opportunity
to observe and study two more marvels of this land
they were paper and printing

  the paper was similar to our liber like our pugil-
lares it was made of wood and was in common use but
it was very different from these pugillares which were
only wax-coated slabs of wood the paper was the re-
sult of boiling wood until it became a pulp and then
pressing this mass into thin sheets it was as enduring
as our papyrus from egypt and after it had dried out
thoroughly one could fold or bend the stuff without hav-
ing it crack or become brittle

  none of the paper came in rolls but instead was bound
in little small leafed booklets on the paper was the
other invention called printing it was a quick way to
make many copies of the same writing
the ice man



  this printing was accomplished by using large em-
bossed plates similar to our coins these plates were
coated with an ink-fluid and lightly touched on the
paper with a machine the resulting impression was
printing long speeches and even paintings were pro-
duced in this manner during my stay in the jail i had
ample opportunity to read many books and news bul-
letins

  my association with my fellow prisoners has given
me a thought that i believe will be helpful to you romans
when you demand my immediate release from listen-
ing to the conversation of the men about me i learned
the names of some of the prominent men in this country
knowing that a messenger will be dispatched with all
haste as soon as this report reaches rome i am giving
the names of the men most spoken of so that it will be
known to whom the order of release should be addressed
gene tunney cal hornsby babe a smith lindy
hoover jack dempsey and will rogers

  after three months in jail i was given a trial such
a trial as it was it was just a foolish pretense of jus-
tice the sole object being to have all concerned establish
themselves as public speakers of great renown i was
not allowed to even make a speech one blustering citi-
zen made some highly insulting remarks about my men-
tality i took immediate offense and grappled him about
the throat but the cops sprang to his rescue and i was
forced to listen in silence upon his word alone i was
sent back to my cell he called me the ice man and
said many other things which i will not repeat lest rome
declare war with this country i was merely the ball
in a game i was tossed back and forth from cell to
court while the lawyers and some citizens called alien-
ists were enabled to show their skill at the pastime

  throughout the trial i made vain efforts to establish
my identity but was repulsed at every turn finally
i was judged insane and committed to an asylum i
am now in this asylum called b- while here im-
prisoned i have written this report in the hope that it
will in some way reach you romans and that my release
will be speedily effected i advise you to send a large
army with the messenger for these new yorkers are
very obstinate in their views and say that you romans
are a dead race of people

  i will bide my time and await the coming of a likely
looking visitor to whom i must intrust the delivery of
this report

signed

marcus publius

ps i have not heard from kate since the disastrous
climax in the night club i fear that she was mortally
wounded for i know that she would have appeared at
the trial to help prove my sanity one of my associates
in the jail thought that she was in the gold-digging
business i pray that she is alive and is out digging this
gold so that she will soon have enough to purchase my
release otherwise i must wait and hope that this report
finds its way to my countrymen

  authors note again we remark that some may
question marcus publius sanity and our action in se-
curing his release from the insane asylum but lest
someone also question the sanity of the author himself
it must be remembered that out of the large sum he re-
ceived for this work the reader has helped to defray a

f

rom the days of superstition when the sud-
den appearance of a new star portended the
birth of a great man or a terrible destruction
by war and plague up to the present time
when these phenomena are studied with tele-
scope and spectroscope the brilliant flashing bursts of
novae continue to interest mankind

  professor kepling hesitated and glanced suspiciously
over his class it was a warm afternoon-langorously
warm i yawned and looked at my frat brother jim
turner we had been to the same dance the night be-
fore and i was wondering if he would manage to fight
off the tendency to go to sleep as well as i was doing so
far to my surprise jim wras leaning forward eagerly
drinking in every word i remembered then that he was
a sort of bug on astronomy nursing a hopeless wish
that he had been born a century or two later so that he
might travel to other worlds i shrugged my shoulders
as the cultured voice of the gray-haired professor droned
on

  history has recorded many instances of the appear-
ance of novse but the first one to be studied by a mind
more scientifically than superstitiously inclined wras ob-
served by tycho on the evening of november  
it seems that in going toward his home on that night the
celebrated danish astronomer saw people standing out in
the streets staring and pointing at the sky directly over-
head wrhere he was astonished to see an unknown star
of surpassing brilliance the new star even outshone
the planet jupiter in fact there was not another star
in the whole heavens that could be compared to it

  he had of course only imperfect instruments with
which to study it but with these he determined as best he
could its exact location and faithfully followed its sub-
sequent changes it kept on brightening until at last it
even shone in the daytime finally however it began to
fade turning red as it did so in march it disappeared
from the interested astronomers searching sight and has
never been seen since

  my eyelids were getting heavy i jerked them open
determined to get the points of the lecture for i knew

done by astronomers in recent years
timely the author has undoubtedly
work for he offers in some sections of
treatment of the stars and novce the
of interplanetary travel that shows a
and good writing we recommend it
for their careful consideration

by jims fascinated stare that he would be raring to go
for a good discussion as soon as the bell rang

  there have been others of less brilliance the well-
modulated tones droned on but the next famous nova
occurred on the evening of february   an
amateur astronomer in edinburgh wras the first man to
see the new star blazing in the constellation of perseus
he telegraphed the news over the world luckily the
heavens had been photographed on february th and
the spot where the star now shone showed no trace in
the photograph

  within a few hours of its discovery however it was
ablaze-outshining capella and exceeding first magni-
tude but like a terrible conflagration it burned only a
few days and then began to die away with a red glow
its light diminishing and then flaring up again spasmodi-
cally every few days though none of these revivals
equalled the splendor of the first outburst finally it
died away to ninth magnitude

  this time however there was a sequel to the story
some six months later photographs showed that this
star was now surrounded by a spiral nebula which spread
from it like an expanding wave four condensations
seemed to -gather in this fiery ring and revolve about the
main nucleus of sun but in time these condensations
faded from sight and the nova became only a faintly
nebulous star of less than ninth magnitude

i caught myself nodding and straightened quickly
if only that man could speak more roughly but the
combination of late hours and a lulling voice was liable
to get me yet   

  the question naturally arises-how do these terrible
conflagrations come about in answer several theories
have been advanced the first one proposed was that
two suns traveling in opposite directions through the
uncharted realms of space had collided a direct head-on
collision would of course be rather rare though quite
possible but novae are not rare spectacles every year
the telescope brings us the tale of more novae even
though most of them are at far too great a distance to be
seen with the naked eye

                                              j i checked my startled movement with an ef-
                                              fort and turned slowly only to gasp with amaze-
                                              ment for the thing which glowed just beyond
                                              the circle of life    was one of the most gro-
                                              tesque features that could be conceived

let us suppose however that some of these suns -	suppose that each should come close enough for the tidal

stead of actually colliding with each other simply pass a	pull of the other to tear open its photospheric envelope

little too close large bodies such as suns are extremely	the result would be that the incandescent central masses

dangerous to each other they have terrible tidal pulls	would collide like two terrific clashing waves of fire




amazing stories

  a second theory advanced by seeliger of munich
was that a collision between a blazing star or sun and a
vast dark nebula or swarm of meteors-remnants of
some destroyed system-would cause such a spectacle as
a nova presents thistheory underwent modifications
from others until it was finally proposed that a dark or
burnt-out sun plunging into a swarm of meteors would
have its dead surface heated to incandescence and if the
sun was of vast size it would then appear as a new star

  a third theory supposed that a huge dark star had
struck a sun surrounded by planets and that each succes-
sive rekindling of the blaze was the running down of a
new unfortunate planet

  in a fourth theory however the french astronomer
janssen discards all collision theories and puts forward
the idea of an explosion of the sun caused by chemical
changes within the sun itself if oxygen exists in the
suns chromosphere and we know that it does then
should the temperature tend to drop to a critical point
the combination of oxygen and hydrogen would cause a
terrific explosion we know that the temperature of our
own sun keeps varying from day to day it makes us
shudder to think what would happen if our sun should be
suddenly transformed into such a laboratory

  jim was leaning forward with strained attention i
didnt blame him those last words made me glance al-
most involuntarily at a shaft of sunlight which was
lazily streaming across the floor    the soft voice
continued

  in any event we can imagine a terrific flash blinding
all human sight forever and then within ten minutes a
wave of all-enveloping flame   

  i glanced back at the lazy yellow shaft of sunlight-
but this time my eyelids drooped in spite of me as i
heard the lulling voice droning on from a greater and
greater distance finally i shook off the tendency to
doze and opened my eyes the first thing which they
fell upon was the lazy shaft of sunlight somehow it
looked different i rubbed my eyes and stared again
there was certainly something queer about the color but
when i touched jims sleeve he only shook me off im-
patiently i did not have long to puzzle over it however
when the bell rang and jim fairly leapt over the space
between us grabbing my arm and jerking me to my feet

  what a lecture but what do you think caused the
nebulous ring and the condensations 

  dont know i murmured as we pressed out past the
other students into the hall but i do know that i was
sleepy i had to fairly fight myself and that in spite of
the interesting facts of the lecture

  you would he laughed but what a sight that
would be from a ring-side seat

  might have an uncomfortable resemblance to those
warm regions some of us are supposed to visit sometime
without the wishing

  but joking aside bob that would put a sure and
sudden end to our little planetary system wouldnt it
he laughed

  by the way i remarked as casually as possible
doesnt the sun look a little peculiar

  jim snorted

  so old kepling has you worried 

  i mean it i didnt go to lab yesterday so im asking
you if there is some unusual atmospheric condition such
as a big fire somewhere near that would cast an ash veil
it just looks-well-strange

  then the trouble is with your eyes if you took a sip

from browns hip flask last night i would advise you to
lay off

  we walked the rest of the way toward the house in
silence i did not have a class for the rest of the day
but jim i remembered had mentioned a quiz in calculus
finally on the porch i touched his arm

  i suppose you will be studying instead of playing a
set of tennis with me as usual

  no the quiz has been called off

  called off

  yep somebody stole the questions

holy cats whod be fool enough to do a thing like
that somebody doesnt care much about his diploma
dont know lots of things have been disappearing
around the laboratories kenny says that it is a ghost
well hes kind of nutty anyway i suppose that he
claims to have seen it

  yes he did he says that he came upon something
silverish and shining the other day hanging over the
botany microscopes and that the thing which he could
see right through just faded out when he came into the
room

  well whoever heard of a ghost taking up its residence
in a scientific laboratory and stealing calculus questions 
evidently my eyes are not the only ones around this
place that are in need of an examination

it was well toward midnight that evening when i next
saw jim then he came bursting into my room with
his eyes fairly popping out of his head

  you remember what i told you about the calculus
questions he asked when he could get his breath
yeah i yawned

  well i cant tell you about it but you must come with
me right away keplings in his office waiting for you
say now listen i dont know anything about those
questions besides that i dont take calculus

  oh dry up no one is accusing you kepling isnt
a mathematician

  all right i grinned with better humor i suppose
its about the ghost then

  for all my teasing however the information that i
could get out of jim as to why kepling had sent for me
was extremely unsatisfactory i simply had to smother
my curiosity and follow my friend in silence as he made
his way past the night watchman and through the dark-
ened halls of the science building to where the light shone
through the transom of keplings office

  come in answered the cultured voice behind the
door in response to jims knock

  did you see it again doc my friends voice in-
quired anxiously as he stepped through the doorway in
front of me

  the silver hair of keplings head tossed in a negative
answer as he turned around in the glow of the student
lamp that streamed down upon him and motioned us to a
seat

  mr hunt looking from jims anxious face to my
puzzled one i asked mr turner here to bring me his
most trusted friend but to give him no information as to
why he had been summoned

  he was mum all right i grunted hardly realizing in
that moment the great compliment which jim had
paid me

  he told me that he had already informed you about
the strange presence which seems to have been hovering
about this science building for some time
the man from space



  i nodded silently

  he also told me that he had informed you about
the main irregularities that have been discovered

  i nodded again wondering what the man was driv-
ing at

  it was not until tonight that i saw the creature in
fact we both saw it mr turner was discussing the
subject of novse with me here at my desk-and in
particular the most interesting nova persei i had just
been sketching the star with its nebula and the conden-
sations in illustrating what is to my belief a theory of
planetary conception when we were disturbed by the
feeling that we were not alone glancing up we were
both somewhat startled to see a tall shining indescribable
thing before us

  i put out my hand and touched it

  my fingers were resisted by a soft damp or clammy
substance which moved away sharply under my hand as
if that touch had hurt it though the movement of my
hand was exceedingly gentle

  it is my belief now that the creature would un-
doubtedly have tried to get into communication with us
if i had not taken the initiative instead it faded from
our astonished sight-leaving the room absolutely
empty

  but surely sir you do not believe   

  that it was a ghost no but i do believe that we
are entertaining an extra-terrestrial visitor

  you mean i gasped a thrill creeping coldly up my
spine you mean a man from    space

  yes

  but why

  because of the strange composition of the creature in
the first place its method of locomotion and its ability
to fade from sight in the second place i would say
because of the interest which it takes in such things as
microscopes astronomy charts calculus questions and my
poor drawings of nova persei

  i nodded slowly

  cast here among the creatures of an unknown civiliza-
tion this being is just as cautious as curious and as
half-frightened as we would be in similar circumstances
did it look man-like i asked thoughtfully

  no not at all but that does not mean that it lacks
intelligence remember that we are entirely the product
of our own planet from our lung capacity to the pressure
which we can bear upon our bodies then take note of
all the types of life which this single earth has evolved
we are forced to the conclusion that nature is very
generous with her patterns by the law of averages
alone we would probably search far among types of
life on other planets for a pattern just like ours

  of course i hadnt thought of that

  but lets figure out a plan doc jims voice put in
impatiently

  yes what shall wre do about it i asked i was
never very long on the arguments that was jims
strong point mine was action and here he was voic-
ing my sentiments

  i have not outlined a very definite plan   kepling
began

  suppose jim and i catch it

  the white hair tossed a quick negative

  such a proceeding wrould not only destroy all the
confidence which it has gained by watching us but wrould
be liable to be highly dangerous as well because we do
not know what weapons it might have

i nodded regretfully it was good advice but i
couldnt help wishing that he hadnt thought of that

  besides he continued i have an odd feeling that
this thing may know the secret of invisibility thought-
reading or possibly the fourth dimension in fact young
gentlemen when dealing with extra-terrestrial intelli-
gence we must expect to meet with something beyond
or undiscovered by our present knowledge-limit for we
are but the ignorant offspring of our own planet and
once out of that pale we are adrift on an unknown sea

  then what shall we do i asked

  in view of the fact that this being was attracted by
our little discussion of nova persei i propose that we
continue the talk and further it by more charts and draw-
ings possibly this will bring him back

  but after he gets here i persisted

  we will attempt to communicate with him

  i nodded slowly noting that the doors were closed
kepling had said something about the fourth dimension
i looked at jim skeptically but his eyes were on the old
professor and he seemed to have forgotten my presence
utterly in that rapt mood which i had seen come over
him so often during an interesting lecture

  it wont be hard for me to talk about nova persei
for that is one of my hobbies just as novse are one of
my special fields of research perhaps it will become
more fixed in your mind if i point it out on our large
chart while the action of so doing may also serve the
double purpose of attracting our strange visitor

  adjusting his glasses kepling peered through some
charts scattered over his desk and selected one of the
largest unrolling it slowly and running one thin sensi-
tive finger along the milky way

  here it is in the constellation of perseus he nodded
the finger stopping over a dot and then dropping back to
another dot

  this is argol you remember my lecture on argol
sometimes called the demon sunbecause of the huge
planet that eclipses its full light at regular intervals

  i nodded recalling the interesting discussion that jim
had hurled at me right after that lecture

  the ancients thought of course that argol winked-
in fact   

  the sensitive finger curled up from the chart and the
white head was raised slightly as if listening    then
suddenly i noticed a strange silvery light that seemed to
shine on the wall above the desk over the shaded portion
of the student lamp

  slowly    turn slowly kepling warned meas i
started to whirl around in response to that instinct which
made one search immediately for the cause of an unex-
plained fact remember it must not be frightened away
again

  i checked my startled movement with an effort and
turned slowly only to gasp in amazement for the thing
which glowed just beyond the circle of light rays from
the lamp was one of the most grotesque creatures that
one could conceive it stood perhaps seven feet high-or
rather i should say floated because apparently it had
no method of support but moved as if our atmosphere
had been so much heavy liquid like one of those beau-
tiful self-luminous denizens of the deep seas it glinted
with a faint silvery light its nine tentacles hanging down
like a drooping flower whose long faintly-waving petals
faded out into shadow at the same moment i was
aware of a strange heavy perfume that seemed to sud-
denly fill the air of the little room and engulf me like
amazing stories

flashing in a trillion sparkles jhejwave of white-hot gas was reaching for the first planet


the man from space



a tidal wave from the sea i put out a hand to touch
jims sleeve to warn him about that peculiar odor but
my arm seemed to become unbearably heavy it dropped
limply back to my side jim leaning forward in his
chair the white head of kepling lit by the streaming
rays of the student lamp and the silvery thing which
floated just beyond the circle of light all became fixed
like figures of wax or the sketches of a madman on an
illumined canvas and then suddenly swam together in a
crazy whirl as i fell forward into the dark pit of
unconsciousness

  it must have been days before i again came to per-
haps because of my unexpected movement i received
more of the mysterious drug than either of my two
companions at any rate when i next opened my eyes
their anxious faces were bending over me i glanced
at them and smiled when suddenly i caught sight of our
strange surroundings and the smile faded into an ex-
pression of wonder

  yes we looked the same way when we first glanced
around jim grinned

  but  

  see doc he is getting interested i said he would
come around all right

  the coming around isnt the point in question  i
answered sitting up and staring at the glass palace sur-
rounding us-my eyes roving from the lustrous silver
mattress-like rug upon whose tufted fibers of moon-lit
cobwebs i had been resting to the glowing draperies
above our heads that twined backwards like so much
gossamer-thin spun glass glistening as they moved in
an unfelt breeze

  doc thinks that the machinery which propels her is
up there but we cant find any way of getting up jim
volunteered

  my eye dropped back down the sheer glass-like walls
which glowed with the same weird silvery light that our
visitor had emitted in the office of dr kepling

  but how in   

  we know nothing more than you do the cultured
voice of the old projessor assured me we were also
drugged in the office we both saw you fall but were
already powerless ourselves during our state of uncon-
sciousness we were evidently kidnaped

  he niight have invited us to go i grunted resent-
fully i have a notion to smear him up

  that would be most unwise kepling said quickly
in the first place he has not harmed us and in the
second place even if you should succeed in overpowering
him with his strange drugs we have not the remotest
chance of getting back to earth

  you mean that we are in space right now-off the
earth

  exactly

  and this is a space-ship 

  nothing else but jim grinned gleefully

  but where did he have it when he was hanging
around the science building 

  undoubtedly he had it stationed in the upper atmos-
phere and he conveyed us to it in some mysterious
manner

  suppose we ask him

  i have tried to communicate with him but my efforts
have been unsuccessful however i believe i can en-
lighten you both on one point my observations tend to
the prophecy that we are speeding toward the constella-
tion of perseus or andromeda at a terrific rate

  well that is the best news i have heard since the cal-
culus questions were stolen jim grinned

  but what about our earth i asked is it still
visible 

  no the earth dwindled away some time ago and now
even our sun has shrunk to a star of the first magnitude

  that ought to be an interesting sight i said starting
to rise

  take it easy mr hunt the sensation of weightless-
ness may not make you any too steady  your feet for
awhile

i arose awkwardly outside of being slightly dizzy
which i laid to the lack of gravity i managed to
follow the white-haired figure of kepling without any
mishaps although my eyes were busily roving over the
fantastic building which jim later told that he had nick-
named the temple of the stars it was formed of a
type of composition that at first glance resembled glass
but although it was transparent yet it glowed with a
silver luminosity giving the effect of diffused moonlight

  as soon as kepling reached the edge of this strange
palace and pointed back to a bright yellow star below us
the luminosity of the floor and walls which i will con-
tinue to call glass for the want of a better name faded
out and the stars glowed through the black abysses of
space at us from all sides like millions of vari-colored
lights how aptly jim had named the ship i was so
awe-struck at the gorgeous spectacle which they pre-
sented that i failed to note the puzzled frown that had
crept over the placid features of the white-haired
scientist

  something is the matter with the sun-i mean our
sun he announced his usually quiet voice vibrating with
a note of alarm

  i expected as much i heard myself saying

  what

  well i mean its a hunch that came to me yesterday
or day before or last week-or whenever it wras that
you gave your lecture on nova persei

  then why didnt you mention it in the office 

  forgot it i suppose so much was happening then
too jim had kidded me he had suggested    oh
certain disagreeable possibilities

  but kepling was no longer listening to me

  look he cried his voice trembling with excitement

  my eyes turned unwillingly-almost fearfully back to
that little yellow star it was ablaze its dazzling glory
seemed to expand-eclipsing the more feeble lights of its
nearest neighbors

  then again i felt that strange presence near me and
turning around i saw the flower-like being floating near
us in all its ghostly silver beauty one long radiant
tentacle slowly separated itself from the others and
pointed to a great opaque globe which began to glow
with a ruby light

  look a new type of telescope i suppose i said as
keplings horror-stricken eyes followed my pointing
finger

  slowly the ruby light began to shrink turning to a
glaring white as it concentrated in a spot of terrific
brilliance

  he is showing us the sun-our sun   the old
astronomers voice ended in a groan

  then suddenly i saw it-that wave of fire-spread-
ing  on every side    spreading jim covered his
eyes as if to shut out the horror of it beside me


amazing stories

the flower-thing floated silently his phosphorescence
touching the scene with a detached unearthly shimmer
perhaps he lingered there with unexpressed and inex-
pressible sympathy

  the wave of flame spread on and succeeding waves
followed it until the glare of the flaming disc became
unbearable but the globe followed the first wave of
fire and slowly the gleaming nucleus drifted to the edge
and out of sight

  jim uncovered his eyes again and stared as a hypno-
tized man might stare at the globe

  flashing in a trillion sparkles the wave of white-hot
gas was reaching for its first planet   

  mercury kepling gasped even as the wave engulfed
it and turned it into a tiny torch

  the light of the conflagration seemed to intensify
as it spread and again the globe followed its expanding
edge i felt my throat tighten as venus swept into view
but almost immediately it was caught up in the veil of
fire seemed to actually explode in hissing steam and
slowly swung toward the edge of the globe as the third
planet accompanied by its tiny silver bubble of a moon
came into the path of the fiery death

  kepling groaned while jim stared like one turned to
stone in that moment of horror as we watched in help-
less misery the luminescent wave creeping upon our little
world i seemed to be able to see with my minds eye
the streets of the cities with their floods of terror-stricken
faces turned skyward-some groping with blind stares
from which sight had been forever blasted and others
glaring with pupils from which the light of reason had
vanished   

  but the wave of death swept on-engulfing the planet
and causing it to gleam suddenly like a large diamond
thrown into a strong light

  kepling slumped limply to the floor that movement
startled jim from his frozen state and he bent over the
old gentleman with white drawn features but i stag-
gered back away from the globe closing my hands over
my face as if to shut out its terrible message my foot
struck a bench and on this i sank dropping my head
into my hands

  infinite moments went by finally i felt a hand on
my shoulder and heard keplings voice murmuring

  i know my boy that it is easier to face the most
horrible death oneself than to realize that everything
one has loved and lived for has been swept away in one
moment of unspeakable terror but the past is past while
we are still alive and must go on

  as wanderers of space

  yes as wanderers of space he nodded gripping
my shoulder harder with his slender fingers for with-
out the need of words it has been revealed to us why
we were kidnaped

  perhaps he too  he seemed sort of helplessly
sympathetic when it happened i murmured noting that
the globe had turned black and that the silver luminosity
had come back into the floor and the walls

  perhaps the wthite head nodded it is a cruel un-
believable fact to face but we must realize that not only
our friends but also all art all history and literature all
the sciences-everything which we call our civilization
has been swept like a gnat into nothingness for when
we three die our race will be no more

  dont jim begged in a whisper instinctively using
the hushed tones that one falls into in the presence of
death

so it was that our great adventnre was begun upon
the ashes of tragedy and this was why the bitterness
of that tragedy never entirely forsook our minds for
though in the days which followed we did much to
regain our zest for life yet behind it always loomed
that terrible knowledge that the past was blotted out-
making the future but a hopeless blank even as those
dark apertures torn in the star-clouds of the heavens
are a blank through which we seem to look into endless
nothingness   

  and now time slipped by almost without the realiza-
tion that it was passing kepling worked almost un-
ceasingly upon copying what he could remember of
scientific books while jim and i spent hours at the glass
wall looking out at the stars which gleamed around us
like endless swarms of fireflies

  we saw our host but seldom although he seemed to
anticipate our wishes in a most extraordinary manner the
objects we had desired always appearing to materialize
from nowhere he himself however kept out of sight
-either preferring to stay invisible or else remaining in
the upper part of the palace-ship which we had never
seen we often commented upon him wandering where
he had come from where he was going and again if he
too was the victim of one of those catastrophes that
astronomers had called novae-an exile without a parent
civilization-a wanderer through space

  this feeling was intensified when passing near to
algol he distracted our attention from the demon
sun by pointing one gleaming tentacle to the nebulous
rotating ring of nova persei which was looming up
like a strange saturn among the stars and then slowly
fading away again into darkness jim was the first
to voice his opinion

  you were right doc this man from space is cer-
tainly interested in nova persei

  kepling nodded thoughtfully

  wanted one sherlock holmes i grinned

  well i dont know why it should but it gives me
the creeps to think that he might have come from nova
persei jim murmured with a shrug

  and the way he has of fading away into nothingness
gives me the creeps i added

  it is equally possible that our methods of locomotion
give him the creeps kepling smiled personally i am
of the opinion that his method has innumerable advan-
tages

  jim laughed

  especially in some of the exploring expeditions that
we probably have in store for us

  look kepling interrupted the nebula around
nova persei is pretty plain now because of our near-
ness-but the condensations-they are easily distin-
guished

  you know doc jim said thoughtfully they do
look like the remains of planets not that im upholding
the theory that they were run down by a dark star but
merely overtaken by the wave of fire

  keplings eyes sparkled suddenly as the idea took hold
of him

  possibly they are i wish i could turn the globe
back to our sun and observe what has happened he
said earnestly the scientist of him fully aroused over
the conception of a new theory

  he had no sooner uttered the wish than the globe
clouded with showers of stars and comets until at an
immeasurably further distance than we had viewed it
the man from space



before a flaming sun flashed upon the screen surround-
ing it was a very faint nebulous haze and dimly marked
were four tiny condensations-somewhat brighter than
the luminescent veil which surrounded them

  why only four i asked in surprise

  we are evidently too far away to see the four minor
planets and those are the major four

  good reasoning jim kepling smiled affectionately
but it does have an uncanny resemblance to nova
persei i put in

  except that the positions are about reversed jim
added

  of course there is no need of forming theories any
more but the habits of a life-time are hard to break
the white-haired figure smiled wistfully as i turned away
from the globe somehow the sight of that gloriously
beautiful funeral pyre hurt me more than the lash of a
whip disconsolately i turned away walking toward the
opposite wall and looking off through the myriad swarms
of stars that glowed in through the darkened sides of the
ship then suddenly i stopped and stared for out of
the tail of my eye i had caught sight of an enormous
colored light ahead of us that loomed up like a vast comet
i looked up quickly the new object which seemed to
have appeared from behind the hidden prow of our space-
ship as if we had been steering toward it and now were
swerving to one side was a brilliant blue sun the lower
third of which was covered by its reddish-yellow com-
panion i had often viewed binary or double stars back
in the old university telescope so the sight was not
unusual but the nearness of this pair made me gasp at
the splendor of the spectacle they presented

  come quickly i called out with excitement

  jim was the first one to reach my side but the white-
haired astronomer was not far behind him

  look at the blue sun up there with its companion that
looks like a huge luminous orange

  must be almack kepling said thoughtfully
almack i asked trying to place the familiar name
yes you will remember that in my lecture on
multiple suns i mentioned this group of three

  three  i said quizzically taking another look at the
apparent double

  yes three behind the orange sun you will see the
thin green outline of the third like all multiple suns
you will remember that they revolve around their com-
mon center of gravity

  did you say the third sun was green  i asked trying
to separate it from the red corona of the orange

  dont you remember our discussion on that very
group jim grinned at me you were trying to figure
out the sunset effects

  sounds more like your ideas you were the inter-
planetary bug of our group

  perhaps so but oh how i would like to take a peek
at a world lit by this trio of colored suns

  that is a wish that i have secretly nursed all of my
life kepling admitted softly

hardly had the words left his lips than the three
jewel-like suns swung back toward the prow be-
coming eclipsed at last by the forepart of the ship

  he is going to take us there i laughed hows
that for thought reading

  well the wish was double kepling smiled and
therefore doubly strong

  triple i corrected

  jim laughed as the silver luminosity came back into
the walls it was the first real laugh i had heard from
him since the days on earth

  i am only hoping that our entertaining host has
adequate means of breaking the speed of the ship the
old professor murmured with a worried frown

  but if we really wanted to worry doc we wouldnt
have to go very far a whole host of funny ideas would
come trooping in jim grinned for instance we might
begin to wonder about the air and if its content would
agree with our lungs or we might wtonder if the planet
is too small and the atmospheric pressure would burst
us as the deep sea fish burst when they come into the
air or we might wonder if the planet is so large and the
atmosphere so dense that we would be crushed   
or 

  that will do for the present i put in

  besides we havent any weapons    he continued

  young gentlemen i for one have full confidence in
the good judgment of our host

  so have l even if i did start out wanting to
kill him off

  i tell you-hes a great animated flower jim agreed

  but the most practical thing i interrupted would
be to get some sleep before we get too close because
we will be too interested in the landing of the ship to
even think about such a thing later on while we do not
know what dangers or hardships may await us on the
new world

  both of my companions agreed on the wisdom of this
suggestion each throwing himself down on his particular
tufted mattress-like rug for a long time however sleep
would not come to me i lay awake wondering to what
weird civilizations this man from the unknown was
carrying us to what destinations were we ultimately
bound what adventures waited us on the morrow
how long would we stay on this world with its colored
suns-and after that-what

  the first thing that i noticed after i had awakened
was the glow of the colored suns upon the silver luminos-
ity of the walls a green light blended into lavender and
then purple was followed by orange in unending splen-
dor

  i sat up and drank in the cubistic beauty of the crystal
palace under these changing rays when i stirred jim
immediately sat up and called out

  how are these for stage effects if i could transport
them to broadway wed both be rich

  but my laugh that followed this apparently thoughtless
remark died in my throat

  come now im sorry no gloomy thoughts today

  i nodded with a smile walking over toward the walls
as usual this movement on our part was the signal for
the luminosity to die out but this time the light which
shone through from the colored suns was even more
intense than the silver which up to now had seemed to
act as a screen

  suddenly keplings voice sounded softly behind us

  look toward the prow of the ship

  we turned our faces upward almost simultaneously
and gasped to see the disc of a planet swinging between
us and the star-spangled blackness of space it was
tinted green and orange-one side of a mountain chain
being of a greenish hue and the other a reddish orange

  what about the pressure  jim asked anxiously

  the cultured voice droned a low reply that might have
been the part of a class-room lecture


amazing stories

with a roar of agony that reverberated from cliff to cliff through that glowing crater the
               great animal leaped into the air and headed straight for me	
the man from space



  the size of the body is close to that of our own
earth and so the pressure is about right while it is far
enough from its suns to give a very pleasant tem-
perature

  what did i say about our ghost-like friend

  was it you that said it i teased jim we hadnt
completely overcome our earthly habit of annoying each
others peace of mind even with the ever-present example
of gentle manners we had in the old professor

  i didnt believe that our host would knowingly lead
us into danger kepling put in innocently concerning
the contents of the atmosphere however we can only
take a chance

  i am only waiting for the opportunity to take it
jim grinned

  dont be so sure about the chance i nodded it
looks very much as if our engineer has decided to give
the planet the go-by

  indeed the disc was rapidly swinging toward our
stern kepling watched for a few moments in silence
and then smiled

  he is turning the ship around in other words he
is going to lower us stern first upon the planet

  but what is the idea doc

  he probably has noted our interest and intends to
allow us unobstructed observation

  after a moment it wras quite plain that this was
indeed just what was happening as the great globe
rushed up toward us lit by its sinking green and rising
orange sun we kneeled down and finally threw ourselves
prone upon the floor as the mountain chains took more
definite form kepling was the first to point out the
vast moon-like craters that dotted the face of the planet
and lifted jagged crags skyward from the level of what
appeared to be a dead plain

  evidently very little water the astronomer com-
mented tersely

  the seas do appear to be dried up-very much like
the state on the moon jim agreed

  the green sun had dropped from sight when at last
we decided that the light patches on the mountain tops
were snow it was an orange world that we now rapidly
lowered ourselves upon hovering sometimes and again
seeming to waver along sideways as if seeking a par-
ticular spot which the engineer had admired during a
previous visit jim was the first one to suggest this pos-
sibility and once the idea was planted it grew upon us

  we finally passed a part of the wildly mountainous
country which began to be lit by the blue sun on one side
and the orange on the other at this point the ship
ceased to waver and began to drop rapidly toward the
mountains landing with a scarcely perceptible jar on a
level plateau that was just opposite a tremendous talon-
like range of peaks the little plateau upon which we
found ourselves seemed to be itself the peak of a moun-
tain though not as high as the chain opposite-nor could
we look down the other side for another glance showed
us that our resting place was not quite the top but a
small ridge had to be climbed first for a moment now
we rested in shadow but it was a weird twilight the
greenish tint lingering in the heavens only as a kind of
afterglow giving the effect of strangeness which i have
sometimes noted on earth after a wild storm has mo-
mentarily torn a cleft in the clouds for the zodiacal light
to peer through

  then as we stood there by the glass walls our spectre-
like host floated down toward us from the shimmering

upper drapes and pointing with one of his lustrous ten-
tacles he called our attention to an open doorway
through which a cool breeze sprang into the ship

jim was the first one through landing in the moss-
like growth of the plateau with one long jump i
followed bounding along like a puppy that has been
held in confinement he ran with long leaps and jumps
toward the edge of the cliff where he stopped and waved
like a maniac i caught up with him with such a leap
that i almost went over the cliff while the white-haired
figure of the scientist followed with more dignity but
when i looked down into the valley the unearthly char-
acter of this moon-scape left me gasping

  imagine if you can a range of huge silt mountains
from which ever-tumbling veils of snow and rock
dropped intermittently into a gorge four times deeper
than the grand canyon with a dull roar it seemed as
i stood there that i was gazing upon a staircase for
giants leading down to a bottomless pit of half-fluid
mud and then over it all that weirdly-changing sky and
finally the first gleams of the blue sun as it climbed
through a knife-slashed pass

  i was still looking in awe-struck silence when
keplings voice murmured

  i believe that the scene on the other side just over
the ridge is perhaps equally interesting

  how can it be jim gasped

  such is the judgment of our host at any rate he
pointed up that way but you two rushed off too vigor-
ously to even notice his instructions

  well we can go up there but doc just look at
that pit

  the region is evidently still volcanic kepling mused
picking up a rock

  some push certainly heaved up those mountains but
look at that swamp jim persisted

  kepling nodded thoughtfully

  i bet its full of funny-looking monsters i laughed

  not-so funny close up jim interrupted but lets
take that look at the other side personally i feel like
getting some exercise the only trouble with space-
travel is that there are so few stop-overs and those are
so far apart

  so with jim leading the way we climbed up the rocks
leading toward the ridge once over the top however
our leader did a war dance to convince us of his approval
of the view while i turned and smiled at kepling the
old scientist waved away my offer of assistance and i
too leaped over the intervening rocks where i stopped
and slumped down with awe-struck eyes for yawning
below us wras the cavernous depths of a vast crater
where a molten lake boiled and bubbled-the living lava
splashing up with livid spurts of hellish splendor in the
glowing pit-miles below us across from us the oppo-
site walls of the crater were outlined blackly against a
carmine sky the sinking rays of the setting orange sun
giving the appearance of a huge conflagration raging
down the unseen slopes of the other side which having
swept through the crater had left this lake of glowing
embers behind

  overhead the sky was turning a reddish-purple while
over to one side a huge purplish moon half ruby and
half blue was rising

  kepling stopped for a moment on top and then
stepped over to the very edge and looked down i was
just admiring the old scientists nice sense of balance


amazing stories

when i heard him give a sharp cry saw him throw his
body around as if to catch himself and then go plunging
down through the darkness toward that glowing pit i
started to my feet in horror when a sudden convulsion
of the rocks made me look down imagine my terror
to realize that what we had mistaken for a ridge of rocks
in our delight at the scene before us was a sleeping
dragon-a huge armored creature which had been taking
a nap on the craters rim kepling had been standing
on the things back and therefore had been the first to
fall as it moved so perfectly matched to the rocks had
been his protective coloring that we had not noticed him

  i leapt to his tail intending to then jump to some
lava projections and try to get a glimpse of the old pro-
fessor before the monster turned on me but i was too
slow he swished his tail hurling me unceremoniously
into space whence i dashed helplessly against some rocks
and started to slide down the cliffs toward that red bub-
bling horror miraculously i dont know how i kept my
senses digging my heels and fingers into the earth to
stop me and clutching what plants i could grasp at
last i caught a gnarled plant growing at the very edge
of the long drop into the cauldron there i swung be-
tween the lava cliff and the burning lake with only one
toe-hold with which to climb back

  when at last shivering and perspiring i finally pulled
myself up and lay limply on the black rock a wail and
a roar sent my eyes back to the monster

  something was being pulverized into nothingness
under the maddened stamps of the great beast whose
gleaming red eyes did not note that a new menace flew
through the air at him until it wtas too late and a silvery-
gleaming flower-like creature with shimmering tentacles
lit upon his back like a giant insect of some terrible
malignant type with a roar of agony that reverberated
from cliff to cliff through that glowing crater the great
animal leaped into the air and headed straight for me-
maddened into frenzy by the stinging thing which he
could not shake off each leap shook the whole moun-
tain as those tons of animal flesh crashed to earth

  then suddenly with a more ominous roar i felt the
whole cliff tremble and leaped back just as the entire
face of the mountain gave way carrying with its rush
of rocks like a struggling ant the brown dragon and the
silver thing that still clung to its quivering flanks like a
phosphorescent flower 

for a moment i was too much concerned with racing
the breaking rocks on the top of the slide to catch
more than a glance of the dragon that rolled under the
thunder of the avalanche but after the dust had at last
cleared away from the freshly-glowing lava lake i sat
down on the tip of the rim and stared with unseeing eyes
into the cauldron

  behind me with its glass walls glittering in the rising
rays of the blue sun the palace ship which jim had nick-
named the temple of the stars stood peacefully
waiting for the gleaming master wrhich would never re-
turn before me the ruby color of the cauldron changed
subtly through all the shades of lavender to purple as
the blue sun climbed higher and the orange sun deepened
its glow to the red of a deep garnet before me a few

loosened rocks still bounded hollowly down the cliffs   

  of my companions who had accompanied me over the
rim in such high spirits not a shred remained to tell that
they had ever lived indeed seated here upon a giant
crater-like a gnat that surveys a mountain gorge-to
what end had i struggled so madly to preserve my life
doomed a i was to die on this wild weird world-or
in case i did learn the secret of the ships propulsion and
fuel-then to wander through space forever alone-the
last living creature of my kind 

	  

ob hunt will you wake up or shall i have to
carry you out of here i heard jims voice asking
impatiently

  i opened my eyes suddenly looking in consternation
from the streak of yellow sunshine that was lazily
streaming over the classroom floor back to the very
amused eyes of dr kepling

  but i thought   

  never mind what you thought come on and get
moving

  but jim were still on earth and our sun   
why its all right its normal-isnt it 

  a deep horse-laugh greeted this statement from the
vicinity of the doorway where a number of amused stu-
dents were lingering

  make a fool of yourself if you wish-but count me
out jim snapped starting toward the door

  i picked up my books sheepishly and followed him
apparently deaf to a number of wise-cracks that were
hurled at me only when we were nearing the house
did he deign to notice me

  you picked out one of the most interesting lectures
of the year to sleep on you poor nut

  i know-it was about nova persei

  oh you did hear some of it did you

  of course i did then after a moment you know
jim i have a funny hunch that those condensations were
the remains of planets which were consumed by the wave
of fire which the main sun threw off when it exploded
sleep all through a lecture and then presume to know
something about it eh well mr would-be scientist
get this-the collision theories fit the facts of nova
persei better than the explosion theory

  after that i subsided only in front of the house i
laid a hand on his arm

  are you still too peeved to play our usual set of
tennis this afternoon

  sorry old sleepy-head but i have that calculus quiz
coming off this afternoon

  oh the questions-no one stole them

  well arent you just brimming over with the most
amazing ideas who would be fool enough to steal the
calculus questions then with a laugh-say boy i
only wish that i could answer that dumb question in the
affirmative-but there is no such luck 

  authors note i realize that there are incon-
sistencies in this dream of bob turners but who lias
ever heard of an entirely consistent dream

our linguists who can in turn collaborate with the ex-
perts of our secret service in solving the code we will
thus be in a position to learn of the plans of the enemy
in advance

  good idea this is going to be a whole lot of fun-
for me at least and i am sure it will be for you as
well

  it certainly will be i am looking forward with much
interest to the possible deciphering of the enemy mes-
sages but it seems to me the biggest job of all will be
to convince our world of the danger that threatens and
to obtain official action before it is too late think of
the calamity that hangs over the heads of our people
less than a dozen of those huge spheres could lay waste
half of our own united states in a very few days if they
struck in our present defenseless condition i am much
concerned over the outlook having had some experience
in getting governmental recognition and action on im
portant matters

  ray laughed i know how you feel old man he
said i have had one or two such experiences myself
but in this case i think there will not be much trouble
the messages-the photographs-the captured weapons

of the callistonians-all are very definite proof of our
story then we have lola to present in person

  gary looked over his shoulder and saw that lola and
eddie were bent over the pad on which the girl was
again sketching rays eyes followed his friends glance
and a broad grin spread over his features

  i should have said that eddie has her to present he
remarked

  the two scientists gazed benignantly at the lovers
whose heads were drawn so close and who seemed so
entirely oblivious of their presence in the vessel

  the meteor rushed onward toward the world which
was to be rudely awakened to the necessity of arming
against a foe from out of space unheeding lola and
eddie strove desperately to tell each other what was in
their minds the girl flushed with happiness suddenly
threw her arms about the neck of the man at her side
and ray and gary turned to stare intently into the
screen of the periscope each was convulsed with
pleased merriment but they made not a sound

  eddie found that he could make himself much better
understood by the use of caresses than he had been able
to do with the sketch pad

 so you really are glad she said

 i certainly am i consider it a triumph for dr jones
 and that grand old man paracelsus and of course i de-
 serve some praise as i supplied the money and the in-
 spirationm

 dont you think i deserve some credit asked the
 wife

why ruth what do you mean

 silly she cried



 in the course of time the colonists landed in san
 francisco and the three reiswicks started at once for
 new york as soon as they arrived there john reiswick
 went to see dr stanfield that man gave him no time
 to say a word

 i am certainly glad to see you i want to tell you the
 news but no one seemed to know where you were or at

least were not willing to tell if they knew right after
you left we investigated the case of that shipping clerk
and his baby and we were impressed with the fact they
were eating an entirely different variety of food than the
average american family was eating we had suspected
that this wave of sterility might be caused by a vitamin
deficiency and so we worked their diet out from this
viewpoint we isolated an abundance of a vitamin which
we will call no  and we found that we could produce
it very cheaply we experimented on several thousand
cases and the results were fine the information was
spread by the government and we see now that there is
no need to worry so it would have been all right for
you to have gone ahead and marry did you go some-
wheres with hermopheles jones the last i heard was
a rumor that you and he were going to duplicate the ex-
periments of paracelsus did you do it did you
produce a baby

  you bet we did replied john reiswick with a grin

id you have any trouble with your radio

last night charley 

the bullion teller swung arouttd to face
his assistant

  nothing else but he replied there
was some kind of a tearing roaring noise that started
about seven-thirty and kept up all night or at least until
i turned in at midnight	

  i had the same trouble glenn hunter replied with
interest it seemed to center at about  meters but
it took in a wide band on each side and just drowned out
everything it sounded like an old type spark-gap
transmitter going full blast except that it was a steady
hum instead of dots and dashes

  thats what it sounded like all right i hadnt
thought of that but it did have the same characteristics
i tried to tune it out by turning my loop but i couldnt
do it the loop helped some but the source was too

   there was a tremendous
report that shattered glass
throughout the bank the
heavy steel door of the bullion
vault was torn from its hinges
and flew out past the guard and
smashed against the opposite
wall with a resounding thud

near and too loud for anything to get through it
moultons set has an aerial so i couldnt try
loop tuning but there was no use in trying to cut
it out with condensers it was such a wide band that it
covered the whole dial what do you suppose it was 
charley barnett never got a chance to expound his
theory for the conversation was interrupted by a mes-
senger who handed hunter a telegram he took it and
tore it open

  listen to this he remarked in disgust  six hun-
dred pounds gold bullion nine hundred fine consigned
federal reserve bank philadelphia due west philadel-
phia station nine-twenty a m tenth be ready to
receive american railway express it wasnt enough
for them to shove in two thousand pounds yesterday
after quitting time they have to start before we open
in the morning oh well i suppose weve got to get
ready for it go open the bullion vault for me and see
where we caa put it will you charley have that last
lot of bars moved if necessary i want to run through
these assay reports before the stuff gets here

  barnett took hunters keys
and set off for the vault whis-
tling gaily he nodded to the
watchman on duty entered the
main vault unlocked the door
of the inner bullion vault and
stepped inside the vault was
dark and he felt for the light
switch and turned it the
switch clicked but no light re-
warded his efforts and he
reached in his pocket for his
flashlight to his disgust he
found that he had left it in his
desk but his searching hand
encountered a box of matches

he drew them out and struck
one

  there was a tremendous
report that shattered glass
throughout the bank the
heavy steel door of the bullion

vault was torn from its hinges and flew out past the
guard and smashed against the opposite wall the light-
bulbs in the vault were broken by the force of the ex-
plosion and the guard was knocked unconscious the
alarm gongs throughout the bank set up a deafening
clanging and the guards rushed to their stations with
drawn revolvers

  in the absence of higher officials the cashier took
charge of the situation and under his direction a body
of guards approached the vault with drawn weapons
while the electrician followed them with spare bulbs
they entered the vault unresisted and new bulbs were
soon lighting up the scene the mangled body of bar-
nett was found beside the door of the bullion vault
badly crushed by the force with which it had been
driven out the bullion vault was apparently not
injured and so far as could be told by a hurried inven-
tory made by hunter nothing was missing

  of course it will take me at least an hour to make
a complete inventory he said to the cashier but
at least the major items seem to be here intact ill
start at once

 t has long been a dream of
 metallurgists to conquer the
 science of transmutation of metals
 also it is a pet theme for writers
 of scientific fiction we are well
 on the road to synthetic foods why
 not synthetic metals this time
 capt meek has devised a truly
 ingenious method for obtaining
 synthetic gold which gives the
 radio yet another use the au-
 thor cleverly blends science and
 fiction so it is hard to tell one from
 the other this is an exceedingly
 plausible story of unusual merit

  do so replied the cashier
as he hurried out to greet the
police who were responding to
the riot call automatically
turned in by the gongs of the
bank

  hunter was busy at the in-
ventory when the police
entered

  have you found anything
missing mr hunter asked
the cashier

  not so far he replied i
want a couple of men to move
these bars so that i can count
them

  surely answered the
cashier ill have them sent in
at once what shipment is
this

  its a little over two thou-
sand pounds of nine hundred
and ninety fine that came in from the west last night
replied hunter its the purest stuff we have had here
for some time its soft as butter just feel it

  the cashier stepped over to the pile of bars and
rubbed his nail against one in surprise he stooped and
looked at the bars closely and then drew out his pocket
knife with the blade he dug at one of the bars for a
moment and then straightened up with a strained ex-
pression on his face

  what did you say these bars were mr hunter he
asked

nine-ninety fine bullion answered hunter why
the cashier stooped and scraped again at the bars
did you receive these yourself mr hunter
yes mr barnett and i checked them in after
closing time because the express company didnt want
to hold over six hundred thousand dollars worth of
bullion over night if they could help it

  mr hunter said the cashier with a drawn face
as he stood up these bars are copper

  copper exclaimed hunter disbelief in his
voice




amazing stories

the cashier pointed silently at the pile hunter
stepped over and looked at them he had been
handling bullion for several years and it took only a
glance to assure him that the cashier was right the
bars which he had checked in the night before as gold
worth twenty dollars an ounce were copper worth less
than that many cents a pound he straightened up
dumbfounded at the discovery

  can you explain this mr hunter asked the
cashier

  i certainly cant replied hunter barnett and i
took them in and they were gold or at least they looked
enough like it to fool both of us

  the cashier looked incredulous a detective sergeant
from the chestnut street station stepped forward

  so its robbery as well as murder he remarked
  murder exclaimed the cashier

  of course its murder replied the sergeant hun-
ter i guess you had better come with us jenkins put
the bracelets on him it looks to me like an open and
shut case

  wait a moment sergeant exclaimed the cashier
mr hunter is one of our most trusted employees
you had better be sure before you do anything like
that

  sure snorted the sergeant why its as clear as
the nose on your face there are a few details that are
hazy in my mind yet but a little questioning at head-
quarters will soon clear them up

  but you havent any evidence sergeant protested
the cashier

  how much evidence do you need asked the ser-
geant scornfully its as clear to me what happened as
if i had been here at the time who left here last
yesterday you might as well tell the truth the watch-
man on duty will know

  i left last replied hunter after we got the stuff
weighed and checked in i let barnett go i stayed a
few minutes and calculated the assay values i must
have left about thirty minutes after he did

  half an hour just gave you a nice time to fix that
bomb didnt it said the sergeant

  bomb what are you talking about asked hunter
slowly

  oh not a bomb just a firecracker replied the ser-
geant with heavy sarcasm it was just a harmless lit-
tle joke on your assistant wasnt it i suppose he
begged you to allow him to open the vault this morn-
ing didnt he

  no i asked him to do it answered hunter

  did you all hear that asked the sergeant tri-
umphantly he admits that he sent the dead man to
open the vault this morning after he had spent half
an hour alone in it last night fixing up a bomb that
would explode when the door was opened this morning
i didnt say anything of the sort replied hunter

hotly what i said was-

   tell it to the district attorney replied the sergeant
jeeringly ive got the goods on you all right
sergeant your idea is preposterous exclaimed the
cashier why on earth should mr hunter wish to
hurt charley barnett

  whats her name said the sergeant suddenly to
hunter

  whose name countered hunter

  the skirt that you and barnett were both chasing
  him ter colored slightly

  i dont think her name needs to enter into it he
replied

  the sergeant turned triumphantly to the cashier

  theres your motive he exulted jealousy is the
reason back of lots of things of this sort even without
that half a million is enough to make most men commit
murder

  half a million asked the cashier wonderingly i
dont quite follow your line of thought

  the sergeant looked disgusted

  its as clear as mud he snorted this guy and his
partner barnett framed it up to have this copper
shipped here billed as gold they timed it so
that it arrived after quitting time and checked it in
themselves and receipted for it that means that the
bank is held for that much gold they probably fig-
ured out that it wouldnt be discovered for a month or
so and then they wouldnt know anything about it
then this bird cant see why he should split the pne any
more than he has to so he sends barnett away and
spends half an hour fixing up a bomb that will bust his
buddy all to pieces in the morning that gives him the
whole smear and gets rid of his rival too well go down
to the d as office and sweat him a little and get the
name of the jane and rake her in the chances are that
she knows all about it and that shell spill the beans
as soon as she finds that hes in hock if she doesnt
come clean right away a little sweating will get it out
of her

  there is no need to sweat mr hunter as you call
it to find out the name of the girl whom he and mr
barnett were interested in replied the cashier stiffly
she happens to be my daughter

  the sergeant look chagrined

  well maybe i am mistaken about her he admitted
grudgingly she may not be in on it but that is no
reason why he shouldnt bump his partner off so as
to get a chance to grab both the swag and the skirt

  i think that you are jumping at conclusions too
hastily sergeant said the cashier mr hunter has
been with us for a number of years and he is held in
high esteem by the officers i am sure that mr fleck-
ner the president will never consent to his being
arrested in any such summary fashion on so little
evidence

  i dont guess that hell get much chance to consent
replied the sergeant with a grin jenkins put those
bracelets on him and take him away three of you
men go along he might have some pals that would try a
rescue stunt

  hunter started to protest but the cashier silenced him

  better go with them quietly glenn he advised
they have the right to take you and we cant stop them
as soon as mr fleckner gets here ill tell him the whole
thing and hell have you out in a few minutes i know
very well that the whole accusation is silly but there is
no use arguing

despite the cashiers representations the presi-
dent refused to take hasty action and hunter was
still in jail when a group met in the presidents office to
consult about the situation mr fleckner a gray-
haired man with a stubborn jaw and a steely glitter in
his eyes that bodes little good to transgressors sat at the
head of the table seated around the table were the
chief of detectives from the city hall the sergeant
who had arrested hunter the district attorney the
the radio robbery



cashier and a quietly dressed little man who so far had
said little and listened much his inconspicuousness in
dress and manner would have enabled him to pass un-
noticed in a crowd yet it was evident that when he spoke
the president listened with respect and close attention

   sergeant said the quiet man suddenly please tell
your story again and tell it carefully be especially
careful in describing mr hunters words and actions
try to lay aside your vanity and prejudice for a moment
so that we can get an idea of what really happened

   the sergeant turned red and looked to his chief as if
for protection the chief of detectives looked sour and
turned to the speaker

   before this bullying goes any farther mr carnes
he said i want to know one thing are you in charge
of this case and if so by what authority

   i am in charge of one phase of it replied the little
man quietly as far as your suspected murder goes
that is a state matter and i have nothing to say about it
as far as the robbery of the federal reserve bank of
philadelphia goes i am in charge by the authority of
the united states of america mr fleckner told you
that i was sent here from the treasury department in
washington it may interest you to know that i am chief
of the federal secret service for this district here
are my credentials if you care to examine them

  the chief of detectives glanced at the credentials
offered to him and then turned to the sergeant

   go ahead and tell your story halloran he grunted
tell it straight too this man is the real goods
sergeant halloran retold his story dwelling at length
on hunters supposed confession about the bomb

  that will do said carnes suddenly he sat for a
moment in thought and then turned to the chief of
detectives

  what has your office done about tracing the gold
shipment he asked

  the chief consulted a memorandum which he drew
from his pocket

   the shipment looks all right he admitted it was
shipped from the golconda mine exactly the same as
other shipments have been the golconda production
of gold has been normal they have been shipping at
about the same rate for several years and they have no
surplus of gold on hand the stuff was assayed while
it was held in the express companys office at the point
of shipment and it was never out of sight of an armed
messenger from the time it left until it reached here
the express agent is ready to swear that he delivered
gold here and that both mr hunter and mr barnett
verified the weights in his presence there were three
guards used to bring it in and they are all old men
here they all agree that it was gold they know the
difference between gold and copper too for we tested
them

  did anyone leave the building after hunter and
barnett last night asked carnes

  no one replied the president i have the com-
plete records of the door guard here after the express
people left there was an eleven-minute interval before
mr barnett left thirty-seven minutes later mr hun-
ter left he was the last one out

  has that vault been disturbed asked carnes

   no it has not replied the president as soon as
mr hunter was taken away mr moulton had the door
propped in place and posted guards to see that no one
entered when i got here i confirmed his orders and

had the vault left undisturbed for your examination
  lets look at it remarked carnes

  at the vault he took merely a cursory glance around
touched the pile of copper bars negligently and then
turned to sergeant halloran

  your theory is that mr hunter arranged a bomb
that exploded shortly after the vault was opened in the
morning isnt it he asked

  yes sir replied halloran eagerly as far as
i--

  answer my questions please and dont volunteer
opinions snapped carnes you have done enough
damage already when you entered the vault did you
smell any peculiar odor

  no i didnt replied halloran shortly

  did you mr moulton asked carnes turning to
the cashier

  i noticed no odor at all replied the cashier

  how soon after the explosion did you get here
  within a minute or two

  i thought so remarked carnes meditatively ser-
geant halloran did you ever arrive at a place where a
bomb had gone off within half an hour after it had
happened 

  yes several times

  and when you did did you ever notice an acrid odor
of burned powder

  yes every time admitted halloran

  and you noticed nothing of the sort here dont
let your imagination run away with you did you
no sir i did not

  neither did mr moulton and yet he arrived at a
time when the air should have been thick with smoke
and the odor of burned explosive very noticeable
strange isnt it 

  what has that to do with it interrupted the chief
of detectives it is quite probable that they didnt
notice it in the excitement

  possible but not probable replied carnes did
you ever examine the scene of a bomb explosion
dozens of times replied the chief

  the local damage done at the point where the bomb
lay was always quite extensive wasnt it

  certainly

  ah yes replied carnes with a far-away look in his
eyes also fragments of the container can usually be
found embedded in the walls i dont seem to observe
any here perhaps you will point out to me just where
the bomb lay that exploded this morning

  the detective was silenced

  i fancy that we are through with sergeant halloran
for the present remarked carnes if the rest of you
gentlemen will join me in mr fleckners office we can
discuss the matter further

  are you of the opinion that there was no bomb mr
carnes asked the district attorney when the con-
ference reassembled minus sergeant halloran

  it wras not a bomb replied carnes positively
what in heavens name caused the explosion then
asked the president

  i dont know said carnes thoughtfully in fact
there are several puzzling features about the case i am
sure that it was not a bomb or any usual explosive that
did the damage it acted like a gas explosion but there
are no gas mains in the building and to introduce enough
gas to cause an explosion of that magnitude into the
vault by any means other than a pipe would require


amazing stories

several heavy bulky cylinders that could not be hidden
and no such things have entered or left the building
further i can see no object in causing an explosion

  sergeant hallorans theory is- said the chief

of detectives

  we can eliminate that interrupted carnes i am
sure that gold was delivered here last night a ship-
ment of copper might have fooled one man but unless
two express messengers and three bank guards were in
on it as well as hunter barnett and the express agent
it wouldnt be possible i believe that the gold was de-
livered and stolen from the vault last night after hunter
left i am inclined to think that hunter knows no more
about it than we do

  all the same well hold him for a while replied
the district attorney

  suit yourself said carnes with a shrug if i
were you fd turn him loose and if i suspected him
id have him shadowed however thats your business
and i dont want to butt in

  the district attorney smiled

  now chief carnes went on addressing him the
secret service can cover the matter of that shipment
and the express messengers more thoroughly than your
men can if you really want to cooperate put your
best men on the task of running down the past history
of every guard wtho was on duty here last night

  ill be glad to replied the chief of detectives as he
and the district attorney rose to leave the entire
resources of my office are at your service

  thank you replied carnes as he bowed slightly
mr moulton he went on as the remaining three
reseated themselves sergeant halloran indicated in
the course of his remarks that both hunter and barnett
were interested in your daughter how much of that
may be true and how much may be his imagination you
know better than i however just as a matter of form
i would like to have a talk with her

  as far as her knowing anything about the robbery is
concerned of course there is no truth in it replied the
cashier shortly as far as the interest of the two men
in her goes she can tell you how far it had gone better
than i can if you care to interview her i will call hen
there is no need for that said carnes i will
be glad to go to your home and talk to her there
she is in the building replied the cashier she has
been here for some time waiting for a chance to inter-
cede for glenn hunter i can call her in a moment
carnes nodded assent and the cashier went out
returning in a few minutes with a strikingly handsome
girl she was about nineteen of a slim and graceful
build that just escaped being too slender her firmly
modeled chin gave the lie to her dreamy eyes but
carnes as he glanced at her shrewdly surmised that the
recent tears which it was evident that she had shed
might account for some of the mistiness that marked
them he sprang to his feet as she entered and bowed
deeply in acknowledgment of her fathers introduction

  sit down miss moulton please he exclaimed
holding a chair for her his voice sounded all polite-
ness and concern and fleckner smiled to himself as
he saw that carnes had placed her chair so that she sat
facing the light while his own face was in shadow

she seated herself as he requested and with folded
hands awaited his questions carnes seemed at a loss
as to how to begin

  miss moulton he said hesitatingly it seems that
one of your friends mr hjunter has been arrested by
the local police as a suspect in connection with the death
of mr barnett some of the city detectives seem to
think that jealousy may have been a contributing factor
in the affair in order to clear up the situation would
you mind telling me what you know about both of these
men

  glenn had no reason for jealousy and he knew it
replied alice moulton in a calm monotone that hinted at
inward agitation both he and charley barnett have
been quite regular visitors at my fathers house for
nearly a year and about two months ago both of them
proposed to me i refused to give an answer to either
of them at the time and told them that i would decide
later last night i accepted glenn and while he was
present i telephoned charley and told him my decision
he apparently took it quite calmly and when he learned
that glenn was there he asked to talk to him and con-
gratulated him very nicely despite their rivalry they
have always been the best of friends so you can see
that the idea of jealousy is absurd

  mr hunter was at your house last night

  yes he was he came in after supper about eight
i should say and stayed until after eleven

  what were you doing asked carnes i beg your
pardon he went on hastily you need not answer that
question it is quite evident what a newly engaged
couple would do under the circumstances

  the ghost of a smile hovered for an instant on alice
moultons lips

  we werent doing what you might suspect she
said i have no objections to answering in point of
fact we were trying to play the radio

  trying to

  yes but we couldnt get anything there was a
peculiar buzzing noise that drowned out every station
and neither glenn nor i could tune it out it started
about seven-thirty before he came in and it wras still
going when he left of course we werent working
with the radio all the time but we turned it on at least
a dozen times and tried to get something but we never
succeeded

  do you know anything about mr hunters circum-
stances asked carnes

  naturally i do she replied he inherited quite
a little money from his father and he has added to it
by wise investments at the present time he has an in-
come aside from his salary of nearly four thousand
dollars a year

  of course you believe him innocent of this whole
business

  of course she said hotly the idea of his guilt
is ridiculous why on earth should he do a thing like
that he had no cause for jealousy of charley as i
have told you as far as robbery goos he has a good
income as it is and he knows very wrell that i would
never consent to share any stolen money with him i
know that hes innocent and i came down here to see
daddy and mr fleckner and see if they couldnt get
him out of jail wont you help me surely you dont
believe him guilty

  no i dont replied carnes id release him at
once if it were in my power but unfortunately it isnt
dont cry my dear he went on hastily as alice moul-
tons lips began to quiver just keep a stiff upper lip and
i think that well have him out of jail soon
the radio robbery



  do you really think so she exclaimed gratefully
oh mr carnes til love you forever if you do
thats plenty of inducement to make me do my best
he answered gallantly now the best thing that you
can do is to go home with your father and lie down and
try to get a little rest you cant do any good here mr
moulton you take her home ill place her under arrest
and appoint you a deputy to take charge of her and
produce her when called for if sergeant halloran or
any of his cohorts try to get to her tell them that she is
under federal arrest and that you cant let them talk to
her without my permission itll be a cold day in
august when they get it

  when alice and her father had gone carnes turned
to the president

  mr fleckner he remarked this case has me puz-
zled for all my shortness to halloran i thought that
possibly there might be something to his theory but miss
moultons statement seems to upset it thoroughly by
removing the motive of course ill check up on her
statements but they are undoubtedly true frankly i
cant explain a good many things we need to know first
there is the matter of that gold shipment either there
was a widespread conspiracy with a lot of people in it
in which case it will be easy to trace it down or else gold
was delivered here last night in that case what became
of it also why did the person or persons who removed
it go to the trouble to replace it with bars of copper that
are identical in appearance with the purloined gold 

  second there is the explosion it might have been
designed to get hunter as well as to get barnett unless
hunter planted it a thing i am not yet ready to admit
also what kind of an explosive was it it had ap-
parently no center of brisance and it left no fumes or
odor and no fragments of container also how did it
get in these questions all have to be answered before
we are in a position to even start a search for the thieves
with your permission ill look at that vault again
this time carnes did not content himself with the
cursory glance around that he had given the vault on his
first visit but went over it inch by inch in search of
clues even examining the floor and walls with a magni-
fying glass and sounding every square inch of walls
floor and ceiling at the end of three hours he returned
to the presidents office

  what did you find mr carnes  asked fleckner
nothing he replied i have been over every inch
of that vault searching for a means of egress for the
gold or ingress for the explosive and i have found ab-
solutely nothing i know as much as i did when i
started in and no more  the case is beyond my depth
what are you planning to do 

  call for help replied carnes with a wry smile
there are some aspects of the case that point to the
need of more specialized knowledge than i possess i
am going to call up washington and ask that dr bird
of the bureau of standards be sent down here

  who is he

  one of the ablest research men in the bureau re-
plied carnes and one who doesnt confine his research
to the regular routine for instance he knows more
about blood stains and dust explosions to mention only
two specialties of his than any other man in america
he has helped us out several times on counterfeiting
cases when he comes i want him introduced as a
representative of the washington post no one but you
and i are to know his real identity

  how soon will he get here  asked the president

  if i can get in touch with my chief he will make
arrangements for him to get a plane at bolling field and
he will be here inside of three hours can we get into
the bank tonight

  telephone me as soon as he arrives and ill meet
you at the bank

  fine replied carnes now may i use your wash-
ington wire

three hours later a plane roared to a landing at
the philadelphia navy yard and carnes greeted
the passenger dr bird was grossly misnamed there
was nothing of the bird in his appearance if one except
the ostrich he stood well over six feet in height and
was broad and burly in proportion his prognathous
jaw and unruly shock of curly hair gave him the air
of a prizefighter and it was not until an observer noticed
his hands that the scientist stood revealed long slender
delicate hands they were the hands of a musician or a
sleight-of-hand performer with long tapering sensitive
fingers stained in splotches by acid

  hello carnes he roared in a bull-like voice what
have you got on tap this time another counterfeiting
case

  not this time doctor replied carnes as he hastened
forward to grip the outstretched hand this time its
robbery with possible murder

  good ejaculated the doctor murders are always
interesting glad i brought my traveling laboratory
i cant see where i would come in on a robbery though
this is a rather unusual robbery replied carnes as
he picked up two of the four bags that the pilot had un-
loaded from the plane i think that youll find it in-
teresting

  all of your cases are unusual even the most com-
monplace ones when you get stuck snorted the doctor
if you chaps would just manage to learn a little ele-
mentary chemistry you would save me a lot of wild-
cat trips of this nature

  every man to his trade doctor answered carnes
cheerfully you would be broken-hearted if we didnt
call on you occasionally come along ive got a taxi
waiting and well stop and feed you five cups of black
coffee before we go to the bank

  all right if its good coffee replied the doctor as
he picked up the remaining bags and followed carnes

  when they -arrived at the bank fleckner met them
and was anxious to give all the details but the doctor
stopped him impatiently

  i dont want to hear a thing about it just now he
announced carnes tells me that there are certain
scientific aspects involved and i want to approach the
problem with my mind unencumbered with details of
what you have done and theories you have propounded
ill ask questions as i need to

  as they entered the vault the doctor stopped and
sniffed like a fox-terrier

  explosion eh  he remarked to carnes where was
the stuff planted

  thats one thing for you to tell me doctor replied
carnes i have been over every inch of the vault and
there are no signs of a local center of brisance

  no signs of a container either i suppose

  carnes replied in the negative

  hum said the doctor that eliminates a nitrogen
carrying explosive i could smell traces of the fumes


amazing stories

yet if one had been used my nose is exceptionally sen-
sitive to nitrogen oxides did you find any gas pipes 
there is no gas in the building and i have tapped
every inch of the floor walls and ceiling and there is no
place for the entrance of gas

  it was a gas explosion all the same replied the
doctor positively was there a recording thermometer
or hygrometer in the vault

  the president pointed silently to the two instruments
probably wrecked by the explosion remarked the
doctor as he picked them up no theyre not theyre
still working lets see the dials

  he studied the dials for some minutes in silence ap-
parently making some mental calculations he took a
steel tape from his pocket and measured the vault care-
fully and made some elaborate calculations on a pocket
pad

  what is that stuff he said suddenly pointing to the
pile of copper bars

  that stuff was checked in by the bullion teller
hunter for gold last night replied carnes and this
morning after the explosion it turns out to be copper
hunter is under arrest for robbery and murder

  why murder

  his assistant was killed by the explosion youd
better let me tell you the whole story doctor said
carnes

  all right go ahead i might as well let you get it out
of your system before you blow up under the strain
of holding it he replied seating himself on the copper
bars and preparing to listen

  have you any report on the bank guards  he asked
when carnes had finished his story

  nothing definite the three who carried in the bars
are all retired enlisted men of the army with excel-
lent reputations

  what about the shipment

  regular in every way the stuff was assayed and
was in sight of an armed messenger from that time on
one of the messengers wtho traveled with it has been
with the express company for twenty years the other
one has only been with them for about a year and we
are working on his record but so far it has been per-
fectly clear

  what was hunter doing last night 

  he was with his fiancee he managed to get engaged
to the daughter of the cashier here last night and he
spent the evening with her she tells a yarn about try-
ing to work the radio most of the evening and hitting a
lot of static but i expect we know what they were do-
ing all right

  static asked the doctor sharply was there any
bad weather here last night

  it was a calm beautiful night replied the president
funny time to have static trouble remarked the
doctor

  i dont know that she said that it was static an-
swered carnes she said it was a buzzing noise that
prevented them from getting anything and i took it for
static

  buzzing noise said the doctor on what wave
length 

  i dont remember her saying anything about that
  call her up and find out

  carnes returned in a few minutes

  it was all over the dial but seemed worst about 
meters he reported

  the doctor consulted a table that he drew from his

pocket

  funny he commented carnes what did you say
the names of those express messengers were

  i didnt say replied carnes but the name of the
older man is fowler and the younger is named wallace
wallace asked the doctor is he a hunchback
no indeed hes quite tall and very straight

  it cant be the same man then although it might ex-
plain a great deal he said he paced the floor for a
few moments muttering the name wallace under his
breath suddenly he turned to carnes

  i may be crazy or i may not he said at any rate
there is more to this case than appears on the surface
carnes go out and buy me a radio set any sort of a
two or three tube set will do provided it works on a loop
get tubes and batteries and everything needed to put it
in operation also get me a hacksaw and half a dozen
blades and a bottle of strong ammonia

while carnes was gone the doctor busied him-
self in taking from the cases he had brought with
him several instruments and setting them up on a table
by the time he had finished carnes arrived loaded with
bundles

  all right carnes he said give me the saw and the
ammonia and set up your set when you get it in
operation tune in any local station to make sure that its
working right and then set it at  meters and let it
alone im going to examine these bars

  he moistened his handkerchief with ammonia and
rubbed the surface of one of the bars briskly when
the handkerchief had turned blue he examined it care-
fully under a binocular microscope but turned away
with an exclamation of disappointment he took the
hacksaw and sawed one of the bars in halves and scru-
tinized the sawn surface under a powerful glass again
he muttered his disappointment and took up a pinch of
the copper dust made by the saw this he dissolved in
an acid that he drew from one of his bags and put the
solution in a small glass tube which he set up in one of
his instruments a moment later a tinny arc began to
spark behind the tube and simultaneously the radio set
gave off a raucous tearing sound

  shut that thing off he directed as he applied his
eye to an eyepiece projecting from the instrument as
he did so he emitted a low whistle of surprise and con-
sulted a book which he took from the instrument carry-
ing case he whistled again and looked long and ear-
nestly through the instrument again and again he ad-
justed it testing it with standard solutions taken from
one of his cases but his astonishment grew momen-
tarily more manifest

  what is it asked the president breathlessly
what oh that thats a simple electric arc
spectroscope when you volatilize an element in the
arc it gives a certain characteristic set of colored lines
on the prism every element has its own set and no
two are alike its one of the most certain methods of
detecting small traces of a foreign element those bars
are copper all right but the lines arent quite in place
keep still a minute and let me think

  for some minutes he paced the floor

  it isnt possible he said at length and yet it must
be at any rate well have to take a chance on it
carnes my arrival in philadelphia must be kept a com-
plete secret this is very important in the mean time
the radio robbery



go home and take that radio set with you where are
you staying

  at the benjamin franklin
good stick close to your room phone so that i can
reach you in the meantime keep that radio set tuned m
on  meters and let me know at once if it gives out
a squawk like we heard tonight when my spec was run-
ning make arrangements for garage room for a truck
that will come up from camp vail in the afternoon
better arrange to have it kept at frankford arsenal out
in bridesburg thats out of the way and its a gov-
ernment installation mr fleckner remember that no
one must know of my arrival in the meantime you will
give this story to the press and see that it is headlined
he wrote rapidly for a few minutes and handed the
paper to the president he took it and read it aloud
with a puzzled expression

  officials of the philadelphia federal reserve bank
in an attempt to solve the mystery surrounding the theft
of over a ton of gold bullion today sawed in halves one
of the bars of copper that was found in the vault this
led to the discovery that there was a core of pure gold
about one inch in diameter in the center of it the bal-
ance of the bars will be sawed tomorrow in th
meantime a scientist from the bureau of standards has
been sent for and will arrive sometime tomorrow after-
noon

  thats correct said the doctor now hold that
until afternoon but be sure that it makes the late edi-
tions i dont want it to appear on the streets before
five if you could manage to have it published in a
extra about six-thirty that would be all the better
is there gold in the center of that bar asked carnes
in astonishment

  no unfortunately there isnt but it wont hurt to
publish that can you arrange to get that story out as
i want it

  there will be no trouble about that replied the
president i own a good deal of stock in the bulletin
and ill arrange to have an extra on the streets at six-
thirty sharp but i dont understand what its all about
if im right you will tomorrow if im wrong you
probably never will replied the doctor with a laugh
now lets go to bed and get some sleep we may not
have any tomorrow night

  what shall we do in the meantime  asked the presi-
dent

  each of you do what i told you to do aside from
that dont talk keep your mouths shut and say nothing
ill be at the bellevue-stratford registered as walter
griffen

  the day passed slowly for carnes early in the morn-
ing he telephoned frankford arsenal and made arrange-
ments for keeping the camp vail truck with nothing
to do he sat in his room and listened in vain for the
tearing sound from his radio he had a strong desire
to telephone the bellevue-stratford but his previous
association with dr bird tended to discourage him the
doctor always preferred to work in an atmosphere of
mystery in order as he put it to be able to revel in his
successes and to bury his failures

  at six he left his room long enough to snatch a bite
to eat as he left the restaurant a newsboy came down
the street crying an extra carnes bought one and read
under huge headlines an elaboration of the item the
doctor had written the night before he hastened back
to his hotel in hopes of a message but none awaited him

and his telephone was silent until nearly seven-thirty
then it rang and he literally jumped for the receiver

  is that you carnes  asked the voice at the other end
of the wire this is griffen well pick you up at the
corner of ninth and chestnut in about fifteen minutes
watch out for an army truck and board it

  when carnes boarded the truck which slowed down
for him he found fleckner and dr bird in the cov-
ered body with two men dressed in the olive drab of the
army a glance forward showed him that the driver also
wore a uniform

  hello carnes said the doctor make yourself at
home this is sergeant welman of the signal corps
one of the best radio direction finders that the army has
give carnes a headset sergeant he might as well get
in on the fun

  what is it all about asked carnes as he adjusted
the headset and began to receive wips evening pro-
gramme

  youll find out in time replied dr bird with a
chuckle meanwhile enjoy the music auid listen for
anything unusual

  the truck wandered aimlessly up and down the streets
and carnes settled himself to wait he saw that all of
the other occupants of the truck were wearing headsets
which were connected to a large receiver surmounted by
a loop that stood on an elevated platform built in the
center of the truck from time to time the sergeant
would adjust the dials of the receiver tuning in a new
station only to tune it out again in a few minutes half
an hour passed in this way and then the sergeant turned
to doctor bird

  are you sure that you have that wave-length right
he asked

  its right as nearly as miss moulton could tell me
if it shows up at all we ought to get it for she said that
it covered the whole dial

  it seems funny that more people didnt hear it re-
marked the sergeant

  if its what i think it is it would be very easily
trapped replied the doctor it was probably a high
carrier wave that came down only at intervals of course
i may be- whats that

  that was a peculiar rending tearing sound in the
head sets that drowned out everything else

  stop her called the sergeant to the driver he re-
moved his headset and held it at some distance from his
ear while he manipulated the loop mounted on top of the
receiver the sound increased in intensity and the ser-
geant began to work on his fine adjustment for sev-
eral minutes carnes could detect no difference in the
intensity of the sound and at last even the sergeant was
satisfied a flashlight glowed for an instant

  fifty-three-point-six uncorrected he announced
got the location kelley

  his companion grunted an assent and the sergeant
called to the driver

  take the next turn to your left and go straight
ahead

  the truck had not moved over two blocks before the
sound suddenly died out

  its stopped said the sergeant

  i doubt it replied the doctor driver go back
a couple of blocks and see if we can pick it up again
the truck retraced its path and again the tearing
sound dominated all others

  thats what i suspected said the doctor go


amazing stories

ahead driver well just have to hunt for another spot
where we can locate it

  as the truck drove on kelley carefully set an angle
with a protractor and laid off a line on a chart which
carnes saw was a map of philadelphia the truck
drove on for several miles

  stop called the sergeant

  carnes listened carefully and could detect a faint
hum of the same nature as the sound they had plotted
the locating performance was repeated and when the
second line had been laid off the sergeant showed the
chart to dr bird

  too acute an angle for good work he remarked
wed better try to get another shot

  the doctor nodded and the truck set off again for
nearly an hour it cruised around without result

  where does moulton live asked the doctor sud-
denly

  on judson street replied fleckner

  somewhere in the vicinity of tioga and twenty-
second

  good enough commented the doctor driver go
north on broad street to tioga and then turn left to
twenty-second

  at tioga and twenty-second the receiver was still
mute but as the truck crossed twenty-third the tearing
noise again broke forth

  stop called the sergeant

  the new line was plotted and the sergeant studied
the map

  fm satisfied he announced that transmitter is
located on chestnut street between eleventh and
twelfth

  it should be near the bank muttered the doctor
driver take us to the corner of eleventh and chest-
nut

  whats this all about asked fleckner as the truck
set off again

  this is a radio locator truck from camp vail ex-
plained the sergeant we are locating the source of
that sound you heard in your headset this is a very
sensitive receiver equipped with a loop and by turning
it until we get the maximum intensity of sound we are
able to lay off a line on which the sending station must
be by getting several of these lines from different
points we are able to locate the transmitter it must be
at the intersection of the lines

  i can see that replied fleckner but what has it
to do with this case 

  i dont know sir said the sergeant my orders
from dr bird were to locate the set and thats all i
know

  dr bird volunteered no information and fleckner
relapsed into silence the truck stopped at length at
the corner of eleventh and chestnut and the doctor
climbed out followed by the sergeant who carried what
looked like a suitcase with a loop on top in his hand

  come on carnes called the doctor i think we
are going to find our man now you can come too mr
fleckner if you arent afraid of a little gun play

  dont you think you had better explain just a little
doctor asked carnes

  i havent time now listen and get this straight
sergeant welman will lead us to a door on the opposite
side of which will be the sending set that we have been
locating we will break down that door and enter i
have a blank search-warrant that will cover us if we

make a mistake when we enter arrest every one in
the place they may try to resist if the man that i
suspect is at the head of it i am sure they will get
them but above all dont let them destroy any ap-
paratus i know what i am doing carnes just obey
orders and everything will be all right

  as they started down the street sergeant welman
adjusted a small pair of headphones attached to the case
he was carrying to his ears and took the lead from
time to time he would set the case down make a few
adjustments and then resume his onward progress
before a large office building he paused and then
stepped in through the entrance way up the stairs he
led them and down a corridor stopping with increasing
frequency to work on the case at last he paused before
a closed door and pointed silently the group listened
and could hear a faint crackling hum from behind the
door the doctor drew his automatic and motioned to
carnes to do likewise carnes drew his gun and the
doctor motioning him to follow closely took hold of
the handle of the door and tried it it yielded to his
touch and with a sudden effort he thrust it open and
entered carnes and fleckner following closely on his
heels

a curious scene met their gaze the room was
in semi-darkness save where it was illuminated by
a reading lamp set on a table at the table sat two men
bending over a piece of apparatus from which a flicker-
ing blue light came accompanied by the crackling noise
that they had heard outside the room smelled strongly
of garlic

  as they entered the two men sprang to their feet
the nearer one wore some sort of a uniform but no one
noticed him for the other figure completely dominated
the scene he was a man who might have been tall had
he been straight but whose hunched back reduced his
stature to a bare four feet his short bandy legs formed
a striking contrast to huge arms that hung nearly to his
knees topping this misshapen body was the face of
a grecian god thin almost to emaciation huge black
eyes like two burned holes in a blanket regarded the in-
truders with merciless intensity

  good evening doctor wallace said dr bird as he
stepped forward i rather thought that i would find
you at the bottom of this so far as i know you are
the only man in the united states with the imagination
to conceive a scheme like this or the brains to carry it
out

  the lips of dr wallace curled in a thin-lipped wicked

smile

  why didnt i kill you before i started this he said
softly to dr bird i should have known that if i were
the only man able to carry out my experiment that you
would be the only one who would be able to solve it

  thats where you did make a mistake replied dr
bird lightly hold on there he cried suddenly and
sprang forward

  his movement was quick but wallace moved like a
cat before bird could stop him he had reached the
wall and closed an electric switch there was a ex-
plosion and the instrument that had been on the table
flew to pieces carnes and bird stood paralyzed for a
moment by the crash but were galvanized into action as
the explosion was followed by the vicious cracking of a
pistol that wallace had drawn from his pocket dr
birds pistol dropped from a bleeding hand but carnes
the radio robbery



gun woke to life as it spat forth its message of death
wallace swayed for an instant and then pitched for-
ward on his face carnes kept both wallace and his
companion covered while he backed toward the wall and
groped for a light switch fleckner interpreted the
movement correctly and aided him and an instant later
the scene was brilliantly illuminated

  wallace lay face downward in a pool of blood while
his companion stood with blanched face and elevated
hands dr bird ran forward and bent over the pros-
trate wallace

  are you hurt badly wallace  he asked

  youve done for me all right said wallace in a
choking voice blowing flecks of bloody froth from his
lips punctured lung i think damn you bird you
were too clever i left you out of my calculations how
much do you know

  i know a great deal replied dr bird but some
things puzzle me yet if you are dying why dont you
make a clean breast of it

  what do you want to know asked wallace

  how did you get your synthetic gold into the bank
as a golconda shipment

  that was easy my brother there he paused and
pointed to his companion got a position about a year
ago as an express messenger and he rode with the ship-
ment in the same car were eight boxes of books which
really contained my stuff he gave the other messenger
knockout drops and switched the bars

  simple commented carnes

  how did you polymerize that copper asked dr
bird

  the ghost of a smile appeared on wallaces face

  i expect that you would like to know he said but
youll never find out my brother doesnt know and i
destroyed my apparatus as soon as i finished this is
my dying statement and i want to make it clear that i
was the brains of the whole scheme my brother was
just a tool in my hands as soon as i heard that you
were summoned i wired my disintegrater with a charge
of explosive inside and you saw the result you will
never be able to reconstruct it i made only one mis-
take i miscalculated the force of my disintegrating ray
it didnt go deep enough

  yes it did replied dr bird that newspaper
story was one that i gave out in the hope of getting you
to start your apparatus up again you did a good job
the first time

  fooled by god exclaimed wallace as he strove
to rise to a-sitting position damn you bird-

the sentence ended in a bubbling grunt the blood
gushed from wallaces lips and his head fell for-
ward dr bird leaned forward and listened at the chest
of the prostrate man for a moment and then rose to his
feet

  there gentlemen he said dramatically lies the
body of one of the most brilliant geniuses of this gener-
ation

  he removed his hat and bowed to the prostrate figure
put cuffs on your prisoner carnes and come along
were going up to the district attorneys office i had
a little chat with him when i got my search-warrant and
he is waiting for us he has hunter up there also the
future mrs hunter and her father ill explain there
in the district attorneys office a half hour later dr
bird leaned back chewing at a cigar

  doctor frederick wallace he began was the most
brilliant scientist of this generation but he had a crim-
inal twist in his mind how far his physical misfortunes
warped his morality is hard to tell he may have been
more to be pitied than blamed he worked at the
bureau for some time but his ideas were far above our
routine work and he quit i lost track of him and hadnt
thought of him for several years when this case came up

  when i got to the bank and looked around i real-
ized of course that the explosion was caused by gas
but my sense of smell is unusually acute and i could de-
tect no trace of any unusual odor then i looked at
the recording hygrometer and the answer was plain
you gentlemen probably know that when hydrogen gas
is mixed with air it explodes quite violently giving as
its only product of explosion water vapor the hygro-
meter showed a sudden great increase in the amount of
water vapor in the air immediately after the explosion
and i knew that it was caused by hydrogen gas the
next thing was to find out how it got in there

  i discarded the idea of a pipe for carnes assured
me that there was none and i know what a careful in-
vestigator he is the next thing that attracted my at-
tention was that pile of copper bars and i figured that
there must be some connection where the gold got out
and that copper got in hydrogen gas could get in too i
hadnt an idea so i started asking the first things that
came into my mind carnes mentioned that radios had
given trouble the night before i knew that it was a per-
fect night for reception in washington and mr fleckner
assured me that it wras a fine night here besides the
description was not that of static and the combination
set me to thinking

  i dont know why i asked carnes the names of the
express messengers who rode with the shipment but i
did and when he said wallace it brought to my mind
some experiments that dr wallace had been working
on but the whole idea seemed too weird for credence
however i could see no other solution and i took a
chance

  now to properly explain this i must give you a
little science you may have heard of the periodic table
of the chemical elements in any case it is a method
of arranging the elements in the order of their ascending
atomic weights in such a manner that elements of like
properties fall into groups the group that attracted
my attention was the second which contains among
other elements copper with an atomic weight of 
and gold with a weight of  if we multiply 
by three and add six we get practically the atomic weight
of gold the atomic weight of hydrogen by the way is
 here we have the three elements entering into
the problem definitely connected in a common chemical
ratio namely one three and six

  while he was in the bureau wallace was working
on the problem of synthesis and analysis of elements
if it were possible as he used to contend to polymerize
copper and to add the right amount of hydrogen and
energy one might get gold or something resembling it
such a synthesis might easily be unstable and might
easily disintegrate under the influence of a wave length
of exceeding shortness if it did disintegrate the prod-
ucts would be copper and hydrogen gas

i sent carnes out for a radio set to find out whether
the spark that i suspected was working but it was not

        do not know what electricity is but we have learned some of its
uses which knowledge is being extensively utilized although the
lack of vitamines has been claimed by eminent authorities to be destruc-
tive of the well-being of the human being nobody has as yet learned ex-
actly how they operate-perhaps it is by catalysis it is no simple matter to
predict the possibilities attendant on such a discovery dr lemkin who is
a chemist of high standing and an author is personally interested in the
subject of vitamines and is therefore qualified to visualize in good scientific
fiction some of their possibilities there is no telling what wonders science
may yet perform for the good of humanity by the use of vitamines when they
have learned more about them this is a truly scientific story of intrinsic value

                      illustrated by wesso

curvy said dr beardsley in his familiar
high-pitched and trembling voice is what we
medical men call a deficiency disease 

  my answer was a nod of courteous assent
i had ceased wondering why the aged doctor
had summoned me to listen to a private lecture on diet
and disease for i suspected the unfolding of another
radical discovery from his fertile brain although i
had a vague recollection of having heard such terms
during my student days their essential meanings had
faded away in my memory almost to the vanishing point

  and why is it known as a deficiency disease con-
tinued the old professor in his best classroom quiz style
evidently expecting no answer to his question i cer-
tainly could have vouchedsafed no satisfactory reply on
the spur of the moment he went on because the
diet is deficient in one important food element the one
we now know as vitamine c

  i readily agreed to the irrefutable logic of his argu-
ment and settled back awaiting the rest of his scientific
discourse

  but scurvy is by no means the only disease that
results from a nutritional deficiency continued dr
beardsley his cracking voice rose to a higher pitch
and his faded gray eyes acquired almost a youthful
flash as we warmed up to his subject feed a child
on a diet that is lacking in vitamines a and d and it
will develop the dreadful disease called rickets deprive
an individual of the essential vitamine b and he will
fall victim to the asiatic disease known as beriberi a
diet deficient in vitamines a and b will bring on pellagra
all of these are deficiency diseases

  the old doctor stopped to catch his faltering breath
and raised a shaky hand to mop his brow his air of
suppressed excitement appeared to indicate that he was
fairly bursting with some kind of news probably of
another of his long list of scientific achievements

  to me dr beardsley had always been an interesting
enigma it was now almost twenty years since i had
first sat at his feet one of his many admiring students
at the university his lecture course in biological

chemistry was among the most popular in the entire
curriculum principally because of the magnetic per-
sonality of the old physician yes-old he was even
in those days-aged and stooped with the weight of
more than three score years on his narrow shoulders

  yet despite his age the doctor was a veritable tornado
of mental and physical energy at a time when most
men have withdrawn from the whirlwind of struggle and
strife leaving the world of mad endeavor to younger
hands and clever intellects dr beardsley was still to be
found in the front ranks this indefatigable almost in-
exhaustible dynamo of human energy still carried on
in the van of medical and educational achievement

  grand old dr beardsley in those rosy days of
university life he was to us eager students an unending
source of joy and inspiration to me he represented
the summation of mental vigor and physical magnetism
we were quite chummy together and frequently he in-
vited me to come over to his laboratory and watch some
of his experiments frankly i was at a considerable
loss as to the nature of most of them to tell the truth
i had elected dr beardsleys lecture course for no more
serious a reason than that i needed the two points for
my graduation and since the attractive personality of
the old prof was one of the major topics of conversation
about the campus i determined to enroll in his subject

  even with my extremely meagre background of
biology and medico-chemistry i was still conscious in
those student days of the phenomenal nature of some
of those experiments that the doctor was conducting the
vast scope of his scientific investigations was a revela-
tion he thought worked and lived in terms of human
betterment and progress his advances in the realm of
biological science contributed a substantial achievement
in that direction

  when i left college to enter newspaper work i saw
to it that i did not lose contact with the aged professor
thanks to the smattering of medical and chemical infor-
mation that i had absorbed from being exposed to the in-
fluence of dr beardsley both in his classes and in his
laboratory my reportorial assignments frequently carried

amazing stories

me to his scientific workshop to cover some new contri-
bution that he had made in his chosen field and during
the course of almost a decade this tireless investigator
was responsible for some truly revolutionary achieve-
ments

  you recall his remarkable work several years ago in
the discovery of the new ductless or endocrine gland that
we now know as the infra-thyroid and how he iso-
lated its internal secretion or hormone and proved con-
clusively that it was the determining factor in producing
those manifestations of emotion that we classify as fear
hate joy love and anger

  then too i need do no more than remind you of his
accomplishment in synthesizing the now famous ferro-
calcium the strange material that stimulates to such a
remarkable degree the depositing of lime in the long
bones of the skeletal structure do you remember what
a howl of derision burst forth at dr beardsleys blunt
statement that any adult of subnormal stature can now
add from six to eighteen inches to his height and
didnt that wave of scorn and ridicule turn almost over-
night to the wildest acclaim when the modest scientist
demonstrated the soundness of even his most astonishing
assertion 

one might marvel at my intimate knowledge of
things medical and bio-chemical considering that i
am essentially a reporter whose schooling along those
lines is of necessity highly limited if not absolutely nil
however i had the extreme honor and privilege of being
the first to convey the news of these revolutionary de-
velopments to the layman world through the medium of
my paper for that reason i soaked up more than
just a superficial amount of information about the under-
lying principles of these classic researches

  and here i was again lending a patient ear to the
scientific discourse of the white-haired savant it was
evident in his very tone and demeanor that another of
his momentous pieces of research was soon to see the
light of universal publicity and acclaim

  now all medical men continued dr beardsley in his
faltering voice are pretty thoroughly convinced about
the nature of these deficiency diseases the classical
investigations of mr collum eddy and others have
given conclusive proof that wrhen these mysterious
vitamines are absent from the diet definite diseases
follow scurvy beriberi rickets pellagra each of these
is brought on by a deficiency of some one or more of the
essential vitamines

  but and here the old physicians eyes blazed forth
with the light of triumphant accomplishment why stop
with these diseases what about all the scores of ail-
ments and infirmities that beset human flesh what of
them what of tuberculosis the dreaded white plague
and the scourge of mankind from the dawn of creation
what about the insidious typhoid  what of the count-
less diseases of children which snuff out the lives of
such an appalling percentage of infants in the first months
of their existence what about those fatal organic
diseases that attack the vital portions of the human me-
chanism the digestive system the kidneys the
heart-

  in the fervor of his discourse dr beardsley had risen
from his seat and stood over me as he poured forth his
stream of unanswerable questions suddenly the words
died in his throat in a strange gurgle his eyes bulged

alarmingly and his fingers clutched feverishly at his
breast for a moment i thought the old man was about
to collapse to the floor and i leaped forward to support
his swaying body

  he appeared to recover immediately however and he
waved me back with a gesture of assurance

  its my heart again paul he whispered weakly as
he sank back into his chair the perspiration came out
in glistening beads on his pale forehead and his voice
trembled even more than before

  i guess i shouldnt allow myself to get worked up
to such a high pitch he smiled faintly however its
the one thing that means most to me just now so you
will perhaps excuse my boyish enthusiasm

  i cautioned the doctor against any undue physical exer-
tion or mental strain and following a brief rest he con-
tinued with the unfolding of his pet subject

  cant you realize what im aiming at my boy
queried the old man eagerly although i was beginning
to see the light of dawn i ventured no rash theory of
my own choosing rather to let him reveal the nature of
his revolutionary discoveries without my inexpert as-
sistance

  all diseases and the words came forth with the
deliberate and forceful impact of sledge-hammer blows
to which human flesh is heir-all of them are defi-
ciency diseases

  dr beardsley leaned back with the triumphant air of
a victorious warrior and regarded me closely to note
the effect of this startling announcement

frankly i was somewhat taken aback by the dar-
ing of the doctors assertions true i had learned
from constant experience with the famous scientist and
his astonishing methods always to expect the unexpected
all of the doctors previous contributions to the scientific
knowledge of the day had been in the nature of phenom-
enal revelations by their very unconventionality and
daring they were sufficient to leave one breathless with
amazement yet this new proclamation bolder and more
far-reaching in its scope than any that i had heard before
was to be candid an extremely hard pill to swallow

  but my dear dr beardsley i remonstrated do you
realize what you are saying are you not at one stroke
shattering traditions and beliefs that have been the very
basis of the science and art of medicine for generations 
do you mean to imply that the absence of these mysteri-
ous vitamines in our diet is the primary cause of all
human diseases

  precisely that paul only let me explain further
dont get an incorrect impression the commonly ac-
cepted deficiency diseases which i mentioned at first are
definitely due to a lack in the diet of the four or five
vitamines that we designate by letters at the beginning
of the alphabet that much is pretty generally agreed
upon by most medical workers

  my contention is that we have barely scratched the
surface in our study of vitamines much as my col-
leagues and contemporaries in the field of nutritional
and pathological research have accomplished their
methods have been of the very crudest and here the
old scientists voice was tinged perhaps unconsciously
with the merest trace of scorn

  the truth of the matter is that they have been grop-
ing hopelessly in the dark in regard to the nature of
vitamines and the true cause of disease however for
vitamine z



the last four years i have been working secretly on the
problem and i am almost ready to announce to the world
the nucleus of my discovery

  in substance paul here is what i have proved to
my own satisfaction in addition to the five vitamines
whose presence is now universally accepted all foods
contain varying amounts of other vitamines the exis-
tence of which has never even been suspected hitherto
as to the exact number of these mysterious substances i
am at present in no position to venture a guess but my
work has led me to believe that there must be thirty or
forty of them of this number i have succeeded in
isolating and identifying eighteen

  now here is the astonishing part about it every
disease that is now known whether pathological or or-
ganic is directly traceable to a deficiency of a particular
vitamine that seems like a rather bold generalization
does it not

  it appears that way to me i replied does that
mean that a disease such as for example diphtheria is
not caused by a germ at all but by the lack of a specific
element in the diet which you classify under the head
of vitamines

  thats exactly it my boy cried dr beardsley you
are grasping the idea admirably of late physicians
have been prone to swallow too readily the bacterial
theory of disease doctors have been too confident that
all our human ills may be pinned onto the lowly micro-
organism while i freely admit that a mass of appar-
ently corroborative evidence has been adduced which
would lead the unwary and shallow thinker to the belief
that most diseases are caused by bacteria i firmly main-
tain that relatively crude and inaccurate methods of
manipulation and experiment coupled with a narrow
vision and a distorted perspective on the part of our
scientists have brought about the result that the germ
theory of disease has been foisted on a gullible world
and has been accepted as law by an overwhelming and a
universal acquiescence

  from the very beginning of my work in medicine
and biological chemistry i refused to subscribe to the
bacterial explanation of human and animal diseases in
recent years the development of the study of vitamines
and of their relation to the so-called deficiency diseases
stimulated me to carry on an exhaustive investigation of
the entire subject of foods and their composition in the
hope of extending our knowledge of these essential
nutrient elements of course all of this experimental
work has been conducted with the strictest precautions of
secrecy i was unwilling to announce the nature of my
efforts even to my closest colleagues until i had estab-
lished satisfactory evidence that my theory is justified

  i have now reached the stage in my experiments
where i can say with the utmost confidence and with no
fear of serious contradiction that all diseases known to
man are deficiency diseases arising from the lack of
specific vitamines in the diet of the individual

  and now paul i have called upon you to come here
so that you may be the first to whom my important secret
will be divulged

  dr beardsley paused and sank back with a sigh of
relaxation from the tense and strained position that he
had maintained throughout most of his absorbing recital
i pondered deeply over the old professors words here
was an idea which was truly unprecedented i had been
frequently and forcefully shocked out of some precon-

ceived and firmly rooted notions by the discoveries of
the aged scientist but i must confess that nothing was
ever of so startling a character as this iconoclastic theory
which dr beardsley was now unfolding to me

  proof thats what the all important matter was just
now proof to give incontestible support to these new
beliefs and i said as much to the professor

  plenty of proof smiled the doctor as he rose from
his chair and beckoned me to follow him supporting
himself with the aid of a cane he shuffled nervously
through a door to the right and into the laboratory that
adjoined his study

the professors workshop presented the usual
appearance common to the inner sanctum of an ex-
perimental scientist a long laboratory table occupied
most of the entire length of one wall surmounting it
wrere numerous shelves bearing rows upon rows of neatly
labeled bottles and flasks some containing liquids of
strange and striking hues nearby was a cabinet housing
a number of preserved biological and anatomical speci-
mens in jars of assorted sizes and shapes

  occupying a corner of the laboratory were various
pieces of electrical equipment whose nature i was unable
to fathom a number of physiological charts and pic-
tures were distributed about the walls on the laboratory
table was grouped a collection of chemical apparatus that
the doctor had evidently used in a recent experiment i
recognized distilling sets with water condensers extrac-
tion funnels a bunsen burner and several of the simpler
experimental materials with which i had been vaguely
familiar many years ago

  however what struck me most forcibly as i stepped
into the laboratory on the heels of dr beardsley was the
queer conglomeration of utterly unscientific noises that
arose from the far corner of the room there was a
chorus of chirps and gurgles mingled with shrill squeals
and occasionally a low growl that rose to a mournful
howl and then died again one would readily imagine
himself rather in a well equipped pet-store than in the
staid and solemn confines of a scientific laboratory

 directed a questioning glance at the doctor and
he sensed my evident astonishment with a knowing
smile he hobbled over to the corner of the room from
which the disturbance seemed to emanate and i followed
expectantly for the first time i now observed a number
of cages similar to those found in bird and animal stores
in one of them some pigeons fluttered about cooing and
gurgling two others contained guinea-pigs while
several colonies of white mice scampered around in ad-
jacent cages other compartments of rather large dimen-
sions were screened so as to hide their inmates from
view but the strange noises that emerged from the re-
cesses of these mysterious cages were sufficient to in-
dicate that they housed some forms of animal life in
captivity

  you might have guessed by now ventured the scien-
tist by way of explanation that the animals constituting
this assorted menagerie are my test-tubes and beakers
my flasks and other chemical apparatus for the experi-
ments which i am constantly performing in other
words i have been enabled by tests and diets admin-
istered to them to work out the vast host of significant
facts in regard to the nature of all diseases to which i
have alluded in my dissertation to you


amazing

stories

  let me demonstrate to you paul just how these
nutritional experiments are performed he directed my
attention to one of the cases containing two groups of
mice separated by a partition

  this is a test which i am making to duplicate the
classical experiment of professor hopkins of cambridge
university it was this experiment that had more to do
in stimulating the modern investigation of the vitamines
than any other single factor that i know of i shall out-
line it to you briefly and in doing so i shall present some
of the more elementary aspects of the subject of vita-
mines perhaps- and a bland smile traversed the
wrinkled features of the old professor i should have
begun my discourse at this point instead of plunging into
the more advanced considerations as i did however
you will have no difficulty in deriving a fairly compre-
hensive working knowledge of the subject so that you
may be enabled when the time comes to present to your
readers with some degree of authoritativeness and ac-
curacy the nature of the discoveries which i shall dis-
close to you

  now look at the six rats in that compartment at the
left-the one marked a compare them with the six
in the b compartment and tell me if you note any dif-
ference

  no great amount of careful scrutinizing was required
to reveal the difference it was stamped unmistakably in
the physical aspect of the two sets of animals

  why doctor it appears evident that the rats of group
a are much smaller and less active and seem to exhibit a
sort of anaemic condition on the other hand the animals
of group b look as though they are extraordinarily well-
nourished and healthy

  exactly rejoined the physician but the remark-
able things about these rats is that at the start of this ex-
periment they were of precisely the same weight and the
same stage of development and more remarkable they
have been maintained during the entire period on an
identical diet with but one trivial exception every day
each rat of group b receives in addition to its usual
food two cubic centimeters of milk equivalent to about
half of a thimbleful

  i marveled at the astonishing results accomplished by
the addition of this insignificant almost infinitesimal
quantity of milk

  now let me go back continued dr beardsley and
recall to you some pertinent facts about nutrition in
general

  up to comparatively few years ago we believed
that our diet was perfect if it contained protein fat
carbohydrates and mineral salts each of these has a
definite function in the body and with a diet comprising
the prime food elements in the proper proportion it
would appear that the human mechanism would continue
to operate at a point of maximum efficiency

  now milk is our most nearly ideal food containing
protein in the form of casein fat in the form of cream
carbohydrates represented by milk sugar and certain es-
sential mineral salts including the bone-building lime
moreover these food elements are also found to be
present in the exact proportion to make an ideally bal-
anced diet hence milk has always been regarded as the
finest kind of food for infants and growing animals

  let us assume however that instead of feeding our
body with milk we supply it with the individual con-
stituents of the milk namely the protein the fat etc
obtained from various sources taking care however to

furnish these nutrients in the exact proportion found in
the original milk with our human engine receiving a
sufficient amount of the best protein obtainable enough
fat and carbohydrate to satisfy the energy and fuel re-
quirements of the body and a sufficient supply of inor-
ganic salts wre ought to thrive as well as we did on the
original milk diet  doesnt that appear to you to be a
reasonable form of argument

  the logic of the case seems to me to be irrefutable
i replied an artificial diet such as you describe ought
to be every bit as wholesome and substantial as the one
made up of milk only

  true continued the doctor and most scientists did
agree that there could be nothing inherently wrong in a
synthetic diet of this sort and yet look at the results
obtained from maintaining these rats on just such a diet
the animals of set a have been fed on an artificial diet
consisting of protein fat carbohydrate and mineral
salts their undernourished and anaemic condition is ob-
vious at a glance on the other hand compare the rats
of set b with them their diet has been identical with
that of the first group consisting of the same synthetic
mixture of food nutrients the only difference being the
addition of two five-hundredths of a pint of milk each
day

  perhaps dr beardsley i ventured a guess the
additional nutrients in the milk added to the diet of the
b rats are responsible for the increased growth and su-
perior health of these animals

  hardly my boy was the scientists prompt re-
joinder as far as the most scrutinizing chemical
analysis could ascertain the minute quantity of whole
milk added to the diet of the b series contained the
exact constituents of the synthetic diet and surely the
actual amount of food and energy material to be found
in the half thimbleful of milk is so inordinately tiny as to
preclude any possibility that the remarkable growth of
the b rats can be ascribed to this additional nutriment

  scientists were therefore led to the undeniable con-
clusion that there must be something present in the milk
other than the four essential nutrient elements already
known to be there and a corollary inference was in-
evitable namely that this mysterious substance must
be present in very minute proportions since the amazing
results exhibited by the rats of group b resulted from
the addition of a very small quantity of milk

  this is in short paul the story of the discovery of
vitamine a the vitamine found in the butter fat of
milk as well as in several other common foods it has
been proved to be the growth-promoting vitamine and
you can readily see what the absence of this essential
ingredient in the diet of the rats in the first group has
effected as far as their rate of development and general
health is concerned

  but doctor i asked timidly if as you say this
experiment is an exact replica of one performed by a
noted professor many years ago to demonstrate the ex-
istence of vitamines is there any particular point in the
repetition perhaps you have in mind some refinement
of manipulation or some totally unsuspected angle of
the question 

  now you have it cried the aged experimenter his
faltering voice rising to a higher pitch as he approached
the subject that was nearest his heart remember that
my chief interest at present is the matter of deficiency
diseases the absence of vitamine a in the diet be-
sides retarding the growth and physical progress of the
vitamine z



organism is as i told you earlier in our discussion re-
sponsible for the development of rickets

  but that is not the only pathological condition result-
ing from a deficiency of vitamine a i want you now
once more paul to examine carefully the rats of group
a namely the undernourished animals and tell me if
you can detect any palpable evidences of the presence
of disease

once again i peered into the enclosure that housed
the anaemic rats they were huddled together in
the centre of the cage listless and inactive apparently
in a somnolent stupor occasionally one of them would
move its head weakly blinking its eyes in a half-hearted
fashion evidently this exertion was too much for it
because it would promptly sink back again into its mor-
bid lethargy without a doubt these animals appeared
to be even to my laymans eyes subnormal but a close
examination of the rats seemed to reveal to me no definite
indications of disease

  i was about to give up and turn to dr beardsley for
elucidation when i happened to take another glance at
one of the little animals as it blinked its eyes weakly
my attention was attracted by a queer reddening and in-
flammation of the rats eyes with a formation of hard
crusts about the lids i also noted a peculiar yellowness
of the pupil while the entire organ appeared to be weak
and lusterless

  looking carefully over the other five members of the
group i found them all to be suffering from the strange
eye malady at various stages in its progress some of
them were afflicted with an accumulation of a sticky
exudate that tended to paste the eyelids together in the
case of two of the rats this sticky material had dried into
a crust which made it difficult for them to get their eye-
lids open one of the little animals appeared to be
suffering from the development of ulcers on the corner
of the eye and it was obvious that the creature was
totally blind

  all the rats were certainly in a bad way with regard to
the state of their eyes this was the pathological condi-
tion no doubt to which the old scientist had reference
i could have kicked myself for nearly tripping up on a
thing which now appeared so ridiculously evident

  i see that your powers of scientifice observation are
becoming more acute chuckled the doctor as he noted
the dawning expression in my eyes that characteristic
eye disease is known as ophthalmia and is a definite
deficiency disease resulting from the absence in the diet
of vitamine a the ailment has been found to develop
as well in human beings although in such cases it is
known as xerophthalmia and sometimes as conjunctivitis
this form of eye inflammation often progresses to the
extent where total and permanent blindness results
you can see for yourself that at least one of my test
animals has reached that point already very often
death results before the blindness stage is attained

  doctor beardsley now hobbled across to a nearby cabi-
net and returned with a small vial containing an oily
liquid of a faintly pink hue together with a device which
i gathered to be a hypodermic needle

  up to the present time he continued all efforts to
isolate the various vitamines have met with no marked
success it is true that my colleagues in this field of
scientific research have with their crude and elementary
methods of experimentation isolated certain materials of
a high degree of activity which are claimed to be im-

pure forms of the vitamines to the best of my knowl-
edge however not one of them has yet been able to say
to the world here is a sample of pure undiluted one
hundred per cent vitamine a and the same applies
equally well to vitamines b c d and e

  however i have after ceaseless effort on the subject
extending over a period of four years at last succeeded
in perfecting a method or rather a series of methods for
detecting isolating purifying and identifying each indi-
vidual vitamine the exact nature of these methods i
am not yet prepared to divulge suffice it to say that i
now have in my possession samples of the five commonly
known vitamines together with eighteen hitherto undis-
covered members of this group of essential food sub-
stances each is in the highest form of chemical purity
and each exhibits the precise physical characteristics of
boiling point melting point and vapor tension as well as
a definite molecular weight to indicate that it is a pure
chemical compound

  and now i am going to demonstrate to you something
of the remarkable therapeutic properties of pure vitamine
a not only is it a preventive for its characteristic
deficiency diseases but it is a cure as well

  dr beardsley then proceeded to draw up one or two
drops of the precious pink liquid into his needle he
chose one of the rats that exhibited an intermediate stage
of the eye disease and prepared a spot on its neck for the
injection taking the usual precautions in regard to anti-
septic conditions then followed a deft jab and the
simple operation was over after which the creature was
replaced with its fellows

  for a brief moment we watched the test animal in
strained silence-the scientist with a look of mingled
anxiety and triumph in his faded eyes-i with a feeling
that a momentous occurrence was about to take place i
expected something out of the ordinary but i was com-
pletely taken back by the startling outcome of the
experiment

  for the space of about ten seconds the rat continued
to drowse with his mates in that characteristic state of
dull torpidity from which it had not even been disturbed
by the intravenous injection of the doctor then it sud-
denly opened its eyes not sluggishly and weakly as be-
fore but with a vivacious snap and i was astonished to
see the sticky secretion and the hard encrustations on the
eyelids slowly melt away in the face of a gentle tearlike
flow that began to bathe the afflicted eyes of the rodent

  but even more remarkable than this almost miraculous
transformation was the change in the physical behavior
of the animal itself it rose to its feet from the crouch-
ing and huddled position that it had occupied with its
neighbors and began scampering about the cage with a
liveliness and vigor that was in sharp contrast to the al-
most deathlike somnolence of the other rats

  even if i had been able to think of something appro-
priate to say at this juncture i was unable to utter a
wrord for sheer bewilderment at the awe-inspiring phe-
nomenon that was taking place before my very eyes
all i could do was to stare in open-mouthed and open-
eyed amazement at the revitalized animal

  and that isnt by any means all these words of
dr beardsley seemed to come booming from afar and
shook me out of my hypnotic trance

  you have witnessed only the very beginning of the
transformation smiled the aged professor within a
few hours the animals metabolism will have been so
altered that it will begin to increase in stature and weight


amazing stories

and will in a short time be comparable in every way with
the healthy and normal rats of group b

the aged scientist walking off a few paces suddenly
dropped into a chair nearby and closed his eyes
his long discourse delivered throughout in a terse force-
ful manner together with the suppressed agitation at-
tending his dramatic demonstration were evidently more
than the enfeebled condition of the doctor could stand
he sat there for the space of several minutes breathing
in short and rapid pants while his seamed face took on
an unearthly pallor

  thus he sat for a brief interval and then the mounting
flush in his sallow cheeks convinced me that he was hap-
pily in no danger he opened his eyes slowly and re-
garded me with a faint smile

  theres no reason for any worry paul came dr
beardsleys reassuring words uttered nevertheless in a
somewhat weak and hollow tone if only i can remem-
ber to curb my insane enthusiasm a trifle and learn to
take things in a moderate and sensible manner this rotten
heart of mine might last me a little longer however i
am all right now my boy

  my dear doctor i expostulated dont you think
you had better postpone the remainder of your very re-
markable demonstration until such time as your physical
condition warrants the exertion i believe that what i
have heard and seen here today will make a sizeable
chunk of scientific news to hand out to our laymen
readers

  dont be silly paul came the prompt retort i
havent even started on my main theme remember that
my primary object in all of this preliminary explanation is
to introduce the real subject of my researches namely
the relation of vitamines to all known ailments regarded
as deficiency diseases of nutrition

  it appeared that the old professor had his mind set
rather definitely on continuing and to tell the truth i
was extremely anxious myself to obtain some additional
facts concerning the real core of his brilliant research
reassured by his rapid recovery from the last attack
and by his promise to tone down his vigorous and ener-
getic style of presenting his precious subject i followed
the doctor back again to the assorted cages containing his
test animals

  there is just one thing more i want to show you
said dr beardsley just one demonstration that will
give you some notion as to the correctness of my vitamine
hypothesis the rest we shall leave for some later date

  of the eighteen new essential substances that i claim
credit for having isolated and tested i am going to try
out for your approval vitamine k my antirabic
vitamine

  he reached into the magic cabinet once more and drew
forth a tiny vial containing about ten drops of a cherry-
colored phosphorescent liquid armed with this as well
as with a small piece of fresh meat abstracted from some
mysterious compartment of his laboratory table he ap-
proached one of-the screened cages this was the one
from which came those queer growling noises that i had
detected as we entered the room

  the scientist drew aside the concealing curtain and
revealed a small dog glaring ferociously at us through
the bars its eyes were bloodshot and watery its mouth
half open and dripping foam its teeth bared in a hideous
grin as the light of day penetrated the enclosure the
mc-d animal made a frightful lunge at the bars and

struggled furiously against them as if to gain his liberty
i drew back in horror as the snarling little brute spattered
his frothy saliva in all directions

  hydrophobia better known as rabies explained the
doctor simply in its most advanced stages too and
as you know a disease that is common to both canines
and humans

  without another word this remarkable man of science
poured the tiny quantity of mysterious liquid over the
piece of meat and flung it into the cage the frenzied
dog relinquished the viselike grip that his jaws had main-
tained on one of the bars and he snapped at the morsel
it disappeared in a single gulp

  in a few seconds came dr beardsleys calm words
the osmotic action through the animals stomach lining
will have caused the vitamine to be absorbed into the
blood capillaries when the substance has been dissemi-
nated through the circulatory system and been transported
to every cell in the body we shall see results

  the results came with lightning suddenness the mad
dog stood staring at us for a brief moment its bleary
eyes glowing dully from their sunken sockets then it
whined weakly turned and slunk to a far corner of the
cage the frothy mucus ceased dripping from its jaws
and in a truly miraculous manner disappeared almost en-
tirely the animal dropped wearily to a recumbent posi-
tion with its head resting on its front paws and its eyes
half-closed as if dozing in less than two minutes from
the time the dog had swallowed the magical substance it
looked no more mad than any sleepy puppy drowsing in
the sunshine in some back yard

  in ecstatic forgetfulness of myself i grasped dr
beardsleys withered hand and shook it so vigorously
that the old man winced and his very frame trembled

  my dear doctor this is marvelous i ejaculated
stupendous almost unbelievable

  the aged physician led me back to his study a queer
subtle smile playing about his wrinkled face

  i trust paul he said that i have shown you enough
today to convince you that i have my finger on the solu-
tion of a human problem as old as the race itself my
life is now dedicated to the extirpation of all of man-
kinds diseases and i am firmly convinced that the
secret lies in the vast field that embraces the vitamines
both known and undiscovered

  now my dear reporter man smiled dr beardsley
wearily ive told you enough for one day for the
present the time is not yet opportune for you to broad-
cast the tidings far and wide keep it strictly to your-
self for just a short while longer tomorrow at three
i should like to have you meet me at the university
hospital and there i promise to acquaint you with some
even more amazing facts concerning the powers of my
little pets these phenomenal vitamines

  

  in the cool and refreshing evening atmosphere out-
doors i strove to get myself to believe that i was not
experiencing some highly fanciful dream the entire
proceedings in the scientists office left me numb with
astonishment at the bewildering revelations and miracu-
lous feats of this superhuman wizard if he could per-
form such unheard-of acts in the case of dumb animals
and their peculiar afflictions what a far-reaching boon
to humanity would he evolve when he applied his magical
vitamines to the host of human ills the very thought
of it was sufficient to stagger my imagination and to
send my intellect reeling in a state of dizzy helplessness
vitamine z



ct have made certain secret arrangements whis-
x pered dr beardsley to me in the lobby of the uni-
versity hospital where we met as agreed at three oclock
the following afternoon dr horton is in accord with
my work and has given me full permission to try out
several of my newer vitamines in the treatment of some
common human diseases

  he pointed significantly to the little black bag he
carried and murmured vitamines j p and r-to-
gether with a few of my more recently isolated ones
he appeared to be shaky and nervous as though he had
not slept the night before or perhaps many nights before
his sunken cheeks were even more sallow than ordi-
narily while deep rings under his eyes indicated long
and wearying labor of a strenuous nature

  perhaps it is unnecessary for me to go into any great
detail as to the phenomenal occurrences to which i was
witness during the course of the next two hours you
need but recall the astounding cases of complete and al-
most instantaneous cure which the old wizard had ef-
fected before my very eyes on the previous day and
multiply them by the necessary factor to bring them up
to the level of human cures you will then obtain a pic-
ture of what transpired in the grim wards of this institu-
tion of human suffering and physical pain when the
demonstration was over i wras breathless and shaken

  we first spent a little time in the childrens ward dr
beardsley tackled at the start an exaggerated case of in-
fantile scurvy a little girl whose body joints had become
inflamed and sore and whose gums exhibited such a
marked swelling and softening that the teeth could almost
be plucked out with little effort within five minutes
from the time that the doctor administered an injection
of his pure vitamine c the child was romping around
and crying to be allowed to go outdoors and play

  an advanced case of poliomyelitis a disease affecting
the spinal cord responded to treatment within three
minutes following an injection of vitamine r in about
ten minutes the little boy was strutting about the ward in
uncontrollable glee entirely oblivious of the fact that for
weeks he had lain helplessly paralyzed from the hips
down-a case of infantile paralysis

  proceeding to other parts of the hospital this extra-
ordinary man left a trail of bewildered patients or i
should say former patients nearly shocked out of their
senses by a heaven-sent cure a virile stage of typhoid
fever answered to treatment so promptly that in ten
minutes the erstwhile sufferer was sitting up and clamor-
ing vociferously for a square meal

  an unfortunate woman in the final eruptive stages of
smallpox was soon up and about in a most energetic
fashion hardly had a hopeless tubercular patient re-
ceived an intravenous injection of vitamine m than he
put in a loud demand that he be given his clothes and
promptly be discharged from the hospital i followed
dr beardsley from ward to ward helping whenever i
could in the manipulation of the treatments standing by
in open-eyed amazement when my assistance was not
required

  finally his supply of precious vitamines was exhausted
i could see plainly that the physicians very meagre re-
serve of vital energy was similarly exhausted his thin
frame trembled alarmingly as i helped him into the wait-
ing cab and he dropped into the cushions with a sigh of
relief

  i could not muster up the proper words with which to
express my feelings at the superhuman demonstration

that i had witnessed presently the weary old man
turned to me and murmered

  there son you have the whole story or i should say
very nearly the whole story just as soon as i have per-
fected means of isolating the remaining vitamines then
i shall have at my command a weapon to wipe out all
known human disease

  his eyes closed wearily ah--vitamine z-vitamine
z he muttered half to himself he appeared to be un-
aware of my presence then with a start his eyes opened
and he regarded me with a queer look his wrinkled old
face broke into a weak smile

  you must forgive this little digression he whispered
i am tired very tired there is more that i must show
you before i am finished but we shall wait a few days
until i have completed my preliminary work you may
expect me to call you for the final instalment of my vita-
mine exposition during the course of a week or two per-
haps longer meantime you will of course breathe not a
word of this to anybody i have enjoined the medical
staff at the hospital to maintain a strict secrecy regarding
my cures this afternoon and they will suppress all news
of my discoveries until the time is ripe for public an-
nouncement

  and when i present the last act in my vitamine drama
i guarantee you that all the other remarkable things which
you have witnessed will pale into insignificance

  i assisted him up the steps of his dwelling and after a
brief good-night i stood listening to his retreating foot-
steps shuffling wearily down the long corridor

  what a genius that man is i muttered meditatingly
positively an anachronism he seems to be centuries
ahead of this age a truly marvelous being a veritable
angel sent by the kind almighty to relieve a suffering
humanity

s   

t itamine z is the very crux of the whole

  v	matter

  again dr beardsleys cracked and high-pitched voice
rose with ill-suppressed excitement as he plunged into his
cherished field

  over a month had passed since the epochal visit that
we had made together to the university hospital al-
though exploding with anxiety and eagerness i had tr
content myself with waiting as patiently as i could under
the circumstances until i finally received a call to come
down to the old doctors quarters in a hurry

  i must have thundered into the solemn and dignified
atmosphere of his laboratory like a western tornado but
i couldnt help it-i was fairly bursting to learn the last
startling facts in regard to this magnificent research
i had not the faintest conception that i was to be startled
ia the manner in which i really was subsequently

  with my first glance at dr beardsley i was dismayed
at the great change that a few short weeks had effected
his humped shoulders had acquired an even more pro-
nounced droop deep lines of anxiety furrowed his face
and his dry parchment-like skin was a sickly yellow
only his eyes seemed to burn under their shaggy brows
with a fierceness that almost frightened me

  yes my dear paul it is true that i have been working
hard-perhaps too strenuously for my poor old heart
but and the doctors face screwed itself up into a
knowing grin i shall soon fix that

  my work is now complete he cried that hopeless
dream of the ancient alchemists that evanescent vision of


amazing stories

ponce de leon the elixir of life i have it in my
vitamine z

  once more the trembling old man led me haltingly
into his laboratory where i had only recently witnessed
those awesome experiments with his test animals

  since last i saw you paul explained the doctor i
have been working night and day on the last great culmi-
nating triumph of my efforts i have isolated and dem-
onstrated all the remaining vitamines that was a simple
task if each of these substances is a preventive and a
cure for a particular human disease then what would a
mixture of them be why a remedy for every known
ailment

  but i soon found that some mysterious influence
operated to vitiate the individual powers of these sub-
stances when mixed together obviously i was on the
wrong track

  so i tackled the problem from a different angle and
now i have it at last vitamine z-the very embodiment
of all the virtues possessed by its host of cousin vitamines
-extracted from the manioc root of the west indies and
south america by a process of refinement that has never
been equalled in the annals of science

  vitamine z will cure any disease known or unknown
but what is the most dreaded of all diseases is it ty-
phoid is it tuberculosis not at all mans greatest
fear is the disease of senility-old age

  is senility a disease the decrepit physician fairly
screamed the question at me most assuredly old
age is nothing more than a progressive weakening and
decay of the vital organs-the heart the blood vessels
the kidneys the lungs the digestive system the glands
the nervous system

  scientists like steinach and voronoff have foolishly
attempted to arrest and cure old age by the transplanta-
tion of glands or the injection of glandular extracts
but their experiments have gone for naught because
they have not attacked the root of the problem as i have

  in vitamine z i possess a substance which will pro-
duce an immediate cure for old age a complete restora-
tion of the diseased vital organs to vibrant health and
consequently a prompt rejuvenation man need no
longer fear the advance of years his usefulness on
earth will be prolonged indefinitely vitamine z will
give us all perpetual existence all hail to vitamine z
the real elixir of life

  for a moment i thought the old man had gone stark
mad his shrieking voice his wild flashing eyes made
me shrink back in a sudden panicky fear

  once more continued the agitated doctor i shall
employ our little rat friends here in a demonstration of
the new vitamine they have been invaluable in all my
experiments and they will not fail me at the end

  with those words he brought forth from one of the
cages and placed on the laboratory table an old rat that
appeared to be in the very last stages of senile decrepi-
tude its head was drooped its half-closed eyes evinced
a haunting fear its hair was shaggy and dull it could
barely totter and after a few feeble steps it collapsed in
a heap and lay panting

 in age explained the doctor in a somewhat modified
tone this animal corresponds to a man of about eighty
as you can plainly observe it is in a pretty sorry state-
in almost as pitiful a condition he added with a dry
smile as my own

  here is a vial of my vitamine z watch the pro-
cedure it is the same as i have employed for you pre-

viously in my tests see-two drops in the hypodermic
needle-there-the operation is over-the animals
blood stream will do the rest

  the doctors trembling fingers wrorked with lightning
speed as he explained then he stepped back to regard
the result having been a witness at all the other thril-
ling experiments i was prepared for absolutely anything

  in almost a flash the old rat struggled to its feet its
head was held high and it seemed to take a lively interest
in the world about it its bodily carriage became erect
and its legs lost their tremblings even its lusterless
coat began to grow smooth and shiny its entire manner
suddenly became keen and aggressive i am certain that
if there had been a cat present in the laboratory the
rejuvenated rat would have done battle with her with
ferocious abandon

  dr beardsley hastily seized the transformed animal
and thrust it back into its cage where it fell to struggling
noisily with the other inmates

  then he turned to me with a beaming smile of victory
his haggard face seared with the lines of endless labor
and anxious ordeals became fairly radiant in his supreme
enthusiasm

  there you have the essential nucleus-the vital heart
of all my laborious work he croaked hoarsely

  vitamine z will eliminate from this earth all disease
all suffering all the infirmities of old age in fact there
can be no old age for with the wiping out of all the con-
tributing pathological and organic conditions that go to
make up senility a human being will never grow old

  and now we come to the supreme test of all and with
that test completed you are at liberty to divulge my great
discovery to the waiting world

  i-i myself am now the subject of the experiment
the old scientist beat his sunken breast with a gnarled
fist as his voice pierced my very innermost conscious-
ness like a fiery lance

  long have i waited and toiled and hoped and the
moment has at last arrived i have played all that i
possess-my health-my very life and now i am pre-
pared to collect my well-earned winning in this greatest
of all gambles

  i had never seen old dr beardsley so wrought up in
all my acquaintance with him i could tell from the un-
natural flush in his hitherto colorless countenance his
rapid breathing and the inordinate flash in the eyes that
were customarily weak and lacking in lustre that there
was a terrific upheaval taking place in this tottering
frame the extreme nervous excitement of this dramatic
occasion was certainly doing the enfeebled man no good

  he still clutched in his boney fingers the tiny vial con-
taining the precious fluid that he had used to rejuvenate
the senile rat he raised it tremblingly to his lips-and
then it happened

  a flash of extreme anguish crossed his face his
features became distorted as if by an unbearable pain
his piercing eyes turned glassy a soul-chilling gurgle
escaped his half open lips his fingers tore convulsively
at his throat

  as his knees sagged and his body swayed i sprang
toward him just in time to catch him as he collapsed in
a heap the tube of vitamine z crashed to the floor and
the life-giving substance was scattered in all directions

very little more remains to be said about the un-
fortunate tragedy heart failure was the verdict
which was handed down by the county medical examiner
vitamine z



after a brief investigation of the sudden death of dr
beardsley in the excitement that attended the dramatic
incident i forgot completely about vitamine z even if
i had had enough presence of mind to try to salvage some
of it from the floor i probably would have been un-
successful the stuff proved to be of such high volatility
that not a trace was left when i got around to a minute
study of the scene so that all hopes for a possible
chemical analysis appear to be shattered

  i took the liberty of making a careful inspection of the
doctors effects his tubes bottles and containers as well
as his personal research notes and writings but to no
avail an expert analyst reported that all of the liquids
which i found in the scientists laboratory were nothing
more than ordinary chemical reagents or solutions the
nature of which were common knowledge to all ex-
perimenters

  his copious notes contained not a single clue that
would reveal even to the slightest degree the methods

the

 which he employed to isolate his wonderful vitamines
 if it were not for the tangible evidences of the revital-
 ized animals in his laboratory cages and the groups of
 hopeless invalids restored to complete health at the
 hospital i should consider the entire matter a weird
 dream 

   the chapter appears to be closed scientists are still
 nibbling patiently in the field of nutritional research
 they know their five vitamines by their effects on the
 body and by their presence in certain foods but the vast
 empire that dr beardsley opened by his astonishing dis-
 coveries lies buried again in ignorance and obscurity
 perhaps some day another genius will arise another phe-
 nomenal experimenter with the uncanny ability of that
 great man

   then it may be that he will rediscover the key to the
 secret of the vitamines and will present to a stricken
 humanity the fundamental facts which will spell for it
 salvation

the radio robbery

 by capt s p meek u sa

         continued from page 

to a spectroscopic test the copper lines were there all
right but they were somewhat distorted and i felt sure
that i was on the right track

  but why should a man want to destroy gold after
he had made it  asked the district attorney

  he wouldnt unless it were so unstable that it was
slowly disintegrating by itself replied the doctor i
suspect that it was am i right wallace

  the prisoner nodded

  my brother made gold all right from copper but
it soon changed back we didnt know what to do
so he suggested that i get a position as express messen-
ger and change a shipment of true gold with our false
gold i did so he knew that his gold would start
to go to copper in a short time and in order to remove
any traces he set his apparatus up near the bank and
kept it going all night

  what sort of an apparatus was it asked the doctor
i dont know the details but it generated an exceed-
ingly short wave that traveled like a radio wave except
that he could control the direction it was made from
an electric spark he thought that he had directed the
waves from the spark straight up but they must have
come down again the short wave he did control it
wouldnt affect real gold but it broke down our false
gold rapidly

  that was the wray i had it figured out replied the
doctor that was why i had that story put in the
paper i thought that when dr wallace saw it that
he would start his machine again and i sent to camp
vail for a radio locator truck to trace its location down
the rest of it you know

  but that doesnt get the gold back remarked mr
fleckner

  i think that i can take care of that said the doctor
frank wallace here is an accomplice all right but he
was not the brains of the steal and i fancy he is thor-
oughly sick of the whole affair i am sure that he had
no hand in the death of barnett

the

  i certainly hadnt broke in wallace and my
brother never intended anything of the sort he was
not a murderer he was all broken up when he heard
of it barnett must have been smoking or else he lighted
a match or something like that

  do you know where the gold is 

  yes i do

  mr fleckner said the doctor in case mr wallace
would agree to lead you to the gold and you found it
intact how would you look at the matter would you
not feel rather disinclined to press a prosecution 

  the president considered the matter in silence for a
few moments

  i think that i would he replied at length

  ill be glad to tell you where it is anyway exclaimed
wallace i dont ever want to see it again

  well remarked the district attorney i guess that
closes the case i wouldnt dare to go to trial with a
yarn like that anyway id be laughed out of court mr
hunter you are released from arrest let me be the
first to congratulate you on your clearance from the
charges that threatened you

  its too bad that miss moulton turned you down
hunter said carnes with a twinkle in his eye

  turned me down asked hunter with a blank
stare

  why i didnt exclaimed alice moulton indig-
nantly

  my mistake remarked carnes with a grin i
thought that she agreed to love me forever if i cleared
you

  i did but you didnt clear him laughed alice in
relief i think that if i love anyone it ought to be
doctor bird

  i am afraid that doctor bird would be more pleased
at that than his wife would be replied carnes in
point of fact id have to relinquish my claims to your
affections even if you offered them i am afraid that
mrs carnes and both of the children would object

beyond the green

        tn the concluding chapters of the sequel to into the green prism mr
         verrill continues the charming thread of his story of the manabis
        village there is no greater mystery in the world than that afforded by the
        wonderful ruins found in south america and this subject is treated by the
        author in an extremely interesting and luminous manner as only this well-
        known author and scientist is capable of doing for ethnology and archaeol-
        ogy are his special branches of science ive doubt whether any questions of
        science which occurred to our readers in the first story were left unanswered
        in this sequel-at least not those questions which were sent to us

illustrated by morey

what before

don alfeo scientist and friend of ramon is much per-
turbed over the ultimate destiny of his friend ramon who
had used the manabinite prism to transfer himself to the minute
manabi village after searching diligently for a while he acci-
dentally learns that an eminent collector of archaeological mate-
rial has left him some mineralogical specimens among which is
a fairly good sized slab of manabinite a scientist of europe
helps to make the prism and don alfeo sets out with an expe-
dition to the spot where he and his friend first saw the manabi
village he finally locates the exact spot and just as he sees
the village and the princess there is a crash and ramon mate-
rializes before him apparently from nowhere when alfeo be-
comes convinced that ramon has really come from the tiny
village and that it is possible with the aid of tiny prisms in
that village to go back and forth at will he accepts ramons
invitation to return with him to the manabi village-which they
do in the manabi village ramon introduces his wife the prin-
cess naliche to his friend later he also introduces him to the
bearded one or high priest who explains the reason for the
hebraic features on the face of wira-kocha their god he also
confirms his idea that some time in the dim past these people
had accidentally struck the necessary vibratory note in the pres-
ence of prismatic manabinite and so reduced the whole village
-people and all-to microscopic size

chapter viii
the manabi prince

ramon had an even greater surprise for me
as nusta entered the great hall wherein we
were seated she was accompanied by a lovely
young girl who carried in her arms a mite of
humanity a bright-eyed chubby pink boy
who kicked and crowed and sucked his thumb ob-
livious of the fact that he was a prince of a microscopic
land ramon grinned at my surprise and naliche
blushed rosily as i glanced from one to the other and
tickled the royal kiddys dimpled cheeks

  what think you amigo of that cried ramon is
it not the most wonderful thing you have seen here
unquestionably i assured him adding with a
glance at naliche with the exception of his mother
and-i finished-a far greater mystery than any of
the handiwork of the ancient races i congratulate you
both with parents combining such remarkable attri-
butes of physical beauty intelligence health delightful
characters and other desirable qualities the scion of the
house of urquin should mature to be a most remarkable
man but at the present moment-admitting for the sake

of argument his good looks-his intellect appears mainly
devoted to attempting to swallow his owm fist due no
doubt to the experimental complex inherited from his
father but seriously what is the little fellows name
ramon and naliche were laughing merrily he have
no name to now replied naliche glancing at me with
her marvelous eyes we have wait to make him the
name my hus-my ramon always he say some time
perhaps his so dear friend may come and we wait so

maybe he can be here to be the-how you call it the-

  padrino godfather supplied ramon yes old
man thats it i have always felt amigo you would yet
come and i wanted my dearest truest friend to be the
godfather of our first born well have old melik
christen him in the temple tomorrow morning but
youve got to find a name for him amigo naliche and i
cannot decide on one

  i chuckled i feel honored i assured them but
isnt christening a somewhat paradoxical expression to
use surely your friend melik is not a christian priest
and i was not aware that in the-er-faith of your an-
cestors ramon there were such personages as god-
fathers

  ramon grinned but i dont think naliche quite un-
derstood my meaning for she glanced with a puzzled
questioning expression from one to the other of us

  they have godfathers all right declared ramon
but of course i said christening in a purely figurative

sense i should have said-

  wira-kochering i suggested with a laugh but
regarding the name must it be in manabi spanish or
english or doesnt it matter 

  he is the some of the urquin and the some of the
quichua and the little of the spanish naliche reminded
me and the-the padrino-he is of the americanos
maybe-blushing prettily-he can the names of all be
given

  madre de dios no exclaimed ramon dont lets
burden the poor chiquito with a string of names like that
i know what tis-ive ten names myself no old man
im leaving the name to you only dont give a name
that none of the people here can pronounce

  hmm i muttered lets see ah-how would

amazing stories

  naliche clapped her hands in delight and her eyes
sparkled but our dear friend he speaks the hualla
she cried oh my ramon why you not told me that
i might speak with him so

  i didnt know it myself confessed ramon

  i grinned i cannot say that i speak it i declared
but i possess some knowledge of the dialect and i
have noticed that the urquin tongue is merely a local
variation of the ancient mother-tongue of peru but
how about the name 

  it is most beautiful naliche assured me now using
her native tongue star of gold ah is he not that 
our star the star of urquin and his skin as golden as

the face of inti oh my dear friend i-- with a

sudden swift movement she stepped forward and before
i realized her intentions she kissed my cheek

  a moment later the priest melik entered i recog-
nized him instantly as the man i had seen conducting
the services in the temple and i studied his face with
interest he was an elderly man-i should have said
about seventy-with large keen and kindly eyes a firm
but sensitive mouth good forehead and a high-bridged
thin aquiline nose a sparse gray wisp of beard was
on his chin and his white hair fell about his shoulders
never had i met him amid other surroundings would i
have taken him for an indian he might have been of
any race of southern europe or an american and i
wondered if the blood in his veins was not largely that
of the ancient wira kocha the bearded one that he
was very fond of both naliche and ramon was evident
from the smile that crossed his wrinkled face and the
light that brightened his eyes as he greeted them and
it was equally obvious that the kiddy-mara-choki
rather-was almost as important to him as to his parents
and he expressed delight at the name i had selected for
the child and at the fact that i could-with some diffi-
culty and stumblingly-converse in his own dialect

  you wouldnt think the old boy was a couple of hun-
dred years old would you  muttered ramon in spanish
as melik turned to speak with naliche

  what i ejaculated nonsense ramon such
tales of extreme age are common among the ameticab
races but are seldom fact-they merely forget the dates
of their birth and keep adding on to their imagined age
not melik amigo  he assured me ive proved to
my own satisfaction hes over two hundred and he may
be five hundred for all i know

  i laughed outright why dont you say he was here
when the reduction of the people took place or even was
contemporary with wira-kocha i asked

  maybe he was replied ramon quite seriously
nothing would surprise me here he hesitated
guess naliches age he said

  that i declared is simple i should say without
hesitation that she is between eighteen and twenty if
she were a native of a northern locality i would add per-
haps two years more

  ramon roared until naliche and melik gazed at him
in surprise and the infant howled in terror then turn-
ing to naliche he said something in words too rapid for
me to follow and instantly both she and the priest burst
into peals of merriment

  whats the huge joke i demanded

  naliche my adored one eighteen or twenty gasped
ramon striving to control himself oh amigo into
thats rich why shes older than i am-yes amigo
older than you you old fossil shes nearly forty

  the joke i observed is that you imagine for one
moment i will believe that statement i presume you will
now assure me that your son yonder s a man of twenty-
five

  but she is insisted ramon you cannot judge the
age of people here by our standards and every birth
for the past-well at least eight centuries-has been
recorded or registered that is the births of all members
of the aristocracy and priesthood they are all on file
in meliks sanctum adjoining the temple-recorded on
quipos the knotted cords used for registering events and
computations-and i looked up that of naliche because
i couldnt believe it even when she told me her age
possibly i suggested you have found the land of
the fountain of youth though if such be the case i
should like you to explain why it is that people die here

ramon was now serious once more of course
 they die he said theyre mortal like anyone else
but they live to extreme age it puzzled me in the be-
ginning but i discovered the reason

  if you can elucidate to my satisfaction and prove
your assertion i may be converted i informed him
what is the mysterious cause of the manabis no the
urquins longevity

  first let me put a question he replied what are
the chief causes for human beings dying at less than one
hundred or two hundred years you as a scientist and
anthropologist must realize that judged by biological
laws and precedents human beings should live normally
for one hundred and fifty years more or less-approxi-
mately five times the period it requires for them to reach
maturity yet how many live to that age and how
many ever die of old age

  naturally diseases cause the majority of deaths i
replied accidents take their toll and death is hastened
in the case of civilized men by excesses lack of care
late hours and a thousand and one other causes but in
answer to your first question i would say that tubercu-
losis cancer and-well possibly malaria are the three
most potent factors in destroying human life prema-
turely that is of course excepting wars pestilences
floods and-as the insurance companies put it-acts of
god

  precisely amigo he agreed and if these diseases
-if all maladies caused by parasitic or deadly germs
could be eliminated why shouldnt people live to one
hundred or more and why shouldnt they keep their
youth into what we call middle age 

  no reason at all i admitted but no one has yet
and the chances are no one ever will eliminate such dis-
eases

  no ramon shrugged his shoulders and raised his
eyebrows in that he continued you are greatly
mistaken here in urquin there are no germ or microbe
diseases that is he hastened to add unless you and
i have brought them in

  nonsense i exclaimed

  nonsense nothing he retorted just use your rea-
son amigo mio remember that we-all the people here
-are according to your former standards tiny ultra-
microscopic beings then considering that point tell
me how it would be possible for germs-say of malaria-
to live in our veins why mi amigo it would be like
tadpoles in the blood of ordinary-sized men

  i smiled you quite forget i reminded him that
when the manabis-no confound it the urquins-
beyond the green prism



were reduced the germs in their systems would have
been reduced also and that their descendants would still
be of reduced size

  granted he retorted but you amigo forget that
the most deadly of germs those of malaria yellow fever
cholera plague and others can be transmitted propa-
gated only by means of carriers-insects and that with
no carriers the breed would soon die out and disappear
completely and that my friend is precisely what oc-
curred here for all i know the original ancestors of
these people may have been entirely free of any injurious
gerins but that makes no difference it happens that
no carriers-no fleas no mosquitoes no bedbugs no
biting insects are here you see the people were in their
temple when the calamity occurred and probably no
insects were present but-

  how about the dog we reduced i asked didnt
he bring fleas with him

  if you recollect he reminded me we had the cur
in my laboratory for a week or more and as i am un-
fortunately or rather was-very susceptible to fleas i
most thoroughly defleaed him as well as my quarters
i doubt if there was a living flea in the place

  hmm i muttered i can understand in a measure
the freedom from diseases of some sorts here but
there are others-smallpox measles tuberculosis cancer
pneumonia scores of virulent maladies that do not re-
quire carriers

  madre de dios exclaimed ramon did not you
yourself assure me that all or nearly all of these were
introduced to america by the europeans and do you
not realize that the urquins were reduced ages before the
first european arrived in america

  even so i argued for i hated to let him know he
had me i fail to see how that fact would enable a man to
live two hundred years or how a girl-er-a woman-
as beautiful and as youthful as your most lovely wife
can be forty years of age

  that admitted ramon is something i do not
know perhaps it is due to the normal healthy life they
lead they do not smoke nor chew coca nor drink
alcohol they sleep twelve hours out of twenty-four
they live an out-of-doors life and they have no worries
no problems no troubles urquin amigo is as near to
utopia as can be found on this earth

  im beginning to think so myself i assured him
but tell me what was it you discovered in regard to
the secret of the cyclopean architecture i am more
interested in archeological matters than in eugenics or
perpetual youth you know

  the same old don alfeo laughed ramon a slave
to your pet science but i cant blame you you havent
the same interests here as i have

  if i said i could find a-er-companionable young
girl as beautiful-no that is imposible but let us say
quite reasonably lovely and well possibly not more than
sixty or seventy years of age-and provided she were
not adversely iinfluenced by personal appearances i
might-well i might consider acquiring much the same
interests as you possess here

  ramon laughed merrily very possibly you may find
that that is just what will happen he declared old
melik has a really charming daughter though i doubt if
she is much over fifty and having had ample opportunity
of judging what a most excellent husband i have proved
i imagine that mosock nina might be tempted to try the
experiment of acquiring a mate from the outside world

youll have an opportunity to judge of the-er-girl of
fifty summers this evening naliche is a born match-
maker and meliks daughter will dine with us

  i smiled hmm mosock nina i murmured
that i believe if freely translated means new fires
a somewhat ominous name for a young lady who is seek-
ing a husband ah well possibly she may kindle new
fires in an old bachelor after all but come lets have
your revelations regarding the prehistoric stone-cutting
im impatient to hear about your discoveries and by
the way just how did you discover it i have seen no
stonework of any size-certainly nothing of the cyclopean
type here

  had it from old-from your prospective father-in-
law he replied with a sly nudge in my ribs he had it
from his father and so on-handed down like all the his-
tory here from father to son among the priests and i
feel certain its the truth for it answers all the require-
ments of the case but well have to wait until later old
man here comes your future bride

chapter ix

woman the enigma

possibly under the circumstances it may be
both ungallant and inadvisable to admit it but this
being a true and unvarnished narrative of actual
events i must not evade facts iri short i must admit
that mosock nina did not at first glance stir any of the
new fires her name implied but of course with na-
liche for comparison no woman would have appeared
unusually beautiful also very possibly-though quite
unconsciously-i was influenced by having-also uncon-
sciously surrounded myself with a defensive armor if i
may use the simile of determination not to fall a victim
to any womans wiles or appearances mosock nina was
however a really beautiful woman although ramon
had declared she was at least fifty i could not even after
his lucid and quite reasonable explanation believe she
was more than twenty-five or six her skin was of much
the same shade as naliches a soft warm golden hue
which was not surprising as it developed that the two
women were cousins her hair was very luxuriant and
soft and although black it showed brown or reddish
even golden tints in the light her features were those
of her father softened and refined by youth and femi-
ninity her eyes were large soft and expressive and her
figure was superb in any other place and amid any
other surroundings i should have felt-as i afterwards
felt-that she was a most gloriously lovely woman and
i soon found that she was as merry as companionable
and as delightful as any man might wish and she quite
obviously did not judge by appearances only for she
appeared quite-i might say decidedly-interested in me
in fact to cut a long story short before the evening or
i might say afternoon for darkness in urqui meant bed-
time i found quite to my surprise and somewhat to my
dismay that i had fallen deeply in love with mosock
nina and if i could judge of the matter that my feelings
were reciprocated i do not think it essential to my
narrative to dwell upon the subsequent events nor to
describe matters that i feel hold no interest for any
others and which to my mind were strictly of a private
nature

  i must confess however that during the ensuing
weeks i found that my interest in archeology became
much to my surprise a matter of secondary considera-


amazing stories

tion and i quite agreed with that anonymous personage
who advised that if business interfered with pleasure
one should give up business nevertheless i did not
entirely neglect my research work and even dragged my
mind from thoughts of mosock nina and kept ramon to
his promise to tell me of his discovery regarding the pre-
incan cyclopean architecture as some of my readers
may not be familiar with this subject a few words of
explanation may not be amiss

  throughout the interior of peru and bolivia are the
remains of immense cities huge forts massive walls and
great buildings all constructed of stones of such stu-
pendous size that they appear as if erected by a race of
giants often these stones weigh from thirty to two hun-
dred tons and even more and all are fitted together with
such incredible nicety and precision-even where there
are as many as twenty angles-that although no mortar
nor cement was used a knife blade cannot be inserted
between them today

  that they were erected by a highly civilized and cul-
tured people who lived and vanished ages before the
incan civilization is evident for even the incans had no
traditions or history of their origin but attributed them
to the gods and for years since archeologists first
studied the peruvian remains they have proved a puzzle
and an unsolved mystery to all scientists no one ever
has been able to offer a plausible theory to explain how
they were cut and fitted how they were transported from
the distant quarries or by what means they were lifted
-without the aid of modern machinery-and placed in
position

  hence ramons casual statement that he had solved
the mystery of the cyclopean architecture as it is called
and his assurance that he knew the secret so long un-
solved filled me with the most intense interest an inter-
est that was not entirely submerged in my sudden and
wholly unexpected interest in mosock nina and i
listened to ramons words when at last i pinned him
down to his promise and he told me of his truly amazing
and altogether incredible solution of the mystery

  you remember amigo he said that i once declared
-when we were in manabi-that i had a feeling the
minute gold beads and the titanic stones had some con-
nection 

  i nodded assent but that is ridiculous i declared
there are no such immense stones in the neighborhood
of manabi

  dont interrupt-miigo mio  he smiled and dont
declare anything ridiculous judged from the point of
view of your fellow scientists your own status at the
present time-if described to them-would be dubbed
impossible and ridiculous nothing amigo is impossible
nor ridiculous in this world unless it controverts the laws
of nature and as none of us know what these laws
are we are wholly incompetent to judge of what is and
what is not impossible anyhow as i was about to say
i was not so far of in my hunch as you might call it
there is not i may assure you in order to set your mind
at rest any real connection between the microscopic gold
beads which-thank god-were the indirect means of my
present happiness and the cyclopean stonework but
there is a very definite connection between the manner in
which the beads were made and the stones were cut and
placed it--

  again i interrupted him you mean the stones were
permanently enlarged after cutting i suppose

  no on the contrary just the reverse he replied
the stones at cuzco and elsewhere are today their
original size or very near it they were permanently
physically magnified cut and fitted and then reduced
to their normal dimensions

  i snorted thats going too far ramon i objected
in the first place you proved conclusively that minerals
-nothing not an animal substance-could not be reduced
by manabinite prisms take your fiddle my clothes
the dogs plate you tried and failed and--

  hold on he exclaimed like all scientists you are
jumping at conclusions i was not i confess able to
reduce objects not composed of animal matter but that
does not prove that had i enlarged such objects i might
not have found that the prism would reduce them to
their original or normal size and how do you or i
know that under certain conditions or when subjected
to some peculiar vibratory stimulant manabinite might
not be capable of reducing any material to the same ex-
tent that the prisms we employed reduced animal
matter 

  hmm i muttered i see your point possibly you
are right but everr so-even if the ancients increased
the size of the stones to any extent i fail to see why it
would facilitate cutting or fitting them on the contrary
i should declare without the least hesitation that it would
render the task even more difficult no human beings
could move one of those two-hundred-ton blocks if it
were three or four times as large and to cut and fit a
large stone is far more difficult than to do the same
work on a small stone no no ramon your explanation
so far is not logical

he smiled condescendingly your reasoning is en-
tirely wrong he declared first let me ask you
a few questions what is weight why are some sub-
stances lighter than others why for example is sand-
stone lighter than flint why is marble softer than
granite 

  why why i stammered suddenly realizing it was a
rather difficult matter to give a wholly satisfactory reply
weight my dear boy is a-well a-a term used to
express the comparative-well weights of various sub-
stances it is-why the comparative pull of gravitation

upon various materials and bodies it-

  wait a bit he interrupted accepting your some-
what lame explanation of weight in the abstract how
may i ask is weight established 

  why by specific gravity i replied by-

  and interrupted ramon why does one object have
a greater specific gravity than another why does one
material float on water while another sinks 

  any schoolboy could answer that i retorted the
object that floats if pushed under displaces a volume

of water exceeding its own weight it-

  and i might state that your answer is no more spe-
cific than the gravity you are prating about he declared
interrupting my sentence you go around and around
in circles you get no nearer the truth the fact is
that weight as you call it is all bunk its all a matter
of relativity and its relativity depends entirely upon
the degree of space-i say space in a broadly compara-
tive term only for of course there is no such thing as
space--between the atoms of which the material is com-
posed if the atoms electrons or whatever you please
to call the objects that form all substances are pressed
beyond the green prism



closely together we have a dense heavy material if
they are widely separated we have a porous light
material

  and when i say dense or porous i mean dense or
porous and not hard or soft as a rule i admit the
dense material is far harder than the porous material
but there are exceptions gold and platinum are very
dense yet they are soft whereas certain forms of glass
and certain minerals may be porous light and exceed-
ingly hard but invariably the dense substances are as
you would express it heavy and the porous substances
are comparatively light you know that yourself the
porous woods are light the dense woods heavy and in
cases where the usual rule is borne out the dense object
is the harder but even in cases where the dense object
is comparatively soft-as in the case of lead tin copper
gold platinum etc the material would be far softer if
it were rendered more porous lead or gold for ex-
ample if as porous as-well say wood-would be as
soft or softer than putty in fact i doubt if the adhesion
of the atoms would be sufficient to hold them together
they would probably disinegrate completely but that
amigo has no real bearing on my discovery the pith of
the matter is this if a normally hard dense substance
could be so altered that the atoms composing it were sep-
arated it would become a porous and soft substance
would it not

  i should not care to express a definite opinion in re-
gard to that i evaded but assuming it to be a fact
what of it

  everything he retorted you can break soft
sandstone with your fingers but you can make no impres-
sion upon granite without a steel tool why because
in one case you have a porous rock with loose structure
while  in the other case it is a dense rock with closely
pressed together structure but if by some means you
could separate the molecules of the granite to the same
extent that those of the sandstone are separated you
could crumble the granite as readily as you can the sand-
stone do you admit that 

  i nodded assent but i was not sure he was right

  fine amigo he ejaculated for once you cannot
raise a valid or an invalid objection based on what you
call science but to proceed that my friend was
precisely what the builders of cyclopean architecture
did they expanded the stones of hard dense refrac-
tory rock until they were porous soft and could be
worked with the greatest ease then they reduced them
to normal size that was all

  but i cried you completely forget that if the
andesite or arsenite or granite was enlarged until your
hypothetical cutting became possible the stones would be
too cumbersome far too heavy to handle

  ramon burst into laughter back to the old school-
boy ideas of weight he exclaimed havent you just
admitted that weight was basically a matter of compari-
son of the specific gravity as you call it havent you
admitted that if a substance floated on water it was light
if it sunk it was heavy that if it was porous it would
float if dense it would sink in that case amigo how
could the same block of andesite even if enlarged to
ten times its size one hundred one thousand times its
size be any heavier than the original block

  good lord i gasped im beginning to see con-
cisely put you mean that the enlarged block would con-
tain no more material-no more atoms of material than

the original by heavens ramon i never thought of
that i do believe you may be right but-but why if
you are if an enlarged mass of stone would be light in
direct relation to its size-in other words if its displace-
ment were greater than its weight of water it would
actually float by jove ramon that might solve another
mystery how the tiahuanacans transported their stu-
pendous stones across lake titicaca why man alive
if they were first enlarged as you suggest they could
have been rafted across as easily as logs

  ramon was grinning of course they could and
they were he assured me and if you dont believe
it i can prove it to you but to go on with my tale of

discoveries i-

  wait hold on i cried as a new thought entered
my mind your theory cant be right its a poor
rule that doesnt work both ways if a stone enlarged
would weigh less then a stone a body anything reduced
would weigh more and if enlarging the stone renders it
more porous then reducing it would render it more dense
in that case your body and mine would be as dense as
hard as diamond and we would weigh thousands of
pounds each

  ramon fairly choked with laughter at my serious ex-
pression as-quite without realizing it-i pinched myself
as if testing the density and hardness of my flesh

  my dear dear old friend he said havent i just
been at some pains to explain that the enlarged stone is
no lighter than in its original size it weighs precisely
the same but as it has a greater cubic volume its weight
as expressed in your units based on specific gravity
appears less if water were to be enlarged to the same
extent you would find the stone sank as quickly as it did
in its normal state in normal water and if a steel tool
were enlarged in the same ratio it would be as difficult
to cut the stone with it as it was when in its original form
its all a matter of relativity my friend the stone is
enlarged out of all proportion to its surroundings hence
the results the same holds true in the matter of reduc-
tion with one exception the same laws do not hold
when it comes to the action of manabinite on animal
matter why i do not know it is one of the many
phenomena connected with the crystal possibly the
atoms that form animal matter are of a different charac-
ter from those of mineral and other substances and hence
are reduced to the same extent as the objects they form
or possibly manabinite does not affect them the same
way all i know is that it is so but as a matter of
fact i believe we weigh precisely what we weighed be-
fore we were reduced i--

  it was my turn to laugh and i did the idea even the
thought of a man of normal weight and only some thou-
sandths of a millimeter in height is i declared highly
amusing ramon and i suppose you claim that mosock
nina tops the scales at some one hundred and ten pounds

more or less i-

  if we had scales in the same proportion to ourselves
as those to which you are accustomed are to ordinary
humans i have no doubt you would find you weigh
around one hundred and seventy pounds and that your
fiancee can boast of some one hundred and twenty
pounds of feminine loveliness in other words mi
amigo your specific gravity in the water of urquin would
be precisely the same as in the waters of new york if
you were of your normal dimensions

  bosh i cried maybe youre all right and maybe


amazing stories

not its all too dashed complicated too theoretical too
involved and too puzzling to bother my head over it fll
occupy my mind with something that is neither compli-
cated nor theoretical and much pleasanter if--

  meaning mosock nina i presume he interrupted
with a grin in which case he added let me warn
you that you will find by experience that nothing you
have yet heard or seen can possibly equal the complica-
tions of a womans mind and that nothing is so puzzling
as a woman

  i gave him a withering look and hurried off to find
mosock nina	

chapter x

ramon proves his point

it was not until some time later after thinking over
ramons statements that i thought i found some
flaws in his arguments if the stones had been en-
larged as he claimed why i reasoned would their atoms
not be correspondingly enlarged and if they were
then the enlarged stone would be as hard and dense as it
was in its original form it was quite obvious too that
his statement that in urquin water we or i would have
the same specific gravity as i formerly had in comparison
to normal water must be wrong he admitted and i
knew that in the case of animal matter the atoms com-
posing it were proportionately reduced and he had ex-
plained that the molecules of water falling as rain in
urquin were incalculably small in proportion to ordinary
molecules yet the water in urquin had not been re-
duced and how then could it bear the same relation to
me or to him that ordinary water would bear to ordi-
nary men 

  the whole thing puzzled me tremendously and i lay
awake the greater part of the night trying to coordinate
the facts in my brain and to find some logical explanation
of it all but when in the morning i mentioned my
thoughts and my inability to grasp or explain the seem-
ingly paradoxical and wholly contradictory matters he
merely laughed and declared that it was a pure waste of
time and nerves to bother trying to straighten it out
that we would have to accept facts as they were and it
was no more use striving to understand the inscrutable
ways of nature than endeavoring to understand the
equally incomprehensible ways of women a statement i
reflected that hinted that his path of love and of marital
bliss was not wholly free from the ruts and thorns of
others but i was not to be put off so readily i pos-
sess a rather prominent bump of stubbornness when it
comes to baldly accepting theories without prima facie
evidence of their truth and i am something of a fiend
on the subject of demonstrations so i very promptly
informed ramon that while he might be willing to ac-
cept things as they were or rather as they appeared
to be and though he might feel convinced that his expla-
nation of the mystery of the cyclopean architecture was
the correct one i had my doubts and was not at all ready
to accept his explanations

  you always were a most skeptical chap amigo he
informed me but theres nothing i enjoy more than
convincing a person against his will i remarked yester-
day that i would prove my theory true-or at least prove
my contention in regard to the stones and ill keep my
promise i do not know precisely what process the pre-
incas used and melik who gave me the facts about the

stones couldnt explain very clearly but working along
my own lines and with what he had divulged to guide
me i managed to invent a process that works at least to
a certain extent and ill give you a demonstration
fine i exclaimed i may be skeptical but once i
see a thing with my own eyes i am willing to be con-
vinced of anything

  so i observe he remarked with a leer you were
quite convinced of mosock nina once you had seen her
with your own eyes and--

  she is most convincing i interrupted and if you
can show me anything in support of your theory that is
one-half as convincing as my future wife i am willing
to accept all your seemingly preposterous explanations
youll find a woman is a darned lot more convincing
after marriage than before he remarked dryly but
come on there is no time like the present you know
rather to my surprise for he had not mentioned it i
found that ramon had quite a complete laboratory in
one wing of the big rambling palace of course he
lacked many instruments and appliances that ordinarily
are considered essential but his marvelous inventive
genius the skill and patience of the urquins and his own
mechanical skill had served to provide makeshifts and
substitutes that were both serviceable and clever very
evidently his experiments had been mainly in the lines of
physics and optics-his own specialties-and equally
obviously he had devoted most of his time to experiments
with manabinite for partly finished broken and dis-
carded lenses prisms and fragments of the mineral were
scattered about in profusion but of course this was to
have been expected for as he told me he had worked
assiduously and almost constantly to produce prisms
capable of enlarging himself to normal size whenever i
might appear and as i glanced about at his instruments
and his store of the green crystal it occurred to me that
had he so desired he might have enlarged not only him-
self but naliche and all the people at the same time and
i wondered why he had not done so but when i put
the question to him he seemed surprised

  why should i  he demanded would we-they-
be any better off no amigo on the contrary they
would be far worse off what would we gain we are
happy contented safe here why should i transfer
myself and my adopted people to a world of which
they know nothing to a status in which they would
be lost  and why should i sacrifice them to the dangers
the discontent the unhappiness of life and civilization as
we knew it and amigo mio think of the effects of
disease through generations of freedom from ail
microbe diseases these people have lost the power to
resist germs and the most ordinary ills-measles colds
whooping cough or any others might prove fatal and
utterly destroy them

  but i objected there is no future no progress
here and at any instant the village and all of you may
be totally destroyed a flood an earthquake a shovelful
of sand some burrowing animal or insect might wipe

out urquin and every one of its inhabitants and-

  as i once said before the same is equally true of
existence in the world of everyday men and women he
interrupted and we do not face the dangers of one
thousand-and-one things that other people have to guard
against as for progress and the future as you call
them-uttter rot what is progress merely another
name for discontent making life and the world more
beyond the green prism



and more complicated more and more dangerous more
and more unhappy are people any better off any hap-
pier with motor-cars than they were with horses and
carriages  are they healthier or more at peace when
able to travel around the earth in a month than when it
required twice that time to cross the atlantic do air-
planes bring any real advantages to mankind  are you-
the people of today-any happier any more contented
any better off as far as peace of mind and body are con-
cerned than were our ancestors fifty one hundred years
ago  i say no for dios we are far worse off the
more people have and the more they know the more they
want and demand it is a vicious circle the laborer
demands more to get more he forces his employer to
pay him more his employer raises the price of necessi-
ties and luxuries to enable him to make his profit and
yet pay his help more and as a result the artisan is as
badly off as ever but he is caught in the mesh of what
you call progress and goes on demanding and receiving
more paying out equally more getting more and more
discontented more sour more unhappy madre de dios
where will it all end this thing called progress and
the worst of it is it gets nobody anywhere boiled down
to its basic elements all man gets out of life is his food
his shelter protection from the elements and amusements
that do not amuse he-

  hold on ramon i ejaculated how about knowl-
edge spiritual life health longevity comforts

he laughed sarcastically of what use is your so-
called knowledge if it cannot make life brighter or
happier he demanded and as for life ill stake my
life that there is truer purer more enduring love right
here in ur quin or among primitive savages than you can
find in new york london paris or anywhere in your
progressive civilizations spiritual life santisima
madre amigo you amuse me what spiritual life have
your progressives that we in urquin lack nothing
we have our faith our religion our gods and we be-
lieve in an after life in souls in a creator and we live
according to the tenets of our religion which is more
than you can say of your civilized people

  comforts pah is a new york hotel or steam-
heated flat any more comfortable than this mud palace
is the indigestible menu of a parisian restaurant any
more delicious than the food we have here are the
ridiculous costumes of your progressive men and women
as sensible and comfortable as our clothes and as for
health and longevity-caramba don alfeo where do
you find men in civilized progressive lands still in their
prime of life at the age of two hundred years and
where will you find beautiful girl-like ladies of fifty
and do you notice a hospital here  do you see doctors
shingles on the houses have you seen an ill maimed
lame unhealthy weak or ailing person in urquin no
no a thousand times no mi amigo we are immeasur-
ably better off happier more contented healthier than
we could be if in the same world as your progressive
civilized people but enough of this let me prove my
statements about the stones

  as he spoke he adjusted a number of crude yet deli-
cate instruments on a table or stand selected several
crystals arranged these with great care and then picked
up a small slab or fragment of stone and handed it to me

  as you will see he began in the tone he once used
in the lecture-room you hold a fragment of arseno-

pyrite rock or mispickel i would ask that you examine
it with your pocket-lens and also that you test its hard-
ness by means of this bronze too he handed me a
chisel-like instrument then kindly drop the stone in
this vessel of water ah as you see it sinks to the
bottom instantly also you find the bronze too makes
no impression upon the mineral and your examination
by your lens has revealed a stone of fine dense structure
do you agree to all this

  i laughed i am not ramon a freshman in a class-
room i reminded him neither the lens the chisel
nor the wrater were necessary to convince me that it is
arsenopyrite that a bronze instrument will not cut it and
that it will sink howrever-

  he grinned but i only wanted to be sure that no
question arose in your mind now he continued as he
took the stone and placed it on a second stand between
two of his instruments watch what happens

  as he spoke he picked up a contrivance something
like the old bull roarers of my boyhood days a stick
or rod to which a string or cord bearing a weight was at-
tached and whirled it rapidly about a low buzzling
hum resulted that increased in volume as he swung the
thing faster and faster until the sound was deafening
and the air vibrated in my ears it wtas more like the
sound of an airplane propeller than anything else but
with a sharper more highly pitched note that reminded
me of the song of gigantic cicada and that seemed to go
through and through me like an electrical di-scharge for
an instant the hum remained the same then suddenly
as it soared in a high crescendo and i gasped and started
back as there was a crackling explosive detonation from
where the stone had been placed a shower of brilliant
sparks seemed to issue from the mineral and it was en-
veloped in a smoke-like vapor it was precisely as if
a bunch of good-sized firecrackers had been set off on
the stone

  instantly ramon dropped the whirling stick the hum
ceased and he turned to me grinning nice fireworks
he remarked and made without fire at that but just
have a look at the stone amigo

  i could scarcely believe my eyes where the little
slab had been-a piece of stone perhaps an inch square
rested an immense block of stone twice as high as my
head reaching across the entire width of the room and
fully six feet in thickness it was the most incredible
the most uncannily mysterious happening i had ever seen

  but my amazement had only commenced i stepped
forward and examined the mass of stone and uttered
an ejaculation of inexpressible wonder instead of a
dense fine-grained mineral i was looking upon what
was apparently coarse schist or sandstone ramon grin-
ning like a cheshire cat handed me the bronze chisel
as if in a dream i grasped it and chipped with it at the
stone at the first blow a large flake flew off and i
found no difficulty in scoring and cutting the stone even
with the soft metal tool

  now amigo mio do you believe exclaimed ramon

  i sank weakly upon a bench mopped my forehead and
stared at the stone as if expecting it to take wings and
vanish good lord i managed to exclaim at last its
a fact ramon youre right i take back all i said
but-

  you were about to say but can i restore the stone to
its original status he broke in as if reading my
thoughts yes amigo i can and i will

  again he adjusted his instruments made some altera-
tions and once more swung the humming device this
time however the note-whether caused by the motion
or by some change in it-was much heavier duller a
sort of booming like that made by the ruffed grouse
when drumming and there was no fireworks display
instead there was a single rending crash like that of
a heavy object dropped upon old bottles and before my
incredulous eyes i actually sazv the great stone shrink
writhe and dwindle until with the final note of ramons
instrument it remained stationary-the tiny fragment of
what was now hard stone

  and now amigo to prove there is no trickery and
that all is as i said will you look carefully at the bit of
mineral you will find i think the marks you made
with the chisel are quite distinct upon it

  he was right there were the scratches the cuts the
spot where i had flaked off a bit of stone i was
speechless there was nothing i could say i could not
find words to adequately express my indescribable amaze-
ment at his seemingly supernatural and impossible feat

chapter xi
melik makes a decision

it was not long after ramons astounding demonstra-
tion that i was married to mosock nina as i be-
longed to no particular denomination and have ever
been liberal and broad-minded in religious matters i
felt that a wedding consecrated by melik in the temple
was quite as orthodox as any other it was a really im-
posing ceremony and i fear that-if i tell the truth-i
must confess that my mind strayed more than once from
the marriage service in its relation to myself and my
bride to dwell upon the fascinating and valuable scien-
tific interests it presented and somehow it seemed ex-
ceedingly dream-like and unreal not to say incongruous
for me a staid twentieth-century american scientist to
be standing in an ancient pre-incan temple before the
image of the sun-god and listening to the aged priest
chanting the words of the ancient hualla marriage cere-
mony while all about stood the reverent people who
might well have stepped from the days of the long-for-
gotten past and as melik raised his arms and called
upon the sun-god to bestow his blessings upon us and i
cast a glance at the motionless sphinx-like figure of
wira kocha in his niche the calm benign face seemed to
smile and i could have sworn that the mummy actually
winked

  of course during all this time ever since i had been
in urquin in fact i had been constantly making new
and most noteworthy discoveries with ramons help
i had invented and made a notebook using the thin
membranous tissues of a most remarkable animal for
the parchment pages and on this i had recorded brief
accounts of my discoveries and in this connection i
must not forget to mention that in urquin all forms of
both animal and plant life were wholly different from
anything i had ever seen

  i am no zoologist and know very little of botany and
hence cannot classify nor adequately and scientifically
describe the strange beasts and plants of the place in fact
i am not at all sure whether all the creatures belonged
to the same order or whether several orders were repre-
sented but all were insect-like in appearance although
many were in some respects like crustaceans and as i

believe that true insects are distinguished in one respect
from the crustaceans by having six legs i am convinced
that if they were insects they were entirely distinct from
any heretofore known whether any were forms that had
been reduced along with the people or whether all were
inconceivably minute forms that have always existed i
cannot say but the interesting point is that they fol-
lowed very closely the habits characteristics and traits of
our fauna some were carnivorous others herbivorous
some were diurnal others nocturnal and while the flesh
of some was edible and extremely palatable and highly
prized that of others was not considered fit to eat
many were most grotesque in appearance others were
horrible others were indescribably beautiful particu-
larly was this last attribute true of bird-like creatures
that i can best compare to sphinx-moths but whose
wings instead of being covered with scales or down as
in our moths were of satiny tissue most brilliantly
tinted with iridescent or opalescent hues

  it was this membrane or skin that was used by the
people for their garments and these creatures alone
of all the fauna had been domesticated or at least were
bred in captivity by the people there were not how-
ever any dangerous venomous nor harmful creatures in
the place and the people were as ramon had stated en-
tirely free from the pests vermin and noxious insects
which are such plagues to other inhabitants of the earth

  the plant life i think was entirely confined to moulds
or fungi plants were not abundant and where there
was cultivation the edible varieties were most intensively
cultivated there were no seeds nor grains as we know
them the plants propagating their kinds by means of
spores and spreading roots and the edible portions con-
sisted of shooots stems leaves and in some cases en-
larged tuberous root-stalks taken all in all i was
amazed to find how closely the life the customs the
entire system of existence followed our own and yet was
totally different it followed on parallel lines at every
turn there were analogous details and conditions and yet
in no case-or at least in very few-were there identical
details the more i saw of the place and the people the
more i was impressed with the truth of the time-honored
hypothesis that like conditions beget like results and that
no matter what their environment or their resources
human beings will eventually arrive at nearly the same
results in one place as in another in fact i often won-
dered if we could but visit the planets whether we would
not find that their inhabitants while differing in details
of life wrere after all very similar to ourselves and if a
man suddenly transported to mars or venus would
not in a very short time adapt himself to conditions
and feel perfectly at home

  and then i wondered if such a person regardless of the
extreme interests he might have in his surroundings re-
gardless of the fact that he might be better off than on
earth would not at times long to return to his own people
and his own home i felt quite certain that he would for
unconsciously at first but with ever increasing desire i
found myself longing to return to my original normal
state possibly my desire was actuated by the inerad-
icable longing that all true scientists posses to make
public my discoveries

  but whatever the underlying cause-and i must con-
fess that i was happy that i had every comfort and
everything that any man might reasonably ask-i was
to use a trite expression homesick and had it not
beyond the green prism



been for my wife whom i literally adored i should have
begged ramon to enlarge me and-though it would have
been with deep regret-i would have bid farewell to
urquin to him and to naliche but the mere thought
of losing mosock nina was unbearable and even should
she consent to being enlarged with me i felt that away
from her friends and family and the surroundings and
life to which she was accustomed she would be far from
happy or content but i soon found as ramon had so
truly said that man never can fathom a womans mind
even if that woman is his wife

  she had always been intensely fascinated by my de-
scriptions of the outer world of my former life and of
our civilization she would listen open-eyed and with
parted lips to my words and finally she astounded me
one day by begging me to take her with me and return
to the world i had left

in vain i argued against her mad scheme although i
fear a bit half-heartedly but nothing i could say
would sway her from her purpose her feminine cu-
riosity had been aroused and womanlike she refused
to listen to logic although i must qualify that statement
somewhat for i am convinced from carefully analyzing
my wifes idiosyncrasies as well as those of other women
i have met since i have been married that womans mind
is not constructed on logical lines however that is
aside from my story

   in vain i pointed out all that ramon had said in sup-
port of his refusal to restore all the urquins to our nor-
mal proportions i assured her she would be unhappy
discontented and would long to return to her people i
might as well have talked to the mummy of wira kocha
in the temple sickness disease all the dangers and
perils of our everyday life were so totally unknown and
incomprehensible to her that she did not even grasp their
meaning or their importance as for death-that was
nothing as long as i died too so we would not be parted
in hamak pakak the urquins heaven and the instant
i mentioned being parted from her people she clapped
her hands and danced with delight it would be won-
derful to go out of urquin to live in my world and to
come back and tell of all her wonderful adventures
that such a thing would be impossible she refused to
believe ramon and i had managed it ramon had
gone and had returned so why couldnt we it was
useless to declare that there was no manabinite she
seemed to think the crystal could be made by ramon or
by myself and-sly little woman that she is-she knew by
womans intuition that i had been more or less homesick
and longing to return to my former state for some time
then she petted and caressed pouted and pleaded by
turns until finally at my wits end i told her i would
leave the decision to her father and to naliche

  in the presence of melik naliche and of course
ramon i stated the case not without difficulty for
mosock nina interrupted constantly ramon looked
very thoughtful and sad naliches eyes sparkled yet i
instinctively saw no support from her quarter and old
melik listened intently stroking his thin beard nodding
his head from time to time and reminding me of a ven-
erable judge listening to evidence in a divorce case

  ramon was the first to speak when i ceased my plea
he used the same arguments he had given me and added
that he had never thought that after having tried to
rejoin him for over a year i should be so ready to leave

him poor fellow he was deeply moved and for the
time i rather prayed that the decision of the triumvirate
would be adverse

  then melik spoke wisdom my son he declared
judicially and almost as if pronouncing sentence upon
me is the gift of the gods unto thee the gods have
given wisdom unto our prince he indicated ra-
mon husband of the divine queen of urquin has been
given even more and i the high priest of urquin-
melik amautu was blessed by the gods with rare wisdom
yet wisdom my son grows and flowers only when it is
nurtured in good soil and becomes a stalwart tree by
years of growth hence my son i who have lived many
times thy years have more wisdom than thou my son
or even than our adored prince yet such is not the
case i have great wisdom of our gods of our race of
our history of many things but my son and our god-
sent prince tells of many things of which they have wis-
dom and of which i know nothing my son makes the
symbols that speak unto another my son knows much
of other people of whom i know not the names my son
has dwelt in another world that to me is as unknown as
the heavens where dwell the gods and i though i am
no longer a youth i had to smile at the centuries-old
priests words would learn something of my sons wis-
dom ere i pass to my fathers i too my son would go
with thee and my daughter into that world beyond

  i gasped it was bad enough to have to stand out
against my wife but here was the old priest expressing
his desire to be transformed to ordinary human size
my thoughts were interrupted by naliche who with
as much enthusiasm as mosock nina had exhibited in-
sisted that she too would accompany us in our proposed
transformation ramon threw up his hands in despair
my wife fell upon me and almost choked me with hugs
and kisses and old melik smiled and nodded as much
as to say it was all arranged

  madre de dios what can i do cried ramon if i
should consent to the mad scheme i could never get you
all back here and even if i could how could i be sure
you would not bring diseases or germs or a plague here 
por dios i wont do it ill smash every prism in ur-
quin every fragment of-

  his words were silenced by naliches lips but pres-
ently he freed himself and leaping up paced back and
forth excitedly and even if i should consent he
exclaimed what would become of the people here
they would have no priest no queen no-

  prince i supplied with a laugh for of course i
added if naliche goes you will go also

  and also will go with us the little mara choki put
in naliche

  santisima madre he cried we might just as
well transform the whole population and be done with it

  a most excellent idea i assured him provided
you have enough manabinite to accomplish the feat
and honestly ramon i believe there is no other
course despite the fact that you claim you are per-
fectly happy i believe you too would feel more content
in our old world and in your old form and--

  its a damnable risk he burst out how do i know
that some terrible tragedy may not happen  how do we
know that in the outer world all the years these people
have lived may not come over them with a rush how
would you like to see your mosock nina transformed
into a gray-haired wrinkled old woman


amazing stories

  i laughed fm not afraid of that i assured him
and i might remind you that you took far greater risks
when you first stood before the reducing prism and drew
the bow across the strings of your fiddle and you took
as great a risk when you enlarged yourself to come to me
you were not at all certain you ever could return to
naliche

  but where could these people live where could
they go what could they do he cried they
are living two three thousand years back they know
nothing of our world of its dangers its temptations
its ills theyd become drunkards vagabonds thieves
or theyd become civilized lazy dirty indians and in
a few years-even in a few months-theyd disappear
die off

  by jove i ejaculated i believe i have the an-
swer to your questions ramon do you remember i
told you of a remarkable hidden and inaccessible valley
i stumbled upon in the mountains remember i told
you that it could be reached only by a hidden way by
a narrow cleft just at the snow line and which from
even a short distance appeared to be blocked by a cata-
ract of water melted from the glaciers and the en-
trance could be held by one man against hundreds if
need be no one could leave or enter unless it was
desired and the valley itself the crater of an extinct vol-
cano is most beautiful it is warm and sunny a brawl-
ing river flows through it the soil is rich it teems with
fish and game and there are even wild llamas the de-
scendants of those that escaped from captivity ages ago
and it was at one time inhabited there are the ruins
of houses of a temple of impressive buildings and many
in such perfect condition that they could be used as
habitations today it would be i think an ideal refuge
for these people you could reign as their king with
naliche their queen they would be as completely cut
off from contact with the world as here and they you
would be far better off and just as safe if not much
safer and i can guide you to it easily its barely four
days tramp from manabi

  ramons eyes had brightened as i continued speaking
and i knew him so well and could so readily interpret
his moods that i knew he too had been won over

  por dios i had forgotten that he cried springing
forward and embracing me its the very spot and-
mil diablos amigo mio i must admit it you were right
about my longing to go back to the outer world ive
been worried to death for months fearing some such
calamity as you suggested at first i did not fully ap-
preciate our minute our incalculably small size and the
ever-present dangers that surround us it has been by
the merest chance that urquin hasnt been utterly de-
stroyed with all its people centuries ago suppose for
example some prospector some settler some confounded
archeologist should drive a stake down in this spot
valgame dios it makes me shudder to think of it or
suppose some one happened to kindle a roaring campfire
over our heads but now you remind me of that secret
valley i shall hesitate no longer just as soon as i can
build a large enough prism-or rather a series of small
ones-with the capacity to transform everyhere one at
one time ill move every soul in urquin to your blessed
valley

  i grasped his hand naliche cavorted and danced in
most unqueenly fashion mosock nina alternately
threw herself upon me and upon ramon old melik

fairly beamed and mara-choki not to be outdone
crowed lustily and kicked his heels in delight

chapter xii
the manabi village enlarged

ramons preparations for the greatest event in
the history of urquin since its inhabitants had
been accidentally reduced did not require as
much time as he or i had anticipated this was due
largely to old melik the old priest astounded us by
revealing the fact that he knew of a large mass of mana-
binite but having always regarded the stuff as evil and
as magic he had never told of it to anyone but now
that he was keen on entering an entirely new world and
a new life he lost no time in guiding us to it the mass
of crystal was-in the terms of ordinary measurements-
an infinitesimal bit of dust hundreds thousands of times
smaller than any visible dust mote but in comparison
to the other fragments we had seen in comparison to
ourselves it was enormous and ramon felt sure that it
would possess sufficient power to transform the entire
population at one time but as he wisely pointed out
there might be difficulties or even real dangers in at-
tempting such a wholesale enlarging

  the note of the quena might not be powerful enough
to actuate the huge prism and it might for all he or i
knew enlarge everyone to gigantic size

  moreover the mechanical difficulties to be met in
transforming the mass to a prism were nearly insur-
mountable but as ramon pointed out it would pro-
vide material enough for prisms for every inhabitant
each he explained would be back of his or her indi-
vidual prism and-if he were not wholly wrong in his
calculations-a single note would do the trick

  this seemed as reasonable as anything in the impos-
sible land and we at once set to work with a gang of
skilled stone-cutters in a very short time we had the
entire mass of crystal in ramons workshop then the
cutting grinding and polishing of the crystalline prisms
began and months went by before one-half of them
were completed but eventually all were ready and
ramon devoted the greatest care and many days to set-
ting up his stands and adjusting devices in the plaza
they were arranged in a circle spaced with the most ex-
act mathematical calculations precisely the same distance
apart and from a common centre where another was
placed with equal precision and exactitude ramon
placed small stone tablets on the ground each the identi-
cal distance from a prism as its neighbor and he placed
another the same distance from the central stand the
idea he explained was to insure the actuating vibra-
tory note reaching every prism at the same instant and
with exactly the same volume on each plate or slab
a man woman or child was to stand he was to stand
on the central slab and at the properly pitched note on his
quena every prism would-if his calculations were not at
fault-act simultaneously and enlarge every human be-
ing equally and at the identical instant

  the people of course had no idea of what it was all
about i imagine they regarded our preparations as
mystical rites and that some very holy and important
religious ceremony was to be held in the plaza and
when at last the great day arrived and at naliches
commands backed by those of melik the wondering
and somewhat timid inhabitants flocked to the plaza and
beyond the green prism



were arranged upon their respective stone pedestals
they felt certain they were taking part in some new and
extremely important ceremony of their religion and
as i looked at them submissive peaceful raising no
questions regarding their priest their queen and their
alien king with something akin to adoration and know-
ing nothing of what was about to take place or so at
least i hoped i could not help feeling sorry for them
it was all well enough for ramon myself mosock
nina naliche and melik we knew what we were
doing what to expect what provided all went well
would happen and we had chosen to be transformed to
another state of our own free will but these poor
folk had no idea of events to come they had no say in
the matter for of course it would have been hopeless to
have attempted an explanation and they were even if
unconsciously about to be torn from homes and all
their possessions then i noticed that every individual
carried bundles a bulky package or two wrapped in the
thin parchment-like material i had employed for my
notebook and tied with thongs what i wondered
did these packages contain my unspoken question was
answered by naliche who was now speaking

she was telling them that she her husband the
priest and the amautu wiseman with the beard
myself had decided it was best for all to go to a new
land that there was no danger and she was asking if all
were there if all were in readiness for departure
have all obeyed my instructions to have with you food
that may sustain you on the long journey  she asked

  by jove she had had more common sense than any
of us she had foreseen that the people would need
food and had given directions for all to provide them-
selves with enough provisions to last for some time but
what food had they taken if they had cereals vegetable
foodstuffs in their packs they would find nothing within
the wrappings when they had gone through the ap-
proaching transformation it would never do to over-
look this detail and breaking in upon naliches words i
voiced my fears to ramon

  dont worry he assured me naliche saw to that
all they carry is meat but haw about yourself
wheres your comida food amigo

  i-i- i stammered heartily ashamed of my own
lack of foresight i-

  it is provided announced my wife my dearly
beloved cannot remember even to eat many times so
busy is his mind with other things and so i have what
he shall need on the journey it is with mine in the
hands of manakan our serving man and yakussa
her maid

  and now melik was speaking and as i turned towards
him i grinned the old priest did not intend to go
hungry at any rate beside him stood an immense
bundle half as tall as himself and far greater in girth
than his lean body

  my children he said fear not no matter what may
happen we go upon a strange journey and the king
and the wise one of the beard with their magic and
with the help of the gods and the stones of green will
shorten our journey and strange events may come to
you but you need have no fear for think you that your
divine queen and your king of great wisdom and the
prince mara choki and my daughter mosock nina
and even i your priest of the sun would face dangers if

such they were and now prepare yourselves for all
is in readiness and fall upon your knees and give prayers
unto the gods of our fathers and chant praises unto
inti and unto wira kocha and unto our divine queen
and our king and unto the wise one of the beard for
great will be the blessings that shall be yours

  with one accord everyone knelt and in unison their
voices rose in the joyful chant of praise then in silence
they rose and though i saw awe and reverence and
wonder upon their faces nowhere was there a sign of
fear or of doubt their faith was sublime and they
would follow blindly without thought of question
wherever their adored queen and their revered priest
might lead

  then i saw ramon place his bone quena to his lips
as expectantly all waited for the unknown events that
were to follow a few soft low tones came from the
instrument and then a quavering wailing note that
seemed to tear at ones very heart strings higher and
higher it rose and i realized that it must have some
strange hypnotic quality for i felt suddenly drowsy
despite my efforts to observe what took place my eyes
closed and i felt that delightful but indescribable sen-
sation that we have when on the borderland of slumber
then with the same abrupt jerk with which one awakens
from such a semi-conscious state i came to my senses
and opened my eyes

  i glanced about and an ejaculation of surprise and dis-
appointment escaped me what had gone wrong  had
the prisms failed us there still gazing with awed
wondering faces were the people there stood ra-
mon quena in hand there was naliche with the little
prince in her arms mosock ninas hand rested in mine
and-i gasped utterly unable to believe my senses the
great temple the palace every building had vanished
the stones on which we had stood had disappeared on
every side stretched barren sand broken only by clumps
of stunted trees and giant cacti was it possible

had- ramons voice broke the silence well

amigo here we are he cried gaily easy as possible
not even a jolt or a jar on that trip and-por dios
what do you see you look as if you saw a ghost he
turned in the direction in which i was staring as if as he
truly said i saw a ghost and little wonder for as i
had glanced at melik i had seen beside him not the
bundle i had noticed in urquin but the dried mummi-
fied body of wira kocha

  ramon chuckled madre de dios he exclaimed
hes brought along the ancestral god well its not a
bad idea these people will feel far safer and more
content with him to watch over them im surprised old
melik thought of it but hes a wise old-

  a joyful yelping interrupted his words and into the
circle trotted the burro with the dog leaping playfully
about him we had completely forgotten them but they
must have been within range of the manabinites activity
for here they were still with us then my eyes caught
sight of something else sniffing about the sand as if
searching for food in this unfamiliar land were two of
the strange eight-legged hard-shelled creatures that had
been domesticated by the urquins and as if the pres-
ence of the four familiar beasts broke the spell that was
upon them the people burst into joyous shouts and
everyone began to laugh talk and chatter at once

  santisima madre but its hard to believe weve ever
been away from here cried ramon look amigo


amazing stories

theres your camp-nothings changed i wonder if your
men are still here if they are and they see this crowd
theyll take to their heels or drop dead with terror
i-

  no chance of that i replied theyve undoubtedly
left long ago you forget ive been away for months
but we might as well stop here and use the camp tonight
its too late to start off for your secret valley now
we can start first thing in the morning and theres no
chance of being intruded upon here

  fine come ahead cried ramon joyously and with
mosock ninas hand clasped in mine accompanied by
ramon naliche and old melik who was followed by two
temple attendants carefully carrying wiras mummy we
led our little host across the stretch of desert towards my
former camp as i had expected it was deserted i did
not learn until much later that the men had abandoned
it a few days after i had disappeared with ramon
but i suspected as much when i found that the camp
contained a large portion of my outfit and a quantity of
provisions that the scallawags had left anything of
value was due entirely to their inability to carry any
more in their canoes but the food was most acceptable
and the tools the supplies the innumerable utensils and
articles with which i had equipped myself for the ex-
pedition and for a stay of unknown duration at the spot
would all be invaluable to ramon and his people in their
new home and he was overjoyed to find that the corn
the beans the potatoes and camotes sweet potatoes
were all untouched by mice or weevils and would serve
as the nucleus for bounteous crops and harvests in the
hidden valley and i had to laugh at his delighted ex-
clamation when in cleaning out the place he found that
the straw used by the men for their beds had heads of
wheat and barley in the litter and that there were grains
of the cereals still in them in fact the rubbish proved
a veritable treasure-trove and for once i was thankful
for the untidy not to say filthy habits of the natives
there were orange and lemon seeds scattered on the
floor we picked up a number of durazno peach pits
remains of pineapples cast carelessly outside had taken
root and several palta alligator or avocado pear seeds
had sprouted there were a few peanuts also and
there was a bag of cocoa beans and a small sack of
coffee beans

  gracias a dios exclaimed ramon we can now
raise everything we need in the valley all we lack is
sugar and cotton

  dont worry over those i said whoever lived in
the valley before left plenty of cotton-there are acres
of it and as for sugar look here i led him to one
side of the camp and pointed to a clump of scraggly
cane thank sam for that i said like all west
indians he was forever chewing sugar-cane and just as
an experiment he planted some here its pretty poor
stuff but in good soil it will be as fine as you can wish
now lets get settled down for the night by jove
look at the people ramon whats the matter with
them theyre frightened half to death

  ever since we had arrived the people had been timid
herding close together gazing about at every object for
of course every object was new and strange to their
eyes and even melik naliche and my wife kept close
to our sides awed and half-frightened amid their strange
surroundings

  but now abject terror had seized the people they had

clustered together in a dense throng they were fairly
quaking with dread and strange sobbing sigh-like wails
arose from them

  all were gazing with abject fear into the east as if
they had seen some horrible apparition

  then as ramon and i followed their terrified gaze
we burst into peals of laughter

  they were looking at the moon

  but to them it was no laughing matter even melik
was frightened half to death and little wonder al-
though there had been night and day in urquin light and
darkness yet never had the urquins viewed either the
sun or the moon to them the sun was merely light
and was visualized only in the image of the sun-god a
symbol handed down from the times when their an-
cestors had been full-sized men and women yet now
here in this new strange land they saw this great round
luminous thing rising like a ball of light in the sky to
their eyes it seemed the metal sun-disc of their temple
come suddenly to life for seen through the haze above
the mountains it was golden in color and the dim
shadows of mountains upon its surface were not unlike
the features graven upon the gold sun in the urquin
temple and to see the sun-god suddenly appear to
them as a moving apparently living thing was as ter-
rifying as awe-inspiring to them as the sudden reincar-
nation of our god would be to us

  it was with the utmost difficulty that we calmed their
fears and we never would have succeeded if it had not
been for melik who being a most sensible chap even if
he was my father-in-law quickly grasped the situation
and with his accustomed ability to take full advantage
of the psychological moment saw in the rising moon an
opportunity not to be missed

  behold he cried in his deep ringing voice as he
raised his gaunt arms and all eyes turned towards him
behold my children the goddess mama-quilla wife
of our lord inti the sun she comes to smile upon you
her people and to do homage to our sacred wira kocha
whose spirit ever guards thee and whose body is here
beside me fall upon your knees o my children and
give prayers to mama-quilla that throughout this night
and the nights to come she may ever smile benignly upon
thee while her lord the sun is at rest and pray unto her
to carry thy prayers and thy salutations to her lord
that he may smile brightly upon you on the morrow and
on each day until the end of time

  ramon who had dropped to his knees beside me with
the others nudged me por dios im afraid your re-
spected father-in-law is fixing for a cropper he
whispered with a grin i wonder how hell square him-
self when the moon wanes and doesnt show up some
night

  thats his lookout i whispered in reply as i
squeezed my wifes hand reassuringly but you neednt
worry over him youd have to get up mighty early to
get ahead of him ramon in fact youd have to stay up
all night hes nobodys fool by a long shot and instead
of taking the cropper you foresee hell turn it all to his
own account-or rather to the glory of old wira kocha
and his faith

  ramon chuckled id give a lot to know what wira
himself thinks about it he murmured look at him
he may be only a mummy but por dios amigo mio
i could swear he winked when he caught my eye

chapter xiii
finale

there is not much more to relate and as i sit
here writing these lines with my adorable mosock
nina beside me-though in her conventional
clothes she is not to my eyes as beautiful as in her scin-
tillating robes of insect-wings i find it hard to believe
that all the events i have written down actually occurred
despite my strange notebook-which by the way con-
tains only blank pages for of course the writing being
in vegetable ink was not enlarged despite mosock nina
despite our urquin costumes carefully packed away
and despite my vivid memories and my wifes confirma-
tion of the details i feel at times as if it were all a
dream

  it seems incredible that i that my wife that ramon
should have been invisible microscopic beings in an
equally microscopic land and it seems almost as in-
credible that ramon naliche melik mara-choki and all
the others-even the mummy of that unknown ancient
semite wira kocha are in the hidden secret valley in
the ecuadorean andes and yet i know it to be so and
i know-unless some unforeseen casualty prevents-
that within the next thirty days my wife and i will be
again among her people that i shall again be clasping
the hand of ramon that i shall again greet queen
naliche and old melik the priest and that i shall again
look upon the mute bearded body of wira-kocha seated
in his niche in the restored temple in the hidden valley
now green with the tilled fields of maize wheat cotton
and cane of the happy gentle urquins whether we
shall remain there and settle down to spend our lives
among the adopted people of ramon i am not sure
but even should we decide to return to our so-called
civilization-which i doubt for i am becoming heartily
sick of it all-we can always return to visit naliche ra-
mon and the others whenever we wish

  but i am digressing early on the morning following
our strange transformation we started on the long
journey to the secret valley no human eye saw that
strange procession as it wound across the desert towards
the distant hills for in all that land no human being
dwelt the first part of the way was hard for it led
across the desert but the worst of it was over before
the sun rose high then to rest the people and out of
consideration for the women and children we halted in
a grove of trees during the hottest portion of the day
and resumed the journey in the afternoon of course
though i forgot to mention the fact the rising sun caused
almost as much terror and even more awe than had the
moon the night before but in a way the people had been
prepared for the appearance of the blazing deity and
were expecting it and of course everything they saw
filled them with wonder they had literally entered a
new world and it speaks volumes for their courage and
for their entire faith in their rulers and their priest
that they did not become paralyzed or stampede with
abject fear of the unknown and of the strange objects
conditions and surroundings

  as we ascended the andean ranges we were forced to
proceed very slowly and i as well as ramon began to
fear that the altitudes would play havoc with the people
and that after all we might be forced to abandon our
well-laid plans

but in this we were mistaken the urquins showed
no serious effects even at heights that would affect many

men accustomed to mountains and in due time we ap-
proached the glistening snow-caps of the peak wherein
the valley lay it was well that naliche had foreseen
the need of food and it was still more fortunate that the
supplies had been augmented by what we found in my
camp for long before we reached the narrow black cleft
that was the entrance to the valley we were all on short
rations but we did not worry i knew that we would
find game within the valley-fish and probably some
edible vegetables that had run wild since the place had
last been inhabited in this i was not mistaken and
ramon when he looked upon the great fair valley was
enthusiastic in praise while naliches eyes sparkled
she fairly danced and all vowed that they had never
dreamed there could be a scene so beautiful beside the
river we made our temporary homes using the ruins of
the ancient inhabitants for shelter and in the vicinity we
found an abundance of half-wild maize of camotes peas
beans and other food the dog chased and captured a
large marmot several of the men-accustomed to hunting
the giant insects of their former home-secured a deer
and all dined well meanwhile melik in whose mind
religion took precedence over food had cleaned out the
ruined temple had installed wiras mummy within it
and as the sun set he summoned all to render their de-
votions and to give thanks to the gods for the blessings
they had received

  i was truly amazed to see how quickly the people
adapted themselves to their new environment within
a few days they were taking everything as a matter of
course they found no difficulty in cultivating the new
crops as well as they had those in urquin they fashion-
ed weapons and hunted the beasts and birds so strange to
them they repaired and occupied the prehistoric dwell-
ings and transformed the ruined palace into a royal
home for ramon and naliche and they worked like
beavers from dawn until dark

  even to ramon who was not yet convinced that they
were better off it was obvious that under the new state
of affairs and in the pure mountain air the people were
livelier stronger than before and he was vastly relieved
to find that the youth of the aged and the-well some-
what advanced-years of naliche and of mosock nina
was not altered by their change in life and environment
in fact in a short time he was as enthusiastic over the
transference as wras everyone else but he expressed a
fear that somehow sometime the valley might be dis-
covered and invaded theres always the chance of an
airplane seeing us he declared then how could we
remain free from all the damned troubles and ills of the
rest of the world 

  theres no fear of that i assured him in the
first place no plane is coming this way if the pilot can
avoid it its far too dangerous flying among these high
peaks an aviator would have to reach an altitude of
more than twenty thousand feet to cross the surrounding
summits and at that height he couldnt distinguish the
details of the valley and even if by some miracle he
should see houses and fields here hed assume they were
ruins and deserted fields of ancient long-dead inhabitants
no ramon you and your people are as safe here as on
another planet rest assured of that

i remained with him and his people for several months
until i had seen them well started and established but
my wife was as anxious to see the marvels of the rest of

by alfred pringle

i let the receiver fall
back on its hook with a
bang and turned in my
chair among our list
of inventors jim i said
to my partner across the room
do we have a mr james t
miller 

  jim looked up from the pile
of papers over which he had
been working and stared
thoughtfully for a moment at
the ceiling

  idont remember anyone by
that name whats his racket 
he claims to be an inventor
of deadly weapons that was
he on the phone just now hes
coming to show us an invention
which he wishes to offer to the
united states government and
being a kind hearted soul hes
going to let us handle matters
for him ive made the ap-
pointment for two oclock
which means weve just

      projectile discharged at high
 velocity begins at once to lose its
 rate of motion it does not seem to
 us a thing of impossibility that
 some day someone will find the
 secret whereby some of the radiant
 or wave forces of nature might be
 used to do this thing as a substitute
 for powder to carry destruction
 with itself at uniform velocity to
 any distance the denouement of
 this vivid story occurs in a star-
 tling manner in the inventors
 laboratory in death valley

 illustrated by
 mckay

                           got

thirty-five minutes to wait

  jim laughed another nut i suppose he could have
won the world war if hed been given a chance what
else did he say

  well he claims this invention will revolutionize mod-
ern warfare that was about all

  thats enough if he can do that jim remarked and
went back to his papers

  it was five years now since i had taken jim parsons
into my office as junior partner during those years our
business had grown to such an extent that ours was now
one of the best known of the patent attorney offices in
the city i had been somewhat skeptical when i first
accepted jim for he scarcely had been out of law school
a year and was considered rather wild he possessed
however a certain shrewdness which from the first
marked him as one who would be successful in the law
in fact i soon turned the entire legal end of the business
over to jim for i found him capable of handling it

  i was puzzled about this man miller he had talked

                       very earnestly over the phone
and had even gone so far as to
offer to pay us for our time if
we were not interested freak
inventors are not usually willing
to back up their ideas with
money

  at about five minutes before
the time of our appointment i
happened to glance in the direc-
tion of the office door a
shadow passed across the
frosted pane and then in a mo-
ment repassed i stepped
quickly to the door and swung
it open

  a stranger was pacing the
corridor his hands clasped be-
hind his back and a far-off ex-
pression in his eyes he stopped
when he saw me	

                       are you mr harding he
               asked

i nodded

i am mr miller the man
who phoned you a half hour
ago i got here a few minutes
before the time you set so i spent it in my pacings i
work out quite a few of my ideas in this way he
smiled rather foolishly i thought

  i perceive he went on that you saw me through
your office door i suppose you have the light in the
corridor arranged for this purpose

  i did not reply it was beginning to appear as if jim
was right if this man was not crazy he certainly was
most eccentric however we could hardly turn him
away without an interview i decided we had best hear
what he had to say and then get rid of him in the easiest
way possible

  it is now two oclock mr miller i remarked
patronizingly if you are ready we should like to hear
about your invention

  you will not only hear about it you will also witness
a very convincing demonstration he said as he picked
up a large package which had been lying beside the door
and entered the office

 


amazing stories

  i followed and introduced him to jim we drew up
chairs and miller placed the package on the floor beside
him as we sat down in the better light of the office i
had a chance to examine him more closely he was a
large man of perhaps fifty clean shaven and dressed in
a gray business suit his skin was very dark and but
for his excellent english i would have taken him for
a foreigner

  you are quite sure we shall not be overheard in
here he asked glancing suspiciously around

  this is saturday afternoon and the office force are all
gone i assured him we are alone in this part of the
building

  my statement seemed to satisfy him

  i have often thought he began as he leaned back
in his chair that the present method employed in pro-
jecting a missile is neither the most effective nor the
cheapest means available in throwing a projectile with
gunpowder there are several elements which act upon it
to lessen its effectiveness-air resistance and the pull of
gravity for instance there are however certain nat-
ural forces available to mankind which never have been
used until i centered my attention upon them elec-
tricity of course has been experimented with but with-
out much success to throw a bolt of electricity with
sufficient power to destroy was a far more expensive
means than the use of gunpowder i next turned my
attention to other sources light was not solid enough
it had the speed behind it but it lacked the consistence
this i also discarded

  my next experiment was with sound it proved to
be the very thing i was looking for sound does not
have the speed of light but there is a certain force be-
hind it

  miller paused to light a cigar i looked at jim he
was grinning good-naturedly and as he caught my
glance he winked by this time i was quite convinced
that the inventor was crazy still we had to give him a
chance to tell us about it

  perhaps you have noticed miller continued that
when a low note is sounded on a pipe organ it creates a
vibration in objects close at hand i worked from this
fact now sound travels at the rate of one thousand
eighty-seven feet a second a speed about one-half or
even one-third that of a bullet this speed however does
not lessen with distance as does that of the projectile

  now then as the pitch of a tone becomes lower the
vibrations per second lessen therefore as the range is
limited in that direction i had to work to the other ex-
treme my first task then was to invent a sound pro-
ducer the note of which would have an enormous num-
ber of vibrations i have succeeded in constructing such
a machine its frequency is so high that it is far above
the range of the human ear this supplied the necessary
force to my sound projectile next came the most diffi-
cult task of all-the construction of suitable reflectors
perhaps you have noticed that when a stone is tossed
into a pool the ripples thus caused grow fainter and
fainter as they spread away from the center sound acts
in very much the same way to overcome this loss by
spreading i built reflectors which would cause the sound
to travel only in one straight line or beam i can vary
the width of this line at will you no doubt see the
possibilities of such an invention i can destroy a path
either as wide or as far as i wish

  to control the range i have built a deflector which
causes the waves to spend themselves one against an-
other at any point i set

he paused and smiled the grin had faded from
jims face and in its place there was a look of ap-
prehension the thing had certainly taken a serious
aspect i had no doubt that the man was mad but there
was a great deal of logic in what he had said i hated to
think what might happen if such a power as he described
were used for some maniacal purpose

  i believe miller went on that i have given you a
fairly clear idea of what lies behind my visit here now
let me give you a practical demonstration

  we gazed silently as he placed the package on a desk
and removed the wrapper the machine he disclosed to
our view was as strange a thing as i had ever seen
there was a horn shaped very much like a megaphone
but squared off at the open end directly behind this
was placed a piece of twisted tubing which resembled
a snail shell a steel box had been set into the center of
the tubing and the whole machine with the exception of
the horn was enclosed in a glass case a small shaft ran
out of the steel box through the glass and was connected
to an electric motor a control panel was located in the
very rear of the machine with an electric cord the in-
ventor connected the motor to a light socket and then
busied himself at the control panel

  he worked silently paying no attention to us jim
leaned intently forward in his chair watching the mans
face presently miller straightened up walked over to
the wall and pressed the light button the motor began
to whir softly then he took from his pocket an oblong
piece of metal and held it in the palm of his hand for our
inspection

  this he explained is a piece of manganese steel
it is one of the toughest metals known to modern sci-
ence there are no tools made which can cut it it
must be ground

  you shall see what happens to it

  he placed the piece of steel on another table directly
in front of the horn shaped muzzle of his weapon then
he walked around behind his machine and again glanced
over his controls

  now he cried and pressed a small lever at the side
of the panel

  i glanced sharply at him as he uttered that cry a
peculiar light burned in his eyes-like the light of a
maniac it faded at once

  jim stared fascinated at the piece of steel slowly
before our eyes it crumbled until it lay a disintegrated
mass upon the table

  mr miller raised the lever and crossing the room
switched off the current his demonstration had been
completed

  he took his seat i hope gentlemen he smiled that
i have been able to convince you that there is something
practical behind my invention now here is a proposi-
tion i would like to make to you in an isolated spot in
death valley i have erected a laboratory so far as i
am aware i am the only one who knows of its where-
abouts there i have constructed a machine quite sim-
ilar to this model but of far greater proportions with
it i assure you i can destroy the city of los angeles
so great is its power before we go further into this
matter i should like to take you out there for a more
thorough examination of my invention if you are
agreeable i shall call for you here at this building to-
morrow morning at eight

  i glanced inquiringly at jim for a moment he was
thoughtful then he nodded his assent

  tomorrow at eight then i agreed
into the valley of death



  without another word to us mr miller wrapped up
his model tucked it under his arm and left the office

  as soon as he had gone i went to the table on which
lay the little pile of steel dust the fine powder sifted
through my fingers as i picked it up the surface of
the table was scorched as if fire had touched it

  well i inquired turning to jim what do you
think of him

  hes crazy all right jim nodded slowly but if he
has such an invention as he describes it is not a safe
thing to leave in his hands whats the matter with
turning the whole thing over to the police

  several things i assured him in the first place
if they arrest mr miller i doubt if they could ever make
him disclose the location of his secret laboratory to
find that place in the innumerable canons and quicksand
traps of death valley would be next to impossible no
i think our best plan is to accompany him and then fig-
ure out the right thing to do when we get there

the next morning as i approached the office build-
ing i saw that jim was there ahead of me he
grinned cheerfully enough as i came up but i judged
by his heavy-lidded eyes that he had slept little better
than i had

  did you rest well last night  he asked

  fairly well i said but ive seen this city lying in
ruins a dozen times in my dreams

  it was about the same with me he admitted this
thing is getting on my nerves

  i set my bag down alongside of his for we had come
prepared to stay three or four days

  you didnt forget anything jim tapped the bulge
on his hip significantly for answer i slipped my auto-
matic out of my pocket far enough for him to see it

  promptly at eight oclock a touring car drew up to
the curb miller sat in the tonneau and a japanese
chauffeur was behind the wheel as we got in i noticed
that there were provisions lying on the seat beside the
driver

  the inventor was not in as talkative a mood as he had
been the day before he greeted us briefly til tell
you my plans he said as we moved off i intend to
stop at some desert town tonight then well get an
early start tomorrow morning and reach the valley be-
fore it gets hot

  after this bit of information he lapsed into a silence
from which neither jim nor i could lure him

it was very early the following morning when we
made our approach to death valley we had trav-
eled all the previous day without incident and had
stopped for the night as mr miller had planned at a
desert town we were again on our way the next morn-
ing before the first streak of dawn had shown itself over
the ridge of the distant mountains

  as daylight came the mountains around us loomed up
more distinctly far to the east the steely blue funeral
range stretched out before us on the west and much
nearer at hand lay the panamints their sides splashed
with reddish tints

  as we moved along i stole a glance ait miller his
eyes were shining as he peered at the scenes around us
i knew he loved this valley of death he waved a hand
in a northeasterly direction

  off there he explained lies the armogossa bog
it is formed by the armogossa river which loses itself

in the sandsof this valley that is where so many men in
the earlier days were sucked down in its treacherous
quicksands when they sought a short cut across the
valley he chuckled softly as if the thought were pleas-
ant to him

  those white splotches you see he went on are
borax deposits the valley is very rich in them

  then almost abruptly the scenes changed the road
we had been traveling had carried us quite close to the
foothills of the panamint mountains and now as the
chauffeur swung his car off the road we traveled straight
into them

  the walls of the canon up which we drove rose higher
and higher mr miller beamed as the picture before us
unfolded i believe i never before saw the variety of
colors displayed in those rocky walls

  at a point about a mile from the main road the jap
suddenly turned his car and entered a narrow gap in the
opposite wall of the canon this gap in turn widened
out into an arroyo which we followed for another mile

  end of the line miller smiled as the car stopped
we proceed the rest of the way on foot

  he packed the provisions into a knapsack swung it
over his shoulder and started up the side of the arroyo

  jim and i followed with our bags the jap remained
with the car

  it was hard work to keep up with the figure ahead of
us the going was steep and slippery with our free
hands we grasped at jutting rocks and bushes to help us
along presently we reached the top where we paused
for breath i looked back over the trail we had come
in the distance i saw the car making its way down the
arroyo on its return trip

  that jap is a good man miller commented we
have made this trip a hundred times and never once has
he attempted to follow me

  when we regained our breath we moved on pursuing
a faint trail which ran along the rim of the arroyo for a
short distance then abruptly it swung off across coun-
try and there followed a series of tortuous climbings and
descents the sun by this time had risen high and the
heat was almost unbearable we moved along in silence
then suddenly as we topped a small hill there lay before
us what can best be described as a huge hole in the earth
at one time it must have been the crater of a tremendous
volcano at any rate there it lay before us the sun
glinting from the colored rock on the opposite side it
was perhaps three miles wide and five long the sides
wtere perpendicular except at the point where we stood
and the floor was strewn with great boulders we
scrambled and slid to the bottom of the crater

  then i saw the laboratory it stood about two hun-
dred feet from us a roughly-built structure a single
story high so cleverly was it sheltered by the overhang-
ing cliffs that it had not been visible to us from the top

  as we approached the building i turned to miller
how i asked did you ever manage to construct this
building in here

  he smiled and shrugged it was an absolute neces-
sity that i should have some place isolated from the
rest of the world where i could carry on my experi-
ments with this invention i found this spot and decided
to use it i made trip after trip here bringing in ma-
terials and supplies

  when we reached the house he unlocked the door and
stepped aside for us to enter we deposited our bags


amazing stories

within and he stored his provisions in a cupboard

  there was only one room in the place a wide bench
had been built along one wall and this was strewn with as
complete an assortment of laboratory equipment as i
have ever seen a generator driven by a gasoline engine
stood in one corner a few chairs a table and a cot
completed the furnishings

  jim was gazing curi-
ously around wheres
the machine  he asked
miller

  the inventor pointed
through a window to a
small outbuilding in
there he said  after
we have had a bite to eat
well visit it and make a
few experiments

it was not yet noon but
we ate ravenously of
the meal miller prepared
for us when the table
was again cleared he went
to the generator in the
corner and examined it
carefully then he started
the gasoline motor the
generator whined above
the put-put of the engine

miller turned to us

  if you are ready he
said we will go and try
out the machine

  leading the way out of
the house he locked the
door behind us an un-
necessary precaution i
thought

  as we approached the
outbuilding i saw that its
large swinging door
opened out upon the rocky
floor of the crater

  i was not particularly
surprised at the machine
he disclosed to us when he
opened the door it was
quite similar to the model
he had shown us in our
office except that it was
constructed on a much larger scale there was the same
peculiarly shaped barrel but the glass case which had
enclosed the rear part of the model was represented by
a great steel box inside we could hear the whir of a
motor as it was driven by the generator in the house
the inventor went to the control panel and set his dials
then i saw a crafty look come into his eyes

  there is a slight adjustment to be made on the gen-
erator he explained til be back in a minute

  he went to the house and let himself in i nodded
significantly to jim without a word he moved quietly
to one of the windows and peered in in a moment he
returned

  he got something from the corner where the gen-
erator is jim whispered but he made no adjustment

  i was troubled it was apparent that miller had some

other scheme besides showing us his invention what
it was i had no idea but i felt reassuringly of the auto-
matic in my pocket

  millers peculiar actions had not affected jim as they
had me he was enjoying himself moving about the
machine and examining it

  when miller reappeared he did nothing which war-
ranted my suspicions go-
ing to his giant weapon he
again set the dials and
then pointed to a huge
boulder about half way
across the crater he
calmly pressed the lever
with absolutely no noise
the great stone flew into
thousands of pieces mil-
ler laughed shrilly

   how do you like it  he
asked as he swung the
machine around for an-
other aim and again
pressed the lever an-
other boulder flew to
pieces

  watch this one he
said and directed and ele-
vated the muzzle of his
machine

  far across the valley
towered a tall precipice
as we watched it a section
fully two hundred feet in
width quivered for a mo-
ment lunged forward and
then plunged to the floor
of the canon with a tre-
mendous crash

  we stood there awed
by the irresistible power
the machine possessed
miller was calmly walking
forward to examine the
destruction he had
wrought mute with as-
tonishment we followed
close behind him

  youll notice he re-
marked stooping and
picking up a small piece
of rock how the sound
vibrations absolutely pulverize anything that comes
within their reach he pinched the piece and it fell
to dust

  now let us consider the other side he went on
the constructive possibilities in such a device

  it could be used in all sorts of mining and other wrork
where great forces are needed but i have decided to
use it as a destructive measure only he chuckled
malignantly

  surely i said in astonishment at what i had seen
there is something which will combat such a power

  my ejaculation had been an involuntary one but if i
had suddenly touched off a cannon the effect would not
have been more startling

  miller wheeled like a panther more speedily than i
thought possible for a man of his size from under his

miller wheeled like a panther  from under his
coat he jerked out as strange a weapoyi as the one
he had just demonstrated and pointed the thing
at us
into the valley of death



coat he jerked out as strange a weapon as the one he had
just demonstrated and pointed the thing at us in his
eyes there was a look of insane rage

  when he wheeled jim had reached for his automatic
but too late miller had us covered so you found
out he cackled you found out about this other
weapon but youre too late ill see to that

  it was plain to me that i had snapped the string which
had held the mans reason in check and he was now a
raving maniac

  we had no idea as to the power of the weapon with
which he was covering us but we could easily guess
from his other demonstrations one barrel was bell-
shaped and made of some white substance directly back
of the barrel there was a ball of metal three inches in
diameter from which protruded a trigger a pistol grip
completed the weapon

millers wild laughter continued for several min-
utes then it stopped abruptly and a rather silly
expression crossed his face you two are fools he
leered why should i sell to the united states govern-
ment a machine with which i might capture a nation
havent you thought of that why should i sell for a
few dollars the thing which required a lifetime to plan

  while he spoke the weapon in his hand wavered from
jim to me and back again i stole a glance at my part-
ner he was watching the crazed inventor like a hwk
only waiting i knew for a chance to use his own gun

  before i kill you miller went on i shall demon-
strate to you the power of my little machine you shall
witness a sight such as you have never seen before and
probably here he grinned never shall again you
shall see one great force expend itself upon another it
is a terrible thing

  now if you will precede me he waved us towards
the large machine and followed close behind

  from his pocket he took a ball of twine and fastened
the end of it to the lever which discharged the sound
projectile then he unwound the twine for a distance
of a hundred yards in front of the weapon i had a
premonition of what was coming and it sent a shiver
down my spine jim was watching miller closely

  you had best stand a little way off the inventor
suggested as he pulled in the slack of his string we
moved hastily then miller swung the weapon in his
hand from us and pointed it directly at the large ma-
chine i saw the string become taut at that instant
jim went for his gun but again he was too late there
was a deafening explosion and i felt myself sinking into
the blackness of oblivion the next thing i knew jim
was bending over me wiping the dust from my face in
a moment i was able to sit up and it was then i re-
ceived the biggest surprise of my life we were alone
in the crater miller was gone the large machine and
the laboratory which had stood behind it had also dis-
appeared i turned dazedly to jim

  where are they  i asked

  he seated himself on a stone and lit a cigarette before
answering i dont know he said slowly as he flipped
the match away but i have my suspicions i was
knocked cold by that explosion just as you were but i
didnt stay out so long when i came back to conscious-
ness i was dumfounded but this is the way ive fig-
ured things out miller pulled that string and set off the
big machine at the same instant he pressed the trigger
on the little one those two engines of destruction sim-
ply annihilated each other the little weapon blew the
house and big machine off the map and the big one re-
moved miller why those cliffs back of the house didnt
come down on us i cant understand im fairly certain
something went wrong with millers plan and were the
ones who ought to be tickled pink about it

  if youre able to walk wed better get started back
toward civilization

  i got to my feet and found i was not hurt as badly as
i had imagined

  we must notify the authorities as soon as possible
i remarked

  jim smiled if you do youll be laughed out of town
just try and convince anyone that what weve seen today
really happened bring them out to this spot and show
them this hole in the ground then try to explain
youll probably end up in the psychopathic ward of some

  i was bewildered then in heavens name what shall
we do  i cried

  first of all jim said well see if we can get out
of this place alive if we manage that well keep as
silent as a couple of clams

  but the jap chauffeur i suggested

  hell come back here all right but you dont know
orientals as i do hell take a look around here and
then not being able to find anyone hell go on his way
one first class automobile to the good

  its o k with me i agreed lets get going

  as we passed the spot where the house had stood i
stooped to pick up a couple of chips when i pinched
them they crumbled just as the stone had done

  how we ever managed to get out of that place i do
not know however we finally reached the main road
hardly able to speak for want of water and our eyes
half blinded by the terrible glare of the sun a passing
car picked us up and took us into balarat the driver
looked somewhat askance at us but said nothing the
next day we were able to go on to the city

it has been two years now since we made our trip into
death valley at times i catch myself wondering if
the whole experience was not the product of some bad
dream but the occasional talks jim and i have about it
assure me of its reality for a time after we returned
to the city we advertised for relatives of mr miller but
none appeared neither have we heard anything of the
jap chauffeur he as jim had put it probably went on
his way rejoicing one automobile to the good

the world as she had been in urquin and i felt that i
must get back to civilization in order to publish the re-
sults of my discoveries and to set at rest all rumors that
unquestionably had been spread regarding my disappear-
ance moreover i had many business matters to attend
to and i must admit i was most anxious to let mosock
nina see civilization and i was even more anxious to let
civilization have the pleasure of seeing her

  so at last we bade farewell to the valley and to our
beloved freinds and by easy stages made our way to a
little interior town during our stay in the valley the
people had taken to weaving cotton and we both were
attired in cotton garments so that our appearance aroused
no comment but my wife was filled with wonder at
the strange people the houses the clothes worn and she
was thunderstruck at the first railway train she saw
still she had heard from me of all these things and
hence did not regard them either as supernatural or
dangerous and with the quick adaptability of her race

the

she soon accepted everything as a matter of course in
due time we reached quito where i secured funds from
friends for i forgot to mention that my abandoning
peons had helped themselves to all the money and valu-
ables i had had and having purchased suitable clothes
and other necessities we made our way to new york

   a narrative far more lengthy than this could be written
of my urquin wifes experiences surprise wonder and
impressions of our teeming city and its denizens but
that has no place in this tale and now i must close and
accompany my wife who is waiting for me to take her to
the top of the woolworth tower i believe it is the
only thing she has not yet done and she insists upon
gazing across manhattan from that lofty perch before we
embark on the ship that sails for guayaquil tomorrow
and which will carry us on our way towards that distant
secret valley wherein are naliche ramon melik and all
the others--yes even the burro the dog and benignly-

directly or indirectly related to the stories appearing in this magazine in case a special personal answer is required t nominal

are there other inhabited
worlds than our earth

editor amazing stories

  i have read many interplanetary travel stories
and enjoy them that authors now inject science
but makes them the more plausible and interesting
i am the last to pick flaws in their methods let
the author write his own story primarily we read
fiction because it entertains or interests us if
we do not like a story we need not read it per-
sonally i like the so-called different stories

  history shows that in the past many a wild
tale has been a prophetic one tales have been
written of flying air boats submarine travels
projected pictures voices invisible rays in the
days of practical witch-craft these are now
accepted as a matter of course who knows what
germ of future truth lies in the scientific stories
of today an unrecognized prophecy

  however if the scientists and astronomists are
correct interplanetary travel may never be accom-
plished by the physical body or mechanical inven-
tions they tell us that beyond the shell surround-
ing earth vast space is computable in light years
is a seething mass of stardust atoms fragments of
wnrlds suns stars exploding and burning
worlds it might be likened to a vast flowing ocean
of fluid lava in which spin the planetary bodies
and fragments forming new worlds perhaps as
even ours may have been formed and also de-
stroying old worlds before telescopes came earth
people believed only the sun moon and visible
stars existed but as stronger lenses developed it
was to learn that beyond these were millions more
greater than our familiar heavenly bodies and be-
rond these still more millions and on and on ad
infinitum

  they tell us if it were not for this shell sur-
rounding earth our planet would be instantly de-
stroyed by the rain of bodies stars comets travel-
ing at lightning speed to earths attraction at
times the shell is pentrated so scientists now ex-
plain the meteors and the rain of stars which
fell many years ago

if distance and motive power could be over-

come once leaving the protecting shell the vehicle
would be completely demolished

  it is interesting to speculate on the possibilities
of messages through the medium of rays or waves
will it ever be accomplished at present these
two agencies are limited to machinery at both ends
but we are only barely acquainted

  with them as yet new invisible rays and waves
have been discovered but seemingly we are as yet
in the dark as to what use may be made of them
too much effort is being spent on discovering or
rather uncovering destructive rays death-dealing
rays for use in wars that would be better expended
in developing constructive rays

  knowing as we do that all these greater-than
earth worlds with their own surrounding planetary
systems exist is it not somewhat absurd for man
to imagine that his is the only inhabited world
meteors under microscopic examination have proved
to consist of exactly the same elements as earth is
composed of is that not significant

  another unsolved riddle is does thought travel on
waves what is mental telepathy is it accom-
plished because thought can or does travel on
waves or rays few today would attempt to deny
mental telepathy but no one really explains it is
it another unknown wave waiting in the dark for
science to uncover a means of more perfect com-
munication a path-finder perhaps to other worlds
who can tell

  we would suggest to all interested in the sub-
jects of other worlds and of the constitution of the
universe to read professor jeans monumental work
on the universe there are two things which will
impress the reader one is the great emptiness of
the universe the other the probable paucity of in-
habitable worlds we may assume creatures who
could live in the heat of mercury or the ultra-icy
cold of neptune but this is mere imagination the
vast majority of the stars are hot many intensely
so-few can be considered habitable by creatures
such as our mother earth supports telepathy so
far is unproved-coincidence may have given ap-
parent effects of it-editor

mental telepathy and thought
transference

editor amazing stories

  i am greatly interested in the progress and de-
velopment of the human race

  i have been an ardent and interested reader of
amazing stories since its first appearance on the
fiction market inasmuch as i find much to please
me in its pages

  it is my firm belief that the human race as a
whole can go a long way yet in the scale of evolu-
tion both physically and mentally

  it seems to me that you are a trifle too skeptical
in your views of mental telepathy and thought
transference

  i have many times had the peculiar experience
of knowing just what a person was going to tell me
before he or she expressed his or her thoughts
vocally and furthermore without any clue to the
persons thoughts obtained from previous or fore
going conversation

  allow me to cite a little example of my meaning
while making a long business trip some few weeks
ago i struck up a speaking acquaintance as travel-
ers do with a young man from los angeles we
discussed many topics to vary the monotony of our
trip and were amusing ourselves by guessing the
ages of the various passengers on the bus when
suddenly i found myself asking my young ac-
quaintance if he would not be eighteen in july
 he looked at me in a startled way and then
pulled a birth certificate card out of an inner coat
pocket much to my surprise upon looking over
the birth card i found i had guessed his age cor-
rectly although i had known him only an hour
and had never seen the card before nor had he
told me his age

  i was truly as much surprised as he when i
found i had through some mental or subconscious
mind process ascertained his age so correctly

  i suppose this will in no way alter your innate
skepticism but if your disbelief is as strong as my
belief i can understand the reason why

i believe that thought transference is a faculty

professor challenger again

the maracot deep and other stories
 by arthur conan doyle published by
 doubleday doran  co new york-
 

the lesser portion of this book con-
tains three short stories the story
of spedegnes dropper which
cricket enthusiasts may possibly be able
to enjoy the disintegration machine and
when the world screamed re-introduc-
ing professor challenger who was the chief
character in the lost world in the
disintegration machine prof challenger
very cleverly prevents the sale of this
terrible weapon to russia by disintegrating
the inventor thereby destroying the secret
most thoroughly since it existed only in
the inventors brains in when the earth
screamed prof challenger proves his
theory that the earth must be considered
a sentient being after a shaft five miles
deep has been sunk the earth resents this
interference by a very violent eruption
accompanied by an enormous noise sound-
ing like the screaming of mortally wounded
horses

  the maracot deep is easily the best
of the four stories comprising this book
a famous scientist dr maracot with three
companions descends in a steel diving cage
to a great depth a monster of the deep
bites the steel hawser in two and the cage
sinks five miles deep to the bottom

  just when they are about to suffocate
they are rescued by a party of subsea
dwellers descendants of atlantians who
once peopled lost atlantis this race liv-
ing on the ocean floor has conquered the
environment and has advanced far in all
kinds of science with the help of this
science they work out a way of returning
to the surface world again it is a very
ingenious and plausible tale full of fantas-
tic adventures and hair-raising thrills ex-
cept perhaps towards the end of the story
where doyles leaning towards the psy-
chic overwhelms his science-c a b

some prehistoric tales

the wonder stick  by stanton  a
 coblentz published by the cosmopolitan
 book corp new york-

the sons of the mammoth by walde-
 mar bogoras published by the cos-
 mopolitan book corp new york-

the day of the brown horde  by rich-
ard tooker published by pay son 

  clarke-

tales of prehistoric men and animals
antedating written records have al-
ways had a peculiar fascination for
me it seems to me exceedingly interest-
ing to read about the life of early man
to learn how he satisfied his need for food
drink and sleep how he defended himself
against heat and cold it fascinates me to
watch him shaping and improving his
primitive weapons to see how out of sheer
necessity were born the beginning of in-
dustry and transportation leading up  to
the domestication of animals the beginning
of agriculture and the formulating of laws
and customs which are still alive today

  four books have been published re-
cently all worth while reading and com-
paring very favorably with the earlier
masterpieces the story of ab by
waterloo and before adam by london

  three of these books are sectional that
is the action is laid within a somewhat
narrow circle whereas the book when
mammoths roamed the frozen earth
by heinrich schutz published by jonathan
cape  harrison smith covers an un-
certain region in europe dominated by a
glacier it is translated from the german
by frank barnes it will fascinate boys
and adults alike as a story although jt is
at the same time instructive for it is
founded on accurate scientific data

  the wonder stick tells us the
story of ru a despised dreamer and how
he finally became the eagle-hearted
how he invented bows and arrows and as
saviour of his tribe finally became its
chief the book is well written but the
poor illustrations do not match the high
quality of the story

  the next a translation from the rus-
sian by stephen graham is a scientific
reconstruction of the stone age man
showing how he lived loved and hunted a
very interesting episode is the appearance
of a live saurian who makes life miser-
able for the tribe in question

  the last is easily the best of the pre-
historic tales it is of particular interest
to us since its action takes place in north
america in a valley which now forms the
upper end of the gulf of california there
lived a tribe of troglodytes chieftained by
ag-tar the old man whose decree de-

manding that all -months-old children must
be able to walk and eat meat or die leads
to his ultimate destruction kaa an un-
named child is underdeveloped and is
doomed to die but is saved by his mother
who after an adventurous and perilous
flight finds refuge in a distant cave where
kaa grows up into a strong man the
spears which he invented later saved the
tribe from the ravages of saurians which
the tribe has been worshipping as gods
after ag-tar has been killed kaa be-
comes old man and abolishes human sacri-
fices and the killing of the weak and old
volcanic upheavals tear the land of the
tribe to pieces but under the leadership
of kaa they reach a safe locality where
the tribe continues to dwell in peace and
plenty

  the theme is well handled throughout
and the book holds the readers attention
from beginning to end-c a b

atlantis

the prince of atlantis by lillian eliz-
  abeth roy published by the educa-
  tional press-

if a future generation should discover
physical records of lost atlantis cover-
ing an advance social structure which
plato called the ideal society and also
covering a very highly developed science
having produced flying machines atomic
motors radio telephone etc these records
might very easily resemble the text of this
book it reads as though the author had
used actually existing records instead of
only a splendid imagination the story is
vividly interesting the characters are
alive and the prince of atlantis ranks
easily with the many fantastic novels
written around the meagre positive knowl-
edge existing of the lost continent
the maps gracing the inside covers are
as near authentic as they can be they
are based upon the researches of the
prince of monaco and his charts of the
oceans-c a b

ghosts

shuddersedited by cynthis asquith
 published by charles scribners sons
 new york-

  this book contains fifteen tales of hor-
ror murder mystery and ghosts

    we cannot avoid the belief that the remarkable
 instances of supposed thought transference and the
 similar phenomena are so few that they can be
 accounted for by appealing to chance or coincidence
 the writer admits that he possesses considerable
 innate skepticism as you call it although the many
 wonderful achievements of the past generations
 tend to remove skepticism and to substitute for it a
 degree of credulity but the most healthy feature
 of all this it is fair to say is to develop a good
 average in the mental processes and make one
 credulous to a certain extent and increase his
 receptivity to new ideas evolution of course can-
 not be effected by private and personal belief and
 unbelief in a sense it goes back  years at

    i am writing this for the discussions depart-

 if a space ship was traveling at one light-speed
 and a searchlight was turned on at the front and
 back would the front beam of light be traveling at
 two light-speeds and the back beam of light be
 traveling at no light-speed or not i think this
 would be true but do not know

    if the front beam of light was traveling at twice
 the speed of light or the rear beam traveling at no
 light-speed then how could there be any light  the
 same would be true of the lights of the interior

 the velocity of light is not affected by the
 velocity of the source according to modern theories
 if it were so affected your space-ship would emit
 no light in its wake and light at double the true

a birds-eye view of scientific
progress in amazing stories

editor amazing stories

  ive been a reader of amazing stories for a
year or two and i think it is a wonderful maga-
zine it gives me a birds-eye view of what our
scientists are doing and new theories to ponder
over i have no brickbats to throw i read what
i like of your stories and those i dont like i turn
past them

  personally i dont care for jules vernes stor-
ies but if your other readers do all right print
them by all means satisfy your readers as far
as possible

  i like interplanetary stories they give me an
idea of the plant and animal life that would be
found on other globes

  i would like to get a map or drawing of the
skies showing the position and also giving the
names of stars and planets especially a drawing
or picture of the solar system where can i get
some of these and how much will they cost do
you have them 

yours for a steady reader of amazing stories

robert hockaday
birdsboro pennsylvania

  the writer has had an illuminating experience
in connection with what you say about jules
vernes stories we have had several letters
highly commending the story which we have been
publishing the english at the north pole with
its sequel both about the polar regions and dis-
covery of the north pole one letter stated that
the correspondent knew that it was in all the
libraries in book form but acknowledged that he
had never read it until he read it in our pages so
that you see jules verne as it is sometimes prov-
erbially expressed has come into his own again
the northwest passage as it is called alluded to
in this story the way by water from the atlantic
to the pacific along the northern shore of the
american continent has long been sought for by
navigators since the days of queen elizabeth in
fact it was in the early part of this century that
the passage was made as noted in our footnote it
was the famous explorer amundsen in the auxil-
iary motor boat gjo who got through amid ice
floes channels between the islands and shoal water
as regards your wish for star maps you can get
them from various publishers we cannot supply
them here we wrote you personally giving an

interplanetary travel and ac-
celeration

editor amazing stories

  may i butt in with a few criticisms of your
editorial in the november issue of amazing stor-
ies

  dr sloane contends that interplanetary travel is
in practice impossible because the human body
would not be able to stand the strain of the acceler-
ations involved now i have made a few calcu-
lations from which it appears that such travel could
be arranged in such a way that the strains would
not be unendurable and at the same time without
prolonging the time of travel unduly

  the great difficulty is of course in overcoming
the earths gravitational pull during the first
 miles or so since the gravitational pull is
inversely as the square of the distance between
the centers of gravity of the two bodies-in this
case the distance of the space-flyer from the center
of the earth-when the machine has reached an
altitude of  miles the gravitational pull on it
and its passengers is reduced to a rather small
fraction th of that at the surface of the earth
and may be then regarded as a negligible factor-
a normal man weighing about  pounds there

  now although perhaps gravity and acceleration
are not quite the same thing yet we can regard
them as the same since their effects are similar
if we climb at a rate of  feet per second from
the earths surface we have an effect which is
equal to that of earth gravitation in addition to our
normal weight so that we should experience a
strain equivalent to doubling our weight tests
as well as common experience in raising men ver-
tically from deep mines have shown that the
human frame can stand this strain without injury
since the strain is necessarily to be more prolonged
we may find that in a space-flyer we should have
to reduce this somewhat but there is no doubt
that we could stand being lifted from the earth at
a rate of fifteen miles an hour not be it noted
an acceleration of that but a steady climb at that
rate as our distance from the earth increased and
the gravitational pull became less we could increase
this rate gradually but evenly so that by the end
of the first day we should be about  miles from
the earth we should of course leave tangentially
but the forward acceleration would be negligible at

 first by the end of the second day we should
 have reached an altitude of  miles and by
 the end of the fourth day or at any rate the fifth
 day we should be at least  miles from the
 earths surface

    now we may begin to accelerate in the direction
 of our course since earth gravity is negligible from
 now on an acceleration of  feet per sec-
 ond per second would give the flyer a change of
 velocity such that we should have the same ap-
 parent weight as though we were on earth pro-
 vided we made the end of the flyer nearest the
 earth our floor this acceleration of  f p sec
 per sec is equal to gravity on the earths surface
 so that an acceleration of that amount out in free
 space would give a similar effect allowing a lit-
 tle perhaps for the light gravitational pull of the
 earth and the rest of the solar system suppose
 since we are not entirely free from the earths in-
 fluence or drag we put our acceleration at  ft
 per sec per sec which is fifteen miles per hour
 per second this at the end of a day  hours
 rather since there is now no day or night gives
 a speed of about  miles an hour or ap-
 proximately  miles per day keep this ac-
 celeration for say four days and we have a speed
 of  miles per day and during this four-day
 period we have traveled some  miles on
 our journey now hold this speed by cutting off
 the power except for the little required for navi-
 gation and residual gravitational pulls inanother
 ten days we have gone a further  miles
 and are now  miles from home or about
 half way to either mars or venus should one of
 them be in a suitable position we have been in
 all about nineteen days doing this the second
 half of our journey will be simply a reversal of
 the first half we shall fall on to the other planet
 with a constantly decreasing velocity after we have
 reached a distance of about  or  million miles
 from its surface our floor now being the side
 towards this planet thus a journey to either
 of these nearest planets which needs a course of
 about fifty million miles if a tangential start and
 finish is to be made will occupy six or seven weeks
 under normal circumstances if we wish to go
 further say to mercury we shall in this case
 have to begin retarding considerably earlier since
 the suns drag will be appreciable in this region
 so that we should expect to take perhaps three
 months on this trip and to travel at a somewhat
 higher rate of speed in order to reach the outer
 planets-or rather their moons since their gravi-
 tational pull and other conditions are such as to
 make landing on them probably impracticable-we
 should need much longer time and should probably
 continue to accelerate for eight days to get a speed
 of  miles a day this is perhaps the
 fastest practicable speed since at speeds much
 greater than this relatively to the earth the lorenz
 fitzgerald contraction would become considerable
 and perhaps prevent greater speeds with the
 mechanism possible at this speed it would be a
 journey of many months to reach these planets or
 satellites and we should also have to make a big
 detour away from the plane of the ecliptic in order
 to avoid the asteroid belt with its great danger of
 collision with some of the small bodies there

   thus we see that as far as acceleration and
 gravity are concerned it is quite practicable to
 reach other worlds the difficulty is in designing
 a machine which is capable of doing it but with
 all due respect to dr sloane i believe that some
 day it will be done thirty years ago the wise
 ones of this world scoffed at the idea of mans fly-
 ing they regarded signor marconi as a madman
 and so on down the list let us be more tolerant
 and avoid the unwise use of this word impossible
 so that we shall not have to eat our words

    i am sure that some wise critic will bring for-
 ward the argument that in order to leave the earth
 at all it is necessary to attain a speed of seven
 miles per second so it is-for a projectile we
 are dealing with a machine which provides its own
 power and which can leave the earth at any
 speed it desires

    i really must apologize for making this letter so
 lengthy but i could not condense it without weak-
 ening the arguments

    just go ahead and publish some more interplan-
 etary stories many of them are good and to me
 they are always interesting

    a our correspondent has expressed a liking for
 interplanetary stories it will please him to know
 that we have quite a number on hand which will
 be published very soon you do not explain how
 you get your figure  but the point is that man
 can stand any constant motion through space with-
 out harm unless that mysterious lorenz-fitzgeraid
 contraction comes in and that it is only accelera-
 tion or change of speed which produces an effect

 similar to a change of weight this change might
 easily be fatal if the acceleration was positive
 there was a time when people were willing to say
 things were impossible the pendulum has swung
 the other way now we are afraid to say that
 things are impossible your very interesting letter
 is so long and so much in detail that it speaks for
 itself and really needs no comments-editor

 a letter from dr miles j breuer

 dear mr barnett

   i am glad that a letter from you with your ad
 dress appeared in the amazing stories i am
 glad of the opportunity to congratulate you on the
 sportsmanlike manner with which you took the
 savage attack that i made on the technical points
 in your story

   i am writing to you personally with the special
 purpose of remonstrating with you about one thing
 you say i assure him meaning myself that i
 shall in the future avoid subjects that require a
 knowledge of practical bacteriology

   now that would be just too bad if you did that
 you are too skilful a story writer and get out too
 good a type of stimulating and original story to
 permit your work to suffer because of such a small
 matter there is a much better way to get around
 the subject

   you have excellent and original ideas they
 ought to involve bacteriology and other technical
 matters when they do get some help on them from
 some technical man who knows the bacteriology
 and cannot write stories i wrote a story which
 has been accepted by amazing stories involving
 some technical points in artillery about which i
 knew nothing but i have a friend who was a
 lieutenant in the field artillery during the war i
 submitted my problem to him and he was im-
 mensely interested in mapping out my material
 then when a draft of my story was on paper i
 submitted it to him for final censorship in that
 way i secured soundness in my artillery section
 and made a stronger friend than ever he was
 very much complimented because of my confidence
 in his knowledge of artillery

    wouldnt it be better for you to do that than to
 deprive readers of your ideas for stories which
 might involve bacteriology

   after all no one person can know everything
 and the technical folks always seem to be glad to
 give assistance

   i should be delighted to hear from you person-
 ally in case you either agree or disagree with this
 view in fact i should be more than delighted to
 be of friendly and complimentary service to you
 in helping with the technical points of any of your
 stories which involve such technical matters as i am
 familiar with

    cordially

   although this letter was addressed to mr
 barnett it is so very excellently put and dr
 breuers good spirit is shown so clearly that we are
 taking the risk of publishing it even without his
 permission dr breuer who is a very high
 authority in his special field has long been and we
 hope always will be one of the favorite contributors
 to amazing stories and his letter shows a truly
 sportsman-like spirit-editor

a letter from an advocate of the
prerogative of youth

 editor amazing stories

   i have been a constant reader of this magazine
 and have a file of them-every issue for the last
 four years in a recent discussions i saw
 the letter of mr vernon and was exceedingly
 wroth he in his sarcastic letter denouncing
 sarcasm wishes to quell the budding thirst for
 knowledge in the younger generation-youths who
 will form the nuclei of tomorrows citizenry let
 him ridicule with his own expansive vocabulary-
 the same trait is in mr saunders let him remove
 the beam from his own eye ere be goes mote-
 hunting

   now will mr vernon having reached the age
 of discretion sit back and listen to reason is he
 humiliated when subjected to the criticism of the
 younger generation to whom are manifested faults
 unseen by the octogenerians of his class surely
 he is not one of those self-sufficient ones able to
 forego all criticism does he not realize the value
 of criticism either censure or approval from all
 readers be they male or female-sixteen or sixty
 does he wish to limit this column to a few old
 fogeys with one foot in the grave whose sole in-
 terest in science is good cure for rheumatism
 patriarchs that should abdicate and allow the
 world to progress without them

my ancestors fought for the privilege of free
speech and i do not intend to sacrifice it merely

the man i pity most

 poor old jones no one had any use for him no
 one respected him across his face i read one harsh
 word-failure he just lived on a poor worn-oufc
 imitation of a man doing his sorry best to get on in
 the world if he had realized just one thing he could
 have made good he might have been a brilliant success

    there are thousands of men like jones they too
  could be happy successful respected and loved but they
  cant seem to realize the one big fact-that practically ev-
  erything worth while living for depends upon strength
  -upon live red-blooded he-man muscle

    everything you do depends upon strength no matter
  what your occupation you need the health vitality and
  clear thinking only big strong virile muscles can give
  you when you are ill the strength in those big muscles
  pulls you through at the office in the farm fields or on
  the tennis courts youll find your success generally de-
  pends upon your muscular development

heres a short cut to strength and success

    but you say it takes years to build my body up ts
  the point where it will equal those of athletic champions
  it does if you go about it without any system but there
  a scientific short cut and thats where i come in

 days is ai  need

    in just  days i can do things with your body you
  never thought possible with just a few minutes work
  every morning i will add one full inch of real liv
  muscle to each of your arms and two whole inches across
  your chest many of my pupils have gained more than
  that but i guarantee to do at least that much for
  you in one short month your neck will grow shanely
  your shoulders begin to broaden before you know it
  youll find people turning around when you pass women
  will want to know you your boss will treat you with a
  new respect your friends will wonder what has come over
  you youll look ten years younger and youll feel like
  it too

 strengthen those inner organs tos

    but im not through with you i want ninety days in
  all to do the job right and then all i ask is that you
  look yourself over

    what a marvelous change those great squared shoul-
  ders that pair of huge lithe arms those firm shapely
  legs youll be just as fit inside as you are out too
  because i work on your heart your liver-all of your

 the style of letter written by these intelligent peo-

   as to that toy phrase let mr vernon be assured
 that never again will youth be held in check by the
 narrow-mindedness of people overcome by mis-
 placed privileges and authority

   in the long time i have read amazing stories i
 have found no story no drawing without merit
 even those in the style of the roger bacon
 formula were scientific to such an extent that
 their very dryness was interesting but i prefer
 the interplanetary type such as around the uni-

 had an ingenious plot gave good descriptions and
 corresponded well to the title-amazing stories

   no one wishes to quell the budding thirst for
 knowledge in the younger generation the pecu-
 liarity of the younger generation as you term it
 is that they are apt to be very positive in their
 ideas their minds seem to be inelastic they
 have not yet had all the shocks and disappoint-
 ments which we older people have had and their
 criticisms therefore are apt to be rather arbitrary
 and rather severe but we have a large number of
 young readers and we have received some astonish-
 ingly good letters from them which we always
 take great pleasure in publishing we are cer-
 tainly the advocate of youth but it would be kind
 of you we think not to abuse the older generation
 as you are inclined to because some of these days
 if you will have a long life you will find your-
 self growing old and then you will feel rather
 strange in looking back and seeing the letters you
 have written if you have written many like this
 one abusing in a sense the older generation they
 cannot help being old any more than you can help
 being young so practice moderation in your
 criticisms amazing stories which you compli-
 ment so highly in the concluding paragraph of your
 letter is not edited by a young man either so here
 we are bringing the old and the young together and
 we are only too delighted to feel that our efforts
 have been pleasing to a young reader as we under-
 stand you to be you have our very best wishes
 for your future advance in science-editor

the second third and fourth
dimensions

 editor amazing stories

    i have read with great interest the many stories
 in your publications which deal with the so-called
 fourth dimension while i do not presume to
 state definitely that the fourth dimension is non-
 existent still i would like to correct the erroneous
 statements generally used by your authors in ex-
 plaining the fourth dimensional theory

    it seems to be generally conceded by writers of
 scientific fiction that the correct thing in fourth
 dimensional tales is to have one of the characters
 either moving himself bodily through the fourth
 dimension or moving some other fourth dimensional
 object with a three dimensional handle such as
 the now famous hyper-forceps of mr olsen

    let me point out using mr olsens own method
 of two-dimensional comparison the fallacies in the
 theory of any three-dimensional being moving in or
 working with the fourth dimension

    it is stated that every object must have three
 dimensions to exist such being the case every
 flatlander must have three dimensions whether
 or not he realizes it supposing some eminent two-
 dimensional scientist were to become convinced
 that all two-dimensional objects must have a third
 and hitherto unknown dimension by placing two
 dimensional objects one upon the other he could
 eventually construct an object with a third dimen-
 sion at right angles to the two known dimensions
 but this two dimensional being could not move in
 the third dimension to place the two dimensional
 objects one upon the other unless he had a three
 dimensional tool with which to work

    since he could not move in the third dimension
 without first obtaining a three dimensional tool and
 since he could not obtain a three-dimensional tool
 without first moving in the third dimension   
 the conclusion is obvious no two dimensional
 being can move in the third dimension or work
 with any three dimensional object without assist-
 ance coming in some manner from this same third
 dimension

    likewise a three dimensional being in order to
 obtain an object with a fourth dimension at right
 angles to the other three must work with three
 dimensional objects placing them one upon the
 other by moving them through the fourth dimension
 until he has a four-dimensional tool with which to
 work and he is certainly incapable of producing

 a four-dimensional tool without motion in the fourth
 dimension

   therefore mr editor i present the following
 indisputable fact no three-dimensional being can
 move in the fourth dimension or work with any
 four-dimensional tool unless he is the recipient of
 aid from the fourth dimensional world

                               karl myers
                               wildwood n j

    your observations are certainly logical and seem
 to invalidate the famous as you put it hyper-
 forceps of the story you refer to as we look at
 it the fourth dimension does give a good basis for
 scientific romance it is at once surprising and
 even interesting to know how seriously the mathe-
 matical conception termed the fourth dimension
 has been taken by many people some have even
 gone to the extent of writing books about it the
 tessaract has been speculated about and pictured
 as if it was a chance for the everyday reader and
 writer to speculate about this recondite and mathe-
 matical subject when the most gifted scientist does
 not have a tangible theory about gravitation-some-
 thing whose existence we know but whose cause we
 are ignorant of it is well not to take the fourth
 dimension too seriously except where it belongs
 which is in higher mathematics-editor

comments on some of our stories
the interior heat of the earth
the paper of amazing stories

 editor amazing stories

    i have read the october amazing stories from
 cover to cover and find much of interest as well
 as some things the other way

    your story death from the skies was very
 interesting but has some flaws that cannot be
 neglected finding the origin of the meteors by
 tracing their trajectory as described in the earths
 atmosphere might be possible but as for predicting
 the landing point of the projectiles that is not de-
 scribed at all the meteors are not luminous until
 they reach the earths atmosphere and hence cannot
 be seen nor can any idea be gained as to where
 they are to fall mr verrill also neglects to ex-
 plain why it was that a specimen of the meteors
 would ascend with the current on and descend when
 it was turned off while the large meteors kept on
 going away from the earth when the current was
 turned off with all these flaws the story was
 very interesting

    one leg too many was not so interesting to
 me it was well written but i do not believe
 that technicalities have any place in a magazine
 meant to be scientific i do not care in general
 for stories having to do with surgery biology or
 allied subjcts i prefer things purely scientific
 with a good scientific explanation for everything
 i like stories of unknown places unusual hap-
 penings and such

    the secret kingdom is fairly interesting so
  far i think it a little off the line of scientific-
  tion being more of an adventure story but later
  instalments may prove more interesting

    i liked the chamber of life very much it
 was an interesting and unique way of presenting
 the authors idea of an ideal life as a story it
 was remarkably interesting

    the idea of having a valley heated by steam
 from the interior of the earth in the midst of the
 arctic snows is quite an original idea i was ex-
 pecting some explanation of the surprising stature
 of the arctic giants however which was not forth-
 coming it was interesting to see science overcome
 tradition i think this demonstrates the spirit of
 the present age the description of the wonders
 in such a queer land were quite interesting but
 the introduction was too long before the real ex-
 periences and description of the queer land start
 he could just as well have cracked-up next to
 the canyon and had the real story begin immediate-
 ly scientific writers should learn that stories of
 this nature are never improved by a long intro-
 duction but quite the other way

    if you would improve the make-up of the maga-
  zine i suggest that you improve the quality of the
  paper in the first place

                 herman l danforth

         oakwood ave webster groves mo

    the part of this letter which really calls for
  comment is that where the writer refers to having a
  valley heated by heat from the interior of the earth
  this brings up that strange fact that there is so
  much heat in the interior of the earth that coal and
  oil and heating substances could be wiped out of
  existence if we could only tap the enormous reser-
  voir of incandescence that is present not so many
  feet below us the paper of amazing stories is a
  rough surfaced paper which is exceedingly good
  for the eyes highly polished surfaced paper is
  opposed by oculists as its dazzling effect gives

 a very sensible letter of criti-
 cism and also commendatory
 of our efforts
 editor amazing stories

    as most of your correspondents scera to jump
 right into an unanaestheticised vivisection of your
 magazine and in their fervid imagination liter-
 ally tear it to pieces i suppose i might as well
 follow the general plan of attack

    the cover seems to draw more jovian lightning
  than any other feature i personally think they
  are a wow they fulfil every function of a mag-
  azine cover you enter a drug store suddenly
  livid color and weird design sneak up and sock
  you in the eye you focus your eye on this ar-
  resting phenomenon subconsciously and reflexly
  what are these three black rhombohedrons with
  the cruciform windows these bakers choco-
  late shaped tri-propped what-nots bask in the
  beams of myriad search lights yellow-cored at
  start carried by planes and in the foreground a
  tri-propeller ship bearing turbo generators projects
  a ray which paints destruction on the nearest
  what-not

    if scientifically inclined you are at least inter-
  ested curiosity seizes you the dynamic sym-
  metry plus unanswered questions as to whats
  what assails you

    this is the september number and if you are
 interested in scientifiction you buy it if you
 do you are a regular subscriber because the in-
 side beats the cover for interest if not you
 never would buy it one look at the picture on
 the september number tells you more of the
 guts of the magazine than any title such as
 scientifiction printed in letters one foot high

    now as to the stories i like one you like
 another why environment plus what we do for
 a living as a scientist engaged in scientific
 work all day i find relaxation in stories that fol-
 low known science exactly and rigidly to the limit
 of the known and soar at the end of the runway
 into the unknown along pseudo-scientific lines

   the red peril is one we may fight a
 bacteriological war not necessarily with the
 ussr within the next twenty years i
 hope not as i would go as an artillery officer
 everyone hopes not now as this story progresses
 it leaves the present possible and on scientific
 basis enters the future probable now as a
 scientist i know that an alternator with an in-
 finite cycle to produce an  wave length is pres-
 ent impossible

    this does not annoy me i bought the book for
  scientifiction now praising one shall i cut
  another storys throat i dont like cold
  light the moon woman the young old
  man the coral experiment not enough
  science too much hot air others feel the other
  way no doubt rightly i lent a bacteriologist who
  is a friend of mine the september number and
  he enjoyed both the red peril and the white
  army microcosmic buccaneers opens new
  vistas of thought impossible thats a word
  i dont use although if any story was ever im-
  probable this one is what of it i like it

    your duty is to keep your stories ever on the
  frontier of science a corona stretching into the
  unknown lets talk about gravity screens a
  present impossible lets assume as pro-
  fessor olsen of red peril states a screen of
  infinite density stops gravity an electromagnetic
  wave of  wave length mr tulane in the
  dimension segregator makes this screen by
  cooling iron to absolute zero whereupon the elec-
  trons and protons remain in contact due to some
  mysterious attraction lead is a swiss cheese
  to this stuff would this cause our atmosphere to
  leave us i think not gravity is the attraction
  of every particle directly as the mass inversely
  as the square of the distance suppose we have a
  mile square gravity screen and our earth as
  the home team and the moon our strongest
  tidemaker and attractant as opponent in a celes-
  tial tug of war with the fickle atmosphere as a
  prize

    diagram it in your mind in a position most
 favorable to the moon and the gravity screen
 considering centrifugal force at the equator on
 the moons side and the expansive desire of the
 gas the screen covers a very small part of the
 earths surface the earth is very near the moon
 far the moon is less massive now for each
 molecule of air the screen only screens matter in
 a conoid or pyramidoid if the screen is polygon-
 ical of which the molecule is the apex and the
 masked area or area in which matter cannot
 attract the particle comprises a frusto-conoid or
 frustro pyramid stretching to infinity and the
 surface of which is the locus of a circumnavigating
 line tangential to the periphery of the screen and
 passing through said apex each particle of matter

not in this attracts it and as we leave the
earth we finally reach a particle that has most
of the earth pulling it back and a less mass at a
greater distance the moon in opposition

  the problem resolves itself into proportion and
size if the screen is big enough the moon big
enough and close enough the rotation of the earth
fast enough etc the air leaves if not we keep
it in spite of a gravity screen

  and to make it leave you need a gigantic screen
of continental proportions in my opinion this
takes no account of huyghens principle or the
ability of waves to reclose on passing a screen

   this well thought-out letter tells its own story
it is written by a scientist who knows whereof he
speaks and his statement that he enjoys our mag-
azine and finds relaxation in our stories of the
impossible at the present time remember is a
true gratification to the editors the analysis of
a gravity screen is interesting but our friendly
critic does say that we have a fine magazine
we are lending every effort to make it so-
editor	

a letter of interesting criticism

editor amazing stories

  though i consider that the discussions de-
partment is a useless waste of space i am com-
pelled to write this letter to tell you of my appre-
ciation from the time that amazing stories first
came out until about three months ago i read
every copy that i could get hold of

  then growing disgusted with the monotonous
round of interplanetary stories stories of the
future etc i entirely stopped reading them yes-
terday feeling in the mood for a little scientifiction
i stopped in at the store and bought a copy of the
october amazing stories i was surprised-need
i say delightfully-to find the whole tone of the
magazine changed the first thing that i noticed
was the covcr how different from the lurid glar-
ing covers of the former copies lets hope that it
stays that way and doesnt revert to the former
garish type

  my joyous approval met with a slight setback
when i came to the illustrations of the first story
however this was more than made up for by the
other illustrations including the cover if these
covers continue i will be able to read the maga-
zine without first tearing off the cover whenever
i try to get my friends to read amazing stories
they take one look at the cover and laugh at me
for reading trash

  here comes another bouquet this time for the
story the chamber of life really this story
is almost intellectual and it made a deep impression
on me it was worth the cost of the whole maga-
zine i also enjoyed the story one leg too
many immensely-

  on the whole mr editor i think that if you
keep up the good work and run more stories and
covers like those in the october issue the maga-
zine will be improved one hundred per cent i
know that if you do this i will subscribe and get
as many other subscribers as i can

 put you into our discussions column and shall
 watch for more of your valuable comments and
 above all we are glad that you like amazing
 stories-editor

our november issue commended
-the artist problem-the size
of amazing stories

 editor amazing stories

   i would call the november issue of amazing
 stories an all-star issue but for two things they
 are the interior illustrations and the style of the
 story titles i could hardly ask for better cover
 pictures than those on the last three issues of
 amazing stories if the illustrations were as
 good as the cover pictures they would be o k i
 like the old style of story headings better than
 the present ones you spoil the pictures by putting
 part of the titles and stories somewhere on them
 as for your artists in the november issue wesso
 is the best one and morey isnt so bad but bob
 dean mcgerr and wallit are not so good

   why have you decreased the size of amazing
 stories  it is at least a quarter of an inch shorter
 than usual i noticed this some time ago you
 are improving on your stories except for the
 secret kingdom which has no place in a scien-
 tific magaine in my estimation microcosmic buc-
 caneers by harl vincent was the best story in
 your november issue

    what happened to those two mastermcn of scien-
 tifietion a merritt and ray cummings

                      jack darrow

              n spaulding ave chicago 
 it is hardly fair to criticize artists so severely
 for each one has his own specialty and it is not
 too much to say that several of the last issues of
 amazing stories have been in a sense devoted to
 finding the best artists to illustrate stories of tke
 very definite type which we publish mr wesso
 we feel is one of our absolute stock illustrators
 and mr morey bids fair to be the same bob dean
 is excellent in anything in the shape of humor
 but of that of course we give comparatively little
 the real size of amazing stories has not been re-
 duced the type page has been constant as a
 matter of fact you have probably noticed that be-
 ginning with the december issue we added 
 pages to the magazine-editor

an old-time fallacy about the
rocket or any reaction
engine

 editor amazing stories

   i was very much interested in your editorial in
 the november issue of your magazine regarding
 interplanetary travel

   you state that a rocket can be propelled in a
 vacuum to prove this you state that the air has
 nothing to do with the motion of a rocket and
 nothing to do with the recoil of a gun except to act
 as a retarding force inasmuch as i am not a
 scientist i hesitate to flatly contradict your state-
 ment but i wish to say that rifles and rifle shoot-
 ing is my hobby and i have thereby learned that
 this statement of yours is slightly in error

   the velocity of recoil of a rifle is due to the
 reaction of the expanding powder gases upon the
 projectile and upon the air the primary phase
 takes place while the projectile is moving through
 the barrel the secondary phase is caused by the
 escaping muzzle blast striking the atmosphere and
 forcing the rifle backwards velocity of recoil due
 to the second phase has been found by use of the
 sebert velocimeter to be three-tenths of the total
 velocity of recoil

    proof of this secondary phase can be found in the
 use of the cutts compensator a device attached to
 the muzzle of rifles instead of allowing the
 escaping muzzle blast to force the gun backward
 the blast is re-directed and forced to actually pull
 the gun forward further proof can be found by
 cutting off the barrel of the springfield rifle or sim-
 ilar ones with the service barrel length of 
 inches and a charge of  grains of du pont
 i m r powder no  behind the -grain
 boattail bullet the recoil is fairly negligible re-
 tain the same charge and reduce the barrel length
 to  or  inches and the recoil becomes very
 severe although the gun will not develop the same
 muzzle energy as before as barrel length is re-
 duced the powder gases are still expanding at the
 muzzle instead of having a reduced pressure these
 gases still having a high velocity strike the air and

travel

 my banjo made me popular overnight

 vtd mixer-thats what everyone in town had me down
 for they were right i couldnt sing couldnt play
 whenever there was a party  was at it-but not in it
 then i learned to play the banjo studied home at
 night-it was so easy so simple so much fun that
 almost in no time i could play the most difficult pieces
 -classical jazz hot numbers

 one night about a month ago i played at a small
 gathering everyone was amazed people noticed me
 now who never before knew i existed and to cap the

 climax mr --- one of our leading merchants

 told me he never knew a fellow with so much genuine
 personality later on he made me a fine business proposi-
 tion-said he only wanted live wires in his organization
 take it fiom me it was the turning point in my life

force the gun backwards due to reduced barrel
friction and time the primary recoil is not as great
but the secondary phase more than makes up for it
slap on a cutts compensator to re-direct the muz-
zle blast and only the primary phase will be felt
the air therefore plays a large part in assisting
recoil

   i cannot see how a rocket will work in a vacuum
inasmuch as there is nothing for the escaping gases
to strike fire slow dynamite on a rock and noth-
ing will happen the explosion is so slow that the
air gives way before the gases can react on the
rock try a dynamite high in nitro-glycerin con
terit it will detonate and release its gases so
rapidly that there is not time to displace the air
and the rock will be shattered in this regard i
would like to suggest that someone prove or dis-
prove this experiment by making a very small
rocket and firing it under an exhausted bell jar
ill bet you a cigar that it will never move pro
viding of course that the volume of the bell jar
is great enough so that the exhausted powder gases
will not increase the density within the jar

  in spite of my belief i am open to conviction
if rockets can be made to work in a vacuum i will
be glad to receive full data upon the experiments

   your paper is quite interesting the stories are
a little too wild for me but i do enjoy your edi-
torials

  why use a rocket anyway why not a 
browning machine gun the bullets would cer-
tainly furnish a medium for obtaining the neces-
sary recoil in a vacuum not much energy would
be necessary due to lack of head resistance and
the mg would certainly furnish a much smoother
flow of power it might also come in handy upon
reaching ones destination if anyi

                   e m hoskinson

 south rd lincoln nebr

   we print this letter as it goes to show how the
erroneous conception of action and reaction persists
the air which our correspondent thinks of as a sort
of wall or abutment for the gases from the rocket to
push against does not operate in that way it im-
pedes the motion of the rocket by its resistance so
that a rocket would go much faster in the vacuum
so-called of space than in the air this fact is
based on newtons law of action and reaction god-
dard of rocket fame has we believe proved it ex-
perimentally-editor

europe and is now back after a very interesting
trip amazing stories is one of a number of
magazines published by this firm we think the
quarterly and monthly will come out on the
dot as regards specifying authors we wish
you could see the pile of good stories and manu-
scripts which are awaiting publication we feel
that we are certainly much appreciated by authors
and your letter shows us how much we are also
appreciated by some of our readers-editor

an interesting letter from one
of our authors

editor amazing stories

  there may be some difference of opinion as to
the desirability of permitting authors to make use
of the correspondence columns of our magazine
but so long as we refrain from anything resemb-
ling controversy with our readers and confine our-
selves to explaining points in our stories which
have aroused interest or doubt letters from au-
thors will serve a good end with this object in
view therefore i will endeavor to clear up some
incidents in my own humble contributions to which
readers have taken exception

  in the face of isis one or two readers are
rather contemptuous of poor old prof wads-
worths theory that a body deprived of gravitation
would leave the earth at a tangent i must con-
fess to a deliberate hoax on this point as i ex-
plained to the editor at the time i sent him the
manuscript of the story i hoped-a hope which
has been justified-to set my readers to thinking
for themselves the fact is that the worthy pro-
fessor was both right and wrong the following
is the logical explanation

  if it were possible to release a body from the
action of gravity that body would partake
of the exact movement of the surface of the earth
at the point where the body was resting at the
moment of its release the motion of the earths
surface is a compound of several different move-
ments ie the revolution of the earth upon its
axis its rotation around the sun the flight of
the solar system through space etc now any
straight line element of this compound motion will
not produce any change in the relative positions of
the earth and the gravity-free body you will re-
member that when the travelers in jules vernes
projectile threw the dead dog out of the port-hole
the body continued to travel side by side with the
projectile

  the earths orbit and the flight of the solar
system through space approximate for short
periods of time so nearly to straight lines that
their effect upon a gravity-free body would be
scarcely perceptible therefore a body suddenly
freed from gravity at the equator would leave the
earth at a speed of about  miles per hour and
would travel in a straight fine tangent to the
earths surface but-and its a great big but
-the observer standing upon the equator would
also be traveling at a speed of  miles per hour
in the same direction almost keeping pace with
the gravity-free body which would therefore
appear to rise almost vertically above his head
the apparent motion would be at first extremely
slow and would accelerate rapidly but this ac-
celeration is only apparent

  the inquiring reader may be interested in
drawing a diagram to illustrate these conditions
draw a circle with a radius of  inches
  divide the circumference into 
equal arcs each of which will be  inch and will
represent the movement of the earth in one hour
now taking one of these points draw a long
line tangent to the circle this represents the
path of the gravity-free body mark this line off
in inches each inch representing the flight of the
body in one hour number the marks on the
straight line    etc and also number the
hour-marks on the circle similarly starting in
both cases from the tangent point calling that
zero remember that when the observer is at
points    etc the radius lines through those
points represent straight up to the observer it
is now easy to trace the apparent position of the
body hour by hour and it will be seen that it
seems to travel backward ie toward the west
when a line from a given point on the tangent
line to the corresponding point on the circle is
at right angles to the radius the body will appear
to set below the western horizon

  in connection with this same story another
reader raised the point that it is unreasonable to
suppose that an etheric force like gravity could
be nullified or increased by a chemical reaction
come come leaving out the fact that we do
not know anything about the nature of gravity it
is everyday experience that etheric forces are
modified by chemical reactions for example
suppose you allow a ray of light to pass through

 a tank filled with a solution of common salt and
 fall upon one of those little light motors we
 sometimes see in shop windows the motor vanes
 revolve merrily now pour into the salt solution
 a little silver nitrate the vanes immediately
 cease to revolve why because a chemical re-
 action has rendered the solution partially opaque
 to the etheric vibrations of light similar ex-
 amples might be given for magnetism electricity
 and radiant heat-all etheric forces perhaps
 then why not for gravity

   just one more point and i am done a reader
 of gold dust and star dust raises the point
 whether the boxes of gold would have returned
 through the fourth dimension the first time the
 power beam was turned on without the interven-
 tion of dr hilary corwin the whole story is
 wildly imaginative of course and hardly subject
 to logical reasoning but i think this reader has
 missed the point it was not the power beam
 itself but the sudden shutting off of the beam
 which produced the tremendous strain in the
 ether which hurled the boxes into the fourth
 dimension hence corwins illustration of the
 rubber band the beam was normally supposed
 to be started gradually and built up to full power
 by means of rheostats corwins friend the en-
 gineer turned on the full force of the beam
 instantaneously thus producing the violent counter-
 strain which brought back the boxes

    all nonsense of course but at least logical

 we are very glad indeed to have our authors
 write letters to us your letter is so full that
 it requires no particular comment your conclud-
 ing statement is quite amusing as is your desiring
 logic in the story-editor

the question of long or short
stories

 editor amazing stories

   i have just completed reading a s for decem-
 ber and i thought i would write a letter to you and
 comment on various things

   first of all your short stories are too short
 in many of the stories you have barely gotten in-
 terested in the characters and the plot when the
 story ends and too many times it has an un-
 happy ending what is the need of the inventor
 meeting an unhappy death etc  it is not a neces-
 sity for the author of a short story to kill off the
 hero and heroine many of the short stories you
 have published at various times had a happy end-
 ing some of these were very interesting too i
 refer in particular to the tide projectile trans-
 portation co john jones dollar and similar
 stories i think that you should be running one
 serial of about three or four issues in length at a
 time in each issue publish a fairly long instal-
 ment of the serial two quite long short stories
 that is one-issue stories such as green splotches
 around the universe armaggedon and mi-
 crocosmic buccaneers then publish one or two
 short stories such as i have mentioned in the first
 part of this paragraph then of course the discus-
 sions department this might make the magazine
 a little longer than it is now but i am sure that
 none of your readers would object to this prob-
 ably it would help your circulation to increase
 too which would help pay for the additional size
 of the magazine

   now for the kind of stories to use for the
 long stories i would suggest that you vary the kind
 of stories used first let us say run an inter-
 stellar or interplanetary serial then for the next
 use one like the moon pool then use one in-
 volving the fourth dimension time strange races
 or similar types by all means be sure that the
 human interest is present in the story and dont
 let the author be afraid to use his imagination a
 writer of scientifiction has just as much right to
 use poetic license as any other writer providing
 of course that he does not violate the laws of
 science too recklessly i might add that i have
 not noticed this to any great extent if at all in
 a s so far then too i think that most of us
 like a happy ending after you have suffered with
 the hero through a story if it is a good one you
 feel quite a personal interest in him and of course
 a happy ending is in order i myself prefer in-
 terplanetary and interstellar stories about the best
 of all for short stories i would suggest humor-
 ous inventions such as those of hicks every
 once in a while fourth dimensional time rays
 different forms of life unexplored places on the
 earth the atom and even interstellar stories are
 all very good if well written dont be afraid of
 imagination happy endings and personal interest
 in these either it is in the short stories that the
 unhappy ending has reached its peak it seems that

another  raise

 why thats the third increase ive had in a year
 it shows what special training will do for a man

    every mail brings letters from some of the thou-
 sands of students of the international correspondence

  the author is afraid to let the inventor and his

    at present you have a very fine staff if it may
  be called such working for you a hyatt ver-
  rill clare winger harris dr miles j breuer
  harl vincent edward l rementer the klines
  leslie stone dr dressier w alexander and
  others are very fine by all means continue the
  stories by these as to pictures i think that your
  cover illustrations are very fine in many respects
  better than in the past however your artist who
  lias illustrated the secret kingdom is not so
  good his drawings are not lifelike and almost
  made me dubious of the story when the first instal-
  ment was published your other artists are o k
  as to quantity i personally prefer the old idea
  of one picture in front of each story and no more
  the space can be more interestingly and usefully
  used for stories in my estimation i especially
  do not like pictures of the characters of a story
  my reason for this is that they are usually disap
  pointing in reading a story i unconsciously form
  a picture of the characters when i see a picture
  of them it usually differs from my idea and is
  disappointing

    the discussions department is very interesting
  and should be continued just as it is i agree
  heartily with the letter of r h thomas in the
  december issue not only with his answer to mr
  vernons letter of a couple of months previous
  but also with his view of around the universe

    your magazine is an extremely interesting one
  the type of stories are thought-provoking and i
  feel sure that they have interested many people in
  science or augmented their interest if they already
  had one since science will progress according to
  the number of people interested in it and since
  civilization depends on science and will advance a
  science does you are doing your bit toward tb
  progress of civilization

    you are the second correspondent who suggests
  some long serials consciously or unconsciously
  we have rather avoided these feeling that each
  magazine should be complete in itself as a rule
  although we have given a number of two-part
  stories we are trying to give the variety in stor-
  ies which you suggest sometimes similar stories
  will come together under the various conditions of
  the editorial department but we try to avoid it-
  your suggestions we consider of very decided in-
  terest and they will receive full consideration we
  flatter ourselves by adopting the terminology which
  you employ calling our regular authors our staff
  writers though of course literally they are not
  the discussions columns involve far more work
  far more time and far more thought than one
  would believe but we take the greatest interest in
  them and words of appreciation from our readers
  such as you give us are warmly appreciated we
  shall certainly never give these columns up-

a good word from a stunt avia

trix not aviator

  editor amazing stories

    after reading the childish letter written by the
  high school skeptic it seems your magazine
  is in line for a good word from one also of high
  school age but who has been out of school for
  four years

    i am an aviatrix holding two worlds records
  in parachute jumping and have been doing stunt-
  ing etc for four years and still enjoy aviation
  stories immensely though they are usually far-
  fetched and sometimes impossible but they have
  a basic foundation so it is with your other
  stories one who is the least bit interested in
  science will appreciate scientific fiction at least
  so it seems to me

    i have been reading your magazine for two
  years and expect to continue reading them as long
  as they are as good as they are now and always
  have been

    we thank our fair correspondent for her ap-
  preciation of our efforts aviation is a topic fre
  quently used by our authors with expansion into
  interplanetary stories the position which amaz-
  ing stories has acquired tells us that there is a
  class of readers who enjoy natural science pre-
  sented in fiction and used as the framework for
  stories the great difficulty in our work is keep-
  ing the science in line with the more recent de-
  velopments for what are called classic physics
  are subject to attack and modification to a very
  great extent-editor
