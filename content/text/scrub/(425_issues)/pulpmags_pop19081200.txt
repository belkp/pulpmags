the freshness anl health of the girls
looks she might have been some young
judith of the wilderness as she stepped
across the ragged garden to the cabin
door

  inside the semidarkness made by the
drawn curtains of some dark cotton
stuff her brother lav relaxed in sleep
upon an army cot she stood in the
doorway watching him the stern
beauty of her look softened her eyes
were able to discern in the tanned boy-
ish face with the closed eyes and the
half-smile some traces of the rosy little
boy she had adored with the whole-
hearted adoration of an older sister
she passed softly through the room so
as not to disturb him and in the lean-
to kitchen beyond busied herself with
preparations for the morning meal by
and by she heard the sound of stirring
in the next room and in an instant red
lawson appeared at the door the
recollections that had made her glance
at him sleeping a tender one were ban-
ished by the sight of him awake there
was no longer any suggestion of rosy

t s i d e the cabin
which perched itself
half-way up the bare
hillside snuggling its
back against the slope
like a child seated upon
a fathers knee there
stood a small tent the
tun had not climbed well over the east-
ern plateau when the flap of this tent
parted and a girl clear-eyed rosy and
brown from her morning ablutions
stepped outside as she fastened the
flaps open that the air might penetrate
to the interior you saw that it was an
improvised dressing-room set forth
with rough benches holding pails and
tubs

  for all her splendid young color
which for a moment blinded the eyes
of the beholders to less immediate ef-
fects it was a somber face which
fronted the cabin the broad fore-
head the straight fine black eyebrows
the delicately chiseled unsmiling line of
the red lips all produced an effect al-
most tragic once one had gotten beyond

babyhood or innocent boyhood about
this gaping stretching unshorn young
bravo

  lord but im tired he remarked
between two yawns did you hear me
come in last night 

  of course and the next time you
mustnt try to come in so quietly it
frightened me almost sounded so
creepy

  did you wake up before i came in
or after red manner was almost
anxiously questioning

  i didnt hear you until the boards
creaked why was there some one
with you that you didnt want me to
know about crystal proceeded to the
heart of the matter with great direct-
ness

  aw dont you bother your head
about who was with me or who wasnt
advised her relieved brother say how
soon will the grub be ready

  she did not answer but with com-
pressed lips and veiled eyes of anxiety
she went on with her simple prepara-
tions by and by the feast was spread
upon the oilcloth-covered table-bacon
and biscuits and coffee red ate vora-
ciously and his sister watched him
keenly conscious of the fact that he
was avoiding her eyes when he had
gulped down his second cup of coffee
and pushed his chair back from the
table she broke the silence

  wait a minute will she said-for
red lawson was red in virtue of his
complexion rather than by any rights
of christening-i want to speak to
you

  red scowled for a moment it
seemed almost that he might refuse to
be questioned then sullenly he tunifed
toward her tilting his chair against tlie
wall and filling his pipe as though to
make himself as comfortable as possi-
ble during what promised to be an un-
pleasant conference

  fire away since youve got some-
thing on your chest again he re-
marked

  rid-there was the tension of
agony m the girls clear voice-where
ha-v btcen the last two weekst

  didnt i tell you i was goin out

prospectin  the boy did not meet

his sisters eyes

  yes you told me that- and i asked
you then as i ask you now why you
go about prospecting for new mines
when you arent willing to work the
old claim enough even to keep title to
it

ah the old claims no good and

you know it

i know nothing of the kind and no
more do you father had the greatest

confidence in it and since he-since
he died-she choked a little-you
have never been near it ten months
and you have never been near the place
that father believed so much in that he
believed was going to make our for-
tunes that lie died happy thinking it
would provide for us in the end

  it youre going to turn on the wa-
ter-works said red squirming un-
easily im going to get out

  im not going to cry but i am
worried half to death by the way youve
been acting the last six months will
where do you spend your time where
are you prospecting with whom do
you go about  know some of them
and i shudder when i think of your
being their companion the most law-
less the most dissolute-oh will what
has changed you so

   see here crystal said red angrily
you aint been left my guardeen so far
as ive heard of and i wont stand
for any more of this infernal snivclin
an crym an caterwaulin you dont
like my friends-very well as far as
ive noticed they dont trouble you
much with their society

  the girl looked at him without an-
ger but with a heart-breaking misery
more bitter than tears for a minute
or two she did not speak and red a
little ashamed of himself despite his
bravado feigned to be very busy with
his pipe-stem finally she said with a
sigh as though she gave up a struggle

    try well will i ll try not to bother
you any more i see that it does no
good at all it only makes you angry
and puts you farther away from me
but you are breaking my heart when
i see my fathers son going with the
stocky brown



gang that you go with now it almost
kills me you know how ive worked
for you and father ever since i was a
child ten years old you know how
ive tried to make you-such a dear
little fellow you were when you were
six will-never miss your mother and
how  tried to keep fathers house as
she had kept it i know you are doing
wrong i have no belief at all in these
prospecting trips you talk about and
i am afraid afraid-i dont know what
of of all sorts of horrors-that those
men you go with will not only corrupt
you but will get you into actual dan-
ger of the law oh i know they can-
not absolutely ruin you-some time you
will come out from under their influ-
ence arent you fathers and moth-
ers arent you mine but oh t am
so afraid so afraid of what will happen
before you come to your senses again

  the boys face changed from sullen
to half-ashamd and from ashamed to
wholly tender during this tense pas-
sionate address from his sister he
arose and came toward her patting her
shoulder awkwardly

  there there now crys he said
with clumsy attempts to be soothing
dont you take on so your brothers
got a head on his shoulders hes not
going to get into trouble and you must
remember that men look at things dif-
ferent from what women do a fel-
lows got to see a little fun dont you
worry itll all come out right in the
wash and you neednt worry either
about the old mine fin going to find
you a mine-he laughed a slight ex-
cited laugh-which will make that hole
in the ground of fathers look like thirty
cents itll be europe for you thats
what itll be

  far from reassuring her this speech
seemed to fill her with new alarms she
gave a little cry and twisting in her
chair caught at his wrists

  will she begged him in a sort of
agony of affection swear to me that
youre not in with those montevidean
cutthroats swear to me that you
havent been in their camp-lhat you
have nothing to do with their schemes
lhat you-

  red released himself surlily and
stood eying his sister in ugly fashion

 what do you know about any
montevidean gang lie demanded
fiercely whos been filling you up 
oh ive heard rumors-everybodys
heard them but what are they to you
she clung desperately tomttic hope which
she only half possessed what is it to
you youre not in with them-you
are not will robbers murderers
outlaws-oh you are not in with them 
it was a cry of agony at the end her
appeal to him

  of course im not declared red
releasing himself from her fingers
what put such a fool idea in your
head of course im not an besides
you aini got any right that i know of
to talk like that about am one youd
better look to yourself before you begin
callin other people names- he tured
on his heel and went out toward the
corral where his horses were the uiri
watched him through the open dour
with miserable loving eyes

  if only i could believe rou she
said woodenly if only i could believe
you but i cant i cant

  on a pleasant afternoon in oct ber
mr stocky brown was walking down
fifth avenue with miss agatha ram-
say it would require no very expert
physiognomist looking upon the in-
genuous countenance of the voting man
to discover what his state of min  was
in regard to miss ramsay admira-
tion not to call it adoration beamed
from his gray-blue eyes devotion was
in the bending of his stalwart shoulders
toward her

 mr john randolph brown was
known to his intimates-and they num-
bered at least three-quarters of iris ac-
quaintance-by the endearing epithet
of stocky on the law of opposites
for he stood something over six-feet-
one in his stockings and his magnifi-
cent breadth was carried lithely and
easily people turned lo stare at the
handsome couple as they swept down
the populr magazine

the street agatha ramsay was rather
tall for a woman and her graceful
stride kept pace with stockyi c
neath her brown ami violet toque her
pale gold hair caught the autumn sun-
light and wove her an aureole lo
stodkvs reverent eyes this was quite as
it should betagafha whom he was
at that moment escorting from tht cook-
ing-dass at st itartholomewsmission
to which she s nobly so magnificently
devoted two afternoons a week was a
saint no less me would have been
horrified probably to the point of at-
tack had any one informed him lhat
agatha was a verv worldly little fad-
dist and that the lower classes were
merely her tad of the moment

  duncan was telling me last night
remarked the young lady what you
will never tell me-how you charged
up the hill in a perfect shower of bul-
lets-

  duncan was draw ing the long bow
declared stocky it was no more ex-
citing than going out to your uncles
ham tor the eggs

  and how you snatched the flag all
torn as it was from one of the span-
iard- an i how stumbling hack you
tripped upon an american soldier who
seemed dead but who wasnt for
when you fell upon him he gave a
groan and then-oh it was magnifi-
cent magnificent-the girls voice
quivered with excitement either real or
simulate admirably-you lifted him
and bore him back to your own lines

  pretty story  pity it isnt true mut-
tered stocky whose tanned face was
very red

  it was true wasnt it

  oh cut off the trimmings and there
may be something in it hut  say i
don t want to udk about that grand-
stand play i want to talk about some-
thing much more interesting

   i here isnt anything in the world
more interesting than a deed of hero-
ism interrupted agatha flatteringly
softly hut withal a little determinedly

  heroism be-dropped said stocky
 there is nothing in it i tell you it
was merely a dearth of news that day

that made all the war-cry papers take it
up but now lets talk about you

  agatha shot a long whimsical provo-
cative glance at him from her velvety
brown eyes shaded with a perfect
thicket of dark lashes

  you arent going to be stupid are
you  she asked

  thai depends on your definition of
-tupiditv i dare say im going to make
a fool of myself but you see you-
you-you have a way of going to a fel-
lows head

  they were passing the waldorf-as-
toria when stocky reached this point
in the declaration which unwise as he
felt it to be he found crowding to his
lips the afternoon press of vehicles
glittered and sparkled in the middle of
the roadway sumptuously dressed
women smiled from their victorias au-
tomobiles accommodated their pace
more or less to the crowded necessities
of the street the pavements were
thronged with crowds of well-dressed
men and women smiling chatting hur-
rying along apparently the most pros-
perous the most care-free community
in the world somehow agathas
glance sweeping from the tlower-
decked tables visible through the hotel
windows to the magnificent jumble of
equipages in the middle of the road
seemed to be estimating something so
significanfcwas her manner that stockvs
gaze traveled with hers when he had
noted it all-th flowers through the
windows the orchids pinned to the
coats of the women walking or dri-
ving the crush of vehicles-he turned
to lier with a slight look of bewilder-
ment in his honest eyes she was smi-
ling at him with an imp of coquetry in
the corners at her mouth

  its all verv gay and pretty isnt
it  she asked him

  to be sure it is agreed stocky
promptly if youd ever helped to
clean out a reconcentrado camp if youd
ever fed on army rations in a pestilen-
tial swamp youd know how gay and
pretty it all is but whats that got
to do with-with what i was saying-
with you with me-with us he
dropped his voice daringly on the last
stocky brown



word the young man who had won a
days renown in the manner which miss
ramsay had related was no coward
even when it came to making love to a
millionaires daughter

  im afraid it has a lot to do with
me agatha answered with what
seemed a regretful honesty its all
the life i know its the only one ive
been trained for the only one im fit
for we dont need to go on do we
i am showing you myself in this ugly
light only-perhaps im very vain-
only to spare you

  youre an angc declared stocky
with fervor

  no only a mercenary little beast
who has a shrinking from the sight of
pain-and from the experience of pain
she spoke the last words in a lowered
voice

  you mean that you would be hurt
too  stocky ss manner was rapturous
at the admission which he thought he
had surprised he bumped into a pom-
pous old gentleman taking the air and
scarcely heard that personages objur-
gations on his manners

  ah i meant nothing do not press
me be generous agatha spoke al-
most in a whisper or in what did duty
for one in the crowded noisy thorough-
fare

  stocky had begun a word which
sounded suspiciously like the first syl-
lable of darling when he saw agatha
suddenly stiffen suddenly bring her fea-
tures into the conventional lines of gay
indifference and bow toward a han-
som turning the corner into fifth ave-
nue unconsciously he also assumed
the attitude of the ordinary young man
walking down-town with the ordinary
young woman on an ordinary after-
noon in october he straightened and
glanced toward the hansom lifting his
hat meantime a man of forty perhaps
leaning back in the cab returned the
salutation with a broad smile irradia-
ting his large beardless face

  its winterleigh remarked stocky
in an injured tone confound the fel-
low  hes always in the way

  lie doesnt really seem to me to be

so awfully intrusive this time laughed
agatha you wouldnt deny him the
ordinary wayfarers right to the citys
streets would you

   id be glad if he availed himself
more of the privileges of the citys
streets when youre giving me a cup of
tea on the square stocky grumbled
half humorously hes another one of
us isnt he the noble army of miss
ramsays pretenders i mean

   youre a nonsensical boy declared
 miss ramsay youre impulsive head-
 long-leaping at conclusions grasping
 at impossibilities-

   crying for the moon-why dont you
say it

   and now you accuse one of the most
eminent and level-headed person in all
the community of folly equal t- that
which you claim for yourself edward
winterleigh a pretender indeed the
district attorneys office has other things
to think of mr john randolph brown
than idle silly girls

   winterleigh isnt on the job then as
 much as the taxpayers could wish
 laughed stocky or else he suspects
 you of being in league with criminals
 and considers your mothers drawing-
 room a sort of annex to the detective
 department

   well i shall listen to no more of
your jesting declared agatha with de-
cision im going to run in to see
loretta whiting over hereon gramercy
park you-you wont let what we
have been saying make any difference
will you  there was a pleading sweet-
ness in her voice you know even if
i am a worldling i need a friend or
two and what would mamas salon be
if deprived of its latest and most glit-
tering ornament a true hero fresh
snatched from the cuban battle-field
she simply adores duncan now though
a few months aqo he was the least-fa-
vored of her nephews for bringing you
into her radius so on her account-
youll let things be just the same wont
you 

   there was always an admixture of
mockery in her sweetness and her cold-
est utterances were always touched with
something that seemed earnest and ap-


the povular magazine

 pealing this made it difficult for the
 listener who desired to believe her
 wholly one thing or the other to dis-
 cover just what she was stocky d -
 siring to think her half saint and all
 woman an adorable combination of the
 celestial and the charming found
 grounds for the faith that was in him
 in her manner if not in her words

  cant i walk a far as mrs whit-
ings with you  no why not

  ah you didnt understand it isnt
easv for me maybe ive had my little
vision and my little dream loo and i
want to put them immediately away-
perhaps at any rate i wont see any
more of you to-day

  at least ill steer you through this
jam said stocky turning east with
her tell me something-ili i were a
rich fellow-if i were an able fellow
-if i-

  vou a hero wanting to change
places with any one what a foolish
thing

  hero be hanged said stocky an-
grily im talking sense now if i
were a different sort of fellow-dif-
ferently placed-

  oh if wishes were horses beggars
might ride declared miss ramsay im-
patiently

  well im going to see it i cant
rob a stable or do something of that
son threatened stocky so i must
leave you here well the queens
command-good-by

  until to-morrow said agatha soft-
ly as she left him

iii

  i hat mr stocky brow ns young head
was in a whirl upon his shoulders as he
turned back from the cast side of
broadway was do particular criticism
upon the quality of his intellect older
men wiser men more experienced men
than he had found themselves treading
the earth rather dizzily on agatha
ramsays account that young lady
considering her youth had a rather as-
tounding record of-she would not be
coarse enough to call them flirtations-

to her credit had she been born into
another circle than that of wealth there
i- no knowing how wide a swath she
might have cut as ii was she did her
be-t considering the cramping circum-
stances of chaperonage and protection
in which she lived

  but had agatha been mneh less allur-
ing much less intoxicating than nature
and training had made her it would
have been no marvel if stocky brown
had still felt somewhat light-headed
after their encounter stockys best
friends never claimed for him judgment
moderation or any of tin great con-
servative virtues of the world w hat-
ever was wild whatever was daredevil
whatever was hot-headedly whole-
heartedly foolish-that was what was
expected of stocky on all occasions and
seldom did the youth disappoint expec-
tation

  take the matter of his heroism for
example what was stocky brown do-
ing in cuba why was he not where
he should have been in the pleasant
confines of an elm-shaded new england
college on the day when he snatched
his laurels from fame because of
that same hot unreasoning head of his
stocky a junior at the roger williams
university lately arrived at the age of
twenty-two had found the thought of
the wrongs of the cuban too much to
bear in the placid quiet of the class-
rooms the result was that he had been
off to town anl had enlisted at the
earliest possible opportunity

  how his uncle eberfezer who had
disapproved of everything that stocky
had done since the moment he entered
the world-even going so fundamental-
ly far as to disapprove of stockys
choice of a mother-had stormed when
he heard of that enlistment how he
had called high heaven and his inti-
mate friends to witness that he had al-
ways foreseen and foreseeing had al-
ways and in all places foretold what
the result of mrs browns method of
rearing her son would be

  the one folly of my brothers life 
ebenezer brown commission merchant
on west street trader of the old school
slow thrifty exact had wailed he
stocky brown



went south to see about the virginia
eggs-and he comes home with a wife
a wife if you please a hit of thistle-
down it was the only foolish thing i
ever knew my brother john to do she
knew nothing-poor laura-she had
nothing of course after he died and
left me joint guardian with her of the
boy i tried to do mybest for them both
there was something about her-i
dont know what it was-but she sort
of wrapped around you but shed have
no advice about john junior id have
taken him into the business when he
was fourteen-as a boy of course to
run errands and sweep out the place
and begin where my brother and i be-
gan but she would have none of it

  he must go to school he must go
to college he must have his head
crammed full of all kinds of romantic
nonsense and useless notions i asked
her where the money was to come from
she retorted with spirit-she had the
funniest outbreaks of fiery temper for
such a gentle frail little thing-that she
would pay for his education herself if
she had to go out sewing to do it sew-
ing of course  had to give in and
the miserable pittance that they had-
for john my brother had som out his
share of our business to me and had
made some foolish investments with the
money leaving his widow and boy next
to nothing-went very largely for that
boys schooling ill say one thing for
him though wild and harum-scarum as
he was he always loved that little wom-
an and when she died-she died when
he had been at roger williams about
a year and a half-he was nearly
heart-broken t wanted him to come
away then and come right into the
house but he didnt seem to liave any
use for the business and declared he
was going to carry out his mothers
wishes i wonder how much he was
thinking of his mothers wishes when
he cutoff to cuba

  in spite of his grumbling which was
sincere enough mr ebenezer brown
could not restrain some slight avuncu-
lar pride in the achievements of stocky
at the front upon the young mans
much-heralded return he showed his

appreciation of the fair renown he had
bestowed upon the family name by once
more offering him a position in the
west street commission business but
stocky inflamed and inflated by war
and glory was less inclined than ever
toward the concern he had delicate-
ly hinted that if his uncle could see
his way to handing over the whole of
his inheritance now instead of waiting
until he was twenty-five as the terms of
john browns will had commanded he
would appreciate that token of affec-
tion and confidence but that was one
which uncle ebenezer did not feel in-
clined to make he remarked tartly
enough that he would continue to pay
out the income of the principal on the
first day of each quarter asheretofore
he could see nothing in the fact that
stockv had made a spectacular fo  of
himself doing dangerous things in
cuba for believing that he had learned
how to take care of money

  it was as may be perceived from this
history a somewhat poverty-stricken
hero who left miss ramsay on east
twenty-first street and  returned
moodily toward the avenue it was
the first time that the lack of money
had ever seriously oppressed him of
course it was always more or less an-
noying but stocky had had on the
whole unextravagant tastes alw ays pre-
ferring adventure to vice but now it
seemed to him that virtue was in league
with the desire for wealth that it was
with the highest and holiest part of him
that he longed for money

  he had strode disconsolately half-
way up the avenue again when he ran
into duncan ramsay through whom he
had made his acquaintance with
agatha and her mama on his return
from cuba duncan was just about to
turn in to his club and thither he
dragged the not unwilling stocky all
of the ramsay connection indeed all
the ramsay entourage-with the pos-
sible exception of mr edward winter-
leigh-were very dear to stockv in
these days

  in the club-house the first person on
whom stockys eyes alighted was win-
terleigh he nodded somewhat surlily


the povulslr magazine

toward the big man lit felt that here
was an alliance which even though ii
was nut financially splendid was much
more worthy agailia ramsay if win-
ter lei gh did not yet have a vast fortune
he had at least brains lie had position
he had the things which a mere news-
paper-created hero uf a war could never
hope to have

  winterlcigh greeted him cordially
lie was a large man this bulwark of
the district ait meys office ilis broad
face was rattier sallow but not un-
wholesome v so his large body did
out have the effect which so many
large men give of unhealthiness ou
would say that he put on flesh because
he did not trouble to deny himself any
of the flesh-producing goods of life but
that he kept ii in moderate control by
gentlemanly habits of exercise and
grooming beneath his massive fore-
head a pair of very remarkable eyes
looked out upon stocky they were
the kind of eyes you sometimes see in
pictures of medieval italian priests and
potentati --cold immensely calculating
immensely far-seeing passionless in
one sense and yet suggesting invinci-
bility in passion

  stocky received him with a sort of
boyish hostility it was one of stockvs
failings never to be able to disguise his
feelings winterlcigh however disre-
garded his attitude entirely and under
the genial influence of his conversa-
tion to say nothing of whiskies and
sodas the young man began to thaw
out somehow lie scarcely knew how
the talk got around to money every
one in the little group had some anec-
dote to relate of fortunes suddenly
made of the lucky moment securely
grasped stocky listened with eager
eyes winterlcigh studied him at-
tentively a he leaned forward and
drank in these tale of sudden showers
of gold

  it was after winterlcigh had gone
that evans with whom winterlcigh
had been talking when stocky entered
the club addressed the boy half laugh-
ingly

    didnt like to mention it before old
ned he said since lies in the district

attorneys office and is known to be so
keen after the gambling-dens but the
fellow that made the most instantaneous
fortune that i know anything about laid
the foundations one night at jarmcads

i ie was just plain gambling and had
one of those runs of bull luck that hap-
pen every now and then to the green-
horn hed gone into the place with
something like fifty dollars lie came
out with something over four thou-
sand and the next day since for-
tune had resolved to play the bountiful
lady with him he got a chance to go
in on an engineering deal that turned
him in fifty thousand before the end
of the year hes a millionaire now
tisnt a sunday-school story is it

  not exactly agreed stocky the
boys gray eyes were very bright and
glittering  is face was a little flushed
if only some such luck as this could
come to him

  ever been to jarmcads pursued
evans stocky shook his head lts
worth seeing hes really done it up
in great shape if you care for lhat
sort of thing-i dont mean the ex-
citement of the game but the sight of
whats what in the town-ill take you
around some night

 when demanded stock with
startling directness

  oh any time have you anything
on for to-night r stocky shook his
head again then whats the matter
with to-night dine here with me and
well go around there later stock
laughed boisterously as be accepted the
invitation

  with the beautiful insolence of youth
it seemed to him impossible that any en-
terprise ujion which he had set his
heart and whole desire could fail sure-
ly to love agatha ramsay was merely
natural to desire to win her was in-
evitable the desire to make himself
worthy with whatever sort of worthi-
ness cither ie or her family demanded
-this was surely a righteous underta-
king gambling in itself held no horror
for him too many penny-ante games
had been played beneath the roof of
roger williams itself so stocky in-
flamed by his afternoons talk with the
stocky brown



girl inflamed by the tales of sudden
wealth which had followed upon that
talk somewhat inflamed by the before-
dinner and during-dinner and after-
dinner drinks at the club went
joyously forth that night to seek his
fortunes in the most unlikely of all
places-jarmeads lie was able to
feel as righteous as a knight entering a
tourney was it not all for agatha

  had he been less filled with the
vision of her less bent upon making
the vision his own he would have been
able to take an intelligent sightseers
interest in jarmeads which was indeed
well worth attention but as it was the
decorous house on the quiet side street
-a house in nowise different from its
brownstone neighbors-the quiet sump-
tuous interior the decorations the
paneled woodwork the wonderful glass
of the electroliers the paintings the
statuary the soft rugs-all the appur-
tenances that had made jarmeads the
most remarkable place of its kind in the
country and had given its proprietor a
double reputation of king gambler and
connoisseur-all these passed almost
unseen before stockys retina the
fever burned in his veins to win money
it was for that and that alone that he
was there he felt that his star shone
upon him that night he was eager to
begin the little decencies of intercourse
which evans was observing irritated
him with a sense of wasted time rou-
lette-the bettor against the house-
would have been his choice of entertain-
ment but somehow he scarcely knew
how evans had contrived to make him
one of a party of poker-players in one
of the rooms he sat down to the cards
hot and excited he had perhaps fifty
dollars in his pockets he ground his
teeth together in the determination to
multiply them

  i he other men friends of evans
habitues of the place took the situation
easily and indifferently they did not-
seem to notice stockys tension when
the first winnings fell to-him they were
politely oblivious of his unprofessional
jubilation they lost to him with yawns

  the wonder of it all was that they
continued to lo-c there was some

fluctuation in thus play and stocky was
not uniformly the winner but when at
two oclock in tire morning they pushed
their chairs back from the table he had
several hundred dollars in his posses-
sion his eyes were bloodshot with
the strain and the maddening excite-
ment of it his hands shook as he
stuffed bills and coin into his pockets
and he struggled in vain to make his
voice bland and indifferent in acquies-
cing when one of the men said languid-
ly guess ill have to give ou a check
old man

  he went out into the cool of the
night into the deserted streets their
darkness punctuated here ancj there
with white light almost staggering he
had won he had won it was his
fate-he was to be successful in all that
he undertook in every step that should
lead him to the goal of his desires
this paltry four or five hundred dol-
lars wras nothing but an omen nothing
but the declaration that the fates fought
his fight with him w hat was ir those
fellows had said about to-morrow night
and their revenge what was it
evans had aid about trying it out
again to-morrow night  oh he would
give them all the revenge they de-
manded to-morrow night again he
would multiply by ten what he brought
in with him and then to him also
might come that chance of investment
as it did to the man of whom evans
had told

  he walked half of what remained of
the night to weary himself enough for
sleep he must force the blood that
bounded so madly through him to more
orderly coursing he must cease this
wild multiplication of huge sums in his
brain he must get rid of the beckon-
ing glancing vision of agatha and
so he walked miles upon miles through
the deserted streets

  in the morning he was somewhat re-
freshed and swaggered very boldly
down-town the array of a florists
windows caught his eyes he went in
he would send a votive offering to the
goddess who ruledhis destiny orchids
pink and lavender and white in a great
mass-stocky was surprised but not


the pqpular magazine

disturbed to learn tipir price-went
speeding down to washington square

  there were some lilies-of-tlie-vulley
that caught his eye as he turned to
leave the store lie paused demanded
to know their price the florist told
him with the prompt deference due a
young man who had just placed o
large an order stocky placed another
order it was for the cemetery be-
yond the city where his mother lay

  she always loved those little white
bells he told himself chokingly as he
left the place she always loved them
poor little mother

  there was a crush of carriages that
afternoon on the north side of wash-
ington square early as it was in the
season-indeed the season could not be
said to have begun at all-mrs ram-
says little reception for the danish ac-
tress was rather well attended mrs
ramsays affairs were held to be so
different that was mr ramsays
boast

  my dear she was wont to explain
at times  dont care for money i
dont care for family i dont care for
position the only thing i really ask
is that every member of society have
some gift to cheer the ennui of society
as a whole people with brains people
with accomplishments people with
charm even people with merely aston-
ishing beauty-all of these are so much
more worth while than millions or than
any number of lines in the blue book

   hereat the initiated might be for-
given for smiling a little for mrs
ramsay though indeed a lion-collector
of no mean repute was the wifeof a
millionaire and though she hospitably
and with much catholicity of taste in-
vited lo her drawing-room all who could
contribute to its gaiety or its differ-
ence it was shrewdly suspected by the
character-readers that mrs ramsays
patronage of the arts and sciences in
the persons of their impecunious pro-
fessor- would never lead her to lose a
penny

on this particular afternoon as has
been said the polite fiction that nobody

was in town yet was belied by the buzz
and flutter in her drawing-room the
danih actress slim and fair and slight-
ly insolent was proving such an attrac-
tion as mrs ramsay had hoped it
was late when edward winterleigh ap-
peared in the doorway there were a
good many men already present-a po-
lite sprinkling of critics editors and
purtrait-painters giving the tone that
mrs ramsay loved-but the newcomer
immediately dominated the scene it
was not merely the question of bulk
though he loomed large beside the crim-
son velvet curtain there were other
men of incite and of girth in the as-
sembly it was not merely the combi
nation of intellect sensuality and power
in his face though in each of these at-
tributes he excelled all the others in the
room it was not merely that he held
himself with that indefinable air of
knowledge of authority which makes a
man distinguished in any company but
it was the suggestion-vague scarcely
definable yet actually present in the
man-of subtlety perhaps of cruelty
which marked him apart from the others
of the crowd large as he was brotd as
was his face healthily clear as was his
skin he always succeeded in giving the
effect of something medieval something
inquisitorial it was as agatha ram-
say had once told him as though car-
dinal richelieu had come to inhabit
the body of a bon-vivaut or torque-
mada had put on the fleshly covering
of a successful politician

  mrs ramsay greeted him very cor-
dially she liked to think that her salon
approximated those london ones of
which we read where political plots are
hatched and great ladies have a linger
in the governmental pie

  im flattered she told him the
papers implied this afternoon that there
were mysterious activities in your of-
fice and we always associate those with
you since you secured those indictments
against the mutual and the ontario

  oh the papers winterleigh dis-
missed them lightly his eyes were
searching the room when he saw
agatha however he did not permit
them to proclaim the fact
stocky brown

  well arent you planning something
particularly exdtinghis hostess asked

  well yes there is a little party on
which ought to prove interesting but
its a common vulgar affair-nothing
for ladies shell-like ears

  oh our poor ears laughed mrs
ramsay theyre used to everything
in these degenerate days theyve been
inoculated to all sorts of things

  oh but this isnt even interesting
he assured her merely-of course i
rely on your discretion though i imag-
ine that no one in this assemblage is in
league with our opponents-its merely
a gambling matter we want to stamp
it out if we can

  ah  mrs ramsays voice became
vague and uninterested this was
scarcely the juicy morsel of political
gossip for which she had hoped her
eyes turning toward the door by which
stock- brown very alert and trium-
phant in his bearing was just enter-
ing gave winterleigh his dismissal
 ie made his way to agatlia who was
flirting violently in a corner with a
young man from the danish consulate
who had come to pay his respects to a
fellow countryman

  stocky afier he had paid his respects
to his hostess glanced around for
agatha as though bent upon thwart-
ing him mrs ramsay introduced him
tq some girls who insisted upon ex-
claiming and gushing over his cuban
experiences stocky scowling and em-
barrassed parried their-he called it
guff-and feasted his eyes on the
sight of winterleigh in intimate con-
versation with agatha ite was very
much in love and he was something of
a young simpleton still as far as the
reading of social signs went but even
to his englamoured eyes it was evident
that agatha was playing with the dis-
trict attorney

  by the way he interrupted the
young woman who was still gurgling
on about charges and flags and
wounded comrades whos winter-
leigh t dont mean whats his job or
who is he now but where did he come
from  how long has he been in these
parts

  oh havent you ever heard about
that it was very romantic-nothing
of course like leading forlorn hopes or

standing at the cannons mouth-

  ah please let up pleaded stocky
the girl laughed and went on

  why about six years ago some
westerner-a bad man from colorado
or wyoming or some of those places-
came east to spend some money our
new york ways didnt appeal to him
he didnt like the conduct of some of
those who tried to help him spend the
money and eventually there was shoot-
ing unfortunately murder well noth-
ing would do the hasty-tempered gen-
tleman from the west but that a west-
ern lawyer whom he knew should be
his counsel he was really a wealthy
man you see and a great many very
good new york lawyers were perfect-
ly sure that the could prove murder
justifiable in his cae but he scorned
thena all wheres ed winterleigh
he demanded and kept the wires hot
with demands that that gentleman come
and get him out of the hole into which
he had gotten himself well mr win-
terleigh came-and saw and conquered
he opened offices here and about two
years ago got into the district attor-
neys office 

  at that instant winterleigh under a
big laurel-bush wa throwing hack his
head and laughing with that peculiar
vim which only a racy story produces
in such a man agatha whose utter-
ances had provoked this mirth was
looking at him with a little smile of
restrained satisfaction stocky scowled
more than ever he gave a snort ex-
pressive of contempt for the material
which the district attorneys office had
acquired in mr winterleigh and de-
manded abruptly

  any money 

  nothing to speak of said the young
lady calmly a hundred thousand or
so perhaps but nothing in-she smiled
a little maliciously toward the corner
in which agatha was disporting her-
self-nothing in the ramsays class at
all of course

  poor stocky he thought of the
five thousand dollars which would be


 popular magazine

liis entire fortune in tour years an
of the income which he derived from
it now and winterleigh with a hun-
dred thousand or so was not in the
ramsays cl a - then lie thought of
his luck of the night before of the luck
which he was sure would he his to-
night of the pvtuid wa in which lie
was going to force fortune to his own
ends he banished the scowl and buoy-
antly approached agathas corner she
thanked him for his orchids in a way
that set his pulses beating   so
gentle so inti male so underst ling
winterlcigh hearing the thanks looked
a trifle annoyed for the fraction of a
second and agathas sentence may
have been held therefore to do double
execution r-using- one mans jealousy
and anothers hopes

  that night stocky with the obliging
evans once more approached jar-
meads the decorous doors swung
open to them the softly carpeted stairs
noiselessly received their footfalls
stocky heart beat high with hope
there is a tide in the affairs of men
which taken at the full leads on to for-
tune he reminded himself jubilantly
out of his small stock of literary recol-
lections which taken at the full
leads on to fortune to fortune and
agatha

  this night he staked himself against
the house and began to play roulette
so firmly had he persuaded himself of
the assurance of his success that he was
as much perplexed when luck began to
go against him as though he were
working a mathematical proposition
which suddenly began to give absurd
results in spite of tlu accuracy of all
the preliminary steps why his -tar
was in the ascendant-he had told him-
self so the- world was to be his oys-
ter to be opened with a knife of jar-
mead s providing and here luck-he
forgot lhat luck was no fixed quantity
but a very erratic and uncertain lady
indeed-here luck was actually going
against him lie snapped his jaws to-
gether and doggedly went on

   he other men who were betting
upon the turn of the wheel gave mm
very little notice the flushing or the

pallor of young fools was no new mat-
ter for most of them the dealer
monotonously calling the turns of the
play paid no attention to him lie
grew whiter and whiter as luck re-
mained persistently against him his
eyes began to sink hack in his head un-
der the strained intensity of his gaze
his forehead beneath liis fair brown
hair was beaded with cold drops now
he would bet a tiny sura determining
to make no napoleonic plays until once
again destiny played with him instead
of against him but after a few bets
this would pall and he would reckless-
ly place a larger bet challenging luck
as it were but the wheel revolved in-
different to his moods the dealer made
his announcements with quiet and mo-
notony and the other men played with
almost bored familiarity

  by and by-it was w hen he was sta-
king his at ten dollars the last money
of all that which he had von the night
before-it seemed to stocky that his
collar was choking him he tugged
at it and at his cravat and succeeded in
wrenching the linen buttonhole from
the button two or three persons did
look at him then somewhat coily and
disapprovingly one was heard to re-
mark to another as they left the rou-
lette-table where they had stopped
merely for a casual bet and proceeded
toward one of the rooms devoted to
cards that jarmcads was no place for
a boy who didnt know how to behave
himself hang it said the man if
they havent the money to lose why
damn it do they come here do they
mistake jarmeads for a branch of the
charity organization society

  stocky watched the revolution of the
wheel tiiat last time with eyes tairly
starting from their sockets evans
from a doorway lookedat him and
shook his head

  poor beggar that seems to wind
him up i wonder what winterleighs
got it in for him for

  the wheel spun spun more slowly
finally stopped the dt aler unemotion-
ally announced tlie result stocky gave
a hoarse laugh the last cent of his
winnings the last of hi- quarterly al-
stocky brrown



lowance was now gone he would
not be able to buy a scat on the stock
exchange in the morning or a partner-
ship in a brokerage concern or any of
those glorious wild things he had been
planning he turned away from the
table and his place was taken by some
one else

  on the sideboard in the room were
decanters thoughtfully provided by
jarmead for his guests stocky already
staggering from the shock of his loss
made toward the buffet one of the at-
tendants poured him out a stiff drink
of whisky at his request-his own hand
was shaking so that he could not hold
the bottle he had just taken the glass
from the mans hand when there was
a sudden crash of breaking glass all
over the house every one turned
every one jumped the crash was fol-
lowed by another then there was
the sound of wooden panels being
beaten down

  my god a raid cried some one
and pell-mell out of the room the gam-
blers piled making for the stairway
quite uselessly for at the top of the
stairs stood a cordon of policemen at
the same instant through the windows
and doors of the first lloor a score of
uniformed men appeared

   stocky stunned unfamiliar with his
surroundings was still standing by the
sideboard his collar torn the glass of
whisky in his hand he gazed bewil-
dered at the body of policemen they
were accompanied by men in plain
clothes-some detectives some report-
ers some photographers taking
charge of the whole affair was no other
than winterleigh the policemen
rushed from room to room confiscating
the gambling paraphernalia arresting
gamblers the reporters and photog-
raphers were doing their work with
equal efficiency and still stocky stood
staring evans came rushing to him
and whispered to him

  dont give your own name of
course old man nobody ever does

  give my own name where when
demanded stocky stupidly

  at the station explained evans
calmly

  there was a flash-light explosion
the photographers were busy

  at the station stocky was still
dazed

  yes said evans impatiently the
station were all under arrest-dont
you understand  well be hauled over
to the tenderloin station jarmeads
man gaynor will put up bail for us
and itll be all right only dont give
your own name fix your collar old
man whats the matter with you any-
way 

  oh stocky tried to achieve an airy
tone of voice ive just been cleaned
out-thats all

  thats nothing-happens to all of
us now and then youll get it back
again

  and then stocky felt a strong hand
upon his shoulder and he was advised
to come along now and make no row
he followed the advice implicitly as
did all the other gentlemen who were
caught that night at jarmead- at the
police-station he had sufficiently recov-
ered his wits to follow the general ex-
ample and give an absurd name in place
of his own and an address which would
have been some place in the north
river had it been discoverable

  but alas for the hero the next
mornings papers with their flamboyant
accounts of winterleigbs long-planned
raid upon jarmeads long-defiant estab-
lishment had beside last nights photo-
graph of solomon applewhite of 
west twenty-seventh street the dead-
ly parallel of private john randolph
brown hero of the skirmish at man-
zenita there was a six months dif-
erence in date but stocky the gambler
except for the slight matter of the torn
collar was stocky the hero of the
skirmish he saw the papers and knew
that his shame-for it seemed that to
him-would be known that day to his
saint agatha would be known that day
to his guardian his uncle ebenezer he
stuck his hands deep into his empty
pockets and screwed his mouth into a
whistle but there were tears in his
eyes and when the telephone-bell in
his room rang he went laggingly mis-
erably toward it


the vovular magazine

v

  by nightfall of that wretched day
stocky felt with the psalmist that all
the waves had gone over him he was
bruised and buffeted reporter alter
reporter had tried to invade his room to
glean his version of the famous raid
from the district attorneys office
stocky to be sure had ferociously de-
nied himself to all of them but the ir-
ritating jangle of the telephone-bell in
his ears prefatory to the announcement
of their presence had worn on his
nerves he had not been able to deny
himself to i tele ebenezer when that
worthy man looking absurdly like an
animated and vastly chagrined russet
apple had bounced into his room and
had sputtered and sizzled like one of
the fruit which he suggested over a
halloween fire

  was this he had wanted to know his
hand shaking on the damning newspa-
per was this-this disgraceful this out-
rageous this unbelievable story true
was his nephew not only gambling but
gambling at jarmeads the resort of
the spendthrift and the profligate
stocky sullenly admitted that uncle
ebenezers nephew had been so en-
gaged tie did not try to utter any
words of extenuation lie felt that the
worthy commission merchant would
scarcely appreciate the point of view of
a young man who was try ing to lay the
foundations of fortune and of domestic
bliss in jarmeads 

  when uncle ebenezer satisfied or
at any rate assured that none other than
his nephew was the reprobate of the
morning newspaper stories he fell to
abusing stockys mother he could
have told her he declared twenty years
before just what her courses would
lead to it almost seemed that he had
foreseen through every month of
stockys childhood and youth that night
at jarmeads that he could have fore-
told to the hour when winterleighs
great raid was to befall stockys sul-
lenness changed to active rage when the
irascible old man began to transfer the
blame for the nights occurrences from
stockys own broad shoulders to those

of the gentle loving gay little woman
on whose grave the lilies-of-the-valky
were withering that moment and ac-
tive rage had led to a total disruption
between the two as a matter of fact
uncle ebenezer had sought his nephew
with the design of reading him a furi-
ous lecture on ethics and of advancing
him a small portion of his next quarter-
ly allowance but contact with the boy
had curdled the milk of kindness in his
breast and he hail gone out breathing
renunciation of the lad and vowing a
determination not to let him have his
money an hour in advance of the time
when it was due

   h be hanged to you and the money
too stock s final remark had been
it had left ebenezer gaspingly speech-
less at the moment for never before
had his nephew been verbally disre-
spectful of him but stocky had
slammed the door before the old gentle-
man had recovered words and so he
stumped to the elevator and snorted
down in it

  it was late in the afternoon before he
screwed his miserable courage to the
point of calling up agatha ramsay
all day long liis thought had been
what must she think of me what must
she think of me for agatha was
firmly enshrined in his heart as a saint
pity for human folly he admitted might
be one of her saintlike attributes but
it would only be pity tor human folly
decently removed from her own vicinity
and never had he wanted her presence
the charm of her eves the sweetness of
her smile as he did on that bruised day
it seemed to him that if she could he
less a goddess titan he knew her to be
if she could say defer judgment and
for just one hour he tender and healing
he might again face the world and
somehow redeem himself

  at the ramsays there was a pretty
fiction maintained that agatha was
jeune fiuc no depth of knowledge
beaming iti her beautiful eyes no world-
ly wicked mockery dancing about her
mouth no swift subtle understanding
permitted this theory to be overthrown
and as jcuhc fillc it was the law of the
establishment that whoever wished to
stocky b-rown



speak to her upon the telephone must
approach her through her mother con-
sequently after stockys preliminaries
with the servant he was switched to
mrs ramsays boudoir she recog-
nized his voice for all its wobegone
heaviness

  ah is that you mrs ramsay this
is mr brown-mr randolph brown
is there any chance at all of my catch-
ing miss ramsay at home

  oh mr brown mrs ramsays
voice was vivacious and not too un-
friendly stockys heart beat hopefully
im afraid that agatha is not at
home

  oh not at home echoed stocky
dolorously at the other end of the wire
but mrs ramsay was a good general
and it suddenly occurred to her that
here was her opportunity to do some-
thing the necessity of which she had
been lately observing here was her
chance-now that she had used mr
john randolph brown hero of man-
zanita to the fullest possible extent in
her list of attractions-to get rid of
handsome young mr stocky brown
hopelessly ineligible parti before her
foolish daughters zest for emotional
experiences should lead her into some
ridiculous situation so she answered
crisply

  til be quite frank with you mr
brown agatha is at home but i do
not think it wise that she should-that
you and she should have any conversa-
tion to-day the papers-they were
mistaken possibly but the resemblance
between that unfortunate young man
last night and your photograph-

  oh there was no mistake said
stocky valiantly your friend mr
winterleigh-his heart swelled with
hot jealousy as he said the name-
will tell you that it was i myself and
no other but is playing for money
such a black crime stocky knew well
enough the stakes for which bridge was
played at mrs ramsays

  theres no black crime in the whole
catalogue mrs ramsay assured him
mellifluously except getting in the pa-
pers and being poor you mustnt
think me too harsh or worldly but we

mothers must look out for our little
girls even if you were a vanderbilt
and i had proof that you were a fre-
quenter of gambling-places i should
think it wiser to curtail your associa-
tion with agatha as it is-dont think
me unkind-but i really must say that
you had better not try to see her at
present for your own sake you know
too a young girl has her ideal-and
agatha thought of you as a real friend
to-days revelations have hurt her

  so  he had committed the crowning
infamy he had hurt that tender heart
in its tenderest place he had hurt
agatha in her ideals in her trust in
her friendship mrs ramsays pro-
hibition for he understood it well
enough to be that was for the moment
nothing in comparison with this other
horror to have hurt agatha

  he was back at the table again with
his hot tired forehead upon his hands
when without the preliminary telephon-
ing there came a sharp rap on his door
he called out a miserable come in
and edward winterleigh responded to
the summons

  my dear fellow cried the district
attorney i am perfectly overcome to
have gotten you in this hole stocky
bewilderedly took the hand which win-
terleigh extended toward him bewil-
deredly he searched the broad genial
face winterleigh seemed genuinely
concerned

  why you didnt get me into any
hole declared stocky i got myself
there with my infernal folly

  oh of course we are all the orig-
inal causes of our bad times  but i was
the secondary cause of yours and im
sorry for it if i had had an idea that
you were a frequenter of jarmeads i
should certainly have given you warn-
ing-i know i could have trusted you
to that extent weve been leading up
to this raid for weeks you know all
about it-the precinct detectives and of-
ficers were never able to get any evi-
dence against the place that miracu-
lous blindness of their- so i planned
this thing over their heads but if i

had had any idea- he broke off

and then resumed again brown old


the popular magazine

man how am  going tu make it up to
you 

  oh dont bother about me said
stocky still a little bewildered theres
no earthly reason why you should i
was a blithering tool to be in the place
i got caught-and those wretched cuts
of me that flooded the papers after man-
zanita did my business for me have
a drink wont you he hospitably
drew forward bottles and a siphon from
the litter of papers on the desk

  winterleigh watched him as he
dragged himself to the bell to ring for
ice and as he produced a couple of
glasses from the little medicine-chest in
his bathroom any one watching win-
terleigh must have thought that he was
genuinely concerned for the person
whom he watched that he was earnestly
thinking what could he done for him
when stocky came back with the para-
phernalia for the drink winterleigh
leaned back in his chair and addressed
him

  see here brown he said this is
no town for you at present youre too
active for us anyway ten years of
real life-the real life of the army or
the navy or the plains might tone down
your youthful energy to the place where
you belong with the plodding multitude
here why dont you go west  its
the place today the foundation of a for-
tune-a better place than jarmeads
he added with the flicker of a smile it
would get you out of this momentary
unpleasantnes-of course its only
momentary-hut at the same time its
unpleasant it would give- you a
chance

    c  est seems rather an indefinite
post-office address growled stocky un-
interestedly

  into  interlcighs eves bent upon
stockys face thero came an expression
that for the moment suggested cruelty
and bate it was gone before stocky
who had been raising his glass to his
lips had placet that again on the table
beside him

  you mean that you have no west-
ern affiliations which would make it
easy for you t start in out there 
w interleigh asked amiably

   i dont remember a single acquaint-
ance we-t of the alleghenies

   well  came from those pans and
 have enough acquaintances god
knows to stock you if you care to go
think it over brown im genuine-
ly upset about this affair of last night
and its effect upon you id really like
to make it up to you in some way if 
cond  know the west and i know
its the place for a man of your energies
if youl care to o out and look around
you ive had a letter within the week
from an old running-matc of mine out
there who wants a foreman for his
ranch-a fellow who could make some
kind of an impression on ea-tem buy-
ers and who knows the rudiments of
arithmetic and grammar as well as how
to brand a maverick a month or two
would lit you in those accomplishments
which you havent already got what
do you say

   what did he say for the first time
that wretched day a glimmer of life ran
through stocky the west-large
spaces fresh air the open life freedom
-all these things struck some respon-
sive chord in him as they almost in-
variably do in high-spirited youth the
west-the chance to blow out of him
all those soiled and sordid fancies that
were connected with his two nights ex-
periences at jarmeads the chance-
the real chance-to win a fortune and
purified by sunlight and air and whole-
some activities to come back and find
agatha waiting for -urely she liked
him a little and surely if she liked him
she would wait for him but to go
away from her-how could he do that
and all the time winterleigh watched
him out of steady calculating eyes

   its awfully good of you winter-
leigh said stocky finally but after
all however appealing such a prospect
is to me i cant take it up im cleaned
out until next quarter and ive got to
hustle around this town and try to get
something to keep me going until then

  i dont want to discourage you
said winterkigh smiling but this
mornings papers are the worst sort of
a recommendation for a young man
looking for work in this city and
stocky browi



  what kind of work do you mean any-
  way clerkship salesmans job
  thats not the sort of thing for you
  no stocky acknowledged miserably
  to himself those were not the jobs for
  him and it was true that his recent es-
  capade would be no great recommenda-
  tion to a careful employer winter-
  leigh saw the working of his mind
  plainly on his ingenuous face

   as for the money-a swift raising
of stockys chin warned winterleigh
not to go on in exactly the same vein
that he had begun as for the money
if you made up your mind to anything
of the sort that ive been suggesting
there isnt a particle of doubt that that
gnarled old nut of an uncle of yours
would advance you what you need
stockys chin resumed its normal posi-
tion in relation to the rest of his body
and he nodded absently winterleigh
rose and stood beside him placing a
friendly hand upon his shoulder dont
reject me now at any rale he con-
 eluded think it over and let me hear
from you to-morrow or the next day
t dont believe  need any more
i time answered stocky slowly and
i raising honest grateful eyes to his
t friend if you can arrange with my

	uncle i think ill jump at the chance
t and-and-he grew red as he strug-
i gled to express himself-its blamed
i good of you to take the trouble with
 such a blundering young fool as i am
oh thats all right as i said i feel
t myself the secondary cause of your
 troubles suppose i see old mr brown
in the morning and let you know what
he says

   stocky remembering on what terms
  he himself had parted from his uncle
  inclined to the belief that diplomacy
  suggested another mediator with that

	old man than himself so he only said
 again gratefully youre awfully
 good

   when mr edward winterleigh un-

	dertook to accomplish things they were
 apt to be accomplished by the after-
t noon f the following day stocky was in
i receipt of a stilted communication from
i his uncle announcing that he would ad-

	vance from the youths next allowance

       

enough money for a railroad-ticket to
the point mr winterleigh had designa-
ted and for whatever sort of an outfit
would be necessary for the new life
he added still more stiltedly that he
would add to this sum a small one
which he would ask his nephew to ac-
cept as a gift from him even more
precisely he named a day on which lie
would be glad to see his nephew in his
office on west street

  so it was arranged the ramsay
telephone to be sure was obdurate and
mrs ramsay merely assured mr
brown that she would deliver his fare-
wells to her daughter agathas own
voice he did not hear again agathas
own laughing eyes did not cloud at his
farewells furthermore to his plea that
he be allowed to write now and then to
miss ramsay her excellent mother re-
turned a gentle negative however
she assured him she herself would lie
glad to receive communications from
time to time assuring her of his go 
fortune and she added that such com-
munications would undoubtedly be of
interest to her daughter also it was
the utmost concession that stocky
could wring from her but on the wl le
lie was not entirely dissatisfied he had
a vision of himself developing into a
wonderful ietter-writer and he even in-
cluded a camera among the necessities
of his western outfit with a view to il-
lustrated correspondence

vi

  stocky dreams regrets anticipation-
and all was whirling westward his
thoughts as often upon the chances of
the new life toward which he journeved
as toward the lady of his aspirations
he was young and the spirit of ad-
venture in him had not been satiated by
the brief cuban experiences in eager
imagination he saw himself courting all
the excitements of the wide country and
the new career toward which he was
hastening

  he had traveled all night and all day
from chicago and was approximately
nearing his destination a roughly
sketched map of the country had been


the popular magazine

given him by winterleigh and lie con-
sulted this over his dinner the main
line of the westward ho swept west
through the region in the midst of
which the x bar v ranch lay some
sixty or seventy miles to the north of
that property about fifty miles west
of the ranch was flillery junction
whence several short spurs of railroad
radiated into the wilderness one of
these slanting backward east and south
gave the x bar v people a railroad-
station only eighteen miles west their
holdings so that the traveler passed
journeys end-some distance to the
north to he are-while yet on hi- jour-
ney and then doubling obliquely on his
tracks so to speak returned to it
stocky making himself familiar with
the geographical facts consulted his
time-table he would arrive at hiflery
junction at three-twenty a m he
yawned disconsolately at the prospect
there was a train out toward mimosa
his own railroad-station at five in the
morning the schedules were obvious-
ly not arranged for the convenience and
ease of the x bar v people

  when he drew the curtains of his
berth together early that evening he
bade the porter wake him at halt-past
two he wafted a thought back to
agatha and tried to sleep but his rest
was broken though the westward
iio made few stops each one of them
seemed to him hideously jolting and
disturbing through his light slum-
bers he was conscious ot the throbbing
the intense forward vibration of the
train dozing his undertaking appeared
to him in all the hues of folly why
had be not gone into the dairy-commis-
-on business would that have re-
moved him socially any farther from
agatha than he was removed by he-
coming lured man to winterleighs
friend and as for physical distances
he could as butter merchant in new
york at least have walked past the
mellow-tinted -square sunny old house
on jorth washington square why
had winterleigh been so eager to help
him out of the town why-and why
-and why-the questions revolved end-
lessly through his halt dreams

   le must finally have fallen into a

pro founder slumber for it was with a
sense of being dragged back from far
reaches of oblivion that he suddenly
awoke to an incredible fury of noise-
of escaping steam of crackling wood
of shrieks and groans a cry from his 
own lips was dying on the air with all 
those other screams of agony

  in a second or two his brain worked
lie knew that he was lying on the
ground  he could turn bis neck enough
to make out a hissing blare of light
some distance from him on the right-
a burning car he tried to move but
his arms and chest were pinioned un-
der some heavy timber i his discovery
made him realize that he svas in pain
in a sickening dizzying pain from the
great weight upon him he kept on
crying and moaning my god my
god  and tried to shut his ears to the
anguished sounds ascending all about
him in the darkness sometimes a
wave of unconsciousness would pass
over him from the sheer burden that he
bore then he would emerge to knowl-
edge again

  by and by it seemed to him that there 
were vague signs of an orderly activity
in the uproar and horror that there j
was a sense of human presences moving
on helpful errands as this impression
grew stronger and as tlfe light from i
the blazing cars illuminated the scene
so that he caught sight of figures hur-
rying hither and thither he tried to
call but the pinioned chest let through
no sound loud enough to reach the ears
of the workers

  passing out of one of his periods of
sick unconsciousness and coming into
a realization of his position he felt a
presence bending over him the car
was burning less brightly now and he
could only make out a benignant human
form in the darkness but it spoke and
stocky heard a womans voice

  o god o god forgive them he
heard her pray dimlv it sc med to
him that die must think him dying and
that she was uttering some last prayers
as a viaticum for him but he knew
that he was not dying that if he could
only be unpinioned he might even help

others in this ghastly melee to live
i le tried tc tell her so but before he
had formed any words she raised a lan-
tern and swung it above his eyes by
its light her own face was revealed also
he had a moments glimpse of sad pas-
sionately appealing eyes below rough
tawny hair of fine black brows pen-
ciled above the eyes of a straight tense
mouth the somber beautiful gaze met
his full for a second

  all she cried you are con-
scious then he straightened herself
and called to some of the other figures
which the boy had felt moving in the
neighborhood

  here here she called this man
is alive and conscious

  they hurried toward him and as
they came she stooped she had low-
ered the lantern and he no longer saw
her face but he thought he felt the
touch of tender fingers for a moment
on his forehead and he thought he
heard again that prayer o god o
god forgive them but by the time
two men came running toward him she
had slipped away in the gloom she
had seemed in haste at the end for her
skirt caught upon a nail or splinter in
the wreckage which pinned stocky
down ripped as she jerked herself free

  any one alive and conscious here
speak commanded a voice and
stocky by a great effort gave a signal
two men bent over him one an unin-
jured passenger doctor evidently by his
bag the other a train-hand

  id be all right if i could move an-
nounced stocky they fell to work
quickly silently to free him it seemed
an endless process to the boy and the
first moving of the weights upon him
gave him an anguish more intense more
exquisite than the burden itself had
done he shut his teeth tightly upon
the groans that wanted to make their
way into the air when he was free
the man with the bag put a vial to his
lips

  drink that he commanded raising
stockys head with his free arm the
brandy trickled smooth warming re-
vivifying down the boys throat

  there he declared after a moment

im all right now im ready to get
up and help now

  theres plenty to do growled the
uniformed man curse them devils
may they be tortured to all eteruitv in

hell for this may-

  stocky staggering to his feet and
clutching at the doctors arm for -up-
port gasped out why why-what

does this-

  train-wredcers said the doctor
briefly	

  wreckers stocky gasped again

but what for what--

  there was an express-messenger in
the mail-car explained the doctor
briefly taking a supply of gold from
chicago to the bank down there in cop-
per city which is in difficulties it
needed a hundred thousand they say
to keep from going under well-
will go under the messengers dead

the moneys gone-and this-this-

  the devils cried stocky the
mean low devils

  devils i believe you the train-
hand spoke with concentrated rage and
hatred

  did they all get away stockys
voice begged for an assurance that one
at least was lying in the midst of tie
human wreckage his sightless e es
turned to the star-

  every damned son of satan wa
the answer

  and is there no way of apprehend-
ing them has word been sent-

  word do you think they left th--
wires ready for us to send our love to
the home folks at every crossroad-
demanded the train-hand bitterly t mi
halsey is footing it with rob denny to
the next stop-yerkes seven miles
along-to send the word and ten to
one those damned apaches-but
apaches would be gentlemen to them-
will drop the two of them before they
can get to yerkes

  stunned almost as much by this en-
lightenment as he had been by his in-
juries stocky staggered along in the
wake of the two men there were
other figures flitting about that fiekl of
death the air was cold-thin from the
height of the elevation in the dis-


the poipular magazine

tanees the mountains toward which the
land was gradually rising bulked vast
and mysterious in the uiilighted night
nearer the foot-hills gave promise of
refuge to tlic wreckers and roblcrs
terrible was the landscape t the young
man terrible the brooding of the night
terrible the swiftness with which he had
been hurled into unimagincd cruelty and
rapacity

  to kill-to kill tike this and for
money god thit -uch tilings should
be that that woman should he lying
there with her tact pressed downward
into the eartw dead dead with her
mangled arm thrown over her dead
child-that that venerable man should
have passed in agou from the world
that men and women should go halt all
their days-for gold for accursed
money he was no profound philoso-
pher stocky and he was too shod
deringly full of horror to think very
consecutively a he stumbled along with
the others obeying their terse instruc-
tions automatically but the terror and
loathing of the scene mingled somehow
in his mind with the thought of jar-
meads and with the recollection of
agatha smilingly directing his atten-
tion to the expensive luxuries of life-
her necessities money-hideous hor-
rible greed of money

  my last drop of brandys gone said
doctor roth despairingly by and by as
he rose from a survey of the moaning
mangled body of a woman

  i had some in my bag said stocky
were any of the cars saved

  only two were burned answered
the trainman ones lying on her
head over there and a couple  their
sides but two of them are straight

  stocky made his way toward the
track and found that his was one of the
cars which lay on their sides still one
could walk gingerly through it he
picked his steps along through the
broken wood and glas- and found his
section his valise had been ripped
open and his wallet was gone hut the
brandy-flask had not been removed
from its pocket and the liquor grown
so desperately precious had marvelous-
ly escaped spilling at the moment he

was more rejoiced over this than dis-
turbed over the loss of his wallet

  there was one pretty young girl
among the less seriously injured and
the doctor hurried to her with stockys
restoring drops stocky moving some 
board- that had bound her feet and 
helping her to sit up suddenly be-
thought him of the woman who had
be i n his first messenger of salvation
that night something in this girls
straight pretty eyebrows recalled the
finely arched ones over the sad eyes
that had met his for a second

  pv the way he said to doctor
roth wheres your woman assistant

  what woman

  the one who summoned you to me
the one who saw  wasnt gone

  there hasnt been any woman work-
ing except that fine gray-haired
school-teacher from philadelphia who
is helping down there there were
not many women aboard the train
thank god 

  no no said stocky impatiently

i mean the young woman-shes just a
girl why-he looked about him as
though he thought she must be near-
why you must have seen her

  my dear fellow youre dreaming
as soon as we counted up those fit for
service i organized the relief corps 
there was no other woman in it except
the philadelphian

  well im not dreaming persisted
stocky he thought he felt again her
cool touch upon his forehead she
passed a lantern before my eves and
she was saying god forgive them as
though it were a prayer for the dying 
or something of that sort--

  the angel of the death-field com-
mented the doctor no youngster it
was a figment of your imagination 

  stocky said no more at the moment 
he was too busy to waste much time in
words put his native obstinacy com-
batted this dismissal of his tragic-eved
visitant he recalled the sound of her
tearing skirt-he would go back to the
place where he had been pinioned and
would confront this unbeliever with
tangible proof of her presence

  the dawn had come up over the
stocky brown



scene of wreckage the messengers had
returned from yerkes with helpers-
men and wagons and mattresses women
with lint and restoratives-the news of
the disaster had been telegraphed on
and the company was hurrying men
and apparatus to the spot before
stock had an opportunity to go in
search of his evidence lie found it
clinging to a long jagged splinter-a
piece of woolen cloth firm and heavy
in texture tannish olive in color and in
size about as big as his hand tri-
umphantly he showed it to the doctor
one of the railroad employees stand-
ing near-by looked at it

  by gee it is a piece of a womans
dress lie admitted and there were
only ten women aboard and not one of
them had on anything like that i tell
you what it means-it means theres a
woman in that gang of- his lan-
guage trailed oft into the unprintable as
he tried to characterize the robbers

  a woman in the gang that did this
stocky indicated the wreck the impro-
vised hospital-tent all the horror that
the roseate daylight was revealing a
woman y

  sure when theyre bad there aint
nothin too bad for them declared one
philosopher

  oh but this woman-this woman
couldnt have been that sort explained

stocky bewilderedly why she-

he broke off he found himself un-
willing to describe the face he had
seen to give any clue to the vanished
presence of the night why these men
with their absurd suspicionsmight make
it troublesome for her

  later when one of the officials ap-
proached him and asked him for the
piece of doth that nothing which might
be useful in tracing the robbers might
be lost stocky counted his falsehood no
crime when he said that he had dropped
it somewhere

  that woman-never he kept on
telling himself but where was she
where had she disappeared

  not until twelve hours later after
the arrival of trains and supplies he
had begun to feel the inconvenience of
losing a pocketbook in the midst of the

wilderness did he cease to frame plausi-
ble explanations of the girls presence
then his more pressing necessities
claimed his thoughts he surmounted
his difficulties however and by night-
fall found himself at the station which
he had expected to reach in the early
morning a wagon waited for him
from the seat of which a big sluggi-h-
looking sallow man surveyed him

  evenin sir  he observed mr
brown from new york im adams-
seth adams from x bar y ranch
sorry to hear you had an exciting ex-
perience last night w ell youre here
anyhow an that something

  stocky climbed up beside him after
a word or two on his lack of baggage
it had been burned in the wreck lie
explained in spite of the fluency of
mr adams welcome lie felt vaguely
discomfited by the mans look and man-
ner

  after his first speech of welcome
mr adams developed great powers of
taciturnity to stockys bewilderment
he said nothing about winterleigh
merely grunting when the newcomer
mentioned their one common acquaint-
ance and their introducer stockys
conventional assurances that he had left
your old friend winterleigh well
seemed indifferent to mr adams he
was a trifle more interested in the sub-
ject of last night wreck but itwas an
interest displayed rather by a tenser at-
titude of listening than by questioning
stocky describing the outrage awaited
some word of horrified loathing of
vengeful ptirpose none came merely
a more attentive grunt than had greeted
his former efforts at conversation

  are such dastardly crimes common
hereabouts the young man demanded
hotly by and by adams looked at him
from under his overhanging brows

  manners an customs aint as polite
as maybe youre used to he ad-
mitted

  polite echoed stocky but this
is crime-this is murder arson rob-
bery-this is the sort of thing that
makes the massacres of the indians


the vovulak magazine

seem gentle this is by white men
by ones own people do you mean to
say that there is no chance of hunting
clown the despicable cowards

  oh the wells fargo people will do
some huntin they aint goin to let
a hundred thousand dollars get bv them
without some effort to get it back an
the westward ho wont turn the other
cheek cither itll do some pinkerton in
an detectin but if you ak me will
they ever get the gang an will they ever
get the money- think they wont-

  but the people who belong here-
abouts-the people of whom these mur-
derers are neighbors-arent they going
to do anything

  sure the will mr adams voice
seemed to stocky to hold an unctuous
tinge of mockery the sheriff an his
posse w ill be quite busy for a while
ridin about-oh yes therell be a lot of
motion for a while will it get any-
wheres thats another matter ji
course you cant never tell for sure
maybe somebodv catch one of the
gang this time  only know they aint
never done it yet an some of us who
have lived here a long time an know
our ground pretty well some of us find
it more profitable an healthy to mind
our own business than to fly off the
handle there sounded a sinister note
of warning in the words

  they had left the straggling half-
finished settlement with its low-built
adobe buildings its makeshift dwell-
ings patched together of packing-boxes
burlap and tin behind them they
tended downward over a great plateau
across which stocky s unaccustomed
gaze could scarcely discern the road
adams managed the big team like an
old stage-driver and stocky eyed him
admiringly there was a heavy load of
stores for the ranch in the body of the
wagon but the gray pair carried it all
buoyantly gallantly their motion was
inspiriting to the traveler as were the
vast stretches of sky the unencumbered
freedom of the plain the tingling of
thin cool air from the mountains be-
hind them the torn shreds of color re-
flected in the horizon they faced

 he breathed deep his nostrils and

lungs expanding to the splendid new
demand upon them in the invigora-
ting clean drafts some of the horror
of the night before was purged from
him and some of the shame and itain
of that sordid ridiculous episode which
had brought him here he wished that
agatha might be with him drinking in
this wonderful new elixir compounded
of space and air and cohlr he had al-
ways felt in gatha a spirit of adven-
turousness or so he interpreted it at
that stage of his passion no one and
nothing not agatha herself or her own
deeds could have persuaded him that
the excitements she craved were not the
healthful vigorous ones which appealed
to him

  from thoughts of agatha his mind
turned to the girl of last night to the
tragic lantern-lighted face bending
above him to the prayer-a blasphemy
if as the trainmen had intimated she
had had a share in bringing about the
disaster he spoke of her to adams a
little diffidently

  by the way he began there was
one queer thing about last night there
seems to have been a woman mixed up
in it

  adams shot him a swift look-start-
lingly swift from one so heavy and
lethargic in appearance

  a woman how do you mean a
passenger  i- suppose there were sev-
eral of them

  yes poor souls answered stocky
shuddering with the recollection of the
dead mother and child whom he had
seen but this wasnt a passenger-at
leastso they all declared the doctor
he added laughing a little wanted to 
make out that it was just a notion of
my own-a vision of delirium or some- 
thing of that sort but i wasnt deliri- 
ous i only lost myself two or three
times while that accursed weight was
upon me

  do you mean asked adams slowly
that there was a woman there who
wasnt a passenger on the train

  so it seems the railroad people
think she was one of the gang

  one of the gang theyre locoed
do they think that the gang carries a
stocky brown



lot of camp-followers around with it
the gang aint no such fools lie
spoke with conviction

  t dont think she was one of them
either replied stocky hotly but
there was  more finding her than
them afterward

   guess the doctor was right an
you were sort of dreamm in yourpain

  not unless i dreamed a piece of her
drefcs too said stocky somewhat net-
tled she tore it on the timber that
pinned me down as she slipped away-
an ive got it

  did you sec her the question
was sharply put

  as plain as  see you-for a second
she held a lantern over my face and i

saw her by it she was young-

  how youngthe question was
snapped

  oh i cant tell exactly stockr
was surprised at the vehement inter-
est of his driver but young-nine-
teen to twenty-three or four i should
saw

  dark

  no-that is her hair was lightish
-sort of between red and gold and pale
brown i should say and her eyebrows
were black

  adams mopped his forehead and his
tense attitude relaxed

  you mast have been dreamin he
asseverated

  somewhat angry stocky made no
further attempt to persuade the doubter
of the reality of his vision he felt in
the pocket of the coal he had rescued
from his section of overturned car for
the little telltaje piece of cloth then
he fell to musing about the apparition

   hey had stopped at a sort of half-
way house in the midst of the plain
and they anti the horses had eaten then
they were on again through the velvety
darkness pierced with low-hanging
large stars stocky was worn out with
his travels with his excitements and
accidents he felt as though he had
not slept since before that fatal evening
when he had first gone to jarmeads

 he air was adding to his irresistible
desire for sleep he could no longer
talk no longer question no longer care

about last night or any of the nights
before about the shining agatha or
the dark mysterious visitant of the
train disaster all that he wanted was
sleep and be continually fell into
dozes and pitched about on the seat
though he was jerked and jolted lie
could not fight against the overpower-
ing impulse

   finally he hud a dim consciousness
that he was bidden to climb over the
back of the seat to the body of the
wagon that be obeyed as blindly as a
sleep-stricken child obeys the word to
move that wraps were piled about him
and something placed beneath his head
he had a seconds slumberous gratitude
toward the person who had devised this
comfort for him but he didnt know
who the person was and then he knew
nothing more until the baying of dogs
and the cessation of motion simultane-
ously aroused him he saw that they
had drawn up in front of a low wide
rambling building brightly lighted

  here we are announced mr
adams home before two-i said we
could do it

  there was a confused movement of
figures before stocky s sleepy eyes and
in liis ears were the welcoming neigh
of horses from some near-by corral to
their gray comrades and the barking
of the dogs in the doorway of the
low house two women were silhouetted
adams steered him in their direction
and in another moment he found him-
self acknowledging a presentation to
my wife mis adams an	-ler

miss barbara merritt small dark
withered the two seemed to him tight-
locked little boxes of human e-sence
even in the drowsy greeting he gave
them he felt that dust and ashes were
the contents of i he package labeled
mrs adams and that something
more inflammable was still unconsumed
in the package labeled miss barbara
merritt but it was no time or place
for analyses even if these had been na-
tive to stocky s disposition he made
the briefest salutations consistent with
civility and five minutes later was
sound asleep upon a cot in a long bare
dormitory sort of room connected by a
the cpocpulacr magazine



covered passageway with the main body
of the house

  if mr seth adams had manifested
only a slight interest in the present state
of his old friend the militant figure of
the new york district attorneys office
miss barbara merritt stocky found
was inclined to bring the balance of
curiosity to the normal w hen on the
forenoon after his arrival at the ranch-
house he had wakened from a long
deep sleep dressed and made his way
to the front of the building he found
the dark avid-looking woman waiting
for him by daylight she did not seem
so old as she had seemed the night be-
fore and indeed she had some traces of
beauty her eyes except for the dis-
concerting intentness and keenness of
their regard were beautiful-large ex-
pressive and dark her features in their
small miniaturish way were well chis-
eled but all her look declared that
consuming fires burned within her mar-
ring and scarring what might once have
been an attractive appearance

   she explained to stock- that his evi-
dent exhaustion had caused the house-
hold not to arouse him at the usual
hour her brother-in-law was riding
about the place now but would return
b noon to introduce stocky to his new
surroundings and employments mean-
time she was to give him his breakfast
she set it before him gracelessly ttnin-
vitingly and as she moved about she
watched him with intent curiosity

   so you are a-a friend of mr win-
terleigh  she aid at last moistening
her lips a she spoke

   i suppose we are friends since he
has given me this introduction to the
west replied stocky frankly but
up to the time that he made me the
offer we were merely acquaintances

  you met in business again she
moistened her lips and her throat above
the low collar of her brown calico wrap-
per worked

  oh no stocky gave more atten-
tion to hi- eggs than lo the changes in
miss merritts expression lies in the
district attorneys office-a of course
you know i think he said that mr
adams was some sort of distant connec-

tion of his so naturally you know about
his career and i-im nothing much

-as yet

  no smile on miss merritts part in-
dicated that she wished to rebut
stockys modest estimate of himself
indeed it was evident that she had 
interest in it or in anything connected
with him exccpt in so far as he touched
winterleigh

  llow did you come to know him
she demanded

  lie-hejcuew some people i know-

i knew answered stocky he was
miserably aware how he had forfeited
the claim to the ramsays acquaintance

he could not call them his friends now
and he didnt wish to talk them over
with miss barbara merritt who even
through the preoccupations of his appe-
tite impressed him as an uncannily dis-
agreeable young woman

  men or women she pursued dog-
gedly he rai-ed his eyes and surveyed
her with a glance which might have
abashed a less self-absorbed inquisitive-
ness than hers

  i was introduced to him if i remem-
ber aright by mr george duncan he
answered with punctilious exactness i
have met him frequently at the iruse of
mr gordon ramsay i have also met
him in other places and know several
others of his acquaintance and you-
do you know him very well out here
has he been here much lately

  fixing him with her dark eves bar-
bara merritt seemed deaf to his ques-
tioning

  lie has made a great reputation for
himself since he has been in new
york she said half questioning half
affirming stocky nodded gloomily

  oh yes lies done very well for
himself

  what great cases has he had she
had seated herself near the table and
she leaned forward chin upon propped
elbow to drink in thirstily the answer

  well answered stocky with a grim
humordusness he secured evidence
against the most famous gambling-
house in the city for one thing-some-
thing which no one else had ever been
able to do and hes convicted one or j
stocky rown



two murderers-even one or two with
families and money to help them off
and hes indicted the head of a great
corporation hes been cutting quite a
legal swath

  convicting murderers indicting-
thieves i suppose stocky nodded
closing gambling-hells-ed winter-
leigh 

  there was a mixture of exultation
and diabolic mirth about her her dry
lips expanded into a smile which struck
stocky as the most unpleasant he had
ever seen

  of course you must all be very
proud of him out this way he re-
marked politely hes one of ou
isnt he came from this region did
he not

  she nodded and began to clear away
the dishes her veined eyelids over her
dark brooding changeless eyes her
mouth awry in its forbidding smile

  when adams returned to the house
he found stocky refreshed bysleep and
food and forgetful with the wonderful
buoyancy of undefeated youth of the
horrors through which he had so re-
cently passed he was also impatiently
ready to begin his work adams sleep-
ily listened to the boy dilate on his en-
ergy and his desire to employ it he
nodded at the recital

  i reckon well manage to keep you
steppin some while youre with us he
remarked stockys heart sank at the
suggestion of a term put to his stay at
x bar y ranch it would certainly
behoove him to learn a great deal if
there was a chance that after all he
was not established here permanently

  well what will you want me to be
after first sir he asked

  oh youd just better drift about
with the boys for a few days till you
get your bearins said air adams
soothingly ride around with the boys
-learn the lay of the land-get so you
can keep your seat on a horse and can
speak to a herd so as not to stampede
em ride off to a round-up an learn
how its done stockys heart sank
all this did not sound to him like earn-
ing a salary and he wanted to earn a
salary he needed the money in his

business he told himself he tried
tactfully to suggest the same idea to
mr adams

  oh youre on the pay-roll from yes-
terday answered his employer but
youll have to get used to things be-
fore you can be put to anything definite
dont worry-well make it lively for
you when the time comes

  almost immediately things were
made lively for him though apparently
not in the sense mr adams had in-
tended a horse was given to him to
ride and one of the cowboys whose long
length was a match for his lent him
some clothes to take the place of ike
outfit burned in the baggage-car his
first effort at mounting the beast which
he made nonchalantly enough for he
was familiar with horses came near to
being his undoing the little brute had
stood apparently quiet enough until
stocky left foot was in the stirrup
his right leg about to come over the
horses baoj then suddenly lady
gay as the mare was named evident-
ly in recognition of certain of her quali-
ties reared upon her hind legs almost
pitching the young man off by some
good chance he got his other foot in its
stirrup and pressed the spars into the
beast for a second she resumed posi-
tion on all four hoofs then she tried
to throw stocky off over her head ele-
vating her rear legs and almost wallow-
ing with her forehead in the dirt be-
fore her

  the young mans earliest riding-les-
sons had been taken in his mothers old
home when he was scarcely more than
a baby he could keep his seat under
greater difficulties than most riders but
this seesawing of the western pony was
trying to him the next time lady
gay was on all four- he tried to drive
her forward he had lost his hat in the
contest so far and his fair brown hair
was blown about his head like the aure-
ole of a very militant and determined
saint his young mouth was pressed
into a line of determination his gray
eyes shot fires when stocky brown
should learn to bring to the moral prob-
lems of his life the valor and the pluck
he always brought to physical difficul-
the vovvlati magazine

ties lie would be a man in the fullest
sense of the term

  lady gay shot oft with him as though
nothing nearer than the wall of purple
mountains on the west should stop her
bui twenty feet from this glorious -tart
she bucked again and then round and
round a circle of the plain they hew
the cowboys watching cheering advi-
sing stocky deaf to it all solely bent
upon the mastery of the creature under
him in ten minutes she had bucked
and reared twenty limes lie had held
his seat and now at last he was actually
directing her course she was respond-
ing to his lu vl upon the bridle-reins
she broke into a trot and he rode her
two or thn e miles across the plain and
back

  the men congratulated him when he
returned

  she broke larry grimms neck-
but he wasnt sober when she done it
declared one

  really broke his neck demanded
stocky who had dismounted and was
standing by the horses head

  the answer was a realistic cracking
of knuckle-bones by the first speaker

  real a that he retorted it was
under the dai-ies for larry

  whos ridden her since

  she aint been rode since but the
ole man give orders she was to be
brought in for you shes been rangin
since but bud got her about sunup
to- lay i suppose the ole man knowed
you could do it you was in cuba
wasnt you 

  stocky nodded a thoughtful frown
between his brow-s as he stroked the
muzzle of lady gay and then he w-as
suddenly aware that miss barbara mer-
ritt was out by the corral fence her
eager eyes were upon him

  mastered lady gay did you air
brown she said my-but brother
stili will be pleased i reckon he knew
you could do it

  doubtless said stocky shortly still
frowning but lie was an adept in the
cheerful art of putting aside disagree-
able tilings he did not long bother
himseli as to why his new employer had

set him to riding a vicious beast t
was enough for him that he had ridden
her he moved with a certain jaunti-
ness that afternoon he wished that
agatha might have seen that contest
and its outcome

   if stocky reasoned that this victory
over lady gay w as to be the end of his
difficulties  x bar y ranch he rea-
soned without his host and his com
panions he was the most unsuspicious
of human beings he knew that no
one in the country had any grounds of
enmity toward him how could he
then see more than untoward chance
in the succession of accidents that be-
fell him 

   lie had been off on a fenced  spect-
rin g tour when the next serious one hap-
pened he had proved himself a suf-
ficiently apt pupil at such tasks as were
assigned him and after a few weeks he
was promoted to the position of fence
inspector of the great territory over
which the x bar y cattle ranged he
had been absent from headquarters two
or three days sleeping in the open
grubbing on coffee and pork and
hardtack but enjoying life to the full
religiously he thought at every dawn
and sunset of agatha he wished that
she could share the fulness and freedom
of this exhilarating existence with him
but the thought of her even of banish-
ment from her could not be a poignant
grief to him in the midst of the clear
air and the wide spaces and he was
happy with the wholesome unquestion-
ing happiness of clean and active youth
as he rode back toward the ranch-
house at the end of the third day he
was looking forward with considerable
appetite to a change of diet and he was
whistling softly contentedly to himself
when suddenly a bullet grazed his shoul-
der he leaped from his horse with a
yell and looked in the direction whence
the shot had come it had certainly
leen from a low  shedlike shelter about
half a mile from the home group of
buildings stocky made toward it
rending the air with his demands that
the shooter come out and explain him-
self no one responded to the invita-
tion and the shed was deserted when
stocky broun



lie reached it he rode on distrustfully
examining every clump of sage-grass by
the way but nothing appeared and
to his story when he told it on arrival
at the house no one seemed to pay
much attention

  most likely some one thinks he sees
a coyote opined mr adams

  a coyote on horseback in broad day-
light snorted stocky more enraged
by the explanation than by the inci-
dent what kind of circus coyotes do
you have out here

  well youre here without a scratch
aint you demanded his employer

  and no thanks to some fool whos
a blamed sight too ready with his gun
snapped stocky

  this and si townsends determined
effort to engage him in a row of dubi-
ous proportions and outcome rankled in
his mind for a while it was queer
that the most cantankerous man in the
outfit should single out him the inof-
fensive stockv for insult and offense
it was queer that the dangerous horse
the casual bullet any untoward and
unchancy thing should always fall to
him however as adams said here he
was alive and well and to-morrow he
was to ride away from the ranch in
search of a strayed pack of burros
to-night he would write a long letter
to-to mrs ramsay he would have
a chance to mail it on his donkey quest
and it should be a letter which should
paint the plains and the mountains in
delectable colors for a pink and white
and gold slip of a girl

viii

  the traces of the missing burros led
toward the mountains it was toward
evening of his first days search that he
stumbled upon a deserted hill camp it
was not entirely abandoned by human
beings-there were signs of habitation
but the scarred face of the mountain
where the mine tunnels had been driven
was again endeavoring to cover itself
with grass many of the cabins had
fallen to ruin on an old sign before
what had once been a general store
and was now the very monument of

desolation the words silverton post-
office were dimly visible smoke
curled from one or two of the cabins
pitched against the steep background of
rock and spruce growth but there was
no one abroad before any of the doors

  stocky rode toward the nearest cabin
that sent forth the signal of life within
he wished to inquire if the tray pack
had been seen in the neighborhood a
halloo from his horse brought no im-
mediate response lie waited a second
and had just formed his mouth into the
rotundity of the call again when it
seemed to his alert and listening ears
that he heard a smothered sound of
groaning he leaped from his horse
without calling again and pushed open
the crazy door of the cabin

  in the semidarkness of the low earth-
floored almost windowless room he
made out a womans figure stretched
on a lounge and a man seated at its
head with his hand over her mouth an-
other man was at the fireplace-a mere
hole scooped out in the corner of the
room stocky drew his revolver before
he questioned the men

  now you he cried pointing at the
man who had the woman pinioned the
man a mexican sprang to his feet
his companion turned at the same in-
stant the room was so tiny that when
they both stood they were both covered
by the revolver the woman old and
shriveled evidently a half-breed was
mumbling out her fear and her grati-
tude

  they were looking for my money
she wailed mine who have no cent
save what my son gives me-mine lo-
litas who live by charity oh senor
senor tell them i have no money-tell
them to go tell them-

  but stocky had no chance to tell them
anything for with a swift graceful sli-
ding motion they passed under his very
arm and out he started after them
but the cries of the old woman pre-
vented him

   oh senor let them go in mercy let
them go do them  harm or they will
come when you are not here and will
punish the defenseless lolita for their
hurts oh senor do not follow but


the popular magazine

take my thanks and my prayers that
is all  have to give

  she was a repulsive old woman as
she crouched and mumbled--sallow and
shriveled and hawklike with greasy
gray locks about her face a miser
stocky was sure she was but he was
glad enough that his opportune entrance
had driven away the intruders whom
the old woman was now characterizing
in the most forceful terms

  thats all right maam stocky in-
terrupted her fawning thanks glad
to be of use no no i don t want any
reward-thats not what im waiting
for  only happened to be here because
i am on a hunt for a pack of burros
and ive traced them in this direction
have you chanced to see them
branded with the x bar v brand

  x bar v cried the old woman
are you from the x bar v ranch
then you shall be rewarded for what
you have done this day for old lolita
you shall have your reward  i cannot
tell you how-

  its no matter at all about that
maam stocky interrupted her bur-
ros are what im after-not rewards
have you seen them

  lolita had not seen them but as she
explained she had been absent all the
morning searching for good herbs
upon the mountainside perhaps her
neighbor who had been at home all day
might have seen the burros-the burros
of the x bar y ranch x bar y he
should not lose his reward the gracious
senor

  stocky cut short her thanks and
promises again and starter  toward the
neighbors whom -he indicated it was
a cabin up a zigzag path an eighth of
a mile beyond her own to stockys
hello here a tall boy with red hair ap-
peared in the low doorway he sur-
veyed stocky with the interest due to a
strange figure in the wilderness

 youre the new man down at
adams aint you he asked and upon
stockys affirmative reply he invited the
young man into the cabin i le had
heard he said that stocky had been in
the recent train accident lie was quecr-
ly and feverishly interested in it but

there was something about the manner
of his questioning which put stocky on
guard he spoke briefly about the
events of the night and omitted all ref-
erence to the girl who had found him

  lose much r queried the red-haired
youth

  xot much-merely all that i had
answered stocky shortly and that
reminds me to ask you again about

those burros

  by chance mr red lawson was able
to tell stocky that -he had heard of a
stray pack over piero way and stocky
inquiring the direction rode thilher-v
ward he found the stray animals and
went driving them before him back to
the x bar y range he was glad that
his lot was cast at that spot rather than
at the abandoned mining-camp of sil-
verton lie did not care for the inhab-
itants of the latter center as represented
by lolita and mr lawson

  nevertheless the old half-breeds
promises-soon began to seem true the
ugly men of the outfit no longer
picked upon him after he had re-
turned and told his story there were
no more invitations to fight no more
chance bullets if he didnt like lady
gay found her at all unmanageable so
adams said he must have another horse
for his own stocky did not under-
stand the change for a while

  the mystery was deepened by an-
other incident a few days later mac-
cormack one of the older hands was
going to mimosa for supplies anil mail
there was a great writing of letters the
day before seth adams himself a
most laborious penman spent half a
day in the room known as the office
striving with ink and paper stocky
coming up to the corral for something
in the course of the forenoon saw bar-
bara merritt come out with a letter in
her hand she looked about her but
failed to perceive himhalf-hidden as lie
was by a horse she tore the letter
across twice and threw it from her the
wind carried it along scattering the
pieces stocky had sufficient curiosity
and sufficient di-trust of miss merritt
to pursue the fluttering scraps on his
pony he recovered enough of them
stocky brown



to see that they were parts of a letter
from adams to winterleigh why
should the girl so vindictively destroy
what her brother-in-law had worked so
hard to make he fitted the scraps to-
gether as best he could and read

  therell be no more funny business about
him he treated the old woman white
youve got the best reason to know that i
never go back on any one who treats the old
woman white ill guarantee to keep him
here as long as you say but therell be no
more-

just a ragged edge was the rest stocky
pondered greatly but darkly then he
personally delivered into maccormacks
great gauntleted hand a letter bearing
the superscription mrs gordon ram-
say  washington square north new
york then he pondered more upon
the mysteries surrounding him and
finally dismissed them witk an oh
whats the use

ix

  the winter slipped by rather peace-
fully there were snow-storms and bliz-
zards now and then to break the mo-
notony of bright weather there were
occasional fights and noisy misunder-
standings among the big rough force
of the men stockys individual troub-
les as has been said ceased only the
misadventures supplied by nature or by
the unaccustomedness of his work
bothered him now and as for them
by the time spring with its rains came
he felt himself an assured plainsman
and the prospect of losing his job at
the x bar y ranch would no longer
have filled him with dismay had such
a prospect been imminent

  it did bother him somewhat that for-
tune did not follow swiftly upon his ex-
ertions but even at fifty dollars a
month and found stocky saw agatha
glimmering at the end of as long a
perspective as ever her mothers one
or two letters in reply to his ten or
twelve exhaustive descriptions of his
life had had the effect of accentuating
this distance and as stocky never
dreamed of changing in his affections
the prospect troubled him a little

  it was no other than seth adams
himself who gave the young man a sug-
gestion on the subject

  they tell me he observed to
stocky one day that theres copper
over in them hills back of silverton-
up toward the santa lucia peaks

  copper replied stocky listlessly
he was thinking of stocks and bonds
and trying to compute mr gordon
ramsays income per hour

  copper its a good thing to have
it wouldnt do a man no harm to stake
out a claim if he thought there was
anything in it an if lie wanted
money mr adams voice always had
the significance of a slow monotone
but this w as a little slower a little more
uninflected than ever and stocky looked
up

  is it a tip youre giving me he
asked smiling

  i reckon thats wdiat it is there
may not be anything in it i dont say
there is but a little prospectin won t
do no harm

  youre very kind mr adams i ll
act on your suggestion the first time you
can spare me for a few days

  go to-morrow replied adams in-
differently

  that night stocky was moved to re-
mark to big maccormack that he had
totally revised his fir-t impression of
their lethargic dull shrewd employer

  he seems actually kind declared
stocky

  dont you go runnin away with the
notion that seth adams has gut a heart
like a womans as these yere story-
books say he aint hes as sly an
as pison-mean as a rattler hes as
hard as the top of perrys peak an
as cold but you see you hit him on
his one soft side

 i but how

  big maccormack spat far and sol-
emnly before he answered

  because you done a good turn to his
ole half-indian mother

  his mother 

  straight goods that greasy ole
half-breed over silverton way is his
mother an lies got enough indian
in him to make him jes as sure to
the povular magazine



remember a good turn as to remember
a bad one-and you wont hear of many
bail turns seth adams has overlooked
in his progress through this vale of
tears

  the connection w ith winterleigh
then mused stocky hall to himself
must be on the father- side big

  lac gave a loud guffaw

  say thats a good one lie ob-
served stocky innocent of any jocular
intention looked his inquiries

  w hy cxpiamed the cuwboy in an-
swer to the lodk if what they tell me
is true the men-adams an this yere
winterleigh that usd to be hereabouts
-is half-brothers uh huh he nod-
ded affirmation to stockys stare
thats what it is ole man winter-
leigh was one of these englishmen
that know a good thing when they see
it an he come out here an natralized
an took up a claim an prospered an
had an alliance over the left with ole
lolita-ive heard some of the old men
say she was a bird of a young one for
looks well adams was their son-
she contracted a reglar alliance later
with a no-account skunk named adams
an winterleighs boy jes came natural-
ly in for the name

  well when hed done prospered
enough winterleigh gets himself yoked
up by bell book an candle an all other
appurtenances of holy matrimony to
sallie yeast ole man yeast was an
early settler-a tough grizzled ole
party long as a pole an as thin an
kinder sandy-colored an mis yeast
shes cut on somethin the same lines
an complexion they tell me but miss
sallie yeast shes round as a young
partridge an shes meltin dark not
yellow an sailer like her pa an ma
an she has curly black hair an is con-
siderable of a peach she looked more
like a spaniard that was a friend of the
family than like her pa i aint never
seen her or him but thats how they
roll it under the tongue round here-
some of the old ones anyway miss
sallie yeast whoever her own pa was
married ole ed winterleigh when he
had thrun loiita over an your fine
lawyers her son

  fite ugly tale of ancient lawlessness
of blood left stocky musing wintcr-
leighs face arose before him sudden-
ly it had something cruel something
medieval spanish of the old days in its
smooth bland surface

  sickening lut of bounders was his
comment on the story

  they werent no sunday-school kid-
dies for sure agreed uig mac with
ernirc cordiality and indifference

  ilut how does it happen stocky
pursued that winterleigh and adams
are on any sort of friendly terms after
the way the old man winterleigh
treated adams mother

  thats one of the funny parts of the
whole thing when ole man winter-
leigh come to cash in his missus bavin
climbed the golden stair some time pre-
vious what does that there ed win-
terleigh do but get his pa to acknowl-
edge seth adams as a sonan to leave
him some of the property they talk
about it yet-an its full fifteen years
ago-from here to perrys peak an
back again

  it was a noble manly thing to do
stocky commended the act at the same
time edward winterleighs face meas-
ureless calculation behind the remark-
able eyes stood out before him  there
was a smile of suave mockery on the
lips it was a manly thing to do
stockys emphasis increased as though
in answer to the face

  maybe it was opined the easv-go-
ing mr maccormack it sure done
one thing for ed winterleigh-it gave
him a half-indian or quarter-indian he
could count on an thats a handy
thing to have at times

  one effect of this tale true or false
as it might happen to be was to fill
stocky with more repugnance than ever
to the thought of a marriage between
agatha and edward winterleigh to
the jealousy of the ardent lover he
now added other scruples a man of
such ancestry was not fit mate for
agatha lie saw the lurking subtle
cruelty of the alien race of spain in
winterleigh he saw the brutality of his
own kindred race of england de-
scended from some domineering lustful
stocky brown



beast on the one side and with a strain
of intellectual power and remorseless-
ness on the other what sort of man
could he be  what heritage could he
offer the girl  at the moment stocky
saw all his own ancestors in the most
effulgent light of purity and high pur-
pose  nor did he pause to consider the
ethical standards of ir gordon ram-
say multimillionaire by his own exer-
tions-or his own depredations as one
chose to name them

  clearly it behooved him john ran-
dolph brown of unblemished family
of upright forbears to get busy and to
make a fortune which should be worthy
the acceptance of miss agatha ram-
say and the next day he set out for
the mountains with their reported veins
of copper

  less buoyantly he rode than he had
marched into jarmeads on that fatal
night months ago he no longer felt
sure that fate was playing with him
and for him he loved agatha and
wanted her as much as ever though the
immediate allurement of her presence
no longer made his blood bound in his
veins no longer incited him to follies
he rode forth soberly doubtfully not
quite hopelessly perhaps but with a
very temperate hope

  he had found a good place to pitch
his camp-which meant a place to un-
roll his blankets and to drag from his
saddle-bag the tin pan and the tin cof-
fee-pot which had been so small a part
of his western outfit but which had
finally come to be the only features of
it to which he clung there was a flat
rock which would serve him for table
and for windbreak there was a spring
bubbling twenty feet away there was
the odor of pine and juniper and spruce
and there was the sight of the new
spring flowers of the mountains

  copper or no copper stocky told
himself stretching luxuriously after a
banquet of coffee hardtack and bacon
this is a good place he had filled his
pipe and te odor of tobacco mingled
pleasantly in his nostrils with the scent
of the growing things about him he
would rest a while and then he would
do a little prospecting

  while he rested fairly soaked in the
beauty and warmth of the day he heard
a rustling beyond him he leaned upon
his elbow to scan the grasses and low
growths for an adventurous snake but
it was no snake that glided through the
brush a pair of serviceable feet clad
in a pair of serviceable boots moved
along instead following the line of the
borly upward stocky saw a bucket
swinging against a tan cloth skirt still
his eyes traveled upward a leather
jacket was open over a flannel shirt a
soft felt hat was pushed back from a
girls forehead-tawny hair framed a
pale face-stocky sprang to his feet
dropping his pipe the girl started
back-evidently she had not seen him
lying on the ground

  you  cried stocky as she turned
her surprised gaze toward him he
would have known the face anywhere
he thought-the pale olive of it the
intensity of the eyes the even black line
of the brows he was sure that he had
always known her lips would be that
vivid red

  who are you the girl demanded
abruptly his manner had apparently
alarmed her and there was no recogni-
tion in her glance she stood palpably
on guard palpably taken by surprise
startled but not timid

  i-i beg your pardon mumbled
stocky suddenly becoming diplomatic
suppose she were not the visitant of the
night i thought for a moment that
you were some one i had seen befre
i-

  i think not she said coldly though
her brows were drawn together as
though in an effort to recall his face

  tin merely prospecting up here he
added are you-are you camping
near-by he nodded toward her pail

  yes that is im here working my
claim and camping for a few days

  youre not alone gasped the east-
ern-bred stocky

  surely i am why not

  isnt it-dangerous

  she laughed scornfully

  i imagine youre an easterner she
replied its not dangerous there is
no place on the earth i suppose where


the popuulr magazine

women are treated with such respect as
here no one would dream of molest-
ing me even if i were likely to meet
any one which i am not this is the
first time i have ever found any one in
the neighborhood and besides she
added with a certain direct look of
warning i know how to take carc of
myself i have shot since  was four
its a lovely land all right said
stocky nettled at her maimer you
mt excuse me for not knowing it on
sight yoirvc when a mans introduc-
tion to a  ountry is the deliberate
wrecking of his train-when it is mur-
der ar-on r bbery-it takes him a few
days to understand the inhabitants who
perpetrate ami permit such outrages

  he watched her intently as he spoke
all the color left her face she bit
her red lip as though to keep it closed
upon a cry

 you-you were in the yerkes
wreck she faltered

  i was  escaped with my life and
nothing else youll pardon my not
appreciating the true nature of the
populace at once

  she looked at him with wide strained
eyes for a moment then she turned
abruptly away

  i came for some water she said
sharply i must get back

  arent you rather evading an op-
portunity demanded stocky barring
her path she looked up to his bronzed
stern voung face

  let me pass she commanded
before i do will you tell me w hat
you were doing on that field of slaugh-
ter that night  the bucket fell from
her fingers her hand pressed her
side

 i-i- she panted then she

recovered her- if this is ridiculous
she declared

  not ridiculous-terrible disgrace-
ful-anything you please except ridicu-
lous remember how many lost their
lives--remember the sounds you heard
the sights i hat those blazing cars
lighted ridiculous youll have to
revise your words

  you are evidently crazy declared
the girl firmly lifting her bucket once

again i dont know what you are
talking about if you were in the
wreck and suffered i am sorry for you
liut  hope that the experience hasnut

unhinged your brain

  they were right then said stocky
sadly those men who sakl that you
were one ot the gang i never believed
it until now i always thought there
was some explanation but you deny
everything only a guilty person with
a secret to hnle does that they were
right

  i tell you you are insane said the
girl roughly let me pass

  stocky was fumbling in his pocket
she eyed him with something like
alarm pie pulled his hand out in it
was a piece of cloth she panted a lit-
tle in her relief-it was not a pistol he
was not going to play the part of the
avenger he held the scrap against a
fold of her divided skirt

  see he said its the same cloth

  the girl retreated a step ixfore his
look of repugnance then she stood
her ground

  i tell you she said obstinately
that i dont know what you are talk-
ing about as for that cloth-she
shrugged-there are not so many
shops in mimosa that all the ladies
hereabouts are able to have different
goods for their riding-skirts that
piece you have does seem to match
mine-and so will it match any wom-
ans on the range for anything i
know you may be a drummer with a
pocketful of samples

  do you know what i intend to do
demanded stocky  intend to lodge
the information i have against you
in the hands of the authorities youre
a woman-hut if you could forget it
long enough to go out with those mis-
creants on such an errand by the lord

 can forget it long enough to land you
all where you belong

   tell you youre crazy she re-
peated hut the fight had gone out of
licr voice she was frightened that he
could see well it was a good thing
that she should he frightened

  you can turn states evidence and
escape part of your deserts you know
stocky brown



  lie told her a little contemptuously she
  flashed a look of scorn at him

    i swear to you she said that i
 had nothing whatever to do with that-
 that accident i swear it i am well
 known through the region no one
 would believe you i had nothing to
 do with it

   the wells fargo lawyers and the
 westward ho lawyers may not be so
 easy to convince of your innocence as
 your neighbors said stocky

    it was curious to him to observe that
  even while he badgered her the girls
  look expressed more of tragic helpless-
  ness than of hate he recalled her
  words-the prayer she had breathed
  above him he recalled that she had
  summoned aid for him that dreadful
  night he had a moments compunc-
  tions

   see here he said more kindly
 whatever you are i cant believe youre
 as bad as those devils why dont you
 prove that youre straight and level by
 telling the truth-by setting the authori-
 ties in the right direction 

   you persist in thinking me what
 you did at first she-had rallied her
 forces you are crazy i shall waste
 no more time in talking to you let me
 pass

    fie stood aside and watched her as
 she strode with swift sure steps to the
 spring there was elasticity power
 grace in all her motions lie could not
 but like the splendid swing of the young
 shoulders the supple slimness of the
 waist he went back to his blanket and
 picked up his pipe but smoking had
 lost its charm for him

    he did not hear the return of his
 neighbor to her camp he did not look
 for her again indeed he did not want
 to see her so for the next few days
 he dug and splintered rocks and tested
 and finally found something that made
 him do a little hasty surveying and
 stake off a claim posting it with a no-
 tice to all and sundry that this was his

	john randolph browns then he fell
 into a golden sleep and dreamed of
 agathas golden hair in which he was
 congenially employed in placing the
 most expensive stars caught from some
 

heavenly galaxy in the morning he
would ride down to mimosa and record
his claim at the same time would he tell
of his neighbors connection with the
crime which had been his welcome to
the west somehow the idea of such a
necessity made stockys sleep sad it
intruded into his dreams of agatha
instead of stringing starry pearl- and
diamonds for that lovely child of for-
tune he found himself vainly struggling
with ropes that enmeshed the other girl
and her strong tragic face finally blot-
ted out agathas roses and dimples from
his dreams

  suddenly he was awakened by a hand
upon his shoulder some one was sha-
king him calling upon him slowly he
emerged from the dulness of sleep-
slowly and painfull- his chest was
oppressed his nostrils smarting

  wake up oh wake up a voice kept
crying-and it was the same voice
whose o god forgive them had
roused him on another night-wake
up fire-fire-oh are you awake at
last 

  she stood before him there was a
pungent odor through all the night air
there was a pinky glare in the distance
and even near at hand an occasional
far-blown spark fell stocky started
broad-awake

  its a fire she cried a fire wake
up

  it was fire advancing from below
them stocky gazed at her helplessly

  theres only one way to fight it
she cried beat it back with fire here
-where are your shovels-your
matches 

  in an instant beneath her vigorous
command his dazed faculties began
again to work she wanted an earthen
barricade thrown up and a fire started
beyond it lo creep down and meet the
one creeping up they worked to-
gether with the more than human
strength that is given to mortals in des-
perate emergencies they said nothing
-there could be  effort wasted in
mere words and by and by dripping
with toil limp with that and with des-
perate fear they saw the two lines of
fire join well below them and over


the populzr magazine

the blackened surface between their
barricade and the oncoming flames
there was left nothing for flames to
feed upon

  when she saw that they were safe
the girl fell upon her face and sobbed
out oh thank god thank god
stock  shaken beyond his wont put out
his hand and touched her

  there there he said soothingly
and then after a moments awkward
silence be went on weve got to call
this a balance youve saved my life
to-night-theres no come-back  the
wreck account it may trot be right
or just he pursued caught in the
tangles of abstract morality but i cant
help it i cant go back on you now
 may make myself an accomplice but
thatll have to be as it may youve
saved my life w ill you tell me your
name 

  the girls shaking sobs quieted

  crvstal lawson she said toneless-

lv

  well crystal lawson i thank you
its twice youve come at my need even
if you did make one of the occasions
but there-ill never refer to that
again you are to wrap up and lie still
and ill make you some coffee

  he stirred about preparing the drink
when it was ready there was a dim
band of light low in the east

  sit up and drink it he commanded
she obeyed him her eves upon the sil-
very coming of the dawn for a while
neither of them spoke then the sky
began to flush and palpitate with the
secret knowledge of the nearness of the
sun

ix

  it was with a sense of dfcep intimacy
with crystal that stocky took the trail
back to the ranch when the day was
well awake she rode by his side
weary-lookitig silent yet with that
splendid lithe strength in her muscles
which no one night of harassment could
destroy in his simplicity stocky felt
that they were intimate enough for her
to listen to a little plain talk from him

  youve got a brother havent you

he demanded crystal glanced sharply
up  ler answer was a nod

  i know you have-i saw him one
day when i rode through silverton
well cant he work your claim for you
enough to keep title its no fit work
for a girl  dont care how fearless she
is or how chivalrous the country

  crystal seemed listless she made
 answer

  dont you think that what im say-
ing is so stocky urged her

  maybe-i dont know im strong
enough for anything ive always lived
out-of-doors and ive always done
everything i can ride and fish and
shoot like a man  can dig and weed
and plant and  can at least keep hold
of vthe mine it was one of fathers
claims-he had great faith in il but
will-thats my brother-doesnt be-
lieve  it most of the folks who
started out by believing in the streak
back there in the silverton hills gave
up believing some time ago i dare say
will is right-every one else seems to
think so but it was one of- my fa-
thers ideas and-girls are different-
i cant bear to let it go just out of-in-
difference will he has so many other
things now to interest him

  he has no business to let you go
off alone and do that work growled
stocky crystals face flamed

  he knows im all right she re-
torted angrily and he-he knows his
own affairs best

  does be indeed  said stocky satir-
ically he was annoyed at her swift re-
sentment of any criticism of the-lazy
lout stocky called him in his mind
well theres one of his affairs he
doesnt manage to my satisfaction and
thats his sister

  its lucky for linn i guess that he
doesnt try it much ilis sisters an tin-
manageable creature she spoke with
a little ghost of a smile but her eyes
were somber and were fixed on the dis-
tances

  theres one thing  wish youd
promise me said stocky earnestly

  whats that

  let me work your claim for you
ive staked one up there in the hills and
stocky brown



i liave faith in it-ive had a hunch il 
make me rich well im going to work
it for all its worth let me work yours
for you enough to hold the title

  crystal shook her head you dont
understand she said i am not only
safe-i like it i love being up there
away from everything and every-
body

  thank you laughed stocky

  i mean it she said obstinately as
things turned out perhaps i didnt
mind your being there this time so
much but usually i crave the loneliness
the bigness the peace there was a
little passion of desire in her voice and
her eyes were fixed on the blue hori-
zon

  they had reached the desolate aban-
doned silver-mining camp where stocky
had saved old lolita from harm and
had made brief acquaintance with mr
red lawson crystal drew rein and
looked at him

  your trail lies that way she said
nodding toward the road to the x bar
y ranch i cant help being sorry we
met up yonder but since we did im
thankful i was of a little use to you
good-by

  good-by said stocky stupidly he
did not wish to leave her with all his
mysteries unsolved and with the future
solution of them practically barred to
him by her prohibition and their ac-
quaintance but there was something
final in her grave manner

  he sat still upon lady gay while
crystal turned her pony in the direction
of the lonely cabins left on the hill
like the wreckage on a beach after a
storm she wrung his heart somehow
he did not know why or how

  as for her she rode  witli one
thought throbbing through her mind
oh will will why couldnt you have
been like that  why couldnt yrou have
been like that 

  somewhat to her astonishment her
brother was at the cabin when she
reached it-he was there so seldom
lately and to her pitiful joy he was
in a tender mood he was awkward
in expressing gentleness of course but
he helped her from her horse he took

the beast to the corral he came back
and looked at her with some of his old
childish affection in his eyes

  crys he told her suddenly leaning
across the table which she had begun
to set and taking her hand cry--
ill never let you go up to that place
alone again tra a pretty poor stick of
a brother aint   well im going to
turn over a new leaf-you watch me

  youre as good a brother a i want
she cried in a torment of remorse for
the thought with which she had ridden
home and if  have ever criticized
and found fault-oh you know dont
you will that it was all for your own
sake 

  the shadow of a frown passed over
his forehead but it was not for her ap-
parently for he nodded and said i
understand old girl

  she was so happy at the unexpected
admissions at the unhoped-for promise
which she read into his words that she
burst into tears and then she soothed
his alarm at this most un-crystal like
exhibition bv sobbing incoherently its
because im so happy will its because
im so happy

  see here it was mr adams who
addressed red lawson the place wa
the trail leading out of mimosa toward
the plateau which embraced the adam 
ranch the time rwas cloudless mid-
afternoon the air was cool and fresh
and still-as- still as the bn-ad blue slcy
stretched above and around them as
still as stars as snow  heir horses
were going gently anti their hoofs fell
quietly on the dusty road in the wide-
ness and the stillness in the uncom-
panioned vastness of the plain adams
words sounded particularly dear and
portentous red started visibly at them
and resolutely refused to meet adams
challenging eyes

  i said see here mr adams re-
peated the words emphatically

  i aint sufferin from any deefness
red assured him flippantly but a
nervous color burned beneath the tan
and brown of his skin and lie still iaileu
to meet his interlocutors regard


the potpulir magazine

  well im glad to learn as much
because if you aint deef an pay at-
tention youre likely to hear somethin
to your advantage

  im listenin

  youd better look too

  thus commanded rod drew his gaze
reluctantly back from the horizon lie
tried to meet adams stare with ease
but he failed his own eyes wavered
and finally fell lie laughed embar-
rassedly

  spit it out cant you adams he
demanded with a show of bravado

  i can its this adams rode near-
er him and put a hand out to his horses
bridle to give weight to what he was
going to say by the eternal if youre
playin fast an loose with-me itll be
the last game youll play on this here
planet red lawson

  fast an loose with you-what dyou
mean red snarled with an air of re-
sentment

  pete tells me youre against the
hold-up of the new superintendent at
the fiero mines adams snapped the
words out his eyes on the boys chan-
ging face

  i-i am the lad answered uneasily

   you-you are adams mimicked
an when did you set yourself up to
decide what it was advisable or not ad-
visable for the outfit to do or maybe
you have got a private fortune we-dont
know about an caw give us what we
are expectin to take off that young
man 

  ssh  whispered red glancing from
side to side

  theres no sshin  needed theres
no one here but you an me an if
youre on the level theres no need for
whisperin an sneakin an if you aint
-his lips closed ominously

  see here red blustered in his
turn i dont know what call youve
got to come at me like this im
against the fiero game-i think its a
big mistake an ive got the right to
say so aint  

  you aint any longer a free agent
red lawson said adams sternly
thats what i want you to remember
 hats what pete thought you was in

some danger of forget tin you was a
man grown when you came into this
crowd it wasnt no case of kidnapin
an  tell you its a for-better for-
worse union all right till death do
us part-death there was a world
of threat in his manner

  oh you cant frighten me with your
bluffin as lor my bein a grown man

-reds throat worked a little-i was
a fool boy an you know it when you
all got hold of me  wasnt nineteen

  nineteen knows what its about out
here where they aint in the habit of
keepin boys in the nursery until theyre
voters you knew an you was keen
enough for it an now i tell you fair
and square-youre in too deep ever to
get out if thats your game you could
be strung up five times over for what
youve done an damned if i wouldnt
just as soon you would be except for
this-too many good men would have
to swing with you an that get us
down to the gist of the whole matter
youre suspected of a plan to squeal-
to squeal an thats believed to be the
ground of your objection to doin up
the new superintendent on pay-day at
the mine an thats mipposed to be
the secret of your virtue your sudden
new virtue

  the color rose furiously in reds
face damn you i could kill you for
that he swore i tell you no law-
sons a squealer you know your
miserable hide is as safe with me as
my own-you know it im no in-
former

  im glad for your sake to hear you
say so answered adams more pa-
cifically to tell the truth i never
more than half took stock in petes no-
tions but theres only way you can
prove it to the boys-they are sus-
picious youve got to take a lively in-
terest in the doms of next monday
week at the upsilon mines at fiero

  again red lapsed into sullenness his
fire of anger over the suspicions di-
rected toward him burned out he
made no reply

  did you hear adams tone was
suggestive

  oh yes  heard
stocky brown



  have you anything to say

  yes damn it i have cried red
with sudden passion i want to get
clear of the whole business i tell you
im sick of it it aint like what it
seemed before i got dragged into it 
come of decent people  do my folks
were some one back hast im no dirty
greaser-an i aint the son of no fel-
low that couldnt go back home for
fear of the noose or the stripes im
of decent people ive been a fool an
im-im tired of it i tell you-his
voice suddenly broke-i cant sleep
at night for seein a little girl like i
saw her back there tiiat night at yerkes
-a little tiling with light hair all
ground and matted into the flesh of her
forehead an her mothers dead arm
around her-i tell you im sick of it
what do i get out of it you keep out
of sight youve got a business if
you have ten thousand dollars all of a
sudden why youve made a lucky deal
in beeves or your new york friends
been spcculatm for you but if red
lawson appears with ten thousand he
might as well walk up to the sheriff at
once an surrender w hat good does
money buried in the earth do me an
i tell you i cant sleep at night-that
wreck-you never said there would be
wrecks an little children-an  tell you
i come of decent folks

  his voice with all its manifold in-
flections of uncertainty and weakness
had kept rising aud rising

  theres something in what you say
admitted adams reflectively a little
disdainfully maybe you aint cut out
for this by birth an breedin-an
brains he added contemptuously an
it sure is a pity to have money an not
dare to swagger with it an it prob-
ably does hurt when you join in family

prayers with your sister-

  leave my sister out of it com-
manded red he had regained control
of his voice and spoke tersely adams
watching him from under beetling
brows thought it best to regard the
command

  well takin one thing with another
maybe you aint cut flut for the gaue
as were playin it but youre in it

red an in it youve got to stay for a
while anyway i tell you the others
aint goin to let you creep out an turn
states evidence-an escape punish-
ment-

  i told you once- began red

threateningly

  either here or elsewhere finished
adams before either an earthly or
a heavenly tribunal as the judge said at
the hanging of old man muller no
sir not yet a while you know too
much red to get out as long as you
live hereabouts anyway maybe after
the fiero job an one or two others are
done we can let you thin of leavin
these parts you an miss crystal an
meantime red be mighty careful how
you let that there sister of yours sus-
picion anything

  she suspects enough already
gloomed red she knows i cant
travel with the outfit i do for any
good

   well let that be all that she knows
there aint much in that but it would
be just as bad for you if a young lady
of your family turned traitor as if you
did yourself red

   i tell you again cried red angrily
there aint any traitors in the lawson
tribe if cr-if she-my sister-knew
everything shed never give me away -
or those id traveled with poor girl-
that wouldnt be the way shed try to
square it

  well if you care such a whole heap
for the comfort an peace of that young
lady you wont desert until you get the
signal from me it would be mighty
painful for her to have you meet with
any accident-an the tea grounds in my
wifes cup last fright spelt accident for
any one who balked at the fiero game
savvy

  red nodded miserably the liberty
of life which he had once seen in his
chosen course setmed closing around
him like a prison wall he hail intended
if he had intended any tiling a flirtation
with desperate living with picturesque
crime and here he was fettered with a
lifelong alliance his jaws snapped
together in an effort to keep back the
tears-he pitied himself so

  stocky was reading a letter as he
ambled along on his horse it bore the
appearance of a much-read letter al-
though if one could have had the priv-
ilege of examining it he would have
seen it to be of recent date very
thick arid -oft to the touch was the
paper very creamy the hue and deli-
cately scented had the document been
until stockys leather and tobacco had
impregnated it in the dark-blue enamel
across the top it bore an address dear to
the young mans recollection ii was a
letter from agatha

  i wonder if you know how much a girl
loves the thrill of adventure and you are
giving it to me so constantly  am at this
moment enjoying a delightful throb of it
because i am doing something which is
clandestine which is forbidden does it
please you mr john randolph brown to
hac me a transgressoi for your sake are
you conceited enough though the most mod-
vst of cuban heroes to be pleased that my
kind parents ril guardians thought you dan-
gerous enough to forbid you to me so to
speak i am grievously disappointed in mr
brown said dear mama on the day after
mr winterleighs famous raid-by theway
it was quite the making of him politically

	believe nd to think it should have been
the unmaking of you dear mr stocky
brown duncan call- you stocky and i
shall too if  want to well as i was say-
ing mama was grievously disappointed
papa was also disturbed mr winterleigh
v i overcome with compunctions-lie told
me so and therefore i know that he was
everybody was horrified except your friend
a r she-let me whisper you  secret
she would have loved to be there herself that
night-clad in a cloak of invisibility of
course but they forbade her even to re-
member the person who had been there

  then yonr letters to dear mama nice
decorous letters they are-birt i allow myself
to read between the lines if you please
and  range the plain and climb the moun-
tain and brand the maverick and lasso the
wild horse and generally enjoy myself all
the lime of course i am properly going to
dinners and dances and lo st bartholomews
cookmg-school and to mrs vvainwrights
lenten sewing-class and  am playing bridge
and fitting on frocks and flirting with the
same old people in the same old way
lieigh-ho its a tiresome world i live in
and that is why  am tormenting you and
myself by this letter-you because youre a
polite youth my dear mr stocky brown
and youll therefore want to reply when
spoken to by a lady but you cant without
revealing to the ladys forbidding family that

she has disobeyed orders and written to you
which you will never never do so youre
tormented and im tormented because id
like the blueof the horizon for my walls too
and the stars for my roof anil the whole
world to ride a wild pony across instead
of which mother is helping mr wimerleich
receive this afternoon-hes quite the social
rage and its considered a great thing to go
to his chambers-arent we english-and
hear somebody sing or see how commonplace
a great painter can be and ill be there
his rooms are very good-but they seem a
little crowded and stuffy to a person whose
fancy is scouring the prairies

  and do you know why i am really wri-
ting it is to say-dont in the charm and
delight f your new life quite forget us all
sometimes when the wind is particularly
good in your lungs or the sunset particularly
vivid across the west remember one of us at
least and say-say if only that poor
agatha could see this feel this

  and so no more at present from yours
truly	a ramsay

  how stockys heart bad leaped when
the letter had been tossed out of seth
adams mail-bag one day how he
had grasped it w ith eager hands and
then been unwilling to open and read
it there in the midst of the rough crowd
iiow he had carried it out to his fa-
vorite spot on the ranch-a green place
where a bunch of cottonwoods gn w
around a spring and the dry air was
softened and sweetened by their damp
fragrance and with what tantalized
feelings he had read it how he had
palpitated with joy and despair how
lie had felt her near and then had felt
her leagues upon leagues awav iiow
he had been lifted up and cast down
torn with jealousies and healed with
subtle sweet assurances how much
of an enigma she was to him-half
dear and sweet half mocking- deriding
which was she really which did she
mean to be

  to-day as he rode alone on an errand
to one of the farther joints of the
ranch he was reading the epistle again
no number of readings could stale it for
him nor could any number quite make
the elusive creatures intention clear in
his mind had she meant to soothe
with the hint that she cared or to hurt
with the suggestion that she was beset
with attractions all inimical to him and
his foolish hopes he frowned puzzled
stocky brown



  he was riding- along a sort of low
hill two or three miles distant from the
ranch headquarters-a slope the almost
straight side of which was rough with
rocks and cactus growths he was
to tell the truth paying very little at-
tention to his whereabouts or his gen-
eral direction when suddenly the
ground -gave way beneath lady gays
foot the recent rains had washed out
fresh arroyos and made the old trails
when these were along heights treach-
erous he and the horse rolled down
the embankment among the prickly
growths that the sandy soil supported
fortunately he had shaken himself free
of his stirrups at the first and he rolled
down afr lady gay and upon her in-
stead of before and under her when
grasping at the sand and cactus he
finally managed to check his course
and scrambled to his feet his first
thought was for the horse but she
like himself seemed to have escaped
injury

  this bank is made for scrambling
down lady gay he told her not for
scrambling up well have to retrace
our steps about a mile on this level
unless youve got a pair of wings about
you to lift us up right here

  lady gay seemed to disclaim the
wings stocky dug a splinter of thorn
from his arm brushed some sand from
his face and parted the tangle enough
to look out nasty going old girl
he told his mare but well manage it
fie stooped to look at her hoof which
she was holding awkwardly only a
pebble he informed her not a break
good horse suppose you look in my
pocket for something stocky had won
a new nickname at the ranch sugar
brown from the habit he had of send-
ing for loaf sugar whenever a messen-
ger went to mimosa solely for lady
gays benefit

  as the horse nosed into his pocket
the young man straightened himself
again in doing so something peculiar
in the thicket before him attracted his
attention it was formed not alto-
gether by nature he decided some of
the cactuses were dead ones and had
been bent horizontally across a sort of

aperture stocky pulled them away
fie stood at the narrow entrance to a
cave he peered in but could see
nothing the entrance twisted and
there was only a foot or two of black-
ness before him

  my dear lady gay he said youll
not think me rude if i leave you for a
few minutes no t was sure  could
count upon your good nature but the
truth is that this is tlie first cave ive
ever seen outside the illustrations in
my old tom sawyer and im going
exploring talk about adventure

  stooping he crept into the narrow
entrance for a few minutes he paused
to accustom his eyes to the blackness
before them then with outstretched
hands he felt his way along after two
or three turns the space in which he
stood suddenly enlarged instead of
a narrow twisting passage which
threatened at every step lo become im-
passable he was in a wide spacious
underground chamber it was filled
with a faint light from apertures mere
tiny and haphazard and overgrown than
the entrance when he had stood erect
and became used to the gray gloomy
twilight he saw that the cavern had
signs of human occupation in one
corner a piece of stovepipe rose from
a hollowed-out pile of earth and evi-
dently communicated with the outer air
on this rude earthen hearth were
ashes some dirty quilts and blankets
lay about also and a greasy pack of
cards was thrown near the primitive
fireplace scraps of newspaper were
there also and some torn pieces of
handwritten paper a banjo with
broken strings lay in a corner and two
or three empty flasks gave evidence of
one taste of the occupants

  well by jove was stockys total-
ly inadequate comment after a minute
well by jove

  he stooped to pick up some of the
newspaper to see if it gave a clue to
the occupants of the cave it was a
sunday supplement of ancient date con-
taining the account of a highway rob-
bery inwyoming and of the chase of
the robber through three states

  the inhabitants of this homelike


the populah magazine

dwelling like their news spicy and
strong commented the young man lie
stooped to pick up a piece of a torn
letter hoping that it might be more en-
lightening but the first scrap was a
non-committal scrawl in regard to a
horse deal the pages with names upon
them being absent

  i wonder if these duffers pay rent
to adams  stocky asked himself
stooping to collect a few more scraps
i wonder if he knows hes got such a
stronghold on his estate lie glanced
at the next bit of paper it was the
first page of a communication to one
pete from a lady who wrote in the
querulous tone of a wife she wanted
some money and she thought it very
queer lie should be gone so long

  maybe pete has his own reasons for
liking the cave commented stocky
opening another piece of paper jt was
a typewritten sheet upon paper from
which the official heading had been cut
yet somehow the color the texture
seemed dimly familiar to him the
words gave him a start lie read

  the twentieth all lhat you need know
is that i regard him as in my way the
sooner and more unostentatiously lie is re-
moved from it the better i shall be pleased
there are no connections here to make any
troublesome inquiries so any accident-
mind it must be an accident-will do cy-
clone stray bullet drunken bullys row-only
nothing directly traceable to you thats
more for your own sake than mine

  the ycrkes affair was not a success it
must never be repeated how often must i
repeat that the bloody is unplcasing and
unnecessary and to put two big corpora-
tions on your track-the express company
and the railroad will hound you till your dy-
ing day as i have always maintained it is
infinitely cheaper to corrupt a trusted of-
ficial and make him do the work for you
a bribed baggage-agent in the car with the
express-messengcr would have done in this
case of course i know that you expected to
accomplish the other result also by the acci-
dent if you had known him by sight of
course you could have-that is probably you
could have as it was the whole thing is
particularly messy

  for heavens sake do try to do something
with that she-devil of a sis-

  and there the letter ended so far as
stocky was concerned no other scfrap
of paper was in the neat typewriting
no other had any bearing  the sub-

ject of the ycrkes disaster stocky
his head in a whirl searched and
searched eventually he found-his
own wallet emptied of everything which
had made it valuable but no more of
the incriminating document did he dis-
cover

  so he liad by the merest chance
fallen upon an apparent headquarters of
the gang responsible for the train dis-
aster and who could tell for what out-
rages besides he could lead the sheriff
here-he could carry those telltale pages
to the officers of the law he put all his
accidental scraps of evidence together
-his purse the torn letters the vari-
ous signs of occupation in the cave
perhaps an intelligence trained in the
detection of crime could make some-
thing of all these and the piece of
cloth his hand which was busy in
gathering the bits together dropped
loosely at his side until he knew lhat
 evidence would implicate that girl
until he was sure of that did he desire
to give it all into some ones else hands 
he saw her so courageous so alone-
he couldnt believe the testimony of
his senses against her eyes against her
stubborn silence even  he would do
nothing to bring that girl into danger

  he made a little cache of hisown for
the things he had found-there was 
use in throwing everything over even
though he did not care to be rash to
implicate crystal lawson in all these
horrors then he made his careful way
back to the daylight again on the
whole he would not tell mr seth
adams of the tenants he had stocky
had more than a moment of sick convic-
tion that the information might be no
news at all to mr adams he began
lo put two and two together and the
resulting sum was too terrible for his
simple mind fully to believe but he
would he on his guard for future con-
firmation of his suspicions

  he led lady gay out of the pitfall
back to the low level ground ihe clear
sunny day he took a long deep breath
of the warm air already he could
scarcely believe that he had just left
the lair of criminals it was like a
dream a tormenting vivid nightmare
stocky rown



   lets forget it lady gay lie said
to the mare maybe some old wizard
is hypnotizing me into all sorts of
fancies perhaps the whole thing is a
delusion and i shall wake up by and by
at home in new york with a nice little
note from mrs ramsay asking me to
dinner oh lady gay if only  could
be back there where theres no killing
and no highway robbing but only sun-
shine and dimples and blue eyes and
orchids and cabs and candle-lighted
tables and- he drew agathas let-
ter out again and kissed it

  well what i want to know what i
demand to know declared barbara
merritt about six weeks later is when
you mean to obey orders

   like everything else around her her
voice wa tense-tight strained with
emotion it was harsh too and it al-
ways affected stocky disagreeably
stocky had gone thus far through the
world nursing the agreeable delusion
that women were although appearances
were sometimes against them sweet
soft tender-hearted creatures made for
mans reverent protection barbara
merritt by her silences by her words
by her looks by the aura that sur-
rounded her did more to combat that
pleasant theory than all his other ex-
periences put together

  when therefore entering a lean-to
shed outside the ranch-house kitchen he
heard her taking her brother-in-law to
task he paused irresolute he wanted
to go in and to attend to his business
but he hated barbara merritfs pres-
ence to such a degree that it seemed
almost easier to postpone his own af-
fairs while he debated calling him-
self a fool for his uncertainty adams
voice replied

   see here said the womans brother-
in-law youre goin on too much late-
ly dont forget who owns this ranch
nn who runs it

   es but who runs him demanded
the woman impertinently

  whoever runs him he runs this
place an all connected with it himself

   i tell you if you dont obey your
chiefs orders she retorted insolently
i shall

   are you fool enough to think that
you can regain lost ground with him
that way the man taunted her dont
you know that hes done with you
through with you these five years an
more 

  she gave a low cry of rage more
like that of ananimal than a human
and there was a sound as though she
was hurling herself upon adams
stock- heard a growled you would
would you you damned wildcat and
the sound of an overturned chair he
hesitated no longer but slipped quickly
out of the house adams and the
woman could both take care of them-
selves he knew and he wished no more
intimate part in the intricacies and ugly
entanglements of the x bar y house-
hold

   his first buoyant delight in the nov-
elty of existence out west in the fresh-
ness and freedom of it had given place
to an anxious sense that he was sur-
rounded by mysteries stocky liked the
sunshine and the wide open reaches of
life not its dark and devious paths he
felt himself incompetent to walk among
these that takes a fellow with
brains he told himself quite humbly
counting himself a man of considerable
brawn and some breeding rather than
an intellectual human being and grad-
ually he had come to dislike his en-
vironment because of the subtle impres-
sion that nothing in it was what it
seemed to be adams with his tac-
iturnity and his angers alternating with
his incomprehensible likes and dislikes
with his loyalty to the old woman of
silverton with his absences his isola-
tion in a community where the rule
was hospitality and good-fellowship
airs adams in whom the passionate
nature of her sister seemed to have
simmered down to an intense capacity
for silence and a constant expectation
of calamity-stocky had never seen
any creature whose eyes so continually
expressed a controlled horror of what
she was about to hear barbara merritt
with volcanoes of hate and desire and




the <PO<PULA<1<> magazine

all uncomfortable emotions burning be-
hind her jjale face pete the chosen ally
of adams an out-and-out drunkard
bully gambler and thug controlled only
by the big raneh-owners quiet eyes
mysterious comings and goings under
the cover of night mysterious mes-
sages mysterious silences a mysteri-
ous lack of bona-fide work about the
great ranch-all these things had finally
gotten on the boys nerves to an extent
that made him despise himself im
like a woman with nothing at all to
think about except my symptoms lie
told himself

  as the pretense that he was to be
trained for a definite position in the
cattle business which was mr adams
ostensible calling gradually declined
stocky had more and more time to him-
self lie was free to come and go
pretty much as he pleased-a freedom
which he found rather degrading he
didnt like draw ing wages for anything
so intangible as his services had proved
to be however he made the best of
the situation the time which was so
lavishly accorded him he spent largely
in working his claim among the hills
eut he lost no opportunity of learning
some tiling about the cattle business and
having great physical aptness as well as
strength he was soon as good a cow-
boy as the outfit boasted

  after leaving the ranch-house during
the ugly quarrel between adams and
the merritt woman stocky went frown-
ingly over to the corral and led out
lady gay he would ride out to a
boundary fence which was reported in
bail condition--he would do something
to efface the impression of what he had
overheard

    im going to get out of this as soon
as i can he told himself its a
crooked joint im afraid if winter-
leigh were here hed have to do a little
raiding on his brothers place lord
but hed be a fine one out here id
back him to discover the retreat of the
outlaws in a month and to disband them
or have them swinging in another-hes
got brains that man but im going to
get quit of this it only that claim up
in the hills would pan out well or if

only dig mac would do as he said when
he cleared out of here lie said the
place was too much for him though he

wasnt oversqueamish-and that hed
write me from texas when he got back
there about the chances there theres
one thing certain this is no place for
me-its crooked and queer

  he was saddling his mare and was
stooping to tighten the surcingle when
there was a sudden rush behind him
and a sharp pain went stinging through
his left shoulder as he jerked back-
ward the weapon that had been thrust
into him was drawn out he had in
turning his neck a confused impression
of barbara merritts face inflamed and
transfigured with hatred and the joy of
hatred gratified and then just as he
was about to receive the dagger again
in his chest the vision widened to i-
clude the white tragic face of her sif-
ter barbaras arm was held tightly
stocky straightened himself and looked
at the pair barbara snarled like a
thwarted animal but she could not
shake off the older womans iron grip
in a second the younger subsided into
a half-frightened sobbingnd whimper-
ing

  if you will go up to the house we
will stanch that wound-i dont think
its serious said mrs adams

   i think ill have soiie explanation
first said stocky mrs adams pale
face grew more strained and weary
she still held her sister lirmiy

   oh shes like this sometimes -lie
replied its-a sort of craze i sup-
pose but she wont have another out-
break in a year probably theres no
danger

  flow do  know that why
shouldnt i give her in charge de-
manded the young man

  youre bleeding quite freely mr
brown interruptedthe older woman
please go to the house and let us
stanch the llow or you will be weak and
sore to-morrow then you can talk as
much as you want to and ask seth any-
thing you sec fit to ask him  tell you
she shes not responsible and i
can promise you that she wont try any-
thing of the sort again
stocky brown



    the shaking weeping creature by her
 side said nothing stocky followed mrs
 adams advice and went up to the
 house he was angry but rather at
 the mental confusion which filled him
 at the attack upon him than at the at-
 tack itself w hat on earth had he ever

	done to barbara merritt that she should
 single him out for such an outbreak
 he would demand some adequate reply
 from adams-and then there pulsed
 confusedly through his recollection
 fragments of the talk he had overheard
 between the woman and her brother-in-
 law-talk of the chief of orders unful-
 filled

   oh hang it cried stocky impa-
 tiently in a few more minutes i shall
 think im the missing heir to a vast for-
 tune and that these are the miscreants
 hired by the usurper of my rights to
 put me out of the way im getting
 dotty thats whats the matter with me
 ive always thought the woman was
 half crazy anyway and she turns out
 to be a little more so than i had fancied
 -and there you are 

   nevertheless after he had listened
 to adams halting dry explanation of
 his sister-in-laws periodical outbursts
 of homicidal mania which adams
 maintained was mixed with religious
 mania and which he also declared to
 be of the most infrequent recurrence
 stocky decided that the air of the ranch
 was too charged with mystery to be
 easy breathing for him at the time he
 would go up to his claim he said for
 a few days and give miss merritt a
 chance to recover from her attack un-
 disturbed and unexcited by his pres-
  cncc adams wiped his forehead with
 a look of relief when stocky reached
 this determination

           -	 xiii

   riding out of silverton he over-
 took crystal lawson she turned such
 a changed face upon him uiat he scarce-
 ly knew it joy irradiated it as the
 spring irradiates the countryside he
 suddenly realized that she was meant by-
 nature to be like this-her eyes deep
 wells of happiness her red lips full and

curving with smiles her whole pres-
ence expressive of ample content per-
haps after all she was not the visitant
of the wreck certainly nothing could
be more untilce that tragic vision than
this cheerful-nay this more than
cheerful this happy-young girl she
greeted him with utter friendliness

  im disobeying orders she said
gaily im going up to the mine camp
alone

  no youre not stocky laughed
back at her his youth responding joy-
ously to the challenge of her vivacity
im going along

  oh that doesnt count said crys-
tal

  im glad you consider me such an
intimate friend he smiled she
blushed a little under the olive of her
skin stockys heart opened wide to
take her in  she was not the lady of his
adoration of course she was not all
ivory and gold and turquoise and
preciousness but she was like nuts and
berries and fruit juices and warm
spice-fragrant days she wasnt to be
loved and desired and fought for-by
him at any rate-but what a corking
friend what a bully comrade she would
make agatha must know her some
day he beamed upon her in the pleas-
ure of having really discovered her as
it were

  but why are you disobeying or-
ders he asked

  oh im feeling so-so energetic i
suppose it is that i cant stay still in
silverton any longer i want to get up
there and feel that theres no one to
breathe up the air but me-you shant
count i want a big wide space to feel
happy in

  as happy as all that arent you
going to tell me about it stocky had
a sentimental streak in him and he was
hoping that she would announce that
she was engaged so much joy for a
smaller event would be a waste he
thought

  as happy as all that she answered
but not what you think mr mind-
reader tts nothing but-but my
brother i speak to you about him
she added with a note of gravity in her


the vovular magazine

full low tones that had for stocky
something the note of a thrush be-
cause you spoke to me about him you
criticized him-do you remember

   didnt mean to be rude and im-
pertinent answered stocky contritely

  its all right-now she assured
him for w ill wasnt-hadnt been-
doing- just what  thought was right
me had worried me-you see i feel like
a mother to him although im only a
year older but lies changed lies
given up goin about with the people i
disliked ut is going to work tlie
claim--were so happy together and
now ill tell you the real reason im
telling von anything about it

  another real reason-more than
that you wanted me to know how mis-
taken my impertinent remarks were

  another besides im willing to
admit now that your remarks were not
entirely groundless the other is-
will says you-you gave him a dis-
gust he calls it-for the crowd hed
been going about with

  what-me said stocky ungram-
matically and embarrassedly

  yes her eyes dwelt upon him
with deep gladness and friendliness it
seems that one day when-when he
hadnt been behaving very well-you
rode up it was the day you had just
driven those mexicans away from lo-
litas cabin and somehow he says
you looked so different from the gang
hed been with  you werent ashamed
to be polite you werent afraid oh
what can i say about it all  anyway
will saw you-and i suppose the time
was ripe  and he began to consider that
dad had been your sort-not the sort
that some of his friends are and he
began to think that hed rather be in
your class-

  see here cried stocky dont go
on miss crystal you cover me with
confusion if your brother knew- what
a poor kind of stick i am hed prefer
black pete and the rest any time i
hadnt anything to do with any change
that there may be in him--hang it im
not a sundaj-school-book hero as you
say yourself the time was ripe he felt
like coming back where he belonged

thats all but-he leaned down so
as to look more closely into her glow-
ing face--tm mighty glad for your

sake and for his

  she smiled unspoken thanks at him
and they rode en in pleasant silence for
a while that all her thoughts were
still upon her brother there was no
question for when she finally spoke it
was of him

  hes coming up to-morrow she
said and good replied stocky em-
phatically

  he came tip on the morrow and when
stocky after a days work on his claim
went over to the cabin on the lawson
claim he was struck by the change in
the boys looks yet through all the
improvement there was still a strain
of diffidence of nervousness-almost of
fear reel showed no lack of devotion
to his sister it was pretty to see them
together-pretty and a iittle sad for
stocky who yearned to have some one
of his own to whom he could be de-
voted as they sat around after sup-
per the men puffing at their pipes the
girl sitting contentedly doing nothing
on a low stool before the fire her el-
bows on her knees her chin in her
palms red remarked i wish i had my
banjo

  do you play it was stocky of
course who asked

  oh i strum a little 

  whats become of your banjo
will asked his sister idly

  lost it one time i waoff camp-
ing said red

  stocky half laughed i could guide
you i think to the remainsol one 

  where asked red carelessly
knocking the ashes from his pipe

  stocky had never mentioned the cave
to any one but now he could see no t
indiscretion in it-was he not among j
friends at last that had been one of 
the torments of his position ever since
be had come to the west-he had had
no friend no one to whom he could
say what he pleased without fear of i
misconstruction

  in a robbers cave he answered
with mock impressment in his voice
rarn fll r n ri m

stocky brown



crystal sal suddenly erect and tense
red spilled some tobaccg

    a robbers cave repeated crystal

   yon mean just a cave dont you 
amended red when he had rammed the
tobacco into the bowl

   no-i mean a robbers cave then
stocky began to wish lhat he had not
spoken so gaily after all he had seen
crystals face on the night of the train-
robbery he had a piece of her torn
dress-why had he been such a bloom-
ing idiot as to lead the conversation
back to that uncomfortable unex-
i plained event

   where red jerked the word out
yes where demanded crystal
 tensely

   stocky started to tell them with
much circumlocution in order to gain
time while he was still floundering
i a long- cry as of some wild beast
i quavered through the air crystal and

 	her brother sat straighter in the fire-
 lit twilight of the cabin stocky
 thought he saw her eyes turned with a

	look of heart-broken reproach upon
red as for him it was plain that he
heard the cry with alarm

whats that a wildcat asked
stocky glad of interruption the cry
rose and fell again it seemed very
near it seemed almost to pass along
the very mountain above the cabin
red arose and went toward the door

 will said crystal pleadingly

just a minute sis it sounds so
i near i guess ill sec if i can get a shot
eat it

   the darkness outside engulfed him
c the cry sounded again and from very
i near at hand it was returned

   by jove there must be a perfect
- carnival of wildcats at our very door

 	declared stocky rising to follow young
 f lawrson do you mean to tell me
  that you wouldnt have been fright-

	ened hearing sounds like that if you
f had been up here alone

   dont go out said crystal vvood-

	enly oh dont you know that was
t no real cat it-it wav a signal

    she buried her face in her hands for
  a second when she raised it and
  arose to light the lamp there was no

   trace of the merry girl who had rid-
den with him the day before it was
the gray-faced woman of former days
-miserable burdened helpless hope-
less stocky understanding only that
one of reds old associates had sum-
moned him with a signal-call that red
had responded and that reds sister
after what stocky shrewdly suspected
to be the habit of woman was making
a tragedy over it took his leave as
soon as red reentered the cabin the
next day when he went over to see his
neighbors it was closed and empty

   somehow all the pleasure of the ex-
pedition was gone for die young man
here too as well as at the ranch were
mysteries and darknesses truly he
had fallen upon times trying for an
easy-going open-hearted plain-speak-
ing young man he would go down to
the ranch again and demand some ex-
planation of things he would tell
adams what he knew of the cave he
would put the authorities on the track
of the desperadoes he would do some-
thing to clear up the obscurities in
which he moved

   he dawdled several days over his re-
 turn trip however there mingled so
 much distaste with his impatience that
 the one almost neutralized the other if
 he wanted to enter with a bold demand
 for truth the complexities of the situa-
 tion still he did not want to become
 by knowledge any more of a part of
 all the ugliness than he already was
 if he felt it a duty to tell what he
 knew to spur the jaded activity of the
 county official- he had a dread of what
 the investigations might reveal about
 the girl whom he had called friend
 and comrade in his thoughts as they
 rode up the mountain slopes together
 altogether the situation was a langle
 stocky jogged home by the roundabout
 route of mimosa perhaps there would
 be a letter from uncle ephraim offer-
 ing him a modest fortune or from
 mr ramsay offering him a partner-
 ship or news that the millennium had
 been formally proclaimed and inaug-
 urated or some equally likely way of
 escape from this accursed country

   but there was not there was a let-


the vopuljlr magazine

ter for him directed in agathas hand-
writing-a thick creamy envelope the
sight of which made his pulses bound
and there was a newspaper carefully
directed in her mothers fine neat
script stocky indifferently thrust the
latter into his saddle-bag--he supposed
it would contain an account of mrs
ramsays tnusfeale for this celebrity or
dinner for that for the lion-hunting
hostess had no objection to spreading
the news of her captures broadcast
even in the most unlikely places-and
he felt that that could wait but
agathas letter his fingers twitched to
open only  must get out of the
sun-baked ugly little town it was not
a fit place to open such a letter

  on the plain headed homeward with
nothing apparently between him and
the sky he drew it from his pocket and
broke it open his heart beat his eyes
were suffused the folded sheet was
bare on the last page-it was not then
a long letter he fumbled with it
nervously only a line on the first
page under the blue enamel of the date
rewarded him

  forgive me forgive tne

  it seemed to stocky that the whole
world reeled the blur before in-
creased he tried to brush it away-it
must have deceived him must have
made him read falsely ite stared hard
again at the paper there was no mis-
taking the words agathas hand had
not trembled every curve was jully
made and rounded the whole grace-
ful decided distinguished handwriting
of the girl was perfect what did it
mean  what did she mean 

  he had ridden ten miles or more the
beat of the horses hoofs going through
his brain like presses that printed there
in uneffaceable characters the words
forgive me forgive me sudden-
ly he remembered the other part of his
mail i re dragged the paper out of the
saddle-bag he tore the wrapping off
he knew that somewhere within its
pages he would find a clue to agathas
note her mother had supplied that

  it was on the first page that he
found it under sufficiently large head-

lines if the gordon wealth had not
commanded importance to oust from
the first place of the paper politics and
crime and scandal the winterleigh
prominence would have merited it the
shining member of the district attor-
neys office was to marry the daughter
of mr and mrs gordon ramsay-
that was the great news of the day
along with a mine disaster and a black
hand outrage and a presidential fore-
cast the engagement was announced
the date of the marriage was not set-
some time in the coming autumn would
probably see the happy pair united

  and now at last stocky knew how
stronger than reason hope had been
he rode on with a sgre hot heart by
and by of course he began to make
excuses for agatha she had told him
plainly that his suit was hopeless on ac-
count of his lack of money and posi-
tion she had given him tender marks
of affection-and remembering them
now in the moment of his bitterness
the young man was in torment for them
again-because she was young and
simple there was no pledge between
them-she had always told him she was
only playing only he had thought
in his doting hopefulness that she
played chiefly in saying that and
he had known there was no hope-and
her father and mother had doubtless

coerced her into this- and then

the recollection of agathas laughing
provocative face lifted to winterieighs
amused appreciative sensuous one
smote him and lie put his hand quickly
to his eyes to shut out the vision

  he rode hard and he roefe long and
by the time he finally turned his horses
head toward the ranch he had regained
control of himself he felt ages older
-he felt that he had done with youth
almost he had determined upon his
course it was clear to him that
agatha was scourged with remorse
over those afternoons for them she
begged his forgiveness-ah his forget-
fulness  well he would-forgive
he had nothing to forgive but he
would put the thought of her away
he would go back home-into the but-
ter business or any other he would


stocky brown



  get out of the accursed tangle of life
  here and then he would go home and
  efface himself his path and the win-
  terleighs need never cross and by
  and by he would be an old man and it
  would not matter at all

    he was greeted with more than usual
  cordiality-almost with relief when he
  arrived at the ranch barbara merritt
  cowed and white came up to him and
  made him a little speech of painful
  apology there were times she said
  when she was impelled to do terrible
  things-though she herself did not re-
  member them but her sister told her
  so and her sister had told her that
  lately she had tried to hurt him would
  he-but stocky cut her short with kind
  words and indeed with a sense of
  pity poor girl poor afflicted soul he
  turned from her subdued and white
  face to her brother-in-law who stood
  near and watched her during the cere-
  mony

so our friend winterleigh said
stocky striving to speak lightly and
anxious to reduce his news to the level
 of the commonplace as soon as possible
so our friend winterleigh is going to
i be married

   what the scream came not
from adams but from barbara mer-
ritt stocky swung swiftly around
again to find the meek piteous crea-
 ture of the moment before transformed
f her face which he never remembered
 to have seen with color before was
 aflame her eyes were two malignant
i lightnings her bpdy was tense

i poised as though for a spring

    i said began stocky while adams
 caught his sister-in-law by the shoulder
 and shook her fiercely crying do
 you want another taste of the cellar
t fool

let me go she yelled let me
 go she wrenched herself free

 now let me hear him say it again-

	the lie she glared at stocky
 stocky looked from one to the other
 bewildered and angry

i dont understand all this ke said
 shortly i must ask you mr adams
not to lay hands on that woman again
while i am here if she is a violent

lunatic she should be put under proper
restraint not left to chance subduing
by brutality and if she is not theres

less excuse for roughness-

  again again say it again if you
dare barbara merritt stood under
his very chin

  i said that mr adams friend mr
edward winterleigh was engaged to
be married to a young ladv in new
york

  say that its a lie a damnable lie
she reached up as if to threaten him
when her sister glided in from one of
the rooms beyond summoned by
adams she laid a hand on barbaras
arm and spoke to her in some dialect
unknown to stocky apparently indian
the girl subsided and leaned her face
against her sisters shoulder finally
she answered in the same uncouth
tongue in which she had been ad-
dressed

  she says interrupted mrs adams
looking sadly at stocky for me to ask
you if you are sure it is true or if it
is only a newspaper report and what
the young ladys name is

  i have reason to believe it is true
said stocky the line of agathas letter
printed upon his brain and the
young lady is-is amiss ramsay
barbara merritt raised her face from
her sisters shoulder and looked at
stocky with a concentrated rage and
hatred he had never seen equaled then
she faced her brother-in-law

  he shall never marry her she de-
clared hissingly never-and you may
tell him so she added to adams her
manner curiously enough for all the
absurdity of her assertion was com-
posed and sane adams briefly bade
her be satisfied with the folly she had
already committed and not add to it
she looked at him vindictively

  i will see you all swinging from the
gallows before he shall marry her she
declared robbers and murderers-
fools do you think that t shall sub-
mit to this when i can stop it you
get a retraction from him of this thing
-ride and telegraph to him-or before
god i will hang you all

  she is clean locoed declared


the poipulacr magazine

 adams wearily and yet with a little
 anxiety in his weariness lie motioned
 to his wife to take ihe woman away
 then he went on explaining to stocky
 you see how it is of course win-
 terleigh-oh its ten or twelve years
 since he made love to this fool an
 she thinks she has a claim on him ever
 since lately these crazy spells have
 been cornin on her an they come olt-
 enest by some connection with him it
 was that you were a friend of his that
 turned her against you-an you know
 the rest

   i know both more and less than i
 desire to know mr adams replied
 stocky with some dignity there are
 many things which have happened since
 my arrival here which i dont under-
 stand what i do understand i dont
 like

   were rough i grant you that said
 adams conciliatingly we havent
 much polish-an i have to keep a
 crazy woman  my place because shes
 my wifes sister an my wife cant bear
 to have her taken away-even if any
 judge would commit her the day she
 went up for examination shed prob-
 ably be as sane as you an me but i
 ask you mr brown except that our
 western ways aint iiko your eastern
 ones an that my sister-in-law is a she-
 devil have you anything to complain
 of

   stocky felt bafiled of what could
 he complain for which he could prove
 adams in any way responsible cer-
 tainly he had been well treated by the
 man personally he hesitated feeling
 a little foolish

   because went on the ranchman
 pursuing his advantage id like to
 know what it is an to remedy it
 you come here mr brown recom-
 mended to me by a friend-bah
 why not say the truth which i know
 that you know  you come here rec-
 ommended to me by my half-brother a
 man whom  have every reason in the
 world to oblige youve been here no
 time at all before you save my old
  mother from harm why should i not
 do my best for you in every way
 when havent i done my best for you

  stocky apparently convicted of un-
graciousness and ingratitude turned

red

  you make me out a pretty poor
sort mr adams but you must re-
member that i had an unfortunate in-
troduction to your country an that
my recent experience with your sister-
in-law was-well disconcerting at
lexist but from you i think i have
nothing to complain of i hope youll
overlook my growling

  it was natural enough i suppose
said adams achieving the effect of a
dignified forgiveness the two parted
stocky going out to the quarters of the
men as he went he pondered the
threats of barbara merritt he did not
feel sure at that moment that she was
merely insane and if she were not
what did she mean by including ed-
ward winterleigh in her threats

robbers-murderers- the words

rang in his ears and there mas the
cave-and the directions from someone
authority to some other as to the man-
agement of crimes the conduct of train-
robberies the assassination of selected
victims suppose that letter had been

to adams  suppose-- his mind

groped fascinated horrified among
appalling possibilities and gradually
the blue bond paper with its neat type-
writing formed itself again before his
eyes where had he seen that paper

  pshaw cried stocky leaping to
his feet im in a nightmare ill
soon be as crazy as that vixen of a
merritt woman

  and then a pain crossfed his heart
that made him forget for the moment
everything but it he clenched his
hands against it how could he bear
it yet he must-must bear it quiet-
ly bravely-for had not she written
forgive me-forgive me

xiv

  it was a troubled sleep that stocky
had when finally he succeeded in sleep-
ing at all from one restless dis-
turbed dream he passed to another it
was not his own experiences which
colored them-they seemed pure fan-
stocky

tasies unconnected with anything he
had ever known lie fell off high cliffs
and caught himself half-way down
their scarred faces railroadrains de-
moniac and uncontrolled pursued him
and no turning or twisting on his part
could defeat their determination to
grind him to pieces he was all alone
in regions of arctic ice he was set to
walk unimaginable distances over hot
shifting sands all sorts of tortures
he endured one after another

    finally it seemtd to him that he
  awoke from his various nightmares
  and that some one was calling him
  outside the familiar bunking-room it
  seemed that he arose in answer to the
  call-it was like agathas voice was
  his confused impression as he seemed to
  stumble to the door drawing on some
  clothes as he went outside that de-
  lusion seemed to vanish the night
  was flooded with silver and all the
  sheds and outhouses and the ranch-
  house itself stood very distinct in the
  moonlight and it seemed to him that
  barbara merritt was waiting for him
  and that it was perfectly natural that
  he should follow her and do her bid-
  ding she wanted her own horse he
  thought which was not in the corral
  but had been running the range for 
  c week i must have him she seemed
  to tell stocky for i have a long ride
  that i must make before morning and
  i couldnt trust any other horse to
   take me

then he thought that she showed him
 her wrists red and scarred with ropes
i and her arms blackened with cruel
pressure that is how he subdues
n me she whispered with a ghost of a
j smile but to-night i have escaped
him then stocky seemed to himself
 to pity her greatly but she dismissed
his pity lightly

    t suppose i am a little crazy she
t told him at any rate lie could easily
prove it so if any one should hear of
 the cellar and the ropes you see it is
i crazy for any one to brood as i do
j and to wait as i have waited and to
 hate and to love like me but now get
i me my horse for i am quite sane now
and stocky thought that he mounted

      

brown	

his own horse and rode to the top  f a
high mesa behind the house and easily
found barbara merritts horse and
brought him down and finally watched
her ride noiselessly away in the moon-
light

  in this dream which he thought in-
deed no dream but the true condition
of affairs he had just come into the
long room svith its bunks again and
hail just thrown himself upon hi- bed
when he was taken roughly by the
shoulder he opened his eyes he
was on the bed half-dressed and the
morning light was flooding the room
adams stood over him-shaking him to
rouse him

  get out of this quickly he said
i want to see you at the house and
left him

  but when stocky reached the house
adams was not there mrs adams
met him inscrutable and gray

  mr adams said stocky briefly
he wanted to see me 

  no he didnt replied mr adams
wife woodenly lie wanted to get rid
of you so that he could see the other
men without your bearin anything

	stock looked at her blankly she
returned his stare out of dead eyes

  i mean what i say she said in her
monotone he wanted to warn the
others

  warn the others

  warn em to scatter-to hide

  mrs adams i dont know why you
arc speaking to me like this said
stocky gaining some possession of him-
self i dont know what you mean
i dont know just what i mean my-
self cried the woman her toneless-
ness suddenly taking on the poignancy
of anguish im talkin because  cant
help it barbaras gone my sisters
gone mr brown-an my husband
knows shes gone to tell what she
knows an he wants the men to scatter
to hide an he dont know yet how
she got away he had her tied down
in the cellar

  how did she get away asked
stocky dully what in the dreadful
night was fact and what was dream
airs adams answered dully  did
d

the tpoepullcr magazine

it t couldnt bear for her to suffer
no more

  ami what has she gone to tell and
where

  oh you must know last night
when she called us what she did he
was speakhi gods truth and now
shes gone to tell she can lead them
to the cave as straight as a die-an
there theyd find enough to show who
held up the fiero superintendent las
week-that was while you was away
workin your claim maybe you didnt
know ah theyd find other things
maybe-an seth is warnin them to
scatter he says weve all gut to scat-
ter but i aint goin i aint goin till
my poor sister comes home again

  adams swung noisily into the room

  ah here you are brown he said
with the assumption of bluff heartiness
ive just been called off to dealing
on business for a few days ive been
assignin the boys their jobs i want
you to stay at headquarters an tend
things here-

  sec here adams said stocky
quietly theres no use bluffing me

  adams cast a swift glance of sus-
picion on his wife she nodded

  ive told him she said unemotion-
ally adams scowled blackly then
his forehead cleared

  well youm have to know it sooner
or later he observed philosophically
a little sooner doesnt make any dif-
ference its true we run one or two
little side enterprises-an my precious
sister-in-law we suppose has gone to
tell what she thinks she knows about
them but therell be no proof-
therell be no proofs an shes well
known for a lunatic itll be unpleas-
ant for a while thats all now will
you stay here an keep house or will
you ride with us

   tell me one thing answered
stocky amazed at the mans openness
and at his own quiet acceptance of the
situation was this gang implicated
in that traiu-wreck when i came out-
the yerkes wreck

  a bricklike flush mounted adams
broad sallow face

  we didnt know- you then he said
admitting and apologizing all in one
breath stocky waved the apology
aide  fis personal animosity was
singularly inert lifeless it was no
crime against himself that he thought
of

  if there is any chance that that out-
rage will be discovered he said i
mean if there are any evidences left-

i cannot stay here with mrs adams

there is something else  must do

and let me tell you this you-

the words of insult died upon his lips
as he looked at the man he had been
too buffeted by experiences and emo-
tion to feel anything very strongly
now even rage and disgust and horror
the futility of strong language seemed
to him its strangest characteristic
let me tell you this mr adams he
amended his remark i hope with all
the strength i am capable of that you
will get exactly what you deserve

  adams eyed him evilly for a second
i suppose you realize that youre pret-
ty much in my power he said itll
pay you to keep a civil tongue in your
head it wouldnt trouble my con-
science a mite to put you where youd
never wag it again civil or uncivil

  stocky fingered the revolver in his
pocket but with the same sense of
deep indifference to his own safety and
adams anger as he had toward every-
thing else

  i know you wouldnt lie awake
nights over killing me he answered
but id trv to arrange that you
shouldnt lie awake at all i dont in-
tend to die without a fight-and you
mightnt come out first in that

  adams hand in his pistol-pocket
clicked something stocky watched
him warily poised as though for a
spring at the first intimation of move-
ment on adams part

  damn it cried the ranchman
suddenly drawing his hands empty
from his pocket what do i want to 
waste time bandyin words writh you
here have i nothin else to do you 
did me a good turn cnce when you t
didnt know it ive tried to pay you
for it-i have paid you for it we
stocky brown

 i

stand square as far as that goes but
all the same i cant feel it that were
square enough for me to kill you
get out of here-you saved my mother
from harm  ill never attack you unless
its to save my own life from you

  maybe i owe you somethin for
that said stocky but i dont feel the
debt i say it again-i hope you get
whats coming to you 

  he opened the door and passed out
he ran to the corral already it was
empty of horses except two or three
he saddled one in haste and mounted
all that he desired was to reach crys-
tal lawson and warn her that judg-
ment was about to fall on the wreck-
ers i f she belonged to them let her
escape if it was only her brother-
let him escape stocky was too im-
mensely weary with all that he had
endured to reflect upon his own in-
consistencies

  the day advanced from the fresh-
ness of early dawn to the steady mid-
morning heat he rode and rode up
from the high plateau into the hills
never in all his young life had he
known such a weight of deadness as
oppressed him now the action of his
mind was purely mechanical wonder
horror sadness fear had no place in
his tired heart he only knew that he
was riding to crystal lawson to warn
her that danger threatened her his
very curiosity as to how she was ini-
plicated in all this lawlessness was lan-
guid

  on and on the hot sun beating upon
him noon approached on and on
the young flowers and grasses of the
higher regions crushed beneath his
horses hoofs on and on the sweet-
ness of the junipers and the scrubby
aromatic growths in his nostrils and
by and by he came near the bleak little
settlement lhat sprawled upon the rough
mountainside here were larger ever-
greens more shade the sense of great-
er coolness as he wound his way up
beyond the abandoned mine tunnels the
rotted and rusty machinery the ruins
of workmens houses and company of-
fices lie had the first living sensation
he had had that lav before crystals

door a rough little platform had been
built-a primitive piazza on it there
was a long chair with a bright turkey-
red cushion making a note of color a
mexican olla swung from the rude
roof it all indicated one thng which
he understood even in the dulled stte
of his mind the instinct of the home-
maker had been bom in crystal or in
her brother-in them both perhaps it
was all one with the glad light in her
eyes the day they had ridden together
it was one with her joy-an outward
and visible sign of an inward happi-
ness

  as he rode up crystal herself came
out upon the porch she had a flower-
pot in her hand and she set it upon the
platforms rail at one side then she
stood back and surveyed the effect h r
head inclined to one side then came
the sound of his horses hoofs and she
turned

  he leaned from his saddle not dis-
mounting he had the vague sense
that he had man errands much busi-
ness that here was but a part of his
duty done it was with difficulty that
he remembered why he had come to
her

  what is the matter she cried at
once you are sick-you are hurt-
what is it

  im all right said stocky thickly
i came to tell you something you-
you must go away he swayed upon
the saddle

  get down she cried jumping
down the step and running to his side
get down youre sick

  he slid down his saddle and she put
a strong arm abefut him and led him
up to the turkey-red cushioned chair
lie was conscious as though from a
great distance of being gently tender-
ly pushed back and pillowed he felt
the reviving touch of cool water on his
head the reviving trickle of brandy
down his throat then lie came back
from the immeasurable distances where
his spirit had dwelt all the morning
while his body had done so many
things

  i seem to have gone pretty queer
he said then he reflected i guess


the popular magazine

i forgot my breakfast wait a min-
ute as crystal at this confession
darted into the house wait a min-
ute he essayed to rise and follow
her but liis limbs were weighted down
with weakness and weariness he sank
again into the chair in a second it
seemed she was back again and was
holding a cup with raw egg to his
mouth

  swallow them she commanded
and he obeyed after a minute life
seemed to flow once more through him

  i didnt conic here for nursing he
told her but to warn you i he of-
ficers will be on the track of the parties
who caused the yerkes wreck this
morning if you- wanted you to
know

  she stared at him out of horror-
stricken eves

  then it was that she cried

  what was that

  black pete was here a while ago
looking for my brother will was on
the way to mimosa fflen if they come
from there-but maybe black pete
overtook him he had only been gone
half an hour

  it was your brother then-and you
were following him said stocky slow-
ly following him to try to dissuade

him-- but she had run into the

house again in a few minutes she
came around on her horse

  i shall bless you for this till my dy-
ing day -he cried passionately i
must leave you-you must rest-

  i am going with you cried stocky

  no no no why should you mix
up in these wretched things and you
are half dead now and your horse is
spent good-by god bless you

  she was off while stocky was still
standing on the porch clutching the rail
to keep from swaying

  he went into the little house it
was very neat and it had a certain
rough grace of its own with its big
navajo blankets its antlers over the
fireplace its branches of pine in jars
of indian pottery its unexpected rough
shelves for books ft was a very dif-
ferent cabin from its neighbors be-

speaking a different standard of life

and to think that such utter ruin and
disaster threatened it

  in the pantry he found more eggs
and milk conscientiously he ate and
drank and gradually strength came
back to him and with it a more living
emotion concerning those events in the
midst of which he stood when at
last he was ready to take one of the
horses from the little enclosure back of
the house and to put up his own jaded
mare he was himself again and him-
self cursing the time-destroying col-
lapse which had cost him an hour
whatever happened he wanted to be
with crystal lawson when the supreme
moment of trial came to her lie
mounted the new horse and struck off
down the trail toward mimosa

  it was easy following her trail for a
while and then suddenly he was
aware that the prints before him no
longer tended toward mimosa but met
him coming from that town he went
slowly back to the point where her
tracks disappeared from the road so
did all the others-all those which he
had met coming from the town he
alighted and examined a tiny side path
leading in and up the mountainside
there was a whole congress of prints
crystals were no longer distinguish-
able but they must be among the many
-at least three horsemen had turned
off the main road here

  stocky turned and found himself pur-
suing a rough trail up the mountain-
side here and there lie almost lost it
and went astray up the tracks beati-n
down by the cattle there for the sum-
mer grazing but he always found it
again and followed it his faculties so
concentrated upon keeping it that he
had no thought left to expend upon the
errand on which he was bent ami upon
the question whether he went as a sup-
porter or a defier of the law now the
low scrubby growths of the mountain
would almost block his progress some-
times he would come out into a natural
clearing among trees and would look in
every direction among the pine-needles
and the grasses for some sign that this
was not the end of all things so far as
stocky brown



  the trail was concerned then lie would
  go  again

   it was red lawsons horse and 
  woodcraft of his own that finally led
  stocky to tlie place he sought he had
  traveled all the afternoon and in the
  trees and the shadows of the higher
  -heights it was already twilight when he
  struck a rough overgrown level there
  were giant boulders here and tall trees
  and some smaller growths it was
  rough and awful as at creations
  morning stocky during his brief
  regin as mrs gordon ramsays pet
  had once sat in her box during a
  performance of die walkiire the
  setting of that opera through which
  he had ungratefully yawned recurred
  to his mind now the same gloom
  the same mystery the same trees and
  rocks it seemed to him were here he
  drew rein to try to determine how to
  thread his way how to keep the trail
  the horse t urned  deliberately in one
  direction-faced a giant boulder it
  seemed to his rider-

   go your own way old bov said
 stocky ive no better suggestion to
 offer and if your impulse is wrong
 well come back and try it again

    straight up to the clifflike wall the
horse trotted knowingly he picked
his way around its base at one end
there was a small opening absolutely
nothing at all at the ground but four
 or live feet higher widening to a jagged
 two feet and then closing into the cliff
 again to this aperture-scarce big-
l ger than the eye of a needle in this im-
i mensity it seemed to stocky-the beast
j trotted he lifted a careful forefoot

 stocky lay forward  his back his

i	arms about the animals neck upright

 he must have been brushed off the sad-
  dle

across the small opening he was car-
 tied and along a sort of passageway

 under a low natural ceiling till he
i came to a space where he felt that he
 could sit erect again ite straightened
 himself in the saddle only the
 branches of trees interrupted his view
 of the sky he was in a natural rough
 amphitheater surrounded by walls of
i rock and by trees he had entered it

lie perceived by the only possible en-
trance-one which he himself woul l
never have believed to be an entrance
his first question was how he would
be able to get back for the space in
which he was seemed destitute of any
sign of life then suddenly he changed
his mind one of the lowering cliffs
before him seemed to open and to let
forth a man w ith a gun leveled di-
rectly at him

  stocky had moments of natural com-
mon sense he raised lis arms now
upon command and the person wiili
the gun advanced toward him keeping
the weapon disconcertingly pointed at
him i another second he was look-
ing down upon black petes ugly face

  get down said black pete terse-
ly stocky got down black pete
scanned the horse ri in lawsons
nag are you he observed does
that mean you come fair an square
or are you a damned informer

  im no informer said stocky
shortly ridiculously angry with the
term although he felt that to be an in-
former in this case would be quite the
most respectable part any one could
play then he saw tliau others had
emerged and approached red law-
son was among them his face dis-
torted with agonized emcuns cr r--
tal white as the face of death was at
her brothers side

  he means  harm to-us pete
she cried with a pause before the pro-
noun stocky could not tell win
it was a confession of guilt or a vol-
untary placing of herself beside her
brother it was he warned me so that
i rode after you and will and found
you coming back along the mimosa
road he means no harm

  how did you get here demanded
pete

  i picked out the trail a far as i
could answered stocky this horse
of lawsons did the rest

  pete continued to stare at him only
half convinced by his words and crys-
tals

  take my gun if you dont believe
me said stocky im bringing no
one here but that doesnt mean that
tub popular magazine

no one will lx brought an angry and
revengeful woman is the leader of this
-vengeance

  you mean crazy babbie she cant
find this place boasted pete she
thinks the cave on the ranch is the
cache for everything  aint afraid of
her-well im in charge here until the
boss shows up you seem to be pased
in youll have to take the conse-
quences all around a shot now-or
youre one of us when the time comes

  im damned it i am cried stocky
energetically iiti in with you enough
tj keep mum hut thats the limit once
this has-he looked at crystal lawson
and spoke more gently-once this lias
blown over our paths lie very far
apart pete teague

  then what are you doin here now
id like to know the big man
growled stocky was moved to wonder
a little back about that himself but
there seemed to be no reasonable an-
swer

  adams arrived by some circuitous
route at the camp during the night
he inquired briefly it stocky meant to
keep quiet about what he knew and
stocky pondering on the problem of
innocent accomplicity briefly gave liis
word the camp-composed of a half-
dozen desperadoes all of whom stocky
had seen more or less often or more
or less permanently on the ranch-
seemed equipped for long concealments
in addition to this there seemed little
tear on the part of the men that they
would be found adams said that he
was quite sure his sister-in-law knew
of no hiding-place but the cave on the
ranch and was of the opinion that
when that proved tenantless the of-
ficers would attribute the whole affair
to her acknowledged queerness and
ail the time red lawson with wretched
face clung to his sister as to a verita-
ble salvation

   bust me ii t dont think the white-
livered baby is afraid commented
pete the same thought had crossed
the mind of stocky but he had a
truer inspiration not fear but re-
morse was the fury tearing at the
heart of the boy to think that he had

planned to return to the ways of de-
cency and sanity and had found him-
self too enmeshed to fight his way out
to think that when he had purposed
a clean slate a fresh page that then
of all limes in the very moment of his
repentance punishment should tail to
think that after all his unpaid months
of evil he might be called upon to pay
at the very threshold of good so 
stocky read his miserable apprehen-
sive eyes his wretched brow and set j
lips and so reading with pity and
sympathy be felt iliat crystal under-
stood his comprehension and that she
gave him a full meed ofgratitude

  the second day red approached him
 ill you talk to me a few minutes 
he asked stocky who was playing
solitaire like several others of the
crowd put aside his cards with alacrity
he and red withdrew a little out in
the open

  if anything happens to me and
crystal gets out will you try to make
it easy some way for her weve got 
some people back east-shell need to j
get away from all this itll remind her
too much

  oh come i say said stocky try- i
ing lo make his voice ring with reas-
surance nothings going to happen
except that youve learned your lesson
and will walk straight hereafter

  oh  have been such a fool the
boy cried suddenly breaking down and
burying bis head in his hands i
wasnt bad to start-only being my
own master went to my head and at
first it wasnt much of anything-
drinking too much gambling a little
then camping up here and feeling a
fine man then a little cattle-rustling-
even that seemed more like a lark and
then came that night at yerkes god
that woke me tip and by that time
my sister was worried to death and be-
cause i wouldnt let her know anything
she set herself to find out and that
night-lord that night she followed
me to bave me she followed me
and that was what she saw he shud-
dered and stocky nodded he had had
some glimmering idea a to the reason
for the girls presence there before
stocky brown



      vnd after that i meant to quit but
  it was easier getting in than out they
  wouldnt let me out they made me
  go into the fiero business with them
  thank god there was no killing there
  and now-because that thundering
  bully adams doesnt know how to
  manage his women folks im likely to
  break her heart and to leave her alone
  and shell never know how much i
  loved her all the time or what a man
  i meant to be to please her at last
  again his boys miserable face was
  hidden in his hands stocky put out
  his own hand and gripped his arm with
  a clasp of friendship

     it anything that you fear comes to
  pass he promised ill be a brother
  to her and dont you worry about
  her love-dont you know shell al-
  ways understand all that you meant
  to be for her but its all coming
  right will its all coming right

    only when the sun was directly
  overhead was there much daylight in
  the -camp on the third day that
  period had passed and the early aft-
  ernoon twilight was deepening into real
  evening it was very peaceful in
  spite of the insecure foundations of
  peace the picketed horses were gra-
  zing a faint cloud broken loose from
  the sunsets glories floated overhead
  gold tooth jim the extempore cook
  was busy in the recesses of the hol-
  low rocks some of the men were
  playing a quiet game of cards one was
  reading a dogs-eared paper novel
  crystal the awful tension of her face
  softening into something like relief
  like hope was seated under the over-
  hang of a little-rock with her brother
  adams had just explained to stocky
  the impregnability of their retreat
  only one man at a time can get in
  he said triumphantly through that
  opening even if any one could ever
  find the opening and we could pick
  off as many as could ride up at that
   rate stocky nodded it seemed to
  him that this was true

   suddenly the air above them was
  shattered with the sound of firing
  stocky jumped to his feet the other
  men more trained to such sounds and

such emergencies sat as they were
and only their eyes moved every
glance was directed upward to the
sound of the shots the top of the
cliff opposite the camp seemed black
with men and every man nad a lev-
eled rifle in his hand

   that cliffs always been inaccessi-
ble said adams with a curse how
did they get there unless theyre mon-
keys not men

  do you all surrender was mega-
phoned down to them

   no curse you  cried pete teague
shut your mouth pete com-
manded adams briefly lie reflected
a minute wed beiur do it boys
he said they can pick us off one
by one from there if we give in and
they come around to capture us-as
theyll have to-we can pick them off
one by one savvy

  after youve pretended to surren-
der demanded stocky hotly

   after that replied adams briefly
   i shall warn them

   if you do itll be the last word youll
ever utter remember you cant irv-
ine too far ive saved you an you
know why but youre only a butter--
in here an youll play the game our
way or not at all

  stocky wavered and in the mom-
entary pause adams made a mega-
phone of his hands we surrender
he bawled

  throw down your arms came the
next command they made a pile of
their revolvers and rifles all under the
steady threat of converging barrels
from above then gradually the gleam
of the rifles was withdrawn the top
of the cliff seemed empty again

  fools snarled adams did they
think wed leave these lying here while
they went round he stooped to
pick up his revolver again

  look out cried red lawson
screaming high and shrill he darted
in front of his sister who stood with
tightly clasped hands at the edge of
the pile of weapons look out
there some one there

  two bullets whizzed downward
through the peaceful air from the guns

of the lookouts left on the cliff and
the flush of light which marked the dis-
charge had nut vibrated to the eyes
of those whom reds warning alarmed
before they -aw him pitch forward on
his face

  when the sheriffs posse made it
way into the enclosure they found a
tirl clinging tenderh to the dead hand
of her brother and another young
man warned them to be careful how
they dealt with her

  it was some ten months after these
events that john randolph brown
journeyed east again-a very different
man from the impulsive irresponsible
youth v ho had come gaily out the year
before inflamed with the hope of
riches with the desire for adventure
with the love of a girl he had had
the adventure and had seen the reverse
side of that medal so brilliant in the
eyes of inexperience he had in all
probability found the riches and he
had found them too late for them to
buy hfs hearts desire and as for
that as for the-golden girl in the grave
affection the sad sense of loss which
stocky held for agatha now there was
little resemblance to the passion that
had tossed him hither and yon

  yet he was only two years older
than when lie had taken his journey
westward i fe was not preternatural-
ly serious or solemn by nature there
was something of yearning eagerness
in the thou lit he sent forward even
if those he cast back upon the land he
was leaving were grave enough

  looking backward lie lived again
through the arrest through the long
ride by crystal lawsons side -to the
county-seat the thought of the peril
in which she stood had not been able
to touch her she was in the deepest
abyss which it is given mortals to
know-in the abyss of grief over the
loss of the creature dearer to her than

any other and of his loss before he

had had a chance to redeem to prove

himelf in the profundity where her
spirit abode during that long ride down
the green mountain along the dusty

plain no one could reach her with me- 
-uige-v from the earths surface meas-
uring his own trouble against hers jj
stocky had forgotten that he was not
in the most cheerful of situations-had
forgotten that he was under arrest that
his innocence might be difficult of
proof that his future was more pre-
carious than it had ever been before

  he forgot his own perplexities and
tried to reach the sore soul beside hirn
with some message of comfort and
by and by he had -ucceeded lie was
a simple-hearted man to whom faith
in the ultimate kindness of the universe
came easily and gently hour alter
hour he besought the stricken girl to
remember that reds conversion had
been complete that it had happened
before danger threatened him  that his
purposes had been all good all glowing
with rightness before he died and
by and by she heard him and turned her
eyes of burning sorrow upon him

  it was true was it not she asked
in her low tense voice he had 
changed he had come back to himself
oh if only he could have lived to j
prove it to undo what he had done 
but he meant to-he meant to didnt
he

  you know he did answered stocky 
steadily you know it and i know
it he did not have to live to prove
it to us did he it was the little 
virginia girl who had caused the staid
merchant brown to commit his only
folly who spoke in her sons voice a
crystal looked at him with deep search-
ing eyes

  you arc sure of it she entreated

  as sure as that were riding down
this road together replied stocky
earnestly

  well that memory was behind him
to sober his exuberances now and
there were other memories-of the lit-
tle court-room of the judge of his
own escape from the charge of com-
plicity in the gangs work of crystal s

	discharge from the same suspicions
j of the holding f the others of the
 fierce avid face of barbara merritt
giving her testimony of her insane
desire to implicate edward winter-
leigh in the doings of the desperadoes
of her confused statements that it had
a been winterleigh who years before
had shown iier the mountain hiding-
 place and the one precarious way to
the top of the cliff commanding it
curiously enough although this was
the only part of her testimony which
the court evidently held to be inspired

i	by insanity it impressed stocky when

ii	she found that it was set at rught she
  grew excited and wound herself in the
  mazes of angry statements which only
  served to prejudice still further the

i opinion against her mental responsi-
bility but to stocky her words held
 an odd inexplicable force

well all that had passed also and
by and by through some marvelous
legal technicality some marvelous skill
i on the part of the attorneys for the de-
fense-they had come from san fran-
 cico and fabulous stories about their
t fees were told-the gallows and the
u prison were cheated stocky remem--

	bered the wild cry of barbara merritt
as the verdict in favor of her brother-
j in-law was rendered lie remembered
f adams eyes bent upon the woman
u and he trembled for her afterward
r he saw the man with his wife and had
u another illustration of the strange ways
i of the human heart mrs adams had
f been excused from testifying on the

-	ground that a wife need not appear
j against her husband she had been at

	each session of the court dry-eyed
i dry-lipped inscrutable in her locked and
 repressed way when adams joined
fher after his release in the corridor of
the jail stocky was near-by the big
r man faltered before the little woman

i h do what youve wanted me to

 mary he said  pull up slakes an

b go to the coast

j and barbara whispered the lit-
i tie woman adams face darkened

  then he watched his wife and the
i frown lifted

 for your sake i will forget what

barbara merritt did he answered
you have things to forget- will for-
get that she can come with us if you
say so

   seth said the little woman with a
choking gratitude you never was a lit-
tle man you never was a mean little
man

  and then there had been the gradual
scattering of the gang and stocky
was camped upon his claim in the sil-
verton hills crystal had gone there
too when she had escaped the jurisdic-
tion of the court

   i always feel better there she had
told stocky with a patient fortitude
seems nearer the sky-no great reach
to heaven and-we were so happy
there he and i that last time until-
you remember the wildcat that came
and called for him to leave me and
leave all the good he was planning and
go back to horrible things 

  i am going to forget that stocky
had answered im going to remem-
ber the boy who wanted his banjo to
play for you-the boy who built you
the porch at silverton ah forget all
the rest crystal dear dear crystal
forget all the rest

  up on the hill he had gradually won
from her some information about the
relatives back east with the result
that he eventually found himself in
formal communication with two maiden
ladies of cambridge massachusetts
concerning their step-niece and later
one golden evening saw him at mi-
mosa watching a train pull out
through a window of which crystal
lawsons apprehensive eyes stared
back at him in mute farewell the
whole plain seemed desolate when she
had gone but he knew that he had done
wisely to persuade her to go the
change which was so dreadful to her
was what she needed to arouse her
mind from brooding on the past she
was young she was healthy she was
no longer despairing-she must re-
spond to stimulus of novelty the
winter in cambridge-he laughed con-
trasting it with a winter in silvers 
he was lonely but he was glad he h 
persuaded her to go


the povjlar magazine

  then he had gone back to his own
camp and to work and the miracle
had happened lie had found copper
he had hurried to the experts in mi-
mosa and i hence lo the experts in
dcining lie was excited naturally
riches seemed near and though riches
could not buy him another mans af-
fianced bride still they were exciting to
contemplate exciting it was too to
think that the whole region was veined
with the precious metal and that crys-
tal who lamented in her letters the
narrow circumstances of the two dear
little ladies who had taken her to their
hearts might be able to give them the
innocent joys they craved

   it was as the result of the opinions
and the advice of the western mine
experts that he was going east now
fie laughed boyishly to contrast his con-
dition with his condition when he had
gone west then he was leaving in
deep disgrace with barely enough
money to take him to his destination
which however it was put was no other
place than coventry now he was
coming back with money in his pockets
to undertake the formation of a com-
pany to work the agatha and crystal
mines he had named his after his old
love-he could not help it and mr
lawsons mine had always been the
crystal stocky liked to link the names
of the two girls thus-the name of the
women lie loved and could not hope to
marry and the name of the dear friend
and comrade whom he never dreamed
of wanting fo marry

   his letters east had won quick re-
plies uncle ephraim was prepared to
welcome him warmly mrs ramsay
was sure that he had outgrown the
follies his friends had been obliged
for his own sake to frown upon mr
ramsay would be very happy to see
him in his office at such and such a
time winterleigh in a brief note was
offhandedly affable and congratula-
tory fite men of the eighty-seventh
were for dining and wining and gen-
erally feting their old hero duncan
wanted to propose him for non-resi-
dent membership in a few of the best
clubs-if youre really going back

old fellow instead of working your

mines from an office on the thirty- 

fourth floor of a new york building
as most of you big miners do he had

written only agatha of all his little
circle had made no sign that she had 
heard of his home-coming stocky was i
half hurt and half commended her in
his mind for a delicate prudence how 
could she after that last letter to him 
write to him of little commonplaces i
make him pretty speeches on his roseate 
prospect of fortune

  in spite of everything-of instinct-
ive unquestioning decency which made i
him put wpe of agatha utterly away i
from him of maturity of mind which i
made him no longer the plaything of
his emotions of cares and preoccupa-
tions and memories in spite of all it
was with something of a tumult that he
thought of meeting her again was t
not mr ramsay only too politely amen-
able to the suggestion concerning the i
mining company was not mrs ram- j
say quite as sure that he would be a
lion like adorn men t to her drawing-
room as before his wretched fiasco at j
jarmeads surely he would have to 
see agatha he began to wonder 
when and how when the train drew
in under the grand central roof he
was in a confusion of hope fear and 
longing and of misery because his j
hopes and fears alike were nothing to i
her must forever be nothing to her

  the february dusk was falling over
the sparkle of the avenue as he drove j
down toward the hotel whatever the 
chance of forming a big eastern com-
pany to mine the agatha and the crys-
tal the westerners had believed in
those properties enough to equip stocky
handsomely with funds for his em-
bassy consequently he was driving in
a hansom his eager face scanning the
crush of roadway and sidewalk with
the home-comers look of exultation and
fondness consequently he was going
to put up at a glittering hostelry con-
sequently if he- had any moderately
extravagant desires he might blame-
lessly gratify them the radiant tropics
of a florists window caught his eye
lie poked open the trap of communi-
stocky brown

cation with his driver stop here
he cried in the old impetuous stocky
fashion in a minute he stood inside
the flower-shop doors

    those are queer fellows he said
  nodding toward some orchids in the big
  window the salesman with a modest
  air of regretting that he so far sur-
  passed all competitors opined that
  stocky would find nothing so remark-
  able so distangay in the citv he
  shifted a jar of them so that the light
  fell upon them more directly every
  fragile blossom of pink and lavender
  as ethereal as evening skies in spring
  as fountains leaping in the sunny air
  was stained with a deep blotch of
  crimson

    i dont like them said stocky de-
  cidedly yet he kept on looking at
  them he made a round of the store
  peering into white-tiled storage-boxes
  and through glass cases but by and
  by he came back to the wonderful flow-
  ers their delicacy-spoiled was it or
  only accentuated by the red stain 

send a box of those he said and
z gave a name and address on north
washington square no-no card
t then he stood looking around him
 could you send some stuff over to
 cambridge in any sort of condition 
he asked upon the clerks assurance
that the flowers of that shop were of a
i freshness and a durability which could
withstand a journey ten times as long
he sought to choose again roses 
 no roses were for any one-the kind
i lady who dined you last night the
i aspiring young actress to whom you

	were introduced at somebodys tea
i your mothers old friend the wife of
i the man you wished to interest in this
 or that no roses were not for crys-
t tal he wandered about quite ttnhap-
 pily no flower seemed quite right for
f her this was a poor shop apparent-
 lv out on the desert or up on the
 hills he could have found a dozen
i blooms appropriate enough and final-
ly to the immense disgust of the flor-
ist it was a box of shining laurel-
leaves among which lay starry jasmine-
blooms that went off to cambridge
and then the lilies-of-the-valley were

ordered for the grave of her who had
been the little virginia bride of so
many years ago and stocky went so-
berly back to his hansom

   in spite of the cordiality of the let-
ters he had received there was no one
to share his first evening with him he
felt rather lonely even a little hurt
he had to remind himself that he had
not announced the time of his arrival
he dressed himself as magnificently a
his sartorial equipment permitted and
went splendidly down in the elevator
to dine in state even if it was a soli-
tary and therefore unappetizing state
he wondered uncomfortably feeling
many eyes upon him as he threaded his
way through the dining-room it his
evening clothes were already so bi-
zarre as to attract attention or his
waistcoat so lamentably out of date
those clothes were only a paltry two
years old he mentally explained to the
crowd they had been ordered to do
grace to the scenes in which agatha
ramsay had been wont to shine it
never occurred to him that anything
except his clothe could seem remark-
able that his six feet plus of lean mus-
cular length was unusual that his face
was bronzed almost to indian dark-
ness and that the fair brown of his
hair and the clear american blue of his
eyes contrasted with it in a fashion to
win ladies passing glances

  after all in spite of how in camp
with one kettle a frying-pan a tin of
coffee a side of bacon and a bag of
corn-meal as his entire culinary outfit
he had planned the herculean feasts he
would have on his return to civiliza-
tion he found small appetite for the
meal he could order now he had not
the makings of a gourmet in him after
all it had not been mere food which he
had wanted out there irtthe hills nor
even food served in such surroundings
as these-a discreetly distant band dis-
coursing popular music and wagner
with charming impartiality overgrown
carnations blooming amid the shaded
lamps noiseless deferential servitors
and all the rest it was these things
added to the one thing that gave them
all color and meaning and charm-in-


the vovulvr magazine

timate companionship he wondered

how crystal would took upon such a
scene as this and began to sketch a
scheme by which he coil id induce her
and the two little old ladies to come
over fur a week of cheerfully vulgarly
ornate living- in new york

  suddenh his planning was arrested
a party swept in to a reserved table
two or three removed from his the
women  had dropped their wraps in
some cloak-room outside the dining-
room and all their delicate lines were
revealed by their frock- they were
hatless also ami their shining beauti-
fully coilted heads were held with the
grace and pride of well-trained new
york women but stocky stared past
the re t of them toward one it was
agatha agatha very slim very sinu-
ous in a long faintly shimmering black
frock agatha with golden hair piled
royally on her royally held head
agatha the incarnation of young grace
and wealth and pride and-and surely
-pleasure yet as stocky stared at
her his heart fell not alone with the
thought of her inaccessibility but with
a vague realization of subtle change in
her	

  there was the slightest hardening
of her soft outlines as it were as
though the velvet were brushed from
a butterflys wings there was the
slightest intensifying of all her physical
qualities-as though time had applied
a little make-up to her and in the
brilliancy of her look the assurance
of her smile and glance and bearing
stocky saw no deepening of her joy-
ousness when she sat down she was
almost back to him he saw a flower
drooping at her ear it was one of his
orchids all sorts of emotions began
to riot in him all sorts of absurd hopes
and fancies interleigh was not of
this party agatha wore his flower-
stocky s agatha had written him
nothing lately could it all mean that
the engagement was broken  and that
she hesitated to risk the meaning such
a statement would have for stocky
could that look-a remote suggestion
of the defiant of the wilful-could that
mean that she had broken with winter-

leigh and dared her world to criticize
her the blood raced through his

veins at the thought

  by and by the man opposite her at

the table leaned toward her and said i
something when she in answer to
this turned her head so as to command
a view of stocky that young man was 
conscious that he had been staring uiu i
forgivably-devouring her with his i
eyes when she saw and recognized
him-he half rose as she turned and
wholly did so when the flash of greet-
ing lighted her eyes-he grew almost
dizzy and light-headed he crossed to 
her table in response to the dazzle of
her look in a minute he was clasping
her hand hearing her delighted outcry 
bowing to the others

  the prodigal returned-and leading i
his own fatted calves behind him-
droves of them swarms of them herds 
of them-what is the collective for
calves she cried inviting the stern
parent and the elder brother-thats 
uncle ephraim and all of us-to come 
feast indeed mrs jestley that is ex-
actly what he is dont you remember j
doesnt every one remember my excel- j
lent edwards raid and the famous hero i
whom lie caught at jarmeads-mr
john randolph brown of manzanita
indeed  shant stop and how mr j
john randolph browns family and ac-
quaintance frowned upon the jarmead i
episode and sent him into the wilder-
ness to reflect upon the error of his
ways and now he comes back with
all the-

  please please laughed stocky
do mrs jestley in mercy to a bash-
ful cowboy stop her

  bashful cowboys there are no
bashful cowboys rattled agatha with-
out giving mrs jestley a chance to re-
spond to the appeal all cowboys
shoot up all places where food and
drink are sold-mr brown will pro-
duce a six-shooter in a second and be-
gin firing at all the art-glass electro-
liers around the wall- and they all

have beautiful half-breed girls in every
town who play the spanish guitar for
them-havent they she ended sud-
denly with a direct look at stocky
stocky brown



   dont let the cold water of fact
quench your charming fancies miss
ramsay drawled one of the men mr
-er-mr brown woidd not be so un-
gallant as to lop off a single dark dam-
sel of your imagination im sure

   certainly not said stocky hurt he
 knew not why by all her banter
 theyre all miss ramsays own crea-
 tion and no one but herself shall put
 them to death

   mr brown said mrs jestley now
theres a marvelous dancer who comes
on late in a very stupid show at the
alcazar were bound for her after
dinner wont you join us theres
an extra seat in the box miss ram-
says young man failed us at the last
minute-

   poor edward supplemented miss
ramsay he had to chase up to mat-
teawan to do something about a most
uninteresting lunatic

   so wont you take his place fin-
ished mrs jestley

   agatha looked at him lie could not
tell whether it was an imp of mischief
or some little spirit of pensiveness
which lurked in her eyes as she re-

 	jpeated softly yes-wont tou take his
 place 

   thank you he answered a trifle
awkwardly i shall be very glad to

ccme now- i see my man has

brought my coffee i will join you
again

   i le went back to his own table his
head in a whirl he could no more

	see agatha ramsay unmoved he told
himself than he could drink strong
 spirits and feel no fever in his blood
and the look in her eyes baffled him
why hadnt they married anyway she

	and winterleigh  surely once the
words had been read over her that
abound her to another irrevocably she
could not stir him thus surely then
ibis heart must acknowledge the invisi-
ble barrier

   me went to bed that night excited
imiserable he had not known that it
was in him to desire another persons
property and it was in some such
t unenlightened way that stocky re-
garded another mans affianced wife

the jargon of freedom in the emo-
tions had passed him by and among all
his adventures he had not counted ac-
quaintance with the live-your-own-life
men and women so it came to pass
that it disturbed him with a sense of
disloyalty to find himself -so inflamed
by the presence of wimerleighs be-
trothed it was an insult too to her
he thought what sort of affection was
it he demanded hotly which he pre-
tended to feel  would not any decent
woman feel aghast to learn that she
promised to one man was the object of
another mans passionate desires r

  he opened his windows wide but the
noise of the city the air of the city did
not bring calmness he longed for
the great spaces of the hills their clean
winds then he thought of the other
troubled soul who always took her
troubles to that place of healing and
thinking of crystal stocky became
himself again

xl

  when my dear miss maenad do you
mean to marry me so spoke mr
winterleigh to his affianced at tlie
moment she deserved in outward seem-
ing at least the term he had applied
to her her eyes were glittering her
cheeks inflamed the laughter of her
red lips was high and uncertain her
fiance looked at her with a cool appre-
ciation between them was a table lit-
tered with the remains of luncheon it
was the only table in the small discreet
apartment

  agatha threw back her head and re-
garded him through lowered tills

  do you know my dear friend she
said ignoring his question youre
quite the cleverest man i know

  he ho wed in mock gratitude

  it is not cleverness to appreciate
you to want  marry you it would
be imbecility not to he assured her

 oh nonsense agatha knocked
ashes from the tip of her cigarette
im not out for compliments to-day
i mean that i dont believe any other
man on earth would have been clever
enough to give a perfectly respectable


the vo-puuir magazine

jjerfectly accredited engagement the
spice of the forbidden by-this -she
nodded meditatively about the room
winterleigh reached a bottle from the
cooler and filled her glass again with
golden bubbles

  that was not cleverness my dear
he assured her and it was not the
desire to please your palate by a taste
of forbidden spice that i introduced
you to legaris private rooms how
else was i ever to achieve speech with
you alone your dear mother agatha
is a charming woman whom i greatly
admire-

  admire you fairly tlirt with her

  whom i greatly admire pursued
winterleigh suavely but she is too
omnipresent tor mv feelings as a lover
at your ik-me and in society in general
you are too hedged about with thorns
my rwe so l inveigle you to legaris
where i can at least-he arose and
earie over to her chair-where  can
at ieast kiss you unobserved he did
so

  well whatever your intentions re-
plied agatha accepting the salute indif-
ferently there is a spice of naughti-
ness about it all that satisfies something
wicked in me do you ever pause to
consider edward that i am a perverse
and sinful young woman i love what
is not seemly as for example cham-
pagne and cigarettes and back stairways
to private rooms and-and-unregis-
tered kisses arent you afraid of me

  if you were a domestic pussy-cat
answered winterleigh quietly you
could never have appealed to a man of
my disposition im a great criminal
lawyer-i suppose i may say that here
with no one but you to accuse me of
vanity-not because i hate crime but
because i love crime f feel it and its
workings i can follow the steps that
lead to it in men who are reckless
enough to indulge their taste for it if
you re born with criminal desires my
dear-and a brain-perhaps i should
emphasize that-and a brain-it is
much better and more profitable to be-
come a great criminal lawyer than to
become a great criminal you have
more fun a longer run for your money

  you can follow your mans career
from the first dawning of his tempta-
tion  maybe it happened when he was
a boy playing ball in thetstreels of a
village maybe it never ntailed him
until be was a man established as he
thought in uprightness well you can
ee the dawn of the idea-you can trace
its devious courses through him-
through the grooves worn by conven-
tion by affection by all sorts of train-
ing you can follow it to its end and
then you can be his defender or his
prosecutor just as seems better-just as
seems more likely to provide more
stars of glory or of diamonds for the
head of your captive agatha who was
also born with a little devil in her
though he has been prudently concealed
by the habits and customs of washing-
ton square north he bent over her
again and this time the girl shrank a
little

  if you are not afraid afraid that i
shall break over the traces she said
sometimes i am afraid of you you

-you-its the admixture of brains that
makes you terrifying to the imagina-
tion

  ah and its just that half-terror
which i count upon to help keep you
in order he told her laughing a
little fear is a fine wholesome ingre-
dient in a wifes love but im talk-
ing nonsense when will you marry
me that money from your grand-
mother which you so carefully and
providently thought it best to wait for
-havent you reached the age when her
will said it was to be settled absolutely
on you  not that i care anything about
that except that you deferred the cere-
mony until you should have that in
hand why by the way 

 oh i dont knov  answered
agatha a caprice i suppose and
of course it wasnt certain what papa
would settle on me

  sometimes ive thought it was a de-
sire to defer-the happy hour he
watched her as he made the suggestion
she started and across her flushed face
a deeper rose ran

  how silly she commented

  yes  see now that it was he
stocky bvown



 smiled strangely upon her t see now
 that it must have been sometimes i
 have beeti half-inclined to be jealous
 and to think that after all you werent
 sure-that you were sparring for time
 -that you had some regrets for mrs

 jest leys wonderful son gustave-

   that imbecile

   or old fletcher or young brown
 or one of the rest of your adorers
 flis eyes never left her face as he light-
 ly recited the list at stockys name
 there was a lotk of arrest as it were
 in her eyes

    but ive gotten all over that since
 weve taken to coming here resumed
 winterleigh easily of course no
 young lady as sophisticated as miss
 agatha ramsay comes to a place like
 -well comes to legaris with a man
 even a fiance unless-unless she likes
 him very well

   agathas proud head was erect
 after all you are not so clever as i
 thought she said cuttingly t thought
 yon were too clever to tell me that i
 had compromised myself i thought
 vou too clever to think that i would
 care-that-she threw her cigarette
 away

my dear agatha you misunderstand
me wilfully said winterleigh of
 course i know that you would be no-
 bly-there was a satiric smile on his
lips-indifferent to censure i was
only thinking of young-jestley for
g example

    then the color dyed her face deeply

	she knew him and the workings of his
nmind well enough to realize that it was
-stocky whom he meant stocky of
vwhom he had had jealous doubts
j stocky with whose disapprobation he
 now threatened her and she knew

	too that for all her boast all her in-
idomitable pride of mien she had a
i fierce desire that stocky should at
f least never think lightly of-her if she
j could not make him love her-and since
 his return to the east she knew why she
 had deliberately tried to lure him to
i some expression of tenderness-at least
 let him never think of her otherwise
l than as he did now with his unworldly

	old-fashioned restraint and respect

  winterleigh watched the color flare
and then ebb he followed the cours-
ing emotions of her mind then
when she looked pale and almost beat-
en he leaned over to her and took lnr
unresisting hand gently

  my dear agatha he said gravely
i have talked in a way unworthy of
my devotion to you forgive me
sometimes jealousy is a very goading
thing and drives men to madness i
am jealous in a way-as why should i
not be after all i am a nobody from
god-knows- where-an astute lawyer
whos able to make a decent income-
no more and even that is due to lucky
investments-a tip here and there my
ancestry-how your good mother would
scorn it and here i have aspired to
the beauty and the belle the wit and the
toast of her time do you wonder i
am sometimes worried-frightened at
my good fortune suppose it should
all turn to fairy gold in my hands
dear forgive me

  i suppose i shall have to said
agatha coquettishly looking at him
she liked her sense of being a lion-
tamer alas she liked the sense of so
many things she demanded so many
emotions so many excitements  never
for one whole day had she ardently de-
sired and worked for one single end
never had she known a clear uncom-
plicated hour all her emotional life
had been a succession of little gusts
now five minutes after she had hated
w interleigh for basely vilely daring
to show her that he had her reputation
in his power five minutes after she had
desired stockys boyish chivalry of
adoration she was pleased with the
vision of herself as beauty leading the
beast by gav silken threads she ptilled
on her long gloves with a half-trium-
phant air as she looked across the table
to her vis-a-vis

xvii

  it was in april that stocky became
greatly puzzled by the inexplicable be-
havior of his friend crystal she had
acknow ledged the receipt of his floral
tributes two months before with the


the vopular magazine

completed cordiality her first letters
were full of anticipations of what they
should do when he came over to cam-
bridge to see her how he would love
the little old ladies how he would
revel in the gracefulness ot the elms
even though they were still bare how
he would weave romances for the staid
old houses that stood behind them
iiow he would read history anew here
where so much of history began thus
wrote crystal forgetting that the hast
was not to stocky the unknown land it
had been to her the man laughed as
he read her letters-it pleased him to
see how completely at one with her she
felt him to be that was the very es-
sence of friendship he told himself she
even took for granted the unity of
their previous experiences it was a
very different attitude from agathas
baffling hew ildering maddening sad-
dening one

  then suddenly crystal had developed
a few inexplicabilities of her own it
aa- apropos of the visit to new york
the little ladies when tentatively ap-
pr ached on the subject had been re-
ported as eager for the adventure
stock had rejoiced thinking that if
vheir objections to new york were over-
come it would all be easy sailing so
he had written joyfully to crystal tell-
ing her of what he was planning of
the friends who would help him make
this visit a memorable one for the
two spinsters of tlie dazzling miss
ramsay who would undoubtedly appear
to them as a personification of old ro-
mance so brilliant so beautiful was
she and yet so kind-she would be
sure to delight in showing the kind and
tender side of herself to the old ladies

  whereupon crystal wrote him a brief
little note stating that after all she
found it to be quite impossible for her
to come to new york at present she
was doing a little special work at rad-
cliffc-at which information the un-
academic stocky felt himself an il-
literate boor and half regretted that
unfinished collegiate course of his she
really couldnt come stocky wrote in
protest she replied more tersely yet
and with more final emphasis only in

her last paragraph a hint of feeling of

friendliness showed itself

  please believe that i am not ungrateful for

all that you would have us share with you
indeed indeed  am but what  am doing

here carries on the work my father tried
to begin with me and my dear brother all
the gaiety and excitement you plan do not
belong to the scheme it would do me noih
mg but harm  think to change the peaceful
current of our existence here my time is
short anyway  am going back a soon uj
the winter term is over  long for my home
as fur you  remember now what  have
sometimes forgotten that  this-or lhat in

new york-is your true environment i am
of course so sorry not to meet the lovdy
miss ramsay slip must be all that is
charming-quite like the belles of bath and

such places when there used to be belles
indeed however it i ouly a pleasure de-
ferred i hope some time she will doubt-
less come west to see her namesake the
agatha mine

  and stocky pondered pained and
even belligerent first he telegraphed
that the whole thing was nonsense any-
way-by which he meant her elaborate
objections-and that he was coming
over to tell her so he was coming
the very next day then there was a
meeting called of tlie financiers whom
he was trying to induce to finance the
mines and he had to telegraph the visit
off whereupon came a long wrathful
reply from crystal forbidding him to
come at all to cambridge to see her
figuratively stocky tore his hair in
amazement literally he seemed stolid
enough

  the telegram had been handed to
him in the down-town office he had
taken lie had become such a busy man
of affairs in these few weeks that tele-
grams delivered at his hotel were al-
ways sent to his office and vice versa
so that crystals bomb was fired into a
meeting of grave gentlemen concerning
themselves with the apportionment of
stock stocky read it with unmoved
countenance his brown face had ac-
quired in the course of his relations
with capitalists and promoters some-
thing of uncle ephraims power of
concealment so that no one knew that
he was nonplused and outraged by the
communication he had received

  mr gordon ramsay and he left the
stocky brown



 meeting together as they were apt to
 do in these days they stepped into
 jjtockys automobile-he had set up
 tnk means of locomotionjts soon as lie
 had perceived that the company was to
 be a go in spite of the annoyance of
 red tape and green hills that must be
 endured before its final incorporation
 lie had always liked machinery and he
 had recently learned to like open spaces
 his new toy on the boulevards of
 westchester county was not equal to
 lady gay streaming across the plain
 but it was better than anything else
 available in the big city

   ill drop you at home said stocky
 who was running his own car

   drop out with me dora has some
 people in to-day to meet lady gwendo-
 len mertha-the titled chicken-raiser
 you know-or is it pigs

  stocky laughed i thought that
 was to-morrow he said mrs ram-
 say asked- me to come meet her to-

 	morrow

   i think its to-day was the hus-

 	bands response though to tell the
 r truth i cant keep track of doras pet
  ittractions shes indefatigable my

 vifef

   ill stop and confound her by my

 -	presence if she has made a mistake

   but it turned out that it was mr
 ramsay who had made the mistake
 the big drawing-rooms were deserted
 j stockys heart sank

  vou win remarked the host
wait a minute and ill see if i cant

 	care up some one to give us a cup of
 ea properly bootson is mrs ram-

 rav at home

   no sir said boot son but miss
 ramsay is in her boudoir sir

   ask her if she will give mr brown
 iad me a cup of tea i find tea is a
 aabit that grows on one brown i
 -tsed to laugh at the women but upon
 my word it does give you a harmless
 lift at the fag-end of the day braces
 vou to last until dinner and it hasnt
 he after-effect of the cocktail which
 ome men take	

 i never cared for cocktails myself
 raid stocky his eyes upon the door

  like my spirits plain better

     

  miss ramsay will be down imme-
diately sir announced boot-on

  she came clad in an intimate mar-
velous clinging thing of pale gold-cul-
ored crepe her father regarded it a
little questioningly

  its a perfectly proper tea-gown
papa she declared not a negligee at
all as your looks imply although of
course i realizes that grandma ram-
say never never wore such a r- ment
in her life -aid that therefore it uisi
seem altogc ler impossible to y

  the telephone jangled mr ramsay
was summoned talked caine back
swallowed some tea wifcb a frown and
declared that he had to go out at once
stocky felt that he ought to go also
but the golden vision lured him to stay
besides her tired eyes pleaded word-
lessly with him to remain they seemed
to reproach him with having avoided
her all these weeks he stayed

  when they were alone he was move 
to tell agatha of crystals amazing at-
titude-he felt that there was safety
in talking of crystal in bringing her
into the group as it were- agatha lis-
tened keenh

  so she said when he had finished
so youve been at your old tricks mr
brown when will you learn to stop
flirting its no lit pastime for a man
of affairs her face for all the mock-
ing smile on the lips was sad ami
worn

  oh you dont understand cried
stocky impatiently  this girl-flirt-
ing  vou might as well accuse me of
flirting with a straight young birch-tree
or a mountain brook shes unspoiled
nature-

  ah breathed agatha sharply he
stared but she said no more only
watched him out of burning eyes

  but this foolish east of yours seems
to have complicated even her look
at the nonsensical stuff she writes me
he dived into his pocket and drew out
a bundle of letters crystals last ef-
fusion among them agatha silently
read the pages he handed to her when
she came to the references to herself
her look brightened

  my silly young friend she began


the wpular magazine

returning the sheets to him you liave
evidently been praising me

  not at all i merely stated a few
truths about you

  ah you dont know any truths about
me but no matter at any rate your
wild brook of the mountains-your
belle sourac-is angry shes jealous
dear simpleton  now don t get cross
and look a- though you were thinking
what a horrid waspish mind i have i
havent but i am a woman-and i
know what it is to be jealous t lie girl
is jealous of your praise of me  hat s
all go over to cambridge invade the
bower of the two old ladies seize your
nymph in barbarian style by the houl-
ders and say to her the agatha of
whom you were so foolishly jealous is
k-s than nothing to me except as she
mav help you to a holiday she is prom-
ised to another man she is not the sort

of woman i admire and-

  gatha cried stocky he leaned
toward her she was always intoxi-
cating to his senses and now the tor-
mented mockery of her voice pierced
i - heart as well

  go tell her that cried agatha
and -ec how the sunshine will play
upon the mountain brooks face

  i can tell her no lies whispered
stocky she makes me speak the truth
-she is so simple and honest and so
if i said anything it must be-he
leaned closer to her drawn by the
magic of her beauty by the command

of ler glances-it must be-

  agatha what do you think broke
in the high voice of mrs ramsay
drawing open the hall portieres oh
how do you do mr brown agatha
have you any tea left i started to tell
you that that queer electric genius with
the fuzzy hair has a wife so of course
we cant ask him why mr brown
youre not going

  stocky was conscious of the inco-
herence of what he mumbled in reply
but he had to get out of the room out
of the surcharged air he sprang into
his machine and tore up the avenue at
a law-breaking speed out through the
park up the broad seventh avenue
roadway out and out into the country

now growing sweet and luminotuly
green with spring ilis brain was in a
turmoil he had not imagined it was
in him so nearly to be false to what he
regarded as simple honor yet how sad
her eyes were she was not happy in
that engagement who was winter
k igh that he should win this peerless
creature why should not stocky tell
the ugly story of that half-crazed girl
on the ranch and save agatha from the
union which he was beginning to be-
lieve she bated but was the story i
true or a delusion of a disordered
mind

   on and on and on through the quiet
evening until air and motion and the
comparative stillness of the country- 
side calmed his nerves and restored
him to himself lie turned to the right j
from among the low pocantico hills and j
swerved down toward the shore of the j
sound there would be a moon to- j
night he would eat his dinner at one 
of the sound restaurants and go lei-
surely home and he would go over i
to cambridge tc-morrowr and see the j
hitherto sane and sincere crystal that 
was all nonsense of course about her
being jealous  only agathas own un- j
certain wavering emotions only per-
haps a lurking remnant of tenderness j
for him made her interpret the other
girls vagaries so falsely anyway he 
would go and see crystal and be
strengthened by her he thought with
deep yearning and affection of her of
her loneliness of the sorrow that had 
embittered her life without somehow j
embittering her nature yes he would j
go and see crystal and as soon as
might be he would leave this great city
of noise and crowds of feverish ambi- j
lions and emotions and would get back
to the wide spaces and the free air of
the hills		j

  soothed by these determinations he
ate his dinner in a road-house on the
shore then having smoked a leisure-j
iv cigar or two watching his few fel- i
low diners with the interest that he was
till young enough to feel he went out 
to the hotel garage and at that min-
ute a runabout puffed into the yard
towing another machine in the tonneau
stocky brown



 of which sat two oversprightly young
 women one of the men in the run-
 about jumped out and stocky recog-
 nized a friend of duncans and a casual
 -acquaintance of his own a man named

 	howitzer

   thank the kind lord youre here
 brown called out howitzer address-
 ing him we came to utter and com-
 plete grief and smash about five miles
 out and this gentleman-indicating
 the other man in the runabout-hap-
 pened along and was good enough to
 drag us this far but he was bound in
 the opposite direction and he can act

 	as pilot no longer after weve had a
 snack here-are you alone he sud-
 denly broke off

    yes quite

    well then after weve had a snack
 here perhaps you wouldnt mind taking
 us back to town 

    stocky had never cared for howitzer

  but it wai not in his nature to refuse
 a simple service he did not suggest
 the excellence at lie late trains from
 i the shore villages but said that of

 	course hed be ver happy to be of use
 whereupon the conveyer of the wreck
 having taken his leave stocky was in-
  troduced to miss hazel lemoine and
 i miss pinky montmorenci and to the
 very complete and thoroughgoing dis-
 ability of howitzers machine

   ill leave it here overnight
 growled howitzer and send down my
 chauffeur in the morning i was a

 	blamed fool to come out without him-
 lies a frenchman and a james-dandy

  but-you understand-servants talk
 j-and madamc wouldnt altogether ap-
  prove of the young ladies theyre
 i trying to get positions on the stage

 	both of them have appeared in one or

 	two musical shows im doing wliat i
 can to get them places-i know a few
 rmanagers and upon my word they
 -seemed so cooped up in their boarding-
  house when i dropped in this afternoon

 	to hear their reports of some interviews
 vyesterday that i couldnt resist offering
  them a outing it was really pa-
 lithetic the way they jumped at the
 chance thus howitzer in long and

 	labored explanation of his companions

and his plight stocky merely nodded
and grunted and developed a great in-
terest in his cigar

  hang it muttered llowiizer mov-
ing toward the dining-room in which
he had already established hi charges
hell get us home anyway-and the
train is out of the question with the
madamc spending the day with her sis-
ter at cos cob

  it seemed to stocky awaiting his
passengers on a porch overlooking the
moonlit waters of the sound that miss
lemoine and miss montmorenci were
prodigiously heavy eaters w hen after
a long time the dinner-party appeared
lie feared that they had been prodigi-
ously heavy drinkers as well he was
annoyed as he drove the car ahead
through the blossom-scented spring
night the silly ignorant vulgar chat-
ter from the tonnean grated on him
he thought of the mountain cabin and
crystal before the fire  he thought of
agathas haughtily held fair head and
air of disdain for all that was low and
ugly pretty- companions had he
stocky brown friend of two such
women succeeded in picking up

  perhaps in the vehemence of his de-
sire to get rid of his embarrassing party
stocky drove with unaccustomed reck-
lessness perhaps it was just pure
fate mr howitzer always thought of
it as nemesis and the young ladies as
unexpected advertising at any rate
when they were just reentering the up-
per end of the city they collided with
another madly driven car and in a
second they were lying in a heap in a
ditch

  when stocky moving gingerly
found that he himself was whole his
first alarm was for the young ladies
their shrill and uninterrupted cries
reassured him as to their lives from
the other automobiles party-a group
of drunken friends of the chauffeur
who had taken it out of the garage-
came a fluent stream of profanity only
howitzers voice seemed silent in the
general melee two policemen came
running from the encircling darkness
another machine stopped to proffer
service a trolley-car making its late


the pg-pulvr magazine

passenger less way out to the bridge

paused while the conductor ran to the
scene of the accident

  the chauffeurs party was making

charges against stocky for a minute
or two he was indifferent to them his
mind solely upon howitzer who lay
with his face white and his eyes closed
in the moonlight one of the police-
men discovered that his heart was heal-
ing however and stocky breathed a
sigh of relief and gave his attention
to the complaints of the other side
there were a few minutes ot mutual
recrimination and then the whole com-
bined party found itself bound tor the
precinct station in one ot the machines
which had paused lo investigate and
which the police had commandeered
all but howitzer that is who was
borne to the nearest drug-storc and
an ambulance summoned

  at the station they all found them-
selvt-except the young ladies-held
fur a later appearance the chauffeur
c niderably sobered by this went
sheepishly under guard to the tele-
phone to acquaint his employer with
the situation stocky filming followed
he had no real estate in new york to
offer as security lie must follow the
chauffeurs example and call for help
at the moment he could think of no one
but duncan duncan was to blame
for this anyway introducing his
bounder acquaintances to a man

 duncan had just come into his
rooms as it happened and was en-
gaged in a telephonic talk with his
cousin agatha who had phoned him up
earlier in the evening and had left the
request that he call her up upon their
cousinly intercourse concerning a dog
which agatha desired as an adjunct to
the place at tuxedo the police tele-
phone intruded there was a trian-
gular mix-up for a few seconds then
agatha discreetly retired from the talk
though not as after developments
showed from the wire

  of course duncan was as friendly
and serviceable as any kindly disposed
young new yorker is naturally to a
man with copper-mines up his sleeve
of course he would come at once and

get his friend out of his plight and
hadnt they better be prepared lo ar-
range some soothing tale for mrs

 lowitzers ears- 

  meantime the reporter of the morn-
ing clarion yawning over the dearth 

	f interesting news until the automo-
bi lists had cotvie in talked with the can-
didates fr stage honors he was an
astute young man and a young man 
with a memory brown the young
ladies thought lie must be a rich young
man from the west from what poor
mr howitzer hail said at dinner did
tiny r oh he was one who had been j
quite a hero in the cuban war and who 
had left the city in disgrace after a 
gambling-raid  ah yes he rcmem- i
bered thanks so much he made a
few notes until duncan and the irate
owner of the other machine arrived

  when stocky awoke the next mom- 
ing he found himself once more the 
hero of a front page he read the
story attentively it was marvelous to 
him how by the mo-t delicate manipu- l
lation of a few facts the young re- 
porter had framed a tale so incontro- j
vertible and so false miss lemoine j
and mis montmorenci well known on 
broadway had been his guests had
they they and mr howitzer who j
was stunned but not seriously injured j
by his accident lie himself was be- j
ginning to be quite a figure in the 
sporting life of the city was he he
would be remembered as one of those 
taken two years ago in the famous raid 
of winterleigh then assistant district j
attorney at jarmeads-the raid from j
which jarmead had never recovered i

  well the difference between now
and the time of the affair two years j
ago was that now he couldnt be sent i
away for punishment uncle ephraim j
might frown and puff and look porten-
tous but uncle ephraim wanted some j
part in the great agatha mine property 
anil would not carry his sternness far 
and so with all the rest-except per- j
haps agatha and crystal fie could
see agathas scorn of him on her curl- j
ing red lip in her disdainful eye in
her stately distance he could see
crystals wide-eyed amazement and
stocky brown



 disgust her silent withdrawal it
served him right the whole thing for
i not having told howitzer to go to the
devil in the first place

   l ie opened his mail there was a
 letter in agathas clear handwriting
 he scanned it half hating to open it
 the postmark caught his eye it had
 been mailed at midnight just when
 that garbage-collector was gathering
 that information from thos women
 said stocky to himself politely refer-
 ring to the reporter and his inform-
 ants of the night before finally he

	tore it open and read

   can such tilings be and is he merely

	human after all a little bird has been at
  my window to-night and lie has told me
  naughty things when will you come and
  be forgiven

   well ill be hanged said stocky
 solemnly how the devil could she
 know this-this mess-before it was
 well in the station-house did dun-
 can tell her fiefore he came to me 
 precious busy i call him when will
 i come and be forgiven what does
 she mean does she believe-what does
 i she believe anyway im going down
 i to tell her the truth she can take it or
 let it alone but shes got at least to
 hear that i wasnt skylarking around
 with a pair of pseudo-chorus girls be-
 fore id left her an hour

   the day with its interruptions of re-

	porters of machinists of detectives and
 what not wore on five oclock found
 him again at the ramsays ite had no

 	sooner entered than the buzz from the
drawing-rooms warned him that airs

 ramsays tea for the titled poultry-
 farmer was in full blast ite hesita-
ted looked about to beat a retreat but

	bootson stayed him

 mtss agatha sir is in her boudoir
shes not feeling well enough to be
jdown-stairs but she is receiving a
few friends there she told me totell
you bootson looked discreetly able
to believe in the few friends stocky
made his way up the stairs past the
ilibrary on the front of the second floor
nip another flight to agathas own

	bower overlooking the square with its
fountain its young green leaves its

children and nurses put there were
candle-light anti lamplight in her room
and at his entrance she pulled the cur-
tains across the view of the square
she was a little pale and her eyes had
delicate blue shadows under them he
had never been in this room before
and it with its flowers and hangings
and cushions either slightly smothered
him or the sight of her

  she shook her head at him slowly
gracefully mockingly intimately

  oh oh mr john randolph
brown she scoffed but in the most
melting tones stockv stood at atten-
tion he did not know what this fore-
boded he felt indefinably hurt by it

  and  have always believed you
such a pillar of ice she taunted him
still in that honey-sweet alluring voice
see how stupid i was you were ice
only because my poor attractions -she
spread her hands wide and rtood be-
fore him in all her grace and beauty-
my poor attractions did not tempt
you

  the perfume from her hair and from
the flowers in the room the daintiness
and charm of all her appointments
the hlue and gold and white that
seemed to hold her as a beautiful case
holds a beautiful gem all smote upon
him at the same instant but with ter-
ror rather than with fascination

  wait a minute he said harshly
you must not believe that rotten -tuft
in the paper this morning-

  ah but my little bird shall i not
believe that she stepped nearer and
spoke with a mimicry of his own voice
im here in the hundred and twen-
ty-sixth street station with howitzer
and two women-bubble busted come
and bail me out shant i believe that
either

  he stared at her dully

  oh dont be such an owl she cried
petulantly dont you suppose i like
you all the better for having a spice of
the devil in you-if you care anything
about my liking you she ended provo-
catively she knew well enough how
nearly she had broken down his bar-
riers the afternoon before surely now
-now that she ktfew him not impec-


the vopulacr magazine

cable now that lie knew her not a se-
vere goddess-

  you dont understand said stocky-
thickly you-give me credit i dont
deserve it was all an accident  can
explain it to you

  so youre still a good boy dear
me and i havent found a fellow vic-
tim of amiable human weaknesses in
you yet her voice bad grown bit-
ter she looked at him with eves bright
with mortification then she laughed
a high-pitched reckless laugh

  pray dont be so serious she
begged theres no tragedy at all
im not the victim of an unreciprocated
ardor for you mr john randolph
brown  le made a gesture of repu-
diation to tell you the truth  am
only an experimenter  have-and
very unwomanly you will doubtless
think it of me-a wager with edward
as o the possibility of tempting you
from your icy attitude having once
-well i thought i should win the
wager however ive lost edward
will hugh at me he knew your per-
fections better than i we arc to be
married in june he will want you
to usher for him but he will laugh
at my failure

  stocky strode a step forward he
caught her in his arms and held her
close and hard against him pic kissed
her face her hair with hard brutal
kisses

  there  he cried when he let her
go flushed disheveled breathless he
will not laugh at you now perhaps
and he was gone before she could
frame a word

xviii

  two days later the news that the
date had been set for the nuptials of
miss agatha ramsay daughter etc
etc heiress etc etc daring original
etc etc was duly promulgated
through the public prints the list of
bridesmaids was given out and the list
of ushers a discreet biography of
the expectant groom also appeared i us
remarkable suc-< --i•> in law and finance
were chronicled hie fact that miss

ramsays trousseau was to be exclu-
sively of american manufacture was
sounded praisefully stocky read the
laudatory fulsome paragraphs with
loathing and disgust he hated himself
fur what he had done for it had not
even been a surrender to his own pas-
ion to her charm it had been the mark
of his contempt for her and her lures
it had been his insulting seal of his rec-
ognition of her promiscuity but he
fell himself more degraded by that in-
sult to her than he had degraded her

  one thing had befallen him which
but for the sick taste of the boudoir
episode upon his palate might have in-
vigorated him he had received-a let-
ter from crystal

  some one has sent me a silly newspaper

with a garbled story of you in it i am so
glad you were not hurt as lor the other
stuff you know that i dont believe a word
of what it implies you sec i have this 
advantage over your new york friends-i
have lived with you on the hills and i know
how impossible that sort ofthing would be 
to you	

  that was like her-fine and straight
and outspdken but how little she knew
him she would probably not believe
that he could have insulted a woman as i
he had insulted agatha ramsay how
little she knew him after all ca- j
rousing with those poor painted make- 
believe chorus girls would have been a
white thing compared to degrading the
woman to whom he had given his boys 
first love and ardor oh he was a
brute and a beast thank heaven the
company was to be incorporated soon
and he could get away from this hate-
ful town 

  then came a note from agatha y

  f you wish to offer me any reparation for
your insult you will do what edward asks

 that was all what was edward
going to ask was he going to call
him out to a duel 

  on the contrary edward had no
more gory purpose in view than to in-
vite him to be best man at the wed-
ding

  youre agathas friend as well as
mine said the lawyer looking at him
out of sleepy-lidded eyes neither of
stocky bkown

 us has a brother-my brother-over-the-
 left would scarcely do for saint bar-
 tholomews eh so do it if you can
 old man agathas as keen on it as i
  am

   what perversion of natural feeling
 should make her so stocky wondered
  but llie command of her note was laid
 upon him he found himself telling
 winterleigh how proud and pleased he
 would be winterleigh repeated his

 -	words to agatha that evening

    i suppose youll like to hear that it
  will be torture to him lie observed
 lazily women are apaches for tor-
 ture lie must have been harder hit
  than i have imagined lately well
 heaven bless him i like to see him
 writhe a bit myself-in payment for
 the time i imagined you had a penchant
 for his eyes or his shoulders or some-
 thing agatha laughed

    silly she said endearingly

    so the busy days went on until the

 	end of may was upon them miss
 ramsay who liked the public attention
 riveted upon herself without competi-
 tors had selected the first day of june
 for her bridal itll take the wind out
 of all later sails she thought content-

  edly she hated what she was doing
  in one way  she did not love the man

 	she was going to marry and the fasci-
  nation he had had for her at first was
 z evaporated into thin air but she was
  in for it and he was bound to be a
  figure of importance in the community

  that was something and he wouldnt

 	expect impossible flights of goodness
 i from her-he wouldnt want them oh

  it was an ignoble match enough but it
 would answer or if it didnt-she

 -	shrugged her shoulders marriage was

 	easily evaded nowadays

    there had been a final rehearsal on
 t the second evening before the cere-
 imony and after it a bridesmaid-and-
  usher jollification at the washington

 	square house agatha would not be
  married in the country i want the
 t mob the police and all she said

 finally it was all over and the party
 i had separated

   in her big room with the louis
 seize boudoir opening out of it she

accepted the ministrations of her maid
with perfunctory gratitude afterward
the maid told the other servants that
never had she seen a young lady ap-
proach her own wedding with so little
excitement it wasnt just that she
wasnt excited observed the abigail
she wasnt even interested like

  the maid hovering around the
bride-to-be with the attentions which
brides-to-be always command from all
womankind finally drew up the cover-
lids and turned out the light and tip-
toed off agatha lay still in the dark-
ness and felt upon her once more the
strange baleful eyes of the man who
was to be her husband in-in less than
thirty-six hours now she was op-
pressed by sudden fear of him he
was so sure of her-so sure of himself
of his power over her perhaps after
all he would not be so easy to keep in
subjugation or to throw off as she had
imagined

  in the darkness the sense of dread
kept growing upon her she tried for
a long time to sleep but she could not
she turned on the light upon her read-
ing-stand and picked up herbedside
book-it was a morbid novel of the
drug-liabit she closed it again with a
shudder of repulsion for she saw her-
self experimenting some day with the
new excitement of narcotics becoming
their slave and finally living the life and
dying the death of the woman in that
dreadful tale she caught up another
-but it was a volume of decadent
french verse she thought she saw the
eyes of her future husband smiling
mockingly upon her and taunting her
with her intellectual tastes and refuges
and while the taunting smile held her
there came a gradual change over the
face in her vision the smile vanished
the eyes were frozen a snarl of hatred
and terror distorted the cruel lips she
screamed and pulled violently at the
bell next her bed

  pier maid came running to ljer-the
bell communicated at the head of her
bed with the servants quarters she
found the girl cowering and sobbing
hysterically

  laws me miss agatha she ex-


the pqlpular magazine

claimed whats the matter is there
any one moving below in the library
or have yon been havin a bad dream
poor dear-

  that it thats it sobbed agatha
oh such a frightful dream blossom
blossom you must stay here the rest of
the night you must sleep here

  and it was on the serving-womans
kindly shoulder and to the monotonous
soothing of her there there poor
lamb there there poor lamb that the
bride-elect finally fell  leep

  dora mr ramsay stood at his
wifes bedside in the morning light and
shook her b the shoulder mrs ram-
say her face swathed in bands de-
signed to prevent the sagging of mus-
cles sleepily opened her eyes

  whats the matter gordon what
do you want at this unearthly hour
what time is it she turned fretful-
ly to the clock on the stand this is
outrageous she declared with vigor
its not seven and you know how late

i got tobed and-

  oh for kds sake stop that in-
terrupted her spouse in a shaking
voice and wake up dora and try
to be a woman

  something in his manner made her
spring up she faced him affrightedly

  what is it is agatha-

  agathas all right-yet but theres
terrible news in store for her are you
ready 

  go on -

winterleigh has been murdered
she sat perfectly still lor a second
her face in its grotesque hands grow-
ing whiter than the pillows behind her

  how do you know she asked
finally in a wooden voice

  his man has just called me on the
telephone to tell me

  it-how was-some one who owed
him a grudge some convict

  no-a woman

  a woman

  that is all grimes is sure of i
have telephoned for doctor hamil to
go with me when i get there i will

see what is to be done and will send

out-my god dora how will agatha

take it 

they looked at each other with

frightened eyes

 will let her sleep as long as possi-
ble- she will need all her strength to

meet the shock go now gordon 
shall go down into agathas den and
be there when she wakes call me on
the telephone the instant you know

anything more gordon

  lie had started toward the door nqd-
diug he turned ljack at her call

  youre sure it was a woman xot
a man-not any man agatha had
treated badly letty told me-the
other week-some time-about young
browns having bten here for an hour
in her boudoir and going out without
stopping for my tea-and he was never
here again until last night you arc 
sure-hes so reckless-gambler-

those women-

  dont let your imagination run
away with you dora ramsay pat-
ted his wifes shoulder grimes was j
certain it was a woman evidently 
there was no attempt at concealment
well-oh its unutterable anyway j
but this is ncy quite what that would i
be

  agatha awoke at eleven through 
the sapphire hangings at her door she
beheld her mother in her dressing- j

room

  ah mama dearest you are here
to greet the lovely bride but its not j
until to-morrow is it or have i slept 
through  i feel rested enough for any-
thing why mother for her moth-
er had entered and was standing by
her bed-her mother uiunassaged and
unmarceled with drawn gray face and
stricken eyes what is it the girl
whispered

  you will be brave my darling
  yes yes-only hurry

  edward-oh my dear how can i
mother go on dont try me like j
this what is the matter with ed-
ward 

  for three hours the poor mother j
had been framing words and sentences 
to break the force of the blow to her
stocky brown



daughter but now all that she could
say was

   edward was murdered last night

   agathas rosy face blanched last
night last night she cried oh
then it was that i saw-it was that i
saw

   she stared at her mother out of un-
seeing eyes of terror and kept repeat-
ing the words by and by she ex-
plained the dream she had had

  but now do you tell me she
added with a sort of awful composure
how it happened

 it seems from papers which she
left that it was a woman who-who
thought she had a claim against him
your father says that if half which the
papers declare is true-the documents
she left-he was-oh my darling i
say it to help you-he was a monster
if they are true but they are prob-
ably lies

   i dont think so said agatha medi-
tatively he was a perfectly un-
scrupulous man-and very able who
was the woman 

   a westerner it seems from that
god-forsaken place where he came
from but my darling do not ask any
more questions see here is your
i breakfast on a tray can you eat any-
 jiing dear try for all our sakes

   it was one of the most amazing and
n the whole one of the most dread-
ful experiences of mrs ramsays life
hat her daughter did try and did suc-
ceed in eating her breakfast that morn-
ng when her lover the man who was
o have been her husband in another
lav lay dead with a bullet in his head
i mile away from them

   the newspapers of the next few days
-with which it appeared later grimes
nad held pecuniary conversation before
cle phoning mr ramsay-told very
ompletely with proofs and clever sur-
juises the story of what had happened
winterleigh had gone home after the

	rehearsal-supper to his rooms in the
-omaha apparently the woman had
obtained entrance to them during his

absence the liall-bov had a dim rec-
ollection of having admitted a small
queer-looking woman to the building
early in the evening no elevator-boy
recalled having carried her up to win-
terleighs apartment on the eighth floor
so she had apparently watched her
chance and slipped up the stairway
when the elevators were in transit
how she gained admission to the apart-
ment was a mystery for some time un-
til the superintendent recognized her
picture as the likeness of a woman who
had looked for an apartment three days
before and who had maneuvered to be
left alone with his key-ring tor a few
minutes while he went down to attend
to some urgent matter in the engine-
room it so happened that he never
missed his skeleton key until after the
murder when he put two and two to-
gether for the benefit of the detectives

  she had apparently waited in the
rooms until winterleigh had come in
and had gone to bed she must have
hidden in a clothes- closet in the pri-
vate hall for grimes who had waited
up for his employer had seen no sign
of her then when winterleigh had
gone to bed but not to sleep for the
cigar he had evidently been smoking
was not half burned out she had crept
in upon him his wras not the face of a
man done to death while he slept peace-
fully but of a man who with loathing
and hatred has seen death approach
him well she had crept in and had
shot him in the temple before he could
leap from his bed although he had evi-
dently started up his body lay side-
ways where it had fallen back from a
half-erect position

  then turning her back upon him
she had carefully and with a sort of
dreadful humor in her exactness laid
out the documents that would prove
her connection with the case there
were the newspaper clippings foretell-
ing his wedding there were old
stray paragraphs concerning his legal
successes east and west there were
letters to her dated a dozen years be-
fore-to his dear girl his sweet-
heart his bride his wife  there
were letters to others-to seth adams


thu pocpular magazine

and to mrs adam-commanding this
and that to be done by and by there
were letters without beginning or end
typewritten on a blue paper which
stocky when he saw the awful exhibits
a b c and the rest recognized at
last-the paper of winterleigh s office
whoever wrote those letters was the
wonderful leader of a gang of despera-
does planning their outrages for them
sharing their booty promising help
when necessary to his deputy i hat
deputy was one man the others were to
believe that the schemes had their origin
in the deputys brain no one was to
know of the master mind weaving
crimes providing for the remotest con-
tingencies of crime in an airy new
york office the murderess wrote in
the one document she left in her own
handwriting

 but all the lime i was there years and
ye rs ago he had loved mo and made me
hi slave as he made all his slave that he
wanted he had ruined me and left me
first to denver he went-and used from
there to promise to return to me then to
chicigo and said i should soon join him
but i was always listening and i robbed
my brother-in-laws pockets and learned
things that way then he went to new
york he sent a boy out to us that he
wanted to have killed but the boy did a
good turn to my brother-in-laws mother and
so my brother-in-law would not kill him
then i tried to hoping to win my husband
back again by services-for he was my hus-
band but they frightened me with stories
of what he would do to me then he wanted
money and wrote to us to iob the fiero
mine superintendent and they did-the gang
and then the boy he wanted killed said he
was going to marry a girl in new york
so  told the sheriff of the robbery and all
the crimes and how be planned them but
no one believed that i led the posse to
the place in the mountains he himself had
shown me where we had camped together
he and i when he first married me-for he
did marry me and where he had shown
me the one secret way up the old narrow
ravine to the top of the cliff but lie got
them all off with sharp lawyers and i was
very weary and so far away i could do no
more my sifter and thy brother-in-law took
me with them to the coat i could never
get away from their spying so i knew he
had told them never i  let me get loose of
them so i went out in a boat first hiding
boys clothes and some money in a place i
knew and i fixed the boat to upset with
my hat and coat to float upon the water
so that my sister and brother-in-law thought

trtfi drowned and did not look for me ta

land and i put on the boys clothes-i
am small and thin and light in mv motion 
like a boy-and  made my way from them
and i he papers  bought said he was going i
to be married and one a foolish thng j
about how bachelors keep house old i
me where he lived and how so  got hcrt 
ind resumed my womans clothes a few day 
ago now i know bow his apartmqit lies i
and where he sleep i know when he is tq
be married but he shall not be for i shall 
k ii him and then i sliall go drown myself 
indeed i do not want to live after he is 
dead	bahbajia mejtmrr  j

  and after the two weeks wonder i
and scandal this came to-be accepted 
as the true history of the life and death 
of edward winterleigh some matter- i
of-fact persons never believed any of it 
except that the great lawyer died at j
the hands of an insane woman whose 
body was afterward recovered in the
north river some imaginative per-
sons on the other hand made winter-
leigh organizer of all the crimes com- i
mitted east and west for a decade be- i
fore agatha ramsay went abroad as
soon as possible that her scattered
nerves might be restored at the german j
springs she eventually married a i
french gentleman of high title and an-
cient lineage whose temperament prom-
ised her all the excitement she could j
conveniently manage and at last re-
ports she was more of a parisienne than
any native

  there was a golden light all over the
plain on which mimosa stood the
dusty stretch was shot through and 
through with color from the setting
sun a girl slim erect slight rode
a pony back and forth beside the sta-
tion-platform her eyes beneath the
sharply defined black eyebrows were 
clear pools of deep light her olive skin
had red in it her lips were red health
and some joyful expectation lit up her
glowing countenance now and then
she stopped to pat a horse picketed at
one end of the station

  when the train drew in she soothed
her restive pony with gentle strokes

a man came running around the end
stocky brown

  of the station-stocky his tan lost by
  ten months in the east but his eyes
  eager and bright

    crystal he cried oh crystal
 he caught her hand and all words
 failed him

   stocky dear dear friend she
 said he reared his head

    if thats all you can make it crys-
tal i wont come any farther lie said
you cant be friends with me its
all or nothing now i wrote you that
--you knew

    she looked at him tenderly from the
 i superior height of her horses back

    i think she said honestly and slow-
  ly that that was the reason i made
  you wait so long to sec me and then



made you see me here i wanted you
to take time stocky and be sure

  im sure are you

  she smiled with divine tenderness on
him and nodded

  ive been sure ever since your box
of laurels came that time till then id
never thought about you that way
then-then  did-and ve known
since then stocky

  he received the benediction of her
deep eyes bem on him as though it
were a stream of healing and cleansing
as well as of joy then he mounted
the horse she had brought down for
him and together they rode along the
dusty street of the town to where the
green of the parbonage showed

depth to which divers can descend

rvhe depth to which a diver can descend would appear to be limited by his
  power for withstanding the adverse influences acting upon him while
carrying on his duties under water apparently a descent of thirty
 fathoms-io feet-of water marks the limit of safety for even the few divers
who possess the necessary physical fitness in combination with a disregard for
c danger beyond the average records in deep-sea diving have to be accepted with
the proverbial grain of salt we are told that a diver lias reached thirty-three
fathoms and a half while engaged in salvage operations recently on the west

	zoast of south america and yet again another diver working on the same
vwreck is reported to have brought up three bars of copper from  depth of forty
ifathoms at the expense of his life an expert who has superintended a large
number of diving operations has found that very few men whatever their build
arc capable of combating the severe strain which is brought to bear upon their
physical energies for a few minutes at a depth of twenty or thirty fathoms many
of his divers dared not venture below ten fathoms of  divers employed
iat greater depths thirty were seriously injured and the result was fatal in ten
instances

 the town of kipling has just blossomed out in canada where there is only

to be interested in the character of hector alonzo mcgrath hector is in a

hector by an act of self-sacrifice saves the day at the last

fast freight had been
derailed with such dis-
astrous results that a
dozen cars of merchan-
dise were heaped and
strewn piecemeal
across both lines of
track the early aft-
ernoun express bound to cape may had
been halted by this chaotic barricade
and its passengers poured forth in an
irritable swarm to bombard the wreck-
ing-crews with asinine questions the
red-faced sweating foreman sputtered
poor consolation from the deck of a
derrick-car 

  ye can see wid your own two eyes
that tis lucky well be if we get this
mt  cleared away by sunset now run
of and lave me be me titnper is
frazzled entirely

  in the face of this forceful admoni-
tion to mind his own business a slender
well-groomed young man of cheerful
demeanor sauntered nearer the irate
foreman and offered him a most excel-
lent cigar with the mild query

   are we really stuck here for four
or five hours  dont mean to be a
nuisance but there is a girl in cape
may and she takes it for granted that
i never arrive anywhere on time she
wont blame the railroad for this she
will say it wun all my carelessness 

want to rush a telegram through to her 

and try to square myself

  the foreman grinned mopped his 
face with his shirt-sleeve and quite 
amiably returned

  if the ties aint tore up too bad we
may get your train through in three 
hours or so me boy ye can wire the 
gurrl on the word of peter omara j
tliat for once ye are unavoidably de- j
tained

  thank you kindly mr ohara i
will wander up the nearest road and i
chat with the natives if this wilderness 
happens to be populated replied hec- 
tor alonzo mcgrath my fellow suf- j
ferers back yonder make me tired they j
ought to be grateful that their own j
train isnt smeared all over the new
jersey landscape instead oi cursing j
themselves black in the face over what 
cant be helped

  with ibis philosophic finale young
mr mcgrath of yale betook himself l
to the grade-crossing beyond the wreck j
and turned into the country highway j
which made a white streak through the 
sparse and sandy woodland the pros-
pect offered little promise of natural  -
beauty or wayside diversion but the
explorer footed it resolutely hoping to i
discover some sign of farm or hamlet
to awaken his idle interest the mid-  i
summer heat was tempered by a lively 
a case of professionalism



  wind which blew from the eastward
   with the breath of ocean in its salty
  tang and before long- this casual way-
  farer discerned a strip of marsh and
  the cool glint of a small tidewater river
  presently the road turned toward a
  ramshackle wooden bridge and just be-
  yond it mcgrath saw a low-roofed
  weather-worn farmhouse lie was hot
  and thirsty and desirous of resting in
  the shade of the ancient trees which
  guarded the dooryard of this humble
   dwelling

    it is the old homestead right out
  of a book observed young mcgrath
  to himself ten to one the moss-cov-
   ered bucket hangs in the well and
  it wouldnt surprise me one bit to see
  a blue-jeans quartet file out of the barn-
  yard take the center of the stage and
  sing close harmony they may take
  me for a sewing-machine agent and
  throw me into the creek but  am go-
  ing to make a social call all the same

    he crossed the bridge turned into
  the dooryard among beds of prim old-
  f fashioned flowers and waited on the
  gray stone step for some response to
  his pull at the jingling bell-wire in
  his last year at yale as yet unac-
  quainted with the sensation of earning
  a dollar by dint of his own exertions

i this hector alonzo mcgrath pursued
his light-hearted and whimsical way
with small knowledge of what the
-struggle for existence meant to the
 world beyond the campus gates to
cone older and wiser than he this small
gray cottage its tottering outbuildings
its patched and unpainted barns and
its rudely fenced fields would have
- been eloquent of years of unremitting
jtoil to hold poverty at arms length to
 the young collegian they were agree-
cably picturesque and nothing more

    presently there appeared in the hall
 a woman of middle age ruddy of
cheek brisk of footfall with the kind-
f liest friendliest eyes which smiled a
f brave cheerfulness her hair was
 grayer than it ought to have been and
 there were more wrinkles about those
j honest cordial eyes than was meet for
her years as if life on this wide-swept
meager farm liad been something other

than merely picturesque as she smi-
lingly replied to hectors courteous pe-
tition she smoothed imaginary wrinkles
from an immaculate white apron which
obviously hail been snatched up and
donned in haste

  why of course you can have all
the water you want to drink young
man the well is in the side yard ill
bring you a pitcher and glass or i can
show you the way to the pump
hector hastily voiced his preference
for the pump and his hostess led him
along a graveled path and through a
densely covered grape-arbor fashioned
of bits of spars which must have
washed ashore from the sea toward
which the wandering river led past the
doorway the random caller drank his
fill from the gourd that hung beside the
pump-handle and was so evidently
loath to depart that she suggested
why dont you sit down in the
grape-arbor and get cooled off it
must be dreadful hot and dusty walk-
in i hear there was a smash-up on
the railroad did you come past it
 belong in the cape may express
that is waiting for the railroad to be
put together again it is much nicer
to be here than blistering over there
on the track replied the bold invader
please dont let me bother you you
can leave me here with perfect safety
mrs-er-i do not know your name
mine is mcgrath

   mrs harriet trent and i am glad
to meet you said she as they sought
the shade of the curtaining grape-
vines it is selfish for me to think of
my own disappointments and i ought
to be thankful nobody was killed but
i had my heart set on goin over to
oakville this afternoon and i under-
stand theres no trains runninv
how far is it to oakville asked
hector with genuine sympathy for the
smiling face of mrs trent could not
dissemble the note of wistful regret
in her voice

   its only a mile by train and two
miles by horse or afoot she explained
my son went over this morning and
he counts on seeing me there by three
oclock he is in the athletic games


the cpocpular magazine

at the county-fair grounds ami it s the
first time he has tried to run arid jump

against first-rate grown-up athletes i
feel pretty sure that arthur can win
without me but we ort of looked for-
ward to this for same time and i
am just too tired to walk that far

  i lector alohxo mcgrath smote his
knee and declared with exuberant en-
thusiasm 

  athletic games why mrs trent
i dote on em all kinds at any time
 am a strident at yale and i have
tried to make every team in the col-
lege for three years straight without
the slightest success but  am just as
keen about it as ever please tell me
some more about your son

  mrs harriet trent was beaming as
she gazed into the ingenuous coun-
tenance of this attractive stranger and
replied with a zest to match his own

  why id give most anything to
have arthur meet you mr mcgrath
so m are really in yale college he
w uk just love to talk to you he is
 i g to enter princeton cc gs this
fall -ow  hat do you think of that of
course you are surprised but it is as rue
as im sittin here he seldom gets a
chance to talk to college students like
you when he was a little boy i was
dreadfully afraid he would want to go
to sea like his father that was lost in
his own schooner six ears ago next
november but he took to books in-
stead got it straight from his grand-
father trent and has talkea about go-
in away to college ever since he was
twelve years old it aint been easy
but he went to the oakville high school
off and on and studied all summers
long and now hes really and truly
passed hi- examinations for princeton
college

  she paused nervously twisted a cor-
ner of the white apron and resumed
with an abashed and slightly troubled
air

  i just run on till im clean out of
breath dont i and me a perfect
stranger to you you must think im
odd but folks around here dont un-
derstand what my son is drivinrat

  i love to hear you talk mrs trent

seriously returned ileclor cant i
persuade this fine son of yours to go to

yale ye want that kind of men at

new haven

i wouldnt say anything against
yale college for worlds she protected j

but arthur wont listen toanythin

but princeton it was a young prince- 
ton professor duck-shootin down here j

five years ago that put the bee in j
arthurs bonnet and hes never thought
of an other place since

  but how will ou get along without j
him can you run the farm alone 
have you any other children

 nobody but arthur and her 
brave eyes were sad he will be home j
summers and vacations lo look after 
things and ill make out somehow 
dont worry about that he wouldnt
go away if he thought i was goin to 
suffer he is goin to work his way
through college and if he prospers and
finds jobs enough maybe  can go to 
princeton and stay a vhile in the win-
ters we dont lorrow trouble nor 
cross bridges till we come to em

  great scott we have forgotur at
about those athletic games exefc itrol
hector glancing at his water  
a arse you are going over to oakville 
right now cant we charter a horse 
and buggy  i have plenty of time to

ends it though i thank vcu for yotir j
interest in me mr mcgrath you cer- i
tainly are good-hearted and wi-meafc- j
in	

  hector pricked up his ears at thij
sound of wheels rattling across the j
bridge darting madly through the i
gale he was in time to hail a carrot- i
topped youth driving a grocers wagon i
piled high with berry-crates to hec-
tors miiporiunities he red-headed cre j
made this crushing rejoinder	-j

 doesnt it calmly commented the
 other dump those crates in the yard
 here and right about face i need your
 wagon

   the peppery lad began to toss his
 cargo overboard without another word
 and despite her vehement protests at
 such unheard-of extravagance mrs
 harriett trent was fairly kidnaped by
 her energetic guest and whisked to-
 ward oakville in a cloud of dust hec-
 tor banished the boy to the back of the
 wagon and handled reins and whip
 with such skill that the journey was
 made at breakneck spjeed mrs trent
 clung to his arm and maintained a
 courageous composure while he learned
 more and more from her confiding
 revelations how unconsciously heroic
 how pregnant with loving sacrifices
 and how fired with noble ambition had
 been the long struggle toward the goal
 of the chief desire of this mother and
 her son together they had wrought
 a miracle of zeal and faith and works

	in wresting success from adversity
 nor could hector mcgrath find room
 in his heart for doubt that arthur
 trent would somehow fight his way
 through four years of college

   when the grocers chariot clattered
 into the straggling outskirts of oak-
 ville the joyful noise of a villainous
 brass band welled from the fenced en-
  closure of the county-fair grounds the
 gates were plastered with posters whose
  rampant type proclaimed 

grand athletic carnival

  under the management of the

oakville a a
fourteen championship
events

gold and silver medals
and

 in prizes

   tf this young trent expects to get
 into college athletics he must not be
 competing for money thought hector
 flwith a start of dismay it will queer
 him as sure as a shot with all the fussy
 rules against professionalism even if
 rhe wins only a ten-cent piece doesnt

	lie know any better if he doesnt i

ought to warn him its the only de-
cent thing to do whoa dobbin

  but hector did not wish to give the
doling mother cause for worry and it
would be foolish of him to raise a fale
alarm of course arthur trent must
know enough to avoid spoiling his
chances of an athletic career at prince-
ton by steering clear of competing for
cash prizes at this picayune country
meeting it was the comfortablehabit
of hector mcgrath to let well enough
alone and to meet disagreeable issues
by deftly stepping around them so he
temporized kept his reflections to him-
self and escorted mrs trent  a seal
in the flimsy grand stand overlooking
the trotling-traek and bascball-field on
which runners jumpers and weight-
tossers were strenuously disporting
themselves the scene was like a
caricature of the pretentious college-
athletic meetings at which hector was
wont to cheer himself purple of coun-
tenancfe but he had the true sporting
spirit which finds iis enjoyment in the
contest itself and he was prepared to
be thrilled regardless of environment
or record-breaking finishes

  near the take-off for the running
broad jump stood a group of awkward
sunburned young rustics clad in mot-
ley home-made athletic costumes
somewhat apart from them making
ready for a trial leap was a youth of
different mold there was no trace
of the muscle-bound clumsiness of the
farmer or the slovenly carriage of the
factory-hand in his graceful confident
manner of handling himself trimly
and compactly built he appeared to
possess both strength and fleetness in
an uncommon degree the combination
of qualities seen in the successful half-
back or end-rush of the college foot-
ball-field as he launched into his
stride and gathered himself for the
jump hector said aloud

  he certainly makes those clodhop-
pers look outclassed by jove he is a
corker

  that is my son arthur cried mrs
trent her voice a trifle unsteady with
excitement oh do you think he can
win 


the populjr magazine

  he cant help it he is a natural-
born athlete stoutly affirmed hector
why oli why didnt a yale professor
have sense enough to shoot docks down
here and bag that boy of yours when
he was young

   i am sure lie will come over and sec
us as soon as lie can mr mcgrath i
dont believe he knows im here

  a few minutes later a pompous vil-
lage worthy bellowed huskily through
a megaphone that a trent had won
the broad jump distance twenty-two
feet nine inches breaking the record
of the oakville athletic association by
a hull foot the victor waved a joy-
ous greeting- to his elated mother and
was about to run across the interven-
ing track when the perspiring gentle-
man of the megaphone roared

  all out for the quarter-mile run
take your places at the start

  mrs trent clasped her hands and
breathlessly confided to hector

  this is the race arthur wants to
win most of all the first prize is ten
dollars and he needs just that much
more to put in the savings-bank to pay
his bill for tuition before he can get
into college it has been worry in him
lately and he wont have me deny my-
self any more than he can help do
you suppose he can run faster than
those big hearty men some of em
years older than arthur there must
be a dozen of em

  im willing to bet ten dollars on
him against the field was hectors
prompt reply but he ought not to
be running for money in this race i
ought to go over and talk to him no
its too late they are lined up on the
mark oh i have no business to let
him do it he doesnt know any bet-
ter i-i--

   yyhat in the world is the matter with
you anxiously asked the mother
 re you afraid he cant win the race
is he doing anything he hadnt ought
to 

   the starters pistol cracked and t he
bunch of runners shot away from the
quarter-pole of the trottiug-track it
was too late to intervene and inwardly
lamenting his procrastination and lack

of decision hector eould qftlv stam-
mer 

  i-i was only thinking  might give

him some useful advice for the race i
know a lot about this kind of sport
mrs trent of course he is going tj
win look how easily he runs he 
is going to set the pace all the way 
he would make the hest of them hustle
on a good track

  at the end of the first hundred
yards arthur trents rivals were i
pounding heavily in his wake and when
half the distance had been covered they i
were strung out in a hopeless proccs- i
sion sprinting as though this were no
more than a hundred-yard dash the
sw ift-footed youth tore down the home-
stretch of the track head up striding
powerfully a winner in such easy fash-
ion that he seemed to be running for
his own diversion

  lie could have stopped to pick
daisies or turn handsprings down the
middle of the track and won as he
pleased declared hector mcgrath 
who was dancing a jig and pounding 
the railing with his costly straw hat
he dont expect to have any time j
for athletic games in college and i
dont know but what im sorry aftei 
seem him do so fine murmured mrs
trent with a sigh of relief that the
intolerable suspense war ended

  arthur trent wheeled from the track 
and vaulting the barrier of the grand j
stand grasped his mothers outstretched
hands her eyes were shining as she j
told him

  it was just splendid i am  proud j
of you i low many more races did you 
win before i come

  the shot-put and the hurdle j
mother laughed the panting lad j
four championships and  have earned 
twenty dollars in all just think of 
that and ten dollars of it belongs to 
you for a birthday present it was lots j
of fun i am going to make a try at j
the last event too thats the mile j
run its great to have you here

  as he surveyed the manly resolute j
face of young trent hector could not
bring himself to say a belated word j
about professionalism in college j
a case of iprofessionalism	si

 sport it was too late to mend mat-
 ters and bo moodily looked at bis watch
 i he must hurry away if he expected to
 rejoin the cape may express offer-
 ing bis hand to arthur trent he said
 sincerely

 late you it was great work your

   after a blithesome care-free summer
 hector alonzo mcgrath returned to
 mew haven to enjoy the dignified sta-
 ion and manifold responsibilities of a
 vale senior he found the football-
  quad hard at work under the leader-
 ship of jim stearns and promptly
 offered himself as a candidate for any
 position from guard to quarter-back
 a i th more candor than tact the out-
 spoken captain informed him

   you have tried for the eleven for

 	hree years i lector and you never
 came as close to it as fifteenth substi-
 tute i dont want the unpleasant job
 f firing yoft from the squad so be a
 jod boy and roll hoops or play mar-
 bles until the chess season opens it
 s a cinch you can make the intercol-
 legiate chess-team this year if you dont
 overtrain or sprain your thinker

   i had a notion you might want a
 ood plunging half-back jim but
 ieyer mind was hectors meek retort
 ryou will regret it when your team is
 whipped yale has never appreciated
 ne but i wont be sore on you you
 ure a part of the system you cant
 vielp it

   go chase yourself or i shall turn you
 over my knee and proceed to wallop
 you declared the football captain as

he called his men from the training-
house to the field for the opening line-
up of the season hector mcgrath
found an outlet for his single-minded
devotion in watching the daily prac-
tise cheering the good pi a  and ri-
ding back to the campus with the tired
and muddy athletes as the season
wore on he continued to be a loyal
heeler whom tine wort weather could
not dismay he trotted out to the field
with unflagging interest elated when
the work of the first eleven was encour-
aging depressed and volubly worried
when the scrub was able to score a
touch-down or kick a field-goal in
fact he seemed to carry a heavier bur-
den of responsibility upon his ratlur
frail shoulders than did his friend and
classmate jim stearns the captain

  the preliminary or practise-games
played again- college teams of no great
prowess were satisfactory to the yale
coaches the eleven was strong fast
and slowly developing unity of action
as the weeks of october slipped past
and the shadow of the geat contest
with princeton began to fall athwart
the yale field so great was the con-
fidence of hector mcgrath in the win-
ning abilities of jim stearns brawny
hard-driven young men that he began
to overhaul his cash resources with a
view to backing his faith with more
substantial proofs he had no intention
of risking utter bankruptcy in the event
of defeat however until an ill-fated
impulse moved him to visit new york
early in november as a relaxation from
the strain of lectures and recitations
although his instructors might have dis-
agreed with his opinion that he stood
in need of any recuperation of the
kind

  in the crowrded lobby of a preten-
tious fifth avenue hotel hector en-
countered one aspinwall smythe a
young man affecting loud garments
and a manner of speech even louder
hector had made his acquaintance in
preparatory school after which the
disgusting smythe person as he
called him had somehow pass-d the
barriers of princeton and there main-
tained a precarious foothold throuii
	the popular magazine

freshman year and then the campus
knew him no more notwithstanding
the brevity of his career as an under-
graduate and his compulsory retirement
from the shades of old nassau aspin-
wall smythe was a blatantly aggressive
partisan of princeton unusually erup-
tive on the eve of the foot ball-match
with yale when he flourished large
bundles of his inherited wealth under
the noses of such yale men as he
chanced lo meet in public places and
offered to bet them  a standstill
hector mcgrath was accustomed to
say of this pet aversion of his

  aspinwall smythe is tlie only real
grievance  have against princeton it
is no disgrace to be beaten by her fool-
ball-teams and when we whip her she
takes ii like a good sport but she cant
live aspiuwall smythe down in a
thousand years

  at this chance encounter in new
york mr smythe was flushed with
wine and he fell upon hector mcgrath
with a roar of triumph proclaiming
so iht grill-roof cafe and lobby might
hear his war-cry

  a yale man and hes my meat i
thought i bad driven them all into
their holes hello you little paper
jhrt come down to the big city to
bet three dollars on your team ive
been looking for yale money for a
week and you elis are too sandless
to bet on your own eleven w hoop
ive bluffed you all

  mcgrath eyed this fat and florid
nuisance with huge disfavor and curtly
responded 

   there i no call to make n howling
as of yourself smythe i f you want
to bet on princeton you wont have to
look any further now put up or shut
up

  with a foolish chuckle aspinwall
smythe dragged from his trousers
pocket a corpulent roll of bills and an-
nounced 

  now it i- your turn to shut up and
run back to new haven you yale
shrimp take it in a lump at even
money or leave it alone i dont bother
with pikers

  ill take it snapped hector his

checks aflame now count it ami
than i will write a check to cover it
well let the hotel safe hold the stakes j

  mr smythe appeared somewhat sub- j
dued but he dropped into a convenient
chair atfcl began to count his money j
with fumbling fingers hector me- i
grath stoo  watching him in a most
distressful frame of mind his bank- i
account was at low ebb and he had
drawn upon the paternal allowance i
three months in advance that square- j
jawed father of his who had made his f
fortune in the steel mills of pittsburg i
had a businesslike method of dealing i
even in family matters and  lector 
knew that any further appeals for suc-
cor would go unheeded until the day 
on which the next remittance fell due i
it seemed as if aspinwall smythe j
would never finish pawing over that 
harrowingly plethoric wad of bills but i
at length he grunted between puffs of j
his cigar 

  twelve hundred dollars to a cent i
now arent you sorry you met me eh

  oh pshaw you are dealing in mere 
chicken-feed i thought you were real- 
ly plunging on your team observed 
hector with desperate bravado all i
right wait until i get a blank check 
from the desk

  when this rash young man from i
 ale boarded the midnight train to new 
 faven he was in no mood for slum- 
ber for some -time he sat in a corner i
of the smoking-compartrncnt of a sleep- 
er busy with pencil and paper at 
length he said to himself with fur- 
rowed brow

   am shy jusf about five hundred of 
that fool bet and i must beat that i
check to the bank between now and i
the princeton game but i couldnt 
let that smythe swine walk all over 
me t dont think  had better try to 
touch any of the fellows they may i
want to put their spare cash on jim 
stearns team the sooner i get at the 
horrible situation and look it sternly in j
the eye the better for little hectors
nerves

  losing no time next morning in ta-i
king the war-path he first sought a 
retiring gentleman of sleek aspect
a case of professionalism



 abraham hamburger by name whose
 charitable vocation it was to respond
 to undergraduate signals of distress by
 lending them cash on personal notes for
 a modest recompense of ten per c 
 a month mr hamburger was cordial
 but unhappy as be dcciareci vvit- ges-
 tures more eloquent than his words
 my money is all out so help me
 mr mcgrath i cannot give you four
 or five hundred dollars no not before
 december but i can give you two
 hundred it will help some maybe
 hector signed a note without read-
 ing it stuffed the two hundred in his
 pocket and fled in search of another
 accommodating gentleman known as
 einstein this campus philanthropist
 purchased second-hand garments and
 had relieved many a case of acute finan-
 cial distress by his ready presence
 finding mr einstein loafing in the
 shade of an elm convenient to the
 dormitories of the old brick row
 itector grasped him by the collar and
 swiftly propelled him toward his rooms
 in lawrence hall

   i have more clothes than i need
 moses they are apt to make me proud
 and undemocratic vouchsafed hector
 as they climbed the stairs come up
 and look em over

   without further parley the owner of
 the superfluous raiment bolted into his
 rooms and began to toss overcoats
 evening clothes riding-breeches and
 tweeds on divan window-seat and
 chairs chanting meanwhile

   every one of them as good as new
 and made by mctavish the swellest
 tailor on fifth avenue here let me
 pick out a pile for you to cast your

	vulture s eye over one suit two suits
 three suits a fur-lined coat another

i good suit a dinner-coat a lovely out-
lfit of swallow-tails oh pshaw make
 me an offer for the whole confounded
 lot

   moses was fairly licking his chops

 he had long ago noted the surpassing
j cut and fit of the clothing worn by
 hector mcgrath and now this superb
 wardrobe was fairly hurled at his head

i	too excited to haggle lie threw pru-

	dence to the winds and shouted

  one hundred and fifty dollars it i-
a big price an awful price but  will
give it fr the lot

  nothing doing you robber bel-
lowed hector but i will be a sport
and make you a counter-proposition
r will match coins with you double or
quits if  win you give me three hun-
dred for my clothes if you win you
get them for nothing

  it was a torturing decision for moses
einstein to have to make but his blood
contained a sufficient number of red
corpuscles to thrill to this sporting
challenge and after a moment of pain-
ful hesitation he faltered quite out of
breath 

  double or quits mr mcgrath
here is a couple of half-dollars i will
match you best two out of three i
am a dead-game yale sport

  the undergraduate was inwardly
aquake but he preserved a semblance
of composure w hile the lips of the agi-
tated moses einstein moved as if in
prayer the two coins rang on the
table and hector won the first round
then the skittish goddess of chance
allotted a victor to moses honors
were even and there was tense silence
as the twain slowly disclosed the coins
that lay beneath their bauds for the
third match

  i matched you and you owe me
three hundred mose whooped hec-
tor now you can run ami get an ex-
press wagon for the most luxurious
wardrobe in college me for the sim-
ple life clothes are a cursed nui-
sance

  moses wrung his hands and uplifted
his voice in heart-broken lamentation
but his sorrow failed to carry convic-
tion he had made an excellent bar-
gain after all in spite of the adverse
result of his bold hazard after his
departure hector surveyed the looted
closets with emotions of dismay and
consternation but the three hundred
dollars wrenched from mr einstein
had power to soothe and he straight-
way hastened to the bank and made
good the amount of the check that he
had so recklessly drawn to the order
of aspinwall smythe the football-


the popular magazine

team was holding its practise behind
locked gates ami hector had to way-
lay jim stearns on the campus with the
question which seethed uppermost in
his mind

  just between us jim are we all
right are the men in good shape
and do the coaches seem cheerful i
have phmged the limit bet all my cash
sold all my clothes and stand to starve
and freeze to death before christmas
if we lose the princeton game

  if you are such an ass as all that
you ought to be put in a padded cell
hector was the unexpectedly dis-
quieting reply we are going to have
to play almighty hard to win our
team is lit enough but princeton is go-
ing to turn out a great eleven this
year you are a little fool to be bet-
ting yourself blind two weeks before
the game

  wtil i hope you wontforget what
it means to hector feebly returned
the other if you lose you will have
to buy me a meal-tickct jim in my
low stae of mind you are about as
cheerful as a sore thumb

iii

  the day after hector mcgraths
desperate game of high finance with
messrs hamburger and einstein he
discovered on the sporting page of a
new york newspaper certain tidings
which caused him to blink in a dazed
kind of fashion rub his head and ejacu-
late nowf what do you think of that 
wouldnt it jar your underpinnings
the head-line of the surprising intel-
ligence smote his mental processes in
this wise

princeton makes a

           football find

arthur trent a phenomenal half-
back picked to play for
old nassau

  hector read with wondering interest
the following despatch

                    princeton nov th

   a sensational piece of news leaked from the
secret football practise to-day hurlbert
right half-back has been shifted to the scrub
and his place taken by a strapping young

countryman from south jersey arthur trent
wh will play in the yale gftine he is work-
ing his nay through college and refused to
try for the team early iu the season mu the
ground that lie could not afford the time

i he captain and coaches finally brought suf-
ficient pressure to bear and popular opinion 
i wrly forced i rent into footlall-tog lie is
a man of wonderfully hue physique very fast
on his feet and tremendously strong  
thouih without previous knowledge of fool- i
ball he has shown such astonishing aptitude
for the game that he is considered the pi
nomenon of the princeton season

hector flung the newspaper aside 
until now his absorption in the activi- j

lies of the campus had shoved into the 
background of his memory that episode j
of midsummer when he had enjoyed 
the hospitality and the endearing com- 
panionship of the mother of arthur 
trent when they had driven together 
from the gray crumbling farmhouse
to the county-fair ground- of oakville j
his first impulse was to rush in search 
of jim stearns and tell him that this
arthur trent had made a technical j
professional of himself by competing 
for cash prizes and urge that a pro- j
test be lodged against his playing with
the princeton team this was an ef- j
fective and summary way of crippling i
the enemys strength but as loyal as 
he was to yale as fond as he was of i
jim stearns and as much he had j
personally at stake hector hesitated 
and the longer he delayed the more his i
indecision grew he vividly recalled 
the mothers pride in hersplendid son i
her devotion and her sacrifices and her 
intimate part in the struggle to send 
him to college it was true that he 
had won a paltry sum in athletic com- j
petition but did he know that he was j
placing a bar sinister athwart his ca- j
reer at princeton hector became i
more and more perplexed as to what he
ought to do had arthur trent con-
fessed his offense to the princeton
coaches and were they overlooking it
as worthy of extenuation and any-
how were the rules devised to safe- 
guard the purity and sportsmanlike j
spirit of college athletics ever intended
to punish such a case as this

one fact was clear hector mc-
grath had it in his power to deprive
a case of professionalism



i yales dearest foe of her phenomenal
r half-back he had only to instigate a
protest and offer himself as an eye-
i- witness of the violation of the code

i	to carry conviction what held him

	back from this step was a mosf worthy
i and wholly unselfish emotion he could

ii	not bring himself to see that young
j trent had done anything deserving
 punishment to drag him into an ugly
 scandal to let his name be bandied

i about in the newspapers as a profes-
sional unmasked by yale in the nick
b of time why all this would be unjus-
tified by the facts and wickedly cruel
i both to the boy and to his mother
trent was intrinsically the kind of
man any college should be proud to
 enroll among its students after
wrestling with these reflections for a
long time hector said to himself

i dont want to see jim stearns
 whipped and i hate like poison to lose
twelve hundred dollars but even if
it means a victory for princeton to let
this arthur trent stay on the team ill

-	swear i dont see how i can feel square
i and decent if i get him fired in dis-
grace and that is all there is to it he
 hasnt been slaving like a nigger all
 these years to go to college to be an

	athlete and his mother isnt living by
  herself in that tumble-down cottage to

a make a football hero out of him they
 are the real things i dont care what
 the college lawmakers say they didnt
 want to bar that kind of a man when
 they made their rules and if arthur
 trent wants to take that view of it and
 keep his mouth shut it is none of my
business

   this view of the problem sufficed
fl no more than overnight after the first
recitation hour next day jim stearns
 slapped hector on the back and re-
 marked

	you had better apply for that meal-
 ticket early to avoid the rush we are
ej up against it harder in the princeton

	game than t thought did you hear
l they have taken hurlbert out and put

a in an unknown named trent at right-
i half  hurlbert was as good as any
n man we have behind the line and this
i freshman must be a wonder or they

wouldnt put him in as near the end oi
the season as this i hoped you saved
a good pair of walking-shoes out of
the wreck of your wardrobe hector
you may have to hoof it home from
mr princetons town

  hector flushed stammered and
looked aside in the face of this
speech it seemed the rankest treason
to hold his tongue but the vision of
mrs harriet trent framed in her old-
fashioned garden persisted in obtru-
ding itself her son could knowingly
do nothing dishonorable and even now
hector could not square it with his
sense of right and justice to turn in-
former he managed to laugh at the
captains warning and replied with an
effort to appear at ease

  you will have that infant phenom-
enon tied up in a hard knot in the first
five minutes of play jim wait until
they send him at your side of the fir-
ing-line it is a foolish move for
princeton to make at this eleventh
hour

  on the following sunday no fewer
than three new york newspapers pub-
lished photographs of arthur trent as
the sensation of the eastern football
season the accompanying paragraphs
praised him for modesty and manli-
ness and told how he had been wailing
on the table at an eating-club and help-
ing the local expressman in order to
earn his college expenses but the
argument which swayed hector mc-
graths sympathies most strongly was
the fact that even in these badly repro-
duced photographs arthur trent had
his mothers eyes kindly trustful
smiling at the world as if they knew
no guile

  i guess i will have to stand by the
old homestead was hectors final
verdict it may cost me twelve hun-
dred good dollars but the price isnt
big enough to make me play judas to
the trent family

  the great yale-princeton game of
that year was played without the en-
thusiastic presence of that ardent
heeler hector alonzo mcgrath his
reasons for staying behind in new


the popular magazine

haven while the college almost to a
man joyously departed to view the con-
flict were not wholly of a financial na-
ture to an impatient classmate who
implored him to forego his mad reso-
lution to maroon himself on the cam-
pus he explained with some heat

  my nerves wont stand it  come
within an ace of blowing up whenever
 see a big game and this year  have
too much at stake to risk it no im
going down to heubleiivs and lake the
bulletins as they come off the wire
there will be time enough between
them for me to stow away a bracing
drink and  can be quiet and within
easy call of an ambulance if princeton
happens to score from the kick-off
good-by bill just tell them that you
saw me

  at the hour when the vast holiday
multitude was filling the slopes of the
amphitheater of another city hector
alonzo mcgrath might have been seen
to wander pensively across the new
haven green and seek a shadowy cor-
ner of a deserted cafe a stout griz-
zled german waiter who had been
called bismark by his student
patrons for a dozen years waddled to
the table and asked with genuine so-
licitude 

  is you sick or sometings mr mc-
grath how it vas dot you stays
away from the game 

  i am not strong enough to tell you
bismark wearily quoth the solitary
guest i want you to bring the bulle-
tins over to ray corner as fast as they
come in and read them to me in a
low soothing voice dont let yourself
get excited no matter what news you
get or youre likely to sec me jump on
the table and bark i am on the edge
of a collapse from excessive brain-fag
and with every bulletin bring a mug of
musty ale

  bismark bowed made no comment
and ambled off to ask the cashier about
the telegraph service fearing that any
delay in serving the bulletins piping hot
might bring on one of the mysterious
attacks so darkly hinted at hectors
nerves were indeed unstrung now
that it was too late toalter his decision

he was a prey lo wretched misgivings
lest after all he had chosen the wrong

course he was enough of a man
to think of his duty to yale rather
than of his imperiled twelve hundred
dollars yet the latter motive was by
no means forgotten and he miserably
reflected

  it is a toss-up whether i am a
mart r to my convections or just sev-
enteen kinds of a blankety-blank fool
and some wise man put it down in a
book that hed rather be a rascal than
a fool hither bismark you neednt
wait for a bulletin to fetch me that
first mug of musty ale

  the waiter trotted in with a slip of
paper in his fist and the mug of ale
on a tray anxiously inquiring

vat vill you have first mr mc-
grath here is the trink und here is
the openin message from the game
read it bismark for heavens
sake read it quick

  all right mr mcgrath it says
like this

  yale kicks off und trent rushes hall hack
to midfield from princeton twenty-yard line
princeton loses hall on fumble stearns
makes ten yards for yale through left tackle
on first down time called yale man hurt

dot is all mr mcgrath

  just like one of these college-ath-
letic stories with gibson pictures isnt
it was hectors comment the
brilliant freshman who makes the team
at the last minute sails in and wing the
game i dont like the way this trent
person starts off fact and fiction seem
to be agreeing too blamed well

  but through several successive bul-
letins as sonorously proclaimed by bis-
mark the name of trent no longer
came to harrow the feelings of the
gloomy listener yale was having the
better of it and the first half ended
with the blue leading by one touch-
down to nothing

  maybe he isnt going to be a story-
book hero after all sighed hector
say bismark would you rather be
right than be president

  i haf sometimes thinked i vas right
till  asked my wife but i haf never
been president very seriously an-
a case of professionalism



swcred the waiter vat is it  your
mind so troublesome mr mcgrath
eh-

  well i think i will put my prob-
lem up to you bismark do you think
it pays lo hew to the line let the chips
fall where they may in other words
you have lived a good many years and
jn your time you have had a birds-eye
view of several thousand young men at
their meat and drink is virtue its
own reward and is a conscience a nui-
sance of an organ like your appendix
or not

  if you mean vat i tink you tink
you mean mr mcgrath i vill tell you
dot ven a man can look himself square
in his own eye he vill be liapp dere
is no room for arguments i know und
i have seen now vill i feed you an-
udder bulletin und a 

  let them come bismark i feel
stronger you have spoken a  wise
word in due season ah the cashier
is waving a bunch of tidings at s
hop over and fetch it

  it were painful to protract the agony
of the second half in which princeton
scored a touch-down then another and
held this margin of victory until the
last moments of the game then the
doleful waiter read in a voice weighted
with woe

  steams breaks through und has a clear
field for princetons goal thirtv vard a wav
he is run down and tack led by trent tnr -
yards from princetons goal-line tiire
called game ends princeton  vale

     the way compliments are returned

 some one was having a party at a small village there was a town girl who
 was visiting in the community attending the party

          all the boys wanted a hurry-up introduction and one in particular was
  very anxious but the others managed to keep him out until she promised the
 other boys that she would let this particular gentleman down hard

       accordingly he wras introduced and the conversation ran pleasantly slowly

 	and skilfully she drew him out and he tendered her his choicest compliments

 	especially on looks

       the other boys had nudged tip close as possible to hear him drop
 j thank you so much she replied but im really sorry i cant say the same
 about you then she leaned back with the air of a conqueror while die lioys
  nudged each other and winked

 i wy began the young man blushing but little i guess you could by
 doing as i did-tell a lie about it

tiif skirts of li a pc iiance

f it be but mouthing a
truism to say by way
of preface to my story
that fortune sometimes
wears strange faces i
can but plead in ex-
tenuation my own re-
cent experience a re-
view of which brings the platitude so
insistently to mind that i am impressed
 should get no further did i fail to
relieve my conscience of the observa-
tion

  fortune i repeat wears strange
faces it must not be held against me
a evidence of lack of intelligence that
i failed to recognize her in the guise
of secrctan

  to get the flavor of the matter you
nuit have in mind a picture of myself
with all the grim attendant circum-
stance of my then state of life

  you must figure to yourself first of
all a rain-swept corner on kearney
street toward the end of a wretched
rowdy day gutters running ellow tor-
rents cobbles scoured clean and
shining belated cabs and cable-cars
racketing past with dreary tear-
blurred windows lender and crystal-
line lances of rain gleaming like silver
in the gloom as the wind flung them
slantingly athwart the aureoles of splut-
tering arcs  sidewalks swept and gar-

nished all san francisco that owned a
home snugly entrenched within doors
ami myself loitering disconsolate be-
neath the wooden awning of a corner
grocery an object- could clearly rec-
ognize though i affected to ignore it-
of interest to a blue-coated policeman
across the way himself too cozy in the
side door of a saloon not to be reluc-
tant to venture forth and shoo sus-
picious-lookiug characters off the high-
way

  for i am sensible that i cut a sus-
picious figure as i loitered there the
collar of my too small coat turned up to
mask the absence of linen my trou-
sers-so disreputable as to justify the
prim evasiveness that once character-
ized the articles as unmentionables--
six inches short of my ankles sodden
shoes gaping a pulpy derby jammed
down over my eyes nothing in my
pockets-not even bottoms-but my
hands

  iiow long i had lingered in that spot
-ten twenty or thirty minutes-i can-
not say  did nof in fact much care
having fallen into a heavy listless mood
that colored my outlook upon life un-
pleasantly i remember favoring the
staring policeman with a lowering
scowl that was in itself an invitation
to step across and run me in i would
not have resisted my whole being
was absorbed in desire for cooked
meat drinks and warm clothing and
there was no place in all that city
shadow reef



famed for its hospitality whither i
 might turn in search of any one of
these-save the police-station

   presently i became aware that i was
become the object of anothers regard
aside from that of the arm of the law 
the proprietor of the corner grocery a
rotund teutonic figure in soiled white
apron had stepped to his door i con-
ceived that he credited me with dark
designs upon the few empty barrels and
boxes which cluttered the sidewalk be-
fore his windows and smiled i sup-
pose grimly at the thought a smile
which he evidently chose to take as
personal

r fy don you choost mofe on he
demanded with some unnecessary heat
 what for i countered pleasantly
im not doing you any harm am i

  you choost mofe on he repeated
with rising choler unt uf you dond

   choost call der boliceman 

i call him and be damned i re-
turned listlessly

i py golly sputtered the german
ill show you hi mister police-
mans he bawled

  out of the corner of my eye t -aw
the guardian of the peace shake him-
self and advance unwillingly from his
shelter a gust of wind and rain as-
sailed him on the instant and he came
pelting across head down truncheon
brandished coat-tails flying

i and upon that-mark the incon-
sistency of human nature-i who a
moment agone had contemplated with-
out disfavor the prospect of -spending
the night in a dry warm cell instantly
began to hedge and formulate excuses
never before low as the tide of my
fortunes had run for months past had
i come into the custody of the law  and
i suppose that no man submits to ar-
rest the first time without repugnance
r here now blustered the police-
man you move on an no shentiani-
gan

  w hat for i flashed defiantly the
 streets are free i believe

  none v that now move on i say
what business you got hangin around
here-

 dots w at i want to know inter-
jected the groceryman

   presume i replied that a man
is at liberty to wait here and keep an
appointment with a friend if he
wishes

  aw cut it out move on

  i saw the hand of authority stretched
forth to grasp my collar and recoiled
instinctively tt was at this juncture
that masquerading fortune caught me
by the arm anti whirled me into an ad-
venture as mad  conceive as ever
man knew

  a hand indeed was laid forcible
upon my person but it was not the
policemans nor did it touch my collar
in brief it was inserted into my am
and i found myself carried along a
pace or two before i became actually
aware of the intervention of a fourth
person to which enlightenment a
voice ringing in my ear contributed
materially

  come along my dear fellow it
insisted with a hearty and sincere in-
tonation good lord what a day
will you ever forgive me for having-
kept you waiting so long 

   hung back vainly endeavoring to
free my arm and so was swung about
face to face with and got a good im-
pression of the newcomer of whose
approach to that moment i had been
entirely unconscious

  he proved an odd and pleasing little
person  stoutish with a round lively
face full-colored as a boys and un-
shaven  eyes gray and remarkable for a
peculiar effect of size out of all pro-
portion to the rest of his features
caused by the thick and saucgrlike
glasses he wore for the rest he was
uncommonly well dressed and groomed
to be abroad afoot in such weather
his raincoat worn carelessly unbut-
toned flapped back in the breeze dis-
closing a dark and well-cut morning
coat a sober black-and-white plaid
waistcoat and gray-striped trousers
turned up above patent-leather shoes
altogether the effect was something
professional you would have guessed
him first of all a physician next pos-
sibly a lawyer with a steady and com-


the vovulatr magazine

fortable practise lastly an unfrocked
priest anti you would have been
wrong in each instance

  come come he iterated cheerful-
ly theres nothing here to hold you
surely and my cursed unpunctaality
bids fair to make us late for dinner

  in a moment i had yielded to the
persuading pressure of the arm within
mine and entered into the insane spirit
of the misadventure-the case of mis-
taken identity that i believed it to be
this i was the more willing to do since
it afforded me the opportunity to es-
cape and to confound my late perse-
cutors

  with a malicious farewell glance
over my shoulder which surprised both
pleasingly open-eyed and agape  fell
into step with my importunate if new-
found acquaintance and swaggered
along under his umbrella down-at-heel
and out-at-elbow as  was like i dare
say a hungry wolf accepting the
wayside companionship of a bleating
lamb

  and a veritable lamb this impetuous
person appeared to be continually he
assailed my ears with an uninterrupted
blatting his voice was clear and a
trifle high his enunciation rapid and
so markedly precise as to seem affected 
and he prattled on like a machine gone
mad guilelessly artlessly about every-
thing and nothing of consequence

  within ten yards he was smitten by
an inspiration this when he had-un-
consciously  fancied-revealed his
name it was some exclamation about
the foulness of the weather as sure
as my name is dudley secretan he
aflirrjjed with a great show of earnest-
nt- and the next moment

  bless my soul how thoughtless i
am of course we must have a cab
he flung his round little person im-
petuously in front of me and waved
both hands and the umbrella frantically
at a passing hansom

  i remarked the cabby on his box
eying our incongruous company with
an open smile as he wheeled in at the
curb and looking back beheld the jo-
liceman browbeating the german in re-
turn for his labor lost and  think it

was this latter sight that decided me o
continue to humor the little mans self-
imposed deception-at least until we
were around a corner

  meanwhile he was overwhelming me
with apologic- for what he insisted was
his unpardonable lack of punctuality
and meanwhile assigned me a name-
liemstreet

  my dear liemstreet he chirped
you have no idea liow sorry  am
but indeed  could not help it a mat-
ter of business intervened and unfor-
tunately my youthful training was la-
mentably deficient in that it never suc-
ceeded in instilling into me the precepts
of punctuality i have that quarrel with
my early education of late as you
know my ways of life have not been
such as would conduce to awaken me
to times value to men of affairs like
yourself

  and lie went on without a break
from the curb to cab and for as long
as we inhabited that vehicle once only
did he turn his attention from me and
then it was on what i may call the for-
ward deck of the hansom straining on
tiptoe to see the cabbys face over ihe
roof and give him the address i do
not recall the latter clearly after this
lapse of time but i remember being im-
pressed that it was in a respectable
neighlxrhood if not nob hill itself

  vainly i attempted to interrupt with
explanation and apology to awaken him
to his misunderstanding and stem the
tide of his babbling eloquence he
would have none of it his voice
jlowed on forever indomitable over-
whelming my feeble utterances regard-
less of my imploring accents rising
clear and penetrating above the swish
and clamor of the rain and the rattle of
our cabs progress through the streets

  so that at length i surrendered at
discretion and sat back resigned if
wondering where in that small if fleshy
person was the storehouse of the fund
of inexhaustible energy that animated
mr dudley secretan he filled in my
silence without embarrassment his
monologue covering a vast range of
subjects some of which were astonish-
ingly personal
shadow reef



  he was good enough to reveal him-
self a bachelor without kith or kin a
man of leisure and some means i
gathered that he had artistic aspirations
nd had pursued his studies abroad
further that a lawsuit had gone poor-
lv that he heartily despised the city of
his residence that he had been disap-
pointed in love

  about myself-or whoever he be-
lieved me to be-matters were more
nebulous naturally however i was
christened henry-a name which i
have always despised assured that my
welcome would be hearty that secre-
tan trusted that i would find leisure to
pay him a prolonged visit that he had
received a letter from my sister in in-
dianapolis but by circumstances been
prevented from answering it

i and so on in my exhausted and en-
feebled state-i had paced the streets
tor want of a bedroom the previous
night and had not eaten for twenty-
four hours-i soon wearied and clo-
sing my eyes and resting my head back
fggamst the cushions let him babble
m y ears became heedless and i have no
great recollection of what he said dur-
ing the last ten minutes of the drive
although t doubt not that in other cir-
cumstances i had found it all entertain-
ing euough

 but at the moment i was content to
drowse and ponder a way to break the
thread of misapprehension and escape
without incurring the outraged wrath of
this genial mr secretan little as i
knew him i was already by way of li-
king him immensely and was conscious
of a pang of regret that circumstances
conspired so soon to separate me from
his engaging personality

i for his part he seemed to foresee
nothing of the sort tongue clacking
chcerilv he was at peace with himself
and the world the glances that from
time to time i stole at him through
half-lowered lashes showed his coun-
tenance rosily aglow with enjoyment
and enthusiasm

i presently-i awoke to the fact with
a regret-the cab drew up in front of
a house with brownstone facade in the
middle of a long row of counterparts

as i had anticipated the street proved
severely respectable and wore an air of
conscious position of comfort an i
worldly rectitude that assorted well
with the manner of this one of its in-
habitants

  the latter no sooner than the cab
apron was thrown back hopped nimbly
out and had his umbrella up and a
settlement effected with the driver be-
fore i could get to ground then as
before overcame my reluctance with
an insistent firm hand upon my arm
piloting me up the brownstone steps

  i yielded i hardly know why or how
and went with him the open door
above held wide by a stately butler
diffused a glow of comfortable light
upon the rain-streaked darkness with-
out together with a promise of warmth
and comfort-such warmth and com-
fort amid a gentlemans surroundings
as once i had tasted and now longed
again to taste in every fiber of my fam-
ished weary being

  and that prospect tempting me re-
gardless of the probability of imminent
discovery the minute the light fell
upon my rags and tatters with the at-
tendant humiliation of contumely and
eviction i yielded and preceded secre-
tan into his hallway i think i can see
yet the glare of amazed resentment in
the butlers eyes as they lit upon me
and i can still feel the inward shrink-
ing from exposure that instantly as-
sailed me but-a circumstance i had
no chance to forget-the lord and mas-
ter of the establishment was at my
heels carrying the situation off with
a high hand and an outstretched
arm

  ah benson-this to the butler-
we are late you see no matter i
dare say that dinner will not suffer ror
fifteen minutes- postponement have
mr hemstreets trunks arrived ben-
son notoo bad too bad mr
hemstreet was caught in the storm
benson and thoroughly drenched as
you see we must try to fit him out
for the night at least i dare say we
can make a passable shift to find him

jones lo him w ith a complete change

	f clohing tell jones i shall not need

ilim this evening i can dress myself
for once

  my dear henry turning to me i
trust you will lack for nothing  am
only sorry chat our abominable express
service deprives you of your wardrobe
for the night but no matter we are
alone-and  believe that junes has re-
cently purchased a new suit of evening
clothes which should fit you approxi-
mately he has never worn them so
you wont mind  have a thousand
things to do you will excuse my de-
serting you we meet in half an hour
at a dinner which i promise you can-
not be excelled in san francisco

  in a maze but conscious that there
was something more than curious about
this adventure  followed the butler up
the stairs-seeing in every line oi his
rigid back his temper of disapprobation
beneath his eye i could have cringed
for i knew that the fellow had seen
through mv masquerade and it com-
forted me not at all to reflect that my
part in the affair had been at worst
merely negative

  yet-and this perplexed me not a
little-it seemed as if benson avoided
my eye at a door on the upper floor
he stood aside deferential as you
please and when i had passed through
shut the door between us

   i found myself in a luxuriously fur-
nished sleeping-apartment upon whose
hearth a fire of anthracite was blazing
comfortably behind twinkling brass
fender and fire-dogs still shivering in
my sodden clothes i made haste to step
across and back up to this grateful
warmth

  from here my gaze ranged the four
walls of the room and penetrated to a
farther closet through whose half-open
door  caught a glimpse of a porcelain
bathtub and gleaming nickel fittings a
four-poster canopied snowy counter-
pane half hidden by a quilt of eider-
down encased in silk stood against the
side wall between the windows a
shaving-table stood arranged with im-
plements complete the bureau-top
was strewn with bright silver combs

and brushes easy and inviting chairs
were disposed handily a gentle and

diffused glow of electric light made the
room radiant

the sense of comfort it all distilled
was inexpressible  contemplated it

with a swelling heart all this-and
more-had been mine once upon a time

  the arrival of the valet jones dis-
turbed a somber and covetous reverie
plunging me once again into a violent
discomfiture but by no word or look
did the man-a perfectly trained serv-
ant or i never knew one-betray his
understanding of my position in that
house apparently it was the most or-
dinary of occurrences for a palpable im-
postor to walk in at the front door and
make himself at home

  jones bore with him a steaming glass
upon a silver tray which he offered
me with mr secretans compli-
ments sir he said eyelids lowered
he said as how it would do vou good
after your wetting sir

  the craving was strong upon me
against my better judgment i yielded
accepted and drained the dose of hot
brandy and water it did me no good
upon my empty stomach to the con- i
trary it radiated through my system like
molten flame robbing me of every
vestige of self-respect and compunction
up to that moment i protest it had
been my purpose presently to declare
myself i had been interested in and
much engaged by the adventure and
more than a little allured by the
thought of food and warmth but i
had determined not to let it proceed 
further confessions were already -
formulating in my mind-as such
things will in the minds of those who i
live by their pen

  but now- submitted graciously to j
the attentions of jones permitted my-w
self to be undressed conveyed to aij
warm bath wherein i wallowed joy-jfl
fully if in a daze stood out rubberm
down and in a cozy dressing-gown was
shaved stepped withouta murmur intquj
not only another mans shoes but int
his socks his underwear his shirt anlj
collar and evening clothes as well

  in brief i became another man whd-wj
shadow reef



iy the old life was cast into the dark
abyss of yesterdays sloughed like the
skin of a snake i saw myself vaguely
an unreal semblance of a gentleman in
a pier-glass and like the old woman in
the nursery rhyme cried-to myself-
oh this is never i then graciously
accepted a handkerchief from jones
hand tucked it of old habit into my
cult and descended the stairs-i believe
with outward self-possession

  secretan was waiting for me on the
hearth-rug of what seemed to be half
a drawing half a bachelors living-
room he too had changed to eve-
ning clothes and- discovered with a
start-had screwed a monocle into his
chubby face as i crossed to join him
heavy curtains at one end of the room
were drawn aside disclosing a table set
and splendid with glass and plate and
napery and the butler announced din-
ner

  constraint held my tongue during the
first course secretan and i faced one
another like guilty things-for while
he ate he might not talk and without
the salt of his eternal flow of language
the situation went ilat and tasteless
but with the coming of the roast and
an accompanying- draft of generous
burgundy i lost discretion altogether
i gabbled i know not what i said
possibly it would be easier to catalogue
the topics upon which i failed to des-
cant

  i remember that there was a mirror
on the opposite wall behind secretans
chair and inclined at such an angle that
it reflected my hosts back the table and
myself into this from time to time i
must have glanced for of all that
evening-the dinner from the moment
my lips were unsealed by the wine is a
blank to me-i recall nothing but the
presentment of a man at meat his face
flaming red above an expanse of snowy
shirt-front his eyes wild-a man who
laughed and chattered and flourished
knife and fork and wolfed his food
shame overwhelms me at the recollec-
tion  for that man was myself drunk i
have heard as a lord

  if that is so the nobility are a disso-
lute and disreputable set

chapter ii

the morning -after

  a douche of cold water over my
head brought me suddenly to my
senses i presume i must have been
sleeping with my mouth open-a bad
habit in proof of which  got a mouth-
ful of brackish liquid which came near
to strangling me coughing and spitting
i staggered to ray feet and the world
reeling under me would have fallen
had not a hand rough but not unkind-
ly caught my shoulder and steadied
me whereupon  opened eyes on a
new world

  i stood with difficulty upon the after-
deck near the wheel of a topsail
schooner of some hundred and fifty
tons so much i learned later but its
place is here at the moment of my
awakening to realization of this fact
the vessel was poised upon the foaming
crest of a gigantic comber an instant
later she reeled in sickening fashion and
slid a mile or more-or so it seemed-
down toward the bottom of the sea
yet before it was loo late apparently
plucked heart of desperation steadied
herself with an assertive lurch and be-
gan to negotiate the seemingly endless
ascent of another wave whose snowy
ridge towered above us in imminent
and to me frightful menace

  but nothing came of it the schooner
gained the summit without mishap
poised again in irresolute fashion and
again shot down the incline leaving
behind a smoking wake

  my fears abated by the gallant be-
havior of the little craft i turned to
get a more intimate knowledge of my
surroundings for as yet my brain
swam and  had little actual comprehen-
sion of my position

  overhead hung a sky of pellucid
blue marked with long windy stream-
ers of cloud as white as the canvas of
the schooner out of which a flood of
sunlight fell like a shower of gold the
air was keen and bracing full of the
savor of salr and a brisk wind twanged
the rigging with ungentle fingers
eliciting clear and mournful aeolian
notes


the ppular magazine

  beside me on the deck stood a grin-
ning gentlemanof color with an empty

dripping bucket in his hand at first i
took him for a negro beyond him his
apparent twin stood at the wheel sway-
ing gracefully as lie shined vlie spokes
before me a white man of medium
height stood with feet wide braced
against the motion of the vessel blue
eyes twinkling- out of a good-humored
bronzed countenance hands thrust care-
lessly into the pockets of a pea-jacket

  forward two more figures lounged
in the lee of the cooks galley smo-
king

  the man in the pea-jacket spoke
yell be feci in betther  he inquired
in a brogue of depth and richness

  the salt water that had roused me
so effectually was dripping into my
eyes  dashed the hack of my hand
acres- them and faced him with a quiv-
ering assumption of defiance

  where the devil am i   demanded
-probably not o coherently as  write
it what ships this and how do i
come aboard her 

  the ltddy az qualityreturned
the irishman curtly enough t thought
and with a narrowing of the blue eyes
twelve hours out av frisco-and it
yell be wantin further information
yed betther step below and put thim
to the skipper-onless yere minded to
modherate yer tone whin spakin to
me

  ive been shanghaied i cried and
damned him

  mebbe so tis no affair av mine
ill have ye know im mate of this
vessel and ill thank ye to kape yer
curses to yer self

  i was rapidly regaining mv poise by
now and saw that  had made a mis-
take in rousing the mans temper in-
explicable as i found my position it
bore scant resemblance to the tales of
shanghaied men that t had read
neither had i been assaulted my teeth
knocked down my throat and my ribs
broken nor was there any apparent
disposition to pick a fight with me on
the question of sirring the ships of-
ficers i gulped and reconsidered

  if youre the mate what am i i
demanded less clearly than i intended

  the irishman who had turned life
shoulder swung about and looked me
up and down im hanged he said
at length if i know what ye are uit
what ye are not is plain enough and
thats a gintilman if yeve any more
damns t dbthribute kape thim for
the skipper ive aid yell find him in
the cabin

  he jerked a thumb toward the com-
panionway and showed me the breadth
of his back stupefied  accepted dis-
missal with the hint and staggered un-
steadily to the ladder a moment l iter
 stood below staring at the face of
mr dudley secrelan and trying to
piece together the disjointed memories
evoked by the sight of it

  as for that gentleman he was seated
at the table poring over a chart an
open book at his elbow a fountain pen
poised in his fingers upon my en-
trance he looked up smiled genially re-
moved the monocle and swung alout
in his chair im glad to see you look-
ing so well he greeted me precisely in
his mincing manner he added mr
locke

  locke i echoed in dismay iiow
did you know--

  pray be sealed mr locke se-
cretan motioned me to a chair into
which i sank helpless and distraught
for a moment my erstwhile host-i
was already beginning to remember-
smiled upon me-or rather beamed

  then you have no notion i assure
you said he how many things you
can tell about yourself in a given space
of time my dear fellow i confess i
have rarely listened to so interesting a
tale-outside of book-covers-as that
which you unfolded at my table yes-
ternight interesting critically and
moving i was quite carried out of my-
self upon my word hut let me re-
assure you that your confidence will be
rigidly respected so far as your past
history is concerned i have however
taken the liberty of giving your true
name to the crew  where we are bo md
it will never be connected with the un-
fortunate but not-permit me-dis-
shavow reef

  creditable circumstances you have re-
  counted

    he ceased with a little bow - and
  courteously waited for my response i
  fear it was long in coming a glow of
  sympathetic interest and mild satisfac-
  tion suffused his childlike countenance
  i sat with drooping jaw staring hush-
  ing with shame when i remembered
  the circumstances under which i had
  made this man my confidant who
  twenty-four hours before had been a
  stranger to me

    ar length im afraid  do not un-
  derstand said i slowly you meet
  me in the street a homeless wanderer
  you pretend to recognize in me a friend
  and take me to your home you dose
  me with brandy and wine-a potent
  mixture to a stomach for long accus-
  tomed to little beyond water and bread 
  you stupefy me with drink and carry
  me out to sea aboard a vessel upon a
  voyage i do not understand this 

 repeated helplessly be good enough
  to explain or else turn back and leave
  me where you found me

    i should be reluctant to lose you 
  but if you insist after hearing my ex-
  planation i shall do so there is no
  disposition to detain you aboard the
  lady of quality without your consent
  then in gods name i cried tell
  me what this means

    pardon me i but sought the proper
  form of words you have my name i

i have never worn another-i mean no
  offense my dear sir i believe myself

	to be a strangely unpractical creature
  full of whims and crankisms

     can believe that i interpolated
    you have already had a taste of my

	quality he assented unruffled what-

 ever fortune was once mine has been

	dissipated this way and that-i admit
  that  hardly know whither it has flown

	nor how i managed to speed its flight
  the fact remains-as i discovered not

i a mouth ago that it is gone-vanished

	altogether t ask you to conceive of
  my sensations when i found myself a

r man of middle age and settled indo-
  lence with an unpardonable distaste for
  manual labor in any form what was
  i to do



  in spite of his affected viys of
speech his quaint mannerisms diis
strange little body was affecting me
with a curious magnetism indignant
and at a loss as i was  found xnvself
lending his stilted phrases a sympa-
thetic ear assured of this by my atti-
tude for secrftan was shrewd enough
when he chose to exercise that quality
-he proceeded gradually warming to
his account

      as i to turn clerk and slave over
ledgers that i did not understand
could i go into the streets and earn a
livelihood wielding a pick and spade
should i husband the scant remnant of
my resources and attempt to eke out a
living by the sale of my pictures-
which had long ago demonstrated to
my entire satisfaction that they com-
manded no earthly market i put the
situation to you as a man of experience
then opportunity came my way-the
present opportunity

  lie waved a comprehensive hand at
the bare painted walls of the cabin i
happened one day to pick up a paper
my eye fell upon the column devoted to
nautical news and advertisements i
saw a schooner advertised for sale at a
moderate figure the means at my
command were ample to purchase the
schooner refit her and leave me a
margin at my bankers which insignifi-
cant as it may have seemed in other
days proves comfortable enough to a
small ship-owner

  i made inquiries i met the former
captain and owner of this vessel he
was retiring to a life of market-garden-
ing with a competence amassed by
trade among the islands of the s- nth
seas we struck a bargain   became
owner of the lady of quality and mas-
ter not only of her fortunes but of my
own there is a living to be picked up
by island trading i ask no more than
that atid an opportunity to indulge my
foibles--to read my favorite books and
execute the horrible daubs which you
will be asked to pass upon-if you con-
clude to stay with me

  he was in deadly earnest i could
have laughed in his face for the lov-
able solemnity of his expression but


the popular magazine

rcfraiid from interruption he prat-
tler on unfolding his childish scheme
with the gravity of a judge delivering
judgment yet with a  elusive and ap-
pealing touch now and again as
though he yearned or approbation

  i sold my house and it furniture
severed every tic which bound me to my
birthplace-they were few enough-
and prepared to embark at the last
moment i discovered an appalling de-
fect in my plans tie paused

  and that was  encouraged him

  mr locke i have been all my days
a lonely man yet racked by hunger for
human companionship upon this ven-
ture i wa- sure to find it of a sort one
cannot hold aloof from it if one would
when hemmed in by the walls of a ship
but the sort was not to my liking
mr brannan the mate is a sterling
character  am convinced yet hardly
of the order of intelligence that appeals
to me  determined that i must have
one of my own sort as a companion
the problem confronted me of now to
get him

  i dare say you will ridicule the
means i finally adopted you already
know them i was acquainted with no
one likely to fall in with my proposi-
tion  i had to seek such a person in the
ranks of-of-

  of the failures

  thartk you-though he deprecated
the term rings a trifle harsh how-
ever i sought diligently for a while in
the lower ranks but without success
those who offered themselves were
self-seeking or of criminal instinct
or embittered and unsociable-i found
a hundred faults with each then in a
moment of despair i chanced upon
you a man plainly of birth and breed-
ing at odds with fortune through it
might prove no fault of your own

  the rest you know in the main
my arrangements were all made my
servants accustomed to what you and
they doubtless consider mv freaks of
madness for it had been my habit to
subject each candidate to a test similar
to yours if he behaved himself at
table if he wore his clothes lil a man
who had worn them before showed

himself acquainted with the niceties of
ordinary social intercourse-it was so
many points in his favor

  so deliberately i abducted von as
deliberately planned to intoxicate you

i am a firm believer in the wisdom of
the old saw tliat there is truth in the
wine-cup a mans true nature then
comes to the surface you alone of
many survived the critical ordeal

   am complimented i said with a
forced laugh

  while you slept secretan con-
tinued without heeding t had you
transferred to the lady of quality by
one this morning we had weighed
anchor-i believe that is the term it
was my purpose to explain this to you
earlier in the day and make you my
offer if you declined to return and t t
you ashore but you proved so sound
a sleeper my dear fellow that it seemed
at length advisable to waken you b the
heroic methods advised by mr bran-
nan

  one moment and i am done with
your patience  offer you a com-
fortable living aboard a stanch craft
an opportunity to travel in what  am
assured is held an earthly paradise
regular wages as supercargo whose
duties you will assume and a one-
fourth share of the profits of each voy-
age what do you say

  there was no need to think it over 
no single tie bound me to my country
i do not propose to weary you with de-
tails but the land was not dear to me
i looked into the rubicund moonlike
countenance of this singular creature
caught the plaintively anxious expres-
sion of his magnified eye- and impul-
sively offered him my hand

  i could have no other answer than
yes under the circumstances i told
him you offer me everything it ex-
change for nothing  should warn
you that you are talcing chances you
have raked a bundle ot human flotsam
out of a teeming gutter of life and
you have no certificate that it will prove
wholesome	

  i am content to run the risk he re-
plied beaming as he gripped my fin-
gers across the table i may as well

warn you at the outset that it is one
of my pet hallucinations to fancy my-
self as a judge of character and i
am rarely wrong

  in such wise fortune came to me
disguised as dudley secretan

chapter iii

we come to shadow reef

  to this point in my narrative i have
confined myself to the detailing some-
what minutely and i fear tediously
the strange chain of circumstances
which led to my association with this
peculiar character dudley secretan i
find myself now confronted with a
problem of greater proportions one al-
ways perplexing to a man of letters-
that of exact elimination

  for it is one of the secrets of success
in my trade-i have  hesitation in
betraying it to a breathless world of
inky amateurs it is perhaps the one
morsel of useful knowledge that i pur-
chased at the bitter price of experience
in my long and unhappy term of bond-
age as slave of the midnight lamp-
the knowledge of what not to tell in
your study of life

  the voyage of the lady of quality
to me is a book of romance whose il-
luminated pages are the glowing days
and scented nights whose text is made
up of an intricate and interentangled
series of incidents insignificant in them-
selves but infinitely entrancing to one
who lived and had his being in their
procession a volume wherein i un-
tiring read-a thousand-and-one things
with which i may not weary you

  that out of their agglomeration
grew the story of shadow reef is be-
side the point i often muse over this
and that memory of our outward voy-
age and wonder would i have this tale
to tell had i not say  a particular
morning happened to cut myself while
shaving and so delayed the shore-
bound boat at honolulu and in such
wise started an endless chain of trivial
events

  but we are impatient for the story
both eager to set foot on shadow reef


the leisurely pen of reminiscence must
be laid aside in favor of a more lively
implement

  yet certain men and things must not
be slighted since they belong to the
work on the reef the lady of qual-
ity demands for herself a place a
stanch and able craft roomy enough
for our small company comfortable
cleanly swift and able-i have it on
brannans enthusiastic authority-to
sail a point closer to the wind-what-
ever that may mean-than a mission-
ary

  brannan himself is worthy of a por-
trait of more just values than i have
hereinbefore painted of him a sea-
man to his finger-tips steady conserva-
tive daring in emergency a prey to
periodical fits of deep melancholy which
nothing might avail to moderate gen-
erous swift to pass judgment upon his
fellow man-generally a judgment
which circumstances forced him to re-
verse which he did with a good grace
rabidly religious-he had been bred a
stanch roman catholic-by spasms-
which usually preceded a period of de-
pression  unstable as water in the mat-
ter of his word quick to promise and
slow to fulfil a ready borrower and a
reluctant payer master alike of his
craft and of a most amazing and far-
ranging vocabulary of blasphemy and
vituperation a violent man uncom-
monly expert in the use of and free
with his fists-there you have mr
john oshaughnessy brannan upon
whom devolved the navigation of the
lady of quality

  for neither secretan nor myself
made the slightest pretension to nautical
knowledge secretan it is true picked
up the rudiments of the art with sur-
prising quickness and soon relieving
the brown kanaka seaman who had
first performed that duty stood watch
and watch with brannan and acquit-
ted himself with credit in more than
one emergency

  but for myself i remained an igno-
ramus to the end of the chapter and
so shall always be the sea is my mis-
tress  i will ever have none other the
infatuation which she first awakened in


the povular magazine

me has passed into an abiding passion
and i should starve away from her
but of the art and mysteries practised
of those who traffic upon her trackless
domains i have never gained an ink-
ling

  and then secretan- i were false

to the cardinal precepts of my calling
did  slight the presentment of this
man at sea as opposed to the seeretan
who had lifted me from the depths

  he proved on continued acquaint-
ance the most singular character imag-
inable irresistible and fascinating al-
together  toimd him both as a study
and as a friend he early developed
an adaptiveness to circumstance and his
surroundings little short of amazing
in one who had managed to reach his
age-he was about thirty-five-and yet
retain much of the ingenuousness of
youth through consistently leading a
narrow and hermitlike existence

  ashore the most immaculate of well-
dressed men lie soon learned to strike
from his limbs the shackles of a con-
ventionality which makes tailors dupes
and dummies of us all i have seen
him come on board from a brief so-
journ in one of our island ports of-call
lolling languidly in the stern of the
boat his chubby person encased in a
stiff-bosomed shirt of dazzling white-
ness carefully creased trousers of
snowy drill a double-breasted blue-
serge coat without a wrinkle white
canvas yachting-shoes upon his small
feet about whose size he was inordi-
nately conceited a priceless panama
upon his head monocle shining like a
pane of glass set in his cherubic pink
countenance

  and an hour later behold the trans-
formation 

  the schooner is beating out to wind-
ward close-hauled-the pilot long since
dropped secretan appears on deck to
relieve or take command with bran-
nan arrayed in smiles and suit of
shrunken pajamas carpet-slippers on
his feet an infamous brier in one cor-
ner of his mouth a shapeless canvas
cap upon his head it was his favorite
sea-going costume

  i find i have omitted mention of the

monocle for some inscrutable reason
he clung to this ornament with a fran-
tic devotion it is inseparable from any
picture of the man and this despite
the fact that it was utterly useless to 
him when he wished to see he had to j
exchange monocle for common-sense
spectacles  of whose uncommon magni-
fying power i have spoken

   i think his most engaging character-
istic was a bubbling humor unquench-
able the man would madden you
with fault-finding-he had a feminine
quality of nagging was old-maidish to
an insufferable degree about trifles such
as hanging your coat always on the
same peg-and then disarm your wrath
with a grin accompanied by a puerile
pun  cannot defend his humor it
was frequently moss-grown and not in-
frequently pedantic it was the spirit
of it that proved both infectious and
captivating

  he had a name for all of us i en-
joyed the sobriquet of the lilrv fel-
ler brannan was restive under the 
title of binnacle bill or of the an-
cient mariner--the case might be
the three kanakas who with the chi-
nese cook composed our crew were
variously adonis ptarmigan and t
davy jones the cook he dubbed j
pitti sing for two several reasons
which he gravely expounded  first he 
wasnt second he looked like a prize l
pug secretan had once seen at a bcnch-
sliow himself secretan called thej
dabster

   the pseudonym recalls his pitiful dejj
votion to what he called his art-the
capital a being distinctly audible in
his use of the word for days at a time
he would toil through the daylights
hours over huge pitiful canvases-
panoramas of sun and sea of islanb
and surf of moonlight and lagoon oqj
the piled drifts of the trade-wind cloud j
as they showed at noon all horribleffl
laboriously lie would construct inhu-
man portraits of brannan or myself of
one of the crew which after they hai
been suffered to make of the cabin i
chamber of horrors fr a space we
would surreptitiously make way wit-tj
and consign to the deep a primitive

 form of criticism which he endured or
 learned to endure with equanimity

  not so his own unfitness for his
 i tasks that maddened him indeed to
 me the saddest feature of it all was
 secretans complete appreciation of the
 worthlessness of his productions open-
 ly at times he would weep with rage
 over his failures if only i could paint
 it as  see it he would wail

  yet he slaved on sweating and
 swearing- at his self-inflicted drudgery
 and perhaps derived some inscrutable
 comfort from this worship and study
 of the beauties of nature which his
 brushes could not reproduce

   lastly to say a word for myself it
 developed that secretan had done not
 unwisely in assigning to me the berth
 and duties of supercargo under pres-
 sure i presently discovered latent in
 my make-up a vein of business ability
 theretofore quite unsuspected this i
 confess with becoming humility as
 something that were more consistently
 lackingfrom the equipment of a litry
 feller

   for all that i took and take to my-
 self some credit for the management
 of affairs the driving of bargains the
 mastery of those subtle laws of com-
 merce which make ventures such as
 ours profitable secretan in fact by
 degrees and not unwillingly surren-
 dered to my stewardship all such mat-
 ters

   and we did not ill the former own-
 er of the lady of quality had not de-
 ceived the prospective purchaser in as-
 serting that there was a comfortable
 living to be gained from the australa-
 sian trade all things considered we
 nnde out to our satisfaction  and at a
 vears end the balance on the credit side
 f our ledger was something which we
 i viewed with complacency

   with which statement i am done with
 idiscursiveness from this point we
 jhape a course direct to shadow reef

   destiny in the shape of a big wind
 ook us lo it i recall that we were
 wenty days or so out of sydney after
 mr first visit to that port upon bran-
 lans solicitation-the man knew the
 -islands like a printed book-and be-

   cause for some reason a profitable
 cargo was hard to get just then we
 had stocked up with what is technically
 known as trade-a miscellaneous
 assortment of this-and-that trinkets
 and cloths and oddments designed to
 please the unsophisticated eye of the
 gilbert islanders but destined as it
 turned out never to come within a
 thousand miles of their habitat

  it was toward the evening of the
twentieth day we will say that the
wind came out of the northwest on
the heels of a spell of weather mild
and fine beyond anything in our expe-
rience we lay somewhere to the
north of new caledonia when the gale
caught us

  by gods mercy the lady of quality
lived through it shifting the seconil
day and blowing directly from the
southwest the wind whipped us help-
lessly out of our course into the east
and north for a solid week day after
day the seas pursued iis raging while
the gale swept screaming beneath a sky
like a roof of slate day after day hun-
gry exhausted and cold we fought for
our lives upon a deck swept clean of
every movable bit of gear and more
often than not knee and waist-deep
with water on the third day two of
the kanakas were washed overboard

  i have heard it said that waves never
run more than fifty feet in height pos-
sibly but judging from my own im-
pressions i should say that a hundred
and fifty were nearer the mark for
seven days i saw such walls of green
rear up behind the little schooner their
riven crests milk-white against the
skys dirty blue hanging twice and
thrice the height of our mast or so
theyseemed i have dreamed of them
since and wakened with the same clutch
at my heart the same catch at my
breath as i was used to know when
waiting for those terrific combers to
fall upon to crush and drive us shat-
tered to the bottom of the sea

  somehow they never did somehow
we won through toward noon of the
seventh day the violence of the gale
abated and brannan going by dead-
reckoning was encouraged to set more
	the popular magazine

sail and strive to bring the schooner
around toward the north i dare say
we were a couple of thousand miles
off our course and since we had been
unable to take the sun for a week our
position was naturally not only un-
known but a matter of anxiety to us
all

  but still the sea raged and spent
and weary as we were there was no
rest for us we fought all through
the night comforted only by the fact
that the wind was steadily lessening in
volume toward morning indeed it
had died to the merest whisper of a
breeze and the sky above us was clear
and shining whereupon brannan
with a sagacious eye toward the stars
swore and wore a face of trouble

  the seas abated rapidly from then
on at noon brannan took observations
and confirmed our worst fears ap-
proximately-i have no wish to be
more definite forreasons that will ap-
pear-our position was longitude 
west latitude  south we had
been blown clear of the islands of
which the nearest now were the mar-
quesas and the paumotus behind us
many hundreds of miles

  we held a council of war in the cabin
over an admiralty chart upon which
brannan had marked our position with
red ink we were in deep waters and
clear all about s the chart was dis-
figured with a pox of soundings and
cabalistic abbreviations the least depth
noted being   gt os i remem-
ber having my wonder excited and ask-
ing for an explanation of these hiero-
glyphics to which brannan replied
shortly two thousand four hundred
and seventy-five fathoms bottom
gray globigerina ooze

  i glanced at him surprised for his
manner was unusually impatient his
tone curt his face when i saw it long
and dark

  whats the trouble i asked

  faith he cricd trouble and
enough here we arre the diwle av
a ways from anywhere short-handed
and with a damaged vessel

  damaged 

  just that did ye think we could

weather a storm like thot without suf-
fering for our salvation his tone was
witheringly scornful brannan never
forgave me my misfortune that i could
not master the elements of seamanship
 murmured something deprecatory
with which for an opening brannan
caustically informed me much that i
already knew-that we had lost the
foretopsail and with it topmast and
gaff that both boats were useless
stove in by the pounding seas and that
adonis and davy jones were drowned
adding something which i had noi
known and which gave even secretan
a start-that the lady of quality had
sprung a leak and was taking in water
if not rapidly in quantity enough to fcn
disquieting

  upon receipt of this intelligence se-i
cretan who had been lolling over the
chart studying it with troubled eyes
beneath a wrinkled brow looked up hi
glasses flashing blankly in the sunlight
that fell through the companionway
and observed mildly bless my soul

  aw sure brannan hedged in-
stantly-he had ever a softer spot ir
his heart for the owner than for th
supercargo- tis nothing beyont
mending i doubt not well pull through
but tis meself would be happier wit
land nearer at hand a poort where w
cud put in to refit come anothe
blow the half av what weve had an
twill be a toss-up with the lcddy os
quality

  but this leak-when did you dis
cover it

  this marning tis nothing t
sweat about if she gains no more that
at present a couple av hours at tba
pumps night and marning will clea
the well but manewhile were short
handed and tis meself has no taste tofi
work at the pumps-nor will yersilvesl
wance yeve thried utv

  secretan turned back to the char
and the nearest land he inquired 
brannan peered over his shoulder
dominica in the marquesas he re
plied glumly with luck and fai
winds we may make ut and thit

again-

  his broken sentence was eloquent
shadow reef



 there fell a silence in the cabin ended
 at length by secretan

  whats this he demanded a
 stubby forefinger on the chart

   again brannan bent over the own-
 ers shoulder  shadder or false
 reef  he read aloud  breakers re-
 ported eighty-eight searched for
 ninety-six be his majestys ship swal-
 lozv not found 

   and how far will that be from our
 present position 

   fifty miles or more pwhy dye
 ask pwhat use is the shadder av a
 reef to the likes av us searrelied for
 and not found-isnt tlict enough for

 yev

   not altogether said secretan quiet-
 ly he continued to hold his index-fin-
 ger on the spot and i too leaned
 across the table to pick out the infor-
 mation in the admiraltys italics stream-
 ing off like a pennon from a little
 faintly marked circle in the maze of
 soundings truly enough it seemed
 to me the reef could not be far from
 the lady of quality and i gathered
 what secretan presently explained that
 his thought was to take the schooner
 there and in the shelter of the prob-
 able island anchor and refit to the best
 of our ability

   moreover he concluded his ex-
 planation if the leaks to gain on us
 and considering that we have no sea-
 worthy boats it will be as well to be
 within reach of land

   but if there is no land brannan
 objected

   drowning men i contributed my
 sententious platitude clutch at straws
 or  shadders commented bran-
 nan grimly but were not be way
 av drrowning just yet to me way av
  thinking tis a clear waste av time to
 go skallyhooting off looking for a reef
 -not so much as an island mind ye-
 that a british ship made ut htr special
 business to hunt for and didnt find

   thats john oshaughnessv bran-
 nan his mind but tis yersilfs the
 owner misther saycrctan give yer
 orders and im yours to command
 f wait a bit i suggested didnt
 i see a copy of a red book called is-

 lands of the east pacific somewhere
 around 

  ye did thot

  whywov- look it up there if
theres any other information about this

shadow or false reef-

     l mae the divvle av a fine sail-
or yit commented brannan sarcas-
tically however lie acted upon my
suggestion and presently with secretan
was poring over a broken-backed and
dog-eared copy of the admiralty pub-
lication in question-a legacy to se-
cretan from the former owner of the
lady of quality

  no intry brannan announced with
a note of triumph in his voice pwhat
did i tell ye theres no such place
and naturally enough amended
secretan closing the volume and in-
specting the back the work is of an
earlier date than the first report of the
breakers according to the chart-
eighty-seven in point of fact i think
-he leaned back in his chair and
beamed benevolently upon brannan
and myself-well have a cast for
shadow island just for luck

  well and good said the irish-
man shortly im willing to be con-
vinced but tis me prisint conviction
that this means no more than a few ex-
tra days at the pumps for all av us
yell find nothing there-beyond at
most a coral reef showing above wather
at low tide

  with that he turned on his heel and
left the cabin delivering a parting shot
in the shape of a grumbled regret that
he had ever shipped with two ignerunt
landsmin

  secretans eyes met mine and we
both smiled quietly we were well ac-
climated to the irishmans temper not
in the least disturbed by his half-
feigned disgust

  to cut the matter short crippled as
she was the lady of quality assisted
by a fair but dying breeze raised an
island out of the south pacific a little
before noon of the following day this
somewhat to brannans disgruntlement
who made it an occasion for a tirade
directed at the heads of an unconscious
and no doubt complacent british ad-


the popular magazine

iniralty its hydrographic office and the
men and officers of  m s swuliow

  there she bulks  be exclaimed as
the configuration of a low wooded
knoll surrounded by a white flashing
line of surf came into view as large
as life and steady as a rock-and barely
charted im wondering how long the
officers of that swaflozv looked for m
that they didnt find lit faith a
healthy lot av navigators they mustve
been me sowl he spat with dis-
gust

  as for secretan and myself we were
entirely too pleased with the success of
the owners plan to crow over the irish-
man we had worked two spells at the
pumps with ptarmigan and pitti sing
lifting ant sagging opposite us on the
other arm and our backs were broken
our hands blistered our arms and legs
stiff beyond belief we had scant ap-
petite for a voyage of indeterminate
len th punctuated by such exercise at
regular intervals

  moreover the sight of land is al-
ways welcome to the seafarer more es-
pecially to those who have endured days
of violent storm and strain as had sve
the four of us ptarmigan the kanaka
pitti sing the cook secretan and i
leaving brannan at the wheel clustered
forward greeting each new feature of
the island with phrases of delight as
they unfolded and were made dear to
cur eyes with the onward progress of
the schooner

  slowly enough-i have said that the
breeze was falling-we approached and
the nearer we drew the more unani-
mous was our subscription to the gen-
eral verdict voiced by secretan noth-
ing shadowy about this island

  there was first of all the coral reef
a natural circle-so far as we could as-
certain perhaps four miles in diameter
enclosing a wide and placid sheet of
water in whose center rose the island
proper the latter i should say was
two miles in length from tip to tip as
we viewed it by its tumbled profile
probably of volcanic origin with a
wooded hill rising perhaps two hundred
feet at its eastern extremity and a sec-
t id somewhat lower near the center

from ibis middle hill the ground
sloped sharply westward ending in
lowlands and a broad and shining
crescent of sandy beach

  the very place for us  secretan de-
clared with bubbling enthusiasm
there will undoubtedly be an entrance
to that lagoon and once inside we can
anchor and refit find and slop lhat leak
at our convenience-and the weather
he added forcibly be damned 

  it cant come too soon i told him
for my part im entirely willing to
stretch my legs ashore again

  if this breeze holds he returned
youll have the chance before night-
fall

  and even as he spoke the wind fell
and died without a sigh with flapping
sails and slack sheets the lady of j 
quality lost momentum and rolled idly 
upon a smooth and smiling sea a pos- i
sible five miles from shadow reef- 
near enough in fact for the thunder j
of the surf upon the natural breakwa- jj
ter to be distinctly audible in the great j
stillness that brooded

  in that dead calm the sea smoothed i
itself out in a space of time incredibly 
brief by six bells of the afternoon i
watch we floated upon a surface like
plate glass broken only by the distant 
line of white where the lazy swells fc
broke upon the barrier reef overhead j
the sky was cloudless and deep and in ip
the sea swam the reflections of a thou- h
sand coppery suns dazzling

  the heat grew all but intolerable  we 
cast longing glances at the cool green jl
slopes of the island as we loitered about j
the blistering deck following the fickle ii
shadow of the mainsail as it swung
from port to starboard and back again jj
with the rolling of the hulk

  in the course of the slow hours the j
silence became intense the thunder of jj
the surf stilling to a low murmur the i
ship resting soundless save for the all 
but inaudible lap and murmur of the 
waters beneath the quarters the slow
whining of an ungreased block or the i
more penetrating creak of the shifting i
boom toward evening as the sun de- 
dined a harsh sound arose upon the 
quietness the clank-dank of the pumpsjj
shadow reef



as we tn sweltering agony worked out
the second half of our daily stint and
with it were the gurgle and splash of
the bilge that streamed across the decks
and vomited from the scuppers in
miniature waterfalls

chapter iv
a crv in the night

  exhaustion in the natural course
followed such exertion too spent for
words we staggered from the pumps
and threw our weary bodies at length
upon the deck night fell as we lay
there lacking even ambition enough to
eat i think i must have passed into
a sort of stupor for it was four bells
-ten oclock-before i again realized
the world

 brannan was shaking me by the
shoulder here me bye i heard him
say up with ye tis not good for
ye to be lying there with the moonlight
beating down on yer face-or so ive
heard-in this climate come now

  i rose yawning rubbing my eyes
and conscious of a pang of thirst
lurched down the ladder to the cabin
secretan was there his round fat head
shining with perspiration as be stewed
over the contents of a battered old des-
patch-box wherein as i knew he kept
the ships papers and other more per-
sonal matters

  the kerosene-lamp swung in its gim-
bals above the table foul and smoky
as good as any stove in those close
walls the atmosphere reeked of
burning oil and i remember wonder-
ing dimly why secretan chose that place
and time for his business-whatever
that might be but i was too stupid
to give the matter much thought and
after pouring a bottle of warmish soda
over a stiffish dose of brandy and swal-
lowing the mixture found my pipe to-
bacco and matches and returned to the
deck

   he calm held breathless and the
world was very quiet and bright the
moon was high and near its full the
decks shone like silver and were sten-
ciled black by the sharp shadows of

sail and mast and cordage the white
canvas of the mainsail glowed lustrous
almost opalescent and even its shad-
owed side was luminous a broad ave-
nue of orange light rested all but mo-
tionless on the waters stretching nearly
to the horizon which was obscured
with haze within this misty girder the
sea lay desolate save for the lady of
quality and over the quarter the stark
black shape of shadow reef

  brannan was seated on the deck his
back to the binnacle smoking and play-
ing- with a deck of dirty and ragged
cards an interminable game of soli-
taire  an occupation which he seemed
to find fascinating i never investiga-
ted its mysteries but got the impres-
sion that he had learned the game in
some gambling-den in hongkong it
must have been profitable to the house
if the latter backed the cards against
the player for to - knowledge in all
the period of our acquaintance bran-
nan never succeeded in solving the
puzzle

  i stood for a space at the rail watch-
ing the island and then impressed that
we were somewhat nearer it than when
the calm had fallen turned to the
irishman with an observation to that
effect

  he nodded confirmation yiss he
said without removing pipe from
mouth or eyes from cards theres a
bit of a current runs eastward around
the reef i judge-nothing to worry
about

  no danger of casting us up on the
reef 

  divvle the bit besides well have
a hatful of wind before it could come
to thot or im mistaken there are
squalls off to nothard

  as he spoke a low growl of thun-
der was audible and looking in the
direction indicated i became aware of
a faint rose-colored glow just visible
above the horizon now waxing now
waning-the play of lightning re-
flected from a distant electric storm

  well i sighed it cant come too
soon to suit me im sick of those
pumps

  well be in the lagoon be sunup


the vopular magazine

ive marked the opening off there to
eastward and if we dont run on a
coral needle well be ashore at dawn
or shortly after

  as i sat myself down by the irish-
mans side taking a deal of comfort
from my pipe and the attendant sense
of peace and rest-for my slumber and
the drink had refreshed me consider-
ably- heard secretan snap the lock
of his despatch-box and scrape his
chair across the floor as he got tip from
the table a moment later lie appeared
on deck moist but cheerful

  hello he greeted us and a fine
still night if ever one was was that
thunder i heard just now

  we assured him that it was

  i didnt know-might have been
brannan grumbling you know

  dont pay any attention to him
said the irishman in an audible aside to
me  tis facetious he is and if we
give him any encouragemint tis worse
hell be moreover tis too hot to
laugli

  all right secretan chimed in you
dont have to i came on deck to talk
business with you chaps-seriously
now

  he squatted down before us and ex-
tracted a sodden gurgle from his
abominable brier schooling his coun-
tenance to a semblance of preternatural
childish wisdom

  did i ever tell you-

  yes quoth brannan shuffling the
cards yeve told us all

  oh cut it im in earnest i dont

believe i ever told you the truth-

  shurc and dont ivc know that

  -as to my late lamented uncle

  i never knew you had one i inter-
posed lazily when was lie hanged

  secretan chuckled he wasnt but
from all i can learn about him he
should have been if it hadnt been for
him i dont believe  should have been
so keen about the south seas it was
his legacy to me that put this business
into my mind-that and the advertise-
ment ive told you about

  so ye have said brannan solemn-
ly

  go on and tell us about it i en-
couraged secretan

  i rom all accounts my late lamented
uncle was an old rip-one of these
chaps that runs away to sea as a boy
falls into bad company and-all that
lie spent several years in these regions
a contemporary and associate of the no-
torious captain bully hayes-or so
they say at all events he came home
with a small fortnne chiefly in pearls
and drank himself to death on the pro-
ceeds thats all i know about my
uncle except that he died intestate
and as i was the only kin he had all
his effects and debts came to me i
settled up his bills charged his mem-
ory with  and kept his papers as
curiosities

  now continued secretan earnestly
when it came time for me to break up
my happy little home i happened to
come across an old wallet of his that
had been conveyed to me by his sor-
rowing creditors in it among other
junk i found this memorandum and
that is why i was so set on looking up
shadow reef

  while he talked secretan had been
smoothing out a bit of paper in his
hands now he handed it to me with
a what do you make of that 

  i held it up to the moonlight-which
was quite strong enough to read by-
and saw that the paper was apparently
half of the fly-leaf of some old book
near its ragged lower edge on one
side was the signature which i read
aloud of

george vaughan secretan

penned in a firm bold hand

  that was my uncles right name
explained secretan but down here
ive heard he chose to call himself

george grimes-

  not grimes the pearl pirate bran-
nan interrupted lifting his head and
putting solitaire aside for the nonce
plainly more than a little interested

  secretan grimaced but admitted that
such he believed was his dear uncles
fame and incognito

  look on the other side of the pa-
per locke he added
shadow reef

  i obeyed and found that the same
hand had written-apparently at a lapse
of years for the characters were feebler
and the ink less faded-the two words

false island

   below them were two lines of figures
 three groups to a line evidently the lati-
 tude and longitude of the island fig-
 ures which i here suppress for reasons
 that as i have said will bccome obvi-
 ous

  otherwise the paper contained a
short statement following the above

   only safe channel n w opening to
lagoon all others dangerous

  now said secretan when i had
read this aloud a clang of triumph in
his voice tell us the probable location
of shadow or false reef or island
if you prefer please mr brannan

 i couldnt hit it closer than yer
uncle announced brannan soberly
barring i take observations with the
hog-yoke to-morrow tis dear he
i added what yere driving at

   and that is  i asked interested
 enough by this time you may believe
uncle george didnt keep this
memorandum for old sakes sake said
secretan it seems patent that he had
a purpose

  oh enlightenment coming to me
buried treasure

   locke said secretan gently your
 imagination is at times singularly
 primitive and conventional

  the mans been reading treasure
j island  remarked brannan his
moinds poisoned-such as it is listen
to me and ill give ye a few details av
the loife and adventures of captain
 george grimes

   fire away said i

   i would stipulate suggested secre-
 tan mildly a certain amount of re-
 i spect for my poor uncles memory

i as your uncle me dearr sirr

 brannan chuckled he was a foine man

i but as captain grimes he was a
domned scoundrel and ive heard tell
of the toime when the pearl patrol
would have given their heads for his-
or nearly so they wanted him bad



but he was a slippery customer and
knew these islands like a book they
say no mon knew thim betther there
was not a protected reef from bur-
mah east that he hadnt taken toll av
ginerly under the very noses av the
patrol

  but in the ind they made the seas
hot even for himself and with thot he
up and disappeared and niver sight nor
sound av him was seen or heard for
the matter of three years at the ind
av which toime he was picked up near
honolulu in an open boat all alone
half dead av thirst and starvation with
a bag av pearls as big as your head and
a tale av shipwreck as long as your arm
-and much less substantial

  all of which goes to show i en-
couraged brannan as he exhibited signs
of running down

  that misther secretans uncle-
peace to his bones-had discovered a
private pearl reef all of his own
worked it until tired and then some-
how managed to lose his associates get
picked up and kape his saycret ive
been tokl that a syndicate av pearlers
sint raypresintitives from sydney to
san francisco to interview old man
grimes and buy from him the location
of his reef-twas a small forchune they
offered him and a third profits into the
bargain but he laughed at thim and
said theyd made it all up out of their
heads

  mebbe they had-mebbe not but
be this and he struck the paper in my
hand and be thot indicating the is-
land id be willing to make a small
bet at decent odds that weve stumbled

upon the very spot and if so-

  he got suddenly to his feet and i
could see that the mans face was
flushed his eyes glittering his sturdy
frame atremble with excitement

  if so he said in a tense tone
were on the threshold av our immortal
fortunes

  or secretans i cut in brutally
not so interrupted the little man
dont misjudge me gentlemen if
shadow reef be indeed what brannan
suspects-and my inclination is to
agree with him-fate has been instru-


the vopular magazine

mental in sending us three to it-for i
never should have found it save by this
accident-and-and if brannans right
and there are pearl-oysters in the la-
goon yonder well share and share
alike

  spoken like a man brannan de-
clared i ike a ginerotis gimleman but

then- the emhumxm pased out

of his manner he fell thoughtful and
disturbed

  but what inquired secretan

  im wondering if be any chance yer
sainted uncle could have failed to make
a thorough job av his--sliall we say
av the disphosal av his companions
im wondering too if no one else has
stumbled across this shadder reef be
accident all these years if theres been
any wan before us therell be little
profit in the business-me worrd for
thotr

  i think said secretan precisely
that all other circumstances consid-
ered it is extremely unlikely that the
island is inhabited or even known to
living man other than ourselves you
forget that the seas here arc supposed
to be clear save for the spot where
breakers were reported nearly twenty
years ago and the swallow-

  it is easy enough to surmise what he
was on the point of saying about the
swallow but he never concluded his
sentence the interruption wiped his
lips clean of speech

  it was a cry ringing clear and shrill
out of the strained stillness of that
night-a human voice you would have
said the wail of a man in mortal
stress inarticulate and terrible sud-
denly and unexpectedly it came and
only once it sounded an agonized
scream at first passing into a wavering
and broken moan at its fall

  you can figure for yourself the ef-
fect upon us who even in our excite-
ment had schooled our voices to little
more than whispers in unconscious
tribute to the still and solemn grandeur
of the night who were habited to the
thought that saving the kanaka and
the chinaman asleep in the forecastle
no human beings other than our three
selves existed within a radius of five

hundred miles upon those desert and
lonely seas

  a thunderbolt out ofthe blue had
not been more strange and terrifying 
for myself  am least of all a super-
stitious man yet have no hesitation in
admitting that my blood chilled my
skin crept a pricking stirred at the
roots of my hair while as fur bran-
nan and secretan  can see them now
hanging breathless upon the quaver and
fall of that uncanny shriek and when 
it had gone leaving in its place a i
soundless void infinitely more disturb-
ing than it had been before standing
motionless with ashen faces and ques-
tioning eyes

  brannan it was who first moved and i
spoke me crossed himself instinctive- jj
ly and his lips moved for a bit without
sound before words came

  mither av mercy he cried his j
brogue richer than ever and pwhats i

thotr

  iiis voice brought us out of our j
stupefaction secretan and i scrambled i
to our lcet and with the irishman j
stood staring oil across the moon-smit-
ten waters toward the island whence j
it seemed to us beyond doubt the sound ji
had emanated it was on a guess a i
full minute before either of us thought
to answer

  then secretan god knows

  aye or the divvle cried bran-j
nan roughly

   it must be some one in the island in
distress-some one shipwrecked i
hazarded my tritely obvious specula- i
tion

  naught av hiven or earth me worrd
for thot

   what then 

  god forgive me for belavin ut a
banshee-

  brannan caught my eye and smiled
in a sickly shamefaccd fashion et
laboring under such strong emotion as
he was it was easy to appreciate how
such a cry should work upon his super-
stitious celtic spirit i believe i was
little better for the moment secretan 
of us three was the first to resume out-
ward composure
shadow reef



  bosh  he said but without convic-
tion removing his glasses and abstract-
ed wiping them on a corner of his
pajama jacket no such thing dont
lets act like a trio of frightened chil-
dren it must be as locke savs

  aye cried brannan in a tremor
of contempt for my suggestion a
shipwrecked mariner is ut  thin why
lias he not built a lire or thried to at-
tract our attention before this since

noon weve lain here-

  against this reasoning secretan
found no argument

  yet on the chance of it you might
give a mhe suggested

   ti id i am to be hailing spiruts
thot was no human voice

  brannan stepped to the rail cupped
hands to mouth and lifted up his voice
-and brannan had a throat of brass
and lung of leather aho-o-oy he
cried and the bellow of it seemed to
shake the schooner yet in that heavy
silence his great voice rang flat

  and there came no answer

  the irishman turned toward us
again his face working his mind plain-
ly dominated by superstitious dread
ill get the glasses he said in a
choked voice and disappeared down the
companion-ladder in a moment he
was back binoculars in hand

  take thim he told me and tell
me pwhat ye see

  i raised the glasses to my eyes ad-
justed the focus and out of the smudge
of ptrrples and blacks shadow reef
leaped clear upon the field of the lens
again and again i swept the visible
contour of the island but saw nothing
at length giving it up as a profitless em-
ployment and saying as much

  ye see cried the irishman with a
thrill in his voice marrk me worrds
twas a banshee keening the death av
one av us-shure death twill be if we
set foot upon that shore 

  oh rot ejaculated secretan
come below and have a drink its
dollars to doughnuts that it was some
bird or beast wait till to-morrow and
ill show you your banshee and i say
brannan dont forget what my uncle
said about the open channel thats a
good thing to remember pearls are
pearls and i can use my share of them
if we get any but ive no particular
anxiety to maroon myself even in good
company on this bit of land

  a thoroughly sensible little body he
was at times-secretan  and now he
kept up a continual flow of inconse-
quent chatter meanwhile persuading
brannan to accompany him to the cabin
a generous brandy and soda put a new
light into tlie irishmans eyes but by
tacit consent we avoided the subject of
that strange cry for the rest of the eve-
ning

to be concluded in january number

pigeons can carry libraries

a pigeon-fancier will tell you that in war-time the carrier-pigeon per-
forms wonders in the way of swift traveling and sure delivery of mes-
sages but it is possible for pigeons to carry more than merely the brief
messages they usually do they are able to carry quite nice little libraries

    the secret of this seemingly impossible feat is microscopic photography
the messages are first printed in ordinary type and then reduced by photographv
several hundred times the photographs are taken on thin films or policies of
collodion each of which though it is less than two inches square can thus con-
tain  words

    of these pellicles a pigeon can easily carry a dozen without interfering with
its comfort or speed but a pigeon has carried as much as three-quarters of an
ounce for a short distance this weight would represent something like 
messages or  words so that under these conditions it would be quite
possible for a pigeon to carry a small library of  volumes

      modern commercialism its terrible ruthlessnear the strange

      in the fight in which there is no quarter are well illustrated
      in this story which is at one and the same time a

                                    -hiawatha

his story has been
blamed for its lack of
a moral people seem
to expect one so to put
to the rack the facts in
the case that they will
shriek out some well-
tried message some
have behaved as if they thought the
moral here but faulty colonel loree
of the solar selling company how-
ever thinks the affair rich in the luc-
fabitla-docet element so does william-
son solidting-agent for the mid-conti-
nent life and so-emphatically so-
does the mid-continent itself tru-
deau the breed guide has had so
few years in which to turn it over in
his slow-moving mind as he has lain
rolled in his blankets while the snow
sifted through the moaning pines that
he has not made up his mind as for
foster van dorn and gwendolyn their
opinions-but the story itself is not
long

  williamson says that when he left
van dorns office with the application
he was as near walking on air as in-
surance men ever are people had
been so slow in writing their auto-
graphs on the dotted line-and here
was a six-figure application with a
check these accompanied by the
wide-eyed williamson exploded into

the mid-december calm of the agency
headquarters like the news of a tono-
pah strike in the poker-playing ennui
of a poverty flat

  whats that williamson ejacu-
lated the cashier five hundred-
you domt mean thousand

  why confound you  sneered will-
iamson look at that application

  let me see it panted the manager 
bursting in foster g van dorn 
half a million holy cat williamson
but this will put you and the agency in

the lead for- is he good for it

wiiliamson 

  why dont you see that checkv
inquired the lofty solicitor i tell you
fellows theres always a way to land
any man why fur a year ive-by
george im forgetting to send doctor
watson over lo make the examination j
van dorns going on a hunting trip i
and weve got to hustle and get him j
nud before he goes

  the manager stood by williamson i
during the telephoning who is mr
van dorn  he asked as the agent
hung up the receiver

  president of the kosmos chemical
company replied williamson son-
in-law and enemy of colonel loree of
the solar selling company you know
said the cashier

  oh-h-h-h replied the manager as
the stalking of vauguk



if recalling something i remember
the romance in the newspapers but i
thought the young fellow was poor
fixed it up with the colonel i suppose
-the usual thing

  not on your life replied william-
son loree would kill him if he dared
-old aristocrat you know but van
dorns too smart for him you re-
member he was an engineer for lorees
company and met the daughter on
some inspection trip love at first sight
-moonlight  the mountains-run-
away and wedding on the sly-fathers
curse-turned out to starve and all
that

 i remember that answered the
manager but it doesnt seem to lead
logically up to this application

 well went on williamson van
dorn turns up with a company formed
to work a deposit of the sal-ammoniac
or asphaltum or whatever the stuff the
solar company had cornered may be
and began trust-busting the colonel
swore the new deposit really belonged
to his company because van dorn
found it while in his employ and called
him all sorts of a scoundrel but the
young mans gone on all the same
floating his company and flying high
i heard that loree was sure to ruin
him interposed the cashier

 ruin nothing said williamson
it was a case of the whale and the
swordfish van dorns got him licked
-why dont you see that check

  that does look like success replied
the manager i hope his strenuous life
hasnt hurt his health-watson is fussy
about hearts and lungs

  thats the least of my troubles re-
plied williamson van dorns an ath-
lete and a first-class risk theres
nothing the mattter with van dorn 

  and yet trudeau the guide far up
in the minnesota woods looked at the
young man and wondered at his be-
havior they had come by the old
tote-road to the deserted lumber-
camp armed and equipped to hunt deer
most young men in van dorns situa-
tion were keen-eyed eager for the trail
and the chase-at least until tamed by

weariness but van dorn was like a
somnambulist once trudeau had left
him behind on the road and on re-
tracing his steps to find him had dis-
covered him standing by the path ga-
zing at nothing his lips slowly moving
as if repeating something under his
breath-and he had started as if in
fright at trudeaus hail he had been
careful to give trudeau his card and
admonished him to keep it but he
seemed careless of all opportunities of
following up the acquaintance most
of these city hunters were anxious to
talk but what troubled trudeau was
the manner in which van dorn sat by
the lire wrote in a book from time to
time and gazed into the flames now
that they had reached the old camp
trudeau hoped that actual hunting
would bring to his mans eyes the fire
of interest in the thing he had come so
far to enjoy

  ill fix up camp said he if you
like you hunt big par tie chicageau
men ove by lake-keep othe way

  flow far to their camp asked the
fire-gazer

   bout two-mile answered tru-
deau

mebbe six she have car on track

cried van dorn

  qui yes replied trudeau you
know heem

  no said van dorn

  the man who did not know loree
went to his knapsack and took out a
jacket made of deerskin tanned with
the hair on it was lined with red
flannel he held it up and looked at
it fixedly trudeau started as it met
his gaze and he came up to van dorn
and pointed to the garment

  you wear zat  asked he

  yes said the other it is a good
warm jacket

  a man wat wear deerskin zha-
quette said trudeau ineese wood

van dorn his lips parting with a
mirthless smile

  it goes either side out said the
hunter i can turn it you know

  i turn heem said trudeau suiting
the action to the word red is bet-
taire by gosh-in zese wood

  trudeau watched his companion as
lie made hi laborious way through the
cut-over chaos until he disappeared but
he did not see him pause when out of
sight of camp and turn toward the
lake

  i would rather it were any one
ele said van dorn as if to some-
thing that walked by his side but what
difference does it make why not let
him finish his work 

  the sheer difficulty of the country
brought back to van dorn something
like the foresters alertness the lust
for lumber had ravaged the spiry for-
est and left inextricably tangled the
wrecks of the noble trees-forest maid-
ens whose beauty had been their de-
struction only the crooked and ugly
having escaped so deep and complex
was the wreckage that it seemed like
the spilikins of a giants ganfe of jack-
straws-gnarled logs limbs like che-
vaux-de-frisc saplings and underbrush
growing up through chaos and spread
over and sifted through all was the
snow as light as down

  van dorti must have told the truth

as to his former visits for he went on
hke one used to tiiiv terrible irnrr no- i

where could he take three step straight
forward it was always climbing un
or leaping down or going around or
crawling under here thick leaves up-
held the snow and in the dry pine straw
on the ground he could hear the forest
mice rustle and scurry there a field
was smoothed over by the snow as a
trap is hidden by sand covering debris
just high enough to imperil the limbs
of the pedestrian yonder was a tama-
rack swamp too thick to be pierced
and everywhere it was over and under
and up and down and desperately hard
for miles and miles with no place for
repose

  lie gazed away over the strange
abomination of desolation blindly re-
flecting upon mans way  coming do-
ing his worst anl passing on with
sated appetite leaving ruin-as he had
done here he wondered why that tall
tract of virgin pine over at the right
had been allowed to escape standing
against the sky like a black wall spiked
with tall rampikes he stared fixedly
at the snow the blue shadows the black
pines somnambulistic again

  to the something that seemed to walk
by his side he spoke of these things
as if it had been visible strange ac-
tions strange thoughts for the president
of the kosmos chemical company the
great antagonist of loree of the solar
selling company the david to lorees
goliath the swordfish to the colonels
whale think however of david with
all the stones spent against the giants
buckler and cowering within the lethal
teach of that spear like a weavers
beam or of the swordfish with broken
weapon hunted to the uttermost black
depths bv the oncoming silent yawning
destruction and in van dorns case
the enemy was an avenger as well as
a natural foe

  poor little kosmos chemical com- 
pany with its hig name its great de-
posits of a prime commercial neces-
sity-see prospectus-its dependence
on railways with which loree was on i

  to snatch victory from the jaws of de-
  feat raging for the loss of his cvve
  lamb whom notwithstanding his giant-
  ship he had loved lor twenty years to
  van dorns two and had dreamed
  dreams and committed crimes for not
  very strange after all perhaps that the
  man went on muttering somnambulistic-
  ally they say that one gripped in the
  lions mouth is numb and filled with de-
  lusions

    suddenly putting life into the dead

	scene a bounding form came into view
  pasta thicket-a noble buck with many-
  pointed antlers moving with great de-
  liberate leaps among the giants spili-
  kins the delicate glassy hoofs the
  slender brittle limbs and horns fragile
  as china seemed courting destruction in
  those terrific entanglements yet the
  beautiful animal as if by some magic
  levitation rose lightly from a perilous
  crevice between two logs turned
  smoothly in mid-leap struck the four
  pipe-stem limbs into the only safe
  landing-place shot thence with ar-
  rowy spring between two bayonetlike
  branches to another foothold and so
  on and on every rod of progress a
  miracle

   ite stopped snuffing the air in-
  stinctively the hunter leveled his rifle
  and then came into view the bucks
  retinue two does one large and ma-
  tronly the other a last summers fawn
  the sleep-walkers eyes softened the
  rifle swung downward from the point-
  blank aim snapping a twig in its de-
  scent and with swift mighty bounds
  the deer vanished putting a clump of
  bushes between themselves and the foe
  with unerring strategy

    toward the lake said the hunter
  ill follow

   there came the report of a distant
  rifle from the direction of the deers
  flight then another and another some
  one was working a repeater rapidly
  the hunter stopped took off his deer-
  skin jacket turned it hair side out and
  like a soldier making for the firing-line
  pressed forward after the deer

   trudeau saw his man halt on the
 edge of the firelight that evening turn
 his jacket and come weariedly into

 camp trudeau sat and thought that
 night while the other slept heavily
 next morning there was a raging
 storm and the guide was puzzled that
 the hunter refused to brave its dangers
 it was not sure then that monsieur de-
 sired the wooden overcoat he told
 van dorn many stories of death in
 these storms and watched for the ef-
 fect

 an mebbe nevaire know if he is vidow
 or not

   it would be better said the other
 reflectively to have the proof ample-
 ample

  trudeau pondering over this
 watched his charge putting names in
 a book opposite amounts in figures but
 lie did not know that here was the lost
 fortune of an old aunt there the sav-
 ings of a college chum van dorn
 looked them over calmly as if it lid
 been a bills-payable sheet to be paid
 in the morning then the strange
 pleasure-hunter began writing a letter
 to a sweetheart to whom he seemed
 to be able to say only that he loved
 her better than life that she must try
 to love his memory and to train upthe
 baby to respect his name that the right
 thing is uot always easy to discern that

	sometimes one has only a choice of
 evils that when a man has made a
 mess of it which he can straighten out
 by stepping off the stage he might as
 well do it-and that he had had his
 share of happiness since she had been
 with him anyhow and was lar ahead of
 the game trudeau could not know
 what a foolish silly tragic letter it was
 this product of insane commercialism
 he thought life and the woods enough
 and wondered at the shaking of the
 mans shoulders and was amazed to see
 the tears dropping through his fingers
 as he bowed his head upon his hands-
 a man with a fifty-dollar sleeping-bag

   over at the loree headquarters there
 were roaring fires fresh venison a skil-
 ful chef jolly companions and the per-
 fection of camp-life the storm cleared
 that strong old hunter loree declaring
 that his business was to stalk deer


the popular magazine

marched off in the solitary quest which
is the only thing that brings the
haunch to the spit in the minnesota cut-
over forest he was bristly bearded
keen of eye and vigorous handled his
gun cannily and craftily negotiated the
fallen and tangled timbers his glance
sweeping every open vista for game
there was no time to think of anything
but the making of his way and of the
chase troubles and triumphs retired
to the outer verge of consciousness
primeval problems claimed his thoughts
and the primeval man rose to meet
them it was in this ancient and ef-
fective wise that he had sharpened his
weapons set his snares and hunted
down foster van dorn-and left him
in the money-jungle apparently unhurt
but really smitten to the heart and stag-
gering to his fall it was the loree
way as an old hunter he knew just
where his shaft had struck and how
long the quarry could endure the hemor-
rhage had he not said that the fellow
should be made to rue the loree dis-
pleasure 

  like a flash these half-thoughts be-
came no thoughts as a dark blotch
caught his eye far off on the snow
beyond a little thicket

  what is that lie said to himself
it is a little hard to say but the mat-
ter is worth looking into just the color
of a deer just where a deer would
rest we must work up the wind a
little closer for some men are so fool-
ish as to wear those duns and browns
but that-that is a deers coat it
wont do to jump him and trust a shot
as he goes-those firs will hide him at
the first leap a long shot at a stand-
ing target-there he moved  theres
not a second to lose

  a long shot truly but that graceful
rifle thinks nothing of half a mile
there are many intervening bushes and
saplings but the steel-jacketed bullet
would kill on the farther side of the
thickest pine and even a soft-nosed one
will cut cleanly lo this mark the colo-
nels practised left hand immovably sup-
ported the barrel the colonels keen eye
through the carefully adjusted sights
saw plainly the blotch of deerskin down

the little glade and the colonels steady
forefinger confidently pressed the lightly
set trigger spat the colonel felt
the rifleman s delicious certitude that
his bullet had found its mark threw in
another shell and stood tensely ready
to try the bisecting of the smitten deers
first agonized bound-but the blur of
fur just stirred a little and slipped
down out of sight

   panting in the killers frenzy loree
struggled over the debris to reach his i
game how oddly the deer had fallen 
heart or brain likely as it went down
like a log here was the thicket and
on the other side-yes a patch of red- j
dencd snow and ihe body of-no not i
a deer but a man dead it seemed clad i
in a deerskin jacket a rifle by his side i
and in his hand a note-book full of 
figures its pages all stained and crum-
pied

   there was a shout in the far distance 
but loree heard it not he knew his i
solitude and never looked for aid the i
white strangeness of the face of the i
man he had shot overcame the sense of 
something familiar in it and the colo- i
nel after a moments scrutiny of it i
addressed himself frantically to the i
stanching of the blood a deep groan i
seemed to warrant hope and stooping i
beneath the body loree took it up and i
began bearing ii toward the camp he v
had an overwhelming consciousness of i
the terrible task before him but the i
realization of the human life dashed i
out some home blasted some infinity of i
woe and the bare chance of rescue i
rolled sickeningly over him and lie set i
his teeth and attacked the task like an i
incarnate will	i

  logs and boughs and dead-wood held j
him back countless obstacles exhausted i
him lie felt like crying out in agony j
as he realized that his age was telling i
against him he felt strangely tender
at this meeting with death in its simple i
and more merciful form he clenched jj
his teeth hard felt his heart swell as i
if to burst his lungs labor in agonized
hcavings-and when trudeau the guide
overtook him he found him a irenzied
man covered with dark streaks and
splashes of blood unconquerably luiri-

h

irg upon his impossible task his last
reserves of strength with all that iron
resolution with which he had beaten
clown resistance in his long- battle with
a relentless world

    for gods sake he panted hoarsely
  help me get him to camp weve got
  a doctor there j

    hows the colonel  said the doctor
  when he had done all he could for the
  colonels victim

    knocked all to pieces answered a
  young man wants to know if weve
  found out who the man is

    colonel loree was interrogating tru-
  deau  surprised that he did not know
  the name of the wounded man

    non answered trudeau she tell
  me his name and give me carte but i
  lose heem an forget firs day re-
  member wood remember trail remem-
  i ber face ver well-but name she i
  forget she write lettaire an cry an

 all time put fig in book zis is heem
  mebbe she tell name

   the smutched names were strange
  to the colonel but on another page
  there were some inexplicable references

	to kosmos chemical affairs and on
  the cover were dim initials that looked

 like f v d

    i know somesing is wrong went

    heres a letter we found in his
 pocket said the young man look at

    the colonel looked saw his daugh-
r tors name remembered the familiar
 look in the white agonized pitiful face

i and saw the whole situation as by some
baleful flash-light

    good god  good god he cried
  its van dorn  get things ready to
  carry him in his bed to the car-quick
  johnson  and get to the wire as soon



as you can have tibbals bring gwen-

needed-look after things right john-
son for i think-i think-im going
mad old man 

  mrs van dorn ran into her fathers
arms in the hospital anteroom through
mazes of frenzied anxiety she felt an
epoch open in her life with that em-
brace from the father who had put her
out of his life forever as they thought

  dear dear papa she whispered
let me go to foster quick

not just now gwennie little girl
said he patting her shoulder hes

no no i thought-but foster
cried gwendolyn will he-will he

  hell live by heaven cried the
colonel i fired one fool for hinting
that he wouldnt and now theyre all

   the colonel reached for his handker-
chief much hampered by gwendolyns
arms

  and when hes well said he i

gwennie 

   to this point had the appeal of con-
crete piteous need brought colonel
loree the ferocious whose heart had
never once softened while he did so
much more cruel things than the mere
shooting of van dorn it broke
gwendolyns heart afresh

   oh dont papa  she cried i cant

against you  ill be on your side hes
generous papa-he wanted to name
baby loree-and oh i must go to him
papa i cant wait
 the rue montera mystery

  by f goron ex-chief of the paris detective police
  edited by albert keyzer

     monsieur tiorons methods in crime detection may be said to consist in an
acute receptivity to impressions a dependence on ewift intuitions rather than
jumping at conclusions and forcing of issues his wonderful successes as head
of the greatest police force in the world surely justify his processes the
stories of actual cases in his career make most interesting reading this is
the third ol a very popular series	

ew crimes have aroused
more consternation in
paris than the murder
of madame dellard a
lady of high standing
found with her throat
cut in her apartment
 boulevard du tem-
ple and excitement reached boiling-
point when it became known that the
man i arrested three weeks later as the
presumed murderer was an army lieu-
tenant called anastey who subsequent-
ly acknowledged his guilt and was guil-
lotined

  the case however gave me endless
trouble and whilst i was still battling
with that difficult problem i received
an earlv telephonic call to come at once
to the rue montera a street close to
the porte de vincennes i jumped in-
to a cab and when i arrived at the
address given me a detached house
with a little garden in front i saw a
crowd blocking the road and two po-
licemen at the gate as i walked up
the small gravel path to the house a
police inspector came out and said

   am so glad you came at once sir
none of us can make head or tail of
this business

  he opened the door of a room on the
ground floor and there was an old

lady her face blanched with fright sit-
ting- in an easy chair her maid terror-
stricken was by her side from a room
opposite came the confused noise of
voices

  addressing the old lady the police
inspector said 

  madame maillard here is monsieur
goron youd better tell him yourself
what happened

  but madame maillard could only
bring out inarticulate sounds and tht
inspector turned to the servant with
the remark

  it may take some time before your
mistress is quieted lown in the mean-
time you can give monsieur goron an
account of the affair

  the girl wiped her eyes and in a
trembling voice began

  yesterday afternoon toward five
mademoiselle brrnet came to pay my
mistress a visit the ladies are related
whilst i was peeling mv potatoes ma-
dame maillard came into my kitchen
and told me that mademoiselle brunet
would stay here the night whereupon
i put the little spare room-the one
on the right hand when you come in--
in order at ten oclock t accompanied
madame maillard to her bedroom on
the floor above to help her undress on
my return to my kitchen madame
the rue mont era mystery

u

brunet called out for a glass of water
ani i brought her a siphon and a tum-
bler which i placed on the night-table
half an hour later i went to bed this
nomine at six i came down-stairs and
passing the young ladys room thought
i heard a low moan i listened a mo-
ment and knocked there came no re-
ply and  softly turned the handle but
the door was locked i aain waited a
few seconds and when the moan was
repeated i beat the door with my fist
and shouted

  mademoiselle is anything the
matter please open the door

  again there was no response and
i woke madame maillard we both
hammered at the door without any re-
sult we then burst it open rushed in
and nearly fainted with fright from
below the bed protruded the head and
shoulders of a man covered in blood 
and no trace of madame brunet
i ran for the police they are now in
the other room with the doctor and the
ma-man-- the rest of the sen-
tence was lost in a hysterical fit o
crying

  i went into the passage and opened
the door of the spare room a tall
military-looking man was bending over
a figure on the sofa by his- side on
a chair were a case of surgical instru-
ments and a basin with water and
towels two policemen stood near the
door i beckoned to them to leave the
room after a few minutes when the
doctor had finished attending to his pa-
tient he turned to me

   this seems an inexplicable business
monsieur goron he said pointing to
the man lying senseless on the sofa

   he is not dead  i asked

  no but it will be touch-and-go
with him there is a fracture of the
skull and i fear it will be a case of
trepanning he has received a tre-
i mendous blow probably with that
 and he pointed lo a hood-stained si-
phon on the floor near the bed

  f looked at the man he had a com-
mon expressionless face partly cov-
 jered with sandy whiskers and wore a
check suit of a loud pattern with well-
i made patent-leather shoes that con-

trasted strangely with the vulgar en-
semble i was certain i had never seen
him before

   calied up the police inspector and
in his presence searched the mans
pockets we found a purse with about
forty francs in gold and silver a cig-
arette-case a worn pocket-knife and a
small revolver of a strange make but
no papers of any description

  the inspector and the doctor smiled
when we came upon the revolver

  that tells its own tale said the
officer with an ominous glance

  at that moment the ambulance car-
riage for which the doctor had sent
drove up and i made out an order for
the mans removal to the infirmary of
the depot the doctor and a policeman
accompanied him

  as soon as the carriage with the
white hag and red geneva cross had
driven oft i asked the inspector to give
me an account of what he saw on his
arrival

  when i entered the room sir he
began the man was lying face down-
ward unconscious half his body under
the bed i took care that nothing was
disturbed the siphon is lying exactly
on the same spot and that chair near
the window was knocked over there
is still the mans hat under the bed

  you found the window open of
course 

  yes as to the man i am certain
 had him in custody three years ago
whilst i was in the passy district he
was arrested along with four others
who had been found loitering in that
neighborhood on two of them we
found jimmies and revolvers similar
to the one he carried hes an old of-
fender sir but who struck him that
blow and what has become of the
girl it looks an ugly business  

  i made a careful examination of the
room the bedclothes showed that
mademoiselle brunet had not slept
in the bod very long except on the
small carpet in front of the bed there
were no traces of blood anywhere nor
did i detect any signs of a struggle
as the doctor had said the blood-
stained siphon had evidently been the


the <1>pular magazine

weapon with which the man had been
hit i drew out the soft felt hat from
under the bed and laid it on the table
suddenly the inspector called out
hello and he held up a gray
cloth cap he had picked up near the
window

  this confirms my suspicions he
continued the fellow had some of his
confederates with him one of them i
remember had a remarkably big head
just look at the size of this cap

   i examined the cap and then said

   it strikes me that it belongs not to
a big man but to a woman with a small
head-a cyclist probably you did not
notice the tiny holes in the lining
caused by the hatpins with which the
cap was fastened

  i continued my search but finding
nothing that could throw any more
light on the affair i returned to the
room where i had left madame mail-
lard although still much upset she
was now able to give me a few details

   alice brunet is my niece she said
 in reply to my question t had not
seen her for over a year and yesterday
morning she wrote that she would come
to spend the afternoon with me she
arrived rather late and told me she
wanted to travel that same night to
rouen feeling tired however she
changed her mind and asked to be al-
lowed to stay the night here we all
went to bed at ten oclock and this

morning early ihe maid-

  yes i interrupted she told me
what occurred this morning i want to
know a little more about mademoiselle
brunet your servant referred to her
twice as mademoiselle and twice as
madame is she married or single
the old ladys pale checks flushed
slightly and she hesitated a moment
before replying

  she is divorced vhc remarked in
a low voice and has resumed her
maiden name of brunet she has seen
trouble

  you saw the man do you remem-
ber ever having met him before

  to monsieur goron hes an ut-
ter stranger lo me a few years ago
they tried to break into this house and

once some washing left to dry in the
garden was stolen but this attempted j
burglary terrifies me and what can 
have become of my niece

  did your niece bring a bag with 
her when she came

  yes a small leather bag and 

  at that moment there was a noise of
quick steps on the gravel walk out- j
side the door flew open and a young i
lady rushed in who threw her arms j
round madame maillards neck

  auntie she cried here i am fij
was too dreadful i wonder i have
not gone mad

  she dropped into a chair and cov-
ered her face with her hands

  madame maillard knelt beside her i
and gently stroked her hair

  poor alice she whispered sooth-
ingly thank the lord you are safc
i dreaded they had killed you but
where do you come from what lias
happened here is monsieur goroni
who has come to investigate the af-
fair

  alice brunet stared at me a moment
she was a good-looking fair-haired
woman with brilliantly white teeth and
a determined almost hard expression
in the eyes the expression of a woman
with immense power for self-restraim
and who had fought some hard battles

  she made an effort to compose her-
self and began

  last night after i had retired ti
my room i asked rose for a glass of
water whereupon she brought me a
siphon and a tumbler which she placed
on the little table near me  had had
a busy day and after i had undressed
i sat up in bed thinking i dozed off
but as i cannot sleep with a light in
the room i soon woke up and was just
going to blow out my candle when i
heard a creaky noise underneath my
bed i held my breath and listened
the noise grew more distinct and 
even fancied hearing suppressed breath-
ing at that moment i remembered j
had not closed my window i always
sleep with my window open but here
on a ground floor it was madness anti
i felt i had done a foolish thing to
frightened to call out i leaned forward
r

the rue montera mystery	i

 and to my horror saw a hand come
 from under the bed presently a bushy
 head emerged how did it all happen 
 all i know is that i seized the siphon
 and brought it down on the head be-
 low by the flickering light of the can-
 dle i fancied i saw the room filled with
 men aiming blows at me i felt stunned
 as if it had been i who had been struck
 had i killed him the figure was
 lying motionless-i dared not look at
 it a deadly sickness overcame me yret
 urged to get away from what was ly-
 ing there at my feet i fastened my
 clothes on me jumped out of the win-
 dow and ran out of the gate straight
 ahead how long did i run  i can-
 not tell morning was breaking and
 i was still speeding along exhausted
 and sore i finally found myself on the
 road to pontoise i entered a little inn
 swallowed a cup of coffee and having
 tidied myself returned here as fast
 as i could

    she paused an instant and with the
  same fixed look turned to me

   but what happened here did vou

 find the--

    yes i replied the man was found
on the floor and i had him removed to
i the infirmary

   he is-not dead

there was a tiny spark of life in
him when they took him away it may
i have flickered out now you hit him
 pretty hard is his face at all familiar
 to you mademoiselle brunet

   i only saw the back of his head
 when i struck him and afterward i

	was too nervous to look

    in that case i must ask you to go
with me to the infirmary no not
now i must first know how our man
i is getting on where do you live
no t rue laugier

    ery well one more question
 please is this your cap and i pro-
 duced the one found in her room

    es i generally use it when cycling
  in the country i thought i had lost
  it

 here was a rattle of wheels a
cab drove up to the gate a man quick-
f lv jumped out and i recocrnized plin
one of my most experienced assistants

he had come to report on a special
matter and i went with him into the
garden when he had finished i told
him in a few words what had occurred
here and said

  i must leave now you must man-
age to keep mademoiselle brunet here
for another half-hour

  plin eyed me curiously

  what do you make of the business
sir

  the police inspector in this district
swears he knows the fellow who he
says belongs to a gang of cracksmen
quite so but whats your opinion
sir did any special points strike
you 

  many points struck me as to my
opinion i think it is a deep business
a devilish deep business and now i
am off

  toward four oclock that same after-
noon i went to the depot infirmary and
inquired from the chief surgeon how
our man was progressing

  that fellow he said must have
his soul riveted to his body the blow
he received would have killed an av-
erage man he is still unconscious
but we hope to bring him round the
pressure on the brain seems less strong
common burglar eh 

  looks liie it the moment he ral-
lies let me know

  for four days the man hovered be-
tween life and death  and as by that
time i had been fortunate enough to
arrest anastey madame dellards mur-
derer i could devote a little time to
the rue montera affair apart from
a rather important fact i had brought
to light after i had left madame mail-
lards i had also made a few inquiries
about alice brunet and learned that
jean richard her husband had been
convicted of forgery after her di-
vorce she had acted as secretary to a
man called fenoux insurance-broker
stock-brokers tout and news-agent
despite the imposing brass plate on his
office door fenouxs business did not
appear to prosper for six months ago
he owed his landlord two quarters
rent suddenly however he had come
into money he now had a comforta-

ble apartment in the avenue tie mes-
sine and couid be seen every day in
ihe bois driving a fine pair of bays
alice brunet was no longer in his em-
ploy

  plin who assisted me in my inquiries
in the rue de mont era a hair came to
me on the morning of the fifth day
with the news that the man duval
was out oi danger and that the head
surgeon had just sent for me it was
one of rims peculiarities whenever
we arrested an individual of whose
identity we were not certain plin
christened him duval until his real
name had transpired when-as it
frequently happened-we had several
duvals on our hands the resource-
ful plin overcame the difficulty by call-
ing them the tall duval the pock-
marked duval etc

   found duval in a little room by
himself in a quiet part of the building
the head surgeon and three other doc-
tors were examining him attentively
a nurse was standing at the foot of the
bed

  it is the strangest case that has ever
come our way whispered the chief
unless complications arise-which 
dont foresee-he will be on his legs in
less than no time he will still be weak
from loss of blood but with his splen-
did physique his strength will soon re-
turn poor wretch recovery for
him probably means a long term of im-
prisonment i suppose lie is an old
jail-bird 

  possibly-i dont know him others
say they do can i bring mademoiselle
brunet here to have a look at him

  yes you had better come with her
to-morrow whilst he is still uncon-

scious

  i sent word to mademoiselle brunet
and the next morning we entered the
sick mans room he was lying with
his eyes shut

  do you know him i asked

  she shivered as she gazed at the
pallid figure and her face grew white
then she shook her head

  no she said i never saw him be-
fore

  you arc quite certain

  quite

  in that case i need not detain you

any further

  the chief surgeons prognostication
came true his patient rallied wonder-
fully and  therefore asked the an-
thropometrical office to take hirn in
hand- monsieur bertillon took his
measurements but he informed me the
next day that our man had never
passed through their office

  no he said he is not one of our
customers

  nor did any of my men recognize
him except gallois who backed the po-
lice inspectors opinion by stating that
he had seen duval in company with
brizard a burglar recently sentenced
to seven years transportation

  a few days later accompanied by
plin i again went to the infirmary

  you can now have a chat with
him said the surgeon that is to say
if you ccji make hirn talk he is as
well as can be expected and by the end
of next week he can be handed over
to the authorities

  has he spoken at all

  very little he replies to my ques-
tions regarding his condition and asks
for any trifle he may want

i found him silting up in bed read-
ing a novel the doctor had lent him
what is your name i asked

  he remained silent

  why did vou go to madame mail-
lards 

  there was no response

  i suppose you know that when you
leave this place you will be charged
with a serious offense and probably in-
cur a severe sentence

  he made a slight motion with the
hand

  you must alo be aware that if once
handed over to the examining magis-
trate he may keep you under remand
for a very long time before sending
you for trial tf therefore-which is
possible-you went to the house in the
rue montera without a felonious in-
tent now is the moment for you to
speak

  the man raised himself on one elbow
the rue montera mystery



  and looked me straight in the face
  thre came however no reply

    when did you leave montreal i
  suddenly asked

    this time he gave a start and a hag-
  gard expression came into his eyes
  for a few seconds he appeared to
  waver and his lips moved as if he in-
  tended to speak then with an im-
  patient gesture he pulled the bed-
  clothes over his shoulders and turned
  his face to the wall

    it was useless to prolong the inter-
  view when we emerged into the
  streets i noticed that plin looked at me
  inquiringly

    i reckon my question about mont-
  real puzzles you  i asked

    it does sir how did you work it
  out

oh it was very simple when i
searched his pockets in the rue mon-
tera i also examined his linen and
clothes his shirt and pocket-handker-
l chief were marked s but the name of
 the maker did not appear on his clothes
i then looked at the brass buttons of his
trousers they were quite plain with
 the exception of one which with the
 help of a magnifying-glass i saw was
 stamped montreal i cut it off put it
i in my pocket and aimed a random shot
t with it as it happened it told and
a may give me a clue

    i dare say grinned plin youll
i ferret it all out right enough before
 that fellow leaves the hospital i sup-
 pose you see your way already pretty
i clear

no and that is the trouble i have
r come to a few curious conclusions but
 they have to be tested judges and
 jurymen are rarely psychologists it
is not to be expected of them a man
lies hidden beneath a bed pie is dis-
af covered by a ladv and she half kills
him she had a right to do it-in self-
 defense the man refuses to make any
statement or to disclose his identity
jlthc legal machinery is then set into
n motion the examining magistrate will
tell the accused that he is a common
burglar and commit him for trial sev-
eral members of the force will swear
that he is an associate of criminals the

jury will convict him and the judge
having passed sentence will compli-
ment the lady on her pluck and thank
her for haying brought a dangerous
offender to justice and were any one
to come forward and tell them that they
have all been mystified he would be
laughed at luckily i have still a week
to look into what no doubt they will
call a clear case 

  the next few days however brought
nothing but disappointments i had
wanted to know a little more about the
wonderful fenoux and was informed
that he had left for new york a week
before the rue montera affair i had
sent photographs of the man in the in-
firmary in every direction but none of
my french or foreign colleagues had
recognized him as to mademoiselle
brunet the reports about her were pro-
vokingly good

  monsieur goron  have known that
young woman for years said the po-
lice commissary in her district and i
can assure you she is hard-working
and respected by all that business
with her husband was a terrible trial
to her he had a big salary but he
forged his employers name and all
his money was squandered on the turf
i thought the matter carefully over
and tried to arrive at a definite con-
clusion why did that fellow refuse
to speak what reason had he for al-
lowing himself to be charged with at-
tempting a burglary if-as i felt cer-
tain-he had come to the house for an-
other purpose  but in that case he
would have to divulge a secret what
secret i felt equally certain that not-
withstanding her denial mademoiselle
brunet was well acquainted with the
man she nearly sent into the other
world yet in the face of these two
people-the only actors in this strange
business-remaining silent i could
hardly expect to arrive at the truth
for a moment  even felt tempted to let
events follow their course but as i
knew that this unsolved problem would
only weigh on my mind i resolved to
play my last card and i sent to
mademoiselle brunet asking her to call
on me


the popular magazine

  she looked very pretty in a smartly

cut tailor costume

  mademoiselle i began excuse me
if i put a question i asked you already
do you know the man found concealed

in your room 

  no monsieur goron

  you never met him before
  never

  could you swear to that fact

  i came here to give you all the in-
formation i can and you have no right
to doubt my word 

  very well we may come back to
that later now allow me another
question you told me how having
struck the man you walked about all
night half dazed is that a fact

  she rose from her chair and made a
step toward me

  what do you mean she gasped
what i mean is that i do not like
being bluffed and you have-pardon
me for saying so-tried the experiment
on me please sit down and listen
quietly for what i have to tell you is
pretty serious your description of
your flight from the room and your
nocturnal promenade until you found
yourself on the road to pontoise was
intensely dramatic it would have a
tremendous success in a court of jus-
tice and draw tears from everybody
but it failed to impress me that
story somehow did not sound real and
the whole tirade-as far as i was con-
cerned-had a contrary effect it
aroused my suspicions i therefore
left your aunts house hurriedly went
straight to the rue tangier placed a
blank piece of paper in an envelope on
which i wrote your name and sent a
little girl with it to the boarding-house
where you are staying telling her to
ask in case they said you were out
whether you had left town yesterday
evening after a few minutes the girl
returned with the envelope and said
that you came home last night late and
had left early this morning and now
vou understand why i disbelieve your
other statements

in a slightly sneering tone she said
i am afraid monsieur goron that
through moving so much among crimi-

nals you are apt to see malefactors
everywhere and you are doing me the
honor to rank me among them i

  she looked at me defiantly yet with
an emotion she tried hard to conceal

  i waited a minute or so and then
burst out with the question

  why did you strike that man

  this time lie staggered and bury-
ing her face in her hands she cried
convulsively

  when i saw she had regained her
composure  laid my hand gently on
her shoulder

  mademoiselle brunet i said par-
don me if i have dealt a little roughly
with you but i must and will get at
the bottom of that ailair that man
lying now at the hospital may for all t
know be a miscreant but i cannot al-
low him to be punished for an offense
i feel positive he never intended to i

commit as to you mademoiselle-

  she did not let me finish my sen-
tence

  help me monsieur goron she j
cried promise to help me and i will
tell you all i am no criminal she
added with a piteous smile

  you need not tell me that i
laughed i never for an instant
thought you were

  when i was a little girl she be-
gan in a low voice my mother had a
volume of dantes inferno illustrated
by gustave dore i used to look for
hours at a drawing representing poor
wretches trying to escape from a sea of
burning pitch and always thrust back
by an army of devils i little thought
that this drawing would symbolize my
life  a moment ago i had the courage
to taunt you for living in a world of
crime you who when you return home
breathe a pure atmosphere whilst i
do what i may am constantly thrown
back into my inferno whose sins am i
i expiating not my own i hope for 
i have always striven to act rightly

  it began when i was ten years old 
i had lost my mother and one day my
father was arrested on a charge of em-
bezzlement he died in prison and
my aunt madame maillard befriended
inc i then married my husband was
the rue mo nt era mystery



  handsome intelligent he held a fine
  position and my friends congratulated
  me on my luck you know of course
  what occurred he committed forgery
  it also transpired that he had a liaison
  and i obtained my divorce i adver-
  tised for a situation as shorthand-writer
  and secretary and was engaged by a
  monsieur fenoux i was earning my
  living and began to feel hopeful mon-
  sieur fenoux worked me rather hard
  but he paid me well for my services al-
  though somewhat irregularly one day
  i discovered that he was a cunning ras-
  i cal living at the expense of others
  he wanted me to call on some one at
  the hotel continental and impersonate
  a foreign countess i refused and gave
  up my situation an inexorable fate
  seemed to throw me continually among
  evil-doers

 at monsieur fenouxs i had made
 the acquaintance of a monsieur salles

 a french canadian-

   the man now lying at the depot in-
i firmary i asked

   yes on several occasions he had
   given me tickets for the theater and
  i a friendship had sprung up between
  us when i told him that i had given
  monsieur fenoux notice he said i had
  done the right thing and that he would
  find me another situation he added
  that in the meantime i could do some
  typewriting for him and i gladly ac-

	cepted his offer but before a wreek
had elapsed he began to pay me marked
attention and i decided to break off
further intercourse with him i there-
fore hurried over the work he had
given me and when it was finished
took it down to his office there was
nobody in the little anteroom but
through the closed door of the private
room i heard angry voices followed by
a smothered cry for help i threw open
the door and there stood monsieur
salles grasping a long thin man by
 the throat on perceiving me he re-
 leased his hold but not a word was
spoken the other man pulled himself
i together and walked out of the office
i muttering something i did not under-
stand monsieur salles then turned to
me

   i had to do it he said and but
for your dropping in i would probably
have throttled him

  without replying i handed him the
typewritten copies

   wait a second for me he cried
i want to send off a wire and will re-
turn at once

  whilst he was gone my glance wan-
dered to some letters on the table and
you will understand my dismay when
on one of them i recognized my ex-
husbands writing it was a short note
dated about six months before his ar-
rest it read

  dear salles  i have not yet received the
martinot agreement the moment it comes
to hand i will send it you yours

                            l richard

  for a moment i stood stock-still
the document referred to was among
those i had copied what did it all
mean  what fresh villainy was com-
ing to light i that mans divorced
wife had possibly become an accom-
plice  filled with an indescribable
loathing i gathered up the papers i
had brought including my ex-hus-
bands letter and stuffed them into the
little bag i had brought with me with
the intention of starting that evening
for rouen and made for the door but
before i reached it monsieur salles re-
turned i have no recollection of the
scene that followed nor of what i said
to him all i remember is that he
shouted that unless i returned him
these documents he wras a lost man and
that he finally grasped my arm but
i shook him off ran down the stairs
jumped into a cab and drove to
madame maillards monsieur salles
had followed me as i got out at the
pue montera he again begged me to
let him have the papers but i pushed
him away and entered my aunt s house
in the middle of the night i awoke to
find him concealed beneath my bed

  mad with rage i hit him with the
first thing i could seize curiously
enouqh the thought that possibly i
might have killed him never struck me
otherwise i would have been more
frightened moreover these papers
had taken possession of my mind evi-


the populzr magazine

dcntly they were of great importance
for salles to have risked so much i
a convicts laughter a convicts wife
saw myself sharing their fate inno-
cent i would have to suffer with the
guilty but although well-nigh de-
spairing i resolved to fight against my
cruel destiny and having dressed quick-
ly rushed home to put the papers in
a safe place  returned the next morn-
ing to niv aunts and it was only then
that i began to realize what i had done
vou know the rest and now what
do you want me to do what do you
want to do with me 

   had listened attentively to this ex-
traordinary story and waited a few
minutes for the lady to master her emo-
tion

  you did well to confide in me 
said and i will help you in fact you
need help for you have placed yourself
in a strange predicament you told
everybody that you did not know the
man and that you hit him on the head
because you thought he was a burglar
supposing you had not made these dis-
closures to me one of two things would
have happened either the man-who
apparently had a secret he is afraid to
divulge-having maintained an abso-
lute silence would have been convicted
of attempting a burglary in which case
you would have committed an abom-
inable action in allowing this to be
done or afraid of the consequences
of his act he would have tried to clear
himself by staling why he went to the
house just think how this would have
affected you you would have stood
in the position of one of his confed-
erates-the very thing you were afraid
of have you not thought of all this

  she turned red to the roots of her
hair

  monsieur goron she at last fal-
tered i see how wrong i have been
but nothing of this struck me f have
been and still am under a spell my
mind is giving way under it 

  she put a hand on either side of her
head and rocked herself to anti fro in
the intensity of her grief

  does monsieur salles know you arc
richards divorced wife i asked

  no i am sure he does not he
only knows me by my maiden name

  so much the better but it is ab-
solutely necessary that this affair
should be settled at once and i there-
fore must see this monsieur salles to-
day will you put yourself unreserved-
ly in my hands

  yes monsieur goron but you
cannot fight against this spell

  yes i can

  in less than an hour i arrived at the
infirmary where to my regret i learned
that the examining magistrate had al-
ready taken the matter in hand no
lime was to be lost i found the pseu-
do duval reclining in an easy chair

he was very pale

  good afternoon i said  hope
you are better

  he gave me a quick glance and
looked away i took a chair near him
and resumed

  in a few days you will very likely 
be in the public prosecutors hands
the consequences may then be fatal to j
you for everybody believes you went
to madame maillards house on bur-
glary bent yes everybody-except 
myself i guessed from the very start j
that other motives had prompted you 
to go to that house i now know these 
motives if you have committed some i
other offense for which you may have j
to answer the law must take its course i
but  want to save you from being i
charged with one you never perpe-
trated or intended to perpetrate now
will you speak

  his color rose he breathed heavily il
but he remained silent

  monsieur salles i then cried it j 
is no use your playing hide-and-seek
with me mademoiselle alice brunet 
has told me all m

  he turned quickly toward me with
heaving chest and an intense expression
of pain in his eyes he then suddenly w
held out both his hands

  monsieur goron he muttered in a o
husky voice you can grasp themyj
they are clean

   shook his hand and said	ji

  keep calm if as you say-and i ffl
believe your words-your conscience isjj
the rue montera mystery



clear my task will be easier cut for
heavens sake speak 

  talking rapidly as if anxious to rid
himself of an oppressive load he said 
you know mademoiselle brunets
secret now hear mine it will not
take many words to tell i am from
montreal where my father was in the
export trade his business was thri-
ving and some ten years ago he re-
tired with a comfortable fortune he
bought a pretty villa on the outskirts of
the city and we might have been very
happy but with nothing to occupy
his mind lime weighed heavily on him
and he who used to have a horror of
gambling began to speculate chance
favored him al first then his luck
turned and in order to retrieve his
losses he plunged unfortunately he
kept all his affairs from my mother and
me and we were powerless to interfere
one day he said he had embarked on a
big scheme that would bring in a for-
tune strange men came to the house
with whom he remained closeted but
nothing transpired of these secret meet-
ings some twelve months ago he was
seized with an apopleptic fit and he is
now lying paralyzed i had in the
meantime started business on my own
account and am doing well of course
i came to ray mothers assistance to ex-
tricate her from the position in which
my father had placed her my father
we discovered had lost the greater part
of his fortune but there was still
enough left for both to live in compara-
tive comfort one day we received the
visit of a man called bedford an
american to our horror we learned
that my father had fallen into the
hands of a lot of swindlers and had be-
come seriously compromised two of
these men have been convicted one
who committed forgery is called rich-
ard-

  mademoiselle alice brunets ex-
husband

  salles stared at me open-mouthed
  her husband are you positive
  quite positive

  he remained a moment pensive

    his then explains her extraordi-
nary attitude well this bedford at-

tempted to blackmail us and i foresaw
a catastrophe after infinite trouble i
found out the names of the persons in
london and paris who had been swin-
dled by the gang my poor father hav-
ing unconsciously helped them in their
work and the only way to save us all
from disgrace was to refund the vic-
tims between my mother and myself
we raised the necessary funds and 
at once started for europe  in london
i had no trouble to settle everything
but that scoundrel bedford dogged me
to paris and by every means tried lo
hinder me from arranging matters i
nearly killed him in my office the other
day for all that i hoped i had over-
come the worst difficulties when for
reasons which at the time appeared to
me inexplicable mademoiselle brunet
refused to return me some documents
of the greatest importance i followed
her to her aunts and determined to
recover my papers at any price i stole
into the house and hid mvself there
it was a reckless act for which i suf-
fered had it not been for mademoi-
selle brunet i would probably be now
on my way to montreal it is hard on
me and on my poor mother and this
monsieur goron is the whole story
i could not help stamping my foot
why did you not tell me all this the
first time i saw you instead of allow-
ing such an ugly charge to hang over
your head 

  have you ever had your skull bro-
ken monsieur goron he asked with
a bitter smile if not you do not
know the effect it has on the brain
mine had ceased to work and i was
afraid to speak for fear of placing my-
self in a worse plight heaven knows
how it all will end

  let me have all the documents rela-
tive to the whole business and leave it
all to me i cried

  t found the papers at the address he
gave me and mademoiselle brunet
having at my request handed me those
in her possession i carefully went
through them and satisfied myself that
salles statement to me was true in
every respect i then laid all the facts
before the public proseculor who at


the ppuljr magazine

oncc issued the order for the mans re-
lease a week later salles called at
my office and beaming with joy in-
formed me that his mission was now
successfully terminated

  i am now returning to montreal
he said and shall never forget your
kindness 

  three years elapsed i had been
asked to act as best man to an old
friend and at two oclock in the after-
noon arrived at the mairie of the passv
quarter where the civil marriage was
to take place as  entered the build-
ing  saw a red-haired gentleman with
a big gardenia in his buttonhole at the
door and i recognized salles

  are you a happy bridegroom i
asked laughingly

  yes he replied and there comes
the bride

  a hired brougham drove up and an
elderly lady and gentleman alighted
escorting mademoiselle alice brunet
very gorgeous in violet cloth with a
long train on seeing me she turned
crimson and talcing me aside whis-
pered 

   suppose you are surprised

  no  never am but what about

the spell

  its broken monsieur goron and
 am so happy

  you must have broken that pell
ihe night you broke salles head
hush monsieur goron she called
out placing her little gloved hand on
my lips we never refer to that
salles now came toward us but at
that moment the usher called out their
names and kissing their hands to mt
they ami their friends entered the mar-
riage-hall



the luck of lottery numbers

there is no one-not even a monte carlo gambler-who is more super-
stitious than the man who expects to make a fortune by a turn of the
lottery-wheel he is a firm and unshakable believer in lucky numbers
looks for them all day dreams of them at night and sees in the most trivial
happening the key that is to open for him the treasure-house of fortune

    many dream the lucky number others choose their age or that of a wife
or friend a row of odd or even numbers or numbers drawn haphazard out of a
hat each pinning his or her faith absolutely to the number thus fantastically
chosen

    in europe to-day and especially in italy the craze for lucky numbers is
almost universal a number is dreamed of and immediately the dreamer rushes
to the ticket-office to purchase it a man falls from a scaffolding twenty-three
feet high and the number twenty-three is applied for a woman sees a cat and
dog playing together she rushes home consults her hook of symbols finds the
two animals represented under number sixty-five and that number must be
obtained if it is possible for it is sure to bring hick

a curious hotel

there is a large hotel in colorado which has a notable feature of interest
in the fart that a trout-stream runs right through its dining-room a
guest is allowed to take roil and line and angle for the fish which when
caught are cooked and served to him at he next meal and it is quite a regular
custom for a guest to catch trout for his own breakfast needless to say the
stream is kept well stocked with fish and is a great attraction to the guests

the poepulacr magazine

gesiions balanced in constellations the
blottesque intellectual battle-grounds
over which  have been fighting  find
this account of nn relations to beatrice
quite the most difficult part of my story
to write i happen to he a very ob-
jective-minded person  forget my
moods and this was so much an altair
of moods and even such moods and
emotions as  recall are very difficult to
convey to me it is about as difficult
as describing a taste or a scent

  then the objective story is made up
of little things that are difficult to set in
a proper order and love is an hys-
terical passion now high now low
now exalted ami now intensely physical
no one has ever yet dared to tell a love-
story completely its alternations its
comings anti goings its debased mo-
ments its hate the love-stories we
tell tell only the net consequence the
ruling effect

  how can i rescue from the past now
the mystical quality of beatrice my
intense longing for her the overwhelm-
ing irrational formless desire how
can i explain how intimately that wor-
ship mingled with a high impatient re-
solve to make her mine to take her by
strength and courage to do my loving
in a violent heroic manner and then
the doubts the puzzled arrest at the
fact of her fluctuation at her refusal
to marry me at the fact that even when
at last she returned to bedley corner
she seemed to evade me she returned
to bedley corner and for some weeks
se was flitting about me and never
once could i have talk with her alone
when she came to my sheds carpabv
was always with her jealously observ-
ant why the devil couldnt she send
him about his business the days
slipped by and my anger gathered

  all this mingles with the making of
lord robots b i had resolved upon
that one night as  lay awake at
bedley corner i got it planned out
before the bandages were off my
face i conceived this second navigable
balloon in a grandiose manner it was
lo be a second lord roberts a only
more so it was to be three times as big
large enough to carry three men and

c an altogether triumphant

vindication of my claims upon the air
the framework was to be hollow like
a birds bones air-tight and the air
pumped in or out as the weight of fuel
i carried changed i talked much and
boasted to cothope-whom  suspected
of skepticisms about this new type-
of what it would do and it progressed
-slowly at times  would ro away
to london to snatch some chance of
seeing beatrice there at times nothing
but a day of gliding and hard and dan-
gerous exercise would satisfy me and
now in the newspapers in conversation
in everything about me arose a new
invader of my mental slates some-
thing was happening to the great
schemes of my uncle s affairs people
were beginning to doubt to question
it was the first quiver ci his tremendous
insecurity the first wobble of that gi-
gantic credit top he ha  kept spinning
so long

   there were comings and goings no-
vember and december slipped by i
had two unsatisfactory meetings with
beatrice meetings that had no privacy
-in which we said things of the sort
lhat need atmosphere badly and fur-
tively  wrote to her several times and
she wrote back notes that  would
sometimes respond to altogether some-
times condemn as insincere evasions
you dont understand i cant just
now explain be patient with me
leave things a little while to me so
she wrote to me

   i would talk aloud to these notes and
wrangle over them in my workroom-
while the plans of lord roberts b
waited

  you dont give me a chance i
would say why dont you let me
know the secret thats what m for
-to settle difficulties r

   and at last  could hold out no longer
against these accumulating pressures

    took an arrogant outrageous line
that left her no loopholes i behaved
as though we were living in a melo-
drama	

  you must come and talk to me 
wrote or i will come and take you
i want you-and the time runs away
to no- unga y



    we met in a ride in the upper plan-
  tations it must have been early in
  january for there was snow on the
  ground and on the brandies of the
  trees we walked to and fro for an
  hour or more and from the first i
  pitched the key high in romance and
  made understandings impossible it
  was our worst time together i boasted
  itkeran actor and she i know not why
  was tired and spiritless

    what are the difficulties  i cried
  theres no difficulty i will not over-
  come for you do your people think
  im no equal for you who says it
  my dear tell me to win a title ill do
  it in five years

    here am i just grown a man at the
  sight of yon i have wanted some-
  thing to fight for let me fight for
  you

    im rich without intending it let
  me mean it give me an honorable ex-
  cuse for it and ill put all this rotten
  old warren of england at your feet

    i said such things as that i write
  them down here in all their resounding
  base pride i said these empty and
  foolish things and they are part of me
  why should i still cling to pride and
   be ashamed i shouted her down

    i passed from such megalomania to
i petty accusations

    you think carnaby is a better man
 than i i said

    no she cried stung to speech

	no

you think were unsubstantial
youve listened to all these rumors
boom has started because we talked of a
i newspaper of our own when you are
with me you know im a man  when
i you get away from me you think im
a cheat and a cad theres not a word
 of truth in the things they say about
us ive been slack ive left things

j but we have only to exert ourselves
iiyou do not know how wide and far we
have spread our nets even now we
have a coup-an expedition-in hand
i it will put us on a footing

i-v	eres asked mutely and asked in

vain that i would cease to boast of the
  very qualities she admired in me

  in the night i could not sleep for
thinking of that talk and the vulgar
things  had said in it i could not
understand the drift my mind had
taken  was acutely disgusted and
my unwonted doubts about myself
spread from a merely personal discon-
tent to our financial position it was
all very well to talk as i had done of
wealth and power and peerage hut
what did i know nowadays of my un-
cles position suppose in the midst
of such boasting and confidence there
came some turn i did not suspect some
rottenness he had concealed from me
i resolved  had been playing with
aeronautics long enough that next
morning i would go to him and have
things clear between us

  i caught an early train and went up
to the hardingham

 i went up to the hardingham
through a dense london fog to see
how things really stood before i had
talked to mv uncle for ten minutes i
felt like a man who has just awakened
in a bleak inhospitable room out of a
grandiose dream

chapter ix

ijow r stole the iieats of quap from
mordet island

  we got to make a fight for it said
my uncle we got to face the music 

  i remember that even at the sight of
him i had a sense of impending calam-
ity he sat under the electric light
with the shadow of his hair making
bars down his face he looked shrunk-
en and sallow as though his skin had
suddenly got loose and yellow the
decorations of the room seemed to
have lost freshness and outside-the
blinds were up-there was not so much
fog as a dun darkness one saw the
dingy outlines of the chimneys oppo-
site quite distinctly and then a sky of
th a brown as only london can dis-
play

  i saw a placard i said more
ponderevity 

  thats boom he said boom and
his damned newspapers hes trying


the popular magazine

to fight me clown ever since i of-
fered to buy the daily decorator hes
been at me and lie thinks consolida-
ting do lt cut down the ads lie wants
everything damn him lies got no
sense of dealing id like to bash his
face

  well  said whats to be done
  keep going said my uncle

  ill smash boom yet he said with
sudden savagery

  nothing else  asked

  we got to keep going theres a
scare on did you notice the rooms
half the people out there this morning
are reporters and if  talk they touch
it up they didnt used to touch things
up now they put in character
touches-insulting you dont know
what journalisms coming to its all
booms doing

  he cursed lord boom with consid-
erable imaginative vigor

w ell i said what can he do
shove us up against time george
make money tight for us we been
handling a lot of money-and he
tightens us up

  were sound

  oh were sound george trust
me for that but all the same-theres
such a lot of imagination in these
things were sound enough thats
not it

  he blew damn boom he said
and his eyes over his glasses met mine
defiantly

  we cant  suppose run close-
hauled for a bit-stop expenditure
where

  well-crest hill

  what he shouted me stop
crest hill for boom  he waved a
fist as if to hit his inkpot and con-
trolled himself with difficulty he
spoke at last in a reasonable voice
if i did fie said hed kick up a
fuss its no good even if  ward
to everybodys watching the pltftt
if i was to stop building wed be down
in a week

  he had an idea i wish i could do
something to start a strike or some-
thing no such luck treat those

workmen a sight too well no sink or
swim crest hill goes on until were
under water

  i began to ask questions and irri-
tated him instantly

  < >h dash these explanations
george he cried you only make
tilings look rottener than they are its
your way it isnt a case of figures
were all right-theres only one thing
we got to do

  yes

  show value george thats where
this quap comes in thats why i fell
in so readily with what you brought to
me week before last here we are we
got our option on the perfcct filament
and all we wants canadium nobody
knows theres more canadium in the
world than will go on the edge of a six-
pence except me and you nobody has
an idee the perfect filaments more than
just a bit of theorizing fifty tons of
quap and wed turn that bit of the-
orizing into somethin-wed make the
lamp trade sit on its tail and howl
wed put ediswan and all of em into
a parcel with our last years trousers 
and a hat and swap em off for a pot
of geraniums see wed do it
through business organizations and
there you are see caperns patent
filament the ideal and the real
george well do it well bring it off j
and then well give such a facer to
boom hell think for fifty years hes
laving up for our london and african
meeting let him he can turn the
whole paper onto us he says the
business organizations shares arent
worth fifty-two and we quote em at
eighty-four well here we are get-
tin ready for him-loading our gun
his pose was triumphant

   yes i said thats all right but
 cant help thinking where should we 
be if we hadnt just by accident got 
caperns perfect filament because
you know it was an accident-my buy-
ing up like that

  he crumpled up his nose into an ex-
pression of impatient distaste at my un-
reasonableness	   t

   and after all the meetings in june j
and you havent begun to get the quap j
tono-bunga y



  after all weve still got to load our

 gtn-

    they start on toosday

    have they got the brig

    theyve got a brig
    gordon-nasim th j i doubted

    safe as a bank be said more i
 sec of that man the more  like him
 all i wish is wed got a steamer in-
 stead of a sailing ship-

   and i went on you seem to
 overlook what used to weigh with us a
 bit this canadium side of the busi-
 ness and the capern chance have
 rushed you off your legs after all-
 its stealing and in its way an inter-
 national outrage theyve got two gun-
 boats ou the coast

    i jumped up and went and stared out
 at the fog

    and by jove its about our only
 chance  i didnt dream

    i turned on him ive been up in
 the air i said heaven knows where
 i havent been and heres our only
 chance-and you give it to lhat adven-
 turous lunatic to play in his own way
 -in a brig

 well you had a voice-

  wish id been in this before we
 ought to have run out a steamer to
 lagos or one of those west coast
 places and done it from there fancy
 a brig in the channel at ibis time of
 year if it blows southwest

 i dare say youd have shoved it
 george still-you know george i
 believe in him

 yes i said yes t believe in

 him too in a way still-

 he took up a telegram that was lying
 on his desk and opened it his face
 became a livid yellow he put the
 flimsy pink paper down with a slow
 reluctant movement and took oft his
 glasses

  george he said the lucks against
  us 

 what

 he grimaced with his mouth in the
 queerest wav at the telegram

 that

  i took it up and read

  m- tor smash compound fracture of the leg
  gordon nasjnyth what price mordct now

    

   for a moment neither of us spoke
   thats all right i said at last

   eh  said my uncle

   im going ill get that quap or
bust



    i had a ridiculous persuasion that i
 was saving the situation

    i m going i said quite consciously
 and dramatically i saw the whole af-
 fair-how shall i put it t-in american
 colors

   i sat down beside him give me all
the data youve got i said and ill
pull this thing off

   but nobody knows exactlv where
it-

    nasmyth does and hell tell me

   hes been very close said my un-
cle and regarded me

   hell tell me all right now hes
smashed

   he thought i believe he will

   george he said if you pull this
thing off  once or twice before youve
stepped in-with that sort of woosh of
yours-

    fie left the sentence unfinished

   give me that note-book i said
and tell me all you know wheres
the ship wheres pollack and
wheres that telegram from if that
quaps to be got ill get it or bust if
youll hold on here until  get back
with it

   and so it was i jumped into the
wildest adventure of my life

   i requisitioned my uncles best car
forthwith i went down that night to
the place of despatch named on nas-
myths telegram bampton routed him
out with a little trouble from that cen-
ter made things right with him and got
his explicit directions and i was in-
specting the maud mary with young
pollack his cousin and aide the follow-
ing afternoon she was rather a shock
to me and not at all in my style a beast
of a brig inured to the potato trade
and she reeked from end to end with
the faint subtle smell of raw potatoes
so that it prevailed even over the tem-
porary smell of new paint


the popular magazine

  sa was a beast of a brig all hold
ami dirty framework and they had bal-
lasted her with old iron and old rails
and iron sleepers and gut a miscella-
neous lot of spades and iron wheel-
barrows against the loading of the
quap  thought her pver with pol-
lack one of those tall blond young
men who smoke pipes and dont help
much and then by myself and as a
result i did my bet to sweep graves-
end clean of uheeling-planks and got
in a- much cord and small rope as 
could for lashing  had an idea we
might need to run up a jetty in addi-
tion to much ballast she held remotely
hidden in a sort of inadvertent way a
certain number of ambiguous cases
which i didnt examine but which i
gathered were a provision against the
need of a trade

  the captain was a most extraordi-
nary creature under the impression we
were after copper ore he was a rou-
manian jew with twitching excitable
features w ho had made his way to a
certificate after some preliminary naval
experiences in the black sea the mate
was an essex man of impenetrable re-
serve the crew were astoundingly ill
clad and destitute and dirty most of
them youths unwashed out of colliers
one the cook was a mulatto and one
the best-built fellow of them all was a
breton there was some subterfuge
about our position on board-i forget
the particulars now-i was called the
supercargo and pollack was the stew-
ard this added to the piratical flavor
that insufficient funds and gordon-
nasmyths original genius had already
given the enterprise

  those two days of bustle at graves-
end under dingy skies in narrow dirty
streets were a new experience for me
it i like nothing else in my life i
realized that i was a modern and a
civilized man i found the food filthy
and the coffee horrible the whole town
stank in my nostrils the landlord of
the good intent on the quay had a
stand-up quarrel with us before  could
get even a hot bath and the bedroom
i slept in was infested by a quantity
of exotic but voracious hat parasites

called locally bugs in the walls in
the woodwork everywhere  fought
them with insect-powder and found
them comatose in the morning

  let me confess that through all this
time before we started  was immensely
self-conscious and that heat rice played
the part of audience in my imagination
throughout i was as  say saving
the situation and  was acutely aware 
of that the evening before we sailed
instead of revising our medicine-chest
as i had intended i look the car and
ran across country to lady grove to
tell my aunt of the journey i was ma-
king dress and astonish lady osprey
by an after-dinner call

  the two ladies were at home and
alone beside a big fire that seemed won-
derfully cheerful after the winter night j
i remember the effect of the little par-
lor in which they sat as very bright and 
domestic lady osprey in a costume 
of mauve and lace sat on a chintz sofa
and played an elaborately spread-out
patience by the light of a tall shaded
lamp beatrice in a white dress that j
showed her throat smoked a cigarette in j
an armchair and read with a lamp at her 
elbow the room was white-paneled 
and chintz-curtained about these two 
bright centers of light were warm dark 
shadows in which a circular mirror
shone like a pool of brown water i
carried oil my raid by behaving like a
slave of etiquette there were mo-
ments when i think i really made lady
osprey believe that my call was an i
unavoidable necessity that it would
have been negligent of me not to call i
just how and when i did but at the 
best those were transitory moments i

  they received me with disciplined i
amazement lady osprey was inter- i
ested in my face and scrutinized the i
scar beatrice stood behind her solid- j
tude our eyes met and in hers i 
could see startled interrogations

  im going i said to the west j
coast of africa		i

  they asked questions but it suited j
my mood to be vague

  weve interests there it is urgent
i should go i dont know when i may
return
tono-bungay



  after that i perceived beatrice sur-
veyed me steadily

  the conversation was rather difficult
i embarked upon lengthy thanks for
their kindness lo me after my accident
i tried to understand lad ospreys
game of patience but it didnt appear
that lady osprey was anxious for me
to understand her patience i came to
the verge of taking my leave

  you neednt go yet said beatrice
abruptly

  she walked across to the piano took
a pile of music from the cabinet near
surveyed lady ospreys back and with
a gesture to me dropped it all delib-
erately onto the floor

  must talk she said kneeling close
to me as i helped her to pick it up
turn my pages at the piano

  i cant read music

  turn my pages

  presently we were at the piano and
beatrice was playing with noisy inac-
curacy she glanced over her shoulder
and lady osprey had resumed her pa-
tience the old lady was very pink
and appeared to be absorbed in some
attempt to cheat herself without our
observing

  isnt west africa a vile climate 
are you going to live there why are
you going 

  beatrice asked these questions in a
low voice and gave me no chance to
answer then taking a rhythm from
the music before her she said 

  at the back of the house is a gar-
den-a door in the wall-on the lane
understand 

  i turned over two pages without any
effect on her playing

  when i asked

  she dealt in chords i wish i could
play this  she said midnight

  she gave her attention to the music
for a time

  you may have to wait

  ill wait

  she brought her playing to an end by
-as schoolboys say-stashing it up
i cant plav to-night she said
standing up and meeting my eyes i
wanted to give vou a parting volun-
tary

  was that wagner beatrice asked
lady osprey looking up from her
cards it sounded very confused

  i took my leave i had a curious
twinge of conscience as i parted from
lady osprey either a first intimation
of middle age or my inexperience in
romantic affairs was to blame but i
felt a very distinct objection to the
prospect of invading this good ladys
premises from the garden door i mo-
tored up to the pavilion found cothope
reading in bed told him for the first
time of west africa spent an hour
with him in settling all the outstanding
details of lord roberts b and left that
in his hands to finish against my return
i sent the motor back to lady grove
and still wearing my fur coat-for the
january night was damp and bitterly
cold-walked back to bedley corner

  i found the lane to the back of the
dower house without any difficulty
and was at the door in the wall with
ten minutes to spare i lit a cigar and
fell to walking up and down this
queer flavor of intrigue this nocturnal
garden-door business had taken me by
surprise and changed my mental atti-
tudes i was startled out of my ego-
tistical pose and thinking intently of
beatrice of that elfin quality in her
that always pleased me that always took
me by surprise that had made her for
example so instantly conceive this
meeting

  she came within a minute of mid-
night  the door opened softly and she
appeared a short gray figure in a
motor-coat of sheepskin bareheaded to
the cold drizzle she flitted up to me
and her eyes were shadows in her
dusky face

 why are you going to west
africa  she asked at once

  business crisis i have to go

 youre not going- youre com-
ing back 

  three or four months i said at
most

  then its nothing to do with me

  nothing i said why should it
have 

  oh thats all right one never
knows what people think or what peo-


ihe povular magazine

pie fane  she iook me by the arm
lets go toi  walk she said

  i looked about me at darkness and
rain

  thats all right she laughed we
can go along the lane and into the old
w oking road do you mind r of
course you dont ivlv nead   doesnt

matter one never meets anybody
  how do you know 

  ive wandered like this before of
course did you think-she nodded
her head back at her home-thats
ill 

  no by jove i cried its mani-
fest it isnt

  she took my arm and turned me
down the lane nights my time she
-aid b my side theres a touch of
the werwolf in my blood one never
knows in these old families ive won-
dered often here we are anyhow
alone in the world just darkness and
cold and a sky of clouds and wet and
we-together i like the wet on my
face and hair dont you when do
you sail 

  i told her to-morrow

  oh well theres no to-morrow now
you and i she stopped and con-
fronted me

  you dont say a word except to
answer

  no i said

  last time you did all the talking

  like a fool now-

  we looked at each others dim face
youre glad to be here 

  im glad-im beginning to be-its
tr chan glad

  she put her hands on my shoulders
nd drew me down to kiss her

  ah she said and for a moment or
  we just citing to one another

  thats all she said releasing her-
self what bundles of clothes we are
to- mght i felt we should kiss some
day again always the last time
was ages ago

  among the fern-stalks

  among the bracken you remem-
ber and your lips were cold were
mine the same lips-after so long-
after so much i and now lets trudge
through this blotted-out world together

for a time yes let inc take your
arm just trudge see hold tight
to me because i know the way-
and dont talk-dont talk unless
you want to talk let me tell you
things you sec dear the whole
vorld is blotted out-its dead and
gone and were in this place this
-rk wild place were dead or all
e world is dead no were -lead
no one can see us were shadows
weve got out of our positions out of
our bodies-and together thats the
good thing of it-together thats the
why the world cant see us and why we
hardly see ihe world ssh is it all
right

  its all right i said

  we stumbled along for a time in a
close silence we passed a dim-lit rain-
veiled window

  the silly world she said the silly
world if eats and sleeps if tin- wet
didnt patter so from the trees wed
hear it snoring its dreaming such
tupid things-stupid judgments it
doesnt know we are passing we two-
free of it-clear of it yon and i

  we pressed against each other reas-
suringly

  im glad were dead she whis-
pered tin glad were dead i was
tired of it dear  was so tired of it
dear and so entangled

  she stopped abruptly

  we splashed through a string of pud-
dles i began to remember things i
had meant to say

  lcok here i cried i want to
help yoi beyond measure you are en-
tangled what is t e trouble i asked
you to marry me au said you would
but theres somethg

  my thoughts s unded clumsy as t
said them

  is it somethin bout my position
or is it something perhaps-about
some other man 

  there was an immense assenting si-
lence

  youve puzzled me so at first-i
mean quite early-i thought you meant
to make me marry you

  i did

 and then-
tono-bungay



  to-night she said after a lonf
pause i cant explain i love you
i-lit-explanations to-night-my dear
here we are in the world alone-
aud the world doesnt matter nothing
matters here am i in the cold with
you-and my bed away there deserted
id tell you-i will tell you when things
enable me to tell you and soon enough
they will but to-night- wont i
wont

  he left my side and went in front
of me

  she turned upon me look here
she said i insist upon your being dead
do you understand im not joking
to-night you and i are out of life its
our time together there may be other
times but this we wont spoil were
-in hades if you like where theres
nothing to hide and nothing to tell
no bodies even no bothers we
loved each other-down there-and
were kept apart but now it doesnt
matter its over if - wont agree

lo	that-i will go home

  i wanted- i began

  i know oh my dear ifyoud
only understand i understand if youd
only not care-and love me to-night
i do love you i said

  then love me she answered and
leave all these things that bother you
love me  here i am 

 but-

  no she said

  well have your way

  she carried her point and we wan-
dered into the quiet together and bea-
trice talked to me of love

  id never heard a woman before in
all my life who could talk of love who
could lay bare and develop and touch
with imagination all that mass of fine
emotion every woman it may be hides
she had read of love she had thought
of love a thousand sweet lyrics had
sounded through her brain and left tine
fragments in her memory  she poured it
out all of it shamelessly skilfully for
me i cannot give any sense of that
talk i cannot even tell how much of
the delight of it was the magic of her
voice the glow of her near presence
and always we walked swathed warm-

ly through a chilly air along dim in-
terminable greasy roads-with never a
soul abroad it seemed but s never a
beast in the fields

  why do people love each other  i
said

  why not

  but why do i love you why is
your voice better than any voice your
face sweeter than any face 

  and why do i love you she asked 
not only what is fine in you but what
isnt why do i love your dulness
your arrogance for i do to-night
i love the very rain-drops on the fur of
your coat

  so we talked and at last very wet
still glowing but a little tired we parted
at the garden door we had been
wandering for two hours in our strange
irrational community of happiness and
all the world about us and particularly
lady osprey and her household had
been asleep-and dreaming of anything
rather than beatrice in the night and
rain

  she stood in the doorway a muffled
figure with eyes that glowed

  come back she whispered i shall
wait for you

  she hesitated

  she touched the lapel of my coat i
love you  she said and lifted her
face to mine

  i held her to me and was atromble
from top to toe o god i cried
and i must go 

  she slipped from my arms and
paused regarding me for an instant
the world seemed full of fantastic pos-
sibilities

  yes go she said and vanished and
slammed the door upon me leaving me
alone like a man now fallen from fairy-
land in the black darkness of the night

-

  that expedition to mordet island
stands apart from all the rest of mv
life detached a piece by itself with an
atmosphere of its own

  vile weather an impatient fretting
against unbearable slowness and delay


the popular magazine

seasickness general discomfort and hu-
miliating self-revelation are the master-

values of these memories

  i was sick all through the journey
out i dont know why it was the
only time i was ever seasick and i
have seen some pretty had weather
since  became a boat-builder but that
phantom smell of potatoes was pecul-
iar vile to me  coining back on the
brig we were all ill every one of us so
soon as we got lo sea poisoned i firmly
believe by quap on the way out most
of the others recovered in a few days
but the stuffiness below the coarse food
the cramped dirty accommodation kept
me if not actually seasick in a slate of
acute physical wretchedness the whole
time the ship abounded in cockroaches
and more intimate vermin i was cold
all the time until after we passed cape
verde then i became steamily hot i
had been too preoccupied with beatrice
and my keen desire to get the maud
mary under way at once to consider
a proper wardrobe for myself and in
particular i lacked a coat heavens
how i lacked that coat and more-
over i was cooped up with two of the
worst bores in christendom pollack
and the captain

  pollack after conducting his illness
in a style better adapted to the capacity
of an opera-house than a small com-
partment suddenly got insupportably
well and breezy and produced a manly
pipe in which he smoked a tobacco as
blond as himself and divided his time
almost equally between smoking it and
trying to clean it

  theres only three things you can
clean a pipe with lie used lo remark
with a twist of paper in hand the
bests a feather the seconds a straw
and the thirds a girls hairpin t never
see such a ship you cant find any
of em last time i came this way i
did find hairpins anyway and found
em on the floor of the captains cabin
regular deposit eh feelin better

  at which i usually swore

  oh youll beall right soon dont
mind my puffin a bit eh

he never tired of asking me to have
a hand at nap good game makes

you forget it and thats half the bat-
tle

  me would sit swaying with the roll-
ing of the ship and suck at his pipe of
blond tobacco and look with an ex-
pressibly sage but somnolent blue eye at
the captain by the hour together cap-
tains a card he would say over and
over again as the outcome of these
meditations iled like to know what
were up to hed like to know-no
end

  that did seem to be the captains
ruling idea but he also wanted to
impress me with the notion that he was
a gentleman of good family and to air
a number of views adverse to the eng-
lish literature to the english constitu-
tion and the like lie had learned the
sea in the roumanian navy and eng-
lish out ot a book he would still at
times pronounce the es at the end of
there and here he was a natural-
ized englishman and he drove me into
a reluctant and uncongenial patriotism
by his everlasting carping at things
english pollack would set himself to
draw him out heaven alone can tell
how near i came to murder

  fifty-three days i had outward
cooped up with these two and a shy
and profoundly depressed mate who
read the bible on sunlays and spent
the rest of his leisure in lethargy three
and fifty days of life cooped up in a
perpetual smell in a persistent sick hun-
ger that turned from the sight of food
in darkness cold and wet in a lightly
ballasted ship that rolled and pitched
and swayed and all the time the
sands in the hour-glass of my uncles
fortunes were streaming out misery
amidst it all i remember only one thing
brightly one morning of sunshine in
the bay of biscay and a vision of froth-
ing waves sapphire-green a bird fol-
lowing in our wake and our masts roll-
ing about the sky i hen wind and rain
close in on us again

  von must not imagine they were
ordinary days days i mean of an aver-
age length  they were not so much days
as long damp slabs of time that
stretched each one to the horizon and
much of that length was night one
tono-bungay



paraded the staggering- deck in a bor-
rowed souwester hour after hour in the
chilly windy splashing and spitting
darkness or sat in the cabin bored and
ill arid looked at the faces of those in-
separable companions by the help of a
lamp that gave smell rather than light
then one would see going up up up
and then sinking down down down
pollack extinct pipe in mouth humor-
ously observing bringing his mind
slowly to the seventy-seventh decision
that the captain was a card while the
words flowed from the latter in a nim-
ble incessant flood dis england eet
is not a country aristocratic no eet
is a glorified bourgeoisie eet is plu-
tocratic in england dere is no aristoc-
racy since de wars of roses in the
rest of europe east of the latins es
in england no

  eet is all middle class youra eng-
land everything you look at middle
class respectable everything good
-eet is you say shocking madame
grundy  eet is all limited and com-
puting and self-seeking dat is why
your art is so limited youra fiction
youra philosophia why you are all so
inartistic you want nothing but profit
what vyill pay what would you

  he had all those violent adjuncts to
speech we western europeans have
abandoned shruggings of the shoulders
waving of the arms thrusting out of the
face wonderful grimaces and twid-
dlings of the hands under your nose
until you wanted to hit them away
day after day it went on and i had
to keep my anger to myself to reserve
myself for the time ahead when it
would be necessary to see the quap was
got aboard and stowed-knee-deep in
this mans astonishment i knew he
would make a thousand objections to
all we had before us he talked like
a drugged man it ran glibly over his
tongue and all the time one could
see his seamanship fretting him he was
gnawed by responsibility perpetually
uneasy about the ships position per-
petually imagining dangers if a sea
hit us exceptionally hard hed be out of
the cabin in an instant making an out-
cry of inquiries and he was pursued

by a dread of the hold of ballast shift-
ing of insidious wicked leaks as we
drew near the african coast his fear
of rocks and shoals became infectious

  ido not know dis coast lie used
to say  cama hera because gordon-
nasmyth was coming too den he docs
not come

  fortunes of war i said arid tried
to think in vain if any motive but -beer
haphazard could have guided gordon-
nasmytb in the choice of ihee two
men i think perhaps gordon-nas-
myth had the artistic temperament and
wanted contrasts and also that the cap-
tain helped him to express his own ma-
lignant anti-britishism he was indeed
an exceptionally inefficient captain on
the whole i was glad i had come even
at the eleventh hour to see to things

  the captain hy the by did at last
out of sheer nervousness get aground
at the end of mordets island but we
got oft in an hour or so with a swell
and a little hard work in the boat

  i suspected the mate of hi opinion
of the captain long before lie expressed
it he was i say a taciturn man b it
one day speech broke through him he
had been sitting at the table with his
arms folded on it musing drearily pipe
in mouth and the voice of the captain
drifted down from above

  the mate lifted his heavy eyes to ine
and regarded me for a moment then
lie began to heave with the beginnings
of speech he disembarrass  himself
of his pipe i cowered with expecta-
tion speech was coming at last re-
fore he spoke he nodded reassuringly
once or twice

  he moved his head strangely
mysteriously but a child miht
known he spoke of the captain

   es a foreigner

  he regarded me doubtfully for a
time and at last decided for the sake
of lucidity to clench the matter

  thats what e is-a dago

  he nodded like a man who gives a
last tap to a nail and i could see he
considered his remark well and truly
laid his face though still resolute
became as tranquil and uneventful as

and

have


the popular magazine

a huge hall after a public meeting has
dispersed out of it and finally be closed
and locked it with his pipe

    roumanian jew isnt he i said

  he nodded darkly and almost forbid-
dingly

  more would have been too much
the thin- was said but from that
time forth i knew i could depend upon
him and that he and  were friends
it happens  ver did have to depend
upon him but that does not affect our
relationship

  forwatd the crew lived lives very
much after the fashion of ours more
crowded more cramped and dirty wet-
ter steamier more verminous the
coarse food they had was still not so
coarse but that they did not think they
were living like fighting-cocks so
far as i could make out they were all
nearly destitute men hardly any of
them had a proper sea-outfit and what
small possessions they bad were a
source of mutual distrust and as we
pitched and floundered southward they
gambled and fought were brutal to one
another argued and wrangled loudly
until we protested at the uproar

  theres no romance about the sea in
a -mall sailing ship as i saw it the
romance is in the mind of the landsman
dreamer those brigs and schooners
and brigantines that still stand out from
every little port are relics from an age
of petty trade as rotten and obsolescent
as a georgian house that has sunken
into a slum they are indeed just float-
ing fragments of slum much as ice-
bergs are floating fragments of glacier
the civilized man who has learned to
wash who has developed a sense of
physical honor of cleanly temperate
feeding of time can endure them no
more they pass ami the clanking coal-
wasting steamers will follow them giv-
ing place to cleaner finer things

  but so it was i made my voyage to
africa and came at last into a world of
steamy fogs and a hot smell of vegeta-
ble decay and into sound and sight of
surf and distant intermittent glimpses
of the coast i lived a strange concen-
trated life through all that time such a
life as a creature must do that has

fallen in a well all my former ways
ceased all my old vistas became mem-
ories

    h situaticn i was saving vva- very
small and distant now   felt its urgency
no more beatrice and lady tirove
my uncle and the hardingham mv
soaring in the ait and my habitua wide
vision of s ift effectual things became
as remote as if they were in some world
i had left forever



  all these african memories qv  b
themselves it was for me an di-
tion into the realms of undisr piird
nature out of the world that i- rt led by
men my first bout with that hot side
of our mother that gives you the jungle
-that cold side that gives you the air-
eddv  was beginning to know passing
well they are memories woven upon
a fabric of sunshine and heat and a
constant warm smell of decay they
end in rain-such rain as i had never
seen before a vehement a frantic
downpouring of water but our first
slow passage through the channels be-
hind mordets island was in incan-
descent sunshine

  there we go in my memory still a
blistered dirty ship with patched sails
and a battered mermaid to present
maud mary sounding and taking
thought between high banks of forest
whose trees come out knee-deep at last
in the water there we go with a lit-
tle breeze on our quarter mordet is-
land rounded and the quap it might be
within a day of us

  here and there strange blossoms
woke the dank intensities of green with
a trumpetrcall of color things crept
among the jungle and peeped and
dashed back rusiiing into stillness al-
ways in the sluggishly drifting opaque
water were eddyings and stirrings lit-
tle rushes of bubbles came chuckling up
light-heartedly from this or that sub-
merged conflict and tragedy now and
again were crocodiles like a stranded
fleet of logs basking in the sun still
it was by day a dreary stillness broken
only by insect sounds and the creaking
tonobungay



 and flapping of our progress by the
 calling of the soundings and the cap-
 tains confused shouts but in the night
 a we lay moored to a cltunp of trees
 the darkness brought a thousand
 -wampy things to life and out of the
 forest came screamings and bowlings
 sc ream ins and yells that made us glad
 o be afloat and once we saw be-
 -n the tree-stems long blazing fires

 	yve passed two or three villages land-
 ward and brown-black women and chil-
 dren came and stared at us and gestic-
 ulated and once a man came out in a
 boat from a creek and hailed us in an
 unknown tongue and so at last we
  came to a great open place a broad
  lake rimmed with a desolation of mud
 and bleached refuse and dead trees free
 from crocodiles or water-birds or sight
 or sound of any living thing and saw
 far off even as nasmyth had described
 the ruins of the deserted station and
 bard by two little heaps of buff-hued
 rubbish under a great rib of rock the
 quap the forest receded the land
 to the right of us fell away and became
 barren and far off across a notch in its
 backbone were surf and the sea

  w e took the ship in toward those
 heaps and the ruined jetty slowly and
 carefully the captain came and
 talked

   this is eet he said

   yes said i

  is eet for trade we have come

   this was ironical

   no said i

  gordon-nasmyth would haf told me
 long ago what it ees for we haf come

  til tell you now i said we are
 going to lay in as close as we can to
 those two heaps of stuff-you see them 
 -under the rock then we are going
 to chuck all our ballast overboard and
 take those in then were going
 home

  may i presume to ask-is eet gold

   no i said incivilly it isnt

  then what is it

  its stuff-of some commercial
value

    ye cant do eet he said

wc can i answered reassuringly
we cant lie said as confidently

i dont mean what you mean you
know so liddle-but -dis is forbidden
country

  i turned on him suddenly angry and
met bright excited eyes for a minute
we scrutinized one another then i
said thats our risk trade is for-
bidden but this isnt trade this
things got to be done

  his eyes glittered and he shook his
head

   the brig stood in slowly through the
twilight toward this strange scorched
and blistered stretch of beach and the
man at the wheel strained his ears to
listen to the low-voiced angry argument
that began between myself and the cap-
tain that was presently joined by pol-
lack we moored at last within a hun-
dred yards of our goal and all through
our dinner and far into the night we
argued intermittently and fiercely with
the captain about our right to load just
what we pleased i will haf nothing
to do with it he persisted i wash
my hands it seemed that night as
though we argued in vain if it is
not trade he said it is prospecting
and mining that is worse any one
who knows anything-outside england
-knows that is worse

  we argued and i lost my temper and
swore at him pollack kept cooler and
chewed his pipe watchfully with that
blue eye of his upon the captains ges-
tures finally i went on deck to cool
the sky was overcast i discovered all
the men were in a knot forward staring
at the faint quivering luminosity that
had spread over the heaps of quap a
phosphorescence such as one sees at
times on rotting wood and about the
beach east and west there were patches
and streaks of something like diluted
sunshine

  in the small hours i was still awake
and turning over scheme after scheme
in my mind whereby i might circum-
vent the captains opposition i meant
to get that quap aboard if i had to kill
some one to do it never in my life
had i been so thwarted  after this in-
tolerable voyage  there came a rap at
my cabin door and then t opened and
i made out a bearded face


the popular magazine

  come in i said and a black volu-
ble figure i could just see obscurely
came in to talk in my private ear and
fill ray cabin with its whisperings and
gestures h was the captain lie too
had been awake and thinking things
over he had come to explain enor-
mously i lay there hating him ami
wondering if  ami pollack could lock
him in his cabin and run the ship with-
out him

  i do not want to spoil dis expedi-
tion emerged from a cloud of protes-
tations and then  was able to disen-
tangle a commission-shush a small
commission-for special risks spe-
cial risks became frequent i let him
explain himself out it appeared he
was also demanding an apology for
omething i had said no doubt i had
insulted liiin generously at last it came
to definite offers i broke my silence
and bargained

  pollack  i cried and hammered the
partition

  whats up asked pollack

  i stated the case concisely

  there came a silence

  hes a card said pollack lets
give him his commission i dont
mind

  eh  i cried

  i said lie was a card thats all said
pollack tm coming

  he appeared in my doorway a faint
white figure and joined our vehement
whisperings

  we had to buy the captain off we
had to promise him ten per cent of
our problematical profits we were to
give him ten per cent on what we sold
the cargo for over and above his legit-
imate pay and i found in my out-
bargained and disordered state small
conolation in the thought that i as the
gordwn-nasmyth expedition was to sell
ihe stuff to myself as business organ-
izations and lie further exasperated
me by insisting on having our bargain
in writing in the form of a letter
he insisted

  all right  acquiesced in the
form of a letter here goes get a
light

  and the apology he said folding
up the letter

  all right i said apology

  my hand shook with anger as i wrote
and afterward i could not sleep for bate
of him at last  got up  suffered

i found from an unusual clumsiness i
i struck my toe against my cabin door
and cut myself as  shaved  found
myself at lat pacing the deck under
the dawn in a mood of extreme exas- j
peration the sun rose abruptly and
splashed light blindingly into my eyes i
and i swore at the sun i found myself i
imagining fresh obstacles with the men i
and talking aloud in anticipatory re- i
hearsal of the consequent row 

  the malaria of the quap was already j
in my blood

-

  i can witness that the beach and mud i
for two miles or more either way were i
lifeless-lifeless as i could have imag- i
ined no tropical mud could ever be and i
all the dead branches and leaves and i
rotting dead fish and so forth that i
drifted ashore became presently shriv- i
eled and white sometimes crocodiles i
would come up out of the water and i
bask and now and then water-birds i
would explore the mud and rocky ribs i
that rose out of it in a mood of transi- i
torv speculation that was its utmost i
animation and the air felt at one i
hot ami austere dry and blistering and i
altogether different to the warm moist i
embrace that had met us at our first i
african landfall and to which we had i
grown accustomed

  i believe that the primary influence
of the quap upon us was to increase i
the conductivity of our nerves but that
is a mere unjustifiable speculation on i
my part at any rate it gave a sort
of east-wind effect to life we all bl
came irritable clumsy languid and dis-
posed to be impatient with our languor
we moored the brig to the rocks with 
difficulty and got aground on mud ami i
decided to stick there and tow off whenh
we had done-the bottom was as greasy j
as butter our efforts to fix up planks
and sleepers in order to wheel the quapj
aboard were as ill-conceived as that sortlj

h
tono-bungay

of work can be-and that sort of work
can at times be very ill-conceived the
captain had a superstitious fear of his
hold he became wildly gesticulatory
and expository and incompetent at the
bare thought of it his shouts still
echo in my memory becoming as each
crisis approached less and less like any
known tongue

  but i cannot now write the history
of those days of blundering and toil of
how milton one of the boys fell from
a plank to the beach thirty feet per-
haps with his barrow and broke bis
arm and i believe a rib of how i and
pollack set the limb and nursed him
through the fever that followed of how
one man after another succumbed to
a feverish malaria and how i-by vir-
tue of my scientific reputation-was
obliged to play the part of doctor and
dose them withquinin and then find-
ing that worse than nothing with rum
and small doses of a sirup of which
there chanced to be a case of bottles
aboard-heaven and gordon-nasmyth
know why for three long days we lay
in misery and never shipped a barrow-
load then when they resumed the
mens hands broke out into sores
there were no gloves available and i
tried to get them while they shoveled
and wheeled to cover their hands with
stockings or greased rags they would
not do this on account of the heat and
discomfort this attempt of mine did
however direct their attention to the
quap as the source of their illness and
precipitated what in the end finished
our lading an informal strike weve
had enough ol this they said anti they
meant it they came aft to say as
much they cowed the captain

  i hrough all these days the weather
was variously vile first a furnace heat
tinder a sky of a scowling intensity of
blue then a hot fog that stuck iti ones
throat like wool and turned the men on
the planks into colorless figures of
giants then a wild burst of thunder-
storms mad elemental uproar and rain

 hrough it all against illness hat
confusion of mind one master impetn
prevailed with me to keep the shipping
going to maintain one motif at least
whatever else arose or ceased the chuff
of the spades the squeaking shrie-
of the barrows the pluppa pluppa
pluppa as the men came trotting along
the swinging high planks and then at
last the dollop dollop as the stuft shot
into the hold another barrow-load
thank god another fifteen hundred
or it may be two thousand pounds for
the saving of ponderevo

  i found out many things about mv-
self and humanity in those weeks of
effort behind mordet island i under-
stand now the heart of the sweater of
the harsh employer of the nigger-
driver i had brought these men into
a danger they didnt understand i was
fiercely resolved to overcome their op-
positions and bend and use them for
my purpose and i hated the men but
i hated all humanity during the time
that the quap was near me

  and my mind was pervaded too by
a sense of urgency and by the fear that
we should be discovered and our pro-
ceedings stopped i wanted to get out
to sea again-to be beating up north-
ward with our plunder i was afraid
our masts showed to seaward and might
betray us to some curious passer on
the high seas and one evening near
the end i saw a canoe with three na-
tives far off down the lake i got field-
glasses from the captain and scrutinized
them and i could see them staring at
us one man might have been a half-
breed and was dressed in white they
watched us for some time very quietly
and then paddled off into some channel
in the forest shadows

  and for three nights running so that
it took a painful grip upon my inflamed
imagination i dreamed of my uncles
face only that it was ghastly white like
a clowns and the throat was cut from
ear to ear-a long ocherous cut too
late he said too late

the come-on

by a m chisholm

author of  aro wedding betts  the mother lode etc

    t he man who knows it all is usually an insufferable acquaintance with
ills cock-sureness his air of condescending superiority however he is good
plucking yes the ery best for a inan who knows more and doesnt brag
about it promoters sharpers and schemers of all sorts like to get hold of
this know-it-all kind of man chisholm tells tis of such a case in his char
acteristically humorous fashion

he soft light of an
-april evening bathed
ardendale tenderly in
its gentle purity the
pale green of the new
leafage was the color
of the sea down the
quiet streets the order-
ly rows of horse-chestnuts and maples
were beginning to put on foliage and
in the gardens the lilac buds were
bursting through the black moist
earth of the flower-beds tiny snow-
drops pushed their way and the spcar-
bls-jed leaves of tulips stood stiffly up-
right

  in the library of mr thomas p
hoopers residence on one of the most
exclusive streets of ardendale his
daughter miss maisie hooper sat with
her fiance mr j addison mortimer

  but twenty-five thousand dollars
would he plenty for us to marry on
ad she said and you are so clever
that with your education you could get
a good salary anywhere im sure that
pa would help you to a position here

  i dont want a position replied
mortimer i ie was an exceedingly mod-
ern young man inclined to stoutness
as to person and supercilious as to ex-
pression a widely advertised college
had thrown an education at him and
some fragments of it had stuck in

common with many others he made the i
mistake of assuming that a degree was i
of intrinsic value  and he held strong- i
ly to the belief that he was a thorough- i
ly shrewd man of the world he con- 
tin ued

  twenty-five thousand isnt so much i
i know plenty of men who have half i
of that a year and they think theyre i
poor of course if we were satisfied to i
settle down in a little house in this i
back-number village and vegetate we i
could get along but it wont do lor me i
i regard this legacy simply as a nest- j
egg you watch me make it hatch a i
clutch of dollars well live in a real i
town maisie with a couple of autos i
and a yacht and diamonds for you 
tell you ill make some of these old
fogies who salt down their coin into
five per cent farm mortgages sit up j
and take notice ill be worth a mil-
lion in ten years

   hope so ad said maisie admir- j
ingly i know how clever you arejj
but  dont like the idea of your goinglj
west to that mining place you spokejl
of its so far away

  railways and telegraph-lines havej
cut down the circumference of thej
world many times said mr mortimerjj
with an air of superiority the westj
is the place to make money and in thisji
new mining-town galena i will find all 
the come-on



  sorts of opportunities why young
 hackett tolfl me that his father the
 senator often buys a claim for five
 hundred dollars and sells it for a cool
 hundred thousand its capital thats
 wanted heres how it is say i
 strike some old miner with a good
 property i buy half his interest for
 a thousand dollars then we form a
 joint stock-company with a capital of
 a million of this i have five hundred
 i j thousand shares worth a dollar each

say i sell them at fifty per cent of
 thv ir par value theres a quarter of a
million or if i let them go at twenty-
five per cent even they would bring
 me one hundred and twenty-five thou-

	sand dollars

   my exclaimed maisie in admira-
tion could you do it ad its an
 awfully big profit

   its the way all big money is made
i nowadays said mortimer compla-
cently im just giving you the bare
i outline and putting it simply so that
you can understand it joint stock-
i companies are the basis of modern
 finance ive given you one example

 and then i know a dozen other ways
of making a killing i wont touch any-
 thing that doesnt look like big money

  youll know about mines of
 course said maisie innocently you
 studied geology didnt you

 	a little admitted mortimer mod-
 estly but you dont need to know
anything about mines to make money
out of them its not the mining that
 theres money in-h the manipulating
of the stock

  a week later j addison mortimer
 took train for the west

ii

  the brakeman announced galena
 city in a weird language of his own
 and immediately thereafter the air set
 friction to the flying heels of number
  west-bound vs she slackened way
 mr j addison mortimer arose and
 followed an obsequious porter bearing
 bis grip

   which is the best hotel here he
 a ed the ebony one as they stood to-

 gether in the vestibule the porter
 scratched his tight-wooled poll apolo-
 getically

  ah dunno sub lie said doubtful-
ly devs diffunt fom hotels back
east an ahse new on tie run

  for which shortcoming he received
but a measly two bits instead of the
expected half-dollar and in conse-
quence dumped the grip with slight
ceremony on the station-platform leav-
ing its owner to shift for himself

  as mortimer stood uncertainly on
the platform in the falling rain jostled
by muddy and unkempt men he pre-
sented much the air of a sleek pert
young spaniel suddenly shot into a
company of lean sinewy sled-dogs he
was carefully dressed with an effect of
studied negligee eminently proper for a
mining-town his clothes of rough
tweed fitted him well  his head was
covered by an expensive pearl-gray soft
felt hat and his shoes were tan heavily
soled and quite unsoiled as a great
concession lo the free-and-easy spirit
of the west his collar was a full half-
inch lower than usual but his air of
cock-sureness was quite intact

  tie picked up his grip and walked up
the station-platform a lanky indi-
vidual stood watching the receding
train a stained and worn pony hat
was tilted over his eyes his trousers
were tucked into mud-spattered boots
and he sucked on a ragged cigar to
him mortimer turned for information

  excuse me he began politely

  the lanky man slowly withdrew his
eyes from the vanishing coaches and
surveyed his interlocutor the eyes
were a cold blue expressionless and
calm

  sure he replied but dont do it
again

  mortimer was uncertain whether he
had offended unconsciously or whether
tle other was making fun of him

  can you direct me to a good hotel
he said with dignity

  this simple request seemed to sur-
prise the lanky man

  you wouldnt want a quiet board-
in-house with the advantages an re-
m

the popular magazine

finements of a christian home would

you he asked

  i said a hotel said mortimer with
added dignity

  a high-grade modem first-class
house caterin to the best trade sug-
gested the other

  yes replied mortimer

  young teller said the stranger
solemnly this here is galena city-
not heaven nor bos ting nor yet noo
york nor chi if youre of a con-
tented disposition sos you can thank
god for a chance to shake dice for a
third share in a one-man bed and three
squares of air-tights a day go to the
palace  if youre particlar build a hotel
for yourself

  mortimer went to the palace where
his modest demand for a room and bath
was met by a counter-proposition of a
billiard-table and sufficient whisky to
insure sound slumber thereon or there-
under the house was crowded but he
finally secured a room in common with
a stranger and thought himself in luck
to do so

  for some days he looked about him
seeking an opportunity for investment
investments there were in plenty  not
a man but was ready to put a figure on
anything he owned or might acquire
but the figures were invariably high
and mortimer was looking for a gilt-
edged proposition-one that would
yield him one hundred per cent profit
and show it on its face modest
gambles on quarter interests in un-
proved claims he passed up as too
risky and too slow

  his first unfavorable impressions of
galena city were confirmed the town
wras raw and hopelessly vulgar as well
as exceedingly dirty it rained with-
out intermissi n-a slow soaking driz-
zle of needlelike streams that turned
the yellow and red clays to clinging
paste which gripped boots with a de-
spairing clutch

  on the principle that so much water
without needed a corrective within the
entire white population of galena male
and female after their kind imbibed
freely of more or less undiluted alcohol
the only workers appeared to be

swedes and chinamen lowly amphi-
bians unaffccted by the prevailing
damp	

  naturally disputes liquor-born and
otherwise took place one gun-fight
of w hich mortimer chanced to be a wit-
ness occurred in a combined saloon and
gambling-house until he dies peace-
fully in an ardendale immaculate bed
with nurses physicians and offspring
unto the second generation in attend-
ance mortimer will remember ii-the
sudden hush of voices the cold delib- 
erate whip-lash word flung across the 
silence following it vengefully the
staccato bang of the guns the upward
leap of their muzzles the wild stam-
pede of the onlookers for safety and
then the coughing man who dropped to
his knees beneath the pistol-spread
haze dying as he fell five minutes
after every game was going full-blast i

  all this was different from arden- 
dale from college from the east it i
was raw unrefined shocking xever- i
theless mortimer filled ten pages lettcr-
size and sent them to maisic hooper i
two of the pages bore his impressions i
of galena two more described the i
fight and ingeniously explained his i
presence thereat three contained an i
appreciation of the peril in which he i
had stood from stray bullets and specu-
lated on the feelings of his correspond- i
ent if he had been accidentally killed
and the other three were of a private i
personal nature-the kind that men i
curse and bum in after years if they h
have the luck to reclaim them and j
women treasure in secret places for thel
term of their natural lives maisie
cried a little as she read and kissed the
signature

            iii

  it was on the day after the gun-fight
that mortimer mounting three flights j
of stairs to his room in the palace j
disgusted with galena and pondering j
the advisability of leaving for the east i
found a stranger in possession of tlicjj
apartment lie surveyed him with an 
unfriendly eye

  the newcomer who was bending i
over a grip rose at his entrance he
the come-on



 was some years mortimers senior of
 medium height but remarkably well
 built his face was shrewd and alert
 and deeply tanned he wore a neatly
 trimmed pointed beard and his clothes
 as mortimer noted with grudging ap-
 proval fitted hirn to perfection

   sorry to intrude said the stran-
 ger i tried to get a room to myself
 but such a thing wasnt to be had i
 wont incommode you more than i can
 help and im clean anyway

   tt all right said mortimer rather
 more cordially than lie had intended
 there was something likable about the
 stranger he seemed to be a gentle-
 man at any rate ive had a room-
 i mate of some sort ever since i came

 some of them- he ended the

 - sentence with a gesture of disgust

rather impossible i guess said the
 stranger with a genial laugh galena
and misfortune make strange bed-fel-
lows but then you have probably
i seen worse layouts than this in your
 experience and so have i a man cant
travel extensively without running into
i some queer things

j addison mortimers traveling ex-
i periences might have been compressed
into a small leaflet but he was not dis-
pleased at being taken for a seasoned
t traveler he said

   yes thats so the people who stay
 at home dont see much life

   having thus accomplished an in-
 formal acquaintance they observed the
f formalities by exchanging cards that

	which mortimer received bore the name
 charles anson collingwood mr

 collingwoods address was chicago but
 the card gave no indication of the busi-
 ness of its owner

   collingwood changing to clothes ir-
 reproachable in cut but plainly intended

	for hard service shrugged himself into
i a worn yellow slicker and disappeared
v nor did mortimer see him till evening

 when lie reappeared mud-stained and
 dripping from an afternoon apparently
 spent about the mines

   mortimer watched his ablutions from
l the bed on which he lay

been seeing the town he asked
town be hanged collingwood

rubbed his hair into fluffy dryness with
a rough towel no ive been chasing
about in half a dozen properties sizinq
them up

  mortimer digested this information
collingwood looked the part of a mi-
ning expert and it occurred to him
that his acquaintance might be worth
cultivating if the latter knew of any
good thing he might get in on the
ground floor

  you are a mining man then he
queried

  collingwood smiled and shrugged his
broad shoulders

  i am an investment specialist he
said never heard of that particular
line of business before i dare say 
mortimer confessed that he had not
ill have to qualify it a little said
collingwood of course there are a
number of fields of investment of which
i have no knowledge-no one man can
cover everything my specialties are
rather restricted but mining happens
to be one of them people back east
have gone crazy over galena anil i am
here to look at the ground for some
of them

  there ought to be good chances for
investment said mortimer tentatively

  plenty of chances to sink money
returned collingwood skeptically the
good things cant be bought with much
profit

  but there are plenty of claims and
prospects said mortimer lie was
curious to ascertain the pecialits
opinion of this class of investment for
up to date it had been the only sort
offered him

   a prospect is a hole in the ground
owned by an infernal liar quoted
collingwood with conviction i
never touch them my business repu-
tation wouldnt stand it what t want
to find is a good mine in need of capi-
tal and thats a hard matter

  im looking for an investment my-
self sard mortimer importantly but
so far ive seen nothing that commends
itself to my judgment

  the next day they becamc better
acquainted on the second night they
dined together and by some magic
	the popuunt magazine

collingwood was a me to obtain a far
better meal than mortimer bad yet
eaten at the palace wine followed
and cigars both paid for by coliiug-
wood

  no no-nonsense be said wheat
mortimer insisted weakly on being al-
lowed to hold up bis end youre
out here for your own hand and while
the size of your pile i none of my busi-
ness it s a good bet that ihe people
behind me can afford to pay for a litile
sparkle better than either of us heav-
ens man ive bathed old swedes in
champagne anti they thought it was
cider-ail in the way of business and
ive paid for a few days bender lor
half a dozen wild and woolly gentle-
men and the bill ran into the thou-
sands what little we can drink and
smoke will cut no ice in my expense-
money

 mortimer sipped his champagne
critically his acquaintance with the
beverage was not extensive being con-
fined to an occasional modest pint by
way of celebration but he would not
have this easy-going high-priced invest-
ment specialist who was plainly used
to the best suspect that expensive wines
were a rarity with him the cigars
too were of a better quality than he
had thought it possible to obtain in
galena certainly he had never seen
them in the hotel show-case and they
evidently cost much more than bis or-
dinary smokes

  when one bottle was finished an-
other succeeded it at the end of an
hour mortimer was talking freely and
boastfully lie was of that class for
whom liquor smoothes away all diffi-
culties of accomplishment who esteem
the thing desired as already done his
modest twenty-five thousand dollars ex-
panded into an indefinite sum of large
dimensions and he hinted solemnly at 
plans involving huge amounts and he
was not consciously lying the peculiar
thing about it was that he really be-
lieved every ward he uttered and con-
sidered himself a young napoleon of
finance

  collingwood listened in silence save
for an occasional word although he

had taken hi full share of wine it had
not affected him to speech with lis

hat tilted a little over bib shrewd eyes
and a cigar in the corner of his mouth

he barkened gravely occasionally fill-
ing mortimers glass

  youre a wise guy-whatt said the
latter sit solemns ol owl an ay
nothing why dont you cheer up
some 

   like to hear you talk replied col-
lingwood youve got ideas and the
gift of expressing them im enjoy- 

ing myself

  som  said mortimer youre
a good fellow best ive struck in the
mudhole say lets go into business 
together

  youve got too much capital for
me said collingwood gravely how
much did you say you were ready to i
invest here if you got a good chance
twenty thousand said mortimer
proudly look here ive got money
and ideas but  want experience
youll get that before lung said
collingwood without a smile

  this is all new to me utmerstan
pursued mortimer unconsciously
now youre right in touch wiih
things if i ask you for advice as a
friend youll give it to me wont you
or maybe you could give me the
straight tip if you found a good thing
well you know said collingwood
evasively good things dont las and
have to be snapped up every time
theres a cinch play you can figure on
half a dozen men fighting for the first
chance to get their dollars down on it
you have to have real money-cash-
to put on the board and as a rule
theres no time to look twice at a
proposition	 	i

  i unncrstan all that said morti-
mer nodding his head with tipsy grav-
ity im no piker ive got twenty
thousand to my credit in the bank here
and five thousand more at home and
t can plank down the cash on a good
thing in half an hour

   id like to oblige von said col ling-
wood doubtfully put-you see-well
pm not working for myself suppose
i got hold of a good thing and turned
the come-on

h 

it over to you what would my people
say if they heard of it do you sup-
pose theyd give me business again
not on your life and  couldnt blame
them

  i wouldnt say a word about it
protested mortimer

  these things always get out some-
how returned collingwood id
strain a point for you but i cant af-
ford to throw down my principals it
wouldnt be square and you shouldnt
ask it

  thats right said mortimer i
wouldnt ask you to do anything dis-
honorable business is business
though he proceeded knowingly id
make it worth your while

  if i gave you a tip at all said
collingwood as if offended at the of-
fer it would be as a friend and i
wouldnt lake a commission you
havent got money enough to buy me
mortimer understand that

  mortimer protested that he had
never thought of such a thing and
collingwood accepted his statement

  ill see what i can do for you out
of friendship only he said snaps
are not to be picked up every day but
if i find what i think is a good thing
ill let you know about it and then you
can use your own judgment

   youre all liight exclaimed morti-
mer i like you lets have another
bottle on me

  not for me said collingwood
ive had enough and my head has to
be clear in the morning by the way
til at room of ours isnt very comfort-
able and ive been trying for something
better if i get another would you care
to bunk in with me or stay where you
are 

  im with you said mortimer the
bests none too good for me he ex-
hibited a large roll of bills drew out
a bundle this morning he said boast-
fully	
collingwood had obtained a room on
the first floor and thither he and mor-
timer moved their grips the new
apartment was large and well furnished
and held two beds it was a vast im-


provement on the little room on the
fourth floor

  mortimer dropped into a chair in a
few minutes he was nodding colling-
wood lighting a fresh cigar paced the
floor softly observing him

  confound it he said suddenly i
was to see a man to-night and i was
so interested in our conversation that
i clean forgot about it he consulted
his watch i may catch him yet you
wont mind my running away for half
an hour old man 

   s all right said mortimer sleep-
ily you toddle along and ill have a
little snooze then well finish the eve-
ning somewhere

iv

  collingwood left the hotel and made
his way toward the outskirts of ga-
lena where dodging mud-puddles gin-
gerly he finally arrived at a small shack
of undressed and unpainted lumber
he opened the door without ceremony

  inside a man in shirt-sleeves sat play-
ing solitaire he was some years older
than collingwood his clean-shaven
face was thoughtful studious and very
honest his eyes were blue and frank
as a childs indeed their expression
was almost wistful as he played he
made note of the recurring card com-
binations in a small note-book

  he nodded absently to collingwood
and carefully placed a card and shifted
a pile the next deal exhausted the
possibilities he threw the cards into a
heap	x 

  well  he queried

  why dont you get a new game
rasped collingwood impatiently try
building-blocks or something hard
the other snorted

  you think romallys solitaire is
easy do you know how many chances
you have of solving it just one in
seven thousand and forty-five

  what a lead-pipe it would be tn
keep a bank on a game like that col-
lingwood commented recovering his
good humor all right frank thr v
the whole pack in the discard for a few
days this is where you get busy


the vovular magazine

  im glad of it said llic other
when t came to galena i didnt figure
on living in a blasted packing-box
with a bunch of assorted mountam-rats
for company any time i have to see
rats i want some fun first and these
are too genuine besides if you want
to know it im down to white chips
if youd quit spoiling good paper
trying to figure out a system to beat
cinch games youd have a roll you
couldnt carry observed collingwood
it gets by me why a smart man like
you is sucker enough to hand his coin
to a hunch of gams but vouu do it
till you die frapk duprau

  duprau glanced guiltily at licet of
paper covered with intricate calculations
lying on the bare pine table

  some day ill just choke em -to
death he said with conviction ive
made mistakes in calculation ill ad-
mit and  got what was coming to me
this time im all right im figuring
out a system thats a sure winner
when i get it ill let you in on it

  after youve tried it and theyve got
to you for your roll again come to me
and ill stake you a couple of hundred
if i have it said collingwood you
ought to have more sense you know
a game for a brace and a skin and yet
you skip to it with your little old tin
dollars and feed them into the hopper
if it was on the square you couldnt
win youre dotty on systems that keep
you poor but its your money and
theres more coming now forget your
infernal systems and listen to me
for ten minutes he talked earnestly
at the fin of that lime duprau pro-
duced a safety ink-bottle and a bundle
of oc-certificates the latter were
blank lie began to fill in names and
signatures the ink he used was pe-
culiar even as it flowed from the pen
it lost it- brilliancy and turned a brown-
ish black-the exact color of writing a
year or more old

  collingwood watched him in silence
until the work was completed

  it may take three or four days
he said as soon as the deal is closed
wire me your train leaves in two
hours well meet yon in red cloud

good-by  said duprvm

    till then
reaching fur ashenof paper
hours til tram-time you say i want

to do a little figuring--

   collingwood snatched the paper away
from him and gathering up the pack of
cards shoved both in his pocket

   no solitaire or figuring out sys-
tems he said firmly you never
know when to top and  want you out
of town to-night do i have to see you
on the train or will you cut it out 
guess id better cut it duprau ad-
mitted reluctantly ill have lots of
spare time in the next few days ah
right what you say goes

  collingwood retraced his way
through the mud and mounted to bis
room at the hotel lie fully expected
to find mortimer there but to his dis-
gust the room was empty he searched
the hotel immediately

   that bostonese jag said the bar-
tender in answer to his inquiry yes
he was in here and i make him a joey
brown he licks it up and asks me
where he can find a swift game i tell
him most anywheres but hell get
skinned quickcr at careys then he
gives me the glassy glare and fetches
the door in three tacks

  to careys went collingwood and
there lie found mortimer bucking faro-
bank the joey brown on top of the
champagne had done the business for
he was very drunk indeed he had
been allowed to win but he was now
losing and with the fatuity of the loser
he was increasing his bets

   collingwood laid a hand on his shoul-
der how are you making it go he
asked

  for answer mortimer swore thickly
and put a fiftv-dollar bill on the eight
open he lost again

  if youve had enough fun for one
night said collingwood i want you
to come with me ive got onto a good
thing and ive made an appointment
for you the man i waiting now 
let m wait cried mortimer im
going to break this game

   hang the game said collingwood
theres big money in sight if you come
with me let the game go on you
the come-on

                 v

can come back and break it up to-
morrow

  beside the dealer stood carey the
owner of the house an old-time gam-
bler with an unsavory reputation mor-
timer seemed a fairly plump pigeon to
be plucked and he resented colling-
woods interference

  stranger he said your friend is
backing his judgment his own way he
dont need to be night-herded let
him alone

  collingwood looked him straight in
the eye the gambler met his gaze
squarely they sized each other up

  you mean well said collingwood
coldly but i guess that lets you out
he turned to mortimer come along
old man

  but mortimer would not come
careys remark had had the desired
effect

  you lemme lone he said thickly
see you in mornin

  but collingwood for reasons of his
own was not willing to allow him to
lose more money to carey he adapted
himself quickly to the situation

  guess i might as well make a night
of it too then he said let me in
on the game

  he ordered a drink and watched
mortimer throw it down his throat
with satisfaction he pressed  him
a particularly black and heavy cigar
carey watched these tactics with a
scowl at the end of fifteen minutes
during which he had lost but moder-
ately mortimers head began to sag
two minutes after he fell sidewise from
his chair and became unconscious

  carey beckoned to two men take
him up-stairs and put him to bed he
ordered

  collingwood interposed

  hardly lies going back to his
hotel

  is he said carey theres
where you make a mistake when a
man gets full in my house i look after

him

  mice benevolent custom too said
collingwood ill save you the trouble
this time hes going with me



  carey his face impassive as ever
leaned forward

   see here stranger he said youre
just a little too positive in your views
to stay popular without giving of-
fense im telling yon that i dont let a
man i dont know handle a drunk with
money in his clothes and i dont
know you

   it sounds all right retorted col-
lingwood my objection to leaving
him here is just the opposite i do know
you

  the controversy was attracting at-
tention the lookout on his stool
pinched out the end of a cigarette and
dropped it  the floor gently sliding
his hand into his coat pocket the
game was suspended and clear spaces
opened automatically behind both
carey and collingwood it was signifi-
cant of the experience of the two that
neither had raised his voice their
tones were almost confidential but cold
as cut ice

  careys eyelids narrowed and
drooped a little lower twenty years
before-fifteen ten even-he would
have shot as the last word left collim -
woods lips but now a gun was to
be employed only as a last resort and
he felt that he could not afford to gain
much more notoriety even in galena

   stranger he said in a level voice
the more ominous by its absolute calm
i wouldnt say no more tilings like that
if i was you theyre apt to affect
your plans for the future now here
it is he went on dismissing the re-
mark with a large wave of his slim
hand if youre a friend of this man
id rather youd take care of him and
save me the trouble on the other hand
as youre a stranger i cant let you do
it its up to you

  well we neednt block business
talking about it said collingwood
accepting the flag of truce thus held
aloft let me see you in private for
a moment

  later j addison mortimer entered
his apartments at the palace assisted by
collingwood and another man inci-
dentally he wa- quite unaware of the
fact and manner of his home-coming


 he popular magazine

  when he opened his eyes in the
morning mortimer groaned and shut
them again his eyeballs felt as if
some one had tried to gouge them from
their socket his head was -ne large
pain when he moved it on the pillow
and his mouth and tongue seemed lined
with dry upstanding fur the taste
when he endeavored to moisten them
was a compound of umber and burned
sienna he groaned once more

  collingwood splashing vigorously at
the wash-stand turned a whimsical eye
on the bed

  good morning he said pleasantly
mortimer raised himself to a sitting
posture and took his repentant head
between bis bands i must have had
an awful one he said where did
we go last night i dont remember
coliiugwooa outlined the events of
the evening i dont know how much
you dropped at carevs he said i
tried to get you away but you wouldnt
quit im afraid it cost you something
and i nearly had a row with carey
too he didnt like my butting in
mortimer examined his pockets

  i drew five j-mdred yesterday he
said ruefully and heres all i have
left he exhibited a very small roll
of bills i was a chump all right
dont know bow i came to get such a
 ad tisuallv i can carry more than
that -

  collingwood behind the towel
smiled sardonically

  youre a tank he said with feigned
admiration  feel a shade rocky my-
self and  didnt try to stay with you
ive ordered a couple of revivers after
that well have breakfast and then if
you feel like it come around with me
while i look at some properties
breakfast on mortimers part was al-
most a farce but he managed to worry
down a small portion of food and sev-
eral cup of coftee after which he felt
better mis bead though dull had ceased
to ache and while his regret at the loss
of so much money was keen it was
tempered by the comforting thought
that lie had acted in a manner befitting

a man of the world lie even contem-
plated with satisfaction a confession to
maisie hooper and pictured her
shocked attitude which should conceal
a secret admiration and her forgive-
ness following bis promise never to
gamble again

   hey spent the morning in and about
the nearest mines gradually morti-
mers headache vanished and his spirits 
rose collingwood was an entertain-
ing and instructive companion and his
manner of meeting and handling men
excited mortimers admiration lie
wished that he possessed the cool as-
surance and matter-of-course business-
like way of his conductor then too
he appeared to know all about the
mines-more indeed than the men in
charge this knowledge was revealed
or rather hinted at more by what he
did not say than by his words at the
end of a long explanation by a fore-
man covering the difficulties encoun-
tered the disappointments and the
-haracter and extent of existing and
hoped-tur veins a shrewd question or
comment would go to the root of the
matter as surely as a surgeons knife
and after leaving a property his terse
comments were conclusive

  nothing there he said as they
rode away from a mucli-tnlked-of mine
they made the too common mistake
put in a high-priced plant up-to-date
machinery and buildings on the
strength of some assays and a lot of
faith and when they had spent a
quarter of a million on such things
they went to work to prove the prop-
erty now it doesnt pan out and
they are trying to explain value into
a worthless claim their whole layout
isnt worth junk prices

  but at one property they were re-
fused admission a man sat smoking
on a powder-box by the shaft-mouth

  no one allowed in the mine he
said briefly

  whats the matter asked colling-
wood timbering bad or what

  orders replied the other lacon-
ically	  j

  how is your ore running r asked
collingwood
the come-on



  dont know

   working or shut down 

  sorter half and half

  save for the man on the powder-
box the place appeared to be absolute-
ly deserted

  anv oue in the mine now

  nopg

  thats the silver queen said col-
lingwood as they rode on they went
in on rich ore and it pinched out
theyve been working it half-hearted-
ly for some time i hear maybe theyve
shift down for good he was thought-
ful for a few moments you cant
tell i wish i could have had a look
at it they may have uncovered the
vein again

  in that case theyd be working it
wouldnt they  asked mortimer with
an air of shrewdness

  hard to say they may be raising
money to do it on a larger scale al-
though i dixl hear that there are monied
men in it now

  later they encountered a buckboard
drawn by a pair of wiry ponies in it
sat a large military-looking man elder-
ly with well-kept white mustache and
goatee his face fairly radiated good
nature and benevolence he greeted
collingwood cordially

  iiow are you colonel  returned
collingwood with equal cordiality al-
low me to introduce my friend mr
mortimer-colonel jefferson casimir
glad to make your acquaintance
sell said the colonel in a soft typically
southern drawl seeing the mines
you couldnt have a betteh guide than
my young friend here i hope to see
more of you sell

  mortimer responded in kind he
liked colonel casimir at first sight so
did most men he was so large so
genkd so courteous-the type of a
southern gentleman

  come and dine with me to-night
both of you said the ccdonel im
staying at the commercial cant prom-
ise you much of a dinneh but ill guar-
antee the liquohs and segalis till eight
oclock then

  he gathered up the reins raised his

 broad-brimmed slouch-hat and drove
 on

   colonel casimir said collingwood
 as they watched the swirl of dust
 thrown from the drying road by the
 hying heels of the broncos is heavily
 interested in mining properties else-
 where i didnt know he was in ga-
 lena it looks well for the future of
 the district if he takes an interest in
 it

   dont think i ever heard of him
 said mortimer he seems very pleas-
 ant though

   you will hear of him very often if
 you handle mining properties re-
 turned collingwood yes hes the
 soul of good nature and hospitality and
 honorable to a ridiculous extent judged
 by modern business maxims still i
 never met a shrewder man or one more
 cautious in business ive never known
 him to be taken in you ll find him
 an excellent host too and he has a fund
 of choice original anecdote if we can
 get him started his title isnt a
 courtesy one he was through the war
 but of course he was mighty young
 then

   the dinner at the commercial was
 even belter than that which mortimer
 had enjoyed the night before and
 colonel casimir as host left nothing to
 be desired he seemed greatly taken
 with mortimer and asked his opinion
 several times on various subjects an
 attention which flattered that young
 gentleman greatly

   by the way colonel said colling-
 wood when cigars afire they sipped

	their liqueurs in well-fed comfort we
 tried to have a look at the old silver
 queen lo-day and were politely warned
 off id like to know why i heard
 that there was something doing in that
 property do you happen to know
 anything about it

   and what makes you think i know
 anything returned the colonel enig-
 matically

   so you do know said colling-
 wood come colonel whats the dark
 secret that old hole in the ground
 shouldnt have anything to hide sat-
 isfy my curiosity do


the popular magazine

  colonel castmir removed the long
mack panatela from his lips and let a
thin stream of smoke trickle ceiling-
ward his eyes steel-blue became very
shrewd

  coliinvood he said you are a
business man and-i say it in no of-
fensive sense-tainted with the cuhsed
commercial spirit of this steam-an-
lightnin-drivcn age thereto youll
pardon me im sure if i prefer to keep
my own counsel

  just as you please colonel re-
turned collingwood i suppose i am
a little hit out for any loose coin  its
niv business but so far as that goes
you can look out for yourself if you
cant show a good imitation of the com-
mercial spirit at times id hate to meet
a real business man

   the colonel chuckled

   needs must when the devil drives
seh he observed i stahted life mis-
teh motimer if you will forgive the
personal allusion with two loving par-
ents some thousands of acres of the
best cotton and cane soil in south
calina and enough niggehs to work
the acres my education was liberal in
some lines includin literature hosses
cyards and fiaharms none of them as
youll perceive bein money-makers-
at least in the hands of a gentleman
the war came my father fell in the
w ilderness and my mother survived
him only long enough to hear the news
i fought a mere boy through the war
when lee surrendered and the con-
federacy was broken i tuhned to peace
an the arts of peace the plantation
was mogaged to the hilt as i discov-
ered for the first time it was sold
personal property of every description
had been given freely to the confed-
eracy so that at the age of twenty i
owned only a hoss a path of pistols
and a ragged gray unifom i chucked
tlie unifom traded the hoss for cloes
but kept the pistols i went to work
seh-the first one of my family to do
such a tiling for a hundred yeahs
business was foreign to my instincts
but i stahted right in to acquiah a
knowledge of it and i found seh that
while theres a right smaht of crooks

engaged in it it is in the main bon-
able and  found too cornin right
down to cases that it consist in find-
mg out w nat a thing is worth to an-
other man and buym it from a third
party for a leetle mite less

  or selling it for a little

                           more sug-
gested collingwood as the colonel
paused

   there seh speaks the commercial
spirit which  deplore said the
colonel to mortimer i never sold a
thing for or asked more than it was
worth knowingly i have made mis-
takes in judgment  admit and proper-
ties which i have sold have been mis-
managed by the buyers o that their
value has diminished but i do not hold
myself responsible for that on the
other hand i endeaveh not to pick up
a plate by the hot side and because
of that my young friend here calls me
a hard man at a bargain

  you didnt quite catch my mean-
ing colonel said collingwood i
merely meant that you are able to pro-
tect your own interests

  if i wasnt seh retorted colonel
casimir i wouldnt have any to pro-
tect there are men to-day  regret to
state who have no business or other
honah when i deal with them seh
i hold the cyards tight up against my
chest and count the chips on the table
illustration-your diplomatic si-
lence about the silver queen  sup-
pose said collingwood if that is

your meaning- lie half rose from

his chair

 my deah boy-my deah boy-the
colonel pressed him back gently with
one hand-you mistake me entirely i
feah my language might beah that con-
struction but such a monstrous thing
was never in my thoughts i know
you to be an honahle gentleman and
you are sufficient warrant for the dis-
cretion of your friend whose acquaint-
ance gives me pleasure in proof of
my trust in both of you if proof is
needed i will throw this silveh queen
cyard on the table so that you may see
it for yourself i know that you will
respect my confidence as i would
yours
the come-on



  this silveh queen mine he went
on was a poor propelily but it came
to my ears that a rich strike has just
been made which will put it in the first
ranks of ore-producers the news fil-
tered to me underground i may state
they are however in urgent need of
ready money i offered to buy but they
refused to sell standing out for a sum
which i considered exobitant i there-
to began lo buy shares the company
was stocked for five hundred thousand
dollahs in one-dollah shares non-as-
sessable of course of these fifty thou-
sand are in the treasury unissued
they wont sell them below par now
and they cant sell them at par for they
are not worth it of the remaining
four hundred and fifty thousand i have
options on one hundred and sixty thou-
sand at variqus prices these i will
take up provided i can secure options
on or buy more shares sufficient to give
me control of the company in any
event even if they issue the treasury
shares

  can you get them asked colling-
wood he was penciling rapidly on an
envelope following the statement of
the case with keen interest youll
need roughly speaking one hundred
thousand shares more to retain control
in anyevent as t figure it

  ninety thousand and one to be
exact said coldnel casimir call it
an even hundred thousand which will
give me a control beyond cavil i hope
to get them if my agents can locate the
right man

  but still i dont see why we couldnt
get into the mine this morning said
collingwood

  that replied the colonel is a
part of the game i he present own-
ers naturally want to depress still
further the value of the shares which
are worth little enough on the market
as it is the lawd knows they have
denied the repawt of a strike and have
shut down in that way they hope lo
buy up loosely held stock cheap and
posibly to induce me to allow my op-
tions to expiah-that is if they know
of them which they will sooner or
later

  are these shares strongly held
asked mortimer lie uttered the phrase
in a very businesslike way and he
liked the sound of it it seemed to him
exceedingly technical

  there you go to the root of the
matteh seh said the colonel that
question shows your practical business
mind some of them are and some are
not but there is one block of a hun-
dred thousand owned by a surly can-
tankerous curmudgeon named low-
rey that will give me trouble this
man lowrey was one of the original
owners and for his interest and serv-
ices-for he is a mining engineer and a
good one-he received one hundred
thousand shares in the company that
was formed iiis methods didnt suit
the majority and they dismissed him
and got a new man who made a mess
of things naturally lowrey is dis-
gruntled and i doubt if he will sell his
stock i might induce him to cooperate
with me if i could find him but he
seems to have gone prospecting the
lawd knows where howeveh i am
having him traced let me fill your
glass misteh molimer you are
drinking nothing seh

  mortimer carried away from colonel
jefferson casimirs dinner a most
pleasant impression of his host as well
as a good deal of champagne but so
carcfully had the wine been adminis-
tered that he felt only a grateful ex-
hilaration also he had been received
on an equal footing by this pleasant-
spoken old capitalist and his opinion
on various matters had been asked for
and listened to with respect he felt
that he was at last seeing things from
the inside obtaining an insight into the
methods by which large fortunes are
made unconsciously his manner grew
dignified as became a man of affairs

  going to bed asked collingwood
when they reached their hotel

  think ill write a few letters re-
plied mortimer ive been too busy
for correspondence the last day or
two


the popular magazine

  all said collingwood see you
later then

  mortimer sat down at the writing-
table and set himself to composing a
letter to maisie hooper the cham-
pagne stimulated his ideas and he wrote
freely astonished at the case with which
the apt phrases flowed from ins pen

  at first he had the room to himself
but as he was in the midst of his letter
a man obviously drunk lurched in and
sealing himself opposite began to write
mortimer surveyed him with disgust
which the champagne beneath his own
belt only accentuated why the deuce
didnt they keep the hotel clear of
drunks  the man was unshaven
roughly clad and looked like a miner
there was however something fa-
miliar in his appearance where had
he seen him before

  the newcomer wrote laboriously
chewing a rank cigar which he had
difficulty in keeping alight lie ad-
dressed an envelope but allowed a
huge ink-drop to blot it he discarded
it and addressed another then folding
up his letter he left the room

  mortimer was relieved he finished
his own letter and out of idle curiosity
picked tip the blotted envelope which
lay face up on the table where the
granger had thrown it aside this
was the address he read written in a
rude sprawling hand

mr william j lowrey

              mine engineer

oca ll a la house

corpercliffe

  lowrey why hat was the name
of the holder of one hundred thousand
shares of silver queen stock whom
colonel casimir was trying to locate
he was an engineer too and like a
flash recognition came to mortimer
the man who had addressed the en-
velope was the very man who had sat
smoking on a jxnvder-box at the sil-
ver queen shaft that morning

  holding the envelope in his fingers
mortimer put two and two together
 lore was a man at the stiver queen
writing to one lowrey a mining engi-
neer the balance of probabilities was

against there being two lowrey s bodi
mining engineers and both corre-
spondents of a man employed at that

mine lrgo chance had put him in
possession of a piece of information
very much desired by colonel casimir

  his first impulse was to take the en-
velope to the colonels hotel but imme-
diately a thought struck him why
shouldnt he make something out of it
himself if those shares were neces-
sary to enable the colonel to acquire
control of silver queen he ought  be
willing to pay for them low rey prob-
ably knew nodiing of the reported
strike he might be willing to sell
cheap in that case if he mortimer
could get at him before the letter he
might make a nice little rake-off on
the turnover

  he wondered what collingwood
would advise but he rather doubted the
advisability of confiding in him col-
lingwood was a friend of the coli nel
and besides he might want to rbarc
in the good thing which mortimer de-
sired for himself he determined to
pump him skilfully

  quite a scheme that of the colonels
to get control of silver queen he
observed casually as they smoked a
final cigar before turning in

  most usual thing in the world re-
plied collingwood carelessly no one
buys a property outright now the
better plan is to get control ot the
stock after that you can proceed to
eliminate minority holders and acquire
the shares at your own price

  i dont quite see it said morti-
mer if the property is any good their
stock will increase in value with yours
wont it 

  not if you know the game re-
turned collingwood you having
control can depress the stock artificial-
ly by rumors of all kinds as a last
resort you can amalgamate with an-
other company forming a new one and
assess the holders out of their boots
part of them will forfeit rather than
pay the assessments those who pay
will get watered stock in exchange for
their old holdings and their values will
be cut in half then a little judicious
the come-on



 iligation will usually bring them to the
 selling point lots of ways to do it
 ah said mortimer thoughtfully
 is that what the colonel will do

   no i hardly think so replied col-
 lingwood for one thing lies ab-
 surdly conscientious and for another he
 has enough money already to be square
 in his deanngs must be worth several
 millions by this time

   what do you suppose hed be will-
ing to pay this man lowrey for his
shares

   lowrey oh thats the engineer
well i dont know-havent gone into
it i know the stock has been abso-
lutely unsalable but then the colonel
wants it badly and i guess he has
scooped in about all that is loosely held
if he has confidence in the property he
 might go pretty high-say to forty or
even more

   and do you think lowrey would
sell for that 

   depends on a lot of things if he
is wise to the situation he wont if
the is hard up and sees a chance to un-
load for ready money likely he will and
probably for a good deal less i wish
 had an option on his holdings id
make the old colonel give up strong
for it but its a mighty hard job to
locate a prospector hes probably
stampeding around up above timber-
line somewhere and wont be iii till
the show flies

   mortimer said nothing for some mo-
ments he was more than ever con-
vinced that he possessed valuable in-
formation and he made up his mind not
to share it with collingwood the
question now uppermost in his mind
was how much the colonel would pay
for the shares he was unwilling to
put his money into an uncertainty
j i suppose he remarked tentatively
that if the colonel said he would pay
a certain price for those shares hed
keep his word

i collingwood shot a look at him it
was very keen and an expression
which mortimer did not observe
crossed his face the colonel is strict-
ly honorable he replied when he
promises anything his word is away

ahead of the ordinary mans written
agreement why you dont know
lowrey do you

  never heard of him before said
mortimer with assumed carelessness
i was just wondering if the colonel
was perfectly reliable plenty of men
arent

  well he is said collingwood with
emphasis you can tie right up to
what he says hed keep his word in a
financial matter if it took his last cent
thats one side the other is that he
expects every one else to do the same

  mortimer satisfied changed the sub-
ject much pleased at his own adroit-
ness it remained only to interview
the colonel and obtain a definite prom-
ise from him to take over the stock at
a given price

vii

  mortimer found colonel casimir en-
joying an after-breakfast cigar and
reading the financial news the colonel
was spick and span freshly brushed
cleanly shaven newly polished and
even wore a flower in his buttonhole

  sit down seh-sit down he ex-
claimed cordially motioning mortimer
to a chair fine mawnin misteh
motimer makes me feel almost young
again and how do you find yourself
seh and how is my young friend col-
linwood 

  quite well both of us colonel re-
plied mortimer i ran over this
morning to have a few words with you
about a matter of business

  the colonel did not appear surprised
in that case seh he said per-
haps it would be as well for us to im-
bibe our mawnin drink first

  not for me thank you colonel
mortimer declined i really can stay
only a minute

  well sighed the colonel regretful-
ly you young men pusue wealth to
the exclusion of rational enjoyment
pfayeh seh and a propeh amount of
stimulant hindeh no mans journey but
as you please pemit me to offer you
a jegah

mortimer took the long black pana-


thb popular magazine

  tela and bit off the end nervously the
  colonel cut a v in its counterpart with
  exceeding care lighted it and turned
  an eye of bland inquiry on the other

    you spoke of business sell he
  hinted gently

    about the silver queen shares
  said mortimer endeavoring to speak
  indifferently  gathered from your
  conversation last night that you were
  anxious to buy a control

    i was speaking in confidence seh
  said the colonel but it is a fact what
  then seh have you slock to dispose
  of

    not exactly said mortimer but i
  happen to know-that is i think i could
  perhaps find some

    colonel casimir stroked his goatee

    the fact is seh he said  am
  through foolin about with small lots
  i want enough to give me the control
  or nothing

    this isnt a small lot said morti-
  mer

    n-o the colonels face expressed
  polite doubt

    one hundred thousand shares said
  mortimer

    the colonel sat upright and regarded
  him with interest

   have you an option on them he
  asked with what seemed to be hardly
  concealed eagerness

    well-not yet hesitated mortimer
  i know who has them though he
  added as the colonel sank back in his
  chair	 

    without bein discourteous said
  colonel casimir i have known as
  much for some time when you speak
  of a block of one hundred thousand
  shares- assume it is in one block-
  i also nachuliy assume that you mean
  lowreys holding am  right

    yes mortimer admitted

    quite so well then seh i pre-
  sume you have information as to his
  whereabouts

   perhaps i have said mortimer
  with what he considered a knowing

	air the point is colonel if i can de-
  liver you one hundred thousand shares
  what will you pay for them

  colonel casimir smoked for a mo-
ment or two in silence

  are you in a position to guarantee
delivery he asked

  not exactly mortimer replied

  the colonel shook his head

  jthen i cant make you a definite
offer for what you may or may not be
able to sell if you came to me shares
in hand it might be different

   dont see why said mortimer

i only want to know what they will be
worth if i can et them if  cant
get them that settles it

  the fact is said colonel casimir
that time is impotant in this matt eh
they mjgbt be worih more to me to-
day than a week hence or they might
not i cant make you a definite offer
sell open for an indefinite time if i
make one at all there must be a time
limit on it

  how long asked mortimer

  the colonel considered stroking his 
goatee mortimer waited anxiously

  put it this way if in three days 
you can deliver me one hundred thou- j
sand silver queen i will pay fifty cents i
per share if after that up to one week
i will pay fotv after that i dont want
them at all ill foleit my options and i
stand my loss

  thats satisfactory said mortimerft
relieved  hope to get then in three
days

  very good seh said-the colonel
of course you undeetand that in the
meantime my agents will continue their
inquiries and if they can locate the
owneh of this block and buy the shares
for me they will be quite within their
rights

  of course i understand that mor-i
timer replied thats fair would you
mind giving me a little memorandunit
of the agreement colonel

  my word seh said glonel casi-
mir with dignity is prolrly as bind
ing as any writing and yet you area
quite right moden business destroys
old-fashioned ideas of honah you shalh
have vour memorandum seh	j

  with the brief note penned by th
colonel in his pocket mortimer almosw
ran to the bank where he kept his ac-j
the come-on



  count for the train for coppercliffe
was due in half an hour as he would
need ready money to deal with a total
stranger such as lowrey he withdrew
almost his entire balance leaving only a
nominal sum to keep the account open
on the two-hundred-mile run lo cop-
percliffe he was nervous and excited
and frequently fell the inside pocket in
which he carried his money to make
absolutely sure of its possession he
tried to formulate a plan of action which
should give lowrey no inkling of the
value of the shares and yet adequately
explain his desire to buy them  but he
failed to do so and made up his mind
to confine himself to a cash offer and
refuse all explanations

viii

  he arrived in coppercliffe late that
night and went to the ogallala house
investigation of the register showed
lowreys signature a couple of days
old

air lowrey here still he asked

  it appeared that lowrey was still in
the hotel furthermore he was sick
and confined to his room

  as an attempt to see him that night
might have given the impression that
the matter was urgent mortimer de-
cided to wait till morning taking a
chance on being before the letter which
he had seen the silver queen man write
-a letter which doubtless bore on the
value of the property but which the
writer might have been too drunk to
mail

  after breakfast he sent up his card
to lowreys room

  mr lowreys sick said the bell-
hop returning he dont want to see
no one

 mortimer slid a half-dollar into his
receptive paw you just show me up
he said

i he entered the room and closed the
moor behind him the blinds were
drawn throwing the interior into par-
jual darkness the occupant lay on the
ped his unshaven face gaunt against
pie pillows a pair of angry blue
fes glared at mortimer a table

hanking the bed was strewn with medi-
cine-bottles incongruous among them
lay a pack of cards

  mr lowrey asked mortimer
though he had no doubt of the others
identity

  i m lowrey said the sick man
and who the devil are you and what
in blazes d ye mean by butting into my
room 

  my name is mortimer said the
other  sent up my card

   and i sent you word i wouldnt see
you said lowrey angrily i dont
want to see you i dont want to see
anybody its hell enough to be laid
up here by myself but its a heap worse
to be stared at by a damn fool stop
it cant you and get out

  i m sorry lied mortimer the
boy must nave made a mistake he
said youd see me but ac im here
id like to talk a little business  v
feel able

  you go to thunder said lowrey
i wont buy any books and my life
isnt worth insuring i know you fel-
lows if i could stir oil this cursed
bed id jam vou through the fan-
light

  im not selling books nor insur-
ance mortimer protested im not
selling anything i want to buy
want to buy eh  growled the
other if you think ive got anything
worth selling i wish youd hold it next
the light so i can see it myself its
a cinch that id have to go out and steal
anything i sold and look here its
not safe to josh an old prospector even
if he is flat on his back

  im not trying to do anything of
the kind protested mortimer i un-
derstand that you own some silver
oueen stock

   the sick engineer raised himself on
his elbow and eyed hrs interlocutor
closely

  well suppose i do he said at
length is that what you want to

buy 

  i might make you an offer it we
can agree on terms said mortimer
diplomatically

   how do you figure we can agree on


the populzr magazine

terms unless yon make an offer said
the engineer

  vvhat do yon want fur your whole
block of stock inquired mortimer in
his most businesslike tone

  lowrey scrutinized him in silence
then 

  did farrel send you to buy me
out he asked

  farrel repeated mortimer mysti-
fied

  thats what  said farrel

  mortimer had never heard of far-
rel and was on the point of saying so
when it occurred to him that it might
be as well to assume a knowledge he
did not possess

  xo farrel has nothing to do with
it he replied im here for myself
and for no one else im buying for
myself if i buy at all

  how much stock do you figure i
have asked lowrey

  about one hundred thousand
shares

  well and if you buy a hundred
thousand what good is that going to do
you  the mine has been run rotten
since parrels had it and now they tell
me the vein lias pinched out may be
only a fracture but anyway theyve lost
it you must have some reason for
wanting to buy outside of the present
value of the stock and i want to know
what it is ive been away for months
and im not giving up anything in the
dark you say youre not from farrel
and that goes i wouldnt sell him a
share ofmv sock after the way he and
his crowd have treated me all the
same youve got to show me ive been
a sucker often enough

  what do you want to know asked
mortimer i ask you to set a figure
on your stock what does it matter
why r want it

   i tell you im not letting go blind
said the engineer i never thought the
silver queen was a world-beater but
ive spent a heap of time and some
money on it and my shares are all ive
got to show i know what theyre
worth on the market-about a winters
grub-stake and no more thats why
when you come to buy them i start

asking questions because you dont look
like a man that would play a dead card
across the board

  not if i knew it said mortimer
pleased at the others estimate of his
shrewdness and repented the words im-
mediately but of course he added

a man has to take chances now and
then pin willing to take one with
thee shares  think i can handle them
and make a fair profit if you dont
want too much

  not good enough said lowrey
shaking his head  dont ask you to
let me in on the cellar or even the
basement but i want a peep at the
ground floor or we cant deal thats
whatever and its a safe bet that
sick and all as i am and so poor that if
turkeys were a cent a pound i couldnt 
look pleasant at a jaybird i cant be j
talked into a fool sale youll have 
to unbosom some more

  mortimer thought rapidly he had i
no doubt that lowrey meant every
word he said and it was up to him j
to construct an impromptu yarn that 
should contain a fair element of proba- 
bilily and sound plausible thus up 
against it his conversations with col- 
lingwood recurred to him

  well he said ive no objection i
to giving you a look in heres how 
it is your friend farrel and some l
more have a plan to amalgamate with
another company and any one who
wont come in will be frozen out r
those who do come in will find so 
much water in the new stock which j
will be offered them in exchange for j
the old that theyll be disjpisted and j
bc-idcs the new stock will likely be as-
sessahlc thats parrels scheme now j
some other capitalists and myself want 
sufficient stock to block it because weji
think we can sell the mine at a profit j
we are willing to pay a good price asj
compared with the market thats the
whole thing

  sounds all right said lowrey 
how would it be if i came in witlrl
you and agreed to vote my stock any
way voti wished

  it wouldnt do said mortimefif
promptly we are a syndicate anmj
the come-on



we want the absolute control among
ourselves

   so that its freeze-out anyway said
lowrey bitterly tf i dont sell i
get amalgamated and assessed out of
my holdings i know how that works
ive seen it done before and its just
plain robbery but legal as hell and if
i do sell you give me a few cents a
share nice isnt it

   oh ill give you a fair price said
mortimer his heart was beating rap-
idly for he saw signs of yielding lie
plumed himself on the adroitness of
his invention you know that silver
oneen is unsalable at present but ill
give you ten cents a share thars ten
thousand dollars not so bad after
all

  it wouldnt be if you could get it
for that but you canf said lowrey

  how much do you want then
asked mortimer

  lowrey considered

  i should think thirty cents a share
would be about right

  thirty cents exclaimed mortimer
why man alive your stock wouldnt
sell on the market for five

   im not selling it there retorted the
sick engineer you want it pretty
bad or you wouldnt be here im not
letting it go for ten cents anyway

  after half an hour of bargaining
mortimer had raised his offer to fifteen
cents and lowrey had lowered his de-
mands to twenty-five there they
stuck a deadlock appeared imminent
mortimer wondered if after all the
other had heard from the silver queen
man

  i cant do it said the sick engi-
neer look here-he drew a photo-
graph from under his pillow and held
it up to mortimer-theres my wife
and the kids this stock is about all-
have in the world im crippled with
rheumatism nd god knows what be-
sides the altitudes have got my heart
so i m no good any more sooner than
let my stock go at fifteen ill keep it and
aje a chance or ill sell out to farrel
theres something doing and i believe
it will pay me to hang onto it anyway

   mortimer was alarmed he had hun-
at an offer of fifteen as if it had been
his maximum but he did not wish to
arouse the latent obstinacy which he
was sure lowrey possessed in plenty
and besides at any moment that letter
might be delivered if it had not been
delivered already or an agent of casi-
mirs might appear on the scene in
either case it would be good-by to his
chances it behooved him to close the
bargain at once if it took his last cent

   i ll tell you what ill do lowrey
he said with an air of generosity ill
give twenty cents its more than the
stock is worth and i only do it because
you seem to be in hard luck if you re-
fuse that im through

   he waited for a reply his heart in
his mouth the sick engineer looked
long at the photograph of his family
and his chest rose and fell with some
inward emotion

   ill take your offer he said be-
cause i have to id like to keep the
stock if it wasnt for the wife- and the
kiddies its hell being poor-when
youve got a family not married are
you 

  no admitted mortimer thinking
of maisie

   then if you did happen to lose your
money it wouldnt worry you much
said lowrey with a grim smile not
that there seems to be much chance of
your losing it you can look after your-
self i guess take a pretty smart man
to skin you eh but you want to look
out for farrel hes crooked

   ill look out for him said morti-
mer now have you got those certifi-
cates 

  luckily lowrey had them he had
intended to negotiate a loan with them
or to endeavor to do so but his sick-
ness had prevented it the certificates
were apparently in order the sick engi-
neer signed the transfers and mortimer
counted out crisp hundred-dollar bills
the transfer duly completed the latter
consulted his watch and found that he
had just time to catch a train for-ga-
lena he shook hands with lowrey
hurriedly wished him a speedy return
to health and made for the station


the ppulzjr magazine

  mortimer had barely left the room
when the sick engineer leaped from the
bed with surprising agility and pressed
the button  lie bell-boy who responded
passed mortimer on the way

  son said the engineer do you
want to earn real money

  you bet said the boy emphatical-
ly lie had found lowrey a generous
tipper

  then rustic out and spot the man
who has just left here his name is
mortimer and he came in last night
hell be paying bis bill now find out
where he goes and if he leaves town

f they kick at the desk say you had a
note for him from me ill fix it with
them now hump yourself

  tor half an hour he lay quietly in
bed fingering the sheaf of bank-bills
at the end of that time the bell-boy
returned

  the guy left on sixty-four goin
west he said i see him get on the

train

  the sick engineer handed him a
twenty-dollar bill

  thats for you bring me up a bot-
tle of champagne and half a dozen
four-bit cigars as quick as you can step
and rush this message over the wire

  he was shaved and half dressed
when the wine arrived and humming a
tune when the east-bound pulled out
of coppercliffe a couple of hours later
mr william j lowrey the sick engi-
neer spry as a boy was subsidizing
the porter with a view to securing his
best services in the matter of stateroom
accommodation

ix

  mortimer stepped off the train at
galena city with the air of a con-
queror he had one hundred thousand
shares of silver queen safely tucked
in his inside pocket and as these
shares had been purchased at twenty
cents and were as good as sold at fifty
they represented a profit of thirty thou-
sand dollars it was almost incredible
brt he had the written promise of
colonel jefferson casimir capitalist to
pay fifty cents per share this he re-

flected was the way fortunes were
made instead of drudging along on
a salary and investing his money in
farm mortgages at a beggarly five per
cent he had struck boldly for the west
and jumped into the game with the re-
sult that he had made more money in a
fortnight than the staid business men
of ardendale had made in their lives
small wonder that he trodon air as he
made his way to the palate

   he inquired for cullingwood hav-
ing turned the trick he wished to tell
somelxxjy alout it and he had antici-
pated pleasurably that gentleman s sur-
prise and secretly envious congratula-
tions

   mr collingwood left this after-
noon he was told

  mortimer was surprised colling-
wood had said he would be about ga-
lena for a month at least

   do you know which way he went
he asked did he leave any message
for me

   there was no message and no in for- 
mation not having any one to share j
his triumph mortimer dined lone son cl y j
albeit as expensively as possible lie j
would have liked some form of celebra- j
tion but failing that lie devoted an hour i
after dinner to a letter to maisie 
lacking a present friend to listen he r
spread the tale of his success over many j
sheets of paper with much detail and j
then leaving the letter unfinished he j
went to find colonel casimir

  mortimer looked through the
crowded rotunda of the commercial jj
bin nowhere could he see the broad i
shoulders soft black hat and benevo- f
lent face of the capitalist

   out somewhere he soliloquized 
and asked at the desk

   colonel casimir left to-dav was ii
the reply

   mortimers face expressed his con-
sternation but he reflected that the
colonel had a perfect right to leave ga-
lena only it was peculiar that he had
not men i toned the possibility

   any letter for me he asked my
name is mortimer

 nothing	 

   mortimer sat down it came to him
the come-on



  suddenly that he did not know the
  colonels business address or a thing
  about him other than the information he
  had received from collingwood nor
  did he know a thing about collingwood
  beyond what he had been told by the
  colonel a glance at the register
  showed that the latter had registered
  from louisville it so happened that
  mortimer knew a man there and to
  him he wired asking for information
  as to the business standing of colonel
  casimir meantime he made such in-
  quiries as he could but ascertained
  nothing

   he could not receive an answer to
 his telegram before morning and he
i spent the night the prey of a hundred
 horrible doubts he read over his let-
i ter to maisie the cheerfully light
j phrases seemed to mock him his ap-
l predation of his own boldness and
i business sagacity in seizing a situation
l and using it in such a way as to more
f than double his money seemed ghastly
 in its folly and in the morning a
i wire from louisville appeared to con-
 firm his apprehensions it read

    casitnir unknown here in financial circles

mortimer at his wits end spent the
i morning hoping against hope for a tele-
i gram from either collingwood or casi-
f mir in the afternoon it occurred to
him for the first time to make inquiries
 about the silver oueen company he
discovered that they had offices and
thither he repaired although he was
j sure that his sale to casimir had fallen
through he had share-certificates in the
company and they might be of some
 value

the silver queen offices were lo-
cated in a back room of a newly erected
 office-building and were apparently
 shared by several real estate and insur-

	ance men a man sitting with his feet
  on a desk smoking and reading a

 paper was pointed out to him as far-
  rel the president and managing di-
  rector of the stiver queen he greeted
  mortimer with slight ceremony

   i have some shares in the mine and

	id like some information about it
  said the latter

     ou re plumb welcome to informa-
tion said farrel i dont remem-
ber your name as a stockholder

  ivejust bought the shares said
mortimer

  hope you got em cheap then re-
turned farrel grimly  if you want
any more ive a bunch to sell at bar-
gain prices

  what are they worth asked mor-
timer with a sinking heart

   farrel spat accurately into a waste-
basket

  by the square foot he replied
theyll come cheapern burlap theyd
make an artistic thing in wall-paper

  you dont mean to say theyre
worthless cried mortimer  was
told there was a new strike

  the men struck-and theyre not
paid yet said farrel calmly heres
the whole thing in a nutshell the sil-
ver queen may be a good quarry but
it ain t a mine there was ore once
but it has pinched out the company
is busted and high and dry some of
us who were foots enough to sign notes
to the bank for capital to develop with
are being sued on em now the silver
queen is dead horse-wolf bait-all
same the flowers of yesteryear if
youve bought any lithographs im sorry
for you

  mortimer drew out his bundle of
certificates

  i-ive a hundred thousand he
said in a choking voice tor after all he
was very young and i paid twenty
cents a share

   farrel spread out the certificates and
looked at the signatures at first care-
lessly and then with attention he
whistled

   this isnt old bill lowreys signa-
ture he said and after a moments

charles anson collingwood and colonel

formality inside sat mr williairt j
lowrey the sick engineer deeply en-
grossed in a game of solitaire he
looked up as they entered

  well by thunder red cloud al-

we were within an hour of it

  i got your wire said collingwood
lid you land the money frank

  you bet i did said lowrey other-
wise frank duprau mechanic lithog-

cold cash

spread her out said collingwood

  duprau produced a thick bundle of
bilu

  even twenty thousand less some
expenses he announced

  collingwood counted the money with
trained fingers then he divided it into
three portions one of these he shoved
in his pocket

  i had the right- hunch stopping off
at galena he said did he give up
easy

  hypnotized replied duprau
where does he come from lets go
there there may be more like him at
home

  you got his whole stack then said
casimir -s big jim mcdonough
he was well but unfavorably known to

the police of two continents his
come-on operations had extended
over thirty years and the older he
grew the smoother he got he had shed
his soft southern accent as he would

he could have acted to perfection the

india or any one of a dozen rol-s

  charlie can smell a sucker in the

a best offer of fifteen cents a share
then i flashed a picture of my wife
and kids on him and swore i wouldnt
let go under twenty lie gave it to
me claiming it was because i was in
hard luck wouldnt that jar you- and
him thinking he was skinning me thirty
cents a share tliats your honest guy

  where did you get the picture  j
asked mcdonough

  in a photo gallery type of

   at the end of half an hour he looked
at the others mcdonough was smo-

was staring absently out of the window
into the blackness of the night du-

regret

   charlie has got a skirt back east

                 perhaps in these days the scales of justice weigh only money
                 perhaps sometimes truth and sentiment tip them this way or

a complete story

hen i say i just hap-
pened to light on it i
mean it just that way
i was headed for a
spot where i thought i
could fix me up a
hang-out that would
do till i found some-
j thing better because i didnt feel no-
way safe in my present abode after
goodyear being there of course now
j i look back at things hed have had
 quite a large-sized contract leading a
 posse to my cave even if he had want-
 ed to because i packed him in during
i a blizzard and when he was too near
 done up to know where he was half
j the time and  packed him out again
i after dark and in a snow-storm and

even in daylight it wasnt any picnic
finding the place if you was green to
the country especial

but after id got him out of there i
felt like a she-wolf that smells human
tracks close to her den of pups rain
or shine day or night shes going to
vacate that den if she lives maybe
j the man never got next to the place
lbit that dont make any difference to
j her-she holds to the theory that its
better to be safe than sorry and that
was how i felt about it so i was
hiking across he head of a coulee close
 to the one id been stopping in tliink-
mg that on the other side was an over-
hang of roek about like the one id

       

fixed up before and as i said i hap-
pened to light on this other place the
way it was i fell through the earth and
lit in a kinda tunnel made by water
washing underneath

  i wasnt hurt much just shook up
and surprised a lot id dropped about
ten or twelve feet and when id picked
myself up and took stock of my bones
i seen i couldnt expect to go back the
way id come so i started to find the
end of the blamed thing-and which
end didnt matter none to me it was
plumb dark for a ways and i was
headed down-hill so emphatic i had to
lean back and dig in with my heels in
places some folks mightve thought
they was headed straight down to the
hot springs but id been near the top
of a hill when i fell through and i
didnt lose my bearings going down i
judged i was headed for the coulee-
or canon it was particular-that id
been trying to get around so i kept
right on going and didnt worry a lot
about the wind-up

  pretty soon the tunnel give a twist-
where the water had followed the loose
rock and earth-and i seen daylight
ahead all right and then i come out
into a clean level rock hollow that
looked good to me all right for a hide-
out i went to the opening and i was
about half-way down in the canon and
the walls so steep a jack-rabbit couldnt
get up em only for the spring floods
he popular magazine

that would come roaring down through
the tunnel and wash a fellow plumb
out  could have lived there indefinite
and serene with posses hunting through
ihe bad lands with drag-nets

  i set down on a rock and looked
around me and sized up the lay on
one side a spring dripped a little stream
down over the rock wall and landed
in a hollow the size of a dish-pan run
over the top and trickled off through
a seam to the bottom uf the canon-
or the center of the earth it didnt
matter which there was the water
right handy for cooking and that was
all  needed there was other hollows
in the rock floor but they was dry
mostly

  well it all looked good to me and
by the time id smoked a cigarette over
it i could fair see porky and me en-
joying all the comforts of home in
there the tunnel leading into the cave
was small enough so a blanket would
shut off the draft and i could point
the stovepipe into the tunnel to carry
off the smoke and fix up a blanket
door over the opening and-oh i sure
had it all arranged fine inside ten min-
utes

  then i goes back up the tunnel past
the place where id fell through to the
head of the hole it opened out in the
middle of a bunch of rocks secluded
as sin i dont know as i ever run
onto such a peach of a place it was
about half a mile across a level bench
to my other canon and i made long
steps for home and you can gamble on
it his was just after daylight and
i was all packed up and ready to move
before that i was plumb uneasy till
id got out of my old camp and into
the new and soon as id got back from
taking goodyear out i had overhauled
all my stuff and packed things best 
could for cav carrying

  so when i l got porky and me some
bread to stay otir appetites i loaded
up and went and dropped the tuff
down that hole where id fell through
it was snowing and blowing so i didnt
leave no tracks either when id got
everything dropped into the tunnel that
would drop and had let breakables

down with a rope i dropped in myself
and took porky with me and after
that it was pickings and t could get
settled and take my time about it and
they could ride the high-lines all they
blamed please looking for me theres
no use talking-when youve got a
bounty on your scalp and you know
there aint a man in the country but
would be tickled to death to cash you
in you get to feeling a lot better holed
up underground like a wolf and the
deeper you burrow the better you feel
in your mind

  so thafs how me and porky moved
and settled inside twenty-four hours i
after goodyear hail gone and it did j
break up the monotony of holding forth 
in the bad lands in the winter all
right and seeing we had a dandy place j
to stay i was kinda glad we moved

  after that we lived in peace and quiet j
all through january and february and
the time didnt go as slow as you might t
think i hunted quite a lot and kept jj
in freh meat that way which helped 
out on the bacon and beans and was i
fun besides and i had to go up on 
the side hills for firewood and pack it j
down the tunnel and that was some 
considerable work too porky used j
to gnaw the bark off all the stuff that j
had bark so i made it a point to pack j
in some green wood for him it amused i
him a lot and was healthy too

  so there we would be warm and ji
snug no matter how bad the blizzards j
tore things up on top i could see j
where the wolves is in the right about 
making their home underground ive
wintered in line-camps that wasnt near
as comfortable and was blamed near 
as lonesome too most i missed was i
a good horse or two and a saddle i 
dont reckon id used my legs so con-m
stant before since i was a kid and it 
kinda went against me till i got used i
to it

  so now im coming to the real funnyft
part you can maybe imagine me laying
on my blankets with a candle so close
to my head its liable to singe my hair
if i move inadvertent and with old bill
shakespeare in both fits and a ciga-
rette in my teeth kinda half smokingjj
jack bellamy lawbreaker



and half dozing and half watching
porky digging into one of the loose
hollows in our- floor he was busy as
a coon-which i mean the four-legged
brand-and looked important as sin
hed buried something in there and
was trying to get it out and his quills
was rising and falling along with his
interest in the work i thought a lot
of porky by that time and he was a
heap of company for me

  so i watched him som amused till
hed got the hole just about empty and
was dirt all over his face and hands
and it kinda bore in on me that ther
was something funny about his looks
at first i didnt take much interest i
just noticed indifferent that his face
kinda had a shine like these paper
angels they hang on christmas trees
pretty soon i come alive enough to
wonder why and once i got to won-
dering i got interested as sin and took
the candle and went over to him to see
how about it

  i set the candle down on the floor
and looked around and say i like to
have had a fit right there porkv was
just wallowing in gold dust and nug-
gets some of em big as the end of my
thumb now what do you think of
that and me living right there for
two months or so and never tumbling
to what was laying around careless
within reach wasnt it plumb scan-
dalous 

  i guess i dont have to describe par-
ticular what took place there the next
three or four days you can shut your
eyes and see one jack bellamy mostly
on his hands and knees scooping out
every blamed hollow he can locate and
whooping like a drunken sheep-herder
at porky over the results say ive
read about such things but i never took
stock in any real live man striking luck
n heaps and chunks that way part
of the time i couldnt help thinking
the solitude had kinda gone to my head
and turned me silly so i was imagining
that every hollow in that cave was alive
with gold

  times like that id hike up the tun-
nel with my rifle on my shoulder and
porky at my heels like a dog and go

off over the hills hunting deer gen-
erally when i seen i could shoot same
as ever and bring down whatever 
took aim at just like i always had done
id be some reassured in my mind and
would go back and find the gold right
there where id left it and then id
get to guessing about how much there
was of it and thinking of all the things
it would do-properly applied no use
talking gold is a mighty nice thing to
have around with a quart of dust and
a handful of nuggets a man can keep
himself interested a mighty jong while
planning out the things hes going to
do with it-and i had several quarts
of dust and nuggets till they was that
heavy it give me the blamedest queer
tingling feeling all over me when i
lifted em just thinking how it was all
gold and all mine you dont know
how crimply you get over it till youve
swelled your biceps out lifting your
own gold and it was sure mine all
right-mine and porkys nobody
hadnt tore the bone out digging that
stuff and then lost it old mother na-
ture had just naturally left it laying
in the ground careless and the spring
floods that had washed out that tunnel
and cave had sluiced it thorough and
washed it down so it caught in the hol-
lows of the rock and stayed there no
telling how many hundred years it had
took-but its safe to say it was
longer than itll take me to get away
with it

  i guess it must have took me a week
or so to get gentled down so i could
view the situation anyways calm at all
and think deliberate about me being
rich  rich enough to buy out the best
stock-ranch in the county i reckon
and then have some left so t didn t
read no more after that but put in the
time deciding how i could have the
most enjoyment in the shortest space of
time

  right there is where i bumped into a
problem that kinda feazed me at first
id build me up a dream that was sure
a peach and then it would occur to me
that i couldnt bring it to pass none
because i was an outlaw with a price
on mv head and soon as i showed up


the popular magazine

anywheres theyd slap me in jail and
if i was so unwise as to tell about my
find theyd likely swipe it whilst 
walked to my meals with my hands on
another fellows shoulder too blamed
intimate to be pleasant

  what do you think of that  me
cached down there in the bad bands
with more gold than id seen in all my
life or ever expected to and languish-
ing after a soft bed and feather pillows
and clothes built for me cspecial and
not in job lots and all the things a
healthy man likes and wants-and not
daring to walk up to any man in day-
light for fear hed do me some under-
handed trick that would put me all to
the bad

   justice the name of it fair made me
 sick and then i got to thinking over
 again how i didnt deserve no such a
 deal as id been getting hadnt killed
 anybody or robbed no bank or train or
 nothing like that all under heaven i
 could see that i was guilty of was ob-
 jecting a lot to being close-herded in
 jail and busting out when they locked
 me up for not doing anything why a
 man is a plumb fool to stay in jail
 when he aint done anything mean and
 can get out  and it wasnt my fault
 that the bars in their blamed window
 was set in rotten mortar was it i
 didnt mix that mortar

   so there i was with gold enough to
get out and have a fine large time and
yet held up by that weird reputation
id got innocent and inadvertent at
first it had looked to me like a big josh
-this being an outlaw without deliver-
ing the goods-but id got all over
that  i couldnt see none where the
laugh come in and i was plumb ready
to take it serious

   one night i was setting there in the
 candle-light with the nuggets spread
 out on a blanket studying how i could
 get clean out of the country without
 being grounded up and any way i
 looked at it that rep of mine loomed up
 large in tlie trail and then i just
 thought to myself that seeing i hadnt
 done nothing so fierce i didnt see how
 they could do me any great damage if i
 just fought it to a finish

  the scales of justice i says to
myself is used mostly nowadays for
weighing gold-and ive got the gold
if  cant tip the scales my way with
both gold and right on my side what
the dickens is justice and laws and law-
yers for anyhow im going to amble
right in and face plummer and the rep
he give me and make em put up or
shut up this thing of packing a bad
name is getting pretty blamed monoto-
nous especial when i havent got it
coming

  so after that heart-to-heart talk with
myself i felt a heap better and went to
sleep peaceful as anything next morn-
ing i commenced to get ready for the
move i was going to make it was like
staking my whole pile of chips on one
draw but i felt good all the same my
packing up didnt take long except
that i had to cache my wealth safe till
i coui  come back and get it like the
fellow in monte cristo do you know
i couldnt help kinda wondering if id
pan out the same and have to tell a
side-pardner where to find it and let
him wear the diamonds whilst i gazed
down from paradise on the swath he
was cutting with my gold i tell you
right now that prospect didnt please
me none to speak of

  anyway i took all t could with me
and made me tip some venison sand-
wiches so i wouldnt have to cook none
on the road i meant to do a stunt of
walking that would make my grand-
children set up when i told em about
it-in case i ever accumulated any-
and cover the seventy or eighty miles
to the county-seat-which i aint na-
ming-just as quick as the lord would
let me

  i didnt want to be took in you un-
derstand  i wanted to go in and snub
them gay sheriffs and truck up short
and ask em how about it and with-
out wasting no words i can say that i
got out of the bad lands without ma-
king no disturbance amongst the na-
tives

  second day out i run onto a little
place where an old fellow happened to
bf holding her down alone and build-
ing him up a ranch and a little bunch
jack bellamy lawbreaker



of horses he hadnt been out of there
for six months he tokl me so i felt tol-
erable safe and eat dinner with him
he wasnt worrying none about jade
bellamy he was all for discoursing on
why the united states paid spain
twenty million dollars for the philip-
pines-which was interesting enough
at the time maybe so but what you
might call stale news at present he
got real excited over it though and
come up and shook his finger under my
nose every time he turned loose a
bunch of eloquence and when we was
eating he like to have jabbed my eyes
out once or twice with his fork he
was sure an earnest-minded old cuss
and when i offered to buy a horse and
riiling-outfit from him after dinner he
was still worried a lot over them twen-
ty millions and how they ought to been
spent so he wasnt none curious and
sold me his saddle and bridle and a
horse like he was handing me the ma-
terials for a cigarette he didnt even
come alive enough to haggle none on
the price but stuck the money down
in his jeans absent-minded with one
hand whilst he made gestures with the
other and libelized the republican
party something fierce he wanted me
to stay all night but i was in a hurry
and rode off hasty the last thing i
heard was i tell ye mark han-
na- the wind blowed the rest

away and j wasnt none grieved be-
cause i had things on my mind a heap
more important

  i tell you right now i felt like a
king once i got a decent horse between
my knees again and more optimistic
than id been since away back theres
no use talking a cow-puikfher aint all
there when you take his horse away
from him and set him on his own legs
i know i meditated a lot on how i
come to be such a fool as to let them
idiots buffalo me into hiding out all
this while looked to me like t should
have called em long ago and then i
got to whistling and seeing my horse
was a stayer as well as a drifter we
hit that little old county-seat along
about sundown stepping high wide
and handsome and me with my hat

on the back of my head and elbows
flopping gay-and-free-and-dont-give-a-
damn

  i galloped right down the middle of
their main thoroughfare and come near
running over a dog-fight swung round
in a beautiful curve bounded on all
sides and the middle with yellow dust
and pulled up and made me a cigarette
whilst i listened to the owner of one
dog tongue-lash the owner of die other
dog and tell how easy it would be to
lick him to a frazzle and what a pleas-
ure it would be if he just only had time
to waste on him he mourned too be-
cause he couldnt see his way clear to
throwing away good lead on him and
the like of that and it all seemed like
old times come back when  was just
a common ordinary bronco-twister and
cow-puncher and wasnt figuring none
in the public eye as the real thing in
outlaws

  so pretty soon when the excitement
kinda died down and the dogs had gone
off to diagnose what wounds they
hadnt accumulated i asked one fel-
low if plummer was in town-which
was the deputy sheriff that had caused
all my woe you remember the man
said he was and what did i want him
for especial because he was over in
the ten-strike just peeling a sheepman
in great thick layers in a poker-game
and he wouldnt want to be disturbed
for trifles

  i didnt want to make myself none
of a bad man and a boaster but i was
feeling good and sassy go in and
tell him jack bellamy is out here and
would like a whole lot to see him a
minute say the fellow like to have
went over backward but he just give
me one good look and packed my
message in to plummer and i set
out there  my horse and made me
another smoke and nobody done a
thing but rubber  hey was as meek
a bunch as i ever met up with and it
sure did amuse me seeing i was in the
joke and knew how plumb harmless i
was really

  plummer come out all right sure
he did  he come with two guns point-
ed ahead of him and gazabos peering


the popular magazine

over his shoulder furtive ready to
dodge back just as quick as the fire-
works commenced i kept right on
smoking with one leg hooked over the
saddle-horn and my hat back i will
admit i was playing a watch-me-hoys
game but seems like them months i
put in by my high lonesome in the
bad lands had to have something to
balance em and so i was dead willing
to create a sensation and have some fun
out of the deal if there was any up
to then the fun had been as scarce as
meadow-larks in winter when plum-
mer was about twenty feet off he
stopped and eyed me watchful

  t heard you was plumb anxious to
see me mr plummer  says to him
pleasant so i just thought id ride

around and-- i stuck there for the

simple reason that the fun oozed out
of the situation as yuh might say and
lft me mad clear through at the way
hed acted up and give me the worst
of it all along if id been the kind of
man hed got me painted id sure have
ventilated him up some right there
he was one of these big red-faced
bull-necked marks that you just hate
the sight of on general principles i
couldnt to save my life go on making
a show i got too blamed serious for
ever thinking any more about the gen-
eral effect t was having on the audi-
ence

  plummer come a little closer scowl-
ing something fierce jack bellamy
youre my prisoner he bawls out in-
sulting

  oh am i i asks him through my
teeth-and then i turned loose and told
him all the things id been saying to
myself this long while whenever he
come up as a subject for my thoughts
to dwell on murderous i dont know
all t did say and anyway  guess the
biggest share wouldnt stand repeating
in mixed company lint  remember
fine how i wound up

  you made yourself mighty busy till
you got me branded for a sure-enough
outlaw i says with a bounty on my
scalp like t was a wolf and now im
here to call your bluff im here to
make you prove all them things

youve chalked up the account to phase
yourself so far but right here and now

youve got to prove the items you
couldnt bring me into camp yourself
you-well just as well skip like
everything along about here-so i
had to come in myself you neednt
get scared for fear ill pull out-im
going to stop right here and fight you
in the court youve got backing your
play lead the way down to that imi-
tation jail youve got here im going
to stop there to-night-which i knew
fine id just about nave to and wouldnt
give him a chance to haze me into it-
and t wish you fellows would round
up all the lawyer sharps youve got in
this burg and send em down to me
 size em up and take my pick i
waved my hand grand-and there was
a gun in it so plummer led the way
like a little man and if you ask me
why when he had them two guns in
plain view ill never tell you  know
he didnt keep em pointing at me none
too straight whilst i was making my
war-talk and that give me a chance
to pull mine and i guess my doing
the unexpected kinda feazed him and
got him rattled anyway he led out
all right and i followed with just
about the whole town at my heels like i
was a circus parade

  i went into the jail behind plummer
and told the jailer to put me down for
the best room he had and to serve
supper immediate because i was hun-
gry as sin and do you know they
was that hypnotized with seeing me
there giving orders about my own in-
carceration that they done just about
as they was told and didnt have noth-
ing much to say which was sure
lucky for i wouldve looked plumb
foolish if theyd forced my hand and
me not wanting to do nothing fierce

  i was setting on a corner of the table
in tiie jail office smoking a cigarette
and telling the gang what a lot of good
things i didnt think of em and they
listening attentive like  was a fourth
of july orator shipped in from the next
countv when in squirms a couple of
fellows that looked like they thought it
was their game i sized em up out
jack bellamy lawbreaker



of the tail of my eye and went on
and finished what i had to say and
then one steps up and asks me if im
jack bellamy

  t sure am old-timer  answers po-
lite if you dont believe me just
cast your eagle optics over the deputy
sheriff and be convinced dont he look
a lot like he was expecting to be rolled
dovvn-hill again

  he glanced over to plummer and i
seen by a twinkle in his eyes that he
had some sense of humor in him which
pleased me a lot what i was dreading
most was to have them that had au-
thority take me serious i wanted to
put the joke on plummer and keep it
there which would ease things up for
me considerable

  you wont have plummer to deal
with now he remarks eying me keen
im the sheriff and i place you under
arrest

  oh joy i exclaims ive been
wanting fierce to meet up with you
mr sheriff i always like to make my
deal with the main guy if youll chase
all these rooters out of here id like
to have a little heart-to-heart talk with
you

  they stay he asserts swallowing
a grin i dont want to be accused
of grafting on the quiet say on-and
remember it will be used against you

  will it  i took two or three draws
of smoke and looked him over i
hope it wont be the means of hanging
me-but i wanted to ask for an imme-
diate preliminary hearing so i can give
bonds they tell me they dont have
felt mattresses nor real linen sheets in
this hotel and im a heap fastidious
and object a lot to the accommodations
also it insults both my muscles and
mv drains to expect me to stay locked
in a place thats so easy broke out of
if i should happen to get to dreaming
in the night td likely walk off and
lose myself im sure a terror to sleep-
walk so if youll round up a judge
of some kind id be much obliged and
vote for vou next time vou run for
office

   the bonds would likely be high

he warns still looking through me and
back

  ive got a right to have em
named i answers and got up and
yawned if i cant produce the goods
thats my own funeral and you neednt
even be one of the mourners old-timer
get busy

  well i like your nerve he con-
cedes and sets plummer to telephoning
whilst he kept an eye on me he
wasnt taking no chances-that sheriff
wasnt and i respected him for it

  pretty soon we was bunched up in
the office of a justice of the peace and
he was saying two thousand dollars
like he thought id wilt right there i
hadnt give em an opening to search
me you see so when i rolled out my
nuggets on the desk and called for
scales to weigh em their eyes stood
out like frogs and they crowded up
till i was humped over the desk and
couldnt straighten up for a minute till
id rammed my elbows into their chests
a few times

  the fellow that had come into the
jail with the sheriff was a lawyer and
lie looked to me medium honest con-
sidering his trade so i handed him
the nuggets casual for a retaining fee
and told him to hunt me up a bonds-
man or two and watch my interests in
the game and see that they didnt ring
in any cold deck on me or anything
like that so he said he would and
took me under his wing right there

  for the week that went by before
my case came up in district court that
happened to be setting then i was kept
pretty tolerable busy wondering wheth-
er i was a hero or a curiosity to that
town i always had a crowd trailing
after me when i walked the street
and in every saloon they bunched
around me like i was a salvation army
on a street-corner my lawyer--he
was named charley oberlv and was an
all-right boy-told me not to tell all i
knew but to leave some of it for him
to say in court so i took the hint and
didnt loosen up none on my weird and
bloody career nor how i come to be
getting humpback carrying gold nug-
gets around nor anything about it i


the popular magazine

did guy plummer some though be-
cause it was against ihe rules to kill
him off and i had to relieve my mind
some way whenever our trails crossed
which he took care didnt happen none
frequent after the first time or two

  so then when my case come up and
i went in with charley to face the jury
and take whatever medicine they mixed
for me the court-room looked like a
prize-fight was about to be called the
audience was that eager and piled
three-deep seemed like and i got a
jolt too i hadnt paid no attention
to details but left it all to oberly be-
cause i was paying him good and want-
ed to make him earn his money and
i was busy untangling myself from my
admirers all the time so the man
that was to build up the case against
me id plumb overlooked and hadnt
thought nothing about and here he
was goodyear goodyear the man id
packed on my back in a blizzard and
took him to my cave and nursed him
and fed him and rubbed him faithful
with three-h and hair-restorer and
lent him bill shakespeare to read-oh
thunder

  i was going to shake hands with
him but he eyed me cold and i got
hostile and give him a glare that made
his look caressing by comparison and
set down haughty and told charley they
could turn loose any old time now i
was disappointed as sin in goodyear
because t did think lie was human and
would remember how i could easy have
left him to freeze to death and didnt
but what can you expect of a county
attorney anyhow theyre there for
the sole and simple purpose of hanging
every man they can ancl building up a
large black name for every poor devil
lhat comes into court theyre paid to
do it and they cant do it thorough and
be human so they aint human  its
their trade not lo be

  i will say one thing for goodyear
he sure could talk white into black
it made me think of when t was pack-
ing him through that blizzard and he
was arguing against it so that he made
me feel as if iwas committing a crime
to save his life like that that morn-

ing in court  came near thinking 
had all right

  the way he put the case  was liv-
ing for the sole object of breaking the
laws and doing injury to my fellow
men and i was plumb dangerous to
have around he sure had me painted
lurid he told about me taking a
prisoner away from an officer and
about me breaking jail and then he
went strong on me rolling plummer
down-hill to his train and getting off
on ilelgas snow-shoes and he oiaed
till the crowd didnt know whether chey
ought to shed tears over plumner or
laugh themselves sick over him any-
ways goodyear elocuted v ih a large-
sized weep in his voice

  think of it gentk-n  of the jury
he implorfed piteous our brave dep-
uty sheriff who has served us faith-
fully subjected to such indignity and
made to suffer such mental and bodily
anguish  picture that long snow-cov-
ered bluff lhat slope vhere all was
white and innocent to the eye and yet
where this hack-hearted scoundrel be-
fore you was about to perpetrate an
outrage the like of which civilized man
bad never conceived think of him
gentlemen of the jury driving before
him up that hill the officer who had
courageously placed him under arrest
think of our deputy sheriff toiling
painfully to the top of that bluff with
this heartless fiend driving him like a-
a-a sheep  picture mr plummer ly-
ing down at the command of his pris-
oner being spurned with the prisoners
boot and sent rolling down down that
awful slope great guns gentlemen
of the jury what if mr plummer had
hit a rock 

  well say i snorted right there and
rocked back and forth in my chair and
fair howled i was that tickled if
theyd hung me next minute i couldnt
have helped it plummer was setting
there red as a turkev-gobblers brow
and when  looked at him i give a
whoop involuntary next i knew every-
body was laughing and howling and
the judge was near getting apoplexy
and the sheriff pounding for silence
and the jury holding onto each other
jack bellamy lawbreaker



such a time i never did see it was
plumb scandalous

  after a while things calmed down so
goodyear could go on he didnt orate
any further but said the state was
ready to present the evidence against
the prisoner and called up plummer
which was cruel to the poor man
seerred like he had to bring out all the
most humiliating details and goodyear
trying his blamedest to make the jury
see it serious whilst the audience
snickered there was anotherwitness
or two folks that had been cr the
train you see goodyear ha i picked
on this one particular crime vo hang
me for and he was trying to spread it
out and make the mrsst or t and the
more he made of it e more ridicu-
lous it showed up plii  ler till by the
time the state rested j felt as if i was
even with plummer and if  had to go
to the pen i could o with a good
grace know-ing that hed be hooted
plumb out of the country for the part
hed played

  when chat ley oberlv got busy he
didnt do a thing to plummer and the
rest oh no and he didnt make
sport of the whole thing or nothing
he told my tale the way id told it to
him and i will say he told it better and
made me see myself a martyr to plum-
mers damn-foolishness then he got
serious and got the jury to looking se-
rious and sorry for me

  then goodyear got up again and
told how fun or no fun the laws of
the country had got to be upheld and
respected and that got me because
is was a fact all right that i had broke
the law all to smithereens when i tack-
led plummer assaulting an officer
aint any joke-not when you come
right dowti to facts i could see the
jury change its mind as plain as you
see a cloud come over the sun and put
you in the shadow goodyear was a
good talker all right in ten minutes
or less i wras feeling small and mean
and couldnt look anybody in the eye
i felt like apologizing to plummer
even  which goes to prove the kind of
talker goodyear was the judges spiel
had been stern and proper and all that

but it didnt begin to get me the way
goodyear done  hen goodyear wound
up the queerest ever

  he  sot the jury so they had
guill  in big letters hanging on the
ends of their tongues when he broke
off short and waited a minute till every-
body got to wondering- what was going
to happen then he commenced some-
thing like this

  while it may seem irrelevant and
not bearing on this particular case gen-
tlemen jf the jury i want to tell a
little adventure of mine that happened
this last wiuter you will have ob-
served gentlemen that i limp quite no-
ticeably y ou may also have heard how
i was lost last december and how
searching parties had given me up
when i appeared very mysteriously
one night on the door-step of the store
at claggett i refused at the time you
remember to elucidate i will do so
now

  gentlemen of the jury i was badly
hurt from falling off a high bank that
caved treacherously near the edge i
was separated from my companions
and could not walk i lay for hours
shouting and firing my rifle at inter-
vals to attract the attention of the
others but to no purpose it was near
night and i was chilled through and
hopeless of ever seeing anything be-
yond those high walls when a man
came sliding and scrambling down to
me he was a stranger and i am going
to tell rou what he did he took me
upon his back when he found i could
not walk and he carried me somehow
up that bluff it was storming and
growing bitter cold and i begged him
not to sacrifice himself for me i real-
ized to the full what he was doing-or
no i did not then afterward i knew

  in spite of protests he labored
through the storm making no explana-
tion but toiling up and down that heart-
breaking trail i am not a small man
and how his muscles must have strained
under the load i leave you to imagine
i was faint when at last wre reached
shelter that shelter gentlemen of the
jury was a cave under an overhanging
rock as nearly as i could judge it


the popular magazine

was roughly comfortable and he put
me on his bed and worked over me
like a brother he cooked for me did
all in his p wer to ease my sufferings
and treated me as an honored guest

  why he was living there alone he
did not explain nor did i inquire per-
haps  could have guessed it  had
tried perhaps i could guess that ins
safety and his freedom depended on his
keeping this place secret and that he
was jeopardizing that freedom and
safety when he carried me a stranger
into ins retreat  might possibly have
guessed that he was dividing with me
f that it would he hard for him
to replenish that the medicine he used
on my injuries he might need badly
for himself i might imagine when
lie at last insisted upon taking me on
a sled down to claggett that i might
receive better care than he could give
that he was taking a great risk that
lie was running into a danger he must
certainly have dreaded

  i might have guessed gentlemen of
the jury that the man who did all this
the man who lived down in that god-
forsaken hole alone save for the com-
pany of a pet porcupine the man who
saved my life and risked his own-
more than his own for he risked the
freedom dearer to him than his life i
might have known gentlemen of the
jury that that man was jack bellamy

the prisoner who is waiting now tor

your verdict

  he sat down and nobody said a
blamed thing for as much as a minute
then the foreman of the jury looked
around at the rest and they rose up
and veiled not guilty i till you could
hear em clear into the street

  i dont know why but  got kinda
silly for a minute i couldnt see any-
thing hut blurs and i kept swallowing
at an ache that pinched my throat and
when somebody grabbed my hand 
couldnt for the life of me tell who it
was then i blinked furious and could
see that it was goodyear

  you blamed idiot he was saying
in my ear couldnt you see it was
for your good that i made my case
strong as possible couldnt you sec
it would come out all serene in spite
of hell-and-high-water mows porky
did you bring him with you 

  i gulped a time or two and got my
voice in working trim no i said
i didnt but im going bak after him
and the rest of my gold-mine and if
you and charley oberly want to come
along ill wait till youre through
courting here

  you bet your sweet life i ii come
he grins

  then the crowd like to have buried
me clean out of sight they piled in that
thick to congratulate me

thread used in surgery

are you aware that the modem surgeon employs in his work dozens of dif-
ferent kinds of thread for sewing up cuts and wounds among them are
kangaroo tendons horsehair silk and very fine silver wire many of
tlgese threads are intended to hold for a certain number of days and then natu-
rally break away the short tough tendons taken from the kangaroo which are
used for sewing severe wounds will hold for about four weeks beiore they break
away silk thread will remain much longer sometimes six months while the
fine silver wire is practically indestructible

    with the entire outfit a surgeon is able to select a thread that will last as
long as the wound takes to heal and will then disappear completely to accom-
modate this assortment of threads special varieties of needles are required be-
sides the needle craned in different segments of a circle surgeons use needles
shaped like spears javelins and bayonet points

by j kenilworth eger con
author of queen drag o s cape the perfume of madness  etc

   having landed van octen in jail tomn y williams seems entitled to a
respite from his unsought-for battles with criminals and conspirators there
is no rest lor him however the powerful nand of van osten moves his pup-
pets of crime even from behind the bars ot a sicilian prison and our artist
friend finds himself the object of the unsolicited attention of anarchists the
mafia and what-not secret forces he deals with them in his wonted way

in two parts-part i

ee name ernesto
cambioni which was
printed on his card
conveyed nothing to
us and when he en-
tered the studio which
my friend mr thomas
williams had fitted up
in palermo he looked from one to the
other of us inquiringly

  i have the honor of addressing mr
williams he said interrogatively in
english which scarcely betrayed his
foreign birth tommy nodded and
glanced again at the card

  that is my name what can i do
for you  he asked and the italian
glanced at me and smiledv

  that will perhaps need consider-
able explanation and i assume that i
may speak freely before you both he
answered it would be better if i told
you firt mv position t am an official
of the italian secret service and  am
employed in the international depart-
ment my special duties being to watch
the anarchists and to safeguard the
royal family and such visiting royalty
as come to italy

  but a- neither my friend nor my-
self could by the wildest stretch of the
imagination be classed as members of

that interesting brotherhood i can
hardly believe that you visit us in your
official capacity answered tommy and
the italian laughed and shrugged his
shoulders

  not exactly in an official capacity
and i have never suspected for a mo-
ment that you were either of you in
sympathy with those pests of society
he said after a moments hesitation it
has often fallen within my province to
order the deportation of undesirable
foreigners across the frontier believe
me  do not insinuate that either of
you gentlemen fall within that cate-
gory  for i know a great deal about
you and it is all to your credit but still
i come to recommend to you as a mat-
ter of courtesy that you leave italy at
your very earliest convenience he
had stated such a startling proposition
that i gave an exclamation of surprise
but tommy at whom he looked when
he spoke was entirely unperturbed

  let me understand you perfectly
please he said offering his guest a
cigarette and motioning him to a chair
 you disclaim all official authority in

this 

  yes and no answered cambioni
quietlv i do not speak as an official
but because of information which has


the popuur magazine

come to me in my official capacity let
me put myself right in one thing i
have been much in america watching
the anarchistic group whose headquar-
ters is in that country and as an of-
ficial i have made the acquaintance of
two men in new york who know you
well -mr longley the district attorney
and in-fector clancy of mulberry
street

  and they gave us such a bad repu-
tation that you wish to deport us sug-
gested tommy grinning

  on the contrary they told me
things about you which make me wish
that you might remain here and aid me
in my task which is no easy one re-
plied the italian courteously i regret
extremely lhat  feel obliged to make
the other suggestion

   suppose that you know the reason
that we remain so long in sicily it is
not altogether our own choice said
tommy and cambioni nodded

  in a nutshell you have promised the
local police authorities that you will re-
main to testify at the trial of one van
osten who lies in the palermo prison
under the charge of brigandage he
said i believe that your personal an-
imosity against that man would induce
you to remain here without that
pledge but i can assure yon that you
are wasting your time you w ill never
testify against him the sicilian cus-
toms are peculiar

  i take it that you are not entirely
in sympathy with the local authorities
said tommy dryly they seem to re-
gard our evidence as of the greatest
importance cambioni was silent for
several moments and then looked at
tommy with at least an assumption
of perfect frankness

  mr williams there is nothing to
be gained by beating about the bush
with you and i will explain as much
as i can he said earnestly i landed
in naples yesterday direct from new
york you can imagine what mv du-
ties have been in america for it is
known that the headquarters of the
italian anarchists is there you will
recall that it was there that the assassi-
nation of king humbert was planned

anil that his murderer came directly
from there- of course have my spies
among them and it may interest von ti
know that at a secret meeting held two
weeks ago a certain important action
was voted upon und it was unanimous-
ly voted to delay it until you had been
removed as a precautionary measure

  great scott do they think that im
closely enough associated with royalty
to make my scalp of value exclaimed
tommy incredulously see here mr
cambioni are you trying to string
me the whole story seemed so pre-
posterous that i shared tommys in-
credulity and looked upon cambioni as
a crank but he was undoubtedly in
earnest and he made a gesture of pro-
test

   this is not a thing to be treated
lightly mr williams he said serious-
ly there are always many wheels
within wheels in thie sort of a con-
spiracy as a matter of fact t am still
ignorant of the details of the plot which
they are working out so much so that
i do not know which particular royal
house is threatened but i do know as
a positive fact that your death was de-
creed and that measures were taken to
bring it about

  and will you kindly tell me why a
modest and retiring american artit
should receive attention at their
hands inquired tommy in a tone
which indicated his entire unbelief

  i have no doubt that your own esti-
mate of yourself would hardly be in-
dorsed by all who know you by mr
longley by my confrere of the french
service le garde and a few others
for example answered cambioni smi-
ling through your friendship with
those gentlemen you have been inter-
ested in many things which are outside
of vour profession mr williams you
can see that i am fairly familiar with
much that you have done and i know
that you have been mixed p more or
less-always on the right side of
course - with several conspiracies
which might have materially changed
the face of europe had they succeeded
were i in league with the anarchists j
instead of fighting constantly against
the mafia and the contessa



them  am free to confess that i
should not entirely disregard a man
who had been largely instrumental in
foiling the lifelong scheme of nicholas
lobenski who had aided in laying by
the heels clco de wynt the cleverest
political intriguer in europe and last
but not least the man whom van os-
tena criminal who lias successfully de-
fied the entire continental and english
police fears more than he does all of
the organized forces whose duty it is
to safeguard society from his kind

   tommy is in many ways a very re-
 markable man but he possesses one
 failing which is common in very ordi-
 nary ones and i saw that the detectives
 tribute tickled his vanity it did more
 than that however for while the
 italian had related his incredible story
 about the anarchists he had been
 studying him to read some hidden mo-
 tive and something in cambionis trib-
 ute had apparently afforded him the
 clue

   i saw the old familiar mephistophe-
 lian expression come to his face the
 bright eyes looked sharply at the de-
 tective from between half-closed lids
 and the little cock of his shapely head
 which i knew so well indicated to me
 that he had found what he had been
 searching for

   there is nothing in those past epi-
 sodes which indicates animosity to an-
 archism mr cambioni he said
 thoughtfully i have never mixed up
 great socialistic problems with the in-
 dividual cases in which i have been in-
 terested of course i understand your
 allusions to the sicilian customs and i
 appreciate that it is not healthy to know
 too much when the accused man has in-
 fluential or unscrupulous friends but i
 was always able to keep my skin whole
 when van osten himself was al liberty
 and i think it will be easier when he is
 not personally at the head of affairs
 the italians expressive hands were
 i working nervously whiletommy spoke
  and when he finished he raised them and
  ticked off his facts on his fingers

   you first ran across him in paris a
 few months agoin the matter of the
 theft of mrs mallories jewels i be-

 lieve he said you solved the mys-
 tery surrounding that when the french
 police were on the wrong track that
 led to the pursuit of van osten and
 his capture at the very moment that a
 tremendous fortune was within his
 grasp tommy nodded assent and the
 italian passed to the second finger

  following his escape you became
involved with le garde in the pursuit
of the man with the paw  one of van
ostens most valuable accomplice and
incidentally interfered with another
one of his carefully laid plots to acquire
a large fortune it is more than prob-
able that he would have succeeded but
for you

 and the fortune of war which
seamed to be against him amended
tommy and the detective shrugged his
shoulders and indicated the third fin-
ger which was ornamented with a seal-
ring of curious design and setting

  the fortune of war seems to have
been constantly in your favor he con-
tinued however the result was the
same and van osten lost most de-
cisively and attributes his ill fortune to
you by a curious combination of cir-
cumstances you were again opposed to
him when there was a possibility that
he might make a great winning for it
was owing to your efforts that he was
unable to regain the papers which
would have placed king peter of ser-
via practically at his mercy

  an honor which was thrust upon
me and which i did not desire com-
mented tommy perhaps that expe-
rience was quite as disastrous to me as
to van osten there was a little of
bitterness in his tone and cambioni
glanced at him sharply

  the material loss to him was a great
one he replied that of course is
a closed incident and he realizes that
there is no use in crying over spilt
milk in your fourth contest with him
however-and here a crooked little
finger remained alone in the air- you
yourself were saved almost by a mira-
cle and while you may have planned the
campaign which ended in his capture
the actual glorv of it belonged to an-
other with whom van osten will un-


the popular magazine

doubtcdly reckon in due time of
course your continued presence here
and your persistence in following his
trail caused him considerable uneasi-
ness  but as i have told you it is not
probable that you would ever testify
against him tommy smoked quietly
for a moment watching the blue cig-
arette smoke curl in the air above his
head and then tossing his cigarette
away lie leaned forward and looked
the italian squarely in the eyes

  mr cambioni it might be as well
to omit all of this fanciful imagining
about the american anarchists and get
down to the milk in the coconut he
said dryly it is fair to assume that
you visited van osten before coming
here cambioni nodded entirely un-
abashed

  i have just come from the prison
he admitted

  then i believe it would be simpler
to tell me just the nature of van os-
tens instructions to you omitting all
of the anarchistic embroidery with
which you have ornamented them
said tommy grimly and the italian
smiled and shook his head

  my dear sir i can assure you that
there is no imagination about it he
protested as i told you there are
always wheels within wheels but it is
a cold positive fact that your death
was decreed by the anarchists in
america and i have every reason to be-
lieve that the sentence will be carried
out unless you choose to disappear
leaving all of that out of consideration
you arc living on a powder-magazine
for the climate of sicily is not health-
ful for witnesses for the state

  you are making a bad case for the
administration of justice in italy sug-
gested tommy and cambioni shrugged
his shoulders indifferently

  sicily can hardly be called italy as
we romans understand it he said
in spite of the confederation the de-
partment of justice at the capital has
little control over the administration in
the old kingdom of naples were you
in northern italy i could assure you all
possible protection but in sicily the
conditions are entirely different

  as instanced by the case of nasi
said tommy and i saw that his random
shot had gone home for cambioni
gave an involuntary start and a sus-
picion of red came to his olive cheeks

  you could have no better illustra-
tion of the powerlessness of the cen-
tral authority he answered quickly
that man a sicilian deputy who
filled the cabinet position of minister
of education was impeached and con-
victed on the plainest evidence of the
embezzlement of millions he was sen-
tenced to a long term of imprisonment
but owing to his constitutional im-
munity as a deputy to the italian par-
liament he could not be arrested to
serve it until his term of office expired
he gloried openly in his peculations
but the public opinion of sicily saw
nothing wrong in what he had done
and he is regularly reelected as the dep-
uty for trapani at each election so
that he can laugh in the faces of the
judges who have convicted him it
has made us the laughing-stock of eu-
rope mr williams but it should
serve as a warning to you xo man
would be convicted in sicily if he mur-
dered you to prevent you from testify-
ing for the state your own govern-
ment might make all sorts of demands
and rome would be as powerless to
satisfy them as was washington to
punish the citizens of new orleans
who lynched a dozen of my country-
men

  there will be no occasion for gov-
ernment interference i dont intend to
volunteer as a victim answered tom-
my grinning this thing interests me
as a psy chological study though mr
cambioni if you were a sicilian i
might perhaps understand it more
easily but the fact that you are from
the north and a member of the police
as well makes it difficult for me to
guess why you come to me as an emis-
sary of van osten and tell me this
fantastic tale of anarchism tommys
manner and tone were so contemptuous
that i expected the italian to resent the
speech but he accepted it placidly and
simply shrugged his shoulders

  i again assure you that the warning
the mafia and the contessa



   i give you is genuine and entirely war-
   ranted by the facts be said patiently
   to be perfectly frank i consider the
   ether danger quite as imminent and i
   should hesitate to guarantee your safe-
   ty unless you leave italy at once and
   go into retirement until things have
   blown over

    in other words if the anarchists
  dont get me the sicilians will said
  tommy sarcastically and cambioni
  irughed

     you treat it so lightly mr will-
  iams that i can hardly believe it my-
  self  but you have summed up the sit-
  uation pretty accurately he answered

      threatened men live long is an
  old english saying retorted tommy
  there is another danger which threat-
  ens me that t consider far more-serious
  than either of those you warn me of
   mr cambioni

    indeed then you must be in a
  bad way said the detective interrog-
  atively

    yes death from unsatisfied curi-
f ositv would be about the most disagree-
able form that i could imagine so i
i shall try to avoid it replied tommy
i it is quite within your power to place
 it beyond the possibilities

     you are trifling with me mr will-
   iams answered cambioni impatient-

l	ly i have told you that i did not
   come here in my official capacity but
  j because of information which had come
  to me in that capacity it is impossi-
  bh for me to confide all of my secrets
  in you but my warning is none the
  less sincere

     to be perfectly frank with you it is
 too much like an anonymous letter for
me to value it though said tommy
i indifferently

     you do not intend to profit by my
 advice and warning asked cambioni

    i do not intend to run away if
 thats what you mean answered tom-
 my positively the delays of the legal
i machinery may keep me cooling my
 heels about here for a long time but i
i shall have an interesting problem with
i which to occupy my leisure moments
my reason for conveying this warn-
i  to you  

  in part but more especially the in-
fluence which could induce a trusted
official of the government to act as the
messenger of the greatest rascal un-
hanged answered tommy and cam-
bionis expressive hands made a gesture
which practically acknowledged defeat

  mr williams your powers of induc-
tion were underestimated rather than
overestimated by our mutual friends
he said admiringly i want you to be-
lieve however that i have told you the
exact truth

  but not all of it retorted tommy
curtly

  as you say not all of it acknowl-
edged the detective my warning was
sincere and you would do well to heed
it but if you will not i cannot force
you to follow my advice

  and i da not suppose that you will
tell me the reason for the bond of sym-
pathy between yourself and van os-
ten suggested tommy cambioni
took -considerable time for reflection be-
fore answering

  mr williams the form of your ex-
pression is not a happy one but i am
willing to believe that you are not in-
tentionally insulting he said finally
my first duty in this world is to pro-
tect the members of the royal house
of savoy that protection has not
been adequate in the past and king
humberts death was the result of my
predecessors stupidity i will tell you
frankly that i would make any alliance
which would protect the people who
rely upon my sagacity and the punish-
ment of the ordinary criminal is of less
importance in my eyes than the gaining
of information which will aid me if
i could obtain from you a pledge of
absolute neutrality as regards van os-
ten it would enable me to get infor-
mation which would place a dozen of
the most dangerous men in europe be-
hind the bars but i knew too much
about vou to venture to make such a
proposition in spite of his disclaim-
er t saw that he was watching tommy
furtively to see the effect of his tacit
proposal and he was not left long in
doubt

  i should not make such a com-


the populr magazine

promise to save all the crowned heads
of europe he exclaimed and cam-
bioni nodded

  i have had my say mr williams
he said calmly the warnings are
absolutely sincere and justified by the
facts  f you do not profit by them
it is your own fault and your refusal
makes my task more difficult

  van osten made an alternate com-
promise proposition then demanded
tommy suspiciously and cambioni
smiled

  vou are a good guesser mr will-
iams and i shall be able to take ad-
vantage of it-after the inevitable has
happened he said with a significant
gesture caution on your part may
postpone it but it cannot make you
safe i have one more proposition to
make to you and perhaps another of
the great emotions may influence you
where fear has  failed

  lie careful cambioni said tommy
flushing and there was a dangerous
glint in his eyes i know that my
correspondence has been tampered
with but it would not be well for the
individual who has opened the letters
to make open confession

  and i would remind you that i
have been in italy for less than forty-
eight hours so i cannot be culpable
said cambioni i have profited by
the information of others however and
all sorts of strange happenings are re-
ported to the office of the secret police
would it induce you to change your
mind about remaining in sicily if i
could supply you with the address of
two ladies who have disappeared in the
maelstrom of balkan conspiracy and
whose whereabouts you would be glad
to know 

  you are familiar with contents of
the lady dianas last letter to me
demanded tommy fiercely

  with all of them corrected cam-
bioni as unperturbed by his anger as
he had been by his raillery we know
that the ladv followed what she con-
sidered to be her duty at the expense
of her inclination this was not per-
sonal mr williams it is the duty of
the political police to know the doin gs

of all those who are interested in dis-
turbing the existing order of things in
any part of europe the information
which we have gained goes no further
but naturally we could not let the two
ladies pass beyond our ken i know
that the lady diana refused to let you
follow her in the dangerous waters she
has elected to navigate and that she
took the only sure way to prevent it
by disappearing quietly from malta
with the princess sonia i can supply
you with their address and i assure
you that they are both in dire need of
all the assistance they can get hut i
must have the price of my informa-
tion

  damn you i believe youd betray
your brother to further your ambi-
tion exclaimed tommy angrily and
the italian seemed to regard the taunt
as a compliment

  i am faithful to my salt and i serve
the house of savoy he said proudly
in that service i know few scruples
and i consider it absolutely essential
that you leave sicily i should be en-
tirely willing to put you in possession
of all the information i have regarding
the ladies-and i assure you that it is
minute and accurate-if it would ac-
complish that result

  and i should refuse to listen to it
if you volunteered it without price
answered tommy who had regained a
certain measure of self-control i
recognize the hand of van osten in
that proposition too and i wish you
joy of your alliance now mr cam-
bioni that you have demonstrated to
me the peculiar working of the mind of
an italian secret agent i can tell you
that i have had enough of your society
to satisfy me for many a day you
can return to your friend in the prison
and tell him with my compliments that
my only regret is that he will not be
hanged higher than hainan and that i
shall do my best to send him up for
life the detective accepted his dis-
missal without protest simply suggest-
ing that we knew where to find him if
we hec-ded him and after he had gone
tommy turned to me with a rueful
smile on his lips
the mafia ant the contessa



   fools rush in where angels fear to
tread  he said bitterly i havent
given you my entire confidence old
chap close as we are to each other
and you have been considerate enough
to refrain from questioning me the
brute was truthful in his statement
about the lady diana however and i
o n up that t am not entirely happy
about her it was part of the unwrit-
ten law of our long and close intimacy
that certain things should remain un-
discussed between us and the last part
of the conversation with cambioni had
been a revelation to me even now i
wished to avoid a painful topic and i
was glad of the opportunity to change
the subject which tommy himself had
introduced

  but what of the rest of it i
asked i believe that the man was
equally truthful in his warning tom-
my he shrugged his shoulders and
lighted a fresh cigarette before answer-
ing

  in part yes he answered indiffer-
ently for an anarchistic group read
mafia and for america palermo and
we should be reasonably near the truth
about as close as you can ever get with
an itali  unless you possess a vivid
imagination

  but i cant see that it makes much
difference in the general result i an-
swered nervously for i had been rev-
eling in a peaceful life for several
weeks and had no desire for further
adventure a sicilian knife will kill
a man as dead as an anarchists bomb
and t have no ambition to be sacrificed
on the chance of furthering the ends
of justice

  it wouldnt be so messy a death
and there would be something to erect
a monument with a glowing epitaph
over said tommy grinning well
try to dodge em both old chap but
im not going to let up on van os-
ten

  then lets cut away until his trial
is announced t suggested and he
laughed at my proposal

  my dear boy you have paid me the
compliment to accept my conclusions
without asking for the grounds on

     

which i formed them-which is lucky
for your continued confidence in me
for it is largely guesswork if that
dago hadnt made me so hot under
the collar by butting into my private
affairs i should have turned him inside
out before he left but i was afraid id
assault him if he stayed in the studio
a minute longer now ive got to take
a little time to think out what i might
have pumped from him if  hadnt lost
my temper but its only a matter of
adding two and two together

  and while you are making your
patchwork the chances are that your
conspirators will manage to perforate
us i objected and tommy looked at
me curiously

  if i didnt know you so well i
should think that van ostens handling
of you had destroyed your nerve he
said grinning and i held out my hands
which still bore the marks of the pris-
oners brutality to me

  i dont know that i could be blamed
for a little nervousness i said and
tommy smiled reassuringly

  its just because i dont believe in
getting in a blue funk that  wont con-
sider running away he said i be-
lieve that i am right in calling this a
mafia affair and i have no doubt that
they will do their best to make it un-
pleasant for us here but forewarned is
forearmed on the other hand you
may rest assured that wherever two or
three sicilian fruit-venders and organ-
grinders are gathered together there is
an organized lodge of that society in
full working-order and there is no city
on earth which would be attractive
where we should be safe the world
is not large enough when you start to
run away and the fact that van osten
tries to scare us off betrays his fear
of us well fight it out oi this line
if it takes all summer and ill do my
best to see that he gets all thats com-
ing to him

  rut tommy you do realize that
the situation is dangerous do you not
i asked

  so dangerous that i shall not onnt
the slightest precaution he answered
seriously im not running my head


the povular magazine

against stone walls but lra not going

lo	be frightened by shadows until i
know what casts them if we run
away from sicily well have a cold
chill every time we hear a hand-organ
grind out santa lucia or funiculi
funicula and the sight of a banana
would give us nervous prostration
well make a clean-up here before we
go and your uncle thomas will either
join the mafia himself or give it a jolt
which will make its members keep at a
respectful distance

   realized that tommys boasting
was designed to restore my own droop-
ing confidence a kindly effort which
was not altogether successful and my
apprehension was not relieved when he
took the precaution to hand me a
loaded pistol and slip its fellow into
his own pocket before answering a
light knocking on the door of the
studio

ii

  in spite of my nervousness i smiled
at our melodramatic precautions when
tommy opened the door for our vis-
itor proved to be a girl of eighteen or
nineteen years of age and her manner
evidenced that she was apprehensive of
her own reception tommy admitted
her and then glanced expectantly at
the hallway for a companion but she
motioned to him to close the door be-
fore she spoke

  i am alone which of course violates
all of the proprieties but it is the only
way i could think of to get an op-
portunity to speak with you she said
nervously my errand must be mv
excuse and as you gentlemen are both
americans i trust that you will not
judge me by the standards of my own
country she spoke rapidly with the
volubility of extreme nervousness and
tommy looked at her curiously the
suggestion of suspicion in his eyes in-
dicating that cambioni s warning had
produced due effect imd that he was
prepared to find danger in everything

  before you go farther may i ask
if any one knows of your visit here
he asked quickly

  no one  slipped away from my
people in the crowd coming from the
cathedral and made my way here
alone she answered and tommy
walked over and locked the door

  you will excuse the precaution but
there are times when it is better to be
secure from interruption he said as
he slipped the key in his pocket if
you were found here it might lead to
embarrassment for everybody con-
cerned he continued significantly
may i ask your name and why you
have honored us with this visit  there
was nothing cordial in his manner and
his unusual reception of our visitor
proved that he had taken cambionis j
communication more seriously than he 
had acknowledged

  have i done very wrong in com-
ing she asked flushing i should 
never have ventured no matter what 
the urgency if you had net been
americans

  but the fact remains that we are
temporarily residing in italy and to a
certain extent we must respect the cus-
toms and prejudices of the country
replied tommy dryly i can assure
you lhat you are as safe as if you had
been accompanied by a dozen duennas
but that would hardly excuse you in
the eyes of your own people and i 
doubt if it would save us from very 
unpleasant consequences if you were j
discovered here by your relatives who 
might have followed you the flush j
died from her race and she started to- r
ward the door

  it you will be kind enough to let f
me out i shall not expose you to fur-
ther danger by my presence she said
contemptuously i thought that

  one moment please interrupted
tommy there are reasons for my
precaution and suspicion you have
yourself acknowledged that your visit
here violated all of the conventions of
your people i know italians well
enough to appreciate what such a pro-
ceeding might lead to and at the mo-
ment we have every reason to walk
softly and avoid all things which might
be an excuse for trouble if you will
the mafia and the con tessa



  he good enough to tell me who you are
  and the reason for your visit it might
  allay the suspicions which its uncon-
  ventionally has aroused the girl
  hesitated for a moment and as she
  looked from one to the other of us her
  large black eyes became suspiciously
  moist and her lips quivered

    i am elisa drago the daughter of
  the baron giuseppe drago of trapa-
  ni she said in a trembling voice i
  came here to say what i feared to com-
  municate to you in any other way and
  to crave your assistance the name
  meant nothing to me but stored away
  in tommys brain were all sorts of
  queer odds and ends of information
  and the effect upon him was magical
  his entire manner changed suspicion
  gave way to interest and he was all
  cordiality as he invited her to be seated

i can only assure you that my ap-
parent rudeness was entirely justified
by circumstances he said apologet-
ically i am entirely at your dispo-
 sition signorina and i trust that you
i will forgive me

    mr williams is your nervousness
l caused by fear of the mafia she
asked tacitly accepting his excuses by
her change in manner

    you came here to convey informa-
i tion not to ask for it i believe he
 answered evasively and she nodded

    i asked the question only to save
 time she said it is because of that
r society that i am here

   but surely the daughter of the
i baron drago is not in sympathy with
 the aims of that society he exclaimed
 and the gesture of protest gave elo-
 quent denial

    mr wiliams you know that he has
i spent his life in fighting all that it rep-
i resents she protested i believe
t that you are familiar with the effects
i of the mafia on the life of southern
i italy and know that it is the curse of
i sicily its influence has spread out-
l side and is carried wherever its mem-
 hers emigrate but it has never before
i interfered with foreigners residing in
f italy -

    before said tommy interrogative-
i ly and she nodded assent

  perhaps i should have said as yet
but its action follows so quickly on res-
olution that it would be a distinction
without a practical difference she an-
swered i know that some one has
been before me in conveying a warning
to you but mine is none the less wor-
thy of attention

  i am listening said tommy curtlv
when she paused but the girl remained
silent for a long time as if trying to
find words

  it isnt easy mr williams she
finally said no girl ever found her-
self in a more difficult position you
know the traditions of my family and
yet i find myself here as the messenger
of the mafia unofficially of course
but nevertheless carrying its message
which is

  that you leave italy at once and
never return to it she said reluctantly

  and you would advise me to obey
that command he asked skeptically

  as my fathers daughter i should
say defy them as he has always done
as a girl whose whole future happiness
is involved in your fate i beg you to
obey she said quietly and this time
the moisture in her eyes formed tear-
which rolled unheeded down her cheeks
as she looked at him imploringly
tommy looked at her curiously for a
moment before answering

  you have told me too much or too
little he said kindly can you ex-
plain the reason for your conflicting
counsels 

  one part you should know without
asking she answered after a furtive
dab at her eyes with her handkerchief
you know the part that the mafia
plays in the politics of sicily at the
last three elections my father has rep-
resented all that is best in the com-
munity and opposed the election of sig-
nor nasi in trapani you know that
he has been unsuccessful nasi has al-
ways been reelected and it is the in-
fluence of the mafia which has made
that possible my fathers supporters
are intimidated and do not dare to vote
and the few who have risked it have
had bitter cause to regret their temer-
ity we have all been persecuted


the popular magazine

more or less bul so far we have not
suffered personal violence

  yes that part of it is familiar to
me it is the other-the reason for
your advice to run away-that i am
curious about said tommy and the
girls eyes did not meet his when she
answered

  cant you accept the advice arid act
upon it without demanding the rea-
son  she faltered

  accept it yes but  could not
promise to act upon it even if i knew
why you gave it he answered and she
rose from her chair and motioned to
him to open the door

  it is given in all sincerity mr will-
iams she said hopelessly i have
done my best and i have told you that
my happiness is bound up with your
safety i cant tell you more and i
shall ask you to let me go

  but i dont feel that  can do that
until you have told me more protest-
ed tommy earnestly you have never
so far as i know set eyes on me be-
fore so i appreciate that your anxiety
is not for my personal safety i can
imagine but one reason for it and per-
haps if you will be frank i can assist

you to-

  no no no she interrupted ve-
hemently you must not ask it-you
must not attempt to discover from any
one else or you will bring misery and
disgrace on me

  signorina if you have told me the
truth-and from what i have previous-
ly learned i believe that you have-
you will understand that i am prac-
tically fighting for my life replied
tommy soothingly i give you my
word of honor that anything you may
tell us shall go no farther but  cant
pledge myself to refrain froir getting
information which may serve me i
tell you frankly and honestly that i
have no animosity for the mafia and
the reasons for its threats are an en-
tire mystery to me but i do not intend
to run away nor shall  submit to its
decrees without a fight it would be
wiser for you to trust us absolutely
now that you have said so much for
i shall try to get at the bottom of this

thing a- a matter of self-protection
i should much prefer to feel that i was
not running the risk of injuring you in
the steps i shall be forced to take and
if you are not entirely frank with me
i might do that in ignorance the
girl iiesitated and a pitiful expression
of fear came to the soft dark eyes

  i wish that i dared to speak she
said wistfully i have risked much in
coming here mr williams and diat
should convince you of my sincerity
that was nn own risk however but
if i said more it would imperil others
oh i cant i dare not she shrank
back from him and covered her eyes
with her hands and tommy glanced at
me helplessly

  confound it cant you suggest
something he said in english i
cant do anything with a weeping fe-
male and the firt tiling i know shell
have me making all sort of rash prom-
ises

  i wish that you would promise to
do what she asks you i answered
quickly im for the simple life in
some place as far away from italy as
steam will carry us the girls sob-
bing ceased with suspicious suddenness
and she smiled through her tears when
she dropped her hands from her face
and turned to me

  i should weep oceans of tears if it
would influence him to meet your
wishes she exclaimed eagerly in
english as perfect as our own do
make him listen to me and go away

  im quite ready to listen but im
not going away replied tommy flush-
ing before i could answer signorina
this is serious and no time for play-
acting if you can be perfectly frank
with me i am willing to do mv part
and i shall respect your confidence if
not i shall have to go about getting
information in my own way and  can
give you no promise as to what use i
shall make of it after i have obtained
it

  i am sorry mr williams she an-
swered humbly i was not acting i
was absolutely sincere i should be
willing to make any personal sacrifice
to induce vou to leave sicily at once
the mafia ano the contessa



 but i cannot betray the secrets of
 others

   then i shall try to find ant so
 much of them as may affect my per-
 sonal safety answered tommy un-
 locking the door for there was no mis-
 taking the finality of her refusal if
 it leads to injury to yourself in any
 way i trust that you will remember
 that i have tried to avoid that chance

   i can only hope that you will re-
 consider your determination to remain
 here she said wistfully pausing in
 the-open doorway to face us if not
 i have no fear that information which
 you may obtain will harm me or those
 i care for hut your death which is in-
 evitable will cause me the greatest sor-
 row i have ever known she stepped
 back and drew the door close after
 her before either of us could say a
 word in reply and tommy turned to
 me with an expression of disappoint-
 ment on his face

   im not sure that a dago male or
 female isnt mofe of an adept at con-
 cealing what is passing through the
 mind than the blandest chinaman that
 ever laundried a shirt he exclaimed
 irritably and throwing himself in an
 easy chair he lighted a cigarette and
 snapped his case close with a vicious
 click

hi

   the absorption of nicotin speedily
 soothed tommys irritability without
 deadening his mental processes and the
  closing of his case after he removed
 the second cigarette from it was so
 gentle that it was barely audible

    warnings are as thick as leaves in
 yallambrosa he remarked when he
 had discarded the end of the first after
 lighting the second from it i won-
 der what  sort of a messenger will
 bring the next one

    j trust that it wont be made of lead
  or steel i replied gloomily if these
  beggars are in earnest there will prob-
  ably be no further warning and the
  kind of action they usually take leaves
  little room for argument i move that
  we make it twenty-three tommy he
  blew a succession of smoke rings into

the air before answering and the set
of his face told me that my advice
would not be considered

  my dear boy  havent the slightest
doubt about their being in earnest in
wanting to get rid of us but i am
skeptical about their courage in doing it
in the only really effectual way he
said as a matter of fact which has
been demonstrated time and time again
in my own experience the man who is
to be feared is the one who gets after
you with a gun without saying a word
not the one who sends people to tell
you what he intends to do to you when
he catches you out alone if they had
dared to do us up it would have been
simple enough to have accomplished it
without giving warning in any one of
a dozen different ways which would
have cast no suspicion on themafia
thats what made me suspicious when
this drago girl came here alone so
closely on the heels of cambionis an-
nouncement it was perfectly evident
at first glance that she was not of the
class which goes alone in italy and i
suspected a plot until she told me
who she was i should not have been
surprised to have a bunch of outraged
relatives appear to carve us up with
long sicilian daggers it would have
needed no explanation that sort of
thing is considered quite proper in
italy and we would have been quietly
buried without any one even hinting at
a mafia murder

  how in the deuce did you happen
to know anything about her father-
have you been studying italian poli-
tics i asked and he laughed and
pointed to a palermo paper on the ta-
ble

  not italian politics but the italian
language he said i read that re-
ligiously to keep from getting rusty
and incidentally absorb the news it con-
tains as a matter of fact this nasi
business which is looked upon so light-
ly here is a matter of humiliation for
all of northern italy in rome they
realize that it makes italy the laughing-
stock of europe and yet there is no way
of getting at him so long as he can
control his own constituency sicily


the popular magazine

is always unsettled and any arbitrary
action might lead to serious trouble
but i believe that the central govern-
ment is this time trying to beat him at
the polls they have transferred such
a large force of carabinieri to his dis-
trict that the supporters of baron
drago will be assured protection
against the mafia and if lie can defeat
nasi he will be sent to serve out his
sentence  imagine that they have got
the members of that brotherhood guess-
ing so hard that they would hesitate to
attract attention to themselves by really
getting after us

  but what have they got against us
anyway i asked and tommy
shrugged his shoulders

   che lo so as they reply here
w hen you ask an impossible question
he said that society has been more
successful in concealing its real objects
and its membership than any of the
other associations which have come
down from antiquity i believe that
originally it was purely political but
now its active membership is made up
largely of the dregs of sicily-which
are just a little bit more loathsome
than any other human refuse that i
know of-and the politicians use it for
their own ends protecting its members
from deserved punishment and winking
at the blackmail which they extort from
the decent members of the community
when it is a purely local affair they
dont hesitate to assassinate any one
who refuses to submit but i reckon
they steer clear of the foreigners in
italy tourists supply a good part of
the revenue and its less risky to black-
mail the moneyout of the botel-keepers
and those who get it more or less legit-
imately than to try for it direct

  but that still offers no reason for
threatening us i protested and
tommy held up his fingers in mimicry
of cambioni

  it isnt necessary to go into details
he said we have been good little
boys lately and have attended strictly
to our own business but in the past
we have been foolish enough to mix
up with the police and other undesira-
ble people who knows how severely

we may have tread on the toes of some
of the high cockalorums of that gang
of thieves its either a matter of re-
venge for that or a measure of pre-
caution because they are up to some
particular piece of deviltry which we
might interfere with i am as much
in the dark about it as you can possibly
be but   bet if wre ever find out we
shall discover that our friend van os-
ten is somewhere near the storm-cen-
ter

  tommy are we never to be finished
with that man  i exclaimed in dismay
i thought he wras safe enough behind
the bars and that we had nothing to
fear from him

   its because i want to feel confi-
dent of that that i refuse to be scared
away by a bunch of blackmailers at
least thats one reason he answered
grinning by tove i believe vou hit
it

  hit what i asked but he was so
eagerly following out the idea which
had occurred to him that he paid no
attention to the question i knew of
old that it wrould be useless to insist j
until lie was ready to speak and tried j
to possess my soul in patience hut i
could make neither head nor tail out
of the jumble of complications

  perhaps cambioni is not such a 
blamed rascal as i took him for after 
all he said apparently irrelevantly 
after a long pause lie made me an- 
gry by interfering in my private af- 
fairs but well assume that he is hon-
est at least in his special work

  and if we do it is the anarchists
as well as the mafia who are after us i
i said ruefully and tommy answered
with a gesture of impatience

  on the contrary it makes that
fairy-tale seem all the more improb- j
able he exclaimed i do believe y
that he is faithful to the particular trust 
which is given to him and its no light 
job to keep those devils from murder-
ing the entire royal family he was i
perfectly frank about his code of mor-
als in that he places his work higher
than the ordinary administration of jus-
tice and he wouldnt hesitate to make a
bargain which would turn van osten
the mafia and the con tessa



  loose if he thought it would lead to the
  safety of his charges it is more than
  probable that van osten could supply
  him with valuable information for he
  has been hand in glove with all of the
  underworld and i dare say has been an
  anarchist in his time if it suited his
  purpose

    but why mix us up in it if it is
  within his power to release a prisoner
  i dont see why he should come fussing
  around foreigners tommy looked
  at me in mock pitv

    my dear fellow you should take
  something for that lack of perception
  of yours he said dont you see
  that the whole prosecution would drop
  if we were scared off captain stuart
  expressly stipulated that he should not
  be dragged into legal proceedings and
  the other witnesses are italians if they
  could get rid of us the rest would be
  easy for a word to them would be
  sufficient van osten proposes that
  bargain and cambioni jumps at it if
  you will recall his conversation you
  will see that he virtually admitted it
  cambioni tries to scare us with his
  anarchist story but fearing that wont
  work he has another string to his bow
  and passes the word to the mafia to
  get busy

   and baron dragos daughter i
  suggested for he apparently left her
  warning entirely out of the theory

    thats a case of cause and effect
  answered tommy confidently a
  montague and capulet sort of an af-
  fair unless i miss my guess i cant
  imagine anything else which would in-
  duce her to run the risk of coming
  here

    as how i asked in bewilderment
  unable to follow his rapid deductions

remember some of our earlier ex-
periences and how unsuccessful we
were in guessing where women were
 concerned he said laughing i dont
 suppose that we are much wiser now
but the affairs of men enter into this
that young woman in coming here did
a thing which would condemn her for-
i ever in the eyes of her class i can
imagine but one thing which would in-
duce her to run such a risk

  a lover  i said and he nodded and
smiled

  you are improving he said mock-
ingly	guessed right the first
time sift it down and youll find a
nice little mafia boy at the bottom of
all her anxiety about yours truly its
probable that he has scared her with
some cock-and-bull story about hav-
ing drawn the black bean which makes
him the one to run us down or some-
thing of that kind i honestly believe
that so far as any real danger to us
goes it is all an opera-bouffe affair
but there is always the one little chance
that some one of these assassins may
be carried away by his artistic tempera-
ment and think that lies playing the
game for keeps so well be on the safe
side

  and leave sicily i asked hopeful-
ly and tommy tapped the pistol in his
pocket and laughed

  we shall not play the game quite
so seriously as that old chap but it is
time that we went to dinner and well
carry these with us he said and com-
forting myself with his cheerful esti-
mate of the lack of danger i prepared
to accompany him we were to dine
at the cafe progresso in the middle
of the town and there was no apparent
reason for apprehension but i found
myself examining the revolver which
tommy had handed me most carefully
and his eyes twinkled when i disposed
it in a pocket where it would be con-
venient to my hand

  when we had turned into the cafe
from the street the wild strains of a
hungarian czardas came to our ears as
wre entered the head waiter had re-
served a table for us in our favorite
corner and as tommy went through the
menu and ordered our dinner  watched
the musicians a nondescript band of
gipsies in red jackets with yellow-braid
trimmings the wearers just a little more
unkempt and untidy the uniforms just
a shade shabbier than those worn by
their kind in the restaurants of paris
the leader a small wiry man swarthy
of skin with small piercing black eyes
and a shock of long black hair seemed
possessed of unusual nervous energy


the popular magazine

even for the conductor of a hungarian
orchestra and it seemed to me that he
devoted an undue share of attention to
the observation of tommy who was
absorbed in the congenial task of or-
dering the dinner me turned to him
constantly leaving his wild compan-
ion- to follow the strains of his violin
rather than the movements of his nerv-
ous head in the keeping of time and
his eyes were like points of maine as he
watched him from tinder his low brow
and projecting masses of black lashes

  its only the manner of his kind and
profession replied tommy smiling
when i told him that the man was
watching him we are evidently for-
eigners and experience has taught him
that it is not to the natives lie must
look for his profits when he passes the
plate hell be around here to squeak
his fiddle in our ears directly as a spe-
cial compliment-and to get a special
donation i was familiar with the
habits of the gipsy musicians for i
had seen them ply their trade in a
dozen cities but the interest which this
man took in tommy seemed different
i knew that he would circle around
among the tables pausing to play a
few bars at each until he discovered
one where the guests were particularly
sympathetic but never had t seen one
of them single out a new-comer so
markedly and watch him from the mo-
ment of entrance

  we had agreed to drop all of our
suspicions and worries during dinner
remonstrated tommy good-naturedly
w hen i reiterated the result of my ob-
servations you are getting as fidgety
as an old woman forget it and pitch
into this anti post a we havent found
salami like this in many a day tom-
mys anxieties never interfered with
his appetite nor his appreciation of
good food and he refused even to turn
around to look at the man until the
first course had been disposed of i
watched him however anti never for
a minute at a time did he remove his
sharp gaze from my companion while
he absolutely ignored groups of ameri-
cans and english at the other tables

  i never saw the beggar before that

i know of said tommy shrugging
his shoulders indifferently after he had
taken a glance at him they are all
vagabonds and wander over the face
of the earth so its possible that he
may have seen me but i cant discover
that hes radically different from the
others of his kind unless it is that lies
a trifle springier and more unkempt
the man had seemed to be stimulated
to unusual effort in the way of nervous
contortion by tommys attention and
the music-they were playing a mag-
yar version of the mikado at the
moment-changed to a frankly barbaric
air there was something familiar
about it to me although i could not
have given it a name but tommy
whirled about in his chair and looked
again at the leader

  what is that tune tommy i
asked when he turned back to the
table but he did not answer and from
the puzzled look on his face i thought
he too was at a loss for the name it
ended in a wild burst of melody in
which the xylophone-player seemed to
be trying to beat the strings out of
the box with his hammers and every
violin and viola-plaver scraped his
hardest to a grand climax then
while the members of the orchestra
rested from their labors the leaders
violin started a solo inaudible at first
in the clatter of the restaurant but
quickly compelling silence by its beauty
then i knew w hat the other had been
the servian national anthem which the
princess sonia had played for us one
evening in malta for the other was a
wild love-song of the balkans which
the iadv dianas rich contralto had
chanted in the governors drawing-
room at la valetta tommys face
was a study while the hungarian
played and when the song which ran
the full gamut of desire longing dis-
appointment passion and satiety was
finished he drew his card-case from his
pocket and took out a bank-note

  have you had enough of it i
asked thinking that he intended to pay
our dinner-check  but he shook his
head and turning in his chair beckoned
to the leader to come to him
the mafia and the contessa



  you play well my friend he said
in italian when the hungarian stopped
in front of the table violin and bow
under his arm tommy was looking
searchingly into the small black eyes
while he rolled the bank-note between
his fingers have i heard your music
some place before 

  che lo sa signori answered the
gipsy many places have i been in
the waldorf of new york in winter
garten von berlin liabe ich gespielt
chez maxim a paris-

  but where last demanded tommy
interrupting the polyglot speech which
employed scraps of four different lan-
guages in a short sentence and holding
the bank-note so that its denomination
-which was large-was plainly visible
the gipsy looked covetously at it and
then furtively about the room

  you like the music of the moun-
tains he said in barbarous italian
it is -ot the music of italy soft sen-
suous and only fh for their hand-organs
to play which pleases the signor he
likes the music which tells of a land
where men fight for those they love
where red blood runs in the veins of
the men and fair women have eyes and
thoughts only for the brave is it not
so

 where is that land magyar
asked tommy and the gipsy smiled and
shook his head

  i shall make my violin tell you
he said taking it from under his arm
and before tommy could interrupt him
with further questioning he had drawn
his bow across it and brought from its
strings such a note as i had never
heard it was the wail of a soul in
torment the cry of a mother bereft of
her child the very essence of all the
pain and misery which have ever been
in the world but it was as nothing to
what followed with head thrown
back and eyes closed lie played like a
man in a trance oblivious to every-
thing about him to the lights and con-
fusion of the restaurant over which a
strange hush fell as the air went on
to the hundreds of pairs of curious eyes
fixed on him the orchestra played a
soft minor accompaniment but no one

noticed it for every one looked at and
listened to the leader it must have
been improvisation for never before
nor since did any one in that room hear
its like but it was the improvisation of
a man inspired to me that violin
spoke as plainly as ever did man by
word of mouth and as  looked at
tommys face which became pale and
drawn as he listened i knew that he
too heard the same story

  it was the call of a woman in agony
for succor or mercy now babbling out
pleas for aid and sympathy then pro-
testing against her pain again passion-
ately demanding the justice which was
denied her visions of stern rugged
mountains rose before my eyes i saw
the rude hamlets attacked by hordes
of savage horsemen the brutality of
the sacking of the towns the massacre
of the helpless the nameless atrocities
of barbarian warfare through it all
as one theme weaves in ami out
through the music of an entire opera
ran a strain which told of the agony
and suffering of some one person and
all the rest seemed but a setting but
it was an appeal a cry of one in dire
need

  i dont know how long the hunga-
rian played it was one of those things
which could not be measured by min-
utes or hours but i was conscious lhat
i wished to close my ears and at the
same time feared to have him cease be-
fore the story was finished i too was
unconscious of my surroundings save
that i saw the white face of the player
and it was in his eyes concealed by
the closed lids that i seemed to see
the pictures which is music conjured
up as the crystal-gazer under the sug-
gestion of the charlatan sees strange
visions in the depths of a sphere of
glass then at the moment when it
seemed as if the denouement of the
story must come in the next few notes
the music stopped abruptly the violin-
ist lowered his bow and a murmur
half of protest half of relief came from
the other guests the hungarian stoud
before us smiling and smirking the
typical begging itinerant fiddler all
inspiration gone from his face


the popular magazine

  my tune pleased the signor he
said extending his hand for largess
and tommy crushed the bank-note in
his hand and leaned toward him

  damn you finish it he hissed so
menacingly that the gipsy stepped back

  it is for the signor to finish he
answered his eves fixed on the clenched
hand which held the money  i he poor
tzigane begins many stories he dreams
many dreams but he is a vagabond and
it is the signors who always end them
- when there is profit to be gained

  and no one ever heard of a gipsy
finishing a fortune until his palm had
been crossed with silver said tommy
hinging the note to him contemptuous-
ly tell me what you have to say
the hungarian caught the fluttering
paper deftly and his small eyes glis-
tened as he stuffed it into his pocket

  the signor is generous he ex-
claimed and then in a voice so low that
his words were hardly audible to us
not here signor williams already
half of the people in the restaurant are
watching us and listening to-morrow
afternoon sketch near the bridle-path of
monte pelligrino and i will finish my
tune for you he was bowing while
he spoke and i think that the others
believed that he was mumbling thanks
for tommys generosity and before
tommy could question him further he
backed away and made the circuit of
the other tables plate in hand

  come lets get out of this said
tommy curtly i want to get where
its quiet to think this out we paid
our check and left the cafe and i real-
ized that my own preoccupation had
been so great that t had momentarily
forgotten the danger against which we
had been warned when t saw at one
table cambioni dining alone at another
signorina klisa drago with a tall dis-
tingmshed-looking man with a red rib-
bon in the lapel of his coat

  tommy what the cfeuce was there
about that mans playing which mail
me s-e things i ventured as we
walked toward the studio and he turned
ami glanced at me curiously

  you saw things too eh he said
gravely what it was i dont know

but he carried me many miles from
italy hypnotism perhaps for those
mongrels are an uncanny lot but what
he made me see was for a man whose
heart is filled with anxiety for a wom-
an he believes to be in danger a realis-
tic rejesentation of hell

iv

  a half-finished sketch was on the
easel under the great white umbrella
but the camp-stool in front of it was
deserted and tommy was stretched out
on the turf with his hands clasped be-
hind his head the blue smoke from the
cigarette in the corner of his mouth
curling lazily in the still air as he
watched with eager eyes the bridle-
path below us we were high on the
slope of the monte pelligrino and be-
low us on the right the beautiful plain
of the concha doro with its lemon and
orange-grovcs stretched down tu meet
the deep blue water of the mediterra-
nean  the white houses of palermo
gleaming in the sunshine between look-
ing like a great cluster of pearls sur-
rounded by emeralds and sapphires
we were fjoth oi us heavy-eyed and
tired for we bad passed a sleepless
night tommy miserable with appre-
hension for the safety of the lady
diana while i found in the mysterious
warnings which had been conveyed to
us so much to worry about that i could
not keep my eyes closed his impa-
tience had brought us to the rendezvous
with the gipsy long before the appoint-
ed time and he had worked doggedly
at his easel for two or three hours his
brushes mechanically putting the paints
on canvas for his mind was not on
his work

    cant explain the effect which that
music had on us he said wearily after
watching the path for a long time in
silence  never heard any tiling like
it bci m c and that infernal fiddle seemed
possessed of a hundred tongues i
suppose that the airs which preceded
it had put me in a proper frame of
mind to be receptive to suggestion but
in all my study of hypnotism-and you
know that  went into that as thor-
the mafia and the contessa



oughly as any one ever did-i never
ran across anything like that

  i wonder if the others in the room
were affected in the same way i ven-
tured the servian anthem and the
balkan love-song could not have con-
veyed a meaning to them but when
he played to us at the table there was
absolute silence in the robm and even
the waiters stood quietly until he fin-
ished

  i know it and it suggested the
scientific explanation of the indian jug-
glers rope-trick to me answered
tommy thoughtfully dozens of trav-
elers have described that and many
whose words are absolutely trustworthy
declare that they have seen the jug-
gler stand in the middle of a great
open space and cast a rope into the air
in such a way that it remained upright
with no visible means of support up
this a boy climbs up and up until he
is lost to sight in the sky and after he
has disappeared the juggler claps his
hands the rope disappears and the boy
is beside him on the ground  bowing
smiling and preparing to pass the hat
of course the actual performance of
that feat is beyond the range of possi-
bility even in the mysterious east but
hundreds of people are firmly con-
vinced that they have seen it done

  there is only one possible explana-
tion for it the juggler hypnotizes his
entire audience and wills them to see it
i have seen the photograph of the per-
formance taken by an english officer
in india he swears tat he saw the
rope thrown and saw the boy ascend
and he took a snap shot of it when he
developed the plate it showed the circle
of spectators standing with heads
thrown back and mouths open in won-
derment like a crowd of yokels watch-
ing a balloon-ascension at a country
fair but there was no rope nor no boy
the fakir had gone far enough into the
mysteries to be able to hypnotize an
entire audience but he couldnt hocus-
pocus a sensitive pholographic-plate

  and you think the gipsy hypnotized
hi entire audience last night i asked
incredulously

  i believe that he him flammed us at

any rate admitted tommy ruefully
im glad that he made his appointment
for as retired a place as this apparent-
ly we have the mountain to ourselves
and if he gets away from me without
giving an explanation it will be because
hes a better man than i am

  is it to be a contest of hypnotists
i asked and tommy shook his head
but his eyes did not meet mine

  you know that i gave that up he
said slowly not because i had ever
put the power i had acquired to bad
use for i never abused it i am afraid
of it though afraid of what i might
do with it and i had resolved never to
employ it again its a temptation in
this instance which i can hardly resist
for i dont believe that my hand has
lost its cunning at the game dont you
think i would be justified in forgetting
my good resolutions

  i am in the frame of mind to be-
lieve anything justifiable i answered
eagerly we are not bothering any
one we are trying to attend to our own
business and yet we are placed on the
defensive i feel as if we had our
backs against a wall and that we are
entitled to employ any weapon of de-
fense which comes to our hands
tommy looked at nie quizzically and
shrugged his shoulders

  the trouble is that we are not argu-
ing from the same grounds so  cant
accept your advance absolution he
said i dont know that the tzigane
is mixed up with our other troubles at
all if i forget my resolution to get
at him it will not be to save our own
skins  but possibly to get us in deeper
trouble by obtaining information which
will induce us to follow the princess
and the lady diana

  that would take us away from
sicily at any rate i suggested

  and for all we know to the con-
trary out of the frying-pan into the
fire answered tommy confound
it that beggar gave me the creeps and
what he made me hear and see could
have but one interpretation a woman
is in terrible danger and calls on me
for help and if he refuses to tell me all
he knows i believe that i should be


the popular magazine

justified in torturing him to get the
information

  its the woman is it not tommy
i asked for the first time permitting
invself such a liberty and he straight-
ened up and threw away his cigarette

  yes its the ionian old chap he
said quietly the only one i have
ever asked to be my wife she cares
for me too she makes no denial of
that but she refuses to bind herself
further until the princess has come into
her own

  and to let you aid her in her ef-
forts to bring that about

  absolutely and flatly after our last
experience he said regretfully she
even refused to tell me where they
were going for fear  should follow i
suppose but we know enough of the
past to forecast the future if they have
ventured within reach of the men they
are conspiring against she promised
me that i should see her again when
it was possible that she would send
for me if she were in trouble from
which i could help to extricate her and
it was her voice which called to me
from that gipsys violin last night he
knew my name he knew the airs which
would arouse my attention and make
me listen to him but gipsylike he
wants to drive a bargain he could
have delivered her message if he car-
ries one without this mystery  but in
that he sees opportunity for profit
lie paused for a moment and the look
which came to his face told me that
it would be ill for the gipsy to trifle
with him

  he will find me ready to bargain
he continued grimly i have come
fairly well provided with the sinews of
war and there is enough in my pocket
to make him independent of fiddling
for the ret of his life but if he holds
out too long liell never cat another
goulash and ill have his information or
kill him he jumped to his feet as
he spoke and gazed eagerly down the
bridle-path

  by jove hes coming he ex-
claimed i saw some one on the path
down there i am sure a moment
later he turned to me with an exclama-

tion of disappointment only a coh-
tadiua girl with her burden  he said
irritably confound it theres been
no one about here all day and now that
we want the place to ourselves i sup-
pose that there will be people passing
every minute i was watching the
girl who climbed the tortuous path far
below us the bright hues i f the con-
tadira costume making a brilliant patch
of color in the landscape and it seemed
to me that she was coming up the path
at an unusual speed on her head was
balanced one of the long slender casks
which the peasants use to transport
their oil and wine and she steadied it
with one hand while she used the other
to aid her in climbing short cuts over
the rocks when the path made long
curves to avoid difficult places

  tommy theres somebody after
her i never saw one of these people
hustle like that   exclaimed

  its more likely lhat shes been
loitering in the town and knows that
theres a thrashing ahead of her if she
doesnt make up the lost time he
answered irritably she cant get past

us too quickly to suit- great scott

do you see who it is she had ap-
proached so rapidly that we had a good
view of her face and there was no mis-
taking it art had been called to as-
sist nature in giving her skin the
bronze which the contadina girls get
from the burning sicilian sun but the 
eyes and features were those of the girl
who had visited the studio and dined
at the cafe progresso the night before
we were about fifteen feet above the
path under the shelter of a high ledffe
of rocks and tommy started to climb
down to intercept her but she motioned
to him to keep back

  i have a message for you from my
sister elisa she called she warns
you to escape mr williams you are
both in serious danger she had
paused in her own flight for a moment
but when tommy would have ques-
tioned her she started on again

  the man who was to meet you must
fly too she called back and before
we got to the path she had disappeared
around the corner of the ledge of rocks
the mafia and the contessa



  confound it they must be twins i
exclaimed tommy in bewilderment
what the dickens could she have been
driving at

  i move that we try to catch her and
find out  answered nervously for
her warning conveyed only one thing
to me we should be easy fruit for

the mafia here and-

  damn the mafia exploded tom-
my i dont care a hoot for all the
anarchists and conspirators in italy
for here comes my man the gipsy
was in plain view below coming up the
path with an ease which told of famil-
iarity with climbing and tommy had
thoughts for no one else but i had
read fear in the girls eyes and believed
enough in her warning to wish to profit
by it	

  cant we adjourn our meeting i
asked and tommy turned on me
fiercely

  go if you want to he said warn-
ingly if you stay here keep quiet
and say nothing of having seen the girl
until i have finished with this man i
must get to the bottom of this business
and find out w hat the connection is be-
tween the different ones who are try-
ing to bedevil us there was no ques-
tion of my deserting him and i knew
that remonstrance would be useless so
i held my peace until the gipsy joined
us a few minutes later

  the signori have selected a pleasant
place he sail glancing a front the small
natural amphitheater in the rocks and
then without further ceremony he ap-
propriated he camp-stool before the
easel

  are von ready to finish your story
demanded tommy curtly and the tzi-
gane looked at him with twinkling eyes

  t have not brought my violin he
answered with just a suspicion of de-
fiance in his tone the piper must be
paid you know and i was not sure
that you would meet my price

   h would expedite matters if you
would tell me what you have to dispose
of nd what price you put on it an-
swered tommy impatiently and the
tzigane nodded

  my wares are of value-to you he
said the signor knows my countrv

  i know the customs and manners of
your kind the world over replied
tommy ihave no time to waste in
words if you have a message to de-
liver you would do well to trust to
my generosity you will gain nothing
by making a mystery of it

  even if the message did not please
you said the gipsy cunningly our
life makes my people suspicious signor
we have learned that the people pay
willingly only for that which they wish
to hear

  what is your name  demanded
tommy irrelevantly

  boris signor it does as well as an-
other for the moment answered the
tzigane grinning and tommy nod-
ded

  ill remember that for your tomb-
stone if you make it necessary he
said grimly see here boris if you
have a message tell it to me and ill
pay you according to its value if you
are only possessed of information
which you think i might be induced to
pay for give me an idea of what it is
and ill give you a quick answer on
whether i wish to purchase

  the signor likes the music of the
balkans-when it tells of love last
night he paid me generously for my
playing would he be as generous if
i sang songs of another kind those
which tell of war of the fierce raids of
the wild horsemen of women carried

off on saddle-bows of--

  i believe you told me of that with
vour infernal fiddling interrupted
tommy who had taken his stand in
front of the gipsy i heard enough to
satisfy me as fiction if you have facts
to tell i want them have you a
message for me

  i have a message for a man it he
be brave answered boris watching
him narrowly it will need bravery
to obey the summons i bring signor
tommy stamped his foot impatiently
and i saw that the man who faced him
gathered his feet under him

  this is nonsense boris he said
angrily i am willing to reward a


the popular magazine

faithful messenger ami it is my busi-
ness whether i act or not after the
message is delivered let me have it
the tzigane held out his hand signifi-
cantly

  it must be crossed with money-
much money signor he said half
fawning half impudent tommy was
looking him fairly in the eyes an ex-
pression on his face such as i had not
seen in many a day

   boris you are a lying thieving ras-
 cal he said contemptuously i
 should not believe any message which
 came from your lips for i read kna-
 very in your eyes what black magic
 you practise with your music that it
 makes men see visions i do not know
 but the time for chicanery and cheating
 is over now you will tell me all that
 i want to know or i shall practise my
 own art on you the tziganes eyes
 did not drop but remained steadfastly
 fixed on his questioner i was watch-
 ing them both narrowly for i expected
 that tommy would seize him by the
 throat and i saw the hand which had
 been extended for money slowly with-
 drawn every movement of the man
 was as lithe as those of a panther and
 before i realized what he was up to the
 hand slipped under his jacket he was
 on his feet in a twinkling and a vi-
 ciotis-looking knife was poised for a
 thrust

   it was done so quickly that i had no
 time to draw my pistol and tommy
 was entirely unprepared but there was
 a sharp report from the rocks above us
 and the knife fell to the ground for
 a moment the gipsy was motionless and
 then as a small red spot appeared in
 the center of his forehead he suddenly
 crumpled and fell in a limp heap at
 tommys feet tommy stood motion-
 less for a moment but the tragedy re-
 called the warnings against the mafia
 vividly to my mind ami jumping for-
 ward i seized him anfilrew him back
 to the shelter of the rocks

   theres no sense in making an easy
mark of yourself i exclaimed angrily
there are more bullets where that
came from and you know that they are
sent to kill

  they could have killed us any tijne
this last three hours he answered and
he spoke like a man dazed a mo-
ment more and i should have had that
man absolutely in my power but now
he is dead and his message is unde-
livered the sound of his own voice
seemed to rouse him from his bewilder-
ment and his eyes flashed angrily as he
looked at the body of the gipsy

  the man who did that will have to
reckon with me  he snarled and his
face was not pleasant to look at you
can come with me or go back but 
am going to run him down me had
drawn his pistol as he spoke and before
i could restrain him he darted again
into the open space and started clam-
bering up the rocks to the place the
shot had come from it seemed abso-
lute madness but  had been through
too much with tommy to leave him in
the lurch and i followed finding at
least relief in action after hours of un-
easiness and anxiety

  i fully expected that we should be
shot at during that climb in which we
were absolutely without shelter but
not a sound came from above and we
gained the top without having been mo-
lested we dropped over a wall oi
rock which formed a natural rampart
onto a level grassy patch a perfect
miniature fortress with a path winding
back from it to the broken ground
above but whoever had been concealed
there had escaped tommy gave a cry
of disappointment and clambered to a
higher rock at the side from which he
could get a view of the mountain back
of us a moment later i was at his
side and tried to pull him back as a
half-dozen shots rang out from above
us but he shook me off impatiently

  they are not after us he said
the brutes are trying to hag that
girl the men who were doing the
shooting were invisible to us but a
half-mile to the left we could see the
bright-colored skirt and bodice which
the contadina girl had worn she was
dodging from rock to rock taking ad-
vantage of every bit of shelter which
they afforded and running across the
open spaces like a frightened deer it
the mafia and the contessa



was apparent that she was trying to
reach the point where the mountain
dropped in a sheer cliff to the sea and
the shots were coming- from above her

  if she reaches that point shell be
safe said tommy who knew the
country about palermo as he did his
pocket there are a dozen goat-paths
leading along the face of the cliff from
there and they cant get at her from
above go it little girl by jove
theyve got her no shes up again
run the shots told of at least a
dozen men concealed in the rocks above
her and once when she fell flat on her
face we thought that she had been hit
but it was evidently a trip for she was
quickly on her feet and racing forward
again we could do nothing to assist
her for the puffs of smoke which
alone betrayed the positions of the con-
cealed men were out of range of the
pistols we carried it did not seem
possible that she could escape but she
evidently knew every foot of the
ground she was traversing and she
never hesitated we watched her
breathlessly as she left the shelter of
the last rock to run across the ten yards
of open which lay betwreen her and
safety a flash of red and yellow in the
sunshine there was a perfect fusillade
of shots but she ran on until she wras
within a yard of the edge untouched
then a cry came from tommys lips
for just as safety seemed within her
reach she stopped her hands were
thrown above her head and she pitched
forward and disappeared from sight

  its a thousand feet sheer drop
there said tommy pityingly we
couldnt save her but there is such
a thing as retribution he dropped
back to the grassy place below and i
followed him sick at heart

   suppose its our turn now i said
as i looked down on the long path
which we must follow to reach the
safety of palermo tommy leaned
over and picked up something from the
grass

  we are either as safe as we would
be in our little beds or in spite of any-
thing we can do theyll get s inside of
the next half-hour he admitted see
here this is a union metallic car-
tridge company shell and it was made
in america

   here you tell me many members
of the mafia emigrate i answered and
he nodded as he slipped the shell into
his pocket

  yes and many of them come back
from there he answered this sa-
vors of the methods of the brotherhood
old chap but if we could prove it we
should prove the complicity of the po-
lice which has always been suspected
i looked at him inquiringly and he
pointed to the body of the gipsy be-
low s

  i believe that the bullet from this
shell is in his head he continued quiet-
ly i did not see the face of his mur-
derer  but i saw the pistol and the
hand which held it the pistol was a
colt automatic and on the third finger
of the hand on the grip was that curi-
ous seal-ring which you undoubtedly
noticed on the hand of cambioni yes-
terday afternoon

  then he fired to save you tommy 
i exclaimed and he looked at me skep-
tically

  the next half-hour should prove
whether he did or not he answered
gravely the only trouble is that if
you are mistaken in your guess the in-
formation will be of little practical
value to us

                  bahama bill the giant negro diver ol the seagull
                  learns that the value of a ships cargo may be in
                  direct proportion to its foulness and that the captain
                  of a whaler can be very mean and ungrateful

he sperm-whaler fly-
ing light came into
rio bay and anchored
near the seagull
wrecking sloop en-
gaged upon work in
the channel the
whaler was from new
bedford massachusetts and she was as
old as neptune dirty greasy oil-
soaked she had the blunt nose tum-
bling topsides and sawed-off stern of
the early types her wooden boat-davits
ranging along her bulwarks giving her
a most top-heavy and peculiar appear-
ance her small boats were however
being put in fine condition and showed
in marked contrast to her sea-washed
topstrakes bare of paint and spotted
with tar some of her seams spilling
oakum and leaving irish pennants hang-
ing she looked as though she had seen
much work and trouble and as her
skipper enoch brown told of twro
years at sea with varying luck in the
chase it was easy to believe that she
had indeed become one of the sea-god s
own

 we ben aout naouw erbout twenty-
five month said captain brown talk-
ing to captain blye of the seagull the
evening he came into port  n i reckon
we uns clamped daown erbout all but
a hundred barrel sparm-whales s
mighty sccerce in th pacific we
hunted the solan dor ground the mid-
dle ground n went clar up ter ther
pribilofs vans we done the nothe
atlantic the itatteras grounds an hit
ther luck mostly offn trinidad an ther

martin vas-struck inter er school o
young whales n cleaned up six hun-
dred bari an the best tiling o the
whole cruise was running over an old
bull a solitary sick old chap v
spewed up cr chunk o ambergris bout
sixty pound-worth fifty dollar an
ounce-thats it in that cask nigh ther
bulkhead i keep it lashed fast here
in the cabin sos i kin keep an eye on it
all the time you cant trust them da-
goes none too much portugee an
molaki all them fellers knows whats
what when it comes to values-you
think it stinks well i dunno-

  there dont seem to be much doubt
about that part of it assented blye
holding his nose and spitting in disgust
you say its worth fifty dollars an
ounce 

  i whunt say exactly but thats
erbout ther value they puts on it said
brown ennyhow its worth moren
fifty cr pound-en thatll make it come
to something like five or six thousand
dollars the old bull netted up no
moren forty barl-thin as blazes-
sick n thats what makes ambergris

  so i believe is the case said blye
i never was in a whale-ship but it cer-
tainly sounds interesting-picking tip a
few thousand dollars floating about on
the sea like that id like to have you
to dinner with me aboard my little ship
you come over just as you are and
have a good fresh feed of fruit and
beef ive a stewardess who can cook
a meal thatll make your mouth water

  naouw  dont mind ef i do capn
i dont mind ef  do-thank ye kindly

tll jest step forrard an tell mr wilson
crbout it-then ill drop in on yer jest
as  am-youll allow a coats too warm
daouwn hereabouts

  dive rowed him aboard his own ship
and bahama bill his master diver and
mr johnson formerly master of a four-
mated bark and now mate of the sea-
gull came to the side to inspect the
visitor the few men who ran the
pumps of the diving-outfit were more or
lss interested but sat about the fore-
castle miss moore the stewardess
served a meal that made the old whale-
mans appetite go in jumps and the ex-
cellent ale blye had purchased from a
tramp steamer at rio washed it down
and loosened up the chords of speech
when they came on deck under the
awning to smoke the subject of treas-
ure-hunting among the leviathans of the
southern ocean was in full blast and at-
tracted the attention of all

  naouw you see said the whale-
man you whunt strike ile sometimes
for months but always you have that
feeling in you that some day youll hit
it good and plenty with the expectancy
of grease there were a fellow from
wauchusett one from cohasset and an-
other from nantucket-

  bahama bill listened with a queer
smile to the accounts of the whaleman
he wanted to see the stuff that was so
valuable and when the skipper wanted
to go back aboard his ship the big negro
diver rowed him over

  mighty interesting line ob talk dat
what you dun give toe us capn said
he as the small boat drew up alongside
n id take it mighty kind if yo cud
show me some ob dat stuff-some ob
dat grease yo tell erbout being so hard
to find an so priceful

  the skipper took him below and al-
lowed him to examine the stinking
mass which he kept in a keg lashed in
a corner of his room bahama bill
looked at it long and wonderingly

  sho is mighty nasty stuff capn-
what make hit worth so much

   dunno exactly but they make it up
into fine perfume most fine ladies use
it for all the best perfumes have it for
a base lo plant the other stinks on

     

say for instance your lady want roses
she gits a bottle of perfume with a
few drops of this stuff diluted in sper-
rits an the rose smell is planted on it
so to speak-see thats all i knows
about it but the price is real it whunt
fall none to speak of answered the
skipper

   hit sho do seem like hitll hold hits
smell a long time en thats not say in
hits weak assented the diver looks
like jest a lump a nasty me-s of grease
from de beef-coppers-only harder like
i dun sailed in ships what served beef
wid de fat smeilin mos like hit vas
sare english ships-yo say yo find
hit in de sea test spewed up by
whales 

  naouw my man it is always from
sick whales healthy whales whunt
spew none up that i ever heard tell of
-whales what has it is mostly in the
latitudes of the martin yas that is
whales what ive found the stuff
floats and is picked up on the beach
sometimes why i knows a fellow
from cohasset-

  bahama bill listened to the deed of
the men from cohasset wachusett and
also from nantucket but while he
might have mixed them with the deeds
of men from mattapoisett amaganelt
apponagansett and other equally easily
remembered spots near new bedford
he always had in mind that ill-smelling
lump of ambergris the fetid product
of the bowels of a sick sperm-whale
there was no doubt at all as to the
value of the foul mass blye assured
him on that point for captain bh e had
often heard of the stuff and so had
hacksaw johnson although neither of
them had ever seen it before c  en-
cyclopedias of all sliip-librarie held ac-
curate and clear accounts of its value

and uses

  bahama bill rolled in the bunt of
the mainsail that night and dream 
about many disagreeable things
above all that foul lump of ambergris
the value had quite turned his head

  for several days following the sal-
vage of the submarine vessel the lhrrr

in the harbor of rio and very close to
he flying light the nearly full wliale-
ship which would soon be homeward
bound during this time the hairy
half-wild men ranged the beach of rio
and made tilings hot with their ex-
cesses whalemen arc not the gentle
kind-hearted sailors found in missions
or in crack packets their lives afloat
are under strict discipline arid they are
docile under the stern laws of ships at
sea where tlicv have no show at all to
advance themselves by any sort of mis-
behavior the capiain no matter what
happens is always on top with his
mates to back him and anything short
of absolute mutiny and complete piracy
results in the most terrific disciplining
complete possession of a ship by her
crew calls for their execution at their
first port of call and they must go in
sooner or later for water or food but
when ashore and free from the ships
rule their behavior is much as has
marked the south pacific islands with
lasting scars and for unrestrained bru-
tality and fearless crime the half-wild
men of the sea are not equaled any-
where on earth

  they were a wild-iooking set in the
flying light most of them were da-
goes from the western islands or
kanakas from the sandwich group
with some half-breeds from tahiti
they seldom wore anything more thin
a pair of dirty trousers and as water vs
not served to wash with in wdiale-ships
these articles of apparel were filthy the
stench on a still day upon the whalers
decks was not pleasant and the rancid
oil fermenting under the tropical sun
added charms lo the mixed odors which
put the smell of ambergris somewhat in
the nebulous with bare bodies hairy
and burned to a mahogany color tat-
tooed for the most part nearly all over
the chest and arms wilb their trousers
rolled to the knees their bare and dirty
misshaped feet padding about siiently
in the sunshine they truly resembled a
lot of half-human brutes some wore
shirts open at the neck half-way to the
waist but a pair of shoes was not to be
found outside the slop-chest bolted se-
curely to the deck in the captains room

    dun met up with some right smart
sailormen in my time said bahama
bill to johnson but fer de hardest set
ob white folks brown folks an  might
say yaller dem whale-lumlers is sho
de limit thirty monkeys is sho mo
to in taste ri thirty fellers like dem
dere n it seems toe me dat de skip-
per take a few chances wid dat grease
ire dun got slowed so safe an soun in
de after cabin ten ob dem men last
night lit on de guard at de docks and
ef yo wants tee -ee a dun-up set ob
soldiers yo sho ought to go in dere
an take a look at dem-nigh every one
got somethin n looks like dey sho
was handy wid dere hands an knives-
all got away wid hit too

  theyre tough propositions all
right assented johnson whaling
dont develop nothing soft in life but i
reckon the old manll look out for the
stuff hes got

  the whaleman from the states
sculled over the next day to report to
blye the amazing manner his men had
roughed the town-front of rio from
the sullen and silent seamen of the
deep ocean they had suddenly developed
into fiends with the inherent traits of all
mixed crews the traits the skipper
knew very well and dreaded according-
ly when he was in port where his iron
rule was not to be exercised as upon
the sea

  it whunt do at all it whunt do
captain blye said he i got to get
grub and water here and i got to sell
that stuff aboard or run the risk of
losing it before clearin again-what the
hell would you do about it

  nothing but get busy and get out
before you have more trouble said
blye

  wall naouw i duhnt know-i i
duhnt know-o course ill be delayed
some by this affair oh yes ill have
to pay blackmail according to hoyle an
set them dagoes right before i can get
out again but you see i got to go
ashore myself and i duhnt like the idee
o leavin this grease aboard where them
men can get a whack at it just so
much likker an then there may or
maynt be something doing
a keg of ambergris



  well if you want to you can bring
the stuff aboard the seagull well
take care of it for you until you get
ready for sea again said blye

  the whaleman eyed him curiously
lie had not meant to get any such ad-
vice any such suggestion at all what
he wanted was for blye to go ashore
and try to smooth out the matter of
the rough-house between his crew and
the authorities he was a suspicious
old seamanand he was silent for a time
after lilve spoke and the skipper of the
seagull knew what he was thinking
about and was more or less ruffled ac-
cordingly blye had-always played fair
to be even suspected of a possible
crooked pla i was always gall to him
he turned away and drew his chair to
the other side of the quarter-deck and
left the uncouth whale-hunter gazing
after him with that unmistakably sus-
picious twinkle in his faded but ex-
tremely keen eyes

  i duhnt want to hurt your feelings
my old friend but you see wilson has
a share in the stuff and i cant be re-
sponsible for it said he seeing how
blye felt about it wilson you know
is my mate-been in the ship three voy-
ages and ow ns a sixth interest in her
-you see how it is-

  blye smoked silently and gazed out
over the harbor he was somewhat ruf-
fled and took no pains to hide it his
manner told plainly that the whaleman
could take his ambergris and go to the
devil with it for i he cared

  bahama bill lay in the bunt of the
mainsail and grinned at the talk

   pear like dat whale feller dont
trust none ob us toe much said he to
johnson i reckon deres somethin
in dat find ob grease after all

ii

  aboard the whale-ship the heat was
so intense that even under the small
awning that wilson the mate had
stretched athwart the quarter-deck the
seams bubbled until the pitch seemed as
though it would run off like water the
second mate suudstrom came up the
ladder for during the skippers absence

he felt that certain rights he sometimes
respected might be thrown aside wil-
son sat at great ease in his stocking-
feet a small terrier dog chased the
flies from his socks where they rested
upon the skylight coaming and wilson
eyed the animal amiably noting his in-
tentions sundstrom came toward him
familiarly and drew up a stool which
the captain kept for his personal use
when aboard

  sile said the second flicking a
bug from the mates dirty collar tve
been below trying to clean up a bit-
dun chased the bugs and roaches from
the forward cabin with that stinking
brimstone--v while i was there i seen
that keg o grease i dunno what to
think but sure mike theres going to
be trouble if the old man keeps it
where the men ken git hand to ii-i
dont just like the way them dagoes
shows up after the run on the beach
well what yer goin to do erbout
it asked the mate want me to
put the whole crew in irons while the
skipper stays gamming erbout with all
the dude seamen afloat 

  naw i dont want nothin o the
kind sile but if you have a share in
the stuff im telling you you better put
it away somewheres better git your
half an lace it down safe like-what
you think

  i aint got no time fer thinking-
whos a-goin to run this vessel if i
stops to think-whos a-goin to sec we 
git new braces whos a-goin to see we
git new lanyards fer the fore riggin
whos a-goin to see we git grub to eat
if i sit around and think all day hey r
 was jest a-telling yoti said the
second reduced to a state of proper
awe at the manifest duties of his su-
perior  was jest a-telling you sile
an if the stuff goes dont say i didnt
say so in time whalin aint what it
used to be-you know that--and if you
lose out thisvoyage you aint goin on
another soon	 

  fergit it said wilson amiably
puffingslowly at his pipe whats the
use of taking life so hard ain t we
almost full of ile if you got the bugs
out of my room ill go and turn in after
 

ihh popular magazine

	inner and dont let no one turn me out
i til supper unless its the old man him-
self

  the sun was sinking behind the
mountains before the old man thought
of coming back aboard and in the mean-
time the mate slept in his cleaned bunk
and the second dozed upon his chest in
his room with the little dog near him

  forward the men lay and rested
some under the whale-boats bottom up
on the dock where repairs were being
made and others in the stinking close-
less of the forecastle where the whale-

oil	lamp burned eternally partly to fur-
nish light but mostly to furnish fire
for tlu reeking pipes two men from
the azores sat close under the port rail
and smoked in silence one of these
was a hairy fellow half-naked long of
limb and swarthy as a dago can be-
come after a year under the tropic sun
he was ugly with small glinting eyes
which were not resting at all like the
body stretched in the waterways black
whiskers covered the hard lines o- his
face and dirt and grease caked his
seamed neck large devices tattooed
upon his breast and arms offset the
otherwise common muscularity of his
fram his shipmate sat hunched up
with his arms around his knees and
whispered now and again through black
and stubby teeth grinning often and
looking aft the slanting rays of the
setting sun faded slowly out the sea
took  a darker hue

  nw  said the shorter seaman who
still sat watching

  they made their way aft so quickly
that no one saw them as they entered
the after cabin down the companion-
way they slipped with the agility of a
pair of cats and in less time nan it
takes to tell it they were upon the keg
containing the ambergris

  brcaka da kag-quick taka da
grease whispered the shorter one

  but breaking the keg was not so easy
it resisted the efforts of the dago to
such an extent that ik found it neces-
sary to strike it a heavy blow lie
finally did this with the butt of the
skippers whale-gnti which stood in a
rack on the bulkhead the shock sent

down the hammer upon the cap and a
terrific roar followed the charge tear-
ing n into the deck overhead the
auttiy aroused the little dog first and it
broke into a furious barking then
followed the second mate who awoke
with the full appreciation of the affair
upon him calling jo wilson he
rushed for the after cabin just as giu-
seppe and menriquez sped up the steps
of the companionway with something
tucket  under the latters arm

  halt you holy son if belial yelled
wilson throwing a belaying-pin with
the accuracy developed from long prac-
tise the pin hit hcnriquez fairly in
the back the pain was intense but
lie held onto his prize and limped awk-
wardly to the rail

  jump jump-taka da swim yelled
the shorter man giuseppe and hen-
riquez waiting  t an instant plunged
or rather fell overboard with a splash
he was followed by his shipmate who
made a clean dive and came to the sur-
face three or four fathoms distant

  all hands yelled wilson running
forward again get down the port
quarter boat

  shes on dec  h two strokes out
of her-fixin her up you know said
the cooper coming aft

 git me a whale-gun-quick
roared wilson

  no one went for a weapon and in the
meantime the two men were swimming
rapidly away with the tide cutting
slantwise for the lower pointfulich was
thickly wooded wilson dived below
and in a few moments came back with
a gun used for firing a bomb into the
back of a sperm-whale it was an im-
mense affair and very heavy he poured
a good handful of powder into its muz-
zle and shoved a bomb down upon it
then he hooked the pivot outside the
taffrail to keep back the recoil and cut
loose at the two heads which were now
some distance astern and going very
fairly toward the shore and safety
there was a smashing report the gun
flew up and drove wilson half-way
across the deck with it and the missile
threw tip the foam within si inch s of
i-ienriquez head but that was all
a keg of ambergrs



  sorry sir but there aint no other
boat whats fit to go-all of them being
overhauled sir the old man has the
only boat thatll swim you see we
smashed two off the martin vas after

that old bull n one oil-

  name o saints have i gut to stand
here and see two sons of the devil
swim away with a fortune yelled
wilson

  the report of the whale-gun echoing
across the harbor aroused the interest
of bahama bill who was just getting
the boat ready to take the wnaling-
skipper back aboard- his ship hack-
saw johnson came on deck and with
captain blye gazed long and studiously
at the affair on the whale-ship

  it was too far away to see things
definitely in the failing light but all
agreed that something was wrong
aboard and that the old man had better
get back to his vessel without delay
johnson and bahama bill volunteered
to row the boat

  i whunt git thar none too soon bul-
lies said the captain seating himself
aft pull like hell

  there were only two oars in the boat
the long one with which the skipper
sculled over to the seagull and a short
one johnson took up the short one
and bahama bill taking the long one
for stroke gave way with a will while
captain enoch brown directed and
cheered them with words of advice
port a small mite-thar thats it
naouw s-tabbard some stabbard some-
jest a small bit moar-steddy steddy
as you go-i duhnt give a damn so
long as i git thar in time to see thet

grease is all lo the good- good

gawd-

  the last exclamation came suddenly
as bahama bill swinging with full
power upon the stroke-oar snapped it
short off at the row-lock and the blade
quickly went astern he flung the rest
after it with an oath

  gimme sumthin datll hold a man-
gimme another oar-quick he called

  naouw thats all the oars i got
aboard said brown and whats worse
youve busted the lung one the short

ones too short to scull by-whatll we
do

  sing out fer another said bahama
bill standing up

  i he giant diver was just about to
bawl out for blye to send a small boat
when he became aware of the mate wil-
son waving wildly to him from the deck
of the whale-ship

  its mr wilson naouw i think he
whunt wait two minutes befoar swear-
in something rotten because we air
 here damn a mate who cant fit aout a
boat with more than a pair of paddles
-ill hail him said captain enoch
brown

  the uncouth mate was standing now
upon the taffrail waving his arms and
bawling something to his skipper
brown stood up in the small boat and
hailed him

   what dye want he yelled caynt
ye see we tins has lost an hoar-git a
boat over an come to us he yelled

   but the mate still waved and howled
gesticulating wildly like a crazy man

   he sho dun lose somethin n dais
a fact said bahama bilk most like
his liaid er what little sense hes got in
hit-whats that lies pointin to in the
sea

  two small black objects showed in
the direction of the irate mates out-
stretched arm he was now trying to
show brown the two swimming men
who were making a getaway with what
looked to be the ships treasure

  two fellers swimmin fer fair
commented bahama bill

  good lord-its the stuff my
grease groaned enochs brown
theyre making away with it-

   the giant diver gazed at the heads of
the swimming men now almost out of
sight in the little chop of the harbor
breeze the light was failing fast as it
does in the tropics after the sun goes
down and they stood a good chance to
get away without interference

   ill give you a share of it if you kin
git if said brown hoarsely you claim
to be a diver-caynt you swim too

  a little-maybe said bahama bill

  take a try said hacksaw john-
son grinning up at the big black


the popular magazine

  how much ycr say yo kin spare ob
dat stuff aked the diver

  ill give you an ounce a full ounce
-wuth fifty dollars said brown
quickly

  bahama bill at down upon the
thwart of the whale-boat then he
spat overboard in great disgust yo
sho is generous white man he com-
mented sourly captain blye was
watching the boat drifting without oars
and the stewardess miss moore hear-
ing the shouting came on deck also to
take a look she saw bahama bill sit
down and womanlike divined the cause
she could still hear the mate of the
whale-ship bawling about something
lost and she came to the quick conclu-
sion that it was the ambergris she liad
heard so much about in conversation
during the last few days visions of
profit came to her nimble mind sud-
denly she sprang upon the taffrail of
the seagull and screamed to bahama
bill to go after the men bahama bill
sat up straight and listened with a
broad grin upon his ugly mouth

  make hit a third n i goes n gits
hit said he slowly to enoch brown

  i whunt by gorry i whunt do no
sech thing-what ten thousand dollars
fer a little swim like that snarled the
wlialeman

  git hit yoself then snapped ba-
hama bill

  but miss moore was still screaming
to the diver in spite of blycs protesta-
tions to shut up suddenly bill sprang
up as if an idea had reached his in-
tellect he peeled off his jumper and
the next instant was over the side ma-
king a foaming path through the harbor
in the direction of the two heads which
had now almost gained the shadow of
the shore with a long-reaching over-
hand stroke the diver plowed through
it butting the small chop with his bul-
let-head and pushing up the foam in
front of him so high that it poured
over his face and shut off his wind un-
til the end of his stroke then getting
his nose nut for just an instant he
drove along again to repeat the move-
ment

  as an exhibition of fine swimming

the scene was hard to better the two
dagoes were experts in the art although
as a rule whalemen can swim but little
as nearly all deep-water seamen are the
poorest of men when in the element
upon which they spend so much of their
lives henriquez and his companion
were taking it easy now feeling that
they had made their getaway and that
they would soon be upon the wooded
point where shelter could be had the
growing night would cut off all pursuit
on land for it would be impossible for
any one but a native to trail them
througbjhe thick jungle the small
boats were out of commission and they
grinned and joked at each other as they
swam along commenting upon the dis-
tress caused their commander

  it was a good mile to the beach and
they were getting close in when they
were aware of a deep snorting close be-
hind them it was the sound of some-
thing in the jea and whatever it was it
was coming along with a wash and tear
like a giant fish henriquez treaded
water for an instant to get a better
view astern then the black head of
bahama bill came into view about ten
fathoms behind and the snoriing be-
came painfully distinct lie was com-
ing along handsomely and had sighted
his chase

  geta da nig panted henriquez
taka da knife-here

  cornin lika da whale hey-pity da
harpoon not here-i feex heem wida da
lance-what 

  giuseppe slacked his stroke he was
used to fighting and a negro more or
less was nothing to him he would at-
tend to the fellow and henriquez would
keep along with the prize getting into
the shoal water and darkness

  in a few moments bahama bill was
up with him

  the black head of the giant diver
rose suddenly lifted clear of the sea
and he stopped swimming the dago
waited warily and suddenly made a pass
with the knife

  bahama bill sank slowly down as the
weight of the blow feil upon his neck
he was not expecting a knife-thrust
and the blade had all but caught him in


a keg of ambergris

a vital place as it was the point
overreached him and the edge cut him
but slightly-his impetuous advance
had saved him by a fraction of an inch
lie sank beneath the surface and then
quickly swam deeper then he reached
for the fellows feet he grasped one
and with it fast in a powerful grip he
started for the bottom of the harbor
dragging the dago with him

  giuseppe felt the grip knew it was
the black man and thinking he had
killed him with the knife-thrust imag-
ined that the negro was sinking and
dragging him down to the bottom with
him lie therefore made no effort to
cut away but gave one yell to henriqtsez
for help and then went under

  down slowly down the black diver
dragged his victim three fathoms
deep he drew him with mighty strokes
and then the bottom mud struck his
hand lie let go and shot upward and
in a moment was breathing upon the
surface waiting for the head of the fel-
low to appear again again and again
did he drag the rascal down letting him
go only when his own wind was failing
and at the third sinking giuseppe failed
to rise again in a few moments bill
was after henriquez following the di-
rection in which he had seen him swim-
ming before his fight the tide was
now flooding and the current was set-
ting back toward the seagull hen-
riquez hearing the snorting breath of
bahama bill coming close asiern of
him knew the fate of his shipmate
knew that a like fate awaited him for
he was unarmed and bahama bill
would probably have the knife he let
go the ambergris and with overhand
strokes put for the shoaling water with
all speed

  he was a fine swimmer and the negro
was badly winded from his race and
fracas away they went through the
dark shore water their wakes rippling
off like the sea from a boats cutwater

  i dun got yo slack up yo dago n
gimme a share ob dat grease called
bahama bill

  i giva da knife-i keel you
shouted henriquez frantically at the
same time driving with all speed for the



point which was getting close the
black shadows were almost to him and
he strove to gain them hoping to elude
the diver in the darkness but the sea
was smooth inside the point and while
it was dark close to the land the smooth
surface gave back a rustle and swash as
he tore through it and the pursuing
swimmer could keep him well in mind

  straight for a jutting ledge swam
henriquez if he could gain it all
would be well for he couid surely hide
in the jungle behind him came the
diver panting snorting like a grampus
but keeping steadily at his work hen-
riquez feet struck the ground he gave
a mighty lurch ahead grabbed a pro-
jecting ledge and hauled himself clear
of the sea before bahama bill who now
fairly lifted himself from the water at
each stroke could reach the ground
with his legs

  i come back to keel you-black nig-
ger man panted henriquez then he
plunged into the bushes and bahama
bril tore his way through the shallow
and made the land at last

  a quick dash into the brush scratched
the naked body of the diver sorely he
stopped and listened there was not
a sound not a crackling of a twig to
show the direction of the escaping hen-
riquez he knew the fellow was close
at hand in the bushes but the dark-
ness was now that of a tropical night
and he could see nothing at all save the
outer edge of the jungle where the
lapping of the sea was all that broke
the stillness

  come out yo rascal come out an
give me a whack at yo he yelled
the silence was unbroken and he gazed
out over the harbor to see the riding-
light of his ship shine out over the
water captain blye had evidently re-
mained aboard

  i dunno as theres enny use er try-
in toe git that dago commented the
diver after ten minutes search in the
jungle  n when i comes toe think oi
hit i sho dont call toe mind seeing him
take nothin asbo with him-i reckon
he dropped de stuff somewheres befo
he landed he spent half an hour
searching the shore for a trace of the


the popular magazine

missing prize and then he wondered at
not having- a boat sent after him

  hits sho strange-hit sho is dat
dey sho ought toe send a boat-looks
like i dun got toe swim back abod
just then the sound of muffled oars
came to him then the voices of men
and he recognized that of enoch
brown captain of the whal-ship

  well i whunt give rnoren two
ounces of that grease no sir  whunt
give up the profits of a voyage jest to a
nigger-it aint fair no sir it aint
right to expect me to-heres this giu-
seppe half dead got him just in time-
heres henriquez killed likely before

this-i lose two good men-

  better wait till you get the stuff be-
fore you talk about giving it away
said the voice of johnson and if i was
you i wouldnt let on too much what
you think of bahama bill-or there
might be more men tost to your stinking

ship-

  here i am-come right in hailed
bahama bill from the darkness of the
shore and the boat was headed instant-
ly for the beach

  get him asked johnson

  i rcckon you got the stuff in-
quired brown

  got nothin-v i aint lookin no
mo for nothin-yo kin lake me back
abod said the diver

  sure you haint got that grease hid
in the bushes asked brown anxious-
ly

  i may have to take your whurd
yaas i can do that-but ill search the
pint in the morning jest the same
look here white man vo cut dat
line ob talk out-i aint got yo grease
but i makes plain dat ef i had got hit

while im talking toe yo ill jest make
hit plain dat yo is de meanest white
man i ever see

  get aboard-look out dont step on
giuseppe hes laying there in the bot-
tom-you nigh killed him said john-
son and bahama bill giving the boats
bow a shove jumped into her to row
back aboard his ship they took cap-

tain brown back to the whaleman and
passed the half-insensible seaman up the
side to the mate who immediately be-
gan to belabor him for stealing the
rize then johnson and hill rowed
aek aboard their little vessel blye
met them at the gangway and grinned
in amusement but miss moore stood
aft gazing forward at something in the
water with the night glass

  let her drift back a bit-let go now
row straight ahead said the steward-
ess its coming straight with the tide
the breeze had fallen as it always
does in the  tropical harbor and the
smooth dark water fhowed a small ob-
ject floating along with- the insetting
current- the men in the boat had hard-
ly grasped the meaning of the womans
curiosity when the lump of ambergris
came under the bow sprit-end

  quick for heavens sake dont lose
it cried the woman and johnson who
was forw ard made a pass for the mass
with both hands grabbing it and haul-
ing it aboard the small boat all was
done so quickly that the men were
amazed

  ive been watching it for an hour or
more said miss moore i knew the
fellow would drop it when bill started

for him-dear old bill-

  cut dat line out snapped the diver
  but you see you would never have

gotten it except for me-

  well well have to take it back to
the fellow to-morrow said blye we
are not whalemen or pirates

  but just a little-cant i have just a
little bit asked the stewardess

  i sho thinks miss mo has got toe
have a little piece-erbout one ounce or
so said bahama bill turning to his
captain

  all right you can cut off a chunk of
the stuff-cut off a couple of hundred
dollars worth but no more-and that
under the condition that you will take
the stuff back to the ship in the morn-
ing said blye

  i dunno as i would like ennytlnng
better-sho ill take de stuff back toe
dat man in de mornin-jest toe hear

synopsis of chapters previously published

     francis the young man who tells this story in his quest for fortune in the west finds himself almost
penniless and without prospects in baker city he is lodging at tho laughlin house the proprietor tells
him the story of the lost cabin mine up to date it seuma three prospectors had struck it famously rich
in the mountains and had then run out of food two of them bad made a desperate etiort to get back ti
civilization but had dropped on the way mike canlan another prospector had come across one of thim
half-conscious on the wagou-road to baker city and started to carry him there on the way he met apache
kid a picturesque western character and larry donoghue his partner a desperate violent fellow these
two had volunteered assistance they bad brought the dying man to the laughlin house while canlan
had gone for a doctor the man had muttered something about the lost cabin and apache kid and larry
donoghue had heard when canlan had returned the man was dead evidently canlan too had learned
something valuable for from that time he watched apache kid and donoghue like a hawk and tried in vari-
ous ways to find out how much they really knew francis meets the three of them at the laughlin hou-
donoghue tries to kill canlan and francis is instrumental in preventing the murder afterward apache
kid and donoghue propose to francis to join them in a contemplated trip offering him a salary he sorely
needs he accepts their olfer apache kid and he leave baker city as secretly as possible they are to
meet donoghue on the road to camp kett le apache kid does not divulge the object of their journey but
the precautions taken suggest to franci it is the search for the lost cabin mine at a half-way house
francis protects the daughter of the proprietor from the insults of a traveling man the latter attempts
to shoot him but apache kid saves his life they resume their journey by stage to camp kettle arriving
there apache kid tells francis definitely their destination is the lost cabin they procure horses and
rations and strike through the woods two men who have followed them hold them up in the forest and
demand to be told the location of lost cabin mine on penalty of death apache kid parleys with them
donoghue suddenly appears and shoot one of the men from behind a tree apache kid kills the other
thf three resume the journey -mr pinkerton proprietor of the half-way to kettle house and a half-breed
follow their rrail and warn them of another party coming to stalk them to the lost cabin and then kill
them this party now appears and in a pitched battle francis is captured by the enemies they torture
him cruelly to make him divulge the location of the lost cahin which he does not know finally apache
kid rescues him by agreeing to join forces with the other party and all go into camp together for the night

hat the were three
unscrupulous scoun-
drels-the toughest
greasers that ever stole
stock as mr pinker-
ton had phrased it
when speaking of them
and their cronies-
u-ing the word greater in its loose
slang sense not necessarily implying
thereby that they were actually mexi-
can- which is the meaning of the name
-that they were capable of any treach-
ery and cruelty themselves there was
no doubt and as they were so they
would be very prone to judge others

and were doubtless already thinking
to themselves that we three had after
all-for the present at least-the best
of the bargain  for had they set upon us
and done away with us where would
have been their chance of coming to the
lost cabin as far away as-ever the
lost cabin would still have been a
needle in a haystack

  on the other hand i guessed them
already arguing we would be glad and
even eager to kill them though they de-
sired to keep us alive-for a time

   suppose they took our handshake-
larrys and mine-for a sign of some
understanding between us and scented

the popular magazine

in it a treacherous design upon them
for they kept upon our hanks hereafter
at sight of which donoghue laughed
his ugly laugh and shook his horse for-
ward a step sneering at them over his
shoulder

  oh we were a fine company to go
into camp together a we did within
half an hour later before the last grass-
hoppers had ceased their chirring on
the side of the knoll where was a spring
of water a little pool overhung by a
rock with strange amphibious insects
darting away from its center to the
sheltering banks as we dipped our cans
for water to make the flapjacks

  to any chance observers happening
into our camp at twilight we would
have seemed nothing more dire than
a round-up camp of cowboys i fancy
for after the meal when pipes and
cigarettes were lit and belts let out a
hole or two and boots slackened there
was an air of outdoor peace around the
fire

  yet i need not tell you that the peace
was on the surface-fanciful unreal
as for me the snake was leaping in
my eyes out of the fire when apache
kid calmly struck up a song

  heads jerked up and eyes glanced
on him at the first stave it seemed as
though everything that any man there
could do or say was to be studied for
an underlying and furtive motive

  it was the spanish cavalier he
sang with a very fine feeling too soft-
ly and richly there is a deal of the
sentimentalist about me and the air
apart from the words was ringing in
my heart like a regret

  the bright sunny day he sang
it soon fades away and after he
ceased the plain had fallen silent the
chirring of insects had gone and left
the valley empty of sound during all
the journey i never heard so much as
the twitter of anv bird-except one of
which you shall hear later-so i think
that the gripping silence at the end of
day must have been due only to the
stopping of the insect life by day one
was not aware of any sound but at the
close of day when the air chilled the
silence was suddenly manifest

   then the singing ceased and the cry
that i now knew well the dusk cry of
the coyotes rose in a howl with three
or four yelps in the middle of it and
the doleful melancholy baying at the
close

   i looked round the group at the fire

again

   well said apache kid the first to
speak whos to niglft-herd the

horses 

  the man dan rose up at that it
was he who alone of all my tormentors
on the clift had spoken a word with
anything of kindness in it

   th take the first guard if you like
said he

   farrell looked across at apache kid

	one of your side then said he
can take the next guard-share and
share-time about i guess eh r

  apache kid threw the end of his
cigarette into the fire and drawing
out his pouch rolled another and mois-
tened it before he replied

  why do you talk about sides at
all he asked i thought we were a
joint stock-companv now

  well wrell snapped farrell i
mean one of you three-you or one of
your partners

  quite so i know what you mean
i understand our meaning perfectlv

  there was a pause and then said he
taking a brand from the fire and light-
ing liis cigarette so that i saw his full
healthy eye shine bright ii you are
going to talk about sides in this expe-
dition-then so be it but i dont think
our side as you call it will bother with
any night-herding indeed i think we
need hardly trouble about saddling up
or unpacking or cooking or anything-
if you make it a matter of sides and
lie blew a feather of smoke  think
my side will live like gentlemen between
now and the arrival at the lost cabin
aline

  every eye was fixed anxiously on
him

   you see he explained the fact is
you need us and we dont need you
its a case of supply and demand and
-seeing you talk of sides he said
with what must have been to farrell
lost cabin mine



an irritating- insistence our side ai
present is wanted its almost i sort of
example of the workings of capital and
labor no he ended with a satisfied
grunt i dont think theres any need
for me to tend horses at all thanks
im quite comfy by the fire

  there was a shrewd calculating loc k
on farrells face as he looked apache
kid cunningly in the eye a space i
could wager that he was making him-
self certain from this spcech that
apache kid was the principal in our ex-
pedition i think he really believed that
i could say nothing of the lost cabin
even had i desired to and from the
way he looked then to donoghue and
looked back again to apache kid it
struck me forcibly that he was wonder-
ing if it were possible that larry dono-
ghue was not in the know to the full
but merely of the company in a similar
way with myself

  then he rolled an eye back again to
apache kid and i remembered the
sheriff of baker city then for farrells
words were the very words i had heard
the sheriff use youre a deep man
he said

  and im quite comfy too broke in
donoghue thanks he added and
as for this young man beside me i
think he wants a rest to-night a man
thats had a snake wriggling at his nose
for half of an afternoon is liable to
want a little sleep and forgetting

  everybody cocked an ear so to speak
on this speech but no one of those
who did not understand asked an ex-
planation

  farrell looked with meaning at mr
pinkerton who sat out of the affair
but neither he nor ihe half-breed spoke
a syllable pinkerton pulling  his
corn-cob pipe and the half-breed rub-
bing the silver buckle of his belt with
the palm of his hand and studying the
reflection of firelight in it

  no no suddenly remarked apache
kid you couldnt ask mr pinkerton
to do that nor charlie either we
cant be so inhospitable as to ask our
guests of this evening to night-tend our
horses

  what the hell are you getting on

about said farrell and then as
though thinking better and considering
that a milder tone was more fitting lie
said i never asked them to

  no no you did not ask them to
said apache in a mock-conciliatory
tone and then with a smile on his lips
he said gently but you were thinking
that and i-know-every-thought-
that passes through your mind mr
farrell

  you should have seen the man pete
at these soft-spoken words

  i must give you an idea of what this
fellow looked like to begin with i
think i may safely say he looked like a
villain but moreof the wolf order of
the villain than the panther he had
what you-would call an ignorant face
-a heavy brow high cheek-bones very
glassy and constantly wandering eyes
far too many teeth for his mouth and
they very large and animailike and
if ever i saw superstitious fear on a
mans face it was on the face of that
cutthroat

  he looked at apache kid who sat
with his hat tilted back and his open
cheery and devil-may-care face ra-
diant to the leaping firelight-looked
at him so that the firelight made on
his face shadows instead of lighting it
for he held his chin low and the mouth
open his hat was off and only his
forehead was lit up the rest was
what i say-loose shadows then he
looked at farrell as though to see if
farrell were not at all fearful and
say he said ill take herd to-
night

  farrell turned on him with a leer and
laughed

  i guess youd better go first then
said he before midnight comes and
let dan go second after a three hours
tend

  so pete rose and tightened his belt
and went his ways and that in less than
no time for tiie horses were already
restive as though the loneliness of the
place had taken possession of them of
all beasts i know i think horses the
most influenced by their environment

  well if this dont beat cock-fight-
in i heard mr pinkertons voice be-


the popular magazine

hind me where he lay now leaning on
an elbow ami then he said a word or
two to the half-breed who rose and de-
parted out of the circle of the fire-
shine

  in a little space he returned leading
his own mount and pinkertons by the
ifiriau which were around their necks
and as he made fast these lariats to a
stone farrell looked at mr pinkerton
across the glow and asked him sus-
picious as ever whats that for

  oh just so as not to he indebted
to you replied pinkerton and coming
ciom r to the tire he rolled his one gray
blanket round him and knocking down
the ashes of his pipe lay down to rest
the half-breed following suit but after
they had iain down and when i a little
later at a word from donoghue sug-
gesting  should turn in unpacked
my blankets which i had found among
the pile of our mixed belongings i saw
the half-breeds eyes still open and with
no sign of sleep in them so said i
to myself pinkerton and the half-breed
i expect have arranged to share watch
and watch without having the appear-
ance of doing so

  and indeed one could scarcely won-
der at any such protective arrangement
in such a camp as this donoghue and
apache kid indeed were the only two
there who could close their eyes in sleep
that night with anything like a reason-
able belief that the chances of their
awakening to life were greater than
their chances of never breathing again
the sage-scented air of morning

chapter xiv

apache kid prop tkes

  you may wonder how it was possi-
ble for me to lie down to roll myself
round in my blankets to fall asleep in
such a camp in such company as that
i indeed wondered at myself as i did
so wondered how i came by the heed-
lessncss-for i cannot call it courage-
that allowed me to compose myself to
slumber anything might have hap-
pened in the dark hours murder and
sudden death but i was excessively

fatigued my body ached my nerves
too were unstrung by the torture of
the cliit sleep i mut and sleep i did
on the in-tant that  stretched myself
and laid down my head perhaps the
sigh with which  dismissed from my
mind the anxieties that might have kept
me wakeful was more of a prayer than
a sigh across the fire of smaller
branches that had cooked our supper
in the preparing of which each look
part a great log was laid so that no
replenishing would be necessary

  it was the sound of donoghues
voice that woke me to blue night star-
shine and the red glow of the log  i is
jxjsition was unaltered i could have
believed that he had not moved a mus-
cle since my lying clown and the stars
told me i had slept some time lie re-
clined with his legs crossed his feet
stretched to the glow his hands in his
pockets and his unloosened blanket-roll
serving for a cushion to the small of his
back

  there aint no call for me to turn
in he wras saying i dont have to
turn in to please you

  i smuggled the blankets under iny
chin and looked to see whom he was
addressing

  all the others of the company were
lyirvr down but it was evidently far-
rell who had made the prior remark for
he nuw worried with his shoulders in
his blankets to cast them from him and
rising on an elbow said oh no you
dont have to but it looks to me
mighty like as if you was seared of us
-that you dont lay down and sleep
were square enough with you

  donoghue looked at him in that n-
solent fashion of opening the eyes wide
and then almost shutting them and
sneered

  well well what are you always
cpenin your eyes up a little ways and
peepin at one for one would think
you was scared o me and that feller
there that dan or what you call hint
he keeps waking up and giving a squint
around too youre square with us
weresquare with you aint we r

  farrell flung the blankets back from
him and cried out do you know what
lost cabin mine



im goin to tell you i wouldnt trust
you not an inch i got my gun here
ready if you try any nonsense

  the gleam of an unholy satisfaction
was ou donoghues face then lie cried
out well sir if i find a man trust
me im square with him  but if he dont
trust me i doivt play fair with him
thats right  guess aint it

  this to my mind was a very faulty
morality but it seemed not so to far-
rell

  yes ie agreed i reckon thats
generally understood and then he
showed quite a turn for argument on
his own plane of thought

  cut you dont trust me neithei
said he and if i was payin you back
the way you talk about id up and plug
you through the head

  argument was not in donoghues
line but lie cried out

  and where would  be while you
were tryin it on

  farrell did not answer and in the
pause donoghue did indeed continue the
argument unwittingly to its logical
conclusion

  no no my boy he said you
wouldnt plug me here you wouldnt
plug me till we got you what you
wanted oh i know your kind well
you thought you held the trumps when
you corralled the lad there and he
jerked his head in my direction but
you didnt

  it seems to me like as we did said
farrell with a vindictive leer else why
are we here now

  iiee now snapped donoghue
why youre here because my partner
i so dumed soft times he wouldnt
-go-on-and leave the lad he
drawled contemptuously what good
was the boy to you anyhow  he asked
looks as if you knew you were try-
ing it on with a soft queer fellow id
ha let you cat the boy if you wanted
and jest taken a note o your ugly blue
mug in my mind and said to myself
larry my boy when -ou see that fel-
ler agin after youve got through with
this-you shoot him  sight

  and what if the mug was to follow
you up said farrell

  all this while there was no move-
ment round the fire only that i saw
apache kids hand drawing down ihe
blankets from his face pinkerton and
the half-bred were a little beyond
donoghue and lying somewhat back so
that  did not know if they were
awakened by this talk and just then
dan sat up suddenly glared out upon
the plain to the foil- points of the com-
pass and screamed out

  the bosses  wheres the bosses

  we were all bolt upright then like
jumping-jacks and leaning  our
palms and twisted about faring out
strained into the mooh-pnilid plain

  dan leaped to his feet

  the bosses is gone he cried and
he rushed across to the two horse- that
were tied with the lariats

  lend me a hoss he cried we
must go out and see where pete has
got to with them horses

  i lew you dis-you dog said the
half-bt-ed in his guttural voice and he
flung up his polished revolver in dans
face

  it was apache kid who restored
some semblance of order to the camp

  all right dan he said dont
worry its too late now

  we all turned to him in wonder

  fete thought it advisable to take the
whole bunch away lie agreed that it
was advisable to make what little capi-
tal he could out of his expedition into
this part of the country o the whole
i think he was sensible yes-sensible
is the word he said thoughtfully wag
ging his head to the fire and t-hen look-
ing up and beaming on us all

  what you mean cried farrell

  just what i sar said apache kid
he simply walked the whole bunch
quietly avvay five minutes after he
bunched them together out there

  you saw him doin that you saw
his game and said nothing cried far-
rell

  even so replied apache kid

  farrell glared before him speechless

  what in creation made him do
that  said dan going back like a man
dazed to his former place

  you mean vlw in creation made


the popular magazine

him do that  apache kid said lightly
and i have to acknowledge that it was
i

  you thundered farrell i didnt

see you say a word to him you bought
him utt someways did you how dim
you do it

  oh said apache kid i simply
gave him a hint of the terrors in store
for him if he remained here you heard
me and lie was a manwho could un-
derstand a hint such as i gave i took
him first as being easiest but i have
no doubt that you two also will think
better of your intention and depart-
before it is too late he went first
you mr farrell i think will have the
honor of going last

  i dont know what you mean said
farrell like a man scenting something
beyond him

  no said apache kid i under-
stand that -you will require some
other method used upon you he suf-
fered from the fear of man that was
why he went away now you farrell

i dont think you fear man god-

  no nor devil cried farrell
nor no more do i  said dan turn-
ing on apache kid nor no more do
i and if the loss o the bosses dont
cut any figure to you it dont  more
to us for were goin through with you
right to the end

  but  thought that a something about
his under lip as i saw it in the shadows
of the lire belied his strong statement
apache kid was of my opinion for lie
looked keenly in dans face and re-
marked a very good bluff daniel
dont you daniel me cried the
man youre gcttin too derned fresh
and frisky and gcttin to fancv vour-
self

  thats right a bluff should be sus-
tained said apache kid insolently
and then dropping the conversation as
though it were of absolutely no mo-
ment he rolled himself again in his
blanket and this he had no sooner
done-unconcerned untroubled heed-
less of any possible villainy of these two
men-than pinkertons voice spoke be-
hind me

  lies a good man spoiled is that

apache kid i could ha been doin
with a son like that

 think youre kind o a soft mark
right enough sneered farrell to the
now recumbent form of apache kid
i think youre too soft to scare me
apache kid was up in a moment
soft he cried soft

   and on his face was the look that he
gave the italian livery-stable keeper at
camp kettle only as the saying is
more so

  i heard donoghue gasp you would
have thought more in fear than in ex-
ultation say when he gets this 
ways you want to be back out of his 
way

   look at me said apache standing 
up you see ive got on no belt my 
guns lying there with the belt ive 
got  knife-nothing will yon stand
up sir and let me show you if im soft
seeing that i have given you my word
-not to kill you you should have
heard the way these last words came
from him will you stand up and let
me just hammer you within an inch of
your end

   farrell did rot quail i will do him i
that justice but he sat considering i
and then he jerked his head and jerked j
it again doggedly and no he said i
no i reckon not

  the fire of anger had leaped quick i
enough to life in apache kid and it j
seemed to ebb as suddenly

  ait right he said all right j
perhaps it is better so it would dirty
my hands to touch you and indeed
he was moving back to his place now
lead is too clean for you as well

  he turned a he reached where his
blankets lay

   farrell he said it is at the end of
a rope that you will die

chapter xv

in which the tables are turned-
at some cost

after that peace came and i dozed

again

   it was a shot followed by a scream
that awoke me and those kind gods
who guard us in our sleep and in our
lost cabn mine



  waking caused me even at that moment
  not to obey the sudden impulse to leap
  up instead i flung my hand to my
  revolver and lay flat-and in doing so
  saved my life

     beside me with the first quick open-
   ing of my eyes i saw donoghue kick
   in his blankets like a cat in a sack and
   then lie still and the second shut rang
   in my ears fired by the man dan from
   across the fire and aimed at me but
   truly it was fated that dan should go
   first of these two who remained with
   us of his side as farrell had called it
   and it was i who was fated to do the
   deed let me put it in that way i beg
   of you let me say fated in this in-
   stance if in no other for it is a terrible
   thing to slay a man and then i saw
   what had befallen-after mv shot had
   gone home and dan lay on his face
   where he had fallen-dead with the
   light of morning of a new day just
   quivering up the eastern sky and ma-
   king the thing more ghastly

farrell mid he must have quietly
whispered over their plan where they
lay-to make a sudden joint attack upon
 us dans part had evidently been to
put an end to larry and to me while
 farreii attended to apache kid for
i there was farrell now with a revolver

	in each hand and both were held to
j apaches kids head

at hearing my shot for a moment
farrell glanced round and seeing that
 dan had failed in his attempt he cried
i out if you move i kill apache kid
i here right off mind now i kill him

	-and let the lost cabin mine slide

	well see whos boss o this round-up
     and then it suddenly struck me as

  strange that they had not reckoned on
  the other two who were with us-mr
  pinkerton and the half-breed even as
  i was then considering their daring
  there came a moan from beside me i
  flung round at the sound and there lay
  pinkerton with his hand to his breast
  yes i understood now that sound
  that woke me was not of one shot it
  was two-dans first shot at larry and
  farrells at mr pinkerton but what
  of the half-breed i bent to mr pink-
  erton and with my hand under his neck

said oh mr pinkerton mr pink-
erton oh mr pinkerton can i do
anything for you 

  he looked upon me with his kind
eyes full of the last haze now and
gasped  my girl my girl you will

- and he leaned heavy in my arms

  i will sec to her aid i oh sir
tins you have got for us it is through
us that this has happened i will see
that she never wants

  these or some words such as these i
spoke-for i never could rightly recall
the exact speech in looking back on that
sad affair

  you-you are all right my son he
said but if apache kid gets out o

this-hes-hes more fit like for-

  i saw his hand fumble again on his
breast and thought it was in an attempt
to open his shirt but then i caught the
agony in his eye such as you may have
seen on a dumb man trying to make
himself understood and ailing in the
attempt something of that look but
more woful more pifeoi to see va-
on his face ite was trying to hold his
hand to me when i took it he smiled
and said

 you or apache-meg and that
was the last of this kindly and likable
man who had done so much for us

  but what of the half-breed was he
too slain not so but he was of a
more cunning race than i am sprung of
when i laid back mr pinkerton- head
and again looked around the half-breed
was gone from the place where he had
lain

  there on his belly almost he was
creeping upon farrell from the rear to
me it seemed the maddest and-most for-
lorn undertaking

  there was farrell with the two re-
volvers held to apache kid s head talk-
ing softly too quietly for me to hear
and apache kid replying in a low tone
without any attempt at rising and
parrell cried out nobody try to fire
on met at a shot i fire too my fin-
gers is jest ready im a desperate
man

  i crouched low my breath held in
dread my heart pounding in tnv side at
long intervals so that i thought it must
the pqpula magazine 

needs burst i did not even dare look
again at that crawling savage lest far-
rell might perhaps cast another such
quick glance as he had already bestowed
on me and seeing flic direction of my
gaze realize his danger

  the result of such a discovery i
dared not imagine there was enough
horror already without addition it
was just then that donoghue gave a
queer little wheezing moatt and his eyes
opened but even as  turned to him
crash  went a shot anti  spun round
a cry on my lips and there lay apache
kid as t hail seen him before dono-
ghues voice called me away from ob-
serving him but now lie had clutched
farrells right wrist in what must have
been a mighty sudden movement and
was pushing it from him he had
leaped sidewise a little way but with-
out attempting to rise

  there thrusting away in a firm
grasp the hand that held the smoking
weapon he still looked up in farrells
eye the other revolver before him so
that he must have looked fairly intoit

  you durn fool said farrell you
think i didnt mean what i said well
let me tell you that i run no more
chances oh you neednt grasp this
arm so fierce i dont have to use it
but apache kid fm goin to kill you
now i reckon that that there lost
cabin aint for any of us--not for you
for sure are you ready

  quite ready i heard apache kid
say his voice as loud as farrells now
but more exultant still it horrified me
to hear his voice so callous as he looked
on death i wondered if now i should
not risk a shot as a last hope to save
him

  there then cried farrell

  but there followed only the metallic
tap of the hammer-no report only that
steely click and before one could well
know what had happened apache kid
was the man on top shoving farrells
head down in the sand but still clutch-
ing farrells right wrist and turning
aside that hand that held the weapon
which m his first sudden movement
had sent its bullet into the sand beside
apache

  you goat cried apache kid
when you intend to use two guns see
that they both are loaded or else dont
hold the one that youve fired the last

from right in front of- lie broke

off and flung up his head like a wolf
baying and laughed

  he was a wxird sight then his face
blackened from the shot he had evaded
but by this time  need hardly tell you

i was by his side helping to hold down
the writhing farrell-and ihe half-
breed brought us the lariat from his
horse and we trussed farrell up hands
and feet and then stood up and as
we turned from him there was dono-
ghue sitting up with a foolish look on
his face and the blood trickling on his
brow and pointing a hand at us he
cried out come here some o you
sons-o-guns and tie up my head a bit
so i kin git up and see his hangin afore
i die

  farrell writhed afresh in his bonds
as he heard donoghues cry and in a
voice in which there seemed nothing hu-
man ik roared what is that feller
donoghue not killed

  no sir donoghue replied his
head falling and liis chin on his breast
but eyes looking up

  with the blood running into them
from under his ragged eyebrows no
sjr-after you lie cried and he let
out that hideous oath that  had heard
him use once before but cannot permit
myself to write or any man to read

chapter -xyi

sounds i the forest

  we hanged farrell in the morning
for he had broken the compact and he
was a murderer and we laid pink-
erton to his rest in the midst of the
plain with a cairn of stones to mark
the spot

  let that suffice as for these two
things you may readily understand 
have no heart to write and indeed it
would be a depraved taste that would
desire to read of them in detail 
know you are not of those who will
blame me for this reticence
lost cabin mine



  when i told apache kid of mr
pinkertons last words he was greatly
moved as i could see though he kept
a calm front and he told the half-
breed who left us then to convey to
miss pinkerton our united sympathy
with a promise that we would visit her
immediately on our return from our ex-
pedition

  then we set out again a melancholy
company as you will understand
apache kid and i carrying all the pro-
visions that lie thought lit to take along
with us for donoghue was too light-
headed to be burdened with any load
and lurched along beside us as we made
toward the hiils that closed in the plain
to north lurched along with the red
handkerchief around his head and sing-
ing snatches of song now and again
the bullet had plowed a furrow along
the side of his head and though the
bleeding had stopped he was evidently
mentally affected by the wound

  it was drawing near nightfall again
when we came to the end of this seem-
ing cul-de-sac of a valley and the hills
on either side drew closer to us

  before us now as we mounted
breathing heavily- up the incline we saw
the woods all the trees standing mo-
tionless and already we could look well
into the hazy blue deep of that place

  i have been here before said
apache but not much farther we
thought we might have to push clear
through this place and try what luck
there was in getting a shelter beyond
they pushed us very close that time
he said meditatively but so absently
did he speak this that though i could
not make any guess as to who it was
that was pushing him close and
who was with him on that perilous oc-
casion i forbore to question

  you have seen men in that mood
yourself i am sure speaking more to
the air than to you

  he turned about at the entering into
the wood and we looked down on the
plain stretching below us a long while
he gazed with eyelids puckered scan-
ning the shelving and stretching ex-
panse

  two parties have followed us he

said in a whisper almost god grant
there be  more else when we ga the
wealth that lies in store for us we shall
hardly be able to enjoy it for thinking
of all it has cost us it has been the
death of one good man already he
added ah well there is no sign
of any mortal there we must push on
through this wilderness before us

  he stopped again and considered
donoghue rocking impotent and dazed
beside us

  i wonder where canlan is to-night
he said and then we plunged into the
woods

  if the silence of the plain had been
intense we were now to know a silence
more august i think it was our envir-
onment then that made apache kid
speak in that whisper there was some-
thing in this deep wood before us that
hushed our voices i think it was the
utter lack of even the faintest twitter
of any bird where it seemed fitting that
birds should be that influenced us then
almost unconsciously our very tread
fell echoless in the dust of ages there
the fallen needles and cones of many
and many an undisturbed year it was
with a thrill that i found that we had
suddenly come upon what looked like a
path of some kind apache kid was
walking first donoghue following the
knotted ends of the handkerchief stick-
ing out comically at the back of his head
under his hat

  you see were onto a trail now
said apache kid as he trudged along
you never strike a trail just at the
entrance into a place like this travel-
ers who have passed here at various
times you see come into the wood at all
sorts of angles where the trees are thin
but after one gets into the wood a bit
and the trees get thicker in feeling
about for a passage you find where
some one has been before you and you
take the same way a week or a month
or a year later some one else comes
along and he follows you this trail
here for all that you can see the print
of a horses hoof here and there on it
may not have been passed over this year
by any living soul  here may not
have been any one here since i was here


the popular magazine

last myself three years ago-yes that
print there may be the print of my own
horses hoof for i remember how the
rain drenched that day charging
through the pass here and dripping
from the pines and trickling through
all the woods

  it is a pass then said i

  oh yes vie explained it is what
is called in the language of the coun-
try a bucks trail that does not mean
as i used to think an indian trail it
is the slang word lor a priest you
find these bucks trails all over the coun-
try they were made by the priests
who came lip from old mexico to evan-
gelize and convert the red heathen of
the land i think these old priests must
have been regular wander-fever men
to do it think of it man cutting a
way through these woods aha see
theres a blaze on a tree there you
can scarcely make it out though its
been rained upon and snowed upon and
blown upon so long year in year out
turn about now that we arc past it
and you see the blaze on this side per-
haps the old man made that himself
standing back from the tree and swing-
ing his ax and saying to himself  if
this leads me nowhere i shall at least
be able to find my way back plain
enough well its near here some-
where that i stopped that time three
years ago do you make out the
sound of any water trickling

  we stood listening but there was no
sound save that of our breathing and
then suddenly a tap tap tap broke
out loud in the forest so that it startled
me at the moment though next mo-
ment i knew it was the sound of a busy
woodpecker

  we moved on a little farther and
then apache kid cried out in joy

  aha here we are see the clear
bit down there where the trees thin
out

  we pushed our way forward to
where through the growing dusk of the
woods there glowed between the trunks
a soft green seeming very bright after
the dark rusty green of these motion-
less trees

  there isnt much elbow-room round

about us here to keep off the wildcats
said apache kid looking round into the
forest as we stepped forth into this
oasis and found there a tiny spring with
a teacupful of water in its hollow

  the little trickle that went from it
seemed just to spread out ami lose it-
self almost immediately jn the earth
but it served our purpose and here we
camped

  donoghue had been like a dazed man
since morning but now after the strong
tea he was greatly refreshed and had
his wits collected sufficiently to suggest
that we should keep watch that night
lest another party were following us
up he also washed the wound in his
forehead and finding it bleeding afresh
after that pricked what he called the
pimples from a fir-tree and with ihe
sap exuding therefrom stanched the
bleeding again and i suppose used one
of the best possible healers in so doing

  that there were wildcats in the woods
there was no doubt they screamed
half the night with a sound like weep-
ing infants very dolorous to hear
apache kid took the first watch dono-
ghue the second and i the third i was
to waken them at sunrise and alter
donoghue shook me up and i sat by the
glowing lire i remember the start with
which i saw after a space as  sat
musing of many things a one will
muse in such surroundings two gleam-
ing eyes looking into mine out of the
woods-just the eyes upright ovals
with a green light turning suddenly
into horizontal ovals and changing color
to red as  became aware of them

  we were generally careful to make
our fire of such wood as would flame
or glow without shedding out sparks
that might burn our blankets but some
such fuel had been put on the fire that
night and it suddenly crackled up then
and sent forth a shower of sparks and
at tiiat the eyes disappeared i flicked
the sparks off my sleeping comrades
and then sat musing again looking up
on the stars and alternately into the
darkness of the woods and into the glow
of the lire and suddenly i saw all
along the forest a red line of light
spring to life
lost cabin mine



  i saw it climb the stems of trees far
through the wood and run up to the
branches a forest fire thought i to
myself and wondered if our danger
was great in that place i snuffed the
air there was certainly the odor of
burning wood but that might have
been from our camp-fire alone and
there was also the rich unforgettable
odor of the balsam

  cut so greatly did the line of fire
increase and glow- that i stretched forth
my hand and touched donoghue upon
the shoulder he started up and fol-
lowing the pointing of my finger
glared a moment through the spaces of
tiie forest then he dropped back again

  it is the dawn he said and drew
the blankets over his head wake me
in another hour

  but i sat broad-awake my heart
glowing with a kind of voiceless wor-
ship watching that marvelous dawn
it spread more slowly than i would
have imagined possible taking tree by
tree running left and right and creep-
ing forward like an advancing army
and then suddenly the sky overhead
was full of a quivering pale light and
in the dim blue pool of the heavens the
stars went out but no birds sang to
the new day only i heard again the
tap-tap of a woodpecker echoing about
through the woods

  so i filled the can with water which
was a slow process at that very tiny
spring and mixed the flour ready for
the flapjacks and then woke my com-
rades

  i must not weary you however re-
counting hour by hour as it came i
have other things to tell you of than
these-matters regarding hasty hot-
blooded man in place of a chronicle of
slow benignant nature

  on the journey of this day we came
very soon to what seemed to be the
height of land in that part and de-
scending on the other side came into a
place of swamp where the mosquitoes
assaulted us in clouds so terribly did
they pester us that on the midday
camp while apache kid made ready
our tea-for eatables we did with a
cold flapjack apiece having made an

extra supply at breakfast so as to save
time at noon-i employed myself in
switching him about the head with a
leafy branch in one hand while with
the other i drove off another cloud of
these pests that made war upon me

  no sooner had we the tea ready
than we put clods and wet leave- upon
the fire raising a thick smoke a
smudge as it is called and sitting in
the midst of that protecting haze we
partook of our meal coughing and
spluttering it is true but the smoke
in the eyes and throat was a mere noth-
ing to the mosquito nuisance

  i think that for the time being the
mosquitoes spurred us forward as much
as did our fear of being forestalled in
our quest mounting higher on our
left where a cold wind blew instead of
dipping down into the next wooded val-
ley we found peace at last as we
tramped along on this crest where our
view was no longer cramped where at
last wre could see more than the 
knoll before us or the next abyss of
w-oods  noticed apache constantly
scanning the country a though he was
trying to take his bearings

  donoghue who was now more like
his rational or irrational self so
seemed to waken up to his surround-
ings and fell to the same employ

  it was to the valley westward now
that we were upon the ridge that they
directed their attention donoghue
his loose jaw hanging his teeth biting
on his lips posted on ahead of us and
suddenly he stopped stood revealed
against the blue peak of the mountain
on whose ridge we now traveled in an
attitude that bespoke some discovery
he was on a little eminence of the
mountains shoulder a treeless mound
where boulders of granite stood about
in gigantic ruin with other granite out-
posts dotted down the hill into the midst
of the trees which stood there small
and regular just as you see them in a
new plantation at home he shaded
his eyes from the light looked finally
satisfied and then sat down to await
our coming

  apache stepped forward more brife-
ly quick and eager we trotted up the


the popl lav magazine

rise where donoghue merely pointed
into the valley that had now for over
an hour been so eagerly scanned there
far off among the green forest bottom
the leaden yray glint ot a lake showed
among the wearisome woods

  ah wvll have a smoke-up said
apache with an air of relief so we
sat down on our blanket-rolls in the
sunlight there was a gleam in my
companions eyes a look of expectation
on their faces and after that smoke-
up apache spoke with a determined
voice dropping ills cigarette-end and
tramping it with his heel

   we camp at that lake to-night said
he

  to-night said  in astonishment
for it seemed to me a monstrous length

lo	go before nightfall blit he merely
nodded his head vehemently and said
again to-night and then after a
pause we lose time said he there
may be others and we rose to our
feet

  we couldnt camp up here any-
how said donoghue looking round

   it was truly a weird sight there for
we could see so many valleys now hol-
lows gulches clefts in the chaos of the
mountains here white masts of trees
all lightning-struck on a blasted knoll
there a rocky cut in the face of the
landscape like a monstrous scar at an-
other place a long-toothed ridge that
must have broken many a storm in its
day besides already though it was
but afternoon a keen icy-cold wind
ran like a draft there and the voice of
the wind rose and died in our ears
from somewhere in that long rocky
backbone with a sound like a railway-
train going by and so it would arise
and cease again and then cry out else-
where in a voice of lamentation low
and mournful

  apache kid was looking round and
round his eyes wide and bright

   i should like to see this in winter
said he when leaves fall and cold
winds come

  theres no mortal man ever saw
this in winter said donoghue and
no man ever will

   i saw apache kid linger and look on

that terrible and awesome landscape
with a half-frightened fondness and
then he cast one more glance at the
leaden gray of the lake below and an-
other at a peak on our right and his
bearings thus in mind led the way
downward into that dark and forbid-
ding valley

   i shall never forget the journey down
to that lake

   winding here winding there using
the ax frequently as the thin trees i
mentioned were passed and we entered
the virgin forest below close and
tangled we worked slowly down-hill
and it was with something of pleasure
that we came at last again onto what
looked like a trail through the forest

  we were on the track of the in-
domitable buck again  thought iiut
it was not so his trail had kept direct-
ly on upon the hill apache kid told
me

   i thought you saw it from the knoll
there he said and then with a queer
look on his face but you cant go back
now to look on it man do you know
lhat a hunger takes me often to go
back and see iu-t such places as lhat
on the summit there   take an abso-
lute dread that i must die without ever
seeing them again there are places i
cannot allow myself to think of lest that
comes over me that forces--yes forces
-me to go back again for one look
more i love a view like that more than
ever any man loved a woman

  donoghue looked round to me and
touched his forehead and shook his
head gently

   rathouse he said crazy as ever

they make em

  but this is a trail we have come
onto sure enough i said

   my companions looked at it quietly
and i noticed how they both at once
unslung their winchesters from their
shoulders for donoghue had again
taken his share of our burdens

  not exactly a trail said apache
kid at least neither an indians trail
nor a bucks trail this time what was

that donoghue

   a sharp crack as of a branch broken
near us came distinctly to our cars
lost cabin mine



     donoghue did not answer directly
  but said instead

     youwalk first let francis here in
   the middle ill come last and dono-
   ghue dropped behind me

    apache nodded and we started on
  our way

     neither to left nor right could we
   see beyond a few feet so close did the
   underbrush whelm the way

     the sound of our steps in the still-
   ness was more eery than ever to my
   ear  felt that  should go barefoot
   here by right soundless stealthy
   watching every foot of the way for a
   lurking death in the bushes

    crack sounded again a broken
  branch on our left

    well said apache softly-i was
  treading almost on his heels and dono-
  ghue was close behind me-twigs dont
  snap of their own accord like that in
  midsummer

     we kept on however not hastening
  our steps at all but at the same even
  steady pace and suddenly again in the
  stillness-crack p

     again a branch or twig had snapped
  near-by in the thick woods through
  which we could not see

chapter xvii

the com inq of mike can lan

      here was a cold shiver ran in my
   spine at that second crack for it was
   fearsome to know that some live thing
   man or beait -was following us up
   through the bushes

     its a lion sure thing donoghue
   said behind me and its goin at this
   stalking of us darned careless too i
   wisht we could ge to a clear place and
   give him a chance to show himself

     lion asked i astonished

     yes-panther that is said apache
   kid

     in the phraseology of the country
 that is i suggested

l apache looked over his shoulder at
  me

     you are pretty cool tor a tender-
   foot he remarked this is a bad
   spot for us to be stalked by a beast

like that let me come behind now
larry lie continued we arc- getting
to a clear place i think and lie mav
spring before we get out

  not you said larry just vou go
on ahead and let the lad keep in be-
tween

  here the bushes thinned out consid-
erably and when we reached this opened
part donoghue bade us walk straight
on

  dont look back said he let him
think we don t know lies followin
give him a chance to cross thi n
glade well stop just inside them
farther trees and if he shows himself
there well get him then sure thing
what between men and beasts we cut-
tingly have been followed up some tlv-
trip and tm gcttin tired of it t n
here followin up has got to end

  but though we carried out dono-
ghues suggestion crossing the open
space entering again on the path where
it continued down-hill in the fore t
again and halting there the lion did
not show himself

  it was here while standing a little
space waiting for the panthers appear-
ance if panther it was that shadowed
us that apache kid pointed a finger at
the ground before us where a tiny
trickle of water in crossing the path
made it muddy and moist

  see the deer marks he whispered
neat arent they this you see is a
game trail from the hills down to the
lake- 

  no good broke in donoghue he
aint going to show himself

  so we passed on and soon the way
became more precipitous the under-
brush cleared  the trees thinned  and in
a jog trot we at last went rattling down
the final incline and came ryht our with
the impetus of that run upon the open
ground around the lake though of the
lake itself now that we were at its
level we could discern little-only tiny
grav glimpses so closely was it
thronged about by rushes and they so
tall 	

  a thousand frogs were singing ma-
king quite a din in our ears so pent in
was the sound in that cuplike hollow


the popuur magazine

but wearv as we were we rejoiced to
have come to our desired camp and soon
were sitting fed and contented round
the fire

  of all our camps so far this seemed
to me the most secure consequently
it horrified me a little when apache kid
remarked taking his cigarette from his
lips 

  where do you think canlan will be

to-night 

  donoghue considered the burning

io

  oh  allowing for him getting on
to us pulling out even the day after
we left and allowing for him starling
out right then he cant be nigher here
than a days journey coming into the
country the way he would do it-over
the shoulder of mount baker and in
that ways

  liell be over behind there then
said apache pointing right over that
ridge sitting by his lonesome camp and
perhaps half a dozen fellows dogging
him up too eh

  like enough said donoghue but
hes accustomed to bein dogged up

  those who live in glass houses-

remarked apache kid with a laugh
that had no real merriment in the ring
of it

  donoghue raised his eyes to apaches
across the fire and laughed back and
they both seemed to fall into a reverie
after these words presently apache
kid snorted and seemed to fling the
thoughts aside that had been occupying
him but anon he fell brooding again
biting on his lip and closing an eye to
the glow

  it was after one such long medita-
tive gazing into the glowing and leap-
ing embers that he spoke lo me and
with such a ring in his voice- as caused
me to look upon him with a new in-
terest the tone of the voice it seemed
to me hinted at some deep thought

  where do you come from francis
he asked what is your nationality

  why im a cosmopolitan said i
half smiling as one is prone to do when
a man askshim some trivial matter with
a voice as serious as though he spoke
of strange things

   yes we all are said apache kid
putting aside my lightness

   i le mused again plucking his finger-
knuckles and then turned an eye to
donoghue who was already surveying
him under his watchful brows

   shall i tell him he asked

  tell him what said donoghue
looking uncomfortable  thought as
though this mood f his partners was
one he did not relish

  tell him what we are-how we live
-all that 

  from apache to me and back again
donoghue glanced and then oh
tell it you like said he there wont
no harm come from telling him hes
safe hes all right is francis

   again there was a pause

   well said apache kid finally end-
ing ls reverie the fact i that we-
donoghue and i-except upon occasion
when we want to make some sort of a
character for ourselves to show a visi-
ble means of support-the fact is we
are-

   spit it out said donoghue spit
it out it aint everybody has the cour-
age to do it

   i considered what was coming

   the fact is said apache kid we
are what they call in this country road-
agents-make our living by holding up
stage-coaches and-

  by gum weve held up more nor
stage-coaches cried donoghue and
began fumbling in an inner pocket with
eager fingers

  and banks said apache kid ga-
zing on me to see the effect of this dis-
closure

   donoghue stretched across to me his
loose face gleaming with a kind of jov

  read that he said read what
that says and he handed me a long
newspaper cutting

   what i read on the cutting was

darin hollvii on the a t  s f

route the twosome gang
again at work

   thats us said donoghue gloat-
ing it reads pretty good but apache
here says there aint no sense in the
lost cabin mine



headin about the twosome gang-says
them journalist boys is no good seems
to me a right slick notice-thats us
anyway

  apache kid seemed disturbed an-
noyed

   well what do you think he said
 fixing me with bis eye

   im sorry said i

  donoghue threw back his head and
laughed

  its not the right sort of way to
live said apache kid questioning-
ly you know i can make out a fine
case in its defense

  yes i replied i have no doubt
you could and thats just what rflakes
me all the more sorry to think of your
doing this still i feel that your hav-
ing told me prevents my stating an
opinion

  if some one else had told- he

 began

  then i might speak said i

  should it not be the other way
about he asked half smiling

   perhaps it should said i but if
 you honor me by telling me it is enough
 for me just to say i am sorry would
 you have me preach

   he looked on me with great friendli-
 ness

   i understand the sentiment said he
 buc i should like you to preach if you
 wish

   well said i i have no doubt you
 could with the brains ou have and
 your turn for sophistry make out a
 very entertaining defense for such a
 life murder as a fine art you know
 and--

  murder asked donoghue but
apache kid silenced him with a ges-
ture and i continued

  but neither you nor those who
heard your defense could treat it other-
wise than as a piece of airy and mis-
placed misdirected wit on a par with
your misplaced love of adventure

   he nodded at that part and his face
 cleared a little

  that but makes me all the more

sorry said i to know you are-

 i paused a parasite  blurted out

  parasite he cried and his hand

 flew down to his holster wavered and
 fell soundless on his crossed legs

  it was the first time he had looked
on me in anger

  whats parasite aked donoghue
  a louse said apache kid

  hell drawded donoghue and
glanced at me you need lookin
after

  there are parasites and parasites
said i in this case it is more like
these deer-lice we came by in the for-
est

  we had suffered from these but i
have not said anything of them for it
is not pleasant

  w ell drawled donoghue they are
fighters anyway they are you kind
o respect them

  apache kid smiled

  res he said in a low voice its
the right word nevertheless
donoghue jeered

  waal heres where i come in
heres the beauty ofnot being educa-
ted to big words nor what they mean
nor bein able to follow a high-toned
talk except the way a man follow  a
poor-blazed trail

  apache surveyed him with interest
for a moment and then again turning to
me he heaved a little sigh and said

  i wonder if you would do something
for me after we get through with this
expedition if i were to give you a lit-
tle wad of bills enough for a years
holiday at home i wonder if youd go
and take a squint at the house where
my folks lived when i left home find
out if they are still there and il not
trace them up youd need to promise
me not to let that sentimental side of
you run away with you  ou d need to
promise not to go and tell them i m
alive for im sure they have given me
up for dead years ago and mourned the
allotted space of time that men and
women mourn-and forgotten it would
only be opening fresh wounds to hear
of me they have grieved for my
death i would not have them mourn
for my life but i-well i sometimes
wonder you understand what i mean

and-

  watch your eye roared donoghue


the popular magazine

watch your- but a shot out of the

forest sent him flying along the ground
he having risen suddenly and stretched
for his rifle

  instead of clutching ii he went far
beyond plowing the earth with his out-
stretched hands and right on the first
report came a second and apache cried

oh r

  he sagged down all in a heap but i
hung round for my revolver-the win-
chester  had had no practise with i
heard the quick dull plod of running
feet and before i could get my finger
on my weapon a voice was bellowing
out

  dont shoot man  dont shoot its
canlan  mike canlan you aint hos-
tile to mike canlan

  i wheeled about and there he was
trailing his smoking rifle in his left
hand and extending his right to me
mike canlan little mike canlan with
the beady eyes the parchmentlike
pockmarked face and the boys body

  had my revolver been to hand he
had been a dead man i verily believe-
he or i as it was  leaped on him
crying

  murderer murderer

  down came my fist on his head and
at the jar his rifle fell from his grasp
the next stroke took him on the lips
sending him backward i pounded him
till my arms were wearv he lying there
with his faded pockmarked face and
his colorless eyes dancing in pain and
crying out let up  let up you fool 
we aint hostile its canlan lie
cried between blows mike canlan
at last i did let up and stood back
from him

  he sat up and wiped the blood from
his mouth and spat out a tooth

  ah lad he said heres a fine way
to repay me for savin your life think
 couldnt have laid you out stark and
stiff there aside them two

  my gorge rose to hear him talk thus
easy i could have done it he went
on but i didnt and why

  he sidled to me on his hams without
attempting to rise and held up a finger
to me

  why lad you saved my life once so

 spared yours this blessed night thats
me thats mike canlan and see here

lad von and me now-

  silence i cried drawing back
from his touch as he crept nearer

  i had seen murder done of the most
horrible find  had seen a big-hearted
sparkling-eyed man not yet in his
prime struck out of life in a moment
what he was telling me of himself was
nothing to me now i only knew that
i had come to like him and that he was
gone-slain by this little insignificant
creature that you could not call a man
and i had seen another man whom i
did not altogether hate sent to as sum-
mary an end  held this man who
talked in the singsong voice at my feet
in horror in loathing i bent to feel
the heart of apache kid for  thought
i saw a movement in his sun-browned

neck as of a vein throbbing and-

  oh theyre dead dead and done
with cried canlan if they wasnt
id shove another shot into each of em
just to make sure but theyre dead
men for canlan killed em

  if they wasnt id shove another
shot into each of them

  the words rang in my ears with
warning i had just been on the point
of trying to raise apache kid a cry of
joy was almost on my lips to think that
life was not extinct but the words
warned me and i turned about

  hes dead aint her said canlan
and i lied to him

  yes i replied he is dead and

as for you-

  as for me-nothing said canlan
ami he looked along his gleaming barrel
at where my heart fluttered in my
breast

  you and me said he has to come
to terms right now oh i dont disre-
spec you none for not takin kindly to
this i like you all the better for it
but think of what vouve fallen into all
through me heres half shares in the
lost cabin mine for you now instead
of a paltry third-half shares my lad
how does that catch you

  i was not going to tell him the terms
i was here on but i said
lost cabn mine



  tut down your rifle then and let us
talk it over

  come now thats better said can-
lan cheerily but i noticed that a nerve
in his left cheek kept twitching oddly as
he spoke and his head gave constant
nervous jerks left and right like a man
shaking flies away from him and he
sniffed constantly and  think was
quite unaware that he did so but i
did not wonder at his nervousness after
such a heinous deed as he had per-
formed that evening

chapter xviii

the lost cabin is found

  come come said canlan suddenly
with an access of the facial twitching
and another sudden jerking of his head
if thems your blankets pack em up
and lets git out o this back to my
camp the other side of the lake

  i thought it as well to obey him for
if either of these men yet lived and
should by any fortune emit as much as
a moan i knew that canlan would
make a speedy end then if they lived
the best  could do for them was to
leave them

  and yet there was another thing that
 might do-snatch up one of the re-
volvers and straightway mete out jus-
tice-no less-upon this murderer

  but he was on the alert and shoved
his w inchester against my neck as i
stooped tying my blankest-roll with my
eyes surreptitiously measuring the dis-
tance to the nearest weapon

  see here he said i cant be run-
nin chances with you ive let you off
already but i cant be givin you
chances to kill me now funny thing
it would be for me to let you oft for
having saved my life once and then
you turn round and plug me now eh
that would be a skin kind of a game to
play on a man if thats your gun layin
there with the belt you can buckle on
the belt but keep your hands off the
gun or i gets tired o my kindness
see 

  lie snarled the last word at me and
over my shoulder i saw the leer on his

gray face as he spoke so i packed my
blankets without more ado and buckled
on my belt with the revolver in its
holster hanging from it and at can-
lans suggestion took also a bag of flour
with me

  i guess there aint no call to see
what them two has in their pocket by
way of dough said he we dont
have no need for feelin in dead mens
pockets now-you and me and he
winked and laughed a dry crackling
nervous laugh and stooped to lift a
torch from our fire

  with this raised in his hand he
whirled about on me and said now
remember i trusts you and led off at
a brisk pace from the trodden circle of
the camp-fire he hail the tail of his
eye on me and i followed at once

  we skirted the lake keeping under
the trees the torch sending the twisted
shadows flying before us and bringing
them up behind and just at the bend
of the lake i looked back ai that camp
and it brought to my mind the similar
or almost similar scene  had witnessed
in the place of smoldering tumps be-
hind camp kettle

  we plodded round the mend of
this little lake and then a horse whin-
nied in the gloom and here we are
cried canlan and stooping he thrust
the torch into the embers of the fire he
had evidently haa there and trodden
out suddenly he kicked it together
again and soon the flames were leaping
up vigorously then he turned and
looked on me

  well said he you and your
friends must ha traveled pretty quick
clever lads clever lads did you
know that you was gom to try and
spoil mike canlan s game diat day 
gave you good-by at baker city- 

  not i i replied i did not know
then that vou knew the secret

  ah well i did clever lad apache
thought himself i guess siinkin away
down to camp kettle and cuttin in that
ways well i aint surprised he took
that way he knows it well if all
stories is true hes played hide-and-
seek in that same valley more nor once
with somebody after him


the popular magazine

  he blinked on me and then sniffed
twice and suddenly pursed his lips and

said

  but that aint here nor there are
you on to take my offer o lialf-shares

in thisr

  the whole man was still loathsome to
me and i cried out

  no no and would to heaven i
had never heard of this horrible busi-
ness

  wcll drawled canlan im get-
tin some tired o havin no sleep nights
for sittin listenin for fellers follerin
me up not that theyd kill me in my
sleep i guess im too preciouslike
for that ive been keepin myself up

	tanglefoot all the way in but i
didnt bring nigh enough for them
mountains and its give out its give
out this last day and a night and by
jiminy im gettin them again i feel
em cornin on it aint good for a man
like me wantin nr tonic say and
his face twitched aga im jest hold-
in myself together now by fair devils
desperation when i get to the end o
this journey im gettin some scared my

brain-pan will jest- he stopped

abruptly and began on a fresh track
well its natural i guess for you to
feel bad to-night you bein partners o
them fellers so recent but youll be
better come morning say if i lay
down and sleep you wont shoot me
sleepin eh

  i wont do that said i

  thats a bargain then he cried
and before  could say another word lie
threw himself down beside the fire

  he drew his hand over his brow and
showed me it wet

  thats for wantin liquor he said
a man what dont know the crave
cant understand it i know what t
need though sleep-thats what i
need ami im jest goin to force myself
to sleep

  i made no reply but looked on him
as he lay and perceived that his ghast-
lyface was all clammy in the fire-glow
as he reclined in this attempt to steady
his unstrung nerves for me i sat on
scarcely heeding the noises of the mid-
night forest  heard a mud-turtle ever

and again with that peculiar sound as
of a pump being worked that was
a sound new to me but the other cries
-of the wildcats- heeded little

  once or twice i thought of taking a
brand from the lire to light me round
to the camp across the lake that i
might discover whether indeed both my
friends were dead but as i turned
over this thought of return in my mind
canlan brought down his arms again
from above his head v here they had
lain relaxed and opening his eves
rolled on his side and looked up at me

  dont you do it he said

  do what  inquired

  what you was think in of he re-
plied

  and what was that 

  you know he said thickly and
grimly and i know two men alone
in the mountain- cant ever hide their
thoughts from each other mind you
that

  what was i thinking of doing
then i asked

  thats all right he said you
cant bluff me

  well what then i cried irritated

  he sat up

  you was thinkin of goin right off
right now no it wasnt to get in
ahead of me at the cabin mine im
beginning to guess that apache kid
didnt let you know so much as that
but you was just feelin so sick and
sorrvlike that you thought o getting up
quiet and takin my boss there and-

 he was watching my face as he
spoke peeting up at me and sniffing
with a kick he got the fire into a blaze
but without taking his eyes from me
then no you wasnt thinkin that
either he said in a voice as of disap-
pointment that his power of mind-read-
ing seemed at fault

  denied if  dew know what you
was thinkin he acknowledged oh
youre deeper than most he went on
but ill get to know you yet yes
siree ill see right through you yet

  he lav down after this vehement
talk as though exhausted wiping the
sweat from his brow where it gleamed
in the little furrows of leathery skin
lost cabin mine

  in the deft of lus chin i noticed one
  bead that evaded his hand gather and
  drop he was not a pretty man  as-
  sure you

    a feeling as of pride came over me
  to think that this evil man was willing
  to take my word that i would not med-
  dle him in his sleep as i saw him close
  his eyes once more-this time really
  asleep i think

    but to attempt to return to apache
  kids camp i now was assured in my
  mind would be a folly at a merest
  movement of mine canlan might
  awaken and if he suspected that i en-
  tertained a hope of at least one of my
  late companions being alive he might
  himself be shaken in his belief in the
  deadly accuracy of his aim

    i pictured him waking to find me
i stealing away to apaches camp and
stealthily following me up i even pic-
 tured oijr arrival at the farther shore
 -the still glowing fire both my com-
 panions sitting up bleeding and dazed
 and trying to tend each other canlan
e marching up to them while they were
still in that helpless predicament and
blowing their brains from his winches-
r ters mouth so i sat still where i was
and eventually dozed a little myself till
i morning came to the tree-tops and
 slipped down into the valley and glowed
down from the sky and then canlan
awoke fairly and stretched himself and
yawned a deal and moaned god god
god -three times

    and t thought to myself that this
  reptile of a man might well cry on god
  on waking that morning

    neither he nor i each for our own
  reasons ate any breakfast my belong-
  ings i allowed him to pack on his horse
  with his own so that i might not be
  burdened with them the chance of a
  tussle with canlan being still in my
  mind then after we had extin-
  guished the fire a thought came to me
  it was when i saw that he was going
  to strike directly up-hill through the
  forest that i scented an excuse to get
  back to my comrades true my hope
  that they lived was now pretty nigh at
  ebb for i argued to myself that if life
  was in them they would already havg



managed to follow us aye i be-
lieved that either of them supposing
even that he could not stand would
have crawled along our trail at thefirst
light of day bent upon vengeance for
i had learned to know them both as
desperate men-though to one of them
despite what i knew of his life i had
grown exceedingly attached

ill go back to our old camp said
i and bring along an ax if you are
going right up that way we may
need it to clear a way for the horse
he wheeled about

  say lie said what are you so
struck on goin back to your camp for
guess ill come with you and see just
what you want

  he looked me so keenly in the eye
that i said at once knowing that to
object to his presence would be the
worst attitude possible come then
and stepped out but when he saw that
i was not averse to his company he
cried out

  no no i have an ax here that
will serve the turn if we need to do any
cutting but i reckon we wont need
to use an ax none its up this here
dry watercourse we go and there wont
be much clearin wanted here

  it was now broad day and as i
turned to follow canlan again i gave up
my old friends for dead

  the mans short broad back and
childish legs and the whole shape of
him seemed to combine to raise my
gorge

  i would be liker a man i thought
if i struck this reptile dead and the
thought was scarce come into my mind
and must i think have been glittering
in my eyes when lip flashed arounj on
me his colorless face and said he
remember i trust my life to you
i take it that youve agreed to my oft or
of last night to go half-shares on this
god knows youll have to look after me
by nightfall this blessed day-unless
there may be a lot o drink in that
cabin

  at the thought he absolutely
screamed

a lot o drink  a lot o drink and


the populsr magazine

away lie went with a sign to me to fol-
low scrambling up the watercourse be-
fore his horse which followed with
plodding hoofs head rising and falling
doggedly and long tail swishing left
and right i brought up ihe rear and
thus we climbed the greater part of the
forenoon with occasional rests to re-
gain our wind till at last we came out
on the bald shorn last crest of the
mountain

  canlan marched the pony side on to
the hill to breathe and he himself blow-
ing the breath from him in gusts and
sniffing a deal he pointed to the long
black hilltop stretching above us

  a mountain o mud he said
thats it right enough some folks
thinks that everything that prospectors
says they come across in the mountains
is jest their demented imaginatings
like but i seen mountains o mud be-
fore theres a terror of one in the
crows nest pas away up the east
kootenai and theres one in colorado
down to the warm springs country
you can feel it quiver under you when
you walk on it-all same jelly see
-you see that black crest there thats
all mud this here where we are is
good enough earth though all right
with rock into it its here that we
turn now let me see-

  he took some fresh bearings look-

ing to the line of hills to the southeast
 thought  could pick out the notch at
the summit over there through which
apache kid donoghue and i had
come  and then he led off again-along
the hill this time his head jerking ter-
ribly and his whole body indeed so
that now and again he leaped up in
little hopping steps like one afflicted
with st vitus dance

  up a rib of the mountain a it might
be called he marched i now walking
level with him for  must confess i
was excited

  and then i saw at last what  had
journeyed so painfully and paid so
cruelly to see-a little shack or cabin
of untrimmed logs of the color of the
earth in which it stood there just a
stones cast from us between the rib on
which we stood and the next rib lhat
gave a sweeping contour to the hill and
then broke off short so that the moun-
tain at that place went down in a sharp
slope climbed upon lower down by in-
significant scrubby trees but there-
there was the cabin sure enough there
was our journeys end

  canlan turned his ashen face to me
and his yellow eyeballs glittered

  it looks as we were first he said
his voice going up at the end into a
wavering cry and his lips twitching
convulsively

to be continued

a mere matter of business

the manager of the big store stood stock-still outside of the little boxlike
chamber which held the telephone of the establishment for he was a very
startled manager indeed within the chamber he could hear miss jones
the typist speaking and this is a scrap of the conversation the scandalized man
overheard

     love you dear and only you im weeping my heart away yes my
darling speak to me once more i love you dear- love you sol

    the young woman rang off and stepped out of the cabinet to confront the
angry manager

    miss jones he said that telephone has been fixed where it is for the pur-
pose of convenience in conducting business and not for love-making in office
hours i am surprised at you dont let it occur again

  the young woman froze him with a glance	

    i was ordering some new music from the publishers for no  department
she explained icily

    and then the manager felt that this wgs a cold world indeed
mr garfields matrimonial experiment

                       by w alter hackett

                     a pretty dangerous experiment it was that mr garfield
                     tried one we should hardly care to advise husbands to
                     copy all sorts of trying complications are likely to result
                     here they are principally humorous at least to the reade

his is a plain narrative
of john garfields
matrimonial experi-
ment garfield told it
to me himself and i
will repeat it to you as
nearly as possible in
his own words i
have his permission to do this as both
of us believe it may be of some value
 settling the marriage question if
it does we shall expect to be looked
on as public benefactors the narra-
tive follows

  i did not marry until i was forty

i never had time until then-i had
hustled from the time i was a kid but
at forty i got hold of a patent that made
my pile after that i had nothing to
do but boss people and count my money

neither of these things was very amu-
sing so i got restless and decided that
what i needed was a home that is
what most men decide when time hangs
heavy on their hands when they get
it it keeps them busy trying to think
of other places that will keep them away
from it

  well as soon as i began to think
about a home i thought about getting
married and when a man begins to
think about getting married it is all
over with him all but the ceremony

that came quickly enough in my case

i was married and settled before i real-
ized it you see when a man has
money the mothers do the rect

  my wife was a nice girl and to do
her justice i think she cared for me my wife

 i mean at fira before she knew me
 which seems to be the only time that
 women care for their husbands when
 she did-well that is what i am going
 to tell you about

   for the first six months our life was
 perfect i never knew anybody could
 be so happy and keep out of jail every
 night when i came home she would be
 waiting to open the door and throw her
 soft white arms around my neck then
 we would call each other pci names and
 sort of coo yes me forty years old
 ami six-feet-two in my stocking-feet and
 talking baby talk and what is more
 i liked it why t used to spend all
 my time during the day thinking up
 new names to call her when i should
 get home one day i tried some of
 them on my stenographer by mistake
 it took two solid hours of oratory to
 make her understand it

   as i said this lasted about six
 months then the novelty wore off
 that is it did for my wife and she
 stopped meeting me at the door in-
 stead she hired a butler-a portly per-
 son with an accusing eye who always
 looked at me as though i was not fit
 to live tt used to take all my courage
 to ring the bell and face him when i
 got home in the evening and i tried
 to let myself in with my latch-key but
 he caught me at it and looked so an-
 noyed and shocked at my bad form that
 i begged his pardon and never tried it

again	

   after i got bv him i used to look for
   fora while i would greet


the popular magazine

her with baby talk not for long
though she would just give me one
cold look one of her eyes and say
john do your utmost not to be a
fool i know that it is hard but do
your best and did you secure seats for
the theater to-night

  well if i had not secured them i
did and right away too not that we
ever went to any musical comedies or
farces or any place where you could
get any amusement no sir she would
not stand for that we used to go and
see plays where everybody was miser-
able because they were married usu-
ally the principal characters ran away
from their husbands or wives with
somebody elses husband or wife after
which they committed suicide then
everybody but me would applaud and
say that after all there was nothing like
real art

   i want to tell you that it was not long
before that sort of thing got on my
nerves it got on my wifes nerves
after a time and she would mope around
in a way that frightened me i could
not do anything to help her because
ever- time she looked at me she moped
more than ever

  then  decided to go and consult my
friend bob ferley bob had been mar-
ried twice and had buried both wives
so i looked on him as a kind of ex-
pert

  lie heard me through and then he
leaned back and lighting a cigar said
garfield you arc only facing a crisis
that every married man must face if
you face it successfully your marriage
will be a success  if you do not nothing
will ever make it so

  that was rather discouraging so i
wiggled a bit in my chair as he went
on

  no woman is happy unless her mind
is occupied if you have sufficient in-
genuity to keep your wifes so you
will have a happy and a pleasant life
if you do not only a judge or an un-
dertaker can give it to you

  naturally i was considerably inter-
ested i leaned forward in my chair
and tapped him on the knee

  what would you suggest said i

that i do to keep my wifes mind

busy 

  ah he replied wagging his head i
at me very solemn there you have me
every woman is different some en-
tirely so in the old days the good old
days i might call them they kept the
women as drudges and slaves they
used to work from before sunup until
after dark and they liked it unhappy
marriages then no one ever heard
of them the womens minds were busy
and they were happy and contented
but nowadays we have the new
thought and the suffragettes are ever
with us both of which are so new that
they are premature and one cannot
treat his woman sensibly so it is neces-
sary to invent ways to keep them from
thinking about themselves

  now i am free to admit  did not
know whether there was any sense in
what he was saying or not but it
sounded impressive so i made up my
mind to act on it after considerable
thinking i hit upon the idea of french
lessons and suggested them to my wife
she jumped at the idea and for three
weeks worked at them with a will-
three happy weeks they were for me-
she was quite like her old self but
about the time he changed the cooks
name from mary to marie the novelty
wore off and she began to mope again
this start had opened up a new line
however and i suggested german that
lasted nine days then followed in
quick succession italian spanish
arabic polish and russian none of
them was continued longer than a week
in despair i suggested chinese but
she declared she was sick of languages

  so we switched to various other ac-
complishments music-instrumental-
lasted two weeks vocal one hour and
forty minutes

  cooking held sway for four days
sewing for three while social-settle-
ment work occupied her for a week
then my ingenuity began to give out
as it was i had been neglecting my
business for some time figuring out new
things to keep her busy  but i had
proved that perley was right when-
ever she was busy we were an ideal
mr garfields matrimonial experiment

married couple accordingly i went to
him again this time with more confi-
dence than ever

  bob i said is there anything that
will keep a woman interested perma-
nently

  yes he answered there is
  what is it  i asked

  a man he replied laconically
well i complained my wife does
not seem to be interested in me

  ah he put in smiling broadly
that is the point you-he empha-
sized the you-are married to her
but i dont understand i said
the only man who permanently in-
terests women he explained is a
man to whom they are not married

  i admit that that struck me all of a
heap

  do you mean i said angrily that
i must permit some other to make love
to my wife in order that we may be
happy together

  i meant what i said he retorted
hotly and he was considerably net-
tled by my tone i simply recited
facts to you i did not offer advice
but bob i said a great deal more
gently is there no other way to inter-
est a woman for all time

  none that i know of he replied
and that ended the interview

  i came away right downhearted it
looked like my marriage was to be a
failure and  hate to fail at anything
besides i was fond of my wife the
darkest hour however usually comes
just before the dawn and it was just
when i was most downcast that i hit
upon a great idea what suggested it
i never could tell i have invented
tons of oilier things that have made
some money and they all came in just
the same way a sudden flash in the
brain and then the whole thing clear
in my mind that is how this came to
me why not let a man who never
existed fall in love with her that
was safe and at the same time should
prove effectual i regarded the thing
as an inspiration

   decided to put the plan into opera-
tion at once so i bought some sta-
tionery and went to my office then

i wrote a letter to my wife in an as-
sumed hand the letter declared that
the writer had seen her driving in the
park-she used to go there every aft-
ernoon-and he could not refrain from
writing to her to express his sincere
admiration that was all i signed it
raymond montgomery it was fine and
high-sounding and romantic

  well i posted it and the next morn-
ing i saw it lying on my wifes plate
with the rest of the mail on the break-
fast-table i watched her when she
read it but apparently it made no im-
pression she just rang the bell and
ordered the butler to tell the coach-
man that she would not drive that aft-
ernoon she continued reading her
letters

  that was discouraging but life has
taught me that if you are persistent you
can do anything-or nearly anything
so i wrote another letter in the same
handwriting this time it was one of
apology and regret she had not been
in the park that day the writer said
and he feared his temerity in addressing
her had kept her away lie begged a
thousand pardons and implored her to
continue to drive that he might ee her
now and again it was signed as be-
fore and posted and the next day it
lay by her breakfast-plate she read it
but as before with no apparent interest
and again announced that she would not
drive in the park

  that worried me all that i was
succeeding in doing was in destroying-
one of her occupations-which made it
worse for me therefore i decided that
mr raymond montgomery would write
no more i was rather glum when i
went home that night when she had
nothing to amuse herself with during
the day home was not a very pleasant
place it was a surprise to find her in
better spirits than she had been for
months she was even more than po-
lite to me her mood continued the
same until the next morning at break-
fast when she came to the table she
looked languidly over the mail then
rather anxiously then a quick color
swept into her face and a frown of an-
noyance spread itself upon her brow


tub popvuir magazine

i asked her what the matter was and
she said-well it is not necessary to
repent what she said but it was rather
uncomplimentary she drove that day
and the next morning at breakfast made
no secret oi her disappointment in the
mail she received and i understood
my plan was a success

  accordingly i wrote her another let-
ter and followed it with one every day
she always read them in the same care-
less fashion hut she always looked for
them i knew they were making her
think too she was always so pleasant
and happy the only trouble was keep-
ing- the thing up  could not continue
writing short notes presently it was
letters now no one can continue wri-
ting a one-sided correspondence they
had to be answered well  engaged
a post-office box in my assumed name
anti sent her the number

  she did not answer that i was
thankful she did not too i concluded
she must be tired of the whole tiling
and stopped writing for a day or two
but she moped terribly when i ceased
and  had to begin again

  after that well sir it was like a
nightmare to me it is now for me to
look back upon it i was caught in a
whirlpool one that i had myself crea-
ted i could not stop and every letter
got me further into trouble why in
two weeks i was writing love-letters
to my wife under an assumed name and
she was answering them i felt like i
was two different men and i did not
know which  was the sorrier for you
see when t got writing love-letters to
her i wrote what i really felt-what i
always longed to tell her but never
dared

  at last the climax came ft had to
she suggested a drive in the park
you do not know the shock it gave me

she had made all the arrangements
when and where we were to meet at
first i decided to do nothing about it
then i feared that in her disappoint-
ment she might do something rash so
i went to the street corner she had in-
dicated presently a carriage drove up
and i jumped in she was sitting alone
in the vehicle and when she saw who
it was her face went white and her hand
went to her heart

  what do you mean by this she ex-
claimed after a moment by george
sir  admired her more

  why-er-why i stammered i-
er- wanted you to know that i am
raymond montgomery i wrote you
all those letters

  it sounded foolish when i got it out
worse than that even but it was the
only thing i could think to say

  you wrote those letters she re-
peated with tine scorn a clod like
you never

  but  succeeded at last in convincing
her that i did oh but i was happy to
convince her if she loved him surely
she would love me and all would be
well that shows how much  didnt
know about a woman

  so you thought it fine port to make
a fool of your wife she asked bitter-
ly when i had done

  i declared to her that this was not so
-that in those letters i had written her
of the real love that i felt for her-
the love that she would never let me
express she heard me through without
a word then she asked me if we
might drive home

  the next day she left me and went
back to her family on the day follow-
ing i was served with a summons in a
divorce-suit ever since whenever i
take a long breath it takes all my
strength to keep from swearing
c

almost every day we receive let-
ters from those who wish to write
stories for the magazine and want in-
formation as to the rules as many of
them express it there are no rules
any one who writes a story in the eng-
lish language worth the telling and in-
telligible is sure of a hearing in this
office at the same time there are one
or two points about the stories we are
looking for which may interest writers
and a great many who are not writers
because they give you some idea of our
methods in trying to get fiction to suit
the greatest possible number of people

a 

we want stories told in good eng-
lish we dont want any lit-
erary affectation whatever vitality
energy interest-the qualities that make
a story strong and desirable-are very
seldom combined with a literary pose on
the part of the writer shakespeare was
sneered at by the learned ben jonson
for his lack of culture and literary qual-
ity- remember that writing a story is
only telling it on paper if you want
t find out whether it is good or not
whether it is worth while whether we
and our readers will be interested in il
apply the following test

a 

wait till you are at a party or
gathering of some kind of good
nice well-educated men and women
then tell your story tell it as if it
happened to a friend of yours in the
third person and put all the ginger and
enthusiasm all the descriptive power
possible into your telling tell it as if
it were true note the effect oil your
audience if the man you buttonhole
looks bored from the start dont trouble

to write the story it he becomes inter-
ested go ahead with it if gradually all
the other conversation in the room be-
comes silent if at the close of your
narrative you find the company all lis-
tening to you with breathless attention
go ahead rejoicing for the indications
point that your story is worth while

a a

whenever in doubt as to some
particular point in a story think
cf your roomful of nice american peo-
ple and its effect on them if vou are
meditating any discussions or expressions
at which some of the people present
women especially would be likely to rise
and announce in icy tones that they
must be going leave them out they
are in bad taste and things that are in
bad taste dont belong in a good story
the whole point of a story is that it
must interest in a pleasant not a grue-
some or shocking way that it must
leave a good taste in the mouth and
that if possible it must give some new
insight into the characteristics and con-
ditions of men and women

a a

thats all there is to it it looks
simple but it is harder than it
looks we want you to send in stories
lo the popular if you think you have
it in you to write them but you must
remember that in doing so you are en-
tering into competition with the best
writers in the w-orld a man may be
the pride of his village as a baseball-
pitcher but fall down deplorably if
tried out by the chicago champions for
instance the big-league team has the
choice of players not from one village
but from the whole country we are
searching hard for good material all over

i
 chat wnh you continued

this country and in europe as well so
that if you qualify with us you have
beaten out a good many others we
print a terribly small proportion of the
material that we examine and print
only the best

a 

if you really are a good writer you
wont be discouraged by anything
that we have aid we are giving you
the best of our advice on the question
and it is the result of wide experience
if you are going o write be sure that
you have a story to tell before you
start and remember always that you are
talking to your readers through the
medium of the printed word it is your
business to interest them and get them a
little excited if possible about what you
have to say dont ever try to impress
them with your literary style or with
any airs and graces be honest and
straightforward in writing you will
find that it pays as it does in talking

next months magazine will open
with a complete novel by arthur
stringer the gun-runner it is a
full-length novel a publisher is already
preparing to bring it out in book form
at  it is a better bigger more
thrilling book than either the wire-
tappers or phantom wires by the
same author we remember the prom-
ise as to future standards we made a
month ago and we are going to deliver
the goods there is not another maga-
zine in the world that would plan to
publish a story of this length interest
and importance complete in one number
that isnt boasting it is the cold-
blooded statement of an absolute fact
think it over tsnl it so

tut- gun-runner is a wire-
less story of the kind that
stringer alone can write it has a high
tension an atmosphere a quality of ro-
mance and breathless excitement that

you cannot find anywhere else it is to
be followed by a new series of stories
by stringer which we will announce
next month we have them on hand
now and are waiting anxiously for the
time to come when you will read them

 

th ere are a dozen things in the janu-
ary popular each worth featuring
for itself  here isnt a story in it that
wont make people talk and think about
it the big naval story the fleet
with salt on its tail is a vivid de-
scription of an engagement in which an
entirely new strategy is adopted read
it it is away out of the ordinary her-
bert kaufmans business story the
fifth john james ought to be read by
every man who earns his living by the
way of business dont say that there
isnt plenty of romance and adventure
in modern business that there are not
opportunities for the man with brains
read the story it was written by a
man who knows something about the
business world himself

 

by this time you have all made the
acquaintance of ralph d paine
 or the next year his work will be a
regular feature of the popular a story
or a complete novel appearing in every
issue all the characters whom you
met while reading the stroke-oar
will be heard from again hector
alonzo mcgrath who tried so hard and
failed for all the teams makes good
triumphantly and surprisingly in the
story which appears next month how
hector won his y

 

we promised to tell you something
this month about a new find it
is a story a long story called bill
harris-his line by howard field-
ing it is so unlike any other story
that we have ever read that it would
be very hard indeed to give an adequate
description of it it tells of an associa-
tion formed for the reform of a number
of prominent criminals and has more
interest plot incident and character
than we ever expected to see in a tale
of its length look for the first part
of this story in the february number

     can you hope in any other way so sale and sure a- this to
  have so large an independent income in so short a time

     i believe the purchase of texas irrigated lund to lie the st
  way for a man of enisli means to make himself independent
  and  believe  am qualined to par judgment as i have i-en in-
  terested in irrigation matters locally and nationally for lb year

     the results are simply astounding to those who are uulawlt
  lar with the great subject of irrigation

     and  believe the happiest man these days is the man with
 the little ten acre irrigated farm-president kooxrvell mo
 even  acres is enough to support a family and keep it lmsy

     the owner or a ten acre irrigated karin doe-ut h-n- i
 knuckle to the boss nor strain his conscience in the struggle
 of the intense commercialism of the day

     his income is practically untouched by financial depression 

     his living and peace of mind are not depcadmit upon tlx
 whim of any man

     he is king in ills own little domain

     he can make his little ten acres earn as much as a quarter
  section  acres unirrlgated would produce-as nunll of be-
  tween twentv and eighty thousand dollars in cash would tulug
  loaned out at  per cent

     he has his close neighbors his telephone good roads school

     at the end of each year-if von take more than a year to

natures choicest food

  the choicest michigan beans run 
nitrogenous- nutriment those are
the beans we buy

  they cost us sometimes as high as
eight times what other beans would cost
 but the value is there

  we bake those beans in live steam so
the skins are unbroken they are baked

s until they are mealy yet they are nutty
because they are whole

   we bake in small parcels in a heat of 
i degrees the result is our beans are
digestible they dont ferment and form
gas

  then we make a tomato sauce from vine-
ripened tomatoes it costs us five times
what common tomato sauce sells for in bulk

  we bake that tomato sauce into the beans
thus we get our delicious blend-that
sparkling zest

  the result is a food as nutritious as
meat costing one-third as much an appe-
tizing food-a food that all people like
a food ready to serve

  we have made beans the popular food-
the every-day food-the choicest dish on

to prepare it

we are baking more beans by several

times over than any other concern in the

c or intermediate weather the long
chesterfield is undoubtedly the
best all-round overcoat it extends a
trifle below the knee is curved very
slightly-if at all-to the figure and
does not flare at the bottom the elab-
orately creased and pressed garments
are not at all manly-looking and one
generally sees them on persons whose
notions and ideas of style are derived
from colored fashion-plates of the
tawdry sort there are always men
who feel that they must go the fash-
ions of the day one better and it is
these who make a mock of even a ra-
tional mode and compel its total aban-
donment

  the chesterfield lias a velvet collar
to match the cloth usually black or me-
dium gray long and wide lapels ironed
to a soft roll and a deep center vent
the object of the vent is to render
walking easier for the ventless coat
hinders the wearers movements and
swishes awkwardly around his legs
folded-back cuffs are rather too pre-
tentious-looking to be acceptable on so
plain a coat as the chesterfield though
they are not incorrect the fly-front
garment has been in vogue for many
years but the newer style is to have
the buttons come through plaids her-
ring-bones faint stripes and shadow
effects are variously used the brown
chesterfield in a deep rich shade

though becoming to few men has an
uncommonness which commends it to
those who seek a treasured expressive-
ness in dress

  the overfrock so-called because it
closely resembles a double-breasted
frock coat is worn chiefly with formal
evening dress the skirts are long
shaped to the waist and a bit full the
cuffs are folded back and narrow
black and gray arc the accepted colors
for no others harmonize with the ex-
treme simplicity of either evening or
afternoon clothes the chesterfield is
quite as proper as the overfrock and
indeed is preferable to accompany aft-
ernoon dress because to wear a frock
greatcoat over a frock undercoat seems
to sin against the fitness of things the
overfrock or paddock as it is popularly
known is no longer considered good
form for morning anti business but is
restricted wholy to ceremonious occa-
sions

  the inverness or cape overcoat is
purely an evening garment it is al-
ways black soft in finish quite long
and satin-lined to the edge it may
have sleeves or not-they are usually
omitted-and has a half-cape no coat
is more picturesque than the inverness
and none rials it in its air of old-world
grace it is an admirable garment for
the theater and functions of an avow-
edly ceremonious nature just why the

correct winter business suit

 inverness is rarely worn except by el-
 derly beaus would be hard to explain
 the younger generation seemingly will
 have none of it preferring the chester-
 field or the overfrock abroad they
 are partial t the inverness and the
 frenchman considers it almost as in-
 dispensable as the evening suit itself

   fur-trimmed overcoats arc good
 form only in the thick nf winter they
 look clearly absurd when worn with-
 out the excuse of befitting weather it
 is better to have the cuffs plain instead
 of fur-trimmed the collar being very
 deep and so as to enable it to be turned
 up over the ears when the wind
 whistles sable mink and astrakhan
 are the preferred furs fur caps are
 not worn in this climate though they

    ur-lined gloves are very comfy
 notably for motoring and the outdoor
 sports though there is little occasion
 lor them in town high storm-boots
 with  aier-proof soles will be found of
 much practical service hiring months
 when snow and slush are underfoot

    bite evening waistcoats-black is
 not worn nowadays-are preferably
 single-breasted and pocketless the
 pocket is superfluous since it is seldom
 use i and moreover it hinders smooth
 laundering the linen waistcoat is too
 stilt and the silk garment cannot be
 laundered but must be dry-cleaned a
 tedious and difficult process  herefore
 the soft cotton waistcoat will be found
 more satisfactory than either this is
 cut at lhe front opening in a shape mid-
 way between the obi l and the new-
 er v egg-shape is perhaps the best
 description of it the lapels and edges
 are silk-stitched some distance from the
 edge and the bottom points are not so
 peaked as formerly there are deep
 side vents and the waistcoat hugs the
 waist

   the correct white evening tie meas-
 ures from one and a half to two and a
 quarter inches and is graduated in form
 w hile both linen ami silk are proper
 materials cotton is soft more pliant
 and yields a firmer fuller knot besides
 being lighter and cooler if a silk lie
 be worn it should harmonize in shade
 and pattern with the waistcoat cords
 tiny detached figures and embroidered
 ends-all are correct and a matter of
 individual preference lawn ties have
 been discarded as the fabric is too
 flimsy for graceful knotting

   in choosing the evening ties the
 shape of the collar worn must be con-
 sidered if it be a poke or a lap-front
 the tie should be broad and adjusted
 straight across rather than pinched in
 the center contrariwise if it be a
 wing-and the wing continues to be
 favored by many men who cannot wear
 the other forms with comfort-the tie
 should be a modified bat-wing snug
 of center and spreading of end

  greatest love story
       written in  years

   this great heart-interest love story was written early in the nineteenth century by a french abbe

priest it is not the kind of story you would expect a priest to write it is the story of the most
beautiful womii in france-the story of an unfaithful woman and her sorrows-and how those sorrows
turned her vacillating affection into the pure gold of iovc it is a story that has a heart thrill on every page-
a story that appeals to every man or woman who ever loved or was loved it is the kind of story that a
hungry booklover would spend days in old bookshops looking for-if he knew that such a book existed guy
de maupassant the greatest french story writer at his best never equalled this great story and de
maupassant himself savs that no writer french or american in the past  years has ever produced so
strong a story as this almost unknown book

read this book at our risk

   the first edition of this book was subscribed for at  francs per copy- n copy in nr money
and private editions costing much more than this have from time to time been printed now for the first
time this wonderful book is placed within your easy reach at practically the bare cost of paper ink printing
the edition we offer is the best translation-written into clear strong vivid english that none can fail to
understand and appreciate instead of selling this ediion at a high price per copv we are going to give it
away almost in connection with subscriptions to the womans world the womans world is the greatest
and most fearless publication in the world which now reaches over  homes edwin  sms the
u s district attorney who represented the u s government in the famous  standard oil case
has two articles in the womans world on the white slave trader of today and why girls go astray
mr sims says the white slave traders have reduced the art of ruining voting girls to a national and inter-
national system by reading these articles by the great districl attornev in connection with this book
many pitfalls may be avoided other contributors to womans world are joseph medill patterson icorge
ade geo barr mccutcheon roswell field opie read clara touise burnham ella wheeler  llcox ana
many others the womans world is a great national publication

chip of the flying u

by b m bower

this tale is so thoroughly- imbued with the spirit
of the living breathing wot that the render is
likely to imagine that he himsell is cantering over
the grassv plains and imbibing the pure air of the prairie
in companv with chip weary happy jack and the other
cowbovs of the flying u ranch the story is a comedy
but there are dramatic touches in it that will hold the
reader breathless pathos and humor are adroitly com-
mincled nnd the author seems to be as adept at por-
traying one as the other the little doctor makes a
verv lovable heroine and one doesnt blame c hip in tne
leant for fnlling in love with her the book ejewcr
task would be a pleasant one if all his work had to uo
with such wholesome and delightful stories as chip ot
the flving u if this book doesnt immediately take
rank as one of the best sellers we shall lose faith in tne
discrimination of the american reading public beau i-
fully illustrated in colors by mr charles m kussei 
the greatest painter of cowboy life in america

  white-whiter-whitest

   many soaps are almost white some are
still whiter but only one is whitest-fairy soap
the reason is the quality of fats and oils used-
fairy contains only edible products there are
no dyes high perfumes or adulterations
to deceive the eye or delude the nostril

   fairy is honest soap-all the way
through its price five cents is
x not the measure of its quality
